lord let's think to our feet tonight and and we will read psalm chapter 37 we'll read psalm 37 tonight praise the lord we will read psalm chapter 37 tonight the assay37 and i already didn't mean 37 praise the lord it's actually psalm 137 psalm 137 i hope i'm right yes i'm right praise the lord psalm 127 let's uh let's read uh let's read this in a kind of a responsive way tonight i will read verse one you read verse 2 and then we all will read verse 9 together praise the lord amen by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yeah we wept when we when we remember zion for there they that carried us away captives required of us a son and they that wasted us required us a myth saying sing us one of those songs of zions if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her conan verse seven i will read it and i want you to pay very attention because i will come back to it remember oh lord the children of edom in the day of jerusalem who said racism even to the foundation thereof let's read the last verse together happy shall he be that taketh and dashed the little ones against the stone praise the lord let's pray together heavenly father lord we just want to thank you for your word lord like your prophet said in your word every history in your word is sometimes written in a poetic language and father god but they are hidden truths that lies in every line in every verse father so we are asking tonight that the holy spirit will come with god and take a portion of the word lord and open it this portion that we have read tonight father means something of internal value be said oh god that will draw those closer to you father knowing that god we we just not want to use this opportunity to god to play it in a form of religion but we want to let our house be for you oh god that you will come out of the pages of your word and meet us at the very point of our needs tonight we thank you father we love you and we appreciate you dear god in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seat for the next few minutes that is before us maybe 30 or so um i will i would like to for us to do a little little bit of a review here let's go back to the book of obedience let's go back to the book of opidios we realized that uh we've been kind of for studying the joining of easter and edom and just like we said you know the lord gave obi dyers a vision to be able to search out the hidden things of easter that's why the scripture the verse there in verse 6 says how are the hating things of israel such out how are his hidden things sought out so we realized that can you can you imagine that that god raised up obedience in all of his life brother branham said uh there's not much we know about dire and strange enough that was the only time that brother brennan mentioned ob diary in in that is on te he might have mentioned it sometime but the only time on tape was where he says there is nothing we know about opidia praise the lord now so we but you think about it that god you know bless his mom and his dad with this boy and give them what they needed to raise him up whether he went to school or not we don't know but that god would god in part in his life for one purpose to revere to him the hidden things of easter praise the lord we know that god bless zacharias and elizabeth with a son called john after they have lived all of their lives and anyway in old age but yet god blessed them with that child and just for a six-month ministry and all he was born for was to introduce the messiah six months everything that he went through in his life everything he learned was all gearing to a six-month ministry a voice crying in the wilderness praise the lord and that's the reason why we can believe from the word of god and from the message of the hour that god has a purpose for our lives amen you going to school and and learning getting a career and and everything that you are doing is all intertwining into the the sole purpose that god ordained your life on this earth praise the lord out of your hardship out of your struggle all of your tears they are all in the plan of god just to be able to achieve that one purpose praise the lord can you can you imagine it brother branham says in adoption series he says he says maybe for a mother her purpose was to be able to raise a boy like susanna wesley that someday he will be a preacher that was the only work that god had for her to be able to install into a young man the value of god that someday he will be a preacher praise the lord so we get back to the book of obedience here just one chapter we talked about it the last time but i want to pick up something that is tied into the prophecy there of psalm chapter 137 that we read tonight praise the lord you love the lord tonight you relax it's just a prayer meeting we're kind of trying to uh flex our muscle a little bit we know that the lord there with us this weekend if he never there with you he's there with me surely amen praise the lord amen so uh we had a good time good to have our brother ben and his family back from their trip to pennsylvania and praise the lord thank god for granting you a safe travel and we are glad that you made it back home praise the lord uh [Music] brother eric have a reason to be away this weekend so uh we pray that the lord also will grant him a safe travel now so as we look at this together tonight uh let's read verse one there in the book of obedience the bible says the vision of obedience god said the lord god concerning edom his vision was concerning edom praise the lord and see the way that he uh he brought his message out we have heard a roman from the lord it's like god whispering because god is never into gossip anyway amen and he says and an ambassador is sin among the heating arise yet and let us rise up against her in battle and we read all of this he's talking about edom behold i have made thee small among the hittings thou are greatly despised praise the lord now what i want us to understand is not the people that god is despising there is an attitude amen there is a lifestyle and we will identify them tonight because all of this will bring us to the place where we will we will understand what malachi said easier jacob i love isa i hate well what actually brought that language we will understand that that's that's what i want to go to with this but tonight i just want to do it a little bit around their prophecy there in psalm chapter 37. so hear god looking at these people saying uh that greatly despised malachi said jacob i love eso i hate paul came he said the children not even being born they never even make no choices of their own god says i love the younger and i hate the other so we want to look into this pray that the lord will be able to help us amen so as we go a long year we are further read through this uh the last two uh uh services that we do out on this let's let's travel down a little bit we we read verse 3 talking about the pride of that heart has deceived thee that dwelleth in the clave of the rock whose habitation is high that said in his heart who shall bring me down you know we compared edom you know uh uh confession year to date of lucifer confession in isaiah chapter 14. and i wish i bring me down to the ground down though thou exult thyself as an ego and though they have set the nets among the stars things will i bring thee down said the lord praise the lord now we get to verse six let's drop to verse six that's where we stopped the last sunday how are the things of ether searched out how are his hidden things now if you if you just take this verse it will make you to appreciate the prophet ministry many of us got to know brother branham through the text through the box we were never in the meeting praise the lord but yet when you listen to the tapes and you see uh you know and and and you i mean you are caught up into uh the the discernment the healing which of course i've received a miracle by listening to a tape god reaching mercy i still remember it lying on my bed i still remember how god visited me and but this is a prophet a man that god is using to go back in the life of esau esau lived many years from ob dives many generations now only years but here he said this prophet with a gift of vision he's going to go back to be able to search some of the heating things some of the things that are not even written praise the lord and we believe that that same spirit is here tonight the same spirit that searched the rings and the heart before whom every every life is naked like paul said in the book of hebrew how are the things of esau sesh out how are his hidden things sought out all the men of the confederacy have brought thee even to the border the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee now when we look into the life of easter we saw how you know he he disobeyed his parents uh he knew that his parents were not in favor of him marrying any of the girls from the land of kenneth and he decided to do that he took the anger of his against his brother jacob even against his parents and he became defiant so you will see that as you look at the history we we shared a little bit of that with you right from from abraham and then abraham having isaac there's a little review now and abraham having ishmael praise the lord and then after sarah died abraham married keturah and he had other sons now those sons that abraham had by keturah they are the arabs they are the dwellers of the present-day saudi arabia okay and we see that ishmael also had a 12 songs then we see isaac from isaac now is branching out easter and jacob are we together okay so all of the nations that are around present-day israel are all children from easter ishmael and the sons of keturah and israel is from isaac jacob now so we we see that now that's that's where verse seven comes in play because there was a confederacy that was made ishmael merged with these other he merged with the children i mean yeah easter which is edom merged with the children of of uh ishmael and the rest of the sons of uh uh keturah you know to make a confederacy to come against jacob praise the lord now what we want what i want us to look at tonight there is an evil there's a there's an evil that edom date a sin you can call it sin you can call it iniquity there's an evil that edom date that god never forgot that's what i want us to look at tonight that's what i want for us to study so we see here that there was a confederacy may and uh [Music] verse seven all the men of of that confederacy had brought thee even to the border the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee and prevailed against thee they that eat that bread have lain and won't honor thee there is none understanding in him shall annette in that day said the lord even destroy the wise men of edom and understanding out of the mount of easter praise the lord all the all the mighty men oh tamman if you go back and check the root of israel you'll find out that that name is one of his sons all to the end of every one of the man of easter may be cut off by slaughter for the violence against that brother jacob shame chakra day now this is hundreds of years after easter has died he has gone but out of him has come this this people called the and the the the the hatred the bitterness the easter hard against his brother i mean it was god that intervened that was the reason why god had to meet jacob that night he had to meet the injured that night because nothing was going to stop easter from destroying jacob unless god has intervened in jacob's life praise the lord now what makes this story interesting is dead two brought us from the same wound and when brother branham talks about how every revival produced twins it would take people that have hanged around this message to persecute this bride the people that are saying the most foul things about the message about the prophet were people that sat in the pew just like you are sitting sad honor a preacher listening to this very same message that you are listening to praise the lord i don't want to go into that tonight i'm just trying to give you give us some history here but that's why we are traveling let me introduce that to you praise the lord unless god intervened in the life of jacob it was the supernatural it was the angel of the lord that met jacob that night the influence that the angel had on jacob's life that's why softing easier because until jacob came and met easter isa was determined to destroy him jacob saying he's saying katos take it and go in the peace my brother esau told him i have i have cuddles on the hills i don't want your cattle i want the man jacob praise the lord and with everything we find that is happening around us we don't know when that hour will come upon us praise the lord but we see we see the message and the messenger being attacked on facebook and people are bored to say whatever they want to say and i was just talking to a a brother uh uh uh was that last night or the other uh just just few days ago then i was just telling him i said does that just the nature of man we always try to blame somebody for our failure praise the lord we want to blame brother branham why are we not living godly life brother branham should be responsible while we don't have the holy ghost when he have declared the counsel of god to us men are always with that uh brother branham says that's that's uh that's passing the ball that's that's that's the adamic falling nature they always want to blame somebody for their failure oh god let me realize if i don't get to that place to have like brother branham says uh uh uh the the the he says uh the dynamics of this church will be the refilling of the holy ghost for this church to go right into her revival for this bride to go right into that spoken word revival we will need the dynamics we have the mechanics we have it on our phone we have an ipad we play it all night but we will need that quickening power to come from on the tape to come from on the box and quicken our lives if you don't have it it's your own fault praise the lord if you don't have the holy ghost it's your own fault the better you start you start looking at yourself now the better it is for you to get closer to god for the violence against the brothers jacob shame shall cover thee and thou shall be cut off so we see here if you go back there in verse three esau was very proud we see with the the the bitterness and the hatred that he has he he got again he he gained people when he spread four romans all around jacob has told him a blessing and i mean and he just he just he just polluted people's minds to hit jacob the same way he hit jacob he created a confederacy and he was violence against his brother jacob you think about it they came from the same womb praise the lord the mystery of the first tweens is different from the mystery of the second tweens the first twins they came from the same womb but from two different life two different father praise the lord amen we talk about that i don't want to repeat myself here because somebody quit to get out of track here and that's what we see here he had a violence against his brother jacob listen to this now verse 11 in the day that thou stood on the other side in the day that the strangers carried away captive his force psalm 100 and 37 that's why ob diary is referring to yeah praise the lord in a day that thou stood on the other side in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lot upon jerusalem even thou waste was one of them but thou should not have looked on thy brother in the day that he became a stranger praise the lord now when you go back to the sound that we have just read let's go back to psalm 137 like i said it's just a prayer meeting tonight we just want to read our bible amen psalm 137 let's go back there we will do the preaching on sunday but let's let's just read the scripture tonight and then we trust the lord to to put something on our heart to preach on sunday okay 37 look at the uh verse seven david out of inspiration he picks this up or the psalmist let me say because david is not one that wrote all the psalm anyway remember oh lord the children of edom in the day of jerusalem who said raise it raise it even to the foundation day of this is a prophecy if you go back instead of this is in history how the children of edom when when when nebuchadnezzar came babylon came and took over jerusalem the psalmist just did not say this to create a scene but that was the attitude of the people that was the attitude of the children of edom they were saying leave no stone untouched leave no stone untouched even to the foundation thereof raise it rig everything destroy everything now in the book of obedience obedience in his vision is seeing edom on the other side looking at his brother being carried into cutting and doing nothing about it doing nothing about it the scriptures say he that know to do good and doing that is sin brother branham said that is the worst thing that you can do to do nothing praise the lord let's read the prophet a little bit making valley full of dishes he says that that's the trouble of it it's more seen not to do than it is to do when you know better it's more seen not to do the attitude of it does not concern me praise the lord he said it's more seen not to do than it is to do when you know better that's right he that knoweth to do good and does it now to him it's sin you got to make ready doing nothing is the worst thing you can do praise the lord amen doing nothing even with this whole covey situation you are not a doctor you are not a scientist but you are a christian you are a christian you can pray you have a god that can answer prayer so you can contribute to help this the corvette situation if you just take a time to pray but brandon says the worst thing you can do doing nothing is the worst thing you can do do nothing about it it's on what you are doing then it is what you are failing to do praise the lord you see generational conflict something that just happened when they were just little boys in the house of their parents when they were not even married has now spread out to nations you see all of those nations around israel that don't want the peace of israel want to whip them out of the map it comes back to this prophecy praise the lord i give you the example of joseph and his brothers he was the one that was taken away his brother sold him his i mean it was not like edom eden was not the one that was coming against israel joseph brother saw him and it's still right there dividing the money of his price while the chair took him away but you see he never talked what happened to him as as ugly as he was as as as heartbroken as he was as disappointed as he was in his brother his question was why they did this why they did this now you have to remember now these are the same boys that raid a whole nation when the temple with their sister the uh diner they raided a whole city kill all the men in the city so perhaps joseph is thinking in his mind these guys are throwing the praying on me maybe they will come after this man and beat them but you see he could not understand it and he did not put no reason to it and because of that he could not get better he could not sow bitterness in his heart for all the years that he was away he was longing to see his brothers when he even had the opportunity to light them up give them some latches but he treated them with kindness because there was now one root of bitterness in his heart but easier because of proud that is in his heart you know what pride comes from it comes from that it comes from the attitude of entitlement when a child feels like they i mean they are entitled to this they don't they don't they don't regard it they just think they have a right they can they can take it they can do whatever they want to do with it praise the lord but that root of bitterness these two across the street i mean they couldn't they couldn't fight the babylonians but i mean they could do something they could even put their hands on their head and cry but that was not their attitude their attitude was web them out destroy everything that kind of attitude god never forget now you have to think about it this way brother branham said if you want to do something special for me he said do it for my children so it's a sense that's why jesus said anything spoken against the son of man will be forgiven he says but when the holy spirit come one word because the holy spirit will be in his children are we together say remember oh lord the children of edom in the day of jerusalem who said raise it raise it even to the foundation thereof now so obi daya picks that up in his vision describing that very sin in the day that thou stood on the other side in the day that the strangers carry and rebrand talks about that i i read that to you there you know he says he says as long as birth is in a man never give up on him but when we want to fail we say oh he have crossed the line he had crossed the line that that language of they have crossed the line is your personal attitude it's your attitude against the person you you i mean you are so angry with the person you don't want to help them no he has crossed the line the brother has crossed the line praise the lord let brother or sister misrepresent the truth we get better we get angry praise the lord when the lord said vengeance is mine i will repay why you want to play god in the day that thou stood on the other side in the day that the strangers carried a wake up to his forces and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lot upon jerusalem even the our world has one of them you even help them you throw stones now that gossip we are throwing they're not electrostones we put our owner coming in but there should not have looked on the day of that brother that he became a stranger god is saying you should have done some when you go to the book of deuteronomy you realize that god told israel god told israel he says do not pay back on edom what he has done to you because he is your brother he said even the egyptians because they house you you see the benefit of the ministry of a prophet just one vision it takes us back to genesis and carrying us all the way to the to the to the end of edom and uh in in in all and i mean we and we can go on and on god said thou should not have looked on the day of the brother in the day that he became a stranger neither should they have rejoice over the children of judah in their destruction a hurt god to his heart when you laugh at his children when you mock god's people and you throw hint in smart words it hurt god to his heart when you do that god never forgot that he never forgot the sin of edom neither should i have spoken proudly in the day of distress they all should not have entered into the gates of my people in the day of their calamity that's the very thing that is coming upon us that is the very thing that is coming upon us all the people that have been hanging around this message never had an experience with god talk about serpenty to put the affair oh it's a revelation revelation they don't have no experience with god their only knowledge about separate seed is it was not an outpatient sex it's all because their mind is dead the revelation of the serpent see is not sex sex is just the act it's not the revelation of the serpent see they want to use the message to show themselves smart but never want to come to a birth never want to come to a birth hang around this message preach for 40 years never came to a birth maybe that man appreciates message 40 years will be wearing shots in the street that's the hour that we are coming to with all the churches shut down people they can they can go to work and go to do their businesses you talk about church coronavirus you talk about church coronavirus no i mean i want to go there you know when people are singing you know the viruses that people are talking in there in walmart it sounds funny but that's where we are coming to that's what we are coming to you see the manifestation of the other twin that has hanged around this message they have gone to conventions they have they have preached they have sunk in the choir again they can tell you the year the paragraph number but yet there is no birth in them nine o'clock this is just a prayer meeting i'm not preaching please praise the lord verb said in uh we will see jesus he says but if somebody is trying to do something and yet making blunt and you are doing nothing then keep still then they just keep still they know how to sit down in their houses stream from this church and stream from that church praise the lord and look at those brothers of those people they don't even have church order they don't do this they don't do that and you write in your bedroom in your pajamas with no shirt on you and you believe that you have revelation brother brandon said trying to do something and yet the blonde is that not what isa i mean jacob was trying to do but it's not what he was trying to do is what was driving him to do it what he wanted he wanted the breath right he wanted the blessing and you doing nothing keep still of that thing they are getting so safe anyhow so what they are doing working against it i would i rather be found making a mistake i'd rather be found making a mistake you better go and take this from on tape praise the lord i already finished copying it in my notes so you can take it away i'm still going to keep this one then crying on the sideline criticizing those who are trying to do something anyhow the people that complain are the ones that are making no effort to approach god they complain and they blame everybody that that is that pastor that's what i don't go to that church this pastor that's what i know about him that's why i don't go to that church they have they have all the reason they are so justified in their mind but we coming to that place you will soon see the other twins that has been in the same room with you out of these years praise the lord so easter he was proud he had a confederacy he had violence against his brother he rejoice he rejoice in the falling of a brother a brother being carried away into conte he rejoice that should not have entered into the gates of my people in the days of their calamity here there she should have not have look upon their affliction in the days of their calamity none have lay hands on their substance he even looted from his brother he even stole things away praise the lord it was one of jesus's own church that said the one that our case he's the man praise the lord he brought him right into the meetings and said they're worthy of having service and let me see this tonight if you don't have the holy ghost nothing will stop you from doing that if you don't have the holy
