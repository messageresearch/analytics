[5:42] became a total failure to
[5:46] himself all that he knew all that he
[5:49] understood and everything he become a
[5:51] total failure it didn't work he was put
[5:54] under a
[5:55] situation to where that nobody would
[5:59] listen to when he was a prisoner amen
[6:02] see he was put into a
[6:05] situation that
[6:07] unbelievers would not
[6:11] believe his ministry was a not
[6:17] effect the people turn their
[6:20] head they wouldn't pay no attention to
[6:22] him in
[6:24] prison what good for his ministry do he
[6:27] must stand into the prison bars and
[6:29] preach have they walk on down the street
[6:31] see but he become a prisoner God kept
[6:35] him a prisoner until
[6:40] [Music]
[6:41] the Hallelujah all fa
[6:46] finally God came J in his prison like
[6:51] Paul like all that stuff he came to him
[6:55] and he used the gift that he had given
[6:57] him to get him out of there that's right
[7:01] he brought him from his
[7:03] prison what did he do as soon as he
[7:07] brought him from his prison he was given
[7:11] power amen by the king his King am that
[7:15] he show the side of that he was under he
[7:19] was brought from the prison house and
[7:21] given power to whatever he said had to
[7:25] happen
[7:27] amen amen
[7:30] in his prison he constantly remember he
[7:33] was born for a
[7:35] purpose he was going to set King and all
[7:39] the rest of us going to B to him his
[7:42] vision told him
[7:44] so but before his vision could be
[7:47] completely fulfilled he had become a
[7:49] prisoner amen and then become a
[7:53] ruler and when he come from his prison
[7:56] house and become a prisoner of the word
[8:00] of God that he can only say what God put
[8:02] in his mouth to
[8:04] say then God moved
[8:07] through Hallelujah that Moses had power
[8:11] to bind pharoh
[8:14] princes all will yes if you say to this
[8:18] mountain be mo
[8:20] Hallelujah you have power to bind
[8:23] Pharaoh's princes amen whether they were
[8:26] deacons or prors or whether
[8:29] St represent whatever you want I
[8:36] you this he can do it at his own word
[8:39] his own pleasure
[8:41] yes glory to God
[8:47] hallelujah oh I just got about three
[8:50] more minutes I keep my
[8:52] word
[8:53] now we find
[8:56] out that he he become a pris pron ER to
[8:59] God from a prisoner to the world from
[9:02] Paul the same way and Moses the same way
[9:05] from a prisoner to his own thinking to
[9:08] pron to God and when he come out he had
[9:11] the power of God and when he become PA
[9:14] when the own thinking of Moses he was
[9:17] surrendered it and stripped of it he
[9:19] become a prisoner to Christ's word could
[9:22] only move where ever you say Christ he
[9:24] estain the reproach of Christ greater
[9:26] Treasures than that of Egypt so he
[9:28] wasn't prison Christ just like Paul was
[9:31] remember all three of them were
[9:34] prophets yeah see and they had to be
[9:38] stck of their own thinking and order to
[9:40] become a prisoner to the will and the
[9:42] ways of God now we remember now that he
[9:47] had power to bind at his own word he had
[9:50] power to loose at his own word he could
[9:53] say I loose
[9:55] you in the name of my king amen
[10:00] amen
[10:02] hallelujah Pharaoh made Joseph his
[10:07] son
[10:09] Christ Mak his prisoners of love his
[10:14] sons amen and he gives him
[10:17] power the same thing he St John 142 he
[10:22] that believeth on me see the works that
[10:25] I do shall he do also even more than
[10:28] this shall he do
[10:31] now the prisoner of the love of Christ
[10:34] becomes empowered by his King who is
[10:36] Christ amen and ver I say unto you if
[10:40] you say to this mountain be moved and
[10:42] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[10:43] that what you said will come to pass you
[10:45] have what you said amen if you abide me
[10:48] in my word and you if you're Yol to me
[10:50] because him and his words are same in
[10:51] the beginning watch word words with God
[10:53] the word made blessed same yesterday and
[10:55] forever if he abide me nothing here and
[10:58] there abide me in my word and you ask
[11:01] what you will or say what you will
[11:06] amen he had power Lord notice before he
[11:09] come out he had to be taken out and
[11:13] shave a few things had to be shaved off
[11:16] before he can meet his
[11:18] King oh God sometimes paes people out
[11:21] like that and shaves a few of their own
[11:24] Wills
[11:25] off CH them that they can't do this what
[11:27] they wanted to do you know what I mean
[11:30] amen they're not they're not Liberty to
[11:31] do what they want to do before they can
[11:34] come into full power and be a l slave to
[11:37] Christ they have to be shaved off and
[11:39] then
[11:40] presented sometimes he take them to the
[11:42] desert to do that to shave them off and
[11:46] then bring them out the anointed one to
[11:48] fulfill the purpose that he's ordained
[11:51] them to be Hallelujah see what I mean
[11:54] Brothers we're at the end time remember
[11:58] all other time mind what he's done he's
[12:01] always had to take a man and make him a
[12:02] prisoner to him forsake his
[12:05] own he had to forsake everything that he
[12:08] know forget all his trainings and
[12:10] everything in order to know the will of
[12:13] God and to follow God he can't follow
[12:15] anything that man's got to do and God at
[12:17] the same time it's too contrary one to
[12:19] another you can't be going east and west
[12:21] at the same time you can't be going uh
[12:23] right and left at the same time you
[12:24] can't be doing right and wrong at the
[12:26] same time you can't be following man and
[12:27] God at the same time no sir you either
[12:30] following God or following
[12:32] man now then if you are following God
[12:35] and have submitted yourself to God then
[12:39] you become a prisoner to that God to
[12:42] that word to that will no matter what
[12:44] anything else is you become a a prisoner
[12:46] to it listen we're at the end
[12:51] time and I would say this with reverence
[12:54] and respect as the last couple minutes
[12:56] is floating by look
[12:59] amen what God to my opinion will do and
[13:04] must do and will do and this last day is
[13:08] to find the tool for the
[13:10] harest he's got to find a tool to th the
[13:15] Flor any farmer when he goes to his
[13:18] Harvest he has to have a tool to do it
[13:21] with he's got to have a sharp sickle or
[13:24] something some instrument to thrash out
[13:27] the grain and the Harvest is
[13:30] life God take us in your
[13:34] hand make us bonder Servants of your
[13:37] love and use this for tools to bring the
[13:41] realization to this sinful cursed Earth
[13:43] that we're living in today that Jesus
[13:45] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[13:47] forever for myself God let me be a
[13:51] prisoner if all my brethren turn me down
[13:54] if all my friends turn me down I want to
[13:56] be a prisoner of Jesus Christ in his
[13:59] word that I might be harnessed to his
[14:01] word by the Holy Spirit to see the Holy
[14:05] Spirit make the word of God be confirmed
[14:07] by the same things that he said would be
[14:09] done I want to be a prisoner of Jesus
[14:11] Christ let us
[14:16] pray I wonder tonight with our heads
[14:18] bound if that
[14:22] ambition that we have of being something
[14:24] else or maybe of of something that we
[14:28] might think be a selfish thing wonder if
