[38:58] i thought we were in church but he
[38:59] brought us to the tabernacle
[39:03] amen after we got to church he took us
[39:05] to the tabernacle
[39:07] but it's going to be in the house of the
[39:08] lord let's take the by our bibles
[39:10] tonight
[39:11] amen thank you musicians
[39:15] praise the lord that should be first
[39:16] corinthians chapter three
[39:20] that should be first corinthians chapter
[39:21] three tonight
[39:26] we'll rehearse a little bit the last
[39:29] convenience service we use uh
[39:31] uh we
[39:33] already structured and went over
[39:35] a little bit of this
[39:38] now you have to remember now from the
[39:39] beginning of the year we we started with
[39:42] crossing over into our inheritance
[39:45] you know crossing over jordan
[39:48] into our inheritance
[39:50] and uh and then since then we've been
[39:52] speaking on
[39:54] rewards and
[39:57] i want to be like that evangelist that
[40:00] brother branham talks about
[40:03] and when they ask him you don't you have
[40:05] no other message beside repentance he
[40:07] said well
[40:09] unless the people
[40:11] repent
[40:13] unless we see repentance we're not going
[40:15] to stop amen
[40:17] so unless we get a hold of our reward
[40:20] our inheritance then we might stay on
[40:22] this
[40:23] praise the lord
[40:25] but
[40:26] i'm just trying to trust in the law to
[40:28] be able to use this
[40:30] and
[40:34] just
[40:35] just to to help us to realize that you
[40:39] have to remember now
[40:41] that salvation
[40:43] is a gift
[40:44] it's a free gift
[40:46] nothing you have to do
[40:48] you just have to accept it
[40:51] it's a free gift
[40:53] praise the lord
[40:54] if you accept the lord jesus christ and
[40:56] what he have done for you on the cross
[40:59] of calvary
[41:00] and accept god's free gift of salvation
[41:04] is a free gift but when it comes to
[41:07] reward
[41:09] is is completely different
[41:12] we will see some few things tonight
[41:14] is completely different
[41:16] um
[41:18] [Music]
[41:20] to each of the church ages there was a
[41:22] reward that was given to them
[41:25] there was a reward that was given to
[41:27] them
[41:28] and because of uh
[41:31] how can i overcome brother branham
[41:33] express a little bit of that because
[41:36] of the age that we are dealing with this
[41:39] evil age and the spirit that are in this
[41:42] age that have come from all the ages
[41:45] god has rewarded this age
[41:48] or promised to reward this age that he
[41:51] that overcome will sit with me
[41:54] which means
[41:56] god
[41:57] we have a reward to have a domain
[42:01] to come to a place of rest
[42:04] praise the lord
[42:06] like none of the ages has come to
[42:10] and the thing that is bringing us to
[42:12] rest
[42:13] is how much god has revealed himself
[42:16] through his word
[42:17] to us in this age
[42:19] if we can just take the word and apply
[42:22] the word to
[42:23] every situation
[42:25] we will definitely find rest
[42:29] praise the lord
[42:30] so to every age
[42:32] you find that even uh
[42:35] well let me not keep you standing
[42:38] let me not keep you standing
[42:42] praise the lord that's first corinthians
[42:44] chapter three let's let's take our our
[42:47] bibles here
[42:49] and
[43:01] let me let me just let me just get get a
[43:03] little background here so you will see
[43:05] it will help us to be able to see let's
[43:06] read from verse one and our brethren
[43:09] could now speak unto you as unto
[43:13] spiritual
[43:14] but as onto khanna am i reading from
[43:17] first corinthians chapter three one
[43:19] okay
[43:20] okay most of the time i'm
[43:23] out
[43:25] i could not speak unto you as unto
[43:27] spirituals but unto canon even as unto
[43:31] babes
[43:33] in christ
[43:37] i have failed you with
[43:38] milk and not with meat for heather told
[43:42] you were not able to bury it
[43:45] neither yet now
[43:48] i
[43:49] need iea evil
[43:52] okay let's go ahead
[43:55] four-year ayet khanna for whereas there
[43:58] is among you envy strive divisions
[44:03] i in that cannon and walk
[44:05] as
[44:06] men for why i won't say i'm of apollos
[44:10] and another i'm of paul and another sign
[44:12] of apollos i ain't not connor
[44:15] who then is poor
[44:18] and who is apollos
[44:20] but ministers by whom you believe even
[44:23] as the lord
[44:25] gave
[44:26] to every man i have planted
[44:28] apollo water
[44:30] but god
[44:32] god is the one that gave
[44:34] increase so then neither is he that
[44:38] planted anything
[44:41] neither he that preached the word is
[44:43] anything
[44:46] amen
[44:49] neither he that water it
[44:51] but god that is able to go down there
[44:54] and cause that seed to dramatize
[44:58] god that is able to bring the world to
[45:00] pass in your life
[45:05] it's not whether he can preach mystery
[45:07] or i like the way he can preach they
[45:09] have nothing to do with it
[45:13] is the result of the seed
[45:16] is the quickening of the seed
[45:18] he is the one that quickens the seed and
[45:21] until he quickens it
[45:24] it's going to lie in the earth and it
[45:25] will it will just be the dormant all
[45:27] dead
[45:30] but it's god that quickened he gave the
[45:33] increase now so see see where the
[45:35] apostle paul is coming with this with
[45:37] this conversation
[45:40] now he that planted and he that water it
[45:43] i won
[45:45] and every man shall receive
[45:48] his own
[45:49] reward
[45:51] and we've been talking about reward now
[45:54] i want i want i'm trusting that the law
[45:56] will bring us
[45:57] bring us to a place where we will
[45:59] realize how much this is important
[46:02] do you know how many christians
[46:05] people
[46:06] that believe even around the message
[46:09] all they think about is just going in
[46:11] the rapture
[46:15] and do you know
[46:17] that
[46:18] the ones that will not taste death
[46:21] is also a reward
[46:25] it's not for everybody
[46:31] it's not for everybody
[46:34] we get we'll get into there we trust
[46:36] that the lord will help us here so paul
[46:38] here is bringing us to the place
[46:40] and the one that planted the one that
[46:42] watered god bless you have you seen
[46:45] as we continue to read every man shall
[46:48] receive his own reward
[46:51] by calling to his own
[46:53] labor
[46:56] amen
[46:58] for we
[46:59] for for we are laborers together with
[47:03] god
[47:05] ye are god husbandry
[47:08] yeah god's building a calling to the
[47:10] grace of god which is giving unto me
[47:15] as a wise master builder
[47:18] i have laid the foundation
[47:22] and another build it there on
[47:26] but let every man take he
[47:29] how he built their own
[47:33] for all the foundation can no man lay
[47:37] no main lane that's the reason why it do
[47:41] not benefit us
[47:42] to establish ourselves in the hearts of
[47:45] the people
[47:47] it do not benefit us
[47:49] because you cannot lay any other
[47:52] foundation that is already jesus christ
[47:55] is the chief cornerstone
[48:00] anything contrary to that is not going
[48:02] to stand i don't care how i try to
[48:05] impress you or is not going to stand
[48:08] it might be sustainable for a while
[48:11] god will cause something to happen
[48:17] he will cause something to happen
[48:20] just so he can get the man out of the
[48:23] way
[48:26] and that's the that's the reason why
[48:28] many earnest man has come to the place
[48:31] that the various people that raise him
[48:33] up
[48:34] are the same people that turn around and
[48:36] despise him
[48:43] there is no other foundation
[48:46] can no man lay that is laid which is
[48:49] jesus christ
[48:51] now if any man build
[48:54] upon this foundation
[48:57] gold
[48:58] savor
[49:00] precious stones three
[49:03] natural elements three god-given
[49:06] elements
[49:08] praise the lord
[49:10] now see now paul from the very beginning
[49:13] he starts saying that
[49:15] we are just
[49:17] work it is god that does the increase
[49:21] now so he's bringing three god-given
[49:24] elements
[49:25] gold saver and precious stone that is
[49:28] given by god then he's taking three
[49:32] also that man can produce wood hill
[49:36] and
[49:38] and stable
[49:40] a man had to cut a living tree down to
[49:42] make a wood out of faith he has to you
[49:44] know gather the the
[49:46] the herbs and out of there to make a
[49:47] hell out of faith and all of that so
[49:50] three are men men
[49:52] and three
[49:53] are god-given
[49:55] six
[49:56] is the number of men
[50:00] so paul takes six elements that
[50:03] represent man and man is caught right in
[50:07] between there where he has the grace of
[50:09] god on one side and he also have his
[50:13] human element
[50:17] he can either
[50:19] fall on the side of the grace of god or
[50:23] he can use strain energy bill his name
[50:27] whatever it is just is just human
[50:29] element
[50:31] are we together
[50:35] every man work
[50:38] shall be may manifest
[50:40] for the day shall declare it
[50:43] because
[50:45] it shall be revealed by fire now most
[50:49] people think about this and they think
[50:51] about hell fire no that's not hell fire
[50:58] it's not hellfire you have to remember
[50:59] our god is a consuming fire
[51:05] this is not hellfire paul is now talking
[51:08] about hell fire yet he's trying to bring
[51:11] now see the position of the corinthian
[51:13] church
[51:14] right at the beginning
[51:16] of the book paul praised these people
[51:19] how is known that the gifts are among
[51:22] you spiritual gifts i am on you but yet
[51:26] you are connor
[51:32] are we together
[51:34] amen we can say the same thing about us
[51:38] we we we we have been given the gift of
[51:41] god in this age the message of the hour
[51:43] the greatest move of god on earth
[51:46] but yet there is a lot of canality
[51:51] with us
[51:52] because we have taken attack and think
[51:54] that we are better than other people
[51:57] and we just take a name
[52:05] every man work
[52:07] shall be revealed by fire
[52:10] and the fire shall try
[52:13] every
[52:15] work
[52:18] of what sought it is
[52:22] if any man's work abide
[52:25] which he has built there on
[52:27] he shall receive a reward
[52:31] now you put fire on gold
[52:34] gold is going to stay
[52:37] you put fire on savor silver is going to
[52:40] stay
[52:42] you put fire on precious stones it's
[52:45] just going to be more precious
[52:50] i put fire on wood this house is going
[52:52] to burn down
[52:54] please don't try it
[52:57] amen
[52:59] is there any sound out there becomes
[53:01] that no fire in here
[53:11] think about when god came down and
[53:14] and uh and visited manoa and his wife
[53:19] and after the brawl the sacrifice you
[53:22] know uh saw this man the angel of the
[53:24] lord
[53:25] and uh and abroad you know sacrifice and
[53:28] food and whatever
[53:30] and god came down in the form
[53:33] you know
[53:34] of of a fire
[53:36] you know and and consumed the sacrifice
[53:40] and and and right in the midst of that
[53:42] the angel of the lord you know
[53:45] and uh
[53:46] uh
[53:47] manoa and his wife said we have seen the
[53:49] lord
[53:54] so that is the way
[53:58] that god is dealing with us i'm trying
[54:00] to
[54:00] to trust the law to find a way to to go
[54:03] about this now if any man works about he
[54:06] he uh
[54:07] which he have built there on he shall
[54:09] receive a reward
[54:11] but i'm not bad if any man's work shall
[54:15] be burned
[54:17] he shall suffer loss brother branham
[54:20] says there are many that will be
[54:22] disappointed he shall suffer lust he
[54:25] shall suffer regret
[54:28] but he himself shall be saved the
[54:31] salvation is already there
[54:33] because the salvation is a finished work
[54:43] praise the lord
[54:46] but he's going to suffer lust he's going
[54:48] to be disappointed
[54:55] are we together
[55:01] but he himself shall be saved
[55:03] yet so by fire
[55:06] amen
[55:07] which is
[55:09] the baptising of the holy ghost
[55:11] now see how paul is going to move this
[55:14] now it's good for us to read our bible
[55:17] knowing that that ye are the temple of
[55:21] god
[55:23] and that the spirit of god dwelleth
[55:26] in you
[55:29] if any man
[55:31] defy the temple of god him shall god
[55:35] destroy
[55:36] for the temple
[55:38] of god is holy
[55:41] which temple
[55:43] ye ah
[55:44] you know what i'm trusting the lord
[55:47] i'm trusting the law that
[55:49] this subject will bring us to such
[55:52] a dedication
[55:55] amen
[55:56] it will bring us to a place of
[55:58] dedication
[56:00] that just like how solomon dedicated the
[56:04] temple
[56:05] and the presence of god came down
[56:08] we will begin to dedicate our body
[56:11] to be able to experience the presence of
[56:14] god in our body
[56:16] praise the lord
[56:18] now let's go back let's take solomon
[56:21] temple
[56:22] see the history of the temple
[56:26] the temple that was built
[56:31] just look at the history
[56:36] the temple was built
[56:40] or the temple came true
[56:43] an act
[56:45] of
[56:47] adultery
[56:53] david
[56:55] and bert sheba
[56:57] an adam for adultery a murder a
[57:00] murder was committed
[57:04] uris died
[57:12] then solomon that built the temple went
[57:15] into
[57:16] idolatry
[57:20] but yet out of that
[57:23] god was able to raise up a temple
[57:29] amen
[57:31] he was able to raise our race of a
[57:34] temple
[57:36] and because of the way it was neatly
[57:40] joined together and the order that was
[57:42] in it
[57:43] he felt so pleased
[57:47] that since the day of moses
[57:50] amen
[57:51] when the people saw the the presence of
[57:55] god on the mountain the lightning the
[57:57] fire and all of that
[57:59] since that time god
[58:03] has not been so visible to his people to
[58:06] come in the congregation of israel
[58:12] but just imagine that god was able to
[58:15] raise up a temple
[58:18] from murder from a state of a man that
[58:20] killed a man for his wife
[58:22] idolatry and lies and and and and
[58:26] and all of that
[58:30] that's the temple we are
[58:34] that's the temple you and myself are
[58:39] god is building
[58:42] a living monument
[58:45] from the robbers of sin
[58:47] lies
[58:52] they have run down in our family in
[58:54] generation
[58:55] but yet he's going to raise up a temple
[58:59] where he's going to be two feet on the
[59:01] earth
[59:02] he's going to get a man a body would not
[59:05] prepare me
[59:17] praise the lord
[59:19] now he says he moved right from reward
[59:24] and then he jumped to
[59:27] you your body
[59:29] don't you know
[59:30] that your body now why the paul did that
[59:35] why he did that
[59:37] is to bring some sense
[59:39] of consciousness
[59:41] to us
[59:42] first corinthians chapter five let's go
[59:44] to verse chapter 5.
[1:00:09] praise the lord
[1:00:11] now in chapter 5 that's where he did
[1:00:14] with the
[1:00:15] with the living
[1:00:17] let me let me let me keep myself
[1:00:19] together a year before
[1:00:21] uh
[1:00:22] i just throw things apart
[1:00:25] and uh okay
[1:00:26] second corinthians chapter five that's
[1:00:28] where i wanted to go
[1:00:32] we get to our subject tonight
[1:00:34] i'm
[1:00:35] just trying to
[1:00:36] to lay a foundation
[1:00:44] second corinthians chapter five
[1:00:50] now verse nine let's take verse nine
[1:00:55] verse 9 wherefore we liber now you're
[1:00:58] talking about the same label
[1:01:01] that whether present or absent
[1:01:04] we may be
[1:01:07] accepted of him
[1:01:10] amen
[1:01:12] that word i i just located this this
[1:01:14] evening pleasing
[1:01:17] that word accepted means to be pleasing
[1:01:21] amen that god will be pleased
[1:01:25] with us
[1:01:28] praise the lord
[1:01:30] now that there was you know like people
[1:01:33] would say king broad
[1:01:34] rotting apple and rotting tomatoes
[1:01:38] that's that's that's a lie
[1:01:41] he brought the first fruit
[1:01:44] of his harvest
[1:01:47] amen amen
[1:01:49] he brought the first fruit of his
[1:01:51] harvest
[1:01:55] but yet god was not pleased
[1:02:02] amen
[1:02:05] because
[1:02:06] it is it's from the same channel now
[1:02:08] it's it was all from his work
[1:02:15] it was all from his labor his effort
[1:02:22] but king by evil sacrifice
[1:02:25] was from a thought
[1:02:27] within
[1:02:34] abel's sacrifice came from something
[1:02:37] within his heart
[1:02:40] by faith
[1:02:42] abel offered
[1:02:44] a more excellent sacrifice
[1:02:48] so his sacrifice were pleasing to god
[1:02:52] because it was something that came from
[1:02:54] his heart
[1:02:55] not from his hands
[1:03:01] are we together
[1:03:03] just follow me now
[1:03:05] wherefore we labor
[1:03:07] that whether present or absent
[1:03:10] we may be accepted of him
[1:03:14] for we must all
[1:03:17] we must all appear before the judgment
[1:03:21] seat
[1:03:23] of christ
[1:03:25] now this scripture also throw people off
[1:03:28] many believers says no this is not for
[1:03:31] us
[1:03:32] because then they are believing christ
[1:03:34] has passed from death onto life there is
[1:03:37] no condemnation no judgment but this is
[1:03:41] the the the word used here is completely
[1:03:44] different from the white throne judgment
[1:03:47] followed let's let's follow now let's
[1:03:49] follow the thought of what the holy
[1:03:50] spirit is ministering to us here for we
[1:03:53] must all appear before the judgment seat
[1:03:56] of christ that everyone may receive
[1:04:01] the things done in his what
[1:04:05] body
[1:04:08] body
[1:04:09] now connected back to first corinthians
[1:04:13] 3 your body is the temple
[1:04:17] your body is the temple
[1:04:20] what was god's purpose
[1:04:22] to make man in his image
[1:04:25] that was a spirit man and god would come
[1:04:28] down and take the dust of the earth and
[1:04:31] and build a body what was the purpose of
[1:04:34] that
[1:04:38] it was not for all that we think it is
[1:04:42] amen
[1:04:43] it was not for us to you know why i i i
[1:04:47] i i i don't know how to call it now
[1:04:51] it was not for us to uh do whatever you
[1:04:54] know like you know make ourselves uh
[1:04:56] pretty handsome you know we're not
[1:04:58] supposed to be like rascal in a way
[1:05:00] we're not supposed to be uh you know
[1:05:02] you're supposed to have a presentation
[1:05:04] that when someone see you and you tell
[1:05:06] them you are a christian they say i know
[1:05:07] you were because there was something the
[1:05:09] way you present yourself you look like a
[1:05:11] gentleman you look like a young decent
[1:05:13] woman that's the way we're supposed to
[1:05:14] be but the purpose of god god had a
[1:05:17] purpose
[1:05:19] to make a body
[1:05:23] he had a purpose
[1:05:25] the purpose was for his expression
[1:05:30] paul says we are made for his purpose
[1:05:32] for his pleasure
[1:05:34] for god to express himself so this body
[1:05:38] is given to us
[1:05:39] and what we do in this body
[1:05:42] we will
[1:05:44] be rewarded for it
[1:05:53] what we do in this body
[1:05:55] we will be rewarded for it
[1:05:59] when god gave you a trial in this body
[1:06:02] and you are able to rightly carry that
[1:06:04] trial out not looking for who to blame
[1:06:07] and who to will to cast it on but you
[1:06:09] are able to say beard unto me now
[1:06:12] calling to your word lord i don't
[1:06:14] understand it but i know you are in this
[1:06:16] i know you're using this to build
[1:06:18] character in me
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:23] you will be rewarded for that job was
[1:06:25] rewarded
[1:06:27] he never did anything to be sick
[1:06:31] but god was using him as a testimony to
[1:06:34] a lying devil
[1:06:38] that there is a man born of woman
[1:06:41] that can be able to stand for god on the
[1:06:43] earth
[1:06:45] so every man
[1:06:47] we give account
[1:06:49] of what you allowed to happen in this
[1:06:53] body
[1:07:00] sometimes we become
[1:07:02] you know
[1:07:03] we we
[1:07:04] the church must be a sacred place
[1:07:08] but you see people put a lot of
[1:07:09] sacredness on this building
[1:07:11] and they forget about this one they can
[1:07:14] abuse their body
[1:07:16] with thoughts and things
[1:07:19] and then when they come to church
[1:07:35] i refer to danny henry in prophecy over
[1:07:37] brother branham
[1:07:39] what was that
[1:07:41] the choice
[1:07:43] that he made
[1:07:44] the difficult path
[1:07:46] that he choose
[1:07:49] the prophecy was a huge portion of
[1:07:51] heaven
[1:07:52] and whistling
[1:07:54] because of the choice that you make
[1:07:59] his choice that he made to stay with the
[1:08:01] word of god
[1:08:03] not to join no denomination stay even if
[1:08:05] he's rejected
[1:08:11] wealth
[1:08:29] for we must all appear before
[1:08:33] the joshua seat
[1:08:36] this joshua seat
[1:08:41] is just like
[1:08:43] jesus before pilot
[1:08:49] it's called the beamer seat
[1:08:52] it's a seat
[1:08:53] of
[1:08:54] you know where people are are rewarded
[1:08:57] what a good or bad they are they are
[1:08:59] giving the reward
[1:09:01] it's just that the term
[1:09:03] joshua seat
[1:09:05] make many to think that is the white
[1:09:07] trunk judgment no
[1:09:20] we must all
[1:09:22] appear
[1:09:24] before the judgment seat of christ that
[1:09:26] everyone may receive
[1:09:29] the things done
[1:09:31] in his body according to that
[1:09:35] he have done
[1:09:37] whether it be good or bad
[1:09:40] the thing that he have done in his body
[1:09:46] knowing net
[1:09:48] that your body
[1:09:50] is the temple of god
[1:09:56] the thing that we have done in our body
[1:10:02] praise the lord
[1:10:04] i pray that the lord will help us
[1:10:05] tonight
[1:10:08] let's just read something here and then
[1:10:10] we can we can be able to start up
[1:10:14] are we together
[1:10:19] let's read a dream from the sixth heal
[1:10:27] but branham say our dream about a month
[1:10:31] after that i was i was standing one day
[1:10:34] and i was watching the great time
[1:10:37] now
[1:10:40] not not the judgment now
[1:10:42] not the judgment i don't believe the
[1:10:45] church ever comes to death i mean the
[1:10:48] bride goes
[1:10:51] to a judgment
[1:10:54] you see you see what he's trying to
[1:10:56] place here
[1:10:57] amen so i don't believe that you know
[1:11:01] but
[1:11:02] i was there
[1:11:04] when the crowns
[1:11:07] was being given out
[1:11:11] so the whole thing about these crowns
[1:11:13] that we are talking about
[1:11:15] is rewards
[1:11:21] praise the lord
[1:11:26] see
[1:11:28] great big throne set up here and jesus
[1:11:33] and the recording angel
[1:11:36] and all was standing there and there was
[1:11:40] a
[1:11:41] stir step
[1:11:43] like coming down this way
[1:11:46] of white ivory run down in the cycle
[1:11:51] praise the
[1:11:52] lord and i was standing back way back
[1:11:57] on one side and i was just standing
[1:11:59] there
[1:12:02] never an idea i had to walk them steps
[1:12:09] i was standing there
[1:12:11] and i did see
[1:12:12] a recording angel who called a setting
[1:12:15] name
[1:12:18] and ah i recognized that name
[1:12:21] i looked
[1:12:22] and way back there here come the brother
[1:12:25] walking or the sister walking
[1:12:28] up here like that recording injured
[1:12:32] now you see
[1:12:34] the the thing of head there it is the
[1:12:36] other
[1:12:44] there there there are a lot of these
[1:12:45] things they are the you know the dreams
[1:12:47] and and the visions you know the trains
[1:12:50] of brother branham
[1:12:52] you know that that the lord
[1:12:54] allowed him to experience
[1:12:57] but you see uh
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:13:02] sometimes
[1:13:04] these things happen
[1:13:07] to to a believer it happened to a man
[1:13:12] you know uh
[1:13:17] just like brother branham talks about
[1:13:19] that uh
[1:13:20] uh 42-inch
[1:13:23] boat that he was going to kill
[1:13:25] and and the bed that he was going to
[1:13:27] shadow so and all of that
[1:13:30] and
[1:13:33] and he had that
[1:13:36] and he went out there
[1:13:38] you know and
[1:13:39] you know
[1:13:40] and he got the animal and he talked
[1:13:43] about the man with the checkabout shirt
[1:13:45] turned out to be brother l biscuit and
[1:13:47] all of that
[1:13:49] and brother branham kept asking the lord
[1:13:53] uh what was the meaning of this
[1:13:56] you know what what was the meaning
[1:13:59] why he had this dream and god never told
[1:14:02] him what it meant
[1:14:03] now you see the thing there is that it
[1:14:05] was not just about
[1:14:08] uh having a dream and a coming to pass
[1:14:12] but god had a purpose
[1:14:16] and the the only reason because behind
[1:14:20] the that dream about the bulldog out of
[1:14:23] that the reason behind it is that
[1:14:26] brother branham was going to loss
[1:14:29] one of the closest person in his life
[1:14:32] his mother
[1:14:35] he was the first child
[1:14:39] he saw how his mother suffered
[1:14:43] they had to move from time to time and
[1:14:45] things that she have to do verbatim
[1:14:47] talks about how he will go and hunt
[1:14:50] and his mom would just take the you know
[1:14:52] the the stomach of the the animal in
[1:14:55] little pot to faithful for them and
[1:14:57] prepare the rest for him to go and sell
[1:14:59] just to be able
[1:15:04] and
[1:15:06] she was very close to him
[1:15:11] he was not close to his dad because his
[1:15:13] dad talked that you know he was you you
[1:15:15] know he was different he was successful
[1:15:17] he would not drink you he was not a real
[1:15:19] branham
[1:15:21] but he saw his mother
[1:15:25] bringing all of those children
[1:15:27] in all the things
[1:15:30] that she went through
[1:15:32] and his mother was going to pass
[1:15:36] and god was not going to give him a
[1:15:38] vision or a dream god was not going to
[1:15:41] tell brother branham that his mom was
[1:15:43] going to pass
[1:15:46] because it's some of the things
[1:15:48] that is just hard to bear
[1:15:53] brother branham lost his wife and his
[1:15:55] baby he almost blew his own head off he
[1:15:58] held
[1:15:59] an electric cable he said if he was not
[1:16:01] god i was going to be i was going to fry
[1:16:04] to death
[1:16:07] and because that was going to happen
[1:16:12] god gave him a dream
[1:16:16] a vision
[1:16:18] about the bull with the exact horn
[1:16:22] exact measurement
[1:16:24] that god will show him the exact
[1:16:26] measurement
[1:16:28] of the horn
[1:16:31] god told him about the bed god told him
[1:16:34] about a a boy that had a checkable shirt
[1:16:38] and to brother branham what a dream is
[1:16:40] this
[1:16:44] and it was not just a dream
[1:16:46] like
[1:16:47] like any ordinary dream
[1:16:51] because
[1:16:52] god stamped that dream with his seal
[1:16:56] that thou said the lord
[1:16:58] you will not just shoot a boat but you
[1:17:01] will shoot a board with this exact
[1:17:03] measurement now one inch less
[1:17:06] now one inch longer
[1:17:10] now so god will do those things
[1:17:17] and the reason
[1:17:19] was to be able to comfort his prophet
[1:17:23] that i will never leave you
[1:17:26] i will never forsake you
[1:17:32] just another way to say i will never
[1:17:34] leave you
[1:17:35] i will never forsake you
[1:17:39] when brother brandon mother
[1:17:41] was passing he did not believe it
[1:17:44] he never believed that his mother was
[1:17:45] going to die because he said the lord
[1:17:47] never told me
[1:17:50] he was preaching the message the
[1:17:51] comforter
[1:17:53] when he called him
[1:17:57] it was right on the pulpit preaching
[1:17:58] when his mom passed
[1:18:01] right after the service he had to run to
[1:18:03] the hospital
[1:18:06] mama was gone
[1:18:08] and brother branham now started asking
[1:18:10] god
[1:18:11] lord why you never told me
[1:18:15] you told me about other people
[1:18:18] why you never told me
[1:18:20] then god reminded him you remember
[1:18:24] the vision i gave you about that board
[1:18:27] about that bed
[1:18:28] it was for this particular moment
[1:18:35] children we are serving
[1:18:38] a god
[1:18:40] that created the heaven and the earth
[1:18:44] praise the lord
[1:18:47] you can be smarter than god
[1:18:51] praise the lord
[1:18:56] i heard somebody say god says
[1:18:59] come walk with me
[1:19:00] just like he told the prophet
[1:19:05] praise the lord
[1:19:06] he told his disciple follow me
[1:19:10] but
[1:19:12] he just don't want us to be behind
[1:19:14] because we could last
[1:19:18] he want us to be by his side
[1:19:23] he don't want us to be ahead of him
[1:19:24] either
[1:19:27] he don't want you to be behind him
[1:19:30] he wants you to walk
[1:19:32] with him
[1:19:42] now so your brother band is having
[1:19:43] another dream
[1:19:45] remember brother branham
[1:19:47] visit behind the curtain of time it came
[1:19:50] from one of those moments where he's
[1:19:52] lying down and thinking lord
[1:19:54] every time i'm over 50 years old
[1:19:59] you know thinking about all of this
[1:20:01] and
[1:20:02] brother branham confessed that he was he
[1:20:04] was afraid of death
[1:20:07] and his fear of death is that uh he
[1:20:09] never wanted to be a floating spirit
[1:20:12] because he always thought that when men
[1:20:14] die you know they they just keep
[1:20:16] floating around he said that's that was
[1:20:18] his thought
[1:20:19] you know until god gave him that visit
[1:20:22] behind the curtain of time to make him
[1:20:25] to understand i know man is not just a
[1:20:27] spirit man we have a body
[1:20:29] that we go into
[1:20:33] praise the lord and he's sitting there
[1:20:35] and have his hand behind his head
[1:20:37] and say lord and
[1:20:39] and uh you know
[1:20:40] what what would become of meaning you
[1:20:43] know then all of that and then you know
[1:20:45] god
[1:20:46] give him
[1:20:47] a visit
[1:20:49] the life of a prophet
[1:20:52] is not a life that you can search on
[1:20:54] google
[1:20:59] is not a life that you can search on
[1:21:01] google
[1:21:02] the life of a prophet is not alive that
[1:21:05] a man that is still struggling with loss
[1:21:07] and lies can explain
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:18] it's not a life
[1:21:23] that you can find on youtube
[1:21:25] either
[1:21:29] may god give us grace
[1:21:32] let's get back to our subject of reward

[1:38:45] oh let this mind be in you like the
[1:38:47] apostle paul will say
[1:38:50] like he was in christ jesus
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:55] please lord
[1:38:59] please father
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:14] young brothers young sisters brothers
[1:39:17] and sisters
[1:39:19] let's realize
[1:39:22] that this body
[1:39:24] was not giving to us for us to just seek
[1:39:26] our own pleasure
[1:39:31] god gave us this body to express himself
[1:39:35] and brother branham says it's only the
[1:39:37] thing that serves god's purpose promise
[1:39:40] to rise again
[1:39:48] oh may god just move upon our
[1:39:52] hearts and help us and teach us
[1:39:59] he changed our mind he changed our heart
[1:40:04] he gave us a life of dedication
[1:40:07] whether we are going to school
[1:40:09] whether we are going to work
[1:40:12] we can have all of our ambitions
[1:40:16] but let there be a driving desire behind
[1:40:18] those ambitions
[1:40:21] to save god's purpose
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:24] let there be a driving
[1:40:26] a crave
[1:40:29] that god will be able to
[1:40:30] [Music]
[1:40:31] he will be able to
[1:40:34] to use me
[1:40:37] to draw people to him
[1:40:42] it must not just be of
[1:40:45] how intelligent we want to show ourself
[1:40:52] they always show in how we deal with
[1:40:54] issues
[1:40:57] they always show and that's the reason
[1:41:00] why
[1:41:01] god allowed issues to come to us
[1:41:03] [Music]
[1:41:06] the scripture says teen others
[1:41:09] better
[1:41:11] are you the first one to say oh i'm very
[1:41:13] sorry i'm sorry
[1:41:16] i'm sorry i'm completely sorry
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:19] oh are you the first one to take a
[1:41:21] defense
[1:41:30] remember we would all be rewarded for
[1:41:34] what we did in this body
[1:41:36] now you think about
[1:41:38] the people that smoke the people that
[1:41:40] drunk
[1:41:41] the people that commit adultery
[1:41:43] the people that
[1:41:44] that you know that god themselves in all
[1:41:47] the evils
[1:41:48] [Music]
[1:41:50] and god has given us a grace
[1:41:53] a fountain in the house
[1:41:56] of david
[1:41:58] a fountain in the house of david
[1:42:01] has breakfast before us
[1:42:05] why can't we plunge beneath the floor
[1:42:09] why can't we plunge in that fountain
[1:42:13] and say lord i've done horrible things
[1:42:15] in this body
[1:42:17] but i come to that fountain
[1:42:20] in the house of david for all
[1:42:22] uncleanness
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:32] oh that's the reason why the preaching
[1:42:35] of the world
[1:42:37] god has given us
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:41] a purifying word
[1:42:47] we can just plunge in that word the seed
[1:42:49] of forgetfulness
[1:43:23] flow through mean holy spirit
[1:43:26] let your sing dead and we pray tonight

[1:43:45] oh come jesus
[1:43:48] come lord jesus
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:44:04] that's the reason why we cannot boast in
[1:44:07] our past
[1:44:09] because there is nothing good in those
[1:44:10] past
[1:44:18] to wash worship
[1:44:21] and
[1:44:22] to
[1:44:26] live
