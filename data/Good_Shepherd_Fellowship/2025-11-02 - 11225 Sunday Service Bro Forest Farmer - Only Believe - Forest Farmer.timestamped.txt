[54:09] Oh yes,

[54:16] Oh, the Bible

[54:23] Oh yes,
[54:26] Jesus
[54:28] loved me.
[54:31] Oh yes,
[54:33] Jesus
[54:35] loves me.
[54:37] Oh yes,
[54:40] Jesus
[54:42] loved me.
[54:45] For the Bible
[54:48] tells me so,
[54:55] just before we uh call the preacher up,
[54:59] uh Emmanuel, if you can just post my uh
[55:02] my quote for some reason, I don't know
[55:05] whether it is Uh
[55:08] our
[55:09] uh
[55:12] whether it is our
[55:18] uh
[55:20] whether it's from our subword or or the
[55:23] or maybe it's a change but from from
[55:26] what I have on my phone for some reason
[55:29] uh a portion of the prayer line is cut
[55:31] from that from that message we're
[55:34] praying playing this morning but I I
[55:36] just want to uh uh No, I'll post the the
[55:42] code that I sent you in your email.
[55:46] Is that the voice?
[55:49] H Okay, then don't don't don't post the
[55:53] the the
[55:56] voice. Just post the quote and then play
[55:58] the voice if if you can
[56:02] try it. Let's see if it works.
[56:15] If it does not just just play the just
[56:17] just post the code and then we will read
[56:19] it
[56:21] or maybe I just play from my phone.
[56:38] There's a man
[56:40] waiting for a child next
[56:49] got something wrong with his feet.
[56:52] That's right, isn't it?
[56:56] I don't know. Are you your stranger to
[56:57] me?
[57:00] Mr. Farmer, do you believe that God's
[57:01] going to heal a child and make it well?
[57:04] If I'm a stranger, do you raise your
[57:06] hands like that? Is that what she's
[57:08] praying about? Is that what your name is
[57:09] all about? Just raise your hand. You
[57:12] have your request.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; So, uh there's uh brother Brandon
[57:24] calling brother Farmer uh dad in the in
[57:28] the prayer line. That's what I wanted
[57:30] for us to play and that was the reason
[57:31] why we started playing that message
[57:33] yesterday.
[57:35] And uh uh uh you see it is is uh is is
[57:40] no form of uh uh it's it's not about uh
[57:44] forest farmer. Uh the reason why I
[57:47] thought uh uh you know uh I needed to
[57:50] play it and I do it all the time
[57:51] whenever he preached for us. It is just
[57:54] a way to uh
[57:58] to encourage our faith. Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; It just and I believe that's that's what
[58:03] the tape is for.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham says
[58:06] rapturing faith out on those tapes.
[58:08] Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's it's all there when we listen
[58:11] to what God uh uh has done and what he's
[58:15] doing. Uh it gave us faith to believe
[58:18] for our situation. Praise the Lord. But
[58:21] you think about it this morning if uh uh
[58:25] you know uh how many years that was. I
[58:28] think there that was 1961
[58:31] and um um April 27 if my mind set me
[58:36] right. Uh and and you think about that.
[58:39] Uh and and he said that uh uh I believe
[58:44] if we still had Congressman Upure and he
[58:48] was in Minneapolis and we could get a
[58:50] hold of him to come to Good Shepherd and
[58:52] and just fellowship with us and say
[58:54] Congressman you just uh we give you five
[58:57] minutes of our time just testify and it
[59:00] would not be about the testimony
[59:03] &gt;&gt; even though he will be telling us what
[59:05] he experienced and what happened to him
[59:08] but for you and myself to be able to see
[59:10] a man that was lying in the bed for for
[59:14] how many years crippled because he fell
[59:16] from from on the hearse and yet he's
[59:18] standing before us. Praise the Lord. And
[59:21] I think that is the same thing this
[59:22] morning. If we ever had the privilege to
[59:25] have that blind man in m in St. John
[59:27] chapter 9 in our assembly and and and uh
[59:30] and and brought him to the pulpit and
[59:32] say just give us a testimony and you and
[59:35] you and you sitting there and you're
[59:36] looking at a man that was blind that was
[59:39] born blind and he's looking at you back.
[59:43] What a feeling.
[59:47] What a feeling
[59:50] that the thing that you have read about
[59:52] in the Bible.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; The person you have read about in the
[59:57] Bible. Praise the Lord.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] And how many times I've listened to that
[1:00:03] tape uh uh uh I mean every other year I
[1:00:06] go through my my daily uh uh tape
[1:00:09] listening to audience and uh and and and
[1:00:12] just to come to that reality there what
[1:00:15] I've heard on tape and and year is right
[1:00:18] right there before me uh a man that was
[1:00:24] crippled as a boy
[1:00:26] sitting in the meeting and he was not
[1:00:29] even on the front row. They were back in
[1:00:32] the balcony. I think the last time when
[1:00:34] brother Farmer was here, he show us the
[1:00:37] picture way back in the balcony. But yet
[1:00:40] the Holy Ghost pick him up. Don't you
[1:00:43] believe that that God knows where you
[1:00:45] are sitting this morning
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; and he knows uh what is the need in your
[1:00:50] life?
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; What you thinking in your mind?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon will say your thoughts
[1:00:56] are not even hidden from me.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:01] Let's stand on our feet now.
[1:01:04] It's by grace
[1:01:10] that I'm in this place.
[1:01:16] I don't know
[1:01:18] how God choose me, but I'm thankful
[1:01:24] that he did.
[1:01:28] I'm only
[1:01:30] in this message
[1:01:33] by grace.
[1:01:39] I'm holy
[1:01:42] in this message
[1:01:44] by grace.
[1:01:51] It is only
[1:01:53] by grace
[1:01:57] that I'm in this place.
[1:02:02] I don't know
[1:02:05] how God choose me,
[1:02:08] but I'm thankful
[1:02:11] that he paid.
[1:02:13] I am holy
[1:02:17] in this message
[1:02:20] by grace.
[1:02:23] Oh yes,

[1:02:43] that

[1:02:48] I don't know
[1:02:51] how he choose me
[1:02:54] but I'm thankful
[1:02:57] that he did
[1:02:59] I am only
[1:03:02] in this message
[1:03:06] by grace. Let's sing that one more time.
[1:03:09] Oh yes, I am holy
[1:03:14] in this message
[1:03:16] by grace.
[1:03:22] It is only
[1:03:25] by grace
[1:03:28] that I'm in this place.
[1:03:33] I don't know
[1:03:36] how he choose me,
[1:03:39] but I'm thankful
[1:03:42] that he did.
[1:03:45] I am only
[1:03:48] in this message
[1:03:51] by grace. Come on.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; I'll never get tired
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; of the song.
[1:04:15] of amazing
[1:04:18] grace,
[1:04:20] how sweet
[1:04:23] the sound
[1:04:43] Oh,
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; but now
[1:04:50] I have
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; I have
[1:04:56] But now
[1:04:59] I see.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; God bless y'all this morning.
[1:05:11] I'm sorry I held you so long last night,
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; but I'm so glad that the Lord came up
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; this morning as we approached the Lord.
[1:05:25] If you'd have an unspoken request or
[1:05:28] something, you just want to raise your
[1:05:29] hand. Uh, by God's grace, about the time
[1:05:34] that service started last night, we had
[1:05:38] a a deacon
[1:05:40] uh there in the town that that I live
[1:05:44] close to that was in a horrible accident
[1:05:50] and yet there was no fatalities in it.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus, thank you, Lord.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. and it he'll be in some
[1:05:59] pain and uh had a a fractured a disc in
[1:06:04] his back, but we're trusting the Lord to
[1:06:07] touch him and heal him.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; But thanking God for what he did.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; But from the looks of the car, you
[1:06:16] wouldn't expect that anyone would
[1:06:18] survive it.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; A car hit him head on at 65 mph. Yes.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; But the Lord was merciful.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:06:36] Lord, we
[1:06:38] we could exhaust the clock
[1:06:43] before we could ever express our
[1:06:45] gratitude for you, Lord. Yes, sir.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; And all that you've done, all that your
[1:06:51] amazing grace has performed for us,
[1:06:54] Lord.
[1:06:57] But we thank you for it. And now this
[1:07:00] morning, Lord, you see the hands that we
[1:07:03] lifted up to you.
[1:07:06] And Lord, we're trusting you again this
[1:07:09] morning.
[1:07:11] May you come down amongst us, Father.
[1:07:16] Make yourself known to each and
[1:07:19] everyone. We pray in the name of the
[1:07:23] Lord Jesus.
[1:07:30] Amen.
[1:07:32] If you want to turn in the scriptures, I
[1:07:35] I'd like to read from Colossians 1 and
[1:07:39] 12. I I know brother Juan had had just
[1:07:43] played that portion of the message of of
[1:07:46] only believe
[1:07:48] where uh brother Brennham had called out
[1:07:51] my dad about my feet.
[1:07:56] Brother Brandon made a statement in
[1:07:58] there. He said, "You've got your
[1:07:59] request."
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; My dad's request was, "If that was God's
[1:08:03] prophet, let him call me out about my
[1:08:07] voice speak."
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; By so many infallible proofs.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:18] uh you know in in spiritual food in due
[1:08:21] season there was a a sister that came up
[1:08:25] through the prayer line and and uh when
[1:08:28] she come up uh brother Brandham said uh
[1:08:31] you're real nervous and then he said
[1:08:35] you're just that right time to get
[1:08:37] nervous. He said what it is it's a a
[1:08:41] lady's trouble a female trouble. And he
[1:08:45] said, "And another thing said, you
[1:08:47] desire the Holy Ghost."
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Do you believe if I lay
[1:08:55] hands on you, the Holy Ghost will come?"
[1:08:57] And she says, "Yes." And he said, "You
[1:09:00] believe that?" She said, "Yes, sir."
[1:09:03] So, Brother Brandham lays hands on her
[1:09:05] and he said, "Lord, I pray that the Holy
[1:09:08] Ghost would come in the apostolic form."
[1:09:13] And as she goes away, he said, "Now
[1:09:18] remember, it's the children's bread."
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; And about that time, my mother stepped
[1:09:25] up. And mom and dad had had four of us
[1:09:28] kids then, but they wanted another one.
[1:09:32] And my mother was standing in the line
[1:09:34] for it because the doctor had told the
[1:09:38] mom and dad they couldn't have any more
[1:09:40] children because it was apt to take my
[1:09:42] mother's life. She had a lot of trouble
[1:09:45] carrying the two sisters that are
[1:09:47] younger than me. And when she stepped
[1:09:50] up, Brother Brandham said, "You had a
[1:09:52] funny feeling when I said female
[1:09:55] trouble, didn't you?"
[1:09:57] Said, "Because that's what you had.
[1:10:02] Y'all know I don't speak real perfect
[1:10:05] English,
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; but I do know that had is behind you.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; That was on July the 18th. I could read
[1:10:16] in the scriptures this morning about how
[1:10:18] that Melchazedc showed up and Abraham
[1:10:23] had a meeting for him.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. And he said, "According to the time
[1:10:27] of life,
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; but in my lifetime."
[1:10:33] Nine months and 10 days later on April
[1:10:36] the 26th
[1:10:39] 28th, pardon me, my baby brother was
[1:10:42] born.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; He's a deacon at Brother Josh Bennett's
[1:10:46] Church in North Carolina this morning.
[1:10:48] Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; I was there when brother Wayey was
[1:10:53] raised from the dead.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:56] Sister Carlin and brother Scotty I had
[1:11:00] brother way in their home for a week
[1:11:03] where he had told them about what had
[1:11:05] happened
[1:11:07] of how that when brother Brandham was
[1:11:09] talking about a a a
[1:11:12] complex and that we all have complexes
[1:11:15] and we all have things that affect us.
[1:11:18] But thank God that the Holy Ghost comes
[1:11:22] not only to heal our body, not only the
[1:11:25] soul, but even our spirits that get wor.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; But he turned to his wife and said, "I
[1:11:33] resent that."
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; If you're listening to the tape about
[1:11:38] three minutes later, he's laying in the
[1:11:41] floor dead.
[1:11:44] Brother Brandham told everybody said,
[1:11:46] "Just be praying." and he walked around
[1:11:48] this side of the platform.
[1:11:50] Brother Charlie Cox said he always liked
[1:11:54] to take the position on that side. He
[1:11:57] said because brother Brandham said the
[1:11:59] angel would come and stand at his right
[1:12:02] side. Said if he had to go there, he had
[1:12:05] to come past me.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham just walked
[1:12:11] around that side and went down to where
[1:12:13] the brother way was laying there dead,
[1:12:17] laid hands on him and said, "Lord, I
[1:12:20] pray that you'd come and restore my
[1:12:22] brother's life to him." He tells about
[1:12:25] it that night on the next service. And
[1:12:28] he said his heartbeat three times real
[1:12:30] fast like thump thump thump and then
[1:12:32] just went to be normal. Brother Weey
[1:12:35] opened his eyes and wanted to know what
[1:12:37] happened.
[1:12:41] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:12:44] and forever.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; And what he did back there, he can still
[1:12:49] do today. If he was a healer in the
[1:12:53] meetings then, he's still a healer here
[1:12:56] this morning.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that we've been able to
[1:13:01] see the works of God?
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:06] You know, there's an old song that we
[1:13:08] used to sing. I'm sorry. I don't mean to
[1:13:10] keep you standing, but
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; I I just have to say it as it comes to
[1:13:15] me.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And the song said, "Every time a robin
[1:13:21] flies, you just dedicated a little one."
[1:13:25] Or a newborn baby cries, I know that I
[1:13:30] have seen the works of the Lord.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:35] Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me to ever be mindful of his
[1:13:41] work.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Father, as we look at your word this
[1:13:45] morning, ask may you come down and
[1:13:49] quicken your word to us, Lord, that it
[1:13:53] would become alive in our hearts. We
[1:13:55] pray for we ask it in the name of the
[1:13:58] Lord Jesus. the uplifted hands, Lord.
[1:14:03] All the needs that we have, you're here
[1:14:07] to take care of them. And we so thank
[1:14:11] you. That's what the songs of praise to
[1:14:14] you, Lord, has been about this morning.
[1:14:19] Now may you come down and in heaven our
[1:14:21] praise Lord
[1:14:24] and our hearts and our bodies, our minds
[1:14:29] for your glory
[1:14:40] in Colossians chapter 1.
[1:14:44] I'd like to start reading at the 12th
[1:14:47] verse.
[1:14:50] I'm sorry. I don't mean to be such a big
[1:14:53] baby.
[1:15:01] But when his presence comes through,
[1:15:11] giving thanks
[1:15:14] unto the Father, which have made us
[1:15:17] meat,
[1:15:20] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[1:15:24] the saints in life,
[1:15:27] who hath delivered
[1:15:30] us from the power of darkness
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; and hath translated us
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of his dear son.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; In whom we have redemption
[1:15:45] through his blood, even the forgiveness
[1:15:49] of sins.
[1:15:52] Praise God.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Who is the image
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; of the invisible God, the firstborn of
[1:16:02] every creature. For by him were all
[1:16:06] things created, that are in heaven, that
[1:16:10] are in earth, visible and invisible,
[1:16:14] whether they be thrones or dominions
[1:16:19] or principalities
[1:16:21] or powers.
[1:16:23] All things were created by him
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; and for
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; may the Lord add his blessings to his
[1:16:34] word.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; You can be seated.
[1:16:42] We know the prophet of God has told us
[1:16:44] that
[1:16:48] before that he ever created a flesh body
[1:16:53] of Jesus
[1:16:55] but spirit Christ
[1:16:58] created all things.
[1:17:02] Everything that was created. The angels
[1:17:05] that was created,
[1:17:08] you and I that were created
[1:17:12] before we had this.
[1:17:26] and was with him back there.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Farmer, do you
[1:17:33] understand all of that?" No, I don't.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; But I believe it because it's his word.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Church, there's many things that I don't
[1:17:44] understand. I just have to tell you that
[1:17:47] this morning.
[1:17:51] We sing songs and we hear people talk
[1:17:55] about what will it be when we get over
[1:17:59] there and and and we've heard songs
[1:18:01] about how that we'll ask the questions
[1:18:05] and he'll tell us why when we talk it
[1:18:09] over in the by and by. But will we even
[1:18:13] need to do that, sis?
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Because we're going to know him as he is
[1:18:20] because we're going to have a glorious
[1:18:23] body likened on to his.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Will we even have a need
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; to ask him?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Or will we just know?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; I don't know. But I can tell you this
[1:18:40] that when the prophet of God got
[1:18:43] translated the same word that's used
[1:18:46] here of of you and I remember there's
[1:18:50] only two places in the scripture that it
[1:18:53] ever speaks of translated and that was
[1:18:56] Enoch and his rapture and hers about us
[1:19:00] in our rapture.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; That we have been translated. Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, church, it's not that I
[1:19:08] will miss the rapture. I'm already part
[1:19:11] of it
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; because I've already been translated out
[1:19:17] of the works of darkness and into this
[1:19:20] kingdom of light.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:24] But how did the prophet
[1:19:28] him grieving
[1:19:30] the lowest point in his life tried to
[1:19:33] take his own life and a gun wouldn't go
[1:19:37] off.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; I've not had to face grief like that to
[1:19:44] I've not had to lose a little one.
[1:19:48] I haven't had to lose one.
[1:19:56] And he said he went to sleep or
[1:19:59] something.
[1:20:03] And he said, "I dreamed that I was going
[1:20:05] out across the prairie." He said, "There
[1:20:09] was a wagon there with a busted wheel on
[1:20:12] it." And I was singing the song.
[1:20:16] "Oh, the wheel on the wagon is broken."
[1:20:19] And he said it represented my broken
[1:20:22] home.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Remember
[1:20:34] little Sharon Rose
[1:20:36] was only about a ninemon old baby, just
[1:20:41] big enough. Brother Brandham talked
[1:20:42] about when they took the chair away that
[1:20:45] he came home and and his wife said I I
[1:20:49] had the boys to dig you up some worms
[1:20:51] and and said he'd honk the horn on the
[1:20:54] car and little Becky would hold or or
[1:20:57] little Sharon Rose would hold out her
[1:21:00] arms and just start gooing.
[1:21:03] Amen.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; But over there,
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; beautiful young blondhaired girl come
[1:21:12] up.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Hello, daddy.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "Daddy,
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; and said, "Ma'am, you're almost as old
[1:21:22] as I am."
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; She said, "Daddy, you don't know where
[1:21:27] you're at."
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:31] said on earth I was your Sharon Rose
[1:21:36] and he said Sharon honey I don't
[1:21:38] understand
[1:21:41] had a 9-month old baby but over there
[1:21:45] said daddy remember your teaching on
[1:21:47] immortality that's a pretty big word for
[1:21:51] a 9-month old baby
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I don't understand all of it but I know
[1:21:56] it
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; yes that's right hallelujah Amen.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; God's fornowledge.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; I just want to share a little bit a few
[1:22:10] things with you this morning.
[1:22:18] The prophet of God told us that the
[1:22:20] Bible was was set in order so perfectly
[1:22:24] mathematically.
[1:22:28] And we see that how from the covenant
[1:22:31] that God made with Abraham,
[1:22:34] it was exactly
[1:22:36] 14 generations
[1:22:40] to David coming on the scene.
[1:22:45] And then it was another 14 generations
[1:22:51] to where Israel had went into captivity.
[1:22:54] We were talking some about last night
[1:22:56] about how they were up and down and up
[1:22:59] and down. And if you have a study Bible,
[1:23:02] you look in it where they had kings that
[1:23:05] were peaks of righteousness and and then
[1:23:08] they had the depths of one that that
[1:23:12] wasn't worth shooting hardly.
[1:23:16] Then they'd be back up and and even with
[1:23:19] the judges, how they were just up and
[1:23:22] down and and oh, how many times that we
[1:23:25] can look at our own lives, how that oh
[1:23:28] my, we come out of a service like what
[1:23:30] we had last night and you're way up
[1:23:33] here, but but then it seemed like
[1:23:35] something will happen and if I if I
[1:23:38] would have let it when I I went home and
[1:23:41] my wife telling me which I had called
[1:23:45] her
[1:23:46] about what was going on before the
[1:23:49] service of what was was being posted up
[1:23:53] here and what was being played. The the
[1:23:56] portion of the tape that you were
[1:23:58] listening to
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; was the same thing that we were sharing
[1:24:04] at home and my pastor sent me a text
[1:24:08] with part of that in it
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; three days ago. Amen.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; But the God that's over Arkansas is the
[1:24:16] same God that's in Minnesota. And what
[1:24:20] he's what he's want to get across to his
[1:24:23] people.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; What he's trying to tell his people,
[1:24:27] then you'll hear that it's over in
[1:24:29] Tennessee. And you'll hear that it's
[1:24:32] down at Ever, Texas. And what is it?
[1:24:35] It's not because we're all getting on
[1:24:37] the phone conversing with one another,
[1:24:40] but we're on a
[1:24:42] to the glory.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. here. A few years ago, you know,
[1:24:49] before
[1:24:51] they they had these things that was
[1:24:53] called a a prepaid phone plan,
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; and it was cheaper and because you could
[1:25:00] make some money if you sold the program
[1:25:03] to somebody else and and oh,
[1:25:08] they would just almost drive you crazy.
[1:25:11] People that didn't want nothing to do
[1:25:13] with you. It's all brother
[1:25:16] Yeah. Right.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Have you got a phone plan?
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; And I told one of them they'd had about
[1:25:25] three of them to go through the church.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yes, brother. I have a
[1:25:30] phone plan." He said, "Have you got the
[1:25:33] uh the uh new plan?" I I I said, "No,
[1:25:36] I've got the old plan."
[1:25:40] And he said, "Oh, well, brother, on the
[1:25:43] new plan, I can get a hold of the owner
[1:25:47] of I can get a hold of the head of the
[1:25:50] company."
[1:25:53] I said, "I can do that."
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, you can." I said, "Yes,
[1:25:58] sir. I sure can." I said, "24 hours a
[1:26:01] day."
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Well,
[1:26:07] is it STS?" I said, "No, it it's not
[1:26:10] STS." I said, "It's RTS."
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've never heard of RTS." I
[1:26:18] said, "I'm sorry to hear that." I said,
[1:26:20] "It's the best there is." He said, "RTS?
[1:26:24] What does that stand for?" I said,
[1:26:26] "Royal Telephone Service. Telephone the
[1:26:29] glory. Oh, what joy to find. I can feel
[1:26:33] the moving on."
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:38] Oh yeah, I'm a salesman for RTF.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sell you a policy this
[1:26:45] morning.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Farmer, does it put a lot of
[1:26:48] money in your pocket? No. But the
[1:26:51] retirement benefits are out of this
[1:26:53] world.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, these things that they
[1:27:02] come and go, but I I want you to see
[1:27:05] that through all of this, God had a
[1:27:08] plan.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; 14 generations to David, then another 14
[1:27:15] generations to the children of Israel.
[1:27:18] Now, they went through their golden age
[1:27:21] under the reign of Solomon, but then it
[1:27:24] went down, down, down, down until
[1:27:28] finally the Lord in having to get them
[1:27:31] to turn their eyes back on him.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes the Lord has to do
[1:27:40] you and me that way.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] When everything's going good, it seems
[1:27:46] like our prayer life slacks off.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; But when we get bombarded with prayer
[1:27:53] requests that's coming in, Sherry and I
[1:27:56] uh in uh there on Friday before I left,
[1:28:01] just Friday morning, we had three or
[1:28:03] four new prayer requests. Uh people was
[1:28:06] calling or sending a text and saying,
[1:28:09] "Hey, we need to pray for this. We need
[1:28:12] to pray for that.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Then it drives you to your knees again.
[1:28:19] Although you may have spent time in
[1:28:21] prayer this morning, but something else
[1:28:24] comes in. Well, let's just pray for him
[1:28:26] right now.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; And God would have to do something to
[1:28:34] Israel to cause them to turn their eyes
[1:28:38] back onto him.
[1:28:43] But then another 14 generations.
[1:28:47] God's not just counting time and years,
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; But these three great events to the
[1:28:56] coming of the Messiah was another 14
[1:29:01] generations.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; 42 generations
[1:29:07] that God was looking at.
[1:29:13] Are you following me?
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; And then somebody says, "Oh, but
[1:29:19] California hasn't
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; some
[1:29:23] yet."
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, it wasn't made manifest
[1:29:32] during Brother Brandham's lifetime.
[1:29:38] Neither was all of Isaiah's prophecy
[1:29:42] manifested
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; for almost 800 years.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; But because God had said, "A virgin
[1:29:50] shall conceive."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; There had to come a time. Now, did they
[1:29:56] understand it? Probably Isaiah didn't
[1:30:00] understand it either, but all he knew
[1:30:03] was God had said it and he had the
[1:30:06] boldness as a man of God to come forth
[1:30:09] and just tell the people God said it was
[1:30:12] going to be this way.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; They might have asked Isaiah, "When is
[1:30:17] it going to be?" I don't know, but it's
[1:30:20] coming. The same WAY THAT A PROPHET IN
[1:30:23] THIS DAY SAID THAT GOD HAD A BRIDE THAT
[1:30:27] would not fall. THE FIRST EVE FELL, BUT
[1:30:30] THE second Eve would not fall.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; How can that be? I don't know. I DON'T
[1:30:36] UNDERSTAND IT. BUT GOD SAVE.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 7, the prophet sent up to King
[1:30:52] Ahaz and and told him, he said, "Ask God
[1:30:55] for a sign."
[1:30:58] And that king,
[1:31:00] oh, I would to God, we had some
[1:31:02] politicians around now that was that
[1:31:04] humble.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will not challenge God like
[1:31:11] that.
[1:31:14] He said, "I'll not tempt God."
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; But Isaiah turns back around and tells
[1:31:22] him and says, "Behold,
[1:31:26] God will give you a sign."
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Isaiah, that's never happened before.
[1:31:37] Now, you know, to us, 750 or 800 years
[1:31:41] sounds like a long time.
[1:31:46] It's been 500 years since Columbus
[1:31:49] discovered America.
[1:31:54] Plymouth Rock and the Pilgrim,
[1:31:57] 400.
[1:32:01] I was up in the Northeast here not too
[1:32:03] long ago.
[1:32:07] come back through some of that. And I I
[1:32:09] I I
[1:32:11] didn't have the time to do it because of
[1:32:14] of where I needed to be that next day,
[1:32:19] but uh I I was within 120 miles of
[1:32:22] Plymouth Rock up there. And you know
[1:32:26] some of these places where things have
[1:32:28] happened
[1:32:30] where men have stood by the grace of God
[1:32:33] I've been able to stand behind three
[1:32:35] pull pits but the prophet of God preach
[1:32:41] it gracious
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; here I was telling brother one the other
[1:32:47] day it's been uh
[1:32:51] maybe five or six weeks ago that I was
[1:32:54] up in Sabino Canyon
[1:32:57] and we we're standing right there at
[1:32:59] Eagle Rock and and it turned into a
[1:33:02] church service
[1:33:09] a young min I say young ministry 40 45
[1:33:14] years old but you know when you get my
[1:33:16] age everybody's young
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; all that's right
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; but uh at any rate he had said something
[1:33:23] he said I don't remember the tape that
[1:33:25] it's on, but I just heard it a couple
[1:33:27] three weeks before. And I said,
[1:33:29] "Brother, I believe that's on." And when
[1:33:32] I did, this other brother and his wife
[1:33:35] and three little kids probably from six
[1:33:40] or seven and maybe the oldest one, 12,
[1:33:44] and a sister Walls, which
[1:33:48] uh the brother uh Brian Walls is a
[1:33:52] nephew to brother Mike Walls that has a
[1:33:55] church up here in Ohio. And uh so as it
[1:33:59] was, brother Doug Baker passed me off on
[1:34:02] him for because he was going to take
[1:34:04] this other family and he wanted to know
[1:34:06] if it'd be all right with me if I just
[1:34:09] went. And I said, "Sure." He he said,
[1:34:11] "You'll enjoy it." And so when I met
[1:34:14] him, I said, "I'm telling you right now,
[1:34:17] Brother Doug Baker said, I was going to
[1:34:18] enjoy you." So I I'm looking forward to
[1:34:21] it. But uh
[1:34:25] brother uh Brian's wife said uh brother
[1:34:30] Farmer were you ever in any of brother
[1:34:32] Brandham's meeting.
[1:34:37] Don't ask me that.
[1:34:41] I said the first one that I was in I was
[1:34:45] healed.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And I just started witnessing to her.
[1:34:49] But I'm looking up on my phone and we
[1:34:52] had enough signal up in Sabino Canyon.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; That when I got done telling it, I
[1:35:01] played what your pastor played this
[1:35:04] morning.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; And she stood there crying.
[1:35:12] And uh
[1:35:15] what I didn't know until
[1:35:18] a month ago, five weeks ago when I was
[1:35:21] up there, is where that rock had eagle
[1:35:24] in it that brother Brandham took the
[1:35:27] picture of it. They was planning on
[1:35:29] building a park up at the head of Sabino
[1:35:33] Canyon back years and years ago. And
[1:35:36] during the depression, they run out of
[1:35:39] money. But some of their uh preparation
[1:35:42] work they had drilled down in Eagle Rock
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; because they was going to that's where
[1:35:49] the road was going to be to go up to
[1:35:52] this lake and and park that they was
[1:35:54] going to do at the head of of Sabino
[1:35:57] Creek.
[1:36:00] And when they blasted that off
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; it was in this age
[1:36:10] That rock had been there for eons of
[1:36:12] time.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; But it was in this age that that word
[1:36:17] eagle was revealed. When they blasted it
[1:36:20] off, it was
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; what God has done in this day.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; How many generations back was it that he
[1:36:32] put eagle in that rock?
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:36:39] I don't need to know because everything
[1:36:42] that I have need to know. He will reveal
[1:36:46] to us.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; So we see the Lord though wasn't just
[1:36:54] measuring in in in years but by all of
[1:37:00] these generations.
[1:37:03] But I want you to notice that a virgin
[1:37:06] shall conceive
[1:37:08] did not start 2800 years ago.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; But whenever it was
[1:37:35] that we was a thought in God's mind.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Isaiah's prophecy was a thought in God's
[1:37:43] mind with us.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; It didn't start to 2800 years ago, but
[1:37:50] it was somewhere back there that there's
[1:37:53] no way to measure because it was part of
[1:37:56] eternity. Remember everything that we
[1:38:00] know is time was just that hickey.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Everything else it just was.
[1:38:11] In the beginning was the word and the
[1:38:15] word was God.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; The word was was with God and the word
[1:38:23] was God. Amen.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; It just was. I don't have to put a time
[1:38:29] on it. You don't have to put a time on
[1:38:32] it. You don't even have to explain it to
[1:38:35] a skeptic because if they're skeptical
[1:38:37] enough, they'd find something wrong with
[1:38:40] the infallible proofs they already have.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; But yet the infallible proofs are yet
[1:38:48] manifesting themsel over and over and
[1:38:52] over. things that brother Brandham said
[1:38:54] on tape, they're just now finding out
[1:38:57] about it down here at Rochester.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; It's truth.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; They're finding out that worry causes
[1:39:10] cancer. We heard that on a tape.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:19] They're just now discovering that.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; How far advanced would medical science
[1:39:25] have been
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; if the doctors and the scientist would
[1:39:30] have just sat down and talked to a
[1:39:33] prophet?
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Brandham talked
[1:39:36] about how that that Einstein when he
[1:39:40] found that a theory of relativity
[1:39:43] of how that time was relative, he said
[1:39:46] he was right on the verge of discovering
[1:39:50] eternity.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Yet it's took science all this time just
[1:39:59] to try and catch up. And the more that
[1:40:01] they try to disprove God's word is, the
[1:40:05] more that they're proving it to be the
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; The works of God. Many times a prophet
[1:40:15] did not know what he prophesied
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; on things that are to be. In paragraph
[1:40:21] 28, brother Brandham says uh uh he said
[1:40:25] through the prophets, I referred to it
[1:40:27] last evening like we take Isaiah when he
[1:40:31] said a virgin shall conceive. Who would
[1:40:33] think that that a man was was thought of
[1:40:37] among the people to say such a word as
[1:40:40] that? A virgin shall conceive. But
[1:40:42] because he
[1:40:47] But because he
[1:40:50] a prophet is a reflector of God. He is
[1:40:54] made so he cannot speak his own words.
[1:40:57] It has to be God's words that he speaks.
[1:41:01] He's just like a reflector. And he is
[1:41:05] God's mouthpiece. And so therefore, he
[1:41:09] said, "A virgin shall conceive." He
[1:41:13] probably could not understand it. But
[1:41:17] God had spoke it through him because he
[1:41:20] promised that he would do nothing until
[1:41:24] he revealed it to his servants, the
[1:41:27] prophets. Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Then when he said that, it was 800 years
[1:41:32] before that ever come to pass.
[1:41:35] But it had to come to pass.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Mary and Joseph
[1:41:42] probably didn't understand.
[1:41:46] We know that Joseph was uh actually
[1:41:49] wanting to put Mary away, but he wanted
[1:41:52] to do it in a private manner where it
[1:41:55] wouldn't cause a a a lot of contention
[1:41:59] on Mary's belief.
[1:42:02] Brother Brandham said, "So Joseph said,
[1:42:05] remember,
[1:42:08] you want to know why that the Lord came
[1:42:10] down amongst us last night like he did?
[1:42:13] It's because people was expecting."
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; See, the prophet of God told us that
[1:42:20] that the Lord comes to those who are
[1:42:24] looking for him.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, God, help me to always be
[1:42:30] looking for him.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells a story about how
[1:42:41] that they went to the synagogue and that
[1:42:44] how that maybe the uh the the uh the the
[1:42:49] priest or the the rabbi had had read
[1:42:53] from the scroll of Isaiah and they were
[1:42:57] meditating.
[1:42:59] You know, it's good for us.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; I listen to a lot of tapes.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Because I draw strength from it.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; I listen to a lot of tapes because I
[1:43:13] draw healing from it.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; I listen to a lot of tapes because it
[1:43:19] gives me answers to things
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; that sometimes aren't even my questions,
[1:43:25] but other people ask me.
[1:43:28] and you turn on a tape and the Lord open
[1:43:31] up something to you through what said
[1:43:34] you call up the brother and say, "Hey,
[1:43:36] I've got your answer. Listen to this
[1:43:37] tape."
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, we're not only compelled to
[1:43:44] listen to the tape, but because we don't
[1:43:48] just need the knowledge of the word of
[1:43:51] God, but we are told to pray for
[1:43:55] revelation
[1:43:56] more than anything else. A lot of people
[1:43:59] will have a knowledge of the word and
[1:44:02] all they CAN DO IS GET DOWN WITH
[1:44:03] SOMEBODY and just fuss with them and and
[1:44:06] fight with them and and try and show
[1:44:08] what I know and what you don't know and
[1:44:11] what you don't know and what I don't
[1:44:13] know and
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; and what does that benefit but a
[1:44:17] revelation of the word of God will bring
[1:44:20] it to pass.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:24] So they were meditating
[1:44:27] on what they had heard.
[1:44:31] You ever done that, brother Juan? Just
[1:44:34] get up and preach something like the
[1:44:37] house is a fire and maybe you've even
[1:44:40] scratched down some notes on
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; and you just go home. You know, he said,
[1:44:52] and you get to looking on that, I wonder
[1:44:54] what brother Brandham had to say about
[1:44:56] that. And you look, and brother Brandham
[1:44:59] is paraphrasing what brother Juan
[1:45:02] preached.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; We've seen it time after time.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Hello. And you're sitting there
[1:45:11] meditating on Yeah. Yeah. And you know,
[1:45:16] they don't do it anymore, but it used to
[1:45:18] be that we read newspapers
[1:45:21] instead of our phone.
[1:45:24] And they had a comic strip in there. And
[1:45:27] when somebody uh uh got a revelation,
[1:45:31] they'd show a light bulb turning out
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; and you know, the light just comes on
[1:45:38] for us in an area that had been darkness
[1:45:42] before. and all. OH YES, THAT explains
[1:45:45] this. That's the real
[1:45:48] Yeah.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying?
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; I Maybe y'all don't have questions like
[1:45:59] this.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; See, I want to know what it's going to
[1:46:06] be like over there.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I interrupt myself here for
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; See, several years ago, I I under the
[1:46:14] excuse of taking the kids,
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; the Blue Angels was about or not the
[1:46:21] Blue Angels, but the Thunderbirds was
[1:46:23] performing about 120 miles away down at
[1:46:27] Jacksonville, Arkansas. So, I took the
[1:46:30] kids down to see it. No, really. Daddy
[1:46:33] wanted to go and see it.
[1:46:36] And we went down and you know right at
[1:46:39] the end oh they showed us the sheer
[1:46:43] power of that F16 of how that they
[1:46:48] had one of them just rolling a little
[1:46:50] bit and you could see the heat waves
[1:46:52] coming out. You knew that the engine was
[1:46:55] fired up, but then it starts rolling and
[1:46:58] yet it it's big enough and it's far
[1:47:01] enough away that you can't tell it. But
[1:47:04] he's already at 250 miles an hour.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; And then he pops it up just about 10
[1:47:12] foot off the ground. And the announcer
[1:47:15] says, "We will now show you the sheer
[1:47:18] power of this airplane." And he turns it
[1:47:22] and goes straight up with it
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; until it's out of sight.
[1:47:28] But right at the end of after they'd
[1:47:30] shown how close that they could fly, oh,
[1:47:34] let me tell you something. What would it
[1:47:36] be if the church of the living God could
[1:47:38] just get wing tip to wing tip with the
[1:47:42] leader? And I'm not talking about the
[1:47:44] pastor. I'm talking about the leader.
[1:47:47] Just stay just keep watching him that
[1:47:50] far away from him. Oh Lord, HOW CLOSE
[1:47:53] CAN I GET? BUT I said stay THIS CLOSE.
[1:47:56] WE LOCK IN right there.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; And the whole church get in formation.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, THAT'S THAT'S WHEN SOMEBODY I CAN
[1:48:06] SEND MY SERVANT down to Bradam
[1:48:09] Tabernacle. I can send my servant down
[1:48:12] to Good Shepherd Fellowship.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; And I know that somebody IN MY HANDS
[1:48:20] THAT I can trust and something will
[1:48:24] happen.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:26] That's right.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; That's the very end.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; They had five of them flying in a They
[1:48:35] called it the Delta Formation. The best
[1:48:38] that I remember. It's been 30, 40 years
[1:48:42] ago.
[1:48:47] And they turned and they went straight
[1:48:49] up and they was all trailing smoke.
[1:48:52] And four of them just split off like a
[1:48:55] banana people.
[1:48:59] There's one of them. He just kept going
[1:49:03] up.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; And he was spiraling
[1:49:07] till he went out of sight.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; We got back to the car and was headed
[1:49:13] home.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; I pulled over on the side of the road. I
[1:49:17] said, "You kids,
[1:49:19] I don't understand it all, but I know
[1:49:22] that one of these days we're going to
[1:49:24] travel like a thought."
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; And I don't know if you can see a
[1:49:28] thought travel or not.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; But if you look up there and you see a
[1:49:33] thought going yang, yang, yang, yang,
[1:49:36] look up there and say, "Daddy's having a
[1:49:38] ball."
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it's going to be like
[1:49:44] on the other side. But I know that it's
[1:49:47] glorious enough that I don't want to see
[1:49:50] anybody miss it.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:50:05] So Joseph said, "Well, my dear,
[1:50:08] would you go in and get one of the
[1:50:10] scrolls?"
[1:50:12] And she just by chance.
[1:50:27] She just by chance
[1:50:30] reached in
[1:50:33] and got word
[1:50:35] that the pastor had been preaching on
[1:50:38] this morning.
[1:50:43] just by chance.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. There's some
[1:50:47] of the things that too many times we
[1:50:49] think that it's just by chance. Brother
[1:50:52] Juan was sharing with me that there was
[1:50:55] something that happened yesterday
[1:50:57] evening just before service of how that
[1:51:00] I came down here way too early
[1:51:04] and the door wasn't even unlocked when
[1:51:07] uh when brother Wesley and his wife and
[1:51:10] I showed up out here.
[1:51:16] But a sister came in a little bit long,
[1:51:19] a little bit later and she had the code
[1:51:24] and brother Wesley said, "Hey, you can
[1:51:26] go in." I said, "Well, I'm just going to
[1:51:29] stay out here in the truck for a little
[1:51:31] bit." But when it come time for me to
[1:51:34] come in, they still didn't have the code
[1:51:38] to the door.
[1:51:42] How many times have we heard the prophet
[1:51:45] of God tell of things that had happened?
[1:51:49] And he said, "Oh, wait." He said, "Then
[1:51:52] I remembered there's something written
[1:51:54] down about this."
[1:51:56] One time he'd had a vision of the the
[1:51:59] rock pillars at the end of his driveway.
[1:52:02] Yeah. That was made out of Bedford stone
[1:52:05] and they they had the a a guy out there
[1:52:09] just knocking them down. And brother
[1:52:11] Brandham in the vision or dream or
[1:52:14] whatever that it was went out to him and
[1:52:17] and and said, "Hey, what are you doing?"
[1:52:21] And the guy just told him to mind his
[1:52:23] own business. And he knocked him down.
[1:52:25] And he said, "You can't talk to me like
[1:52:27] that, sir."
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; And a voice told him, "Avoid this. Go
[1:52:36] west."
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; So then he he
[1:52:43] just he writes it down in the book. He
[1:52:45] didn't understand it.
[1:52:48] But then later on several years,
[1:52:52] here's a survey state and a man that he
[1:52:55] uh grew up with. They they used they
[1:52:58] called him mud ear when he was a kid cuz
[1:53:00] somebody hit him with a a a mudball and
[1:53:04] but later they just shortened it to mud.
[1:53:07] He said, "Hey, mud, what are you doing?"
[1:53:09] He was a city engineer for
[1:53:10] Jeffersonville. He said, "Billy, they're
[1:53:13] going to uh uh widen the road through
[1:53:16] here." That's what the stakes are about.
[1:53:19] He said, "Now, like your mailbox and
[1:53:21] those pillars out there," he said,
[1:53:22] "Don't do nothing. Don't worry about
[1:53:25] them. Uh they're going to hire
[1:53:28] contractors to move that back."
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "Wait, there's
[1:53:33] something about this." Yeah.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; And he goes and gets the boat.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; And it was his instructions to go west.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham did not understand it.
[1:53:45] He said, "I don't know what I'm going to
[1:53:49] do. I'm moving out west to a place where
[1:53:53] they don't even have a church for me to
[1:53:56] take my family to.
[1:54:01] Don't ask me to explain that.
[1:54:09] I don't advise anybody to move where
[1:54:11] they ain't a Bible believing church that
[1:54:14] they can put their family in.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; I tell somebody, you move to where you
[1:54:21] got a church that'll teach you the truth
[1:54:24] and nothing but the truth.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We we I think we might ought to
[1:54:30] have preachers to start taking an oath
[1:54:32] about like they do on a witness stand.
[1:54:35] Uh, do you solemnly affirm to tell the
[1:54:39] truth and nothing but the truth?
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Or we could look at some of the other
[1:54:51] things where brother Brandham went in.
[1:54:54] He had a vision that that there was a
[1:54:56] hat laying in a certain place. He said,
[1:54:58] "Now, I couldn't move that hat."
[1:55:03] But he got in a hurry and he went ahead
[1:55:06] and prayed for the baby and the baby
[1:55:07] about died.
[1:55:10] He said, "Oh Lord, I did wrong."
[1:55:14] He went back and he just waited.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; And then mama come in,
[1:55:25] grandma.
[1:55:28] And then the hat got thrown in the
[1:55:31] chair.
[1:55:32] Now, everything was the same way that it
[1:55:35] was back here in the vision or the
[1:55:38] dream. But a sister right here had a
[1:55:41] dream that that there was a vision
[1:55:44] preacher that come into town and he
[1:55:46] needed to get into the pastor's office,
[1:55:49] but they didn't have the code for it.
[1:55:53] So, they was going to have to wait. and
[1:55:55] she got on the phone and she got the
[1:55:57] code and not even saying a word to me
[1:56:00] but just pointed towards the door that
[1:56:02] it was open.
[1:56:05] And then after it was over, she
[1:56:08] remembered the dream.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Not not that we have to do something to
[1:56:15] set it into motion, but God has already
[1:56:18] spoke.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; So it's going to take place. And then
[1:56:22] when we come into it, we're said, "Oh,
[1:56:25] that's what this is."
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham and praying for the
[1:56:29] little boy up there in Finland, how they
[1:56:31] went. He said, "There's something
[1:56:33] familiar about this." Then he turns to a
[1:56:36] brother said, "Brother said, look on the
[1:56:38] fly leaf of your Bible. Look, look at
[1:56:41] the mountains here. Look at the
[1:56:42] soldiers. Is this not the same?"
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; And then the results of that.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Russian soldiers stand there and
[1:56:54] salute uh to their mortal enemies and
[1:56:58] hug them.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Russians hugging fins
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; and saying we'll serve a God like that.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. When people can see the real
[1:57:09] genuine in action, who wouldn't want to
[1:57:12] serve a God like that?
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:17] But Joseph said, "My dear, would you go
[1:57:19] and get one of the scrolls?" And she
[1:57:21] just by chance reached in to get the
[1:57:24] scroll and brought it out. She said,
[1:57:26] "Well, dear, today seems like we read
[1:57:30] from the book of Isaiah."
[1:57:35] So she pulled open the scroll and Joseph
[1:57:39] began to read and his mind, his eyes
[1:57:43] fell upon this portion. A virgin shall
[1:57:47] conceive and shall bring forth a son.
[1:57:49] They shall call his name counselor,
[1:57:52] mighty God, the prince of peace, the
[1:57:54] everlasting father. And when he got down
[1:57:57] to the end of it, the little virgin lady
[1:58:00] sitting there by the side and said,
[1:58:03] "Just a moment, Joseph, dear, what does
[1:58:07] the prophet mean by a virgin
[1:58:10] conceiving?"
[1:58:11] Well, Jose might have said this, dear.
[1:58:15] That's just a little too deep.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; I do not understand it,
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; but I believe it.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; It's just what the Bible said. I don't
[1:58:29] know how it will happen, but this I
[1:58:32] know, dear.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; We know that Isaiah was Jehovah's
[1:58:36] prophet. Therefore, being anointed with
[1:58:39] the Holy Spirit of God upon him, he
[1:58:42] could not prophesy wrong because he was
[1:58:45] born a prophet. And we know that his
[1:58:48] words are true. And when he said, "A
[1:58:50] virgin shall conceive." That was NOT
[1:58:53] ISAIAH. THAT WAS OUR JEHOVAH. And
[1:58:56] Jehovah is able to do anything that he
[1:58:59] says he will do.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Do we understand it all? No. But do I
[1:59:06] believe it? Absolutely.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; I don't have to bring it to pass.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; God does.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; I think I told y'all about the time when
[1:59:23] I was down in old Mexico and we prayed
[1:59:26] for a whale. Ju just felt led to to get
[1:59:30] a couple five gallon buckets of water
[1:59:33] and pour it in the well. My interpreter
[1:59:35] was there with us and I asked him I I I
[1:59:38] said, "Broot, can you guide me back to
[1:59:40] that spring? It it was oh between a
[1:59:43] quarter and a half a mile away." And he
[1:59:45] he said, "Yeah." So I went and got the
[1:59:47] two buckets that the the brother you
[1:59:50] know how they got the pole with the two
[1:59:52] buckets y'all seen overseas many a time.
[1:59:57] And
[1:59:59] a boy said, "Oh, brother Farmer, let me
[2:00:02] go get a camera." And I said, "Son, we
[2:00:04] don't need a camera for this."
[2:00:06] And you know,
[2:00:10] Brother Sandy Beach was my interpreter.
[2:00:15] And when the Lord was doing something,
[2:00:18] he catch it just real quick.
[2:00:22] We'd gotten
[2:00:24] I not as far as that door.
[2:00:30] Brother Sandy was right by my side. He
[2:00:32] said, "Where are we going?" I said,
[2:00:33] "We're going to spring." Never asked
[2:00:35] another word. Well, here come the pastor
[2:00:38] from Monterey that that we was riding in
[2:00:41] his vehicle and that they told him we
[2:00:43] was going up there. Well, the brother we
[2:00:46] was staying with, you know, how some of
[2:00:49] these Mexican brothers are just about as
[2:00:52] wide as they are tall.
[2:00:55] Most of them are these Wasa Indians and
[2:00:58] that's we were up in the Wasakas, a
[2:01:01] rural area where a lot of this tribe of
[2:01:06] Indians uh lived and uh uh brother
[2:01:11] Rastro come out there and he's just
[2:01:14] built like a bull and as long as I was
[2:01:17] carrying empty buckets that was fine.
[2:01:19] But when I filled them full of water, he
[2:01:22] wanted to carry it
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; and I said, "Brother, I need to do
[2:01:25] this." So they interpret it and and he
[2:01:28] let me do it.
[2:01:30] But I passed it back to the well. We
[2:01:33] poured in those two five gallon buckets
[2:01:36] of water, laid hands on a dry well.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; See, I'd asked I I said, "Why did we go
[2:01:43] to the spring when when there's a new
[2:01:45] well here?" I know what new concrete
[2:01:47] looks like.
[2:01:49] And he said, "Brother, they dug that
[2:01:51] well four months ago," he he said, "and
[2:01:53] it gave water for a couple of weeks and
[2:01:55] then it went dry."
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; And you
[2:02:02] you you get feelings for people. You you
[2:02:05] know what I'm talking about.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; You look at people that they don't have
[2:02:10] nothing. They've got what looks like an
[2:02:13] extension cord that's run a a quarter of
[2:02:16] a mile up the side of the mountain. And
[2:02:19] then they've got a little wire like a
[2:02:21] little extension cord that comes down
[2:02:24] that has a light bulb and a socket so
[2:02:27] that they can play a tape in Spanish.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Only thing they've got power for.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; I I I'll show you a picture of it after
[2:02:38] church. a little old a a hut that's made
[2:02:42] out of bamboo with mud packed in it. But
[2:02:45] I've never felt any more at home, any
[2:02:48] place that I've ever been. Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; And I just sat there with my back
[2:02:52] against the wall and they brought me an
[2:02:55] orange to eat. The juice was running
[2:02:57] down my elbow and and I thought, "Oh,
[2:03:00] God, they they don't have any
[2:03:02] resources." And yet they've they've
[2:03:05] bought the money for the cement and and
[2:03:08] they've dug that well and and now it's
[2:03:11] gone dry. And I was sitting there
[2:03:13] thinking on what I was going to preach
[2:03:15] that night and it was Elijah and the
[2:03:17] meal offering.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Well, you remember Elijah took that meal
[2:03:21] and they told him said there's death in
[2:03:23] the pot. There was some poison gourds in
[2:03:26] it.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; But but he took that three cornered
[2:03:28] meal. He said, "Oh, that represented the
[2:03:31] Lord Jesus." that every piece of it was
[2:03:34] exactly the same size because he's the
[2:03:37] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; And now that he put it in there and he
[2:03:41] told them young prophets that it's okay
[2:03:43] to eat it now.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; And I sitting up there thinking on that
[2:03:48] when I got inspiration to to pour that
[2:03:51] water in the well.
[2:03:54] We did.
[2:03:56] We joined hands and laid hands on that
[2:03:59] well.
[2:04:01] It was about three months later that
[2:04:04] brother Australia from Monterey, Mexico
[2:04:08] was coming up into the states and now
[2:04:10] brother Sandy was interpreting from
[2:04:13] Spanish into English for us and and they
[2:04:16] called me up and I asked them to come
[2:04:18] and stay at the house. We had a a empty
[2:04:21] bedroom and and uh
[2:04:25] brother David had had told me to ask
[2:04:29] brother Estray to preach for us that
[2:04:31] night. It was on a Wednesday and uh he
[2:04:35] said he wouldn't. And he said,
[2:04:36] "Brother," he said, "I've got something
[2:04:38] all this through interpreter." He said,
[2:04:41] "I've got something I want to tell you,
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; but I feel like I need to tell the whole
[2:04:46] church."
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Okay." So that night he
[2:04:50] said, "Brother Farmer probably told you
[2:04:52] that we prayed for a well and uh
[2:04:56] a few people in the church remember it."
[2:04:59] You know, people that aren't missionary
[2:05:01] minded, sometimes they don't pay a lot
[2:05:03] of attention to what God's doing
[2:05:05] overseas. Well, let me tell you what.
[2:05:07] He's exactly the same Jehovah Gyra that
[2:05:11] he is right here as what he is in
[2:05:14] Liberia or Antonio in old Mexico or the
[2:05:18] Philippines.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; And we ought to rejoice just as much for
[2:05:23] them as we do for what we see him doing
[2:05:26] here.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Well, there's a few though that they had
[2:05:31] remembered it. And he said, "I want you
[2:05:33] to know I've drank water from the well,
[2:05:37] but not only is the well given water,
[2:05:40] but it's running over the top,
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; out of that testimony,
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; there were seven churches that sprung up
[2:05:54] in that region from the testimony of
[2:05:57] what God had done."
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We went down
[2:06:01] there a couple years later and there was
[2:06:04] a a UPC preacher. He he was a fine old
[2:06:09] gentleman and he needed a ride. And so,
[2:06:12] uh, uh, Brother James Miller, give him a
[2:06:17] we took him with us and and, uh, when we
[2:06:21] went up into that village, all of the
[2:06:23] men were gone working, but the sisters
[2:06:26] came out and was preaching to this
[2:06:29] Pentecost preacher.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; And because he's UPC, he had to listen
[2:06:35] to them.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; God's got a sense of humor.
[2:06:41] Amen.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; And they were telling him, "Oh, the well
[2:06:45] went dry, but it was pouring over the
[2:06:47] top." The picture that I've got of that
[2:06:50] well is moss that's growing on a well
[2:06:53] that's only a year old because the water
[2:06:57] was running over it for weeks and weeks.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Why should I not expect a well to run
[2:07:05] over when my cup is running over?
[2:07:10] That's what he DOES FOR US. HE'LL DO IT
[2:07:12] for whatever if we'll just trust him.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; John baptizing in the river of Jordan
[2:07:25] and he had already he had been
[2:07:28] prophesying. He had been preaching. You
[2:07:31] know, actually the prophet of God said
[2:07:34] that a New Testament preacher was a
[2:07:37] prophet because he was fortelling.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make us more than what
[2:07:45] we are. I'm just telling you what a
[2:07:47] prophet said that we was.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; And I believe that we should be willing
[2:07:51] to accept that.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; John had been preaching, there's one
[2:08:01] coming after me. I baptize you unto
[2:08:04] repentance in the river here, but
[2:08:07] there's one coming after me that when he
[2:08:10] comes, he's going to baptize you with
[2:08:14] fire.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Who could understand that,
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; John? Are you going to build Is he going
[2:08:22] to build a big fire and throw us into
[2:08:24] it?
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know. But all I know is the
[2:08:29] spirit of God is telling me he's going
[2:08:32] to fill you up with fire.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, John, is it going to burn us?
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, it'll burn the dross out of you. I
[2:08:40] don't know how it's going to happen. I'm
[2:08:43] just telling you, that's what the Lord's
[2:08:45] giving me. Yes.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; And then when he seen him come down to
[2:08:50] the river, his own second cousin
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; and he seen him coming. But he saw more
[2:08:58] than a man coming
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; because he seen a dove come down.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; And the very thing that the Lord had
[2:09:05] told him that that is the one that when
[2:09:08] you see THE SPIRIT OF GOD come down
[2:09:11] descending like a dove and it's willing
[2:09:14] to stay with him.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Not to flare off somewhere. Why? Because
[2:09:20] there is no wolf spirit in him to flare
[2:09:23] off that spirit of God. Oh God, help us
[2:09:26] to humble ourselves before the Lord that
[2:09:30] whenever he comes down, he's content to
[2:09:33] dwell with.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, nothing. We don't get in a hurry to
[2:09:39] run him off.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; John couldn't understand it when he
[2:09:46] said, "John, baptize me." And he said,
[2:09:49] "Me baptize you."
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:09:55] I've been the one that's been preparing
[2:09:57] the way for you.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; I need baptized to you.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; But he just took him back to the word.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Not to a theology,
[2:10:11] not to an idea, not to an emotion, but
[2:10:15] he just took him back to the word and he
[2:10:18] said, "John, it becometh us
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; to fulfill all right.
[2:10:24] Amen.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; And something with John, it made sense.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; If this one is the sacrifice, the
[2:10:35] sacrifice has to be bored. Yes, Lord.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; I baptize.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Did he understand it? No. But at the
[2:10:48] word of God, HE JUST DID IT. WHY?
[2:10:51] BECAUSE GOD HAD APPOINTED HIM.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; John didn't understand it all.
[2:11:01] Oh no. On the Easter Seal, Brother
[2:11:04] Brandham said, "Now, as the promised
[2:11:06] Messiah, he quickened every word that
[2:11:09] was prophesied that he would do to heal
[2:11:12] the sick, how he would be born of a
[2:11:14] virgin. All that made it true. He was
[2:11:19] the word
[2:11:21] manifested here on earth. But he could
[2:11:24] not do this just as a man. It taken the
[2:11:29] spirit of God dwelling in him to quicken
[2:11:33] those promises to him.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Oh church, can we recognize the
[2:11:41] importance of the spirit of God
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; dwelling on the inside of us. We don't
[2:11:47] just want to be baptized in the spirit,
[2:11:50] but we want the seal of the Holy Ghost
[2:11:54] upon our life.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, pardon me a second.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; I hope that we get this real clear. Now,
[2:12:08] Jesus being a man himself, the body, but
[2:12:13] it took the spirit in him, the spirit.
[2:12:17] It's not me that doeth the works, but
[2:12:21] it's my father that dwelleth in me.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; He's the one that does the works. See,
[2:12:31] Jesus himself
[2:12:33] was the word because he was before God.
[2:12:38] This is a bad word to use. I hope you
[2:12:40] take it right before a crowd. But he was
[2:12:44] predestinated
[2:12:46] by the fornowledge of God. How God's
[2:12:50] plan was to be that he would send a
[2:12:54] redeemer and this redeemer could only be
[2:12:57] his own son. And then that was God's
[2:13:01] promise all the way from the Garden of
[2:13:04] Eden that Jesus would be here. Here he
[2:13:08] was as a man born of a virgin. But it
[2:13:12] taken the spirit of God to quicken that
[2:13:15] word to him. And he was the word
[2:13:19] quicken. The word quickened for that
[2:13:22] hour.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; The time had come when you had to have a
[2:13:27] redeemer. The law had failed. Other
[2:13:31] things had failed. Now it takes a
[2:13:34] redeemer. And he was the promised
[2:13:37] redeemer. He was quickened by the word
[2:13:41] of God.
[2:13:42] And now it's that same spirit that was
[2:13:46] upon him to be the redeemer in that age
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; that we have accepted now the promise
[2:13:58] that in this last days what would take
[2:14:02] place if you
[2:14:05] become
[2:14:07] part of that word.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; You
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Are redeemed
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; with him.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:31] You are redeemed with him because the
[2:14:35] same spirit that dwelt in Christ is
[2:14:38] dwelling in you, quickening your life to
[2:14:42] this age.
[2:14:44] And it'll also in the end time quicken
[2:14:48] your mortal bodies, resurrect them,
[2:14:51] bring them up again. It takes that gloom
[2:14:54] away when we look at it in that and
[2:14:58] that's the truth.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; You see,
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; would it be okay if I could just do
[2:15:05] something here for a second?
[2:15:11] On Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[2:15:14] today, and forever.
[2:15:18] I would read you what brother Brandham
[2:15:21] said.
[2:15:31] He was anointed into the wilderness
[2:15:34] after 40 days AND DEFEATED SATAN BY the
[2:15:36] word of God.
[2:15:39] What did he do? He broke any divine
[2:15:42] promise and reached out the wicest of
[2:15:45] Christians.
[2:15:47] IF HE WAS GOD, WHY DID HE LET SATAN SAY,
[2:15:50] "IF thou be the son of God, perform a
[2:15:53] miracle here and show me you can do it.
[2:15:55] Turn these stones into bread and eat."
[2:15:58] He said, "It is written, man shall not
[2:16:00] live by bread alone."
[2:16:03] So then as Satan always tries to coat
[2:16:06] the word went back and told him when he
[2:16:08] put him at the pinnacle of the temple
[2:16:10] AND HE'S HERE AGAIN IT is written
[2:16:14] and he defeated Satan on the word of God
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; that shows that you can defeat Satan on
[2:16:21] the word of God.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; No matter the word of God will defeat
[2:16:26] Satan any place anywhere under any
[2:16:29] conditions. If it's in THE BELLY OF A
[2:16:32] WHALE, OR IF IT'S IN A LION'S DEN,
[2:16:36] if it's on the BED WITH A CANCER, OR IF
[2:16:38] IT'S LAYING DOWN OR BLEEDING TO DEATH IN
[2:16:40] AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT, THE WORD OF GOD
[2:16:44] WILL DEFEAT SATAN ANYWHERE.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; And the weakest Christian can use it.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; And the weakest Christian,
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; can use it.
[2:17:10] Are you within reach of that bottle?
[2:17:27] You
[2:17:33] Every divine promise
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; you're in reach of it, sis.
[2:17:54] You too, buddy. Let me tell you
[2:17:56] something.
[2:17:59] Even the little children came up and
[2:18:02] they could grab. Sometimes it's easier
[2:18:04] for you little children to grab a hold
[2:18:06] of it than some of us adults because
[2:18:09] we've had too much experience.
[2:18:13] But it's been experienced the wrong way.
[2:18:15] But you are within reach, sweetheart,
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; of every divine promise that God has
[2:18:22] made.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:27] You don't have to be the be the deacon.
[2:18:32] You don't have to be the one running the
[2:18:34] sound system.
[2:18:38] But every one of us is within reach
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; of every promise of God. Every divine
[2:18:45] promise, sister, you've got a right to
[2:18:48] take a hold of it.
[2:18:59] You see what I'm doing? It's not about
[2:19:01] the bottle.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to put a face
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; on the promise of God. Amen.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Hand it back there and let him.
[2:19:22] And you've got a right
[2:19:25] as a son and daughter of God. Take that
[2:19:28] bottle home with you.
[2:19:37] It ain't a bottle.
[2:19:40] It ain't a prayer cloth.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; It's the God
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; that we're trusting in. Amen. Amen.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't ever put your your
[2:19:52] confidence in, oh, if if this brother
[2:19:55] prays for me, if that brother lays hands
[2:19:57] on me, if that sister takes my my name
[2:20:01] into her prayer closet. No, our
[2:20:04] confidence is in the Lord. We don't
[2:20:07] defeat the enemy with a water bottle or
[2:20:10] with a prayer cloth. We defeat the enemy
[2:20:13] with the word of God.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. that God's word can never fail.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; It's here for us.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; It's here for us because God had a plan.
[2:20:31] And God's plan,
[2:20:34] I know we're going to a place.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come up if they would.
[2:20:43] We're going to a place where there's not
[2:20:45] going to be any more sorrow.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; We sing a song. I'm going to a city
[2:20:53] where the roses never fade.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, here they bloom but for a season. Of
[2:21:00] course, right now when it's just fixing
[2:21:02] to be b bear trees, but they're the
[2:21:05] prettiest that they'll be all year long
[2:21:07] right now.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, them maples are gorgeous out here. I
[2:21:11] saved some of them on the way in.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; But you know what?
[2:21:18] We
[2:21:21] It's not going to take death.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be some of us
[2:21:29] that are alive and remain
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; and we're not going to hinder those that
[2:21:35] have already gone on before.
[2:21:40] But we're going to rise and meet them.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; They'll come up first and we're going to
[2:21:49] come right up with them.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; How beautiful
[2:21:59] the heaven
[2:22:01] must be.
[2:22:06] Sweet home
[2:22:09] of the high
[2:22:11] and free.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; It's a sweet heaven
[2:22:19] of rest
[2:22:21] for the river.
[2:22:26] Oh, how beautiful
[2:22:29] heaven
[2:22:31] must be.
[2:22:34] Amen.
[2:22:39] I don't know if I remembered it all or
[2:22:41] not. Why don't y'all just stand up with
[2:22:44] me for a minute?
[2:22:47] I hope that everybody's heart got
[2:22:50] cleared out last night. If there's
[2:22:52] anybody here with us this morning that
[2:22:55] you know that you are not in sync with
[2:22:58] the Lord Jesus, just why don't you just
[2:23:01] confess it to him and turn it all over
[2:23:05] to him
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; because there's something I want you to
[2:23:09] know that I've got.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Do I have pain sometimes? Yeah, I do.
[2:23:18] But you know what I've got?
[2:23:21] I've got something. Do y'all have that
[2:23:24] song? It is joy unspeakable.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; If y'all pull it up for me because as a
[2:23:32] musician a lot of times I remember the
[2:23:35] chords better than I remember the words.
