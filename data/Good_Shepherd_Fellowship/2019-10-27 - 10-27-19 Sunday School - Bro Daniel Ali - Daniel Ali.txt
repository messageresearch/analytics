========================================
it is not by power but by your spirit and we are trusting in you for data put your trust in you would never be later would never be put to shame we are holding on and we'll keep holding on because we know you would have made a promise you are more than able to bring it to pass we're just thinking we worship the father this morning and we bless thee with all our has or God may you come dear Lord Jesus and breathe over your word this morning or get a reward as father in any way it places t any jesus name amen praise God so looking at prayer [Music] yesterday there was a prayer request that was sent around for sister race I hope we'll be getting an update this morning and this morning yes as I was getting ready to come to church my mind was just going from one to the other then I tore off his quiche then I said now sister is and her baby and it was just not a voice like I'm talking to you but I could hear now is because God has confidence in you as a church to handle the problem praise be to God because God has confidence in us as a church though we can't deal with a problem like that so he allows it to come praise be to God wonderful you know I was just thinking even at wait when your boss begins to give you a lot of weight it shows how much confidence the boss has seen you accept in a situation where you can tell that the boss doesn't like you there probably he wants to kill you but we know that the god we are seven loves us he has not even thought against us constraining us matter of peace wishing that above all things we should prosper in the taste of God praise be to God so when he allows things to come praise be to God it shows how much confidence God has in us that we can handle it if this little group here can attract that there was attention and for the devil to start throwing tests at us it showed that by the grace of God we are doing something right don't care about what the devil is doing keep your eyes on the promises of God praise be to God wonderful last week we took a few readings let's just read from Mach 11 mark 11:23 mark 11:23 mark 11:23 yes so let's take you from 22 and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast and be thou cast into the sea and shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith praise be to God verse 24 therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye have received them and ye shall have them wonderful praise be to God last week I took a quote from the prophet from the message being led by the spirit and I just want to start from there today now what did I tell you last night talking about the woman in Germany whom he prayed for when the light is gone out it has to shrink the woman had a grater and the prophet just sprayed with her told her to measure it every day when the life is gone out it has to shrink now sister that will be like that for three days and three nights it may get worse don't worry that's a sign that you are healed just keep rain just keep giving praise to God when I come back to Germany come and testify whatever wherever I am I'll pray I'll pay away you will see what the Lord can do and I remember we talked about that when the situation gets worse is a sign that God has answered your prayer most of the times after preyas we just want to feel fine right away which is good we all love that but sometimes it doesn't happen that way sometimes the situation gets worse than it was before the prayer the prophet of God is saying that it is a sign that God has answered your prayer the devil all that the devil is looking for when the pain goes up when tis begin to get Wes is for you to just bring out something negative if you can just doubt within that moment of time oh I thought I was healed guess what you have destroyed your testimony but keep holding on and never give up praise be to God now in the message what shall I do with Jesus called Christ after adding this to my notes I thought sure I've even printed them separately so since faith could adhere but bear with me what well that's what's making the little woman get worse many times I've explained it if you get worse does a very sign that you are here you see and so it was just getting worse all the time and choking hey cause it was swollen but it had to let loose the life was gone out of it and have coffee like that you see where Abraham coughs like that sprung pulled it loose from the rest of her body her flesh and the dead substance just the body with no life in it the concern gone jumped out she fled out still talking about when things get worse is a sign that is getting better praise be to God in the message believe in God if someone comes up and puts it around opposite on you if somebody around here don't some kind of as something to you unless you get well it doesn't inspire you it doesn't inspire you I remember back home we have a lot of hay ballasts there are people that are just good at it they almost have every remedy for any condition you mentioned this and they will go to the bush take these leaves take this leaves dig this root and then they bring it to you and then they ask you cook drink it and then you drink it and see that all you are getting better it doesn't inspire you you are happy when that happens that oh I will see or I had pain back tell god I am fine now you are happy but it doesn't inspire that's what a prophet is talking about you see but but here is what it is he that believeth I am healed now if God come down and healed me positive write out a miracle it would be it wouldn't be as great as it would be if I can see the promise of God and take it into my heart now let me just spend a minute here if I am sick and I pray oh I am being prayed for and I'm healed that is a great aim that is a great thing my brother branham is saying that it will not be as great as you taking the word in into your heart I'm going to read further then we'll talk about this it wouldn't be as great as it would be if I can see the promise of God and take it into my heart stand there and I can say Jesus is now healing me Jesus is now healing me have accepted his word it's in my heart he is now interceding for me before the Father I shall be well praise be to God there is what God loves standing on his wait and see it's right he is healing me now every day that was the one woman with a goiter I can see I just give her something to do so it disappeared we didn't want any at all but she was happy said oh look look and the next day it was about that much then the next day it was about that much the greater was just shrinking and shrinking because what she was holding on to the word and believe in the word that the word was healing her so the word was actually performing she put it all together said that can't be wrong praise be to God that can't be wrong I can't find one of my nose now whichever way we are going to pull through this morning praise be to God now so when you are being playful or when you pray believe do not wait until you see resolves before you believe that God has answered your prayer it's not wrong to wait before you see results but that is not free fred is you believing that it's done and based on your feet you see the physical manifestation of the result so the point of God is saying that there is nothing like you touching the weight and then standing on the way and believing God to perform there is nothing that inspires more than that and he is saying that God loves it to see that you have taken his right into your heart and you have taken your position you don't care what the I see you don't care what the body is going through you don't care the pain when you just take your position and you believe that God is watching even though you have not seen anything yet now just look at egg take an egg I'm not talking of a table egg the poultry eggs we buy know that has no life in it I am talking of those eggs those chicken in the countryside on a free-range they ex delay the eggs those eggs have life in them now when a hand begins to lay it less and less and less probably up to 10 15 20 eggs and they to stop lane and then it would go and then sit on these eggs to hatch them now what I know is that it takes 21 days for the for the four day for the eggs to hatch into chickens 21 days every day counts when their hand sits on the eggs the first 24 hours if you go and then you take one of those eggs and you break it you wouldn't see anything you wouldn't see anything you wouldn't notice anything but I assure you that something has already began taking place there number two you can go for another egg and break it you wouldn't see anything it will just be ordinary egg but something is going through something is happening after day number seven when you break one egg again you will see egg but at that point in time something is not really very right with a egg but you will not see a chicken but the process has already began for everyday their hand goes and it will sit on the eggs when it's hungry it will run out just look for food and come right back and sit on the eggs what is it doing it's just providing that environment for the hand I mean for the chickens to develop week number two if you take one egg and you break it now you see oh it's no longer the liquid egg but there is something in it it's not fully formed yet but there is something in it that is what happens when you take in the word of God and you believe the Word of God and you stand on the promises of the Word of God something begins to happen it may take you 24 hours it may take you a year it might take you 10 years 20 years to see the result but something right away begins to happen right away and as the hand sits on the eggs and the eggs develop into chase now it's fully developed the chicken is inside it looks around so what I'm a chick where there is a shell around me what do I do the mother would never break would never break that eggshell to bring the chicken out there is that chicken inside which is harmless beak would begin to peck at a wall of the egg the shell get to peck and then breaks it forces itself and then it comes out but one time it was an egg so God brings you to that place you know when you hear the word there is life in the Word of God taking in the way where is that atmosphere it brings you to that asthma it just create that atmosphere around you well God can easily step in and then perform and as you hold on to the promises of God and you keep believing and you keep believing and you keep believing everyday you believe something takes place every day you believe something takes place until finally you got to that place and you know that oh this is it praise be to God there is nothing that can be compared to that but a Branham is saying God loves it so whatever you are trusting God for keep holding to the word do not let your faith waver keep holding and keep believing something is happening already it's just a matter of time and it will be open to this eyes will be open to it pres beauty card now in the message still believing in God where a brother talks about this about a woman that was sick and for a very long time there was no help let me just read this I just don't know why the time is running so fast the doctor couldn't do nothing about her so the young man come up there the pasta and prayed for the elderly woman and laid his hands on her according to James according to much system they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he came up and laid his hands upon upon the woman a few days she was up and going about her wake as well and and was well when her so retained from the college why he was so happy you know he sees his mother so happy said how are you getting along mother the mother says just fine said Oh son I forgot to tell you something while you was away these four years said I got sick and you know mrs. so-and-so over here belongs to the Full Gospel Church said her posture come up and laid hands on me according to mark 16 and I got well said the doctor couldn't do nothing for me when I had that sick spell how that's how I got well he said well murder now the son speaking murder I want to inform you something cuz I went to college with Landis the last nine verses of Marxist teen isn't inspired said that was put in there by the Vatican there is no history that says that that word in there is a spite and a little who must said praise God praise God he said what's the matter with you mother she said if God could heal me with worse that isn't inspired what could he do with that which is inspired praise be to God if he can heal me with uninspired ways what will he do with the way that is inspired you see the devil would do anything to attack the way the integrity of the word anything the devil would do and why they were doing that for you to lose courage in the world for you to lose confidence in the world anything he would do but that didn't stop the woman now I have to look for my next page I hope the devil didn't hide it anywhere great hmm that's interesting I printed two pages of 110 Oh probably's here yes I got it yes so there is life in the Word of God and whatever the devil would loo would do to make sure you lose confidence in the word he would do it because he knows that when you believe in the word and you stand on the promises of God nothing can hold you back we are just four minutes away I knew I was not going to finish this but you know what let me just put this in I want to make good use of my time whenever you pray that is what I have us I want us to have in the back of our minds today that whenever you pray believe that something has already happened there was a story about a sailor who would pray before he starts his journey and for years the Pyrus wanted to track him down and they couldn't they would see him and as they got closer something happens and they would lose sight of him they followed you for years he didn't even know there was anything happening but one day the Paras caught up with him and when they tracked him down and took him they asked him a question it's a who are you what are you coming from where are you going we have been tracking you for years and we have never caught you how come today we found you he himself was surprised then he suddenly began to think he said Oh for the first time in years I forgot to pray for the first time in years I forgot to pray better till then he probably may have thought that maybe it was becoming it was just a routine or maybe I mean let me just pray for the sake of preyas no it is not so for the first time I forgot to pray so that meant that for every time he prayed something happened but he didn't have the eyes to see and he didn't know there was anything going on it was like those two fishes I once talked about here one prayed and said father opened my eyes to see my enemies the other one said you know what just protect me the Wonder said open my eyes to see my enemies oh when he dived into the sea he saw that the fisherman had a net ready for him he said no way he went this way he saw a very big hook waiting for him he said no way he went this way he saw a shock with a mouth open why did you swallow it I said no way the fish kept on running from pillar to post tell a died of hunger but you know the one that prayed and said father protect me it will swim and swim and swim and get into the fish net and I realized oh something has caught me I know to just shake yourself and then is going through it swims and then it enters in today fish are they enter the mouth of the shock it doesn't even know it's in the mouth of the shock and then you seems you soon see and the shock will open his mouth and to swim out not even realizing what went on whenever you will pray something happens keep believing in the promise of God whatever it is that you are trusting God for he is more than able to do it praise be to God it's unfortunately putting Andy's know there is not enter this but or something I actually wanted to get to today but praise be to God which has to do with the weight and believe in our time is up praise be to guard shall we pray our Lord and our Savior Jesus we are so grateful now the Lord our God is a life that our God is not dead we thank you dear Lord Jesus that you reign and you reign in the life of your children and with you in our midst nothing can go wrong we thank you Lord for some of the storms we have to go through for you I love them father for a purpose we may not like it when we are going through the storms but when
