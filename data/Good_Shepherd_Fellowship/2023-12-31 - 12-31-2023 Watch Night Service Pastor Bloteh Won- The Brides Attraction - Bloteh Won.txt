uh you know I was I was listening to uh uh the news and and uh uh they were talking about you know people uh trying to close the year because for some reason the the T first count out one two3 one two3 so many people love that one two3 one two3 and and uh and so many are trying to do their wedding today before the next year so they can have it on one to3 one to3 I don't know what it means to

Thanksgiving we will bless him tonight oh bless the name of the Lord amen thinking about one of my favorite song but it's not coming to my mind so thank you musicians and uh we we will just go right into the word tonight praise the Lord we'll go into the word tonight like I said we will want to try to make this uh a prayer meeting tonight a meeting of Thanksgiving and just pouring our hearts to the Lord committing our s in his hands praying for one another praying for the different families that's what we want to do tonight and uh uh uh more than uh let's read uh Genesis chapter 3 we spoke about the woman seed this morning and uh but let's go back to Genesis chapter 3 while I was aw I was I was over there in the in the guest house I think it was a guest house they had me in and I was I was listening to a message and and uh just trying to relax my mind for the next service and then something struck me on this thought and I thought well maybe that could be a good thing to speak on on the 31st night so uh Genesis chapter 3 let's read verse 15 and 16 and I will put emoy between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heat now just like I said this morning with Isaiah prophecy uh it's supposed to be the Virgin because if you look into Matthew when Matthew quoted Isaiah he corrected that he never said a virgin he said the Virgin shall conceive so when we look back here we see the same thing and I will put emity between thee and not a woman but their woman and between thy seed and her seed and they shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his head unto the woman he said I will great multiply th sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shall bring forth children and thy desire shall be to the thy husband and he shall rule over thee th desire shall be to the husband and he shall rule over thee now with that phrase tonight that desire shall be to their husand and he will rule over the and and uh that's what I want to take my my thoughts from tonight to to preach on attraction I want to preach on attraction because I talk about the word attraction and then when I look at the meaning attraction is a feeling of interest is a desire or closeness towards someone so that desire shall be to the husband and he shall rule over thee let's go to St John 12: 32 in John 12:32 St John chap 12 verse 32 let's read from verse 30 just to be able to grab a little context of uh of uh the chapter there Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for thy sake now is the Judgment of this word now is the Judgment of this word now shall the prise of this word be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me praise the Lord and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me let's pray together Heavenly Father dear Lord Jesus We Want to Thank You Lord we want to thank you I'm so grateful father that you have given us this opportunity to come together Lord father this is the last day of this year you have been so good to us Des part of all of the things that we have dealed with all of the things that we went through you have been good to us Lord you have been good to us and we just appreciate you Father for giving us this time Lord that we can come together as your children with many of the Saints many of your people many of your children Gathering Together around the world to give thanks to you father here we are in this little group tonight Lord bringing our thanks and appreciation to you for your blessings upon us this year we have this little words that we have read uh before us tonight we just want to pray that God you would come give us inspiration oh Father give us Lord father God and just set us aside use us oh God as an oracle of you that father we will say something that will be able to encourage your children tonight we love you we appreciate you father in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you the Lord bless you now I remember now I remember I was I was thinking about uh uh uh that song we we normally sing if it if if it had never been for the Lord on my side tell me where would I be where would I be if it had M been for the Lord on my side tell me where would I be where would I be yeah that was the song that was on my mind thank you for helping me with uh the the acapella version amen praise the lord well just like we said this morning uh uh we are very grateful and uh I'm not just saying it because they are words but we are very grateful that uh we have this little body of Believers people that uh uh we believe that are standing standing together to be able to push the name of Jesus Christ from this little place amen we are very very grateful as a church we have had our shares of trouble we have had our shares of trouble we have uh uh went through all sorts of different things but yet we have stay together we have stay on the the co and of of Jesus Christ we are stayed together tonight so we are very very very grateful and I know many of the Saints couldn't make it and some are following the service tonight uh even the S down from uh MTO they are following the service tonight and different ones so we greet every one of you and uh we will remember brother Wesley and sister Carrick over there in Illinois and uh following the service too we want to greet them brother Mark Wilson down in wona and we want to also greet him and I heard a greetings from Brother Juan herandez and uh we we also want to to greet our brother if he's following the service tonight uh we miss brother one uh as as few of us know uh he's uh he's been uh uh going through uh a Chang in his life he you know uh been coming short of his memory so uh uh he's been advised to stay close to home so uh and I I spoke to him told him I think that's that's okay with me and uh in know Al brother Steven be and and all the different ones brother Andrew sister Christin told me they they will be the way this weekend and uh so I think uh uh they either in service or following the service tonight but tonight this word attraction kind of uh uh hit me and uh uh tonight I want to I want to speak on the bride's attraction but because it's the end of the year I want to also ask a question because when I taught on the the word attraction I also taught on the message what is the attraction on the mountain and uh we we will now talk about the attraction on the mountain tonight I want to I want to actually ask a question what is our attraction for 2024 what is attracting us to 2024 praise the Lord and uh before we start guessing in our mind the bride's attraction for 2024 is the rapture is the coming of the Lord now I'm not saying the coming of the Lord is 2024 I want to be clear on tape praise the Lord but the bright attraction for 2024 is the rapture and uh uh you will you will see why I say that as we get into our talk tonight now we see we living in such a time we're living in such a time where we realize that uh uh Satan has uh uh uh a a diversion uh and different devices and different things that he's doing today distract us amen they're just out of there to distract us but the bride attraction is the word the Fulfillment of the word when God is bringing his word to pass that's what attract us amen when God is bringing his word to pass in our life in the life life of another brother in the life of another sister that should be our attraction praise the Lord and uh uh but we see that's where the greater battle is is to get us away from that attraction and the devil use his distraction and it becomes an attraction to Us Praise the Lord with with all of the things that is happening around us you know and and and most especially with uh this age that we are we are in this kind of uh virtual age that we are in Praise the Lord and uh uh with all of those things so we we want to look at this together tonight I pray that I will be able to find the grace to to to deliver it as uh as a f inspired uh just uh steuding and and thinking about this attraction is a feeling of Interest a desire or closeness towards someone and yet we see that uh uh uh God is speaking to Eve uh talking about the seed of the woman and all of that and let me say this there is something that is that is becoming you know so so clearer to me than than ever before just like when we read there in Deuteronomy chapter 23 about uh you know uh bastor shall not come into the congregation of the Lord what I beginning to realize as I look into the scripture and the and the message of the hour I realize that uh God placed a lot of things in his word in the form of a prophecy God expressed his thoughts let let's let's make let's let's uh give an example when he was telling Moses to build a tabernacle like the faction in heaven now he took Moses on the mountain and uh and he told him to build the Tabernacle and just like as he have seen in heaven now but we realize that that Tabernacle that Moses was building it was just an expression of this Tabernacle that you and myself are because we have to realize that God just like in Genesis Genesis chapter 1 when God was creating everything when he was creating everything he started from the least form of life and to the highest form of life and God only got rest when he made a Man In His Image praise the Lord God only got rest he took rest to himself when he was able to achieve to have a man In His Image now so that is the same thing God we have to realize that his his ultimate desire was to come from a thought form was to come from a spirit form let me say it that way from being an invisible God to be visible praise the Lord so God highest desire that was in his heart was to be made flesh yes that everything he have ever Tau of in his mind should be expressed in a visible form so even when he when he told Moses to build a tabernacle according to the vision he saw in heaven Moses built a tabernacle and the glory of God came down but what God was Desiring what actually he was Desiring was to have a body that he could D in Praise the Lord he says the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my for stone there is no building that will contain me but a body will that prepare me are we together so when you look at the Old Testament prophets you look at the Old Testament you will see that and in many places God was just expressing his thoughts what he was going to achieve he put it in the form of ordinance and statutes in in in the Old Testament and as we follow the principle we realize that it is all about God yes and not about us that's one thing about about the gospel one thing about the word of God is all God center it's all God Center he said my glory I will share with no man it's all God centered and that is the that is the success of the church if the church can be all God Center that would be the success of of our life if we will ever get to the place where it will be all God centered he said when I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me praise the Lord the picture will start Bec coming h h h h blurred and and and getting D when you start putting yourself in the picture but if you leave it all God Center you're going to see it more clearer right praise the Lord hallelujah and uh uh so that's that's one of the thing and I say there because when you look at this prophecy over here and God speaking to the woman your desire will be to your husband is it's so easy for us to get our eyes from the big picture of the prophecy and bring it to ourself it's so easy for me to tell my wife the Bible say your desire will be to your husband praise the Lord but you see what happened there is that if I do that I exclude myself out of the prophecy and I I leave the prophecy for her alone that is the danger I kick myself off the prophecy because I'm seeing that okay she's the wife I'm the husand your desire will be to your husand right but you see this this this is a more bigger thought God had a more broader thought than just for our our human desire our fleshly desire our mind desire it has a place for the Natural Woman it also has a place for the spiritual church amen amen are we together but there is a more bigger picture there praise the Lord there is a more bigger and broader picture when we look at that that desire will be to your husband and he will have the ru over you glor glory be to God hallelujah amen now so as we look at this thought together tonight let me read few things that uh that I was able to gather here in the message inspiration brother bandam says the greatest attraction the word has ever had when Christ be lifted up to a fallen word that is the greatest attraction the word has ever had that Christ will be lifted up to a fallen word praise the Lord he also said Jesus said when he was here on Earth if I be lifted up I would draw all men unto me black white yellow brown whatever the color or race is the gospel still holds the center of attraction to every man and every woman praise the Lord amen the gospel still holds the center of Attraction now follow me in that line of thought now to see what I'm getting to the gospel stay holds the center of Attraction he goes on again and says here in the message the truth and false Vine he says to my opinion the gospel never losses attraction to the believer it's always the same gospel are we together the gospel never lost attraction to the believer it is the same gospel Hallelujah now so when I when I look at this when I look at this because uh uh uh uh uh there's a picture piure in my mind and and as soon as you can grapp it the service will be over tonight uh I promise you praise the Lord and I'm trying to bring it out the best way I can so you can be able to grab it now because when you look at this most of the time we we it almost looks like uh uh uh uh you have to realize that that the the the H the way we have buil uh uh uh we we are able to to describe things or see things either uh in a form or shape all with a color the best way we can be able to describe something you either say is white or you say it's like a square it's it's either takes a form of a shape or you know or a color our our our our senses of seeing is designed that way for and and that's how things get our attention praise the Lord but here in the mess Ching of a bride he also says he says this here he says the church has become in these days with its achievement and all other manmade achievement is becoming scientific they are trying to make a scientific Church by the attraction of pictures and great steeple now just like I said that's that's the thing that aeach to the human sense of seeing okay if either uh uh I mean nothing against it I mean if if the Lord ever bless us with a church that have a great staple we will love it but you see that's that is the way that the human eyes I mean it has to be uh a building and a cross on top as soon as you see it you say that's a church right it takes that description or maybe like we have in the front of our church Good Shepherd Good Shepherd Fellowship as soon as you see it if if a person ever have any sense of the Bible Good Shepherd oh yeah good Shepherd Jesus is the Good Shepherd so that's the church right you see the church like brother B is saying the church in its approach in its achievement has taken a scientific approach by either attracting people by the building or by the words that we put on it now if you realize now you go around you will see there are many churches that have this electronic sign board like I said nothing wrong with right amen if I have the money we will put one out there right and we put our owner message it just be coming up and down nothing wrong with it but what I'm trying to bring to your mind is that that is the church on the approach of attracting people right God approach of attracting people is his word amen are we together am God way of attracting us is his Worden praise the Lord and the truth about the matter there is there you you get attracted to the word because of what God put in you the thing that magnetize you that attracts you to the word is not your senses no it's the seed of God that is in you praise the Lord because men with uh with with with education and and and degrees they can read this very same word and they get so confused to them the Bible just contrad itself all over the place but you can take the word and read it and it's just an amen thank you Jesus oh glory be to God oh Lord Jesus you are wonderful praise the Lord because men thinks the thing that will attract them today is to go to Bible school or to get a high learning you see we we we we are trying to make our attraction away from us that's what I want to I want us to be able to grab tonight we are making our attraction away from us he said our attraction will be to our husband the the husband is not different from the wife actually with a covenant of marriage they are one right are we [Music] together so we realize that that prophecy is more is more beyond our our sexual desire our fleshly desire God was bringing us up to a higher calling the church in his scientific achievement have made great stles highrise building just make just make it in a in a V shape put a cross to the top or we just put you know a whole Bible verse on our building anybody come and read it they know straight that this is a church right praise the Lord amen amen amen if you go right at the back of the building there before you get out there uh you will see some kind of a cross standing the uh right on nail to the building I P that day I asked a brother to do that and I took white tape and taped the wood just to make it white praise the Lord it sound funny to you amen because many times sometimes I you know I I I stay right here and and people comes to see me and I say come right to the to the stop sign when you drive down a sister now right to the stop sign the church is on your right they come they drive down they says oh I didn't see a church I said right to the stop sign when you get to the stop sign the fourway stop sign the church is right across there I said okay I know what I'll do I need to put a cross on this building so when they come they see the white crow oh yeah okay this is is the church brother Bram say is our scientific way of attracting people are you getting the idea it's our scientific way it's man way praise the Lord because God's word is that he don't look at the building to be the church is the people the beauty of the church is the character of the [Music] people amen amen yes sir are we grapping the picture amen are you seeing what I'm driving to tonight so our attraction is not the flashy things around us right those things are more distraction yes our attraction is the thing that God is doing amen amen amen in the corner of our heart the thing that he's doing in the corner of our heart dealing with our conscience because that's the thing that has more value praise the Lord amen amen I'm not going to take the time to blast social media tonight and uh none of that but we see all of the things you know that uh that happen on social media if we if you have one you see all the comparison and you see all the things that people uh you know and and and uh which of course with with the statistics it have puted this generation into crisis right many young people have got so disturbed by their minds because of the pictures of other that you see on on Facebook and different social media Tik Tok and what what what out of you why because to them it looks like an attraction it looks like other are having great achievement and it seems to be attracted to that right why can't we go on the trip why can't we go scar diving right praise the Lord why can't we go and you know and and and all of that and and and uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and and and and and and all of those things are appealing to the to the to the mind they want us to to to kind of for work hard and save money and uh uh uh so one day we can scar da or or or one day we can get on a cruise ship and or one day we can you know and and as as we see those things because they appearal to our eyes right we get attracted to that and right away we start Gathering Zeal and strength and thought to be able to want to do it even if we have to fake it it becomes appealing yeah you see what you see what I'm getting to yeah it looks like we are attracted to that but actually in a real sense it's a distraction praise the Lord if we just take it in a common sense for you know to help our young people to understand it's a distraction because for the matter of fact that is that you were never thinking about that until you saw that picture right praise the Lord you had your own agenda you had your own plans and and there were things that you wanted to do with your life and things you wanted to but now because something has come up on on on on Amazon or on YouTube or whatever wherever it have come up you saw it in the magazine or somebody spoke about it in school it starts to play with your mind and now it looks like you are attracted to that sure praise the Lord and every other thing that you that you you have planed to do you want you you just want to get rid of it and and I I just want to make sure that I have that all the boys are doing it or all the girls are doing it or I think it would be a fun thing when that person was saying man I was just imagine in my mind what will happen right praise the Lord that is more destruction than an attraction praise the Lord if an attraction is a feeling of Interest praise the Lord amen if an attraction is a feeling of Interest or a desire and you realize there are uh if I should see someone doing certain thing or dressing or whatever it is and I will be able to you know forget about my owner program and want to be like that person you realize that it's a distraction are we together is a distraction the promise here is that my desire will be to him and he will have the road over me praise the Lord our attraction will be to him and he will have the road over us so like I said from the beginning what is attracting us what what what is the attraction of uh 2024 let me read some few things here again as I try to to build myself together invisible Union see another example here that uh I just wonder we are always telling of the Beauty and the attraction of the church but we fail to tell them he that will follow me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me I wonder if we hav't made the beauty of the church too pretty for the fellow that comes in praise the Lord now brother Bram is also using this sense to say how are we attracting people to the Lord what are we using right praise the Lord are we saying well that church is a Liberian church and when you go there you fear at home because there there's a bunch of liberians there all that church you he people people said it's a black church sure you know they played you know black gospel so he's using this s to say how are we attracting what what are we using to attract people to church right praise the lord we realize that on the days of Pentecost and like brother Bon was say Peter Paul a a a soap box down and he claim on that Soap Box and he started preaching the gospel and said men and breens let this be known unto you that we are not drunk but this is the promise that joah spoke about praise the Lord and the Bible says when he testified when he point the people to the promise of the Old Testament that have been fulfilled he pointed the people to a fulfillment of Prophecy are you seeing it's a fulfillment of Prophecy it was what God was doing in that mov and the Bible says after he finished preaching the hearts of the people were moved and they said what can we do to be safe praise the Lord he never pointed the people to a history you know we were on the boat with Jesus and he told me I should cast my net praise the Lord as truth as that story is amen as truth as the story is it was just not enough to capture the minds of the people it could look more like a man is building up taals but Peter was able to attract the people and bring their mind to the fulfilling of scripture in his day that's God attraction you love all through the Bible amen All Through the Bible how did God got the attention of Moses it was a fulfillment of scripture he told Abraham I will come down in the mighty I will come down amen and I will bring them out with a mighty hands and have the God came down in the burning bush he came down in the burning bush and that burning bush created an attraction for Moses there is nothing that have a drawing power than the fulfilling of God's word praise the Lord just talking about the story of how the seven Angel come down it's beautiful right but what is it all about what was it about yeah are you getting the picture you look all through the scripture whenever God was about to fulfill his word that fulfilling of the word always cause an attraction it create a desire amen it created an interest Moses was at the back of backside of the desert with his steak he has already chosen a a new career to follow sheeps but when God attracted him with the burning bush it created a new interest in his heart he said I'm going to Egypt to take over glory be to God Amen oh how I desire and and if I will wish you a happy New Year the best wishes I can give to you is look for the Fulfillment of God's word as you go into the coming year let the Fulfillment of God's will be your attraction let it be the thing that will catch your attention let us be looking around for scriptures that will be fulfilled Even in our lives in the lives of our children because this promise is unto you and unto your children Hallelujah and as many as the Lord Our God shall called Praise the Lord oh as as as much as we love the design of the newest car that comes out we love it praise the lord we appreciate you know uh the the latest cell phone we appreciate all the invasion of science but they are not our attraction they are not our attraction we can look at it and say wow that's nice praise the Lord amen because the truth of the matter there is that some of us will have it some of us will never have it sure we would just admire it from Far praise the Lord amen amen we would just admire it from Far wishing that we can have it sure what is the brightest attraction our desire our attraction will be to the word praise the Lord our attraction will be to the word and that's how the word will have preeminence in our lives praise the Lord that's how the word will have prein if you if you look at uh uh uh uh the life of Daniel there in Babylon the Bible says he searched book he read the book of Jeremiah and the SW of aai and all of these prophecy because he had a burden concerning his people praise the Lord he was attracted to find out what what is going to happen to us praise the Lord amen if you realize let me just let me just hit one reality you one reality if you realize many years ago before we have all the uh the MP3 you know uh even the the CD and all of that you will see that uh even even even the days of the Bible before I come to the message even the days of the Bible before uh uh uh Luther came with his Revival because it was right in that time the printing press came public right at a time where the Holy Spirit was was anointing Luther to bring the message of the judge shall live by faith it was around the same time that the printing press got their explosion right but before then the Saints of old they were able to memorize that chapter not verses they could memorize an entire book because the Bible was not in public like that right if a person had just one sheet of the Bible it was a treasure it was a Tre me and at the very same time the Catholic church was burning people to the stake if you have a copy of the Bible because they never wanted it to be in the hands of the people and someone will tell you oh I find I I find the Book of Matthew a person may spend the whole night off writing the Book of Matthew because they got to give that book back to the owner if they want their own Book of Matthew they spend the whole night or writing just writing thank you thank you brother amen WR in the Book of Matthew yes praise the Lord that's how precious the word of God was to those people they will stay up they will memorize they will memorize until you tell the person about uh h h h uh uh uh you know the way that a father will be able to read the Bible to his children is what he memorized amen he's reading St John to his children he's memorizing I'm not memorizing I'm reading from right here but he's talking to his family then Jesus 6 days before the Passover he's not reading from a book He's reading from his mind because the word was so precious precious in the sense that it was scarce right praise the Lord but when the printing press came open and the words start becoming public and the people had the Bible all in their hands this word that was so precious that now they could I mean that before they could memorize now they have it in their hands there was no time to memorize they put it right on the Shelf bring that Bible down let's look let's look for St John right praise the Lord now they have access to it it's all on the Shelf it's all taking dust pretty soon the same thing is happening to us there was a time word the spoken word was not in great publication we never had all of the tapes right it was so precious I know I know I know my days it was not many years ago but we didn't have many messages I mean we flip s books from one person to another praise the Lord and sometime when you want be you want to be so mean you keep it to yourself and you got to keep it very well that nobody see you have it praise the Lord it was so scarce until we were stealing we were stealing s book praise the Lord yeah I don't know whether you call it stealing or not but I I will tell you I'll tell you maybe pet have a knowledge of this brother uh this brother they had they had a bunch of sems that came down from Brother har H Bryan so there were two brothers that were leading leading the church at the time brother Malachi and brother Alex most of the brother were all attached to brother Malachi you know he was he was our primary uh leader pastor at that time and Alex was just a quiet guy L by he was looking like the assistant pastor so I I saw that all of these guys everybody's is running to the leader so I talk friend with the other guy you know I will go to his house you know uh uh you know and and and clean his room and pack his book I will arrange his book and while I'm arranging the book when I see two caret I pull one down and P one on the Shelf one down and one on the Shelf one down how I would build in my own library because the books were just catter all over the place praise the Lord and I remember one one day he came he he says he said wow man he says you know he says he said well thank you thank you brother all the guys and they can just take books see how you pack the thing nicely I pack it nicely for my interest well if I when I park it nicely it was for my own interest praise the Lord it sounding funny to you a praise praise the Lord amen I mean we we were buying we were buying exercise book exercise copy book to pretty much write write quotes you you read a message if if there's a quot that that that struck you you write it down right praise the Lord yeah but now we have it on our phone praise the lord we have it on our phone and it's not just four five books we have on our phone we have the entire Library yes we have every every almost every translation of the Bible every translation of the Bible I I even have the Quran in English on my phone because sometimes I'm interested to look into certain things and we have all of these great resources now if you compare this time that we are living in with with with with uh with the vi uh benefit and and an exploit of Technology even to the very same time of the printing press just so imagine that now the Bible is is is h i mean the Bible that the people could not even look upon now it has come in print do you realize how how precious it was to the homes of the believer praise the Lord until the father will not want for you to put anything on the Bible right he will want you to put anything on the Bible it was so precious but slowly that preciousness started getting away from the people the word that was precious now start becoming common it start becoming common because we have NIV we have good news we have King James King James language is too high we have we have uh Revis version praise the Lord until now they want to give us an L ltbg or what tbg Bible the word that was so precious is now becoming so common it's becoming so common and when it becomes so common like this it loses value that we can we can argue I love this translation over this translation this translation said it's explain amplifier says this this this this it gave more brother it just attract I mean distraction the commonness of the word what is it doing it's just dividing us we argue we fuss with one another we are not edifying one another when the word was precious a person would read bro come and see come and I read something today man come and see yeah bro when you fin reading that book give it to me it was precious praise the Lord but when it becomes common what happened I I I I read no let me read it in NIV that thing you reading you know because the King James that were King J language that King J language is too high let me read it in NV let me break it down and I'll read it in the good news which is the Catholic H H setting of a Bible as as as all the publication and the printing increased is we hearing different names of all the different printing it looks like it's an attraction even sometimes you know the the design on the Bible they make it classet they put it in the bag you can you can zip it on you can zip it in some is partable you can fit it right in your bag I mean it taking a shap and form right but you see it's not creating an attraction it creating a lot of distraction because now we can argue about wor we can def with with with with definition right so when you bring it even to our age and and and and all of the invention that is around us praise the Lord all of the invention that is around us as much as they are there to make life a little bit easy for us but they are also there creating a lot of distruction a lot of distraction praise the Lord a lot of distraction a common example you buy your phone praise the Lord you start to figure out all the Futures on your phone you you you have not gone even half the new the new version has come up you have not finished figuring out all the future what this phone can do for me right you have not finished you just in the middle at the time where you think you have kept it a new one has come up your phone is outdated praise the Lord or they say oh that a new phone you can just look at you can put it to your face it take the back of take the picture on your [Music] back praise the Lord then the phone that is in your hand now you just think that it's is outdated the interest of discovering this phone has gone because a new version has come up is that an attraction no it's a distraction you really wanted to get this phone now now just bear with me now I'm trying to bring you to my picture I'm not disc discover discouraging you on your phones I'm just trying to bring you to be able to see the spirit of distra action that is in our age is killing our prayer life it's killing our consecration it's even destroying Family Life a spirit of destruction because we think that the thing that will bring us success are out there the thing that will bring us success is right here it's right here amen the things that will bring us success is not out there that's what I'm trying to I'm I'm trying to build with all of this drama that I'm doing tonight right the thing that will bring us success the thing that will make us Overcomer it's not a new preacher we bring in it's how much we pay attention to the world we have how much we pay attention to the message that been preached to us that's the thing that will bring us Revival many people that will make their New Year resolution and and and all of the things that they want to achieve praise the Lord you will find that it's only among God's people that you will hear this year I want the Lord to help me in my prayer life I hope that God will give me the Holy Ghost praise the Lord if you put a percentage of people that have that desire you will see how little it is than the people that want to achieve the worst dream praise the Lord this coming year is my year you know of exploit when they talk about exploit glory be to God glory be to God glory be to God Amen I was just talking with my friend we were fellowshipping together you know and uh encouraging one another as we have come to the end of the year one thing for sure there are lot of people that are burning every Spirit of poverty this night of praying they're going to be burning poverty they're going to be destroying poverty it's not my portion praise the Lord am but when you look into the word you will see that God speaks to the sem that church age and he says I Know Thy poverty but thou I rich praise the Lord amen amen and if you really you really look at it the richest man in the word there's a place where he's poor there's a place in his life where he's ped praise the Lord some of them that the wealth has ruined their family life amen so if you actually look at it in in in God's eyes you'll realize that sometime don't don't just burn all your poverty like that because God give us a balance he said I know your poverty but you are rich and what he was pointing out to that age is that you you are you are you are caught up in this situation and this situation now is is is distracting you or this situation is is so major to fill your eyes that you're not even seeing the area where I'm blessing you you are not seeing the area where you are riching you are just majoring because you don't have money you don't have a good job you don't but the area where you are rich you are not seeing it that's what he was trying to point out to the church I know your poverty I know what you are going through but with God in our mess the one that have 10,000 cattles on the hell praise the Lord are we together amen that was the same that church age but when you come to LA church and what he says you are rich but you are miserable you are naked you are blind yes sir so if you are miserable you are naked you are blind then you there it's an area of poverty you are poor in this area it's a law of contract is God that plac those law there he plac it in our life the law of contract is in our life let us not reduce our God to material things and and and and and physical things and other things people have right are we together tonight he says I want to we are always telling the Beauty and the attraction of the church but we fa to tell them that Jesus said he that follow me let him deny himself take up his cross praise the Lord take of his cross just like the the the public the the the popular gospel people preach give your life to Jesus all your trouble will be ended right when the people give their life then the whole hell is against them right they realize that oh man the people lied to me they say when I give my life to Jesus all my trouble will be over right praise the Lord amen he says what are we using as the action what are we using testing for life he says and when the church lost its attraction when it comes to a time that you have to sign cards and things to come to church praise the Lord I think it's time for a prayer meeting or something to take place in the church praise the Lord the church has lost its attraction because our attraction is not in shape it's not in colors it's not in form you look you look there in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 8 this famous scripture that Jesus used men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God Moses told the children of Israel when the Lord came on the mountain he never took no visible form right for us to be attracted to form shapes and colors the thing that attracted us was the word man shall live by not by bread alone but by the word of God the word is our attraction praise the Lord as we go into the coming year with a promise that Christ will have a bride a people that the world will have a preeminence in it goes back to Genesis 3 our desire to our husand and he having the root over us he having the preeminence in our home the preeminence in our life it can only happen when the word becomes our attraction praise the Lord look people saints of God it is this word that form the universe is this word that is holding the universe this word this word there's nothing that can heal us more than the word am there's nothing that can satisfy more than the word there is nothing that can solve our problem more than the word praise the lord we will never be able to achieve and enjoy the benefit of the Cross if we put the word in second place the word is the last thing that we consult praise the Lord Jesus said if I be lifted up I with draw all men unto me now let me say this you have the humaning kingom that we are next to the human kingdom is the animal next to the animal you have the Minas that are in the earth praise the Lord for the mineral that are in the earth the all all the the the the the cting elements the potassium and everything is is within the Earth for those things to come out of the Earth the animal kingdom and the plant kiddom oh I mean yeah the the the the human Kingdom the animal kingdom the the plain Kingdom and the kingdom of the miners it's in the Earth praise the Lord the plants had to use their roots to be able to go down and bring up all the minerals that are in the earth the gets in the plant are we together the Animal Kingdom have to go down B your heads and eat the plant to be able to get the Minas that was in the Earth that that the plain Kingdom has draw amen praise the Lord the human Kingdom has to go down to the Animal Kingdom we have to hunt them we have to kill them praise the Lord even though many of us we go to shopping to cup food that's I mean we go hunt to cup food that's okay we go fish to C food that's fine but it's in the same s we have to reach down to the Animal Kingdom to get the mineral that is in the earth that came to the plant and the Animals got from the plant now they are in the animals we have to reach down and be able to draw it from the animal praise the Lord that is the same sense because it's supposed to be five kingdom there is one one that I left out is a kingdom that is above us praise the Lord there a higher Kingdom that is above us and that Kingdom also reached down unto us in the form of a man that came in assisting element body live the kind of a life that we live go through the things that we went through why he did that to be able to to draw us up to a higher nature than human life Hallelujah that's the way that God said it that's the way is it's a principle of life it's a principle of life he said it in his word if he humble our self we will be lifted up praise the lord it's a principle of life that God himself have to live by he humbled himself to come in the form of a baby just to draw us to to that higher form of life that Adam fell from there is nothing that has the drawing power praise the Lord if I be lifted up Jesus said I would draw all men unto me that is our attraction as we go into the years and we move in every step in this coming of the Lord not moving to the coming of the lord we are moving in this coming of the [Music] Lord praise the Lord may God give each and everyone of us the grace to be able to see the greatest attraction that has come our way praise the Lord no matter the internet and social media and everybody trying to Blackmail the message and everything there must be something truth about it I was I was I was uh looking at uh some few comments and somebody was saying in the lady said you know to some of these group she said said if you people can talk about this man willing Brandon and all that he have done you talk about the supernatural that was in his ministry it looks like one time he was like a God and another time he's like the devil she said you have created so much desire for me to go and see what is all about this man praise the Lord the coming of the Lord the message of the hour is the bride's attraction what God is doing in our day what he's doing in our life praise the Lord amen it might be you might call the small things you might Overlook it but the grace that he gives us for us to sit with our children sit with our family apologize to one another when we realize we are wrong hold our Bible and pray together the desire in our heart to be like him praise the Lord desire in our heart to live a life that is worthy of the Gospel that is that is the greatest attraction that is the greatest attraction I don't know what is your attraction for the coming year but I'm saying Lord here am I praise the Lord give me Grace Lord to be able to encourage some way fairing man to be able to encourage someone that is discouraged to be able to get one more soul to the kingdom amen that is that is my attraction for the coming year that God will be able to give us a Grace that will be able to bring this assembly closer to the Lord praise the Lord if we can be able to create a a a an atmosphere in this place where Sinners will walk in and they will know that the presence of the Lord is here that is my attraction for the coming year that God will give us consecrated lives praise the Lord that prayer meeting will not only be in church it will also be in our homes that is my attraction for the coming year because as I look into the word that's the thing that God is attracted to when his people are submitting himself for the Fulfillment of his word praise the Lord may God create that desire in your heart like I said I don't know what your attraction is I'm just trying to share with you mine and and also to make us to realize that a lot of the things that we think they are the attraction of the word the very same things are creating lot of distraction For Us Praise the Lord because of the advancement of our age we have the word I have an app on my phone that has the Bible in every written language Under the Sun every language that has a written version so the word is at our disposal the more we have the greater access we have to it the less we are attracted to the word the less we are making use of that praise praise the Lord you can find any version of the Bible where you you can you can know the Hebrew word for this or the Greek word for this the background of this right it's all at our disposal you can go right into the message tablet young people is not only for preachers right you can see what brother brandham said about born again just put born again every C everything he said about born again will come out praise the Lord the more asset we have the less we are attracted to it the less we are attracted to it praise the Lord like I said before I find a place to close here so we can pray like I said before I don't have no problem or issue on the qut of the day you know on on the message app you have the quote of the day it comes up you know and that's the quote of the day then the Bible verse is attached to the quot of the day and uh it creat wonderful meditation and uh with all of my Bible apps that on my phone every one of them send me a verse of the day praise the Lord but to me those are things for me to snack on they are not things for me to feed on it's something that somebody have already fed on yes and they are passing it down to me for me to snap back on as a Son of God as a daughter of God I want to get down to that word because the same asset they have I have the same assets even if I will have to take two verses by myself yeah to feed on I will take it then what you giv me to snack on I'm not going to dispar what you giving me right I'm going to keep it in my bag for snack but I want to be able to get into that word by myself and find something that I can feed on if I have to read two verse a day five verse a day few verses a day even a verse a day that it's it's not the pastor telling me which verse to read I'm choosing which verse I want to read and then I sit there and then I meditate upon it Lord I have just read this your word praise the Lord as we go into the coming year the clock is clicking an hour from now will be in 2024 if there's ever ever the time where each and every one of us need a closer walk with the Lord if there is ever a time where we need this word to be more real to us praise the Lord I hope you seen the picture I tried to show to you today the more access that we now have the less we are attracted to the word yeah praise the Lord the more access we have now the less we get so distracted by the many things that we have to do yes sir that we have so little time for the word in our life may God give us Grace and let the word be our attraction praise the Lord amen you can you can you can design your own time the Bible says he will be your desire and that's how he will have the ru over you yes sir when you are attracted to the word then he have the preeminence in your life yes sir praise the Lord it's a prophecy God will find a people that will be attracted to this word and many people say there is nothing happening around the message the move of God is still on God is still in the healing business he's still in the delivering business he's still doing everything he have said in his word is because some people are givings to the word and others are not the ones that are not giving themselves to the the word they are not experiencing the joy of the word the one that are giving thems to the word they are seeing the word living every day in their lives the Lord bless you tonight let the word be your attraction as we go into the year coming let's bow our heart together let's sing the A Chorus with s the other night you are

same um anyway I was uh I had to work one night uh let's see what was it uh it was when we were having cold weather we're having cold weather now for a period of time we weren't having cold weather but we had cold weather and we had uh uh it was a a a Rainy Night a snowy night and it was icy and so at the school they were having some activities and so I had to go in to Salt everything so that uh it wouldn't be slippery for everybody so I went in and I I did that I was uh supposed to be a let's see I went in for a couple hours I and then I clocked out and I went out to my car to leave and I realized I didn't have my key it's like where's my key I couldn't find my key and so I um so I you know I thought well maybe I left it I couldn't imagine where I left it but and I thought well J was it in the car did I lock it in the car so I called my wife and asked her if she could come bring the other key because I always keep a spare key I just didn't have with me so I called her she's going to bring the key and um so took a while to get there but she brought the key well she was determined that we were going to find the key I lost so we looked I mean I I I emptied like I went through like 10 bags of salt she took every bag out of the trash and looked through every bag so she made me retrace my steps so I had to retrace my steps and it was cold out it was windy it was cold and I went everywhere where I where I'd thrown the salt and and so that was one side of the building we went to the other side of the building and it was the last place we went to and there was my key right in the middle of the road which cars had been traveling could have they could have easily ran over my key you know it's it's one of those keys that it's not a really fancy one but it's one of those you know that you can open your doors with and stuff it would if they ran over it it would have been bad news and uh so I just really thank the Lord thank the Lord for my wife for her determination to make sure that uh I searched for this key uh I was I was happy just to leave with one key and then I'd get another key later but she wanted to make sure I found that key so I thank the Lord for and I thank the Lord that that I found the key so anyway thank you sister Kelly okay come on come on Let's uh uh Emmanuel turn on one of these things for us which one I so services this weekend and I just wanted say that um our son Loy asked me a couple of questions and he just said what was your theme for 2023 and I said okay well all year long what I had been thinking was Lord I just want to pass this test this next test the first time whenever God would test me with something but for 2024 I just said all the scriptures will be fulfilled and I just I'm just really rejoicing about that and after the sermons this weekend and how he was sharing about how over the course of time the it was prophesied and it's just scripture being fulfilled in our lives so [Applause] cool somebody saying yes come up come up brother come up I'm hearing your voice I'm looking for you no try these things try this one okay this one should be better hello this thing stay on okay um say uh uh uh brother brother Steven said The the ball rolling I just go with the the Lost stuff yeah so I recently visited a home that's bam in Ghana and uh I had a couple of meetings that I needed to attend to so um my last meeting uh it was a little delayed so I had to reschedule my flight to make sure I attended the meeting um so I I I initially wanted to come back here on the 7th of December but I rescheduled it till the 11th and uh I went my with my green card I flew there with my passport my Gan passport so coming back I would have Flo with my I mean I flew here with my green card on the 11th I was trying to put my stuff together I had my back packed but I was just just putting the last stuff together and then it just dawn on me the Lord had giving me an instruction to do something so I did that and then I was like let me check for my green card to see if it's still in there cuz I was going to fly that evening and this was around 2 something 23 so I checked my card holder and my green card wasn't in there and it was still only only cut that was was missing that has never happened to me before so I was a little bit confused and I got on my knees go my prayer show covering me and I prayed then the lord gave me a certain peace in my heart even though I didn't understand what was happening but he gave me some peace in my heart that all was well so I got up yeah I got up and I think the next day he pointed he pointed me in a certain direction to go look there but the voice was so small I overlooked it I was like maybe I'll do that later let me just check my bags so I looked through all my luggage and I go even another person came in and helped me even I mean I mean two more sets of eyes to be better so I go I called another person and they came in helped me look to the back we turn everything upside down look through all the zippers there was there was nothing so I was using an SUV and then I told my car dealer I needed him to change my um my car for me cuz I had I had gone to the Airlines and they told me I wouldn't be able to fly I had a copy of it on my my my laptop so I wouldn't be able to fly with it so I had to go to the Embassy to talk to them and they took me through some process the long story short it was going to take me at least 21 days to get it to get something called boarding foil so when I get here then I can uh work on getting a a replacement but I think the day I went to the Embassy um two days afterwards the Lord LED my my feet to one of my Prophet friends and then we prayed after the prayer he told me the donkey is not lost oh my God he told me that story about the donkey and then uh Saul I'm not sure he even knew what he was talking about but God was talking to me and I didn't understand it my my my brain was just clouded with like what can I do give me direction God was giving me direction but I was not listening so the next day uh I gave my car to the the dealer and then had the brother that um so this was what happened when uh my the prophet friend was praying for me I talked to him about the C situation that this is my case right now I was going to I'm going to be staying here for the next 24 hour 21 days at least so I needed a car change so I can cut down my cost and then I'll take care of the other stuff so we talked to one brother they called one brother in and they talked to him and then he got me another car so it was the next day that I was supposed to meet him and then take that car and give my the the one I was using to the dealer so I called the dealer and then I gave him a place a location to come meet me so he came and met me I I handed a about the car to him and I was waiting for the other brother to come meet me there so I could take the other car but I waited for like an hour plus he didn't come so later on he called me and when I picked up he was like uh the traic situation from where he was to my place it was headach so I should just come meet him at a different place and where he mentioned was exactly where the Lord pointed me to go look so when he mentioned that it just dawn on me you were supposed to go there you did not so go check so I went and met him there and then I was like could you please drive me to this so and so ATM and let me check something he went and park in there and then I went and spoke with the security guard and he asked me two very interesting questions what car were you using and what day was it so I answered it and he said wait I was anxious I was like what are you talking about why are you asking me specific questions so I was just waiting and then he went into his backpack pulled out the card I'm like Am I Dreaming or what I've been looking for it all all over I mean I've i' used a lot of ATMs to withraw cash but the Lord did not point me to any of them he pointed me in this direction and I did not go there cuz the voice was very small I thank God for the Lost donkey has [Applause] before is there any other Thanksgiving come up praise

blessing that you can ever ask in the world you know um he was there praying for us you know really honest and very direct to us us and he has been a blessing to us and we really appreciate him we want to really say to him directly uh but based on the things that we we Crossing there's different scriptures that were coming in my mind and and I'm even shaking right now because I'm a little nervous uh because God was pointing me to something you know and I think if they can help us there's few scripture I want to read here and I hope there can be an encouragement to you uh Isaiah 558 uh that was really powerful he really encouraged my heart it says for my thoughts uh okay I'll just read it it says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your way my ways sayth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts and it brought me again to Romans chapter 8 verse 28 it says and we know all things work together for good to them that love God Amen to them who are called according to his purpose yes you know it did not say some things he said all you know as as human being you you're Crossing you're going through hardship you ask a lot of question you even Beyond you start thinking you even go beyond you say Lord did I sin did somebody sin and sometime you can't even blame other people you know is it somebody's fault that all this things are happening then God start ministering to me you know he gave me an example you know he start ministering to me different stories in the Bible to look at it in a different angle you know sometime you would just read the Bible like oh I know the story you know but I start questioning like why would God create Lucifer and eventually you know it will be the right-handed man he created literally his own enemy but to display his power it must sound to be negative why would he do it but he had a purpose he the mass of all things why would he create something that he eventually fight him and he knows that he will overcome it but in all of it he has a thought you know the story of Jonah came into my mind and which really struck me if you look at the story of Jonah God told him and said go to Nineveh it was a direct command we will say this was God's perfect will to go to Nineveh he disobeyed he went to tares and when he went to tares you know he got in trouble and all of it which is the side that trouble comes into our life right and you look at it it comes and the the the the well comes and swallows him and he stays in the in the the in the belly of the well for three days and three nights and eventually the story turns into him going back to Nineveh you know but there's something that caught my attention if uh Jonah way is the permissive will right and God's perfect will was to go to Nineveh then if you look continue later on in the scripture the sign of the Resurrection that Jesus used it was based on the three days and three nights yeah so if Jonah did not go to tares which was the permissive will of God yeah that's right God will now refer to that scripture later on yeah so I looked at it said you see a permissive will to an elect of God even if it sound to be permissive God would turn it into a perfect that's right so God start ministering to my heart and different stories start opening can you imagine another story of RAB for instance you look at the story of RAB God sends Israel to Egypt and stuff he say you know you'll go for 40 days I mean you leave Egypt and go to the promised land it was a short distance but it took them 40 years so which means that if they went directly from from Egypt or maybe the Red Sea to the promised land directly RAB would never come into a picture because she was not even born yet so the 40 years that the stay in the Wilderness was for a purpose God was looking at an elect son or an elect daughter of God and you can't see it through out the scripture even David God told him don't number the people of God he went and numbered and the Bible says Satan pushed David to number the people so God used Satan to literally do something and if you read the Bible at the end you realize in number of the people God gave him three choices judgment comes is struck him but yet if you continue the very place that David buil the alt that was in Jerusalem so if he had not numbered the people David would never have the vision of Jerusalem so you can't see it throughout the scripture that in our life it might sense to be negative but there is a purpose behind it that's right that's right you know this is something you know I'm saying it with a broken heart just after losing a child but I want to encourage you to as you stepping into a new year as if you of course you're a Son of God and a daughter of God you may not see the positive side of it but you need God to open your eyes to see it that at the end of the road is a purpose and of course there's a lot you know we all praying for the young people and all of it which is a good thing but as they are out there you don't know how God is dealing with them yes and if they come they come back with conviction no man can take that out of them you see so he it helps us to to leave the religion out of it but to have a personal experience you know so God really ministered to me lately I mean these past days he has come to me really strong and I'm I'm going to conclude with this scripture here there there's two more but we don't have time anyways um Ephesians chapter 1 verse 3 it says blessed be the god of our father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blesses blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according has he has chosen Us in him so we were in him before the foundation of the world it says that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love so the Holiness is not literally our Holiness it was something that was already done it's a finished work actually that's right having predestinated us that's the past tense you know English is my second language but obviously there's a d the end you know that means the past having predestinated us onto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will in whom also we have obtained aain an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will so everything that we're crossing there is a purpose that God is he has that in his mind he's focused and knows exactly what he want to fulfill and as the Pastor said this morning he will use our body yes to fulfill that very same thing that he want to do so that at the end of the of the game you turn back you say oh God that's you you have done it you have started to he I mean just look at why we here we're here because of a certain purpose that God already saw we could have died as a young person but we've reached a certain age you wonder how did I get here that's right you know I wonder that you know there there's a lot I went to college and I mean I went to different places the Lord kept me at the same time he kept my wife you know even my wife to be there is just a miracle I mean I I lived in in Virginia I fell a pool to go to North Carolina for some reason you know few years ago I fell the pool I didn't know why because it wasn't just the right time she was not ready then I was not ready then just looking at us if it were if it happened at that time no we wouldn't even talk you know but all things work for good you know and if I had been in another location than this location we would not even be together if we did not have a pastor we would not even be together because there is a certain PL there's a certain part that he played into our relationship and we appreciate that a lot brother one may God bless you and all the saints God bless you thank you I appreciate [Applause] it the clock is clicking okay sister Tera I see your hands Emmanuel that's a young technician I really want to thank God for the family of God um it has been like 13 years that we moved to us as I grew up my mother never like us to go her way kind of like even for sleepover my daughter has been asking me for sleepover for a few times I told her I never go I never went for sleepover I don't know what is it so yeah but I I really want to thank God for the family of God because when you grow up you're so attached to your biologic family you don't really see the importance of other people in your life but in this place I have learned the importance of the family of God 4 years ago I decided to go back to school that's the time I had Karen and it was by surgery all my three children was surgery I really thank God because at that time I didn't know how I would handle it I had samel he was only two years old and he was so active that's true and then while I was in the hospital brother Marx told me that sister Bridget and sister relle will come to stay with us I say this is a blessing and then they came they stay with me and it was really a blessing to stay with them for that period of time I could not I could I was not able to hold my child because I could not U order like 10 pound more because of the surgery so I really thank God for them and then when I decided to go back to school it was not also easy I was always tired you have to study and I was studing sleeping I'll be sitting on the couch and my husband will be like you just stop with this schooling I say if if I'm not doing it now I will never do it I have to do it now because I will never have the strength to do it he said okay okay since it's your decision we will support you I said okay but I thank God for he has been he helped me through that he put people around me especially Bridget she has been a blessing as a family there's a sister in Christ and after I finished school I was supposed to take the bo test my husband was like you have to take this test in 3 weeks after you finish your school I said no I can do that I can take even three months to study he said I'm not giving you three months I'm going to take off from my job for 2 weeks and you're going to spend time studying I said no I can't I can't do this why are you forcing me I know myself I'm the one who's studying I'm the one who went to school okay you are the one who went to school but I gave you three weeks and I'm taking off from my job and you have to study and he look at me so why are you scared you're going to pass I said no that test is so difficult people fail and then said no you have 3 weeks and you have to study I said okay so he took his two weeks off he take care of the children and I go to the library I would study and the day few days before I would tell him I say we can just push this you know just give me some time he say no we will not go back you have to go take that test even the day I was going to take the test I was like I don't want to go but I went there and I did a test and him too he was praying he said oh I push her and she has to pass that test if she doesn't pass it's going to be on me but thank God I went there and I passed the test so I really want to thank God because I really want to thank God because everything just the way brother ER just Testify the people everything work together for our good I really thank want to thank God for that because I seen him especially going to school as a mother and there's a wife I did schooling while I was young I had all the support of my life my parent was there my brother was there my sister was there so it was easy and you thought maybe it's just your own eort and you are so smart but I want to thank God because he's not being smart he God [Applause] grace you know what brother one and the church uh I was thinking about it when I came back from Kenya or home uh I felt like I should testify and say thank you Lord for the trip but the Lord led me in a day different direction because uh it was a good trip blessed trip ups and downs and uh I'll just bring one uh or two incidences uh the way the Lord had been good to me in that trip uh first of all I'd like to say thank you uh church for praying for me uh it is always my I can say my habit of requesting prayers whenever I travel anytime anywhere uh and the inspiration I get it from the book of uh Thessalonians where Paul sylvenus and timotheus asked the church they say unto the Church of the Thessalonians in God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ if you we come to chapter 3 it says finally Brethren pray for us the three of them they asking the church to pray for them the same thing I did for myself I asked the church I'm traveling to Kenya please uh church pray with me uh it's a long story but I'll cut it short I'll just bring that point that I wanted to bring I know uh I took a plane from here to Amsterdam we reached there in the morning and then from there I took another plane that's around 8 hours flight 9 and then 6 hours flight to Kenya 6 7 hours so that's around 15 hours on the on the plane in the air the travel from here to Amsterdam was uh uh it was good and then from Amsterdam I took to Kenya we left uh left there around I think midday we got uh to Kenya around midnight no around 10:00 so I arrived safely there uh there are some incidences in the you know I don't know how to explain it but the person sitting next to me was so um she had a very big attitude that she didn't even want me to you know you if you're sitting in the plane the space is so small but then she took a pillow and put it next to me so that we don't touch I said okay fine that one went on you know when they pass the drinks you reach out to get it she would say why are you you know uh why can't you sit I said no I I need to reach out for a drink so uh after that I took out the Bible and started reading on my Bible app and uh I don't know how it happened she just went to sleep and I read my Bible so for a long time so uh well we reached Kenya uh I I arrived well in the morning uh wait I stayed there for 3 days and then uh two days I think so and then on a Friday I took a plane in the evening around 6:00 uh the plane was uh it was a domestic plane uh domestic flight it's a small plane it's not like these big boings and uh we took a plane around 6:00 and it's just an hour flight from the place from the main city to my home uh airport it's just like Twin Cities and uh Rochester so when I took the plane uh it took off well we were in the air almost like 10 minutes or 15 minutes uh while in the air uh uh by the grace of God they I didn't want to I didn't want to testify this because that time I knew many people are flying out so I didn't want to be interpreted differently so the plane just dropped you was thinking about me yeah so the plane just dropped but uh I found comfort in the word of God um I don't know Emanuel can you project that song on the myy clay or something like that there's a line there I want to refer to do you have it closed anyway so uh I don't know what happened to the plane I can't explain it but it just dropped dropped in the sense that the engines died yeah there there's no sound there was nothing immediately people were shouting and you know they were screaming H screaming oh what at that moment the Lord spoke to me and he asked me and uh go to the next verse next one where it says if if my heart is Right u a new song anyway uh so uh the Lord gave me it was like a song it spoke to my heart to my soul you know we say the Lord speaks but let him speak to your heart it's so different I had a very sweet sound voice and it asked me the two questions if I remember very well the first one was this are you ready no first he ask me is your heart right I did not think twice I said yes my heart is right he asked me again are you ready to go I said yes and immediately the pain came back I don't know why you see in that such instances if the word of God is the one that keeps you you know sometimes you don't have a brother next to you a sister next to you uh your wife next to you or your pastor next to you to pray with you a deacon to pray with you what are you going to do it's the word of God which will keep you you see I did not scream I did not call even the name of Jesus Christ I just answered the question two times you know is your heart right yes are you ready to go yes and the plane came back that was a great experience you better meet God in your own experience don't rely on somebody's else experience let it be your experience with your God I'm telling you from that time I had victories all I had victories I would I don't know if you should continue I had one incident whereby there a I had to take a um okay this one was in the city that I live in now there's a car I have to take a commuter bus from the place I was to home and now it was in the middle of Two Cities now from this city to this city the cars come full either way so you can't find any car you have to just wait there and pray your luck you know but the person I was with I told him uh let's stand here and see whether they will only car we'll get any commuter bus that will come through that's empty or has some space we waited and waited and it was getting dark now we left uh we stayed there for almost uh an hour no car coming I told him let's pray and then we pray then immediately another car came and stopped and asked us if you want to go I told them I told my cousin let's go went to the car went to light the car and then I learn something told me stop don't light don't don't go don't board this car then I looked around and then uh the people did not look like passengers there so I stepped back and I told the driver just go my cousin asked me why did you leave it I said no I did not feel like boarding that car so the car left so another car came uh to make the story short the person asked us to get in he was the only driver in a whole car he took us home safely so I thank God for all that trip so thank you Brothers for the prayers and uh we'll share more because many things happened but through your prayers God saw me through God gave me victory and I have a new song Thank you praise the Lord praise the Lord sisters is there anybody testifying okay missing for me to stay back home for like an extra five days it was
