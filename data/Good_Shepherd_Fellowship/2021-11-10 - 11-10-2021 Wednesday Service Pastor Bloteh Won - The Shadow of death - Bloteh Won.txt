some service you know i'm not a good some seriously i mean uh some leader so you just forget about it and uh if you left with me i just turn the pages of the bible and start preaching right now but uh uh we were going we were saying few songs and and it will be uh songs that uh that we will suggest to sing tonight just so we can praise the lord and thank the lord uh as we as we just worship the lord together brother hillary is gonna bring a tribute to brother scared tonight we want to bring announcements to you and uh to many of you that have seen the the obituary and just like i said concerning this assembly we will bring our tributes here in church on sunday we might have a few visitors that some of the brothers that are flying in they will they will give uh their tribute year in church we will give them that their opportunity to bring tribute to brothers cat uh year in church so we will give them the first place and so if you keeping your tribute for sunday there are many more sundays to come so as as we go on and you think about brothers care something you remember and you want to give tribute to him just let the deacons know we will call you or we will make time so you can be able to give your tribute to brother scared so the the visiting will be tomorrow evening 5 p.m the information is sent out if you don't have it you ask one of the brothers and sisters that will share it with you or send me the text i will text it to you and uh just like we have announced yet in church if you are not well uh it would be i mean it would be good the the the the visitation and the funeral service will all be uh they will be streaming it so you can also follow online we are hoping and believing that the law will give us an opportunity where we can be able to have a memorial brothers cat and where we can just uh do a lot of singing testifying and we were playing that with with the family and so for some time uh in the in the soon future but uh for the program this coming weekend uh with the time space that is given is a program that will that would be just to the family for them to be able to express the uh their memory of uh their dad and uh and grandfather and citizen army husband so that that's what the program will be we have an hour it's a short space of time so there will not be there will not be room for every one of us i know we all would like to give tributes we would like to sing we like to do all of that but we have we have this place to do it you know we have this place to do it so whether someday this coming sunday like i said we will give much time to the visitors that might be visiting with us we do uh uh some some singing on on on on sunday and then we give a little time to the word but it would be a kind of a thanksgiving service to see what the lord brought us through this uh this couple of weeks we we we we need to give god thanks and pray so uh that's that's what the service would be so if you're you have uh if you cannot make it uh uh follow the service on uh the the the visiting in the funeral online if you were not feeling well don't don't feel like you know if i don't show up you know sister naomi will not be happy you know if you're not feeling well we understand that so don't don't just show up because you just want to show face you know let's be mindful we are living in difficult times we must be grateful that we we even have this time you think about when things were tough you know remaining ones that couldn't go to the funeral of their loved ones so let's let's just let's just keep one another in mind you know let's let's not be so much concerned about ourselves you know and what we want to do and i want to be there but think about others you know and so that's what we want to say to you tonight and the the family we appreciate i know many of you have been wanting to go through the house and go and visit with sister naomi we will have time for that you know you have to remember that sister grace is away sister esther uh brother lloyd and so i mean they want to they want to catch up a little time with their mother you know they want to just spend time so when everything's settled down if and then the lord kind of forgive us a good time we can we can make a visit to sister naomi house saint son spent some time with her so don't don't think that uh the the family is trying to avoid us you know even myself beside friday i just i try to just give them space so they can be able to catch up you know they can be able to to to spend some time together praise the lord for every one of us we know that it was a it was a sorting it was a shock to every one of us it was a shock i spoke to brother scott on on wednesday we all we were laughing on the phone and uh uh a little bit you know it's not that bad scout was sick he was there reading and we all knew that maybe the law would take him home no it was it was a shock so the family are still healing you know the family are still healing we instructed people to call brother jordan if you wanted to know some things because sister nami was not taking her phone her children i think maybe they took her phone from her and and uh you know so all of that there are a lot of things that they have to they have to look through as a family found some sense of direction so uh let us let us not uh take any kind of ill feeling today let's let's feed for them and continue to pray with them you know it's almost like jesus said the poor you have with you you know we have just now been here we have sister faith here we will spend we will spend uh uh much time with them so let's uh let's understand those things together praise the lord and uh so we would sing a song here and and then our brother hillary

tonight amen and uh so uh we would just change the order of the service here uh brother vusi from soweto was the one that taught us this song when he visited and that was one of the song that got stuck in brother scat head for a long time i remember we were working together as soon as he see me and i come over and he's sinking a god stuck in his head for a long time praise the lord let's stand on our feet tonight psalm chapter 23. amen praise the lord i taught uh uh brother dan was ready but it looks like he had he have to put himself together maybe he don't want to come up and cry tonight so psalm chapter 23. let's uh i read verse one and you read verse two and we will all read verse six together the lord is my shepherd i shall not one he restored my soul he leaded me in a path of righteousness for his namesake thou prepared a table before me in the pressing of my enemies thou anointed my hair with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will do earth in the house of the lord forever amen let's pray together heavenly father lord jesus we just want to thank you tonight and father we want to pray that god you will come and and uh take this portion of the scripture that we have read tonight may something be said that we encourage our hearts or father and we love you we appreciate you we bless your name tonight what a way father god to to remember our brother lord god is is not a worship to him it is our appreciation to you for a life that means so much to us we thank you father in jesus name amen the lord bless you you may have your seat praise the lord amen uh but scared was so special in a way that is hard to be like him amen it's hard to be like him you can impersonate him he was one of his kind tonight i want to share the uh just a few quotes with you from the prophet of god tonight talking about uh uh uh what david said that in the psalm close my bible here but we know that david said in the psalm though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i would fear no evil for that i would mean that wrought in that staff they comfort me i want to talk about the shadow of death tonight praise the lord i want to pick up just a few thoughts from brother branham and talks about the shadow of death brother branham over and over said uh uh he taught us you know people said though i walk through the dark shadow of death he says that's a very wrong interpretation death is not a dark shadow death is a shadow and shadow a shadow is made when there is setting the mount of light in a certain amount of darkness a shadow cannot be cast if it is just all light praise the lord shadow cannot be cast if it is completely dark for you to cast a shadow there have to be a certain amount of light in a certain amount of darkness for a shadow to be cast the bible says the old testament the lord was a shadow of good things to come so the lord the old testament or the lord had an amount of light that could never come to fullness until our lord jesus the light of the world came that's why he said i never came to destroy the lord but i came to fulfill them praise the lord all of the things that were clouded in the law that we could not understand jesus came to bring them to light praise the lord so we we want to just talk a little bit tonight and and i will take a quote of brother branham a year from from the adoption series he said yeah uh uh he started talking about this in the adoption series he says you begin your internal life right here at the altar years where you start eternity praise the lord oh you start internal life right here then you are born again as son of god and then when you die when your death strikes you in this body and your heart quits beating and the mortal wheels begin to stand still that little shadow that was a shadow of shadow in one second it becomes a shadow of the shadow then the next it becomes the shadow then the next it becomes a little twinkle then the next it becomes a creek then the next it becomes a river then the next it becomes the ocean and after a while you are standing in the presence of your loved ones standing younger the lord now it happened so quick like the bible says in the twinkling of an eye but that's that's the journey you takes when you are born again praise the lord because when you are born again that's that's where your internal life begins and that's where death hits you praise the lord amen so after you know uh uh i've i have a i have a message that i'm now preaching and still looking for where to preach it and when to preach it that i entitle the pulpit it's just a tombstone when you go to the grave you see many graves just like this a cross with a tombstone because this is the place where many of us are buried praise the lord that's the reason why never never fish him to run to the altar because this is your grave praise the lord the pulpit is just a tombstone every time we come to service we're looking for the opportunity to have another funeral where somebody will be ready to die to themselves die to their pride die to the arrogance come to the altar praise the lord living in an age where people young people feel so ashamed to come to the altar but brother bram says that's where your internal life begins right here peter said judgment begins in the house of god he says if the righteous will be scarcely saved where where the sinners and the ungodly appear praise the lord amen brother scott and his wife way back many years in the seventh days these are people that have been walking with this message from way back in the 70s you think about it and even with his age he never found an excuse to stay away from church you begin your internal life right here at the altar years were you start eternity all you start internal life right here then you are born again as son of god praise the lord many christians are looking for their internal life when they die praise the lord but we know by the new birth not just a simple confession but the new birth that brings you to separation amen begins internal life in your body praise the lord but as brother branham is saying it here that eternal life you have it in a shadow form it's in the shadow form that's the reason why sometimes you are on fire for god and sometimes you are you are you are you you are you are angry you are depressed you are disappointed you you you you go through trials you get sick because you only have it in the shadow form praise the lord amen sometimes you go through some things in life and you ask you you you you wanna in your mind am i ready safe it's because you have it in a shadow form praise the lord and as you starts to go like brother branham says somewhere there he says it's just like a little button a deposit that quicken in your soul you can't explain it but you believe that you are safe praise the lord amen you believe that it's in your heart your salvation is not attached to church affiliation it's attached to a relationship with jesus christ but it's in the shadow form and as you travel in this life you start going from one shadow it's it's almost like a person approaching the light and you see you see the shadow there could be uh uh uh an elderly person like bro like brother dan he's a he's a very tall person but as if he's far away from the light you see the shadow like a little boy and as he as he starts to approach the shadow starts to grow the shadow starts to get bigger praise the lord and that's the way it is is that that that shadow of internal life that we have in us as we walk with god and we travel through this life the image starts to grow it starts to become real to us praise the lord amen it starts to become real and as you grow in the lord heaven is not just a picture in your mind but it starts to become a true feeling in your heart you start to experience a peace that passed all understanding praise the lord when that when that experience hits your heart you can't keep grudge you don't feel happy gossiping about somebody you you don't feel happy keeping anything that is unpleasant in you praise the lord when you just bomb into something that is wrong you feel so uncomfortable people that would claim having eternal life and and and and they can sleep in sin and wake up in sin they just have a confession they don't have an experience praise the lord now so brother branham said here he says when death strikes you in the body and your heart quit beating and the mortal wheels begin to stand still the little shadow that you have in you it starts to go from shadow to shadow it starts becoming real praise the lord amen it starts becoming real it starts to go from shadow to shadow to shadow that's how you travel so fast praise the lord and from shadow to shadow then it becomes like he says yeah a twinkle then next it looks like a creek you go so fast and then you start to break into a sound have you ever gone in a world where there is a creek you hear how the water rolls you are passing from mortal life to eternity you start to lose sound you they are crying they are yelling you start breaking on the other side and he's like praise the lord then the next thing it becomes like a river then the next thing is like an ocean you start to feel an atmosphere starts to hate you you are stepping into an atmosphere where you are feeling you are feeling the heavenly atmosphere praise the lord you go from shadow to shadow to shadow and as you as you're going through this shadow the light starts to break forth the darkness starts to pass you see brother brandon share this life this life right now where we're sitting down in church this is just the negative everything that you see and you know of yourself is the negative you ever seen the negative you look at the the the fame the negative you look so funny you look how you look at the light how my nose looking it looks so funny it's just the negative praise the lord and then after a while you are standing in the present of your loved one standing yander clothed in a garment of a celestial body praise the lord so as you are going through this shadow you have already dropped off this body and you're going through the just like a vacuum sucking right into a celestral body and you are conscious you are conscious look at yourself that's me you look back he says oh wow that's me then this body that you cherish you start to see how so ugly and awful it is when you look down praise the lord you look down when brother branham says at a pet's house praise the lord the body that you've been so cherishing you feel so proud and better than other people you look at it you don't even want to go there you don't even want to go back in it you look at this one oh man you look at that one really you're being sucked you in a celestial body where you are conscious you are conscious starts to look around you though i walk through the valley of the or the shadow of death the valley of the shadow of death i would fear no evil you see that's why david could say this he says i will fear no evil because death is just a shadow that is going to break me forth to the other side this side is so dark light from the outside starts to press in and it sucks you through hey look at anybody praise the lord let's read on a little bit i won't keep you long because we just have so much of this to fellowship around these few days praise the lord you see when the lord allowed things like this he has a purpose amen he has a purpose he has a purpose he says and and after a while you are standing in the presence of your loved ones standing behind the cloth in a garment of a celestial body then just like we talked before i mean when when you are sucked into that present you are uh uh the lord comfort us in in in the sense that we meet people that's what brother branham says right into the presence of your loved ones you meet people that you are familiar with familiar faces praise the lord you don't you don't get into that place and starts to meet job and abraham no you meet people praise the lord people that you are familiar with and you recognize them quickly praise the lord and they will recognize you because they will all be right at jordan waiting for you praise the lord they will not be surprised and you will not be surprised it happened so fast that that just at that time you start to catch up let's read on a little bit well maybe we might just read this comfort ourselves tonight amen that's the reason why let's make sure our our heart is right that our life is right that there is nothing between your soul and the savior the lord that there is nothing between the soul and the savior because death could take us at any time praise the lord joshua and danny driving to service tonight and run into an accident i mean anything could happen praise the lord what matters is how we get on the other side praise the lord some goes from shadow and it gets darker and gets darker and gets darker praise the lord brother branham says sometimes they see it right on their death bed and they start streaming it's not getting dark it's dark in here it's because they're beginning to travel in that dark region for the man that got life at the altar he goes shadow and shadow and shadow and it starts to get brighter and after a while you are standing in the presence of your loved ones standing under clothes in a garment of of celestial body that you know one another that you know one another familiar faces you're not guessing praise the lord you're not guessing you say and and that is the reason why sometimes we made a very poor example where i mean you're in a church and and and you're having an opportunity to know a brother or having an opportunity to know a sister and and and and you just make yourself a stranger some people just step through the door they come to sit down listen to some arrived they just go and no no time to to even shake a brother hand and just let let me just visit with this sister today or this brother and ask oh brother how are you what i mean how are you what's your name praise the lord even in church we are on the clock we want the service to go quickly and then we just pick up our bag oh we we love to visit with our favorite person we have this one favorite person that we like to visit with and talk with celestial body that's you know one another love one another you have turned back to a young man and a young woman again exactly right in which there until the coming of the lord amen and and uh and someday that glorified body he says now remember that is a celestial body not a glorified body a celestial body and someday that celestial body will leave heaven with jesus praise the lord it will come down to pick up this body this one that we drop down you it will come and call this body to perfection for i said unto you second tester learning five or first testament and five brother brandon says one or the other i said unto you i would not have you ignorant brethren concerning those that are asleep that you sorrow net even as others which have no hope praise the lord that's the reason why we i mean we we can we i mean we can we can dwarve in sorrow our our our sympathy the feeling that we have praise the lord i was thinking on this and uh and just i mean just like i said sometimes you know when you start gearing your mind it's hard for you to get away from some things you were thinking about think about this i was thinking about something like this to speak on friday but you think about this jesus just told mary and mata that i'm the resurrection the life he just she just told mary your brother will live again praise the lord he told his disciples let's go to lazarus and wake him up praise the lord but my question to you he knew that lazarus was coming back to life but why did he weep yes that's right why did he weep he knew that lazarus was coming back to life he told the disciple let's go and wake him up it was good that i was not there but why did he weep then praise the lord oh he was just supposed to say oh glory be to god hallelujah it's coming to come i'm telling you people you'll stop crying but why did he weep before saying lazar come forth not even at the house when he got there and he met mary the martyr and he started crying oh my goodness my friend lost her he never even cried at the house he waited until they got to the gravesite he stood there he already asked and where do you let him and everybody started going he got to the graveside and the bible says he wept praise the lord now so think about it he's coming to call him out of the grave lazarus coming back to life then why are you crying jesus why are you crying he's coming back to life now so it's the same thing that happened to the believer we know that he's in a better body but yet at the graveside we weep [Laughter] we know that he's in heaven we know that he's in a brand new body but yet at the graveside there's a mixed emotion oh my goodness i'll keep the rest i'll keep the rest doesn't this look strange i mean if he was just only going to visit the grave and look at the tombstone say oh my friend lazarus oh lazarus but he already said that he's going to wake him up he was not just going to try to see if lazarus was coming up he was actually going to raise him from the dead but then why did he have to weep praise the lord so it's never the bad thing to weep at the gravesite it does not believe that you don't have faith it does not show that you don't believe that the person is in the brain new body praise the lord he's just a cross of emotion we appreciate the lord tonight for i said unto you i will now have you ignorant virgins concerning those that are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe christ died and rose again the 10 day even so those that sleep in christ will god bring with him praise the lord for we say this unto you by the commandment of the lord that we which are alive and and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent or handle the best word handle those which are asleep for the trumpet of the lord shall sound the dead in christ shall rise this celestial body come down and and put on effluent it puts on ethel just like we explained the three bodies the the terrestrial body that's what we had we are dwelling in now and we have a celestial body brothers cat is in his celestial body praise the lord amen but in that celestial body he cannot eat he cannot drink because he don't need it praise the lord he don't need it glory be to god you see that's why brother branham explained and says that when the believer choose to spend some time with the lord he fast and pray it's not a hunger strike he says when you feed hungry go and eat because if god called you to that time he's going to produ he's going to provide a gap where you're going to spend time with him not looking at the clock and feeling hungry praise the lord that's that's that's religion that's what the buddhists do that's what the muslims do but god will take you into a spear word you are not feeling hungry you just you are just there you want to praise the lord you just you just just a little time just a little time praise the lord you're not there looking at your time lord jesus help me father spending time on facebook your brain telling you i'm hungry no i'm fasting i'm fasting temptation full temptation sit on you tempting me i'm fast no he breaks you into a little time oh praise the lord hallelujah oak saints you will never never appreciate some of the things that the message brings to us you will struggle with it in your mind because it's just all you think you know is just a shadow of truth that's why when some things are said brother branham said you struggle with it in your mind and you think that you know better than the prophet this is a man that lived his life in a dual reign praise the lord brother branham talks about being in the prayer line for days without food for days with our full praying for people where did he got the strength from the lord you know one good thing i know about the lord he don't force nothing down our trout because he know if he force it down your throat you will vomit he wants you to eat it and enjoy it that's the thing about this word you have to enjoy it you have to enjoy the preaching of the word we're not stuffing you no we're not forcing nothing down your throat praise the lord if you are not enjoying it you will just look at us enjoying it because we love the lord and we love the word of the lord that have that have been given to us in this hour praise the lord this celestial body comes down and they put on effluent glorified body now a glorified body is when the celestial body blends with a telesco a terrestrial body when the two comes together then it's glorified praise the lord you can eat and drink and you can also go through a wall you have a body that can be touched praise the lord jesus was in a glorified body it never took his cast but when he read from he said don't touch me because he was in a celestial body you have not extended to the father yet so he's no don't touch me you are in a terrestrial i'm in a celestial these two cannot meet praise the lord amen that's the reason why it's glorious for them because they don't have to they don't think about oh i'm sleeping now oh i'm tired now they don't they don't have it they just go on talking and talking and testifying and and it's just joy unspeakable and full of glory full of glory praise the lord if i keep you anymore you start getting tired start looking at your time praise the lord amen my little redeemed has a way to tell me she's hungry she rob her stomach you start rubbing your stomach oh you love the lord tonight praise the lord i believe the lord wants us to talk about heaven a little bit he want us to talk about what will he be when we get over yonder praise the lord amen we get so bound down and talking about and everything that is happening around us and coronavirus and you know when and out of they said and he want us to talk about heaven a little bit he want us to look up a little bit and just think i wonder what are they doing there this celestial body comes down and put on effluent glorified body and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that moment twinkling of an eye shadows of shadows of shadow twinkling break rivers ocean so fast like a vacuum sucking praise the lord see that's the same thing that happened when the son of god a young man or a young woman really gave their heart to the lord and say oh god help me sincere pull their heart out you watch and see how the grace of god start dealing with that person you sit there in your church mine praise the lord you get out of this thing you got to be justified for it you got to be sanctified for you get all of these things in your mind and god have just taken that person from death onto life from death onto life happens in the service and we don't even see it brother branham says we don't we don't see it he said we he says we find people dying in the pill and also there are people that are passing from death onto life why they sit there the bible says why peter speak these words right before the eyes of those hebrews those who are hebrews believers those jewish believers they saw the gentiles passing from death unto life peter said wow god is no respecter of person he gave them the holy ghost even before they were baptized yes he says why why why then stop why why stop them from being baptized and as a preacher you don't you don't know what happened when a man stands behind this puppet it's not to read bunch of coats to you it's not a showman but you come behind this puppy with a burden in your heart watching to see someone passing from death onto life and you can see it you can see it thank you jesus you can see it praise the lord it happens many times we pass from death onto life not just only one time that's what the preaching of the gospel is all about is to pass you from death onto life praise the lord that's what brother branham taught us the reference that we have in the service when we come here not dragging our feet the church door is open by seven o'clock we come almost eight o'clock when the message is about to preach we come ready we come ready because it happens so fast while you sit there and think there is nothing happening in the service another person is sitting there and saying oh my god oh god thank you jesus oh god oh god oh god one verse or one phrase or one thing the preacher said just open heaven and just make that person power wow wow lord jesus thank you help me pass from death onto life do i walk through the valley or shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou out with me your rod that road and that staff shall comfort me because i know i'm going from shadow to shadow onto shadow onto shadow onto shadow musicians you can come tonight and that's the reason why we continue to encourage you young people don't play with the opportunity that you have when you come to the house of god let that desire [Music] of experiencing the supernatural let that desire of experiencing the holy ghost let that desire of experiencing being passed from death unto life because the day it hits you you will have no desire for the things that you think you can quit [Music] the day it hits you your life will never be the same [Music] [Music] brother branham says he says uh the scene at dawson series part four he says how how long are you sealed he says until the day of your redemption he says that's how long you received he said well when you die then brother branham was about after you die you said you will have it you have you have it forever where does life begin she says at the altar [Music] at the altar right there you see a little bit of shadow a little bit of shadow something strokes you you get on your knees you come to the altar you say oh god help me you pray whether the preacher lay his hands on you or not and sometimes you get up you go and sit in your seat it looks like nothing happened no something has happened just a little bit of shadow that's the shadow the seal of the holy ghost it comes in a little bit of shadow you see because it's in a shadow form the devil comes around he creates things around your life you don't have the holy ghost if you have the holy ghost you will not be thinking this if you have the holy ghost you will not be doing this because it's in a shadow form because people think that the holy ghost just make you a superman it changes you immediately no you have a battle to fight the holy ghost just introduce you to a fight you have to stand your ground when the devil brings thoughts to your mind you say satan you are a liar i'm not going to do it because it's just in the shadow form you're saying oh god help me lord jesus i love you even if i don't feel it i love you [Music] oh let's send to our feet tonight let's
