two years and i'm surprising myself that i can remember at least most of your faces i thought after after 70 years my memory may not be very good to remember people but i can see it's not that bad so may the lord bless you very much it's my pleasure and joy to come again and fellowship with you a lot of things have happened for that period of two years yeah there wasn't anything called covered but it has come and has made a lot of impact and changed our lives and also when i was here i was not married i got married i'm very happy i was able to get a lady about 47 years and we are very happy happily married and i thank god very much the other part of the family is fine and we are also expanding my sons were not married in fact we they were planning to marry before i married hold on before i got the idea of marrying so we sat down and negotiated we should marry first so i won the first situation so i married first and then they followed and one of them has given me a grandson and when i go back and find another grandson so my family are expanding when people are talking about coffee my family is expanding during the coffee time so with all bless you very much maybe i'll be talking more on sunday if i have that opportunity tonight i think we don't have much time so let's go to the word of god but i just bring victims to you from the saints from our church amen we are going to read from the book of fast corinthians 5. um yeah first corinthians chapter five and we are going to lead the verse six maybe up to eight your glory is not good knowing not that a little even liveness the whole lamp pass out therefore the old living that he may be a new lamp as we are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old living neither with a living or malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth let's also read from the book of deuteronomy chapter 24 i shall read about seven if a man without stealing any of his brethren of the shooter of islam and maketh mechanized of him or sellers him then that thief shall die and thou shalt put evil away from among you may the lord bless his word this evening let's have a wonderful prayer heavenly father we want to commit ourselves in your hands as we fellowship around these scriptures we pray that your grace and mercy will be upon us we ask for you we ask you lord to speak to us let not a man speak to us but we want to hear your voice your word is your voice father design our desires and what we need further spiritually this evening and speak accordingly we commit ourselves further into your hands we need your strength and ability of course we pray in the name of jesus christ our lord amen god bless you as you get seated i'm looking for the clock oh that's the clock okay all right yeah i just want to keep time i don't want to keep you this is a weekday and i think we shouldn't talk so much uh tonight i just want to fellowship around this idea in the bible and i'm going to call it lump without living love without living paul said your is not good do you know that a little even live underneath the whole lamp i really live in liveness the whole lamp and then he advises punch out therefore the old living that he may be a new lamp we are supposed to be a new lamp azir unlimited we are supposed to be unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old living neither with the living or malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth now i want to start with one point and whoever is putting this one on the on the wall there can do it i want us to read a quote is that somebody projecting okay all right okay can we have it you're gonna have to go ahead sorry about that okay or i don't need it for my all right rabban says well you say now brother branham i guess once in a once in grace always in grace that brings a lot of disgrace but when a man or a woman has been born of the spirit of god all things have passed away all things have become new and it's been bathed and blessed by the eternal god and they can no more perish than god himself can perish all right the only told me that a god that infinite god would come down and give you eternal life knowing that he was going to lose you serve you here knowing he's going to lose you there what did he save you for why he is working against himself if he saved you once you are saved for all eternity there is no demons in hell could upset you blessed be lord the prophet taught the eternal security of the believer and he said this kind of a believer we are talking about is not just somebody that imagines that he saved not somebody that gets some emotions around himself and feels that he is a he's a safety person they are quite a large number of people in this world that think they are saved but they are not saved at all in other words god has never had his heart upon them god has never begun any work in them at all but here the prophet tells us that if god ever saved a person right because the bible says that when we believe on his word when we believe on him here we have passed from death and to life and once that has happened it can never be really fast right yes it is just like a butterfly in the process of growth of the butterfly from a larvae to a pupa and then from there to a butterfly there is no way it can change again from butterfly and back to people or back to lava not there is no circumstances that that that process can can go backwards it doesn't matter what the butterfly eat it they made something different from the nature of a butterfly but it will never change it is in the same way that if god has saved us and he has taken us in that process of changing us from being lost changing us from being dead to being life there is no way and there is nothing that can happen that we can get lost [Music] praise the name of the lord let me just need another quote here just to continue confirming that idea because i want to begin with that you bear with me i'll be slow slower i thought i would have this one projected [Music] i hope i'm not wrong this one all right that's that's much let's leave that one out so uh therefore the thing is that it does not matter what you can do if god has done that if god has served you no matter what you can do even if you committed sin even if you backslade you cannot get lost i some sometimes people will talk like that and people think we're opening the door if you hear that no matter what you can do brabam said do what you want to do do what you like you won't get lost right right rambam said okay i do i do whatever i want sometimes people ask us and ask us does your church allow people to drink does your church allow people to marry many wives does your church allow this when somebody asks me like that i tell no our church allows people to do whatever they want to do sometimes they feel like that's a very good church they can join the church if you don't do what you want to do then you hypocrite if there is so much you want to do but because you accepted christ you are not able to do then you are not saved so i give this let's example for example i don't know how you know in our life there we have a lot of sheep and goats let's say i have got my own goat and i talked to my goat i told my god come here i'm not going to tire you i'm not going to bide you i'm not going to put her normally we put a rope on the on the goat so it doesn't go roaming around and jumping into the gardens and eating beans and cabbages so now my goat i'm going to set you free you can eat whatever you want you can go wherever you want to go you are free if you want to go in the garden go if you want to go in a farm you'll go you want to eat anything you want to eat cabbages whatever you want to eat you can eat so my goat is free but there's one thing i know as long as it is a good and i am not deceived that i'm having something else other than not good i know i'll never find that goat of mine scrambling with the dogs over bones however i'll never find it outside a butchery looking for somebody to get it's a piece of meat why wouldn't my goat do that so there is no law so it is although it is free but they cannot eat meat neither can it crack bones why because it will have to go by the decades of its nature [Music] the nature will never allow a christian is not a religion but their nature it is something that god comes and puts in you is a church and it becomes a new creature that is created after god with the nature of god you have the seed of god and therefore you will never desire to do also you are free although you know that whatever you do you still go to heaven you're never there blah blah blah said even the very thought of sin will condemn you their very thought to condemn you you will not do that right may the name of the arabic reform so what i'm going to speak about now here and the things that i'm going to say here that we need to do we need to to live is not to get saved no we know we are only deserved if i tell you thou shalt not steal thou shalt not do this i'm not we are not saying that to be saved we are already served right and we know we are we are we can never get lost now rabbi gave some example he gave an example of soul soul was totally vaccinated he was so backfiden god had nothing to do with him could never speak to him through their own through him neither through the prophet neither through the dreams god had cut off the relationship right but although he was in that condition because he had gone contrary to the word of god soul never got lost but says as the bible says when we call up someone someone told him tomorrow you'll be with me where i have been and where i will be and someone was in paradise yes so the following day even when saul died together with his son they never went to hell they went where someone was he never got lost now when abraham committed sin and lied even immediately after he lied god spoke to america and told him return that wife to that man that man is my prophet he never ceased to be a prophet just because he had committed sin he was hearing very good books with god are we together tonight all right now let me just leave that point there i wanted to hammer that point in that way to show that surely when god has saved us when god when we are passed from death and to life there's no nowhere we can change now from life to death right that's right when god has saved us he has saved us and god cannot save you knowing that tomorrow you backslide if you have seen god put his head upon your life and change you and transform you he has already seen he will make it because what we call predestination predestination is nothing else predestination is not god sitting down with his pen and the paper and saying okay let me see whom i will save i'll serve this man he doesn't seem to be very bad let me save that man he looks aloud and says this guy is no good at all that let this one go to hell that's not what presentation is all about when we talk about choosing god choosing it's not going goal good going round and then picking up this one will go to heaven this one will be my person this will not go to hell that's not what we just naturally mean predestination means god's for knowledge when god sat himself there and looked ahead he saw who would believe if the gospel was preached to him right he's so if so and so will hear the gospel he will believe therefore god said i don't have to wait until he believes i have already seen him believe so i put his name in the book of life amen i know such a such a thing will happen so i know so and so will be a preacher so i put him down he will be a preacher that's what is predestination predecession is by the four knowledge and when god has done that and when god has saved us he has saved us according to predestination which is according to his foreign knowledge he knew you'll be there praise be to god and god whatever god saw is correct he can never be wrong he's a right he saw that i would believe he saw that i would accept the word of god he saw our belief for him and that's why he did something in my life and changed me may the name of the arabic glorified there was another boy ramon was talking about who was called lambsi this boy started drinking was a preacher but then started drinking and he said has got nothing to do with the gospel again he has quit preaching and everything else and the boy continued like that he started continuing that habit and finally he got sick and later he died but the bomb said that boy did not go to hell that boy was saved what god did is that he removed him from this earth because he was putting this grace to his name but he never got lost praise the name of the lord tonight now for that matter now listen what the word of god says first of all let me emphasize we as believers called by god we are a lamp a lamp is a death dove i don't know whether it was a dove or death sometimes you get problems when we come around here one time i wanted to have some some hot water so i was ordering i said give me hot water someone said what what are you talking about it had hot water and there was strong about five minutes i don't know what you are talking about i think somebody had that conversation we have a we had a problem he said no he means hot hot water so i hope you are getting me here so we see um now we have to realize the bible says we as believers and as the children of god we are a lamp we are adaf you know when you mix water with with a with a with a wheat flour and you powered it you make duff isn't it now that that thing is what the bible is calling the lamp and we are that kind of a lamp so we are related we are interrelated and king now wants that one big lamp the bible says that a little living leaving us the whole lamp that whole lamb will be affected by a little living and what is that living now everybody says but brother uh sorry your glowing is not good no you're not that are literally even leaving this the whole lamp page out there for the old living that you may be a new lamp as early unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old living neither with the living or malice you can have an idea what living is malice and wickedness but with the unlivened bread of sincerity and truth and tonight a little while i'm just saying let us have this lamp without living let the lamb be without living as much as we are saved as much as we cannot go to hell as much as we are we know that we cannot get lost but seeing the living has the consequences it has consequences now a scene has something that does to the islam it makes it defiled it makes it living and this is a something we must observe that this islam stays without living may the name or not be glorified now we are alarm composed of individuals that are truly saved believers that god has saved and when we are together we are alarmed we are that affects we every one of us will affect the other and therefore if there is something like a living that comes into that lamp it is going to live in the whole body it is affected hopefully and therefore this lamb should be kept without leaving blessed be the name alone let's just just get back there a little bit in the first corinthians chapter five which starts from verse first one it is reported commonly it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his father's wife this church had such a such a big problem this church of believers had entered in such a terrible condition that there was lampang that a fornication was lampang it became just so common in such a manner that somebody eloped with his father with his father's wife it must have been that his father had married a young woman and this young man a lot with a with a wife it was a terrible situation his power said even this one is not reported among the non-believers now then pauses and ye are puffed up and have not rather moaned right just think about those words here is a lot of sin in the church terrible things are happening in the church but the people in the church may be the members of the church together with the deacons and trustees and maybe even the pastor they are puffed up about that now to be puffed up is to be filled with pride how people came to be so proud about over such a impunity of sin is actually understandable people were puffed up they were filled with pride they were conceited about this situation they were indifferent to this instance of gross sin recharge now in other word when this condition was there in that church and seeing was lampard in that manner the people were actually not bothered they were not concerned about it everybody don't care it means they were passive passive about the situation and the condition now they were not ashamed of it they were not pained by the church getting into this kind of a condition and therefore we find that these people are proud of it they were conceited about it in other because fornication was so common until the church became another tight and he lost the sense of outrage about sin then paul said instead of being in this condition this is what you should have done you should rather have moon may the name was already glorified moon he said you should have moaned of it the right reaction to this condition should have been mourning morning means is to feel or to show sorrow or regret and grief this is what when sin is committed uh this is what see this is what uh this is a condition that the condition of sin should bring upon the people they should grieve they should moan about it instead of doing that they were glorifying and adoling the people that were doing that they were expecting the people that were in those scenes they were honoring and boasting about it may the name of the lord be glorified what they should have done paul says they should have moaned in other words sin vex is a believer just like we see in the book of ii peter chapter let's see the book of peter ii peter chapter 2 verse 8. for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and healing healing works this lecture let's start from verse 6 and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into arches condemned them either an overthrow making them an example and to those that after after should live ungodly and deliver just lot worked with the fifth conversation of the wicked the right feeling the right opinion the right attitude of a christian over sin being committed in the church should be like what was happening with lord lord could see sin just allowed things just happening aloud and his soul was vexed he was not a very righteous man because the bible caused him backslidden but the scene that was happening in the sonoma gomorrah was so much even a backseater christian was vexed this is the condition that should be there for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and healing seeing and healing brahman said that this world is like a like like a big rubbish site where all rubbish all kinds of stuff you know from the whole city is being burnt there's a smell there's a few things and also a terrible smell coming around there that's how this world you smell to the believer and when that part of the world now comes in the church it vexes the believer and that's that that's the feeling that it caused in the believer now this is what he did now in in uh this is what it cost in lord lord was vexed by the evil this is a correct feeling that should these people should have had in in this place in the church of god paul was feeling that this is the way that they should have uh they should have felt about what was going on in the church we see the same thing happening in ezekiel the bible says that god came and spoke god spoke and said go through the city mark those people that are that moan moon because of the sin committed this is the right condition for people that are godly they should feel that we are about seen being committed in the church may the name of that glorify him now and they were marking the people that were sighing and mourning for the scenes that were committed in the city they were not like the people in the book of connections chapter five these ones were affected they were feeling that this condition was telling and they were praying already just even before god sent these angels to go through the city already that's the way the scene was you know that was there a feeling about the scene that was being committed in the city now we see that we see daniel in the book of daniel chapter nine the book of daniel chapter nine let's start from verse 3 and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and success and i prayed unto the lord my god and he made my confession and said oh lord the great and dreadful god keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him and them that keep him his commandments now daniel was confessing not only his sins but the sins of his people we have seen plural not only himself but also the people and he was concerned with the sin of the people and he was presenting this condition to god and repenting on behalf of the people we have seen and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from their precepts and from their judgments he was not just concerned with his own sin he was concerned also with the sin of the people of islam and he knew there would be consequences out of the inequity that was committed in islam in verse 20 it says and while i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people islam president lori he was not only concerned with his own sin sin but he was also concerned with the sin of the whole of islam this is the light conditioned this right feeling of the believer the true believer about seeing happening in a church now we are not going to be passive about wrong things happening in the church just because we know we can never get lost we got to walk in a perfect way we have to walk in righteousness we cannot tolerate sin no as believers we cannot look around and see sin being committed and the wrong things happen in the church and we be quiet about it a true heart will be vexed by that a true heart will moan for that a true heart will do something about it because as we shall see we shall see what sin does if it is there in the church as much as we are saved as much as we are going to heaven as much as we are going for the rapture there is what sin does there is a damage that seems to us in the church there are consequences when the lamb is is with the living that lamb to stay without in the living we are saying like the bible is saying here it must be part the level must be purged out of the church may the name of the glory fine now i was just looking a little bit uh sometime and seeing what makes the the charge to compromise what makes a charge to lower the standard what makes the believers lower the standards you realize that people start very well we today we have the methodists the methodists never begun the way they are today we have the pentecostals the original preachers of the pentecost never preached what we are seeing among the pentacles today right now i'm reading a book about the about the azusa street pentecostal revival look at the principles that those people stood for look at what we see today today among the better councils we are having which wish doctors these are witches these are not christians these are thieves these are people freezing people out of their their money they never begun like that but there was a compromise and the compromise came because people saw things going wrong but they never bothered right that's right you are passive about it and sometimes you hear people talking about the church and saying okay i don't care about what anybody else is doing all right all i care is about my soul i care about my heart if my heart is light i with my god fine no you should care about what is happening around you because this is a lamp and it will affect you eventually to affect you it will bring proper problem to you sin does not weaken only the sinner it awakens even the people that are in the fellowship with you amen it brings weakness it brings defeat in the church and that's why this islam must be kept without in the living that's why every living must be purged may the name of that be glorified that's the reason why it must be paged now let us see some of the consequences things that happen when that one is not done uh let me get this squad here tonight i'm not going to preach much i'm just almost finishing but i have got a point here to to hammer before we come to the head of this service i arrived when i was very hungry and master one took me somewhere i almost ate off my my salmon okay and now after you are eh that doesn't mean that okay um and now after you are in that don't mean that you are out free from war right you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on glory to god i have with me a message that i call why do christians suffer why do we believe our server why when there is covered and we bring this is when we believe this is god judgment coming upon this evil evil world why do believers also die yeah why when we have believed god we have accepted god we are walking well we are working right with god then why do we suffer yeah problem is saying that when they got into the into in this area there was still war but i'm not on that so see currently not represent the great heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and fightings and so forth but it really represents this that it must be a perfect work glory be to god amen now this message is a holiness message the church of the message is a holiness church we must have this perfect work there is where the church is feeling today feeling is that the perfect work work there is this there is where the the the church is failing today on that walk do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed why should this even stay why should this alarm stay without living because when there is a living which is seen then your misbehavior my misbehavior will prevent somebody we pray for here to be healed when one commits seen here in this lamp and then makes this whole lamp even we are the whole group is weakened it affects the whole group if you put little even in this corner it will affect the other every part of this lamp therefore when one man misbehaves when one person doesn't walk right what happens we are weakened we are defeated emily once again do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed you are misbehaving of unconfirmed sins of you believers let me have as i sin if it is committed if it happens i'm not going to say that no sin will ever be committed in this church things will be committed why do i say that even the very church of jesus christ himself the word there was a thief there was somebody stealing is that correct right in his church judas was a thief is that what the bible says he was stealing this church of fast accordance was at the paw and you can see the condition they got itself into sin will be there shouldn't you be there people will do things in the church people would do wrong people would you know will be behave that's why we may not stop that one may not avoid you may preach sermons of fire and brimstone you can threaten and do whatever you want to do but people still do wrong but where we may be guilty is when we don't do what we are supposed to do if sin is committed let it be confessed that there be confession of sins let people feel guilty let people repent yes we are talking we are not talking about sinners we are talking about the believers they must repent and let me say here if anybody has seen let us not rest until he repents that sin yes just get concerned about it let's not be passive about it may the name of the lord be glorified if i commit sin i'm obligated to confess my sin because there is something blasphemy is calling here unconfessed sin you search in the message that condition you see what my mom talks about it what it does you see because that unconfessing is the living and it is now affecting the whole body it's affecting the whole lamb so here robin says here can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior or unconscious off and confess the sins you of you believers not of the sinners but of you believers can cause this church to bitterly fail amen that's why i'm preaching about it and even brahman says here it should be preached and at the day of the judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it all you say now with the many problems well that's the truth think of it now i am emphasizing on this point bitterly fail why are we failing not because of many people we don't have to get to this condition of this church of home not to get into that impunity of sin and everything else not becoming so common just one scene it was not a commons just a very and look at the the type of the scene just taking the babylonian garment and the wage just that just helping himself here they were conquering a nation he was a congregation they had beaten them and now he sees something good and puts it in his pocket he was not supposed to do that that alone you can see what it cost now i'm talking this to tell the believers that we should not be passive about sins listen how when do we in what circumstances do we kind of cover up sin most like most likely is among our people among our children among our wife among our husbands you cover your husband you cover your wife you cover your children your children are regarded as believers i'm being baptized you just dismiss these adjust children they'll learn how to work but as long as they are believers and they start smoking they start drugs they are doing all those kinds of things and they are coming to church here and they are taking communion that will make us to bitterly fail there are people who protect their people their friends that that the heart of the pastor cannot reach them so that he can discipline them there must be display in the church if sin is committed it must be made sure that it is confessed if not that is going to make us bitterly fail to make us to be to fail now uh on and on there are other other judgments you will be responsible for every bit of it you say now with america well that's the truth think of it joshua after he crossed over into the lord god gave him the promise to fight an entire campaign without a losing man let me tell you people some of the things that we go through example a problem which go through is not a mask we can even live without problems we can live in such a victory yes we can if it happened at one time it can happen again the god of the children is still our god today is that light look at these people two million people coming out of egypt they didn't have doctors among them they didn't have any food with them but they crossed that area from the from egypt to the promised land i've been privileged to to to travel through that area by bus through from kailua to to jerusalem and i'm telling you that region that area you won't even find a blade of grass it's desert and i really wondered how god led his people along that line but he did today today get the people about and remember those were two million people today get people just one hundred thousand and get them together somewhere i remember when there was problem in radar there was an exodus of people from rudder on foot and they crossed over into into congo and within one week or just a few days every day they were lining up corpses of people along the road to be collected thousands of people are dying every day out of colera because there's no water there's no food and all that and here is god taking two million people through the desert and there is no river between egypt and the only liver you get is jordan i'm telling the children that were born in the desert or in the journey they saw the fasting river when they were 40 years in children there's no reason around that religion but god came to them god fed them god closed them god did it that's our god that's a god we believe in i'm telling you if we can keep this lamb without living anything can happen we can have victory we can defeat our circumstances whatever comes allowed us we can defeat it but that all that god wants us to do is to keep the islam without living when things do work and blah blah is talking about joshua he fought he was in the war and he says joshua after he crossed over into the left god gave him the promise joy nothing to fight an entire campaign without losing a man without even losing a man america has a very strong army is very very good i believe is the most equipped army in the world i have seen many documentaries about america army america in afghanistan america where where is rwanda and everywhere i may not read about somalia and many parts of the world very very equipped but there is no other fight without bodybugs as much as that way equip that when strong that way still people die but look at these people they were fighting a war and nobody was going to die nobody was going to die josh after i cross over into them without losing a man without even getting a scratch without having to have an ass or a fasted or a bad amen god said the lord is yours to fight think of fighting a campaign and there is no red cross around at all there is nobody going to get hurt that's how successful that's our victorious there are tonight i'm saying if we really want to have the same kind of a victory let us keep this islam without living we shall have the victory amen and this and this they slayed the amorites and hit it but there wasn't one heart among any of them until seen come in the camp oh let us not have seen in the camp until sin came where in the camp and when arkham took that babylonian garment and that gold wedge and held it under his his camp then the next day they launched 16 he meant that the six people joshua said stop wait a minute there is something wrong something is wrong here we are going to call seven days of fast god made us to a promise there will be nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at our feet and there is something wrong here something went wrong somewhere because we got 16 dead man laying here they are israelites why did they die innocent man because one man stepped out of line brother what are you preaching tonight i'm preaching let us stay in the line getting out of the line has consequences terrible consequences this one man brought the death of 36 innocent they were not aware of what was happening but they died why did they die innocent man because one man stepped out of line you see this on this needs to be taught you see reason why this need to be taught sometimes i was thinking that this someone is very hard to preach to another pastor's church it's like i'm rebuking a church and i'm a visitor you know just somebody comes jumps from the plane and comes and brings a message like this one instead of something nice just to make people feel good but when i saw what i'm saying you see why this need to be taught i think it needs to be taught in every message church we need to hear that may the name of the glorifier yeah lining up with with each other the church lining up leaning up with the word of god landing up with god and lining up with each other working perfectly upright so ballet before all man fearing god because one man stole a garment and done something that he should not have done took the life of sixteen man i think it was uh sixteen maybe more i believe it was simon was dead george accord said there is something wrong god made the promise and something is wrong when we bring the sick up before us and they fail to be healed why do we have to bury everybody that dies in our east over the years i was speak preaching this in my church and i was asking them this church has been there since 1974 everybody the anybody that has died we have married in all those years why shouldn't we have had enough faith enough at least to have two raised from the dead why are we so defeated we cancer comes on one of us we watch as that person dies away there's ways away there should be something wrong when we bring the sick before us and they fail to he be healed we need to call us all in fast call an assembly something is wrong somewhere god made the promise god's got to stick to that promise and he'll do it he called her first and they fouled out may the name of the autograph now i'm just finishing now i'm just going to say this and then did one one or two quotes here and then finish now uh if we had time i could just say more but i'm just putting my someone short but the mom talks about this lady this lady was kind of like she was a she had some mental problems and brabant tried to pray for her she could not never get healed and the problem was still continuing and still going on and she was not getting well at all until abraham didn't know why you know what was happening [Music] but then one day when she came again to be prayed for then prabham saw a vision he saw that this lady when her husband went to i think germany she went and eloped and seen with another man with a man now and this scene was in her life and therefore problem came and talked to her told her what he had seen and she said oh don't you ever tell my husband tell no you have to confess that to your husband she said if i did that we are going to to divorce and we have got some children he said okay it's up to you now know what to do and just once they were on that ramp said wait a minute i can see even your husband when he went up there in germany he also did the same thing he still needs to confess to you and not only that one a few days ago he was in it with a woman in his place of work so go and get your husband so she went and got a husband and they went aside sat somewhere and each one of them confessed to the other now after that prabhan prayed for her and she was perfectly healed these are the words i wanted to hear what balabam said brabham said we start seeing in her life unconfessed no matter how much oil you poured on her she could never be healed another place he said no matter how much you stomp no matter how much you shout no matter how much you kick that demon can never leave because it has been given some legitimacy it has been given some right there that demon of unconfessing brethren you don't know what and confessions are doing in our church they are taking away the anointing they are taken away our victory amen may the name of the lord be glorified in another place he said now to get seen away from us sin must be confessed if you see a brother doing something go to him is up to you not up to the pastor you hear people talking about saying oh you know the deacons have left things people are just doing whatever they want and they're not asking them they're not doing anything about it it's not the deacons it's not the pastor it's you that have seen you that has seen that something is done wrong you are supposed to see that person talk to him why are you talking to him not to condemn him no but you want to help him to get out of that scene because even that scene will affect you so say the brother see the sister talk to her talk to him maybe you saw him drunks talk to him if he can see his sin and confesses his sin and depends wonderful that matter is there but if you just see and leave it problem says even you'll be responsible even yourself because you have seen it so it's not only my sin that i confess not only you are seeing that you have to confess but if you see somebody else as the bible says see him in that way we keep the islam without living brahman said if we don't do that what is going to happen the church will become so cold and he said the janitor will need to come and break the ice to have a service you wonder sometimes why we cannot worship sometimes we cannot feel the presence of god in the church something wrong has been committed somewhere and the living has entered into the lamp and has leavened the lamp seal must be dealt with salary yeah it is destroying us it's damaging us it's weakening us it's taking our victory away the victory of the church this is a chart that is supposed to be so powerful because this is a one charge this one is this is a church that should be seeing the arks acts being repeated once again there is nothing to stop that but we've got to keep the living off the lamp finally i'm sorry i'm taking i've taken some time let me just quit i'm just with this quote it's too close and then i'm done and the member of the church let me start here the minister has got a place of duty to stand and preach the unsearchable riches of christ without compromising yeah we preachers we have we don't have to compromise with our work the truth we must preach the truth there are many people who want to not to follow the truth and they want to be called church members there are many people that want to be in the church but they don't want to leave the word of god we should not compromise at all we should not fear to preach what is right which is what is the word amen if he has got to be a preacher he wouldn't spare one thing for one person if he's got to be a preacher amen yeah and the member of the church is going to be a member of this certain group then he would not compromise even a member should never compromise if the church believes that we should not gobble then that member should never touch a deck of cards you know the things that you are taught here you know what this church started for to be the truth to be the word of god no matter should we contrary to that i don't know how it is allowed here but we have a big problem in our country and the problem comes about football in europe england and all over europe this is the the these uh these are the things that our our young people watch and they have their support some are as ascendant or some for this and for this and sometimes they fight over that you cannot imagine football being played in england and people are fighting in a village over that they are so taken up by that football so there are companies that have come up for gobbling betting betting and we have a lot of problem in the church some young people get into betting you spend the money they borrow the money sometimes they get you to stealing that's what the government does it becomes a addiction addiction gathering if the church does not believe in gobbling no one should touch a deck of a card in a choice this that member should never touch a deck of cards we don't believe in drinking he should turn his head completely from drinking if we do not believe in gobbling or smoking the member of this church will never touch such a thing god gives complete deliverance praise the name of the lord we should never we should keep the word as it is preached by the pastor here in this church the pastor studies the world he knows what is the correct thing and he believes that things you must leave live according to that standard don't break that word now okay oh let's stop just one more minute here in heavenly places now just not out anywhere but in heavenly places we are celebrating in heavenly places would you love to assemble in heavenly places shouldn't that be our desire when we come together here we just worship in heavenly words places we are celebrating heavenly heavenly it means that the possession of the believer that if i am prayed up you are prayed up or the church is prayed up and we are ready for the message and we have assembled ourselves together as saints called out baptized with the holy ghost fear these god's blessings called elected set together in heavenly places now we are heavenly in our souls our spirit has brought us into a heavenly atmosphere oh brother there you are a heavenly atmosphere what could happen tonight what could happen tonight you will be sitting here in a heavenly atmosphere and the holy spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in christ jesus listen all sins out of the blood amen that's what i'm talking about tonight all things under there the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to god and our hearts lifted sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus worshiping together in heavenly places did you ever sit in one or i have said till i would weep for joy and see god never let me live here just heavenly places in christ jesus blessing us with what divine healing knowledge revelation visions powers tongues interpretations wisdom knowledge all the heavenly blessings and joy unspeakable and full of glory every heart filled with the spirit working together sitting together in heavenly places listen not one evil thought among us not one cigarette smoked not one short dress sometimes you look in the church you wonder these girls here have been baptized and they are taking communion and then they are wearing short dresses why you along that mother why are you learning that you allow me to speak like i'm speaking to my church when you came out from your house as a mother you didn't see that you that dress was shot i'm seeing you sitting there very comfortably and the dress is very short did you see it when you were when your daughter was getting into the car not one shot at this sometimes you find that our sisters are over things those sisters that are walking in the office you see people blow at you oh you show a long dress you're not an old woman you're not what why are you wearing this wrong dress you are sweeping the floor in the office and then that gets into you and then you fight you have a dresses for the church and some dresses for the office a little bit shorter you are beginning to compromise a bad spirit is starting to come in you you want to to start changing the faith of the message believers the main faith of the messenger device is that it's not that our study is to wear long dresses covering your body not tight presses i've heard there are some sisters who have some a pair of trousers to relax at home some pair of trousers just to hang around sweeping around the home but you don't go out with it but when you're just around there you have a pair of trousers and you justify it's just to make me relax you know that's the beginning of changing our faith may god help us not one second is smoked not one shortness not one this that or the other not one evil thought nobody got anything against one another everybody speaking in love and harmony everybody with one accord in one place then suddenly they come from heaven and sound like a rushing mighty weed there you are has blessed us with all spiritual blessings then the holy spirit might fall upon somebody in such a circumstance in such atmosphere you cannot go wrong for a long time before the holy ghost falls on somebody and then what happens and say that says a lot go to a certain place and do a certain thing which it happened just like that that says the lord do a certain thing at a certain place we should happen like that blessed us with heavenly together in heavenly places in heavenly blessings in heavenly places would you have to have such an atmosphere then let the living be pudged let the lamb be pudged let us get rid of the living and make this lamb without living may the lord bless you let's pray heavenly father we thank you lord god for your goodness and mercy father the desires of our heart is lord to have such an atmosphere it will have such a church such an assembly such believers coming to church living further out there and living for you and standing for your world standing for your truth lord and when we come together then your presence father is here and your glory is upon us granted every father this is our prayer we commit father every heart here in your hands we pray for that everybody here will confess his sins lord everybody will make every sin of the blood and then when you come together here father there is no living in the lamp the lamb that believeth has been punished and the living is clean lord and your glory and your victory is upon us we thank you and you commit everything in your hands in the name of jesus christ our lord amen amen amen [Music] bring their birthdays and yeah yes this is your house this is your heart [Music] first john chapter 1 verse 7 and if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son claims us from all sins if we say we that we have no sin we deceive ourself and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us now if there is one thing i would want i would love for us to take from the service tonight as brother peterson read that quote from the uh efficient series but branham says here is where the church is feeling on that walk and what he underlined is the misbehavior and what is the misbehavior the misbehavior is our failure of confessing our sins [Music] a believer a child of god must never go before the father and forget that we must never go before the father even if you don't step out of your house even if you just lock yourself up in the in the room the 24 hours of the day when you get before the father we must never forget about that that is the misbehavior of the church the believer arriving to the place where he start to nurse in his mind that he had never done anything wrong he don't need because as soon as you get into that channel and start seeking god mercy oh god be merciful upon me if i ever taught anything i've ever said anything you fall right into the channel where you start to think about other people you just have to be compassionate even if someone hurts you it's easy for you to get to the place to start praying for that person [Music] that's where the church is feeling and i believe that's what the holy spirit wants to underline for us let me say this to you if you remember we just coming from a communion service why would god bring a message like this we just from a communion service sunday evening [Music] why would it please the holy spirit to bring a message like this [Music] like brother peterson said he's like god and i pick him up right after 5 p.m talking for something to eat right to the church we came you think about it think about unliving bread think about living thinking about jesus being our passover when we are just stepping out of a communion service i think what sometimes as believers especially our young people we get answers to walk up here and take the communion and we don't become conscious parents is your is your duty i love the holy spirit speaking that out you're supposed to watch over your child you're supposed to guide them you're supposed to conscious them it's your god giving responsibility if there are things to talk about unless it is above you and you need our help we will step into help but what i want to re-echo to you tonight the scripture says if we confess our sins he is faithful he will ever remain faithful [Music] the brother shares there's the christian bar of soap the christian bar of soap is to confess your sin then the lord used the water of the word to wash you [Music] that is the misbehavior that the church has got in [Music] let's stand on our feet tonight this is your heart come and do it we are your house we are your house father come and dwell we are your house [Music] i'm [Music] i [Music] let just thank the lord tonight for speaking to us in a way that only he can heavenly father we want to be grateful to you tonight lord father god we just left our house to you we lift our hands to god we come lord father surrounding ourselves lord to your word of god precious jesus we just want to thank you tonight father dear holy spirit god we pray precious lord jesus just love father god as you have discerned our needs to god and you have brought your word tonight father we pray to god we pray lord jesus oh father that you will just have mercy upon us who god lord father jesus as your people as your children lord father god lord in in whichever way lord father o god and thanks lord we are entertaining in our lives in our home so god father lord in our conversations lord jesus father god lord we just lift ourselves to you father we laid ourselves out of the altar tonight of god and we say father we seek your mercy lord jesus we say father god for the visible audience love the invisible audience tonight oh god we commit your people father honor your blood lord jesus oh father just like daniel confess his sins lord in the sins of the people oh god oh father lord jesus we stand in the gap tonight and we say father have mercy lord jesus christ oh father god lord we would love to have a church oh father god that we experience lord a heavenly atmosphere and lord god we say without doubt over and over lord you have visited us oh god your presence lord jesus has been real your presence has been true for god we thank you for the things that lord you are doing in our midst lord we thank you father oh god for the house you are bringing to convey conviction lord we prayed in the name of the lord jesus we just asked tonight our father you will take complete control lord oh we surrounded ourselves to your god we commit our soul our body our spirit father lord from the pulpit of god to the pure lord jesus the musicians lord the technicians who god the ushers of lord the deacons of god the brothers the sisters lord the children father lord we lift ourselves to you tonight father and say oh god we are so grateful father lord we just thank you tonight lord god oh blessed be your holy name every praise lord every glory father every honor jesus oh god we thank you lord we thank you lord jesus we thank you father lord we thank you savior divine we glorify you lord jesus oh blessed be your holy name bring conviction to our hearts tonight father we thank you precious lord we thank you jesus we thank you lord every praise every glory and honor belongs to you in jesus name we pray amen amen let the church say amen praise the lord amen let the church say amen let's just sing that to the lord tonight let the church see yes let the church let the church one more time oh let the church sit amen to your word lord god let the church said god had spoken [Music] yes let the church [Music] church god has spoken let the church praise the lord let's remember that the holy spirit don't want that misbehavior in our life because he knows we can't help ourself [Music] but whenever you cry to the father and say lord have mercy at very end and presumptuous saying if there is anything lord you give the holy spirit charge over your life to even revere to you what you are not conscious of because the believers will never walk conscious in sin [Music] the scripture says the believer won't parch and there is no desire there is no there is no consciousness but sometimes we are calling things that we are not conscious of i suggest lay for your hand lord have mercy be merciful be merciful that is the underlying misbehavior that god don't want in his church because if we say we have no sin we make him a liar there is one thing or another that he want to bring our attention to [Music] let the church say amen thank you lord let the whole church sit here god have spoken you we will see you on sunday and uh let's go in the peace of the lord pray for me i have a pretty busy week i pray for you also and we look forward to meet you on sunday congratulations brother peterson yeah when he was here the last time we had to talk about his marriage [Music] you know he was married his wife went to be with the lord and as he keeps the pastoral office he fed the knee that he needed companion so that's what he was talking about and we're glad that god was able to make provision praise the lord now you will see and understand why it would be high on on the church in louisiana with brother team prawn because you never get to understand that you never never get to understand that let's continue to pray for the team and and all the believers that are dealing with this situation amen let's sing this chorus i will stay right honor the blood the lord bless you we are dismissed in jesus name no harm and the devil can do me no harm when we stay under the blood and all sin is under the blood all believer is under the blood the devil can do us no harm amen i'm gonna stay right on the block [Music] oh i'm gonna stay right [Music] me [Applause] oh oh i will [Music] oh [Music] no [Applause] [Music] i'm gonna stay [Music] oh i'm gonna say [Music] now [Music] if we stay under the blood that's what sin is dead with amen no unconfessed thing can stay under the blood praise the lord there's a place that we can state and the devil can do us no harm that's right honor the blood under the bleeding word the principle of the bleeding word is the blood of jesus christ for our day god bless you let's go in the peace of the lord so [Music] you
