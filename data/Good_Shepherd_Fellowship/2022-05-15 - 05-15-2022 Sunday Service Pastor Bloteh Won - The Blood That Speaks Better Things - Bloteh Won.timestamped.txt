[52:12] the lord bless you you may have your
[52:13] seat
[52:15] you may have your seat praise the lord
[52:18] amen
[52:19] now now uh uh when the wednesday night
[52:22] service
[52:24] uh we
[52:25] we had
[52:27] we were talking uh
[52:29] on a high priest
[52:31] that can be touched by the feelings of
[52:33] our infirmities
[52:35] and
[52:37] [Music]
[52:38] last sunday we started talking about the
[52:41] the road of the priests the work of the
[52:43] priest standing between the living and
[52:44] the dead and then how
[52:47] the priests become effective
[52:50] when
[52:51] when he can uh
[52:53] [Music]
[52:55] feed for the people
[52:57] we know that that is that is just in the
[52:59] shadow
[53:00] but but like like the apostle paul said
[53:03] here
[53:04] and and we read in in hebrew
[53:07] chapter 5
[53:10] he talks about how
[53:14] verse 1 for every high priest taken from
[53:17] a more man is ordained for men
[53:20] in things pertaining to god that he may
[53:24] offer both gifts and sacrifice for sin
[53:30] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[53:33] and on them that are out of the way
[53:36] talking about the priests
[53:37] for that he himself also
[53:40] is compassed with infirmities now so
[53:44] that's the limitation
[53:46] of the priest that is among men that is
[53:48] different from
[53:50] uh
[53:51] the the priesthood of our lord jesus
[53:53] christ
[53:55] praise the lord because the priest among
[53:57] man he himself he's compassed
[54:00] with uh
[54:01] with uh
[54:02] infirmities
[54:05] that is the reason why he have to offer
[54:08] uh sin for the people i mean sacrifice
[54:11] for the people and sacrifice for himself
[54:14] and uh and and yeah and paul brings this
[54:17] out you see that in the book of hebrew
[54:20] where paul brings it out and he and he
[54:23] talks about
[54:24] uh bulls and goats
[54:26] you know bulls and goats
[54:28] it is is uh
[54:30] uh uh i mean paul brings it out in that
[54:33] way just like i said to just show the
[54:36] difference between the priest's
[54:39] sacrifice and the people sacrifice
[54:42] the priests have to bring abort
[54:45] very big
[54:47] praise the lord it shows that the
[54:49] priest's life is is in public
[54:53] the people brings a goat
[54:55] they can bring a little kid put it under
[54:57] the arm you can put a bull under your
[54:59] arm
[55:01] praise the lord
[55:02] so uh
[55:04] so
[55:05] just like we we were trying to to to say
[55:08] it and and you know and help us to
[55:10] understand
[55:11] paul was trying to bring to
[55:15] uh the hebrew believers the hebrew
[55:18] christians
[55:19] you know the the those those jewish
[55:22] believers that that believe
[55:25] the gospel he was trying to make them to
[55:28] understand
[55:29] how true jesus
[55:34] that was given
[55:36] from our father abraham and through the
[55:39] prophets through jesus they have all
[55:43] become
[55:44] better
[55:46] praise the lord
[55:47] through jesus they have all become
[55:50] better everything
[55:53] that god
[55:54] has promised
[55:56] everything that he had given us
[55:58] everything that was foreshadowed in the
[56:01] old testament so on on wednesday night i
[56:05] i throw uh uh an assignment to you i
[56:08] don't know whether you were able to look
[56:09] at it but
[56:11] we uh
[56:12] we want to look through the book of
[56:14] hebrew now we will go very fast with
[56:16] this not to take much of our time
[56:19] but it is is so
[56:21] it's very so important i mean wednesday
[56:23] night i was talking and while we were
[56:25] reading the hebrew chapter one if you
[56:28] remember we got down there to verse 4
[56:32] and he was talking about jesus he was
[56:35] talking paul was talking about how god
[56:38] in sondra times
[56:40] spoke through the prophets
[56:42] but in this last day he has spoken
[56:45] through his son
[56:47] now so you you go through every chapter
[56:50] you see paul
[56:52] showing to the jews that god gave us a
[56:55] prophet
[56:56] but
[56:57] there was one greater and better than
[57:00] the prophet
[57:02] praise the lord
[57:03] so all of those things that the jews
[57:06] believe in and had told dearly paul was
[57:10] trying to show them that
[57:12] it was just a type of a better one
[57:18] god spoke to us through the prophets
[57:22] but in this last day we have heard a
[57:25] better voice
[57:30] praise the lord
[57:32] in verse 4 he says
[57:35] uh uh he's he's going to make an
[57:37] expression here
[57:40] being made so much better
[57:43] talking about the sun being made so much
[57:46] better
[57:48] than the injured
[57:49] now so that that was the verse i was
[57:51] reading and then i make the comment of
[57:53] the different better things that paul
[57:55] talks about i didn't realize it until i
[57:57] i went back home and i started studying
[57:59] it i mean the holy spirit just kept that
[58:02] thing on my mind and and i just couldn't
[58:04] sleep i i just lie there then and says i
[58:07] have to look at this
[58:08] it amazed me to realize that uh there
[58:12] are 12 different times
[58:15] 12
[58:17] different times
[58:18] that paul
[58:20] used better
[58:22] and 12 different things he applied to
[58:26] and then was what the thing that
[58:28] impressed me is the other
[58:30] i mean it is not just
[58:32] uh uh i mean this book is written
[58:36] by
[58:38] there's a divine design that is in this
[58:40] book
[58:43] praise the lord
[58:45] amen
[58:47] i mean it's just all over the scripture
[58:50] now yeri said that that paul is
[58:52] addressing
[58:54] the jewish church
[58:57] praise the lord
[58:59] and we know that uh
[59:02] you know
[59:03] god has uh you know has always there
[59:05] with the jews like that 12 tribes
[59:09] when he came he called 12 of them as an
[59:11] apostle
[59:13] praise the lord
[59:19] revelation chapter 12 that talks about
[59:22] uh uh uh you know the the the woman with
[59:25] uh uh uh the the moon and the sun that
[59:29] represent the jewish church is a type of
[59:31] the jewish church passing from law to
[59:34] grace
[59:40] and yeah
[59:41] that that the apostle paul
[59:44] writing his own letter to the jewish
[59:47] church
[59:49] where he's now addressing
[59:52] trying to bring light to the torah that
[59:55] was given to them by moses
[1:00:01] it has to be god
[1:00:05] praise the lord
[1:00:12] so in chapter one verse four we just
[1:00:14] read that he talks about better than an
[1:00:16] angel
[1:00:17] chapter six
[1:00:19] verse nine
[1:00:21] he talks about
[1:00:24] being things uh uh better
[1:00:26] things that accompany salvation let's
[1:00:30] let's look at that quickly
[1:00:32] i could just run through and call all of
[1:00:34] these but uh uh that the emphasis will
[1:00:37] be missed praise the lord
[1:00:40] because sometimes the people just
[1:00:41] listening to the preacher they don't go
[1:00:43] back in and follow up
[1:00:45] and uh and and read those things
[1:00:49] praise the lord
[1:00:53] so that's chapter six verse 9
[1:00:56] he talks here in and he says but beloved
[1:01:00] we are persuaded better things of you
[1:01:04] and things that accompany
[1:01:07] salvation
[1:01:08] we of course the old covenant could not
[1:01:12] give them
[1:01:15] there are things that accompany
[1:01:16] salvation
[1:01:20] praise the lord
[1:01:22] what are some other things that are
[1:01:23] accompanying salvation the baptism of
[1:01:25] the holy ghost
[1:01:27] they never had it under the old covenant
[1:01:32] praise the lord
[1:01:34] they were only limited to animal
[1:01:36] sacrifice
[1:01:38] of which the animal blood they have to
[1:01:40] do it over and over and over but there
[1:01:43] is a better thing that accompanies
[1:01:45] salvation
[1:01:47] that there is one sacrifice and the life
[1:01:50] of that sacrifice can come back on the
[1:01:52] believer and change our life forever
[1:02:00] there is better things
[1:02:02] that accompany salvation that's what
[1:02:04] makes it so sweet
[1:02:06] amen
[1:02:08] praise the lord
[1:02:10] better things that i accompany salvation
[1:02:12] not just church membership
[1:02:15] praise the lord not just church
[1:02:17] membership
[1:02:20] now belonging to a church and putting
[1:02:22] your name down on the book i'm talking
[1:02:24] about a life change
[1:02:27] i'm talking about divine healing
[1:02:31] i'm talking about
[1:02:32] deliverance better things that accompany
[1:02:35] salvation
[1:02:36] [Music]
[1:02:40] that's the difference between salvation
[1:02:42] and religion
[1:02:50] let's go
[1:02:51] 7 chapter 7 verse 7
[1:02:55] oh
[1:02:56] my goodness
[1:02:58] praise the lord
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:08] chapter 7 verse 7 let's drop back to
[1:03:10] verse 4 so you can get the picture now
[1:03:12] consider how great this man was
[1:03:15] unto whom even the patriarch abraham
[1:03:18] gave the tenth of the sport and now he's
[1:03:21] talking about uh mechazetic
[1:03:24] amen he says and verily did that uh of
[1:03:28] the sons of levi who who receive the
[1:03:32] office of the priests who have a
[1:03:33] commandment to take tithes
[1:03:36] of the people are calling to the lord
[1:03:39] that is of their brethren
[1:03:42] though they come out of the lands of
[1:03:44] abraham
[1:03:46] but he whose the sin is not counted
[1:03:50] from them received tithes of abraham now
[1:03:54] he's separating
[1:03:56] the difference between the levitica
[1:03:58] priesthood and the mechasadic priesthood
[1:04:01] amen
[1:04:02] then he says uh receipt out of abraham
[1:04:04] and bless him
[1:04:06] that had the promises
[1:04:08] and without all contradiction
[1:04:12] the less
[1:04:15] is bless
[1:04:17] of the better
[1:04:20] praise the lord
[1:04:24] we could get a little bit uh
[1:04:27] uh uh
[1:04:28] trap in there let me let me read that a
[1:04:31] little bit out of the amplifier so you
[1:04:34] you'll be able to get the the
[1:04:35] understanding there the amplifier
[1:04:37] translation says but this person who has
[1:04:41] not the levitica
[1:04:44] ancestry received tithe from abraham
[1:04:47] himself
[1:04:48] and bless him who possess the promise of
[1:04:51] god yet
[1:04:54] it is beyond all contradiction
[1:04:58] that it is the lesser person
[1:05:02] who
[1:05:03] is
[1:05:04] better than the greater one
[1:05:10] praise the lord
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:14] so he's talking about uh uh
[1:05:18] uh
[1:05:20] uh in in the in the levitical priesthood
[1:05:24] all of these ordinances will be
[1:05:26] established you know uh uh the the
[1:05:28] paying the tithes and all of that and
[1:05:30] and it will carry on it will come up to
[1:05:32] full light but we have to realize that
[1:05:35] uh
[1:05:37] that levi
[1:05:39] paid tithe
[1:05:41] why being in the lens of abraham which
[1:05:44] of course we will realize there was four
[1:05:47] generations back
[1:05:51] because it was abraham in his lions
[1:05:53] abraham would bring isaac isaac would
[1:05:55] bring jacob
[1:05:57] then jacob would bring levi
[1:06:00] so four generations back
[1:06:03] and that's the reason why that prophet
[1:06:04] of god will tell you uh right from the
[1:06:07] pre-de uh from from uh uh uh right back
[1:06:10] from the foundation of the word you know
[1:06:12] what god hired you in in your mind but
[1:06:14] you never came to to to attention or
[1:06:18] attraction in god's mind until back in
[1:06:20] your full generation
[1:06:24] that god starts to keep his eyes on you
[1:06:29] praise the lord
[1:06:31] now let's let's uh let's move on because
[1:06:34] we can
[1:06:35] we can spend the whole night on this
[1:06:37] verse 19 right there in the same chapter
[1:06:40] 7
[1:06:42] the lesser is better
[1:06:44] than the greater
[1:06:49] verse 19
[1:06:55] he talks here also
[1:06:57] verse 18 for there is verily
[1:07:01] a disannoyment of the commandment going
[1:07:03] before
[1:07:04] for the weakness and on profitableness
[1:07:07] thereof for the lord
[1:07:10] made nothing perfect
[1:07:13] amen
[1:07:14] it was only an expression of what was in
[1:07:17] god's mind
[1:07:21] god was on it expressing what was in his
[1:07:23] mind so you think about it think about
[1:07:27] what is powerful
[1:07:29] the thought
[1:07:31] the word
[1:07:34] or the manifestation
[1:07:41] praise the lord
[1:07:44] well you can think about it
[1:07:48] for the law make nothing perfect
[1:07:52] but
[1:07:54] they're bringing in of a better
[1:07:58] hope
[1:08:01] it gives us
[1:08:02] an expectation what to look forward to
[1:08:08] it brings in the bringing in of a better
[1:08:11] hope
[1:08:13] praise the lord
[1:08:15] amen
[1:08:16] by the witch we draw night
[1:08:19] unto god
[1:08:21] verse 22
[1:08:23] of the same chapter
[1:08:26] amen
[1:08:34] verse 22
[1:08:36] by so much that jesus
[1:08:39] made a surety
[1:08:42] of a better testament
[1:08:46] praise the lord
[1:08:47] but robert wilson spoke here on easter
[1:08:50] when he talks about
[1:08:54] the test theater in the testament
[1:08:57] amen
[1:09:00] the testament
[1:09:01] is is not in fact until
[1:09:05] the tested or die
[1:09:08] because the testament is the will of the
[1:09:10] testator
[1:09:13] praise the lord
[1:09:15] so what paul is saying here is that
[1:09:18] jesus brought us a better testament
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:23] because moses brought the old testament
[1:09:25] uh uh the plates and and uh he broke it
[1:09:28] the first time he went back and bring it
[1:09:30] again and and then i left it with the
[1:09:32] people and then i mean and he was
[1:09:35] ticking
[1:09:36] but when jesus brought his testament
[1:09:39] praise to the lord
[1:09:42] after
[1:09:43] he died
[1:09:45] to release the will of the testament he
[1:09:48] rose again to come back and back up thy
[1:09:51] will
[1:09:54] praise the lord
[1:09:58] glory be to god
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:02] so he jesus brought us a shortage of a
[1:10:05] better testament
[1:10:06] glory be to god
[1:10:09] chapter 8 verse 6.
[1:10:17] but now have he obtained a more
[1:10:20] excellent ministry
[1:10:22] but how much also he is a mediator
[1:10:26] of a better coveting
[1:10:30] a better
[1:10:31] coveting
[1:10:34] which is established upon better
[1:10:38] promises
[1:10:42] praise the lord amen
[1:10:47] because you see that's what happened in
[1:10:49] in in the early church
[1:10:51] you have to realize that just like how
[1:10:55] mao mean brought roof into the land of
[1:10:58] israel
[1:11:01] forbes to marry her
[1:11:03] and also redeem everything that now
[1:11:06] milos
[1:11:07] that is the same way the gospel had to
[1:11:10] come through the land of
[1:11:12] of of the jews
[1:11:14] to be able to get us as a as a gentile
[1:11:18] bride
[1:11:21] are we together
[1:11:23] praise the lord so you see that when the
[1:11:26] when when the electro after the holy
[1:11:28] ghost came and and and those disciples
[1:11:31] you know uh uh the words started coming
[1:11:34] to to to life
[1:11:36] the first time you can see peter
[1:11:38] standing right out there and says this
[1:11:41] is that wish the prophet joel spoke
[1:11:43] about he was able to find something that
[1:11:45] he can relate the old testament tool
[1:11:49] so the word started coming to life
[1:11:52] this is what we've been reading all of
[1:11:54] these years but you see when people
[1:11:57] are bound to crease and when people are
[1:12:00] bound to church dogmas
[1:12:03] the early church struggle as chapter 15
[1:12:06] that's what happened because now
[1:12:09] gentiles were believing after peter went
[1:12:11] and preached to the gentiles in acts
[1:12:13] chapter 10 and they received the holy
[1:12:15] ghost
[1:12:17] praise the lord
[1:12:18] but you have to realize all of their
[1:12:21] life they have not associated with
[1:12:23] gentiles
[1:12:26] gentiles have not come into their temple
[1:12:28] they have not gone into gentiles
[1:12:30] playgrounds
[1:12:33] now so there was a struggle in the back
[1:12:36] part of their mind
[1:12:38] is this thing really of god
[1:12:44] peter struggled in a vision
[1:12:46] peter eat he said no i'm not eating
[1:12:48] nothing unclean
[1:12:50] the angel said peter eat he said no
[1:12:54] now god was going to show peter the
[1:12:57] thing that he would struggle with
[1:13:02] after he realized that the gentile
[1:13:04] received the holy ghost you know what
[1:13:06] peter said if you if you go back in acts
[1:13:08] chapter 15
[1:13:10] peter said
[1:13:11] that i wish that we we jews received the
[1:13:15] holy ghost like the gentiles dead
[1:13:22] praise the lord
[1:13:27] because the jews
[1:13:29] they waited for a sign
[1:13:32] but for the gentiles
[1:13:34] i speak it preach the word
[1:13:38] praise the lord let me tell you he was
[1:13:41] not he was not
[1:13:43] your your modern day evangelist
[1:13:47] all peter was doing he was standing
[1:13:49] behind that pooping whether he was a
[1:13:51] puppet or whether he was sitting down
[1:13:54] all he was doing he was just testifying
[1:13:57] of the things that they have seen in the
[1:13:59] ministry of jesus christ he was just
[1:14:02] having a conversation with him but
[1:14:04] because the people were honored so much
[1:14:06] expectation
[1:14:09] the holy ghost came down
[1:14:12] peter said i wish we did receive it like
[1:14:14] the gentiles
[1:14:16] in acts chapter 15
[1:14:18] he uh he challenged the council
[1:14:20] he said i saw it with my eyes
[1:14:24] these people received the same holy
[1:14:26] ghost like we did
[1:14:28] but what was the early church doing
[1:14:30] they wanted them to be circumcised
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:35] they wanted them to hold some form some
[1:14:38] identity of of judaism
[1:14:44] praise the lord
[1:14:46] so you see when people get attached
[1:14:49] to documents
[1:14:51] things that they have learned all of
[1:14:52] their life
[1:14:54] in church even if they see the truth
[1:14:58] they struggle with it
[1:15:00] because this is the way that we have
[1:15:02] done it all of our life
[1:15:09] praise the lord
[1:15:10] even though
[1:15:12] they saw
[1:15:14] a man thou was lean
[1:15:17] maybe he's been sitting at the temple
[1:15:19] gate since he was a teenage boy
[1:15:22] he got to drag himself every every
[1:15:26] morning to come there and sit there and
[1:15:27] beg for arms everybody that went into
[1:15:30] the synagogues knew this man
[1:15:37] and right before the eyes they saw his
[1:15:41] his joints
[1:15:42] bones sounding and all his knees coming
[1:15:46] back and and that man when when peter
[1:15:48] and joe said savor and go we have not
[1:15:52] but what we have we give to you in the
[1:15:54] name of jesus christ rise up and walk
[1:16:00] praise the lord
[1:16:05] it says we want to ask you in whose name
[1:16:07] you did this miracle
[1:16:12] praise the lord
[1:16:14] peter and john said jesus
[1:16:21] when there is a living truth before them
[1:16:30] praise the lord
[1:16:33] you see that's that's that that's that's
[1:16:35] one thing we don't realize
[1:16:38] how attached
[1:16:40] we become
[1:16:42] to our beliefs
[1:16:45] what a family believes what a tribal
[1:16:49] beliefs
[1:16:51] what are national beliefs
[1:16:55] well our religious beliefs
[1:16:59] we don't realize
[1:17:01] how attached
[1:17:04] we become to those things
[1:17:08] even sometimes we struggle
[1:17:10] to break free
[1:17:12] even when we know
[1:17:15] they are destroying our lives
[1:17:23] our beliefs
[1:17:24] lies in your subconscious
[1:17:28] the lies in your subconscious
[1:17:33] praise the lord
[1:17:35] you see that's why when the son of man
[1:17:36] make free it's not to move you from one
[1:17:39] church building to another church
[1:17:40] building
[1:17:42] no he makes you free he goes in your
[1:17:45] spirit
[1:17:46] he goes in your subconscious
[1:17:50] to deliver you from some of those
[1:17:53] attachments
[1:17:55] because we become so attached
[1:18:00] praise the lord
[1:18:07] those things are there
[1:18:12] and that's what was happening to these
[1:18:13] people
[1:18:14] you realize there were where paul
[1:18:17] testified of how i rebuked peter
[1:18:20] because paul i mean peter was trying to
[1:18:23] to eat with the gentiles he was trying
[1:18:25] to fellowship with the gentiles
[1:18:28] amen
[1:18:29] and trying to fellowship with the
[1:18:31] gentiles he saw other jews coming what
[1:18:33] he did he
[1:18:35] he shrank
[1:18:38] why may him to do that it was something
[1:18:41] that he was attached to
[1:18:43] emotionally attached in his spirit
[1:18:53] praise the lord
[1:18:57] so we see all of these things
[1:19:00] how uh
[1:19:07] a better testament
[1:19:09] a better mediator
[1:19:11] a better promise
[1:19:14] a better coveting
[1:19:16] praise the lord
[1:19:18] amen i'm just trying to get to my
[1:19:21] scripture reading and not even started
[1:19:22] preaching here
[1:19:24] so just uh
[1:19:27] just bear with me in a little bit
[1:19:30] amen i hope you had a good breakfast
[1:19:32] this morning
[1:19:35] amen
[1:19:38] you know when you have a good breakfast
[1:19:40] before coming to church
[1:19:42] if you have too much it'll make you
[1:19:44] sleep
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:50] if you just have a little bit just to
[1:19:53] kick that blood up going man
[1:19:56] it makes you enjoy the word
[1:19:59] praise the lord
[1:20:01] chapter 9 let's look at chapter 9 verse
[1:20:03] 23
[1:20:06] the lord be merciful
[1:20:08] happy for jesus
[1:20:12] now we talk about a better covenant than
[1:20:14] a better promise chapter 9
[1:20:17] verse 23 the uh the apostle paul
[1:20:21] is also going to show
[1:20:23] so you see here he was he was trying to
[1:20:26] make them to know
[1:20:28] you know the the prophets the
[1:20:31] law gave us these things
[1:20:33] but it was just a shadow
[1:20:38] it was just a shadow
[1:20:40] the life has to travel on
[1:20:43] praise the lord
[1:20:45] amen
[1:20:46] the life has to travel on
[1:20:49] you see that that's that's what happened
[1:20:51] when you know when uh you know when when
[1:20:54] when the baby is born oh my goodness
[1:20:56] that's the cutest thing on earth oh
[1:20:58] she's so cute
[1:20:59] oh he's so cute look at his cheeks
[1:21:02] so cute
[1:21:05] praise the lord
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:08] as soon as i try to start getting off
[1:21:10] the floor and start throwing everything
[1:21:12] down from the table oh my what a trouble
[1:21:14] he is
[1:21:16] my goodness this boy
[1:21:21] praise the lord
[1:21:23] amen
[1:21:25] he's so cute while you're full of
[1:21:26] trouble
[1:21:30] god be to god
[1:21:31] and then when the child grow up
[1:21:34] when they get into their teenage
[1:21:37] years
[1:21:38] this test to
[1:21:40] find an identity
[1:21:43] they try to find a personal identity
[1:21:45] they try to struggle to detach
[1:21:47] themselves away from what daddy said or
[1:21:50] mommy said i mean
[1:21:52] sometimes not in the bad way sometimes
[1:21:54] it's in a bad way
[1:21:55] and uh
[1:21:56] but
[1:21:57] as as they start doing that
[1:21:59] uh uh
[1:22:01] then there is another thing also that is
[1:22:03] happening to the parent they start
[1:22:04] getting afraid oh my god
[1:22:08] he have never gone to the mall by
[1:22:09] himself oh my god
[1:22:11] where is he he have not called me yeah
[1:22:13] oh my god he's going out with his friend
[1:22:14] oh my god
[1:22:16] you know they start becoming afraid
[1:22:19] praise the lord
[1:22:22] but it's just a life
[1:22:24] that is traveling
[1:22:28] coming to
[1:22:29] full
[1:22:30] maturity
[1:22:33] praise the lord
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:39] and then it gets to the place where the
[1:22:41] uh the board or the girl started
[1:22:44] start having a friend that that they are
[1:22:46] interested in
[1:22:47] just like i said young people i was
[1:22:49] thinking about speaking on the subject
[1:22:51] i'm
[1:22:52] praying about it i don't know maybe i
[1:22:54] might do it next week and that would
[1:22:55] just be dedicated to my young people
[1:22:57] amen
[1:22:58] so any young person from 100 years old
[1:23:02] down you are invited
[1:23:05] it's only for the young people amen
[1:23:08] only for the young
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:12] if the lord
[1:23:13] uh want us to do that if not we'll find
[1:23:16] a better time to do it
[1:23:18] you know so that that that happens
[1:23:22] you know but we have to realize that uh
[1:23:26] you know uh uh
[1:23:29] that little baby that was secured i
[1:23:31] think and the one that was killed in
[1:23:33] photo trouble
[1:23:35] is the one that has come to this place
[1:23:37] in their life where they announced a man
[1:23:40] or noun the woman to get on a head ship
[1:23:43] in in all of that
[1:23:45] and uh
[1:23:47] you know it's it's it must bring us to
[1:23:49] the place where we can find a place of
[1:23:51] rest
[1:23:52] knowing that everything
[1:23:55] that i've you know uh uh installed into
[1:23:58] my child
[1:23:59] you know uh
[1:24:01] they are going to do do the best
[1:24:04] now and if if we become trouble
[1:24:06] that someone out there is going to
[1:24:09] influence them then it's a reflection
[1:24:11] also that we never really did some good
[1:24:13] foundational work
[1:24:15] if you have some good foundational work
[1:24:17] laid down you just have to trust the
[1:24:19] lord
[1:24:20] amen train up a child in a way that they
[1:24:23] will go
[1:24:24] and they will never depart from it amen
[1:24:28] even if they try to go away they will
[1:24:30] never leave them
[1:24:32] now so it's it's all of those things i'm
[1:24:34] just trying to bring those things out
[1:24:36] there but let's let's go ahead right
[1:24:37] here that's chapter nine
[1:24:39] and uh
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:44] praise the lord
[1:24:50] verse 23
[1:24:52] that's what we were going to look at to
[1:24:54] have nine verse 23
[1:25:00] verse 22 says and almost all things are
[1:25:03] by the law parched with blood
[1:25:07] and without the sharing
[1:25:10] of blood
[1:25:11] is no remission
[1:25:14] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:25:16] that chorus we signed this morning or
[1:25:18] just before we entered into the word it
[1:25:20] was just uh now for music
[1:25:24] but without the sharing of blood there
[1:25:26] is no remission
[1:25:28] and uh i won't do that tonight but we
[1:25:31] trust the lord to be able to find time
[1:25:32] to do that and show you what was
[1:25:35] different between the synagos and the
[1:25:38] temple
[1:25:40] praise the lord amen
[1:25:42] that's the reason why the jews do they
[1:25:45] don't have a worship
[1:25:48] they're having they having stripes and
[1:25:50] people that are reading the lord and
[1:25:52] everything they are doing they're trying
[1:25:54] to keep the lord of moses and everything
[1:25:56] that they are doing you know it's it's
[1:25:58] wonderful as as they try to keep the
[1:26:00] torah you know the dress and and and you
[1:26:03] know the weather white everything to do
[1:26:05] all of those zionists and everything but
[1:26:07] you see their worship is not accepted to
[1:26:10] god
[1:26:11] because god will not accept a worship
[1:26:14] without blood
[1:26:16] and they don't have a temple
[1:26:19] they don't have a temple to make
[1:26:20] sacrifices
[1:26:23] praise the lord
[1:26:25] amen they don't have a temple to make
[1:26:27] sacrifices
[1:26:32] do you see how god in in his design he
[1:26:36] had to do that because now this is the
[1:26:39] dispensation of the gentiles
[1:26:41] and god's attention is on the gentiles
[1:26:47] praise the lord
[1:26:53] and the day that god turned his heart
[1:26:55] eyes back on the jews they would have
[1:26:58] the rare offer they would have a temple
[1:27:00] ready for sacrifice they will have
[1:27:02] everything that they need for sacrifice
[1:27:07] and it's that day that god will accept
[1:27:09] their worship
[1:27:18] praise the lord
[1:27:20] i believe that's the reason why a lot of
[1:27:22] the a lot of uh uh the the evangelists
[1:27:25] are trying to bring
[1:27:26] bring jesus to them
[1:27:28] our sacrifice
[1:27:31] because god will not accept worship
[1:27:33] with our blood
[1:27:41] we can bring to god no bloodless worship
[1:27:47] praise the lord
[1:27:49] amen
[1:27:52] when people just want to you know uh you
[1:27:55] know just want to be fancy and just want
[1:27:57] to be needed and and all of that you
[1:27:59] know they don't want their hair dude to
[1:28:01] be messed up and they don't want uh you
[1:28:03] know uh stain on their cults and you you
[1:28:06] know and and all of that god will not
[1:28:08] accept a worship that is not bloody
[1:28:20] without the sharing of blood there's no
[1:28:22] remission
[1:28:24] it was necessary
[1:28:26] it was therefore necessary
[1:28:30] that the patents of things
[1:28:33] in the heavens
[1:28:35] the patents of things god told moses
[1:28:38] build the tabernacle according to the
[1:28:40] patent
[1:28:42] the pattern of things in the heavens
[1:28:45] it was necessary that the pattern of
[1:28:47] things in the heavens be purified
[1:28:51] with these
[1:28:54] but the heavenly things themselves
[1:28:57] with better
[1:28:59] sacrifice
[1:29:01] than these
[1:29:03] moses built the tabernacle according to
[1:29:06] the pattern that god revealed to him
[1:29:08] genesis i mean exodus chapter 25
[1:29:12] but yet
[1:29:14] he had to spring a blood on every
[1:29:16] instrument in a tabernacle
[1:29:19] praise the lord
[1:29:21] now so paul is saying here that even
[1:29:24] though those everything was built
[1:29:26] according to the patent but they needed
[1:29:29] to be purified with blood and even
[1:29:31] though moses purified them with blood
[1:29:34] when jesus died he had to go to the
[1:29:37] heavens
[1:29:40] he had to present himself in heaven
[1:29:44] that's why when mary saw him rabona he
[1:29:46] said touch me now woman
[1:29:48] i've never sent it to my father
[1:29:50] yet he had to take that sacrifice told
[1:29:54] the heavens
[1:29:55] that things in heaven and things on the
[1:29:58] earth will be sanctified by the sheer
[1:30:01] blood
[1:30:02] of jesus christ
[1:30:07] we have a better sacrifice
[1:30:10] praise the lord
[1:30:12] amen
[1:30:17] glory be to god
[1:30:20] amen amen
[1:30:24] hallelujah
[1:30:26] but the things in heaven themselves with
[1:30:28] a better sacrifice than this
[1:30:30] chapter 10 verse 34
[1:30:32] hello i'm just reading bible today
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:44] all of all paul was doing he was just
[1:30:46] exalting jesus
[1:30:49] he was just exalting jesus
[1:30:54] because he know he said if i be lifted
[1:30:56] up
[1:30:57] i will draw all men
[1:31:01] chapter 10 verse 34.
[1:31:12] he says for ye had compassion of me in
[1:31:15] my bounds and
[1:31:18] took joyfulness with
[1:31:20] joyful and and talked joyfully the
[1:31:23] spoils
[1:31:24] of your goals lauren in yourself that ye
[1:31:28] have in heaven a better
[1:31:33] and
[1:31:34] an enduring substance
[1:31:37] praise the lord
[1:31:38] it's talking to the to the to the
[1:31:40] persecuted hebrew church going through
[1:31:43] uh trials going through persecution
[1:31:46] there you know that
[1:31:48] you are losing effortless substance
[1:31:50] because of this gospel in heaven there
[1:31:52] are better better substances amen
[1:31:54] internal substance praise the lord
[1:31:57] chapter 11 verse 16.
[1:32:00] are we ever going to preach this morning
[1:32:04] amen
[1:32:06] but you see i've always believed that if
[1:32:08] you don't get yourself familiar with

[1:39:23] let's go to the book of uh pd let's go
[1:39:26] to peter
[1:39:30] i think
[1:39:35] praise the lord
[1:39:40] let's go to the apostle peter
[1:39:43] amen
[1:39:51] i mean it's so it's so amazing
[1:39:54] real is so amazing when you when you
[1:39:56] just look
[1:39:58] there and
[1:39:59] and appreciate
[1:40:00] the way the
[1:40:02] the word of god is so
[1:40:03] it's so wonderful amen
[1:40:07] what a blessing what a treasure
[1:40:09] that we have
[1:40:11] praise the lord
[1:40:14] if uh
[1:40:15] if the lord can only
[1:40:17] allow us to
[1:40:20] you know grow in the grace of that and
[1:40:22] and just and just appreciate everything
[1:40:25] that uh
[1:40:26] his love is doing
[1:40:29] in our lives
[1:40:33] hallelujah
[1:40:35] now in the uh second peter chapter one
[1:40:39] second peter chapter one
[1:40:41] now we will see that this is where
[1:40:44] paul talks about uh
[1:40:47] uh
[1:40:48] i mean peter talks about
[1:40:51] what
[1:40:54] we call the statue of a perfect man
[1:40:57] amen
[1:41:00] the stature of a perfect man
[1:41:03] now you you know the reading there so
[1:41:06] i'm just going to
[1:41:08] uh
[1:41:11] i'm just going to drop down a little bit
[1:41:20] now now peter peter says here verse two
[1:41:24] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:41:25] through the knowledge of god and
[1:41:27] and of of jesus our lord i call him as
[1:41:31] his divine power
[1:41:33] have given us all things all of these
[1:41:36] things that we have talked about better
[1:41:37] salvation better coveting you know
[1:41:39] better you know blessings and all of
[1:41:41] that
[1:41:43] that pertain onto life and godliness
[1:41:45] through the knowledge of him that have
[1:41:47] caught us
[1:41:49] to glory
[1:41:51] and virtue wherefore by giving unto us
[1:41:54] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:41:57] that by this year might be partakers of
[1:42:01] the divine nature
[1:42:04] having escaped
[1:42:06] the corruption that is in the word
[1:42:08] through lust
[1:42:10] now so we realize that this divine
[1:42:13] nature that god
[1:42:15] that peter is talking about here that
[1:42:18] god wants us to be partakers of those
[1:42:20] divine nature are his attributes
[1:42:25] those attributes of being a healer of
[1:42:27] being a savior a provider you know uh
[1:42:31] being a companion a comforter all of
[1:42:33] those attributes of god
[1:42:35] that's what uh he's referring to
[1:42:39] it's strange to know
[1:42:41] let's let's read them and then he and
[1:42:43] then he talks about all of this
[1:42:46] uh uh
[1:42:48] you know add to your you know faith
[1:42:51] that's you and and knowledge and all of
[1:42:53] that he comes to uh
[1:42:55] charity
[1:42:57] he says and if these things be in you
[1:43:00] and abound verse 8 they make you that
[1:43:02] year yeah and neither
[1:43:05] uh shall never be boring not unfruitful
[1:43:08] in the knowledge of our lord jesus
[1:43:11] verse verse nine
[1:43:13] and uh
[1:43:14] but he that likes these things is blind
[1:43:18] which means he's he's deformed amen when
[1:43:21] you like these things that you you
[1:43:23] become stagnant in your growth
[1:43:26] and and cannot see a fire off
[1:43:30] and have forgotten that he was part from
[1:43:33] his own sin now this is what i want to
[1:43:35] grab you on this
[1:43:37] wherefore the rather brethren's give
[1:43:39] diligence to make your call and your
[1:43:42] election show
[1:43:43] for if you do this
[1:43:46] you shall never fall
[1:43:48] now there is a word that is used here
[1:43:51] that that is that is very tricky
[1:43:54] amen
[1:43:55] it comes very tricky
[1:44:00] uh
[1:44:02] let's see how how the how the amplifier
[1:44:04] brings it out because of these bridges
[1:44:07] be all the more
[1:44:10] uh eager to make sure
[1:44:14] uh
[1:44:15] to be strengthened to to make
[1:44:19] you're calling
[1:44:21] an election now that's that's the word
[1:44:24] there to make sure
[1:44:26] now in in the in the in the in the king
[1:44:29] james it say make your calling so it
[1:44:32] almost looks like something you can do
[1:44:35] something you should do
[1:44:37] no
[1:44:38] it's it's it's uh it's i was standing on
[1:44:41] standing there last night and and it
[1:44:43] kind of blessed me in a way
[1:44:45] you think about little samuel
[1:44:47] when samuel was asleep and the law was
[1:44:50] calling him
[1:44:51] he woke up and he went to elan
[1:44:54] he wanted to do what make sure
[1:44:57] who was calling him
[1:45:00] amen he was not going to make eli to
[1:45:03] call him
[1:45:05] he was trying to make sure who was
[1:45:08] calling him
[1:45:10] so the apostle
[1:45:12] peter is saying that you have to make
[1:45:14] sure who call you
[1:45:17] did you hear the voice of a church
[1:45:20] oh you heard the voice of the shepherd
[1:45:24] because he says my sheep knows my voice
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:29] praise the lord
[1:45:30] man if you know that he call you
[1:45:34] no church can kick you out
[1:45:37] amen
[1:45:39] if a man calls you a man will discourage
[1:45:42] you
[1:45:43] amen
[1:45:44] but if he calls you
[1:45:48] so peter is saying make sure
[1:45:51] we'll call you
[1:45:54] make sure who casted their vote for you
[1:45:59] that's what we do in election
[1:46:01] brother adam says he casted his vote for
[1:46:04] me that they ever casted his vote
[1:46:06] against me
[1:46:09] when jesus casted his vote he casted his
[1:46:11] vote for you
[1:46:14] as his bride as his elite
[1:46:16] as a people in laodicean age
[1:46:20] so peter is saying make sure who call
[1:46:23] you
[1:46:24] who voice that you heard
[1:46:27] who are you following
[1:46:31] praise the lord
[1:46:33] amen now the reason is because he talks
[1:46:36] about this divine nature which of course
[1:46:39] i said the divine nature are god's
[1:46:41] attributes
[1:46:43] now so
[1:46:44] you will realize that the theory of
[1:46:47] evolution
[1:46:50] has existed and and signs the back
[1:46:53] around that theory for a long time
[1:46:56] until the dna core was broken
[1:47:01] when the dna core was broken
[1:47:04] the divine nature attributes
[1:47:09] when the dna call was broken
[1:47:15] praise the lord
[1:47:17] the starstore reversed the artery
[1:47:24] praise the lord
[1:47:25] amen because there are things that the
[1:47:28] dna called
[1:47:30] reveals
[1:47:34] praise the lord
[1:47:35] i was able to take few of these things
[1:47:37] from my friend
[1:47:38] charlie
[1:47:40] and uh
[1:47:42] i hope i can be able to
[1:47:44] to
[1:47:44] try to put it in sequence but
[1:47:46] you know
[1:47:48] sometimes i struggle to do these things
[1:47:51] praise the lord
[1:47:55] so uh uh brother brother brother jordan
[1:47:58] you will help me
[1:47:59] and if you can just
[1:48:01] if you can just switch this slide off
[1:48:07] praise the lord let's go back to the dna
[1:48:09] code of life go back to the dna code of
[1:48:11] life
[1:48:12] maybe that will help us
[1:48:13] to be able to follow it
[1:48:24] the slider has the dna code of life
[1:48:39] i don't know how he appeared but that
[1:48:41] should be the second slide
[1:48:44] if if he went in the order that uh i
[1:48:46] have it here
[1:48:54] praise the lord
[1:49:01] it shows that
[1:49:04] while they are trying to figure it out
[1:49:06] back there
[1:49:07] it shows that there are there there are
[1:49:10] three billion
[1:49:13] runs on the frame of uh
[1:49:15] of uh uh uh you know three billion of
[1:49:18] all of these uh cells and and our dna
[1:49:21] code also shows that it's digital
[1:49:28] and
[1:49:28] in your dna
[1:49:30] it has error correcting
[1:49:35] your dna has error correcting
[1:49:38] you see that's the reason why a child
[1:49:40] can be born
[1:49:43] with some form of deformity
[1:49:46] and the doctor will check in and realize
[1:49:49] and says well as a child grow up it will
[1:49:52] correct itself
[1:49:57] because it's in is in our our dna
[1:50:02] error correcting
[1:50:05] praise the lord
[1:50:08] as a child grow up they they can be they
[1:50:11] can be stubborn they can be doing all
[1:50:13] sorts of things there is there is a
[1:50:15] junction in their life they will meet
[1:50:21] and you realize that
[1:50:23] thing starts to change
[1:50:31] because that's the way we were designed
[1:50:35] you see
[1:50:36] and that that it is that is what brother
[1:50:39] brandon brought out in the statue of a
[1:50:41] perfect man
[1:50:43] and what confuses the church is the
[1:50:46] world when paul said when peter said to
[1:50:49] your faith you can add to your faith
[1:50:51] where are you going to barf at you
[1:50:54] we dress to sell patients
[1:50:59] so people think it's something that you
[1:51:01] can work out no it's already in in that
[1:51:05] divine nature
[1:51:07] that divine nature that he has made us
[1:51:10] partake us off
[1:51:12] virtue is there passion is there
[1:51:14] knowledge is there
[1:51:16] all you need is the right environment
[1:51:19] and the right food
[1:51:21] as you grow
[1:51:22] there are things that will correct
[1:51:24] himself
[1:51:28] some of those stubborn habits and things
[1:51:30] we got from grandparents and and
[1:51:35] and things that is bugging a lot as you
[1:51:37] walk in the light
[1:51:39] as he is in the light
[1:51:41] the blood cleanses us
[1:51:47] in our spiritual dna we have correcting
[1:51:50] code
[1:51:51] that's the reason why it don't take
[1:51:53] legalizing to correct the church but
[1:51:55] abraham says the word corrects the error
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:18] our dna have explode advanced language
[1:52:22] design
[1:52:24] my goodness what is that i don't know
[1:52:31] i'm not a doctor
[1:52:33] praise the lord
[1:52:34] i will borrow my nose to brother jordy
[1:52:37] he's the one that is the the man
[1:52:40] steadying blood and dna and colds and
[1:52:42] all of that
[1:52:44] so he can come and better explain it to
[1:52:46] us amen
[1:52:48] praise the lord
[1:52:49] amen so brother jordan if i'm saying
[1:52:51] something that is wrong here just meet
[1:52:53] me in the office
[1:53:01] you have an exploitative vines
[1:53:05] of language design
[1:53:08] the blood has a language
[1:53:13] it has a language
[1:53:16] that it speaks
[1:53:20] praise the lord
[1:53:23] you go somewhere then uh you know uh uh
[1:53:27] and you just walk in you you don't have
[1:53:29] your your name on on your back and
[1:53:31] nothing like that and someone sees you
[1:53:33] this is oh wow
[1:53:35] hey mr jones your father
[1:53:38] yeah the blood have just spoke
[1:53:42] a language
[1:53:47] oh yeah
[1:53:48] who are you just like your father
[1:53:54] the blood has just spoke
[1:53:57] it has an advanced
[1:53:59] language design
[1:54:03] that is more than our appearance
[1:54:08] praise the lord
[1:54:11] but this morning we're talking about a
[1:54:13] blood
[1:54:14] that speak
[1:54:16] better thanks
[1:54:20] the blood that speak
[1:54:22] better things
[1:54:24] this is just
[1:54:26] the human
[1:54:27] blood let me let me just show you some
[1:54:29] things quickly here
[1:54:31] uh i will not be able to
[1:54:33] like i said
[1:54:35] let's let's uh you take the slide i have
[1:54:37] the digital information system
[1:54:43] the in in in in our dna
[1:54:47] the dna is the master blueprint
[1:54:52] just like how god gave moses a blueprint
[1:54:55] to build a tabernacle
[1:54:58] so it can reflect
[1:55:00] the pattern that is in heaven
[1:55:02] your dna
[1:55:04] is the master blueprint
[1:55:09] praise the lord
[1:55:11] amen
[1:55:12] that's the reason why
[1:55:14] when they want to
[1:55:15] test what are the charters for you then
[1:55:17] they don't say send us your photo
[1:55:21] no they say go and do a dna test
[1:55:24] we want the master blueprint we want to
[1:55:28] mash it up
[1:55:34] so
[1:55:35] from the dna
[1:55:37] we have a transcript that is the rna
[1:55:40] which is now the photo
[1:55:44] amen
[1:55:47] then
[1:55:48] that that transcript
[1:55:50] a now goes into
[1:55:53] translation that is called protein
[1:55:58] so all of these it revolves in our body
[1:56:03] praise the lord
[1:56:05] you see
[1:56:07] we we don't know of all of these things
[1:56:09] that are happening
[1:56:11] we realize there are four vibes
[1:56:14] in our hearts
[1:56:16] where the blood pumps through they just
[1:56:18] go in cycle
[1:56:20] praise the lord
[1:56:22] amen
[1:56:25] no wonder we have full gospel
[1:56:31] that has the story of redemption
[1:56:35] praise the lord
[1:56:38] so we realize the other is from that
[1:56:40] translation
[1:56:42] you know well the dna you know produce
[1:56:45] the rna and rna they produce the protein
[1:56:48] and then it goes back again and the
[1:56:49] protein produce dna in it you know just
[1:56:52] like that in that cycle
[1:56:54] i i i want to get your attention here
[1:56:57] uh all the too much reading was was
[1:57:00] trying to put you to sleep so
[1:57:04] praise the lord
[1:57:06] let's take uh the the slide with uh uh
[1:57:10] the nicolette isaac the dna
[1:57:13] and and uh and and these four
[1:57:16] four uh uh subtypes
[1:57:20] now we we have these
[1:57:22] uh there in in our blood
[1:57:27] and and the way that they work is the
[1:57:29] other
[1:57:31] uh
[1:57:35] take the slide of the dna replication
[1:57:39] so those four four types of uh
[1:57:43] uh uh thing there in in our dna
[1:57:47] the replicates in a way were two of them
[1:57:51] two of them meets all the time so the
[1:57:53] yellow and the orange were made and the
[1:57:55] grain and the blue will meet
[1:57:59] as as the meat
[1:58:02] they produce themselves it happened so
[1:58:05] fast
[1:58:07] praise the lord
[1:58:09] it happened so fast
[1:58:11] now go let's go to the next side slot of
[1:58:13] of the dna replication they it happened
[1:58:16] so fast that they
[1:58:17] as they produce themselves their breaks
[1:58:20] up
[1:58:22] they breaks up and then they start
[1:58:23] producing themselves again
[1:58:27] praise the lord
[1:58:28] that's how the works in our body
[1:58:34] they work so fast
[1:58:35] they breaks up they produce themselves
[1:58:37] they breaks up they produce themselves
[1:58:39] the breaks up
[1:58:40] it just it just go on and on and on and
[1:58:43] on and on
[1:58:46] praise the lord
[1:58:50] sometimes we
[1:58:53] we don't have no no idea
[1:58:55] of what is taking place in this body
[1:59:01] of how this body is built is made
[1:59:05] praise the lord
[1:59:07] now so uh uh
[1:59:09] that would be all that would be all for

[1:59:15] time here so yeah that thank you for the
[1:59:17] light back on let's just move right on
[1:59:19] here now so uh uh uh the the reason i

[1:59:27] uh when we come back to what the the
[1:59:30] apostle peter was telling now you have
[1:59:32] to realize also that was peter letter
[1:59:34] back to the jewish to the to the hebrew
[1:59:36] church

[2:00:11] that's the reason why there is there is
[2:00:13] not a dull moment
[2:00:15] for a son of god or a daughter of god
[2:00:18] we leave this life and we step into
[2:00:21] another one
[2:00:23] praise the lord
[2:00:24] you might lay my body down there in the
[2:00:26] grave but i have stepped into another

[2:00:30] honor takeoff i've gotten into my new
[2:00:32] body
[2:00:38] praise the lord
[2:00:43] so peter was trying to make this
[2:00:45] emphasis to the church
[2:00:47] that you have to make sure who have

[2:02:08] to have an error correcting court
[2:02:13] praise the lord
[2:02:18] i mean it's a design

[2:36:36] see it's lying right in the prodigal son
[2:36:38] that's the reason why when the prodigal
[2:36:40] son came back
[2:36:41] the father did not
[2:36:43] yell ahead and fuss with him
[2:36:45] while the father did the father set a
[2:36:47] feast for him
[2:36:49] you know i used to tell parents you know
[2:36:51] when when the child do wrong don't don't
[2:36:54] you know don't punish them with food
[2:36:56] because if you polish them with food you
[2:36:58] are stopping their blood from working

[2:37:27] been eating in the pig pan
[2:37:30] and now he needs to eat something better
[2:37:34] praise the lord

[2:37:39] called us and get us out of our pe pen
[2:37:41] he set before us a seventh on the
[2:37:44] message the messages of god reveal
[2:37:48] and sometimes you don't even understand
[2:37:49] it but you say amen
[2:37:52] say hallelujah
[2:37:56] and i should just keep feeling on it
[2:38:00] that divine
[2:38:01] error correcting code
[2:38:03] will start correcting things in your
[2:38:05] life
[2:38:08] and you will start loving the lord
