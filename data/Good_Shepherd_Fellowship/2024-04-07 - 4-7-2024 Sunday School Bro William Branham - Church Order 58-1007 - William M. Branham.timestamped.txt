[0:45] the
[0:46] Tabernacle where by God's grace and by
[0:50] his help I have tried hard by the
[0:54] scriptures to set in order the Church of
[0:57] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00] as we believe at the brandham
[1:05] Tabernacle the first thing I wish to say
[1:09] is that the pastor is always in full
[1:14] charge of the Tabernacle in my
[1:18] absence and I only look to the pastor
[1:21] when I return so he is in full charge to
[1:26] change or to do whatsoever he thinks
[1:28] it's best under the leadership ship of
[1:30] the Holy Spirit while I am
[1:34] aw we
[1:36] believe in an Apostolic Church teaching
[1:40] Apostolic
[1:42] blessings for people of this day we
[1:46] believe in the Full
[1:48] Gospel and believe that all of the signs
[1:52] and the Wonders that was spoken of by
[1:56] our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany
[1:58] his church until he returned
[2:00] we believe in those
[2:02] things and believe that they are to be
[2:04] set in
[2:05] order that the church has its
[2:09] order and each church has its Doctrine
[2:13] and Order and discipline our church has
[2:16] no members as
[2:19] joiners we believe that the whole
[2:21] Universal Church of the Living God is
[2:24] our brothers and
[2:25] sisters and all people are always
[2:28] welcome regardless of what denomination
[2:31] they belong to at the ram Tabernacle at
[2:34] 8th and 10th Street in Jeffersonville
[2:37] Indiana we believe in justification by
[2:41] faith
[2:42] Romans
[2:45] 51 we believe that after a person being
[2:48] justified by faith he has peace with the
[2:51] Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that
[2:55] this same person could have habits such
[2:59] as drink drinking smoking doing things
[3:02] that he should not do filthy habits of
[3:04] the flesh then we believe that the blood
[3:07] of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person
[3:10] for the service of the Lord and that's
[3:13] we believe in sanctification according
[3:15] to Hebrews
[3:17] 13 12 and 13 for
[3:21] Jesus also that he might sanctify the
[3:24] people with his own blood suffered
[3:26] without the gates and we believe that
[3:28] sanctification is taught in the New
[3:31] Testament and meant for the Believers
[3:34] through the New Testament age which
[3:37] we're now
[3:39] living and we also believe that after
[3:42] the person has been Sanctified the
[3:46] unclean habits is gone from the person
[3:48] he's a Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:50] and his habits are gone we believe that
[3:53] then he is a candidate for the baptism
[3:55] of the Holy Spirit which comes as a
[3:58] filling of the
[4:01] believer and then when the believer it's
[4:04] just as many times as I have taught it
[4:06] like picking up a glass out in the
[4:08] chicken yard justification is picking it
[4:11] up ready for to use it with a purpose in
[4:14] heart that's what God does to a sinner
[4:16] he's still filthy then he's cleansed by
[4:19] the blood of Jesus Christ and the word
[4:22] sanctify is a compound word which means
[4:25] cleaned and set aside for
[4:28] service and the the Old Testament the
[4:30] altar Sanctified The Vessel and it was
[4:33] set aside for service we believe that
[4:36] the holy spirit is put in the same
[4:38] vessel in service that the holy spirit
[4:41] is uh not another step of Grace but more
[4:45] of the same Grace that fills the
[4:48] believer to the extent where that signs
[4:51] and wonders such as the apostolic gifts
[4:55] spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12 manifest
[4:58] themselves through this believer when
[5:00] the Holy Spirit comes in to take up the
[5:02] gift I believe at the scripture teaches
[5:06] that gifts and callings are without
[5:08] repentance that when we're born in this
[5:10] world we are sent here by one purpose
[5:13] that is of god and that before we even
[5:18] become adults while we're yet children
[5:20] the gifts that we have of God is in a
[5:22] stand and only the filling of the Holy
[5:26] Spirit puts these gifts into operation
[5:28] but we have them in to the ending such
[5:30] as teachers and apostles and and
[5:33] Prophets and Gifts of tongues and the
[5:36] nine spiritual gifts according to 1
[5:38] Corinthians 12 now we believe that these
[5:42] gifts are in operation today and they
[5:44] should be in ever local church although
[5:46] in such we have found throughout the
[5:49] world that there's much fanaticism
[5:53] hooked along with people who profess to
[5:55] be uh Apostolic Believers just as they
[5:58] are other ERS and so forth we have
[6:01] Fanatics that's been all along we've had
[6:04] those Through the Ages they had it in
[6:06] the apostolic day and as Paul said there
[6:09] that how that some had come and persuade
[6:12] them away after other doctrines and so
[6:14] forth but in his own teaching he said if
[6:17] an angel from heaven would teach
[6:18] anything else and what he had taught let
[6:21] him be a curse so we as the brandom
[6:24] Tabernacle at 8th and 10th Street year
[6:26] tried to follow the teachings of the New
[6:28] Testament or we believe that Jesus
[6:31] Christ being the Son of God and Paul the
[6:34] Apostle was a called and chosen vessel
[6:37] by election of God to be sent to the
[6:40] Gentile Church to set it in
[6:43] order now we believe and water baptism
[6:46] in the Bram Tabernacle by IMM mercing in
[6:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which
[6:51] is the apostolic uh teaching of the
[6:55] Bible and may all members of the uh
[6:59] comers to the Bram Tabernacle who desire
[7:01] such May at any time requesting to be
[7:04] immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus
[7:07] May consult the pastor if they have
[7:09] repented and believed on the Lord Jesus
[7:11] Christ the pastor will as soon as
[7:14] possible even then if he can baptize
[7:17] them immediately this does bring them
[7:19] into the Fellowship of the Believers we
[7:22] believe that by water baptism we are
[7:24] brought into a fellowship but by the
[7:26] baptism of the Holy Spirit we're brought
[7:28] into the members being members of the
[7:31] body of Jesus Christ which is all over
[7:34] the
[7:35] world
[7:36] now another thing that we believe that
[7:39] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[7:41] to every man to profit with all now we
[7:45] believe that when these gifts and so
[7:48] forth are operating in the church which
[7:50] we covet and desire that the people who
[7:54] are gifted by the Spirit come and
[7:56] worship with us now in most places we
[7:59] find that when these gifts in the people
[8:02] the people does not understand how and
[8:05] when to use these gifts and in doing so
[8:09] they only bring a reproach which we
[8:11] believe would be just what Satan could
[8:13] do to make The Outsiders the unbelievers
[8:17] and so forth afraid of this wonderful
[8:19] blessing that God has given to the
[8:21] church in these
[8:23] days Paul said when there come a
[8:26] stranger Among Us and we've all speak
[8:29] with tongue won't the man go away and
[8:32] say we were mad but if one would
[8:34] prophesy and make knowing the secret of
[8:36] the heart then they would fall down and
[8:38] say truly God is with you now we believe
[8:41] that the spiritual gift among the
[8:44] Believers is the order of the day we
[8:49] cannot believe that a man can preach
[8:51] under
[8:52] inspiration and then or be an inspired
[8:56] teacher and then Deni the gift of
[8:58] healing or the gift of Prophecy or
[9:01] speaking with tongues or interpretation
[9:03] of tongues or any of these other gifts
[9:05] so therefore here is
[9:08] my belief in God's word the way the
[9:13] brandom Tabernacle at e and Pin Street
[9:15] here in Garrisonville should be
[9:19] operated I think the first thing and
[9:22] believe that these things which I say is
[9:25] essential and must be carried out in
[9:28] this manner in the Bram Tabernacle for
[9:30] it to prosper in the
[9:32] Lord and if at any time these this would
[9:35] be questioned the person who is in
[9:38] question about it may consult me if they
[9:41] cannot get to the pastor or they could
[9:44] consult the pastor if I'm home off for
[9:47] some of the trips I'll be glad to to
[9:50] help either the Ley or the pastor at any
[9:53] time and these things are scripturally
[9:56] and I believe it's the order of the
[9:58] church I I think first that every member
[10:01] or every worshipper of the brandom
[10:04] Tabernacle should be so much in Divine
[10:08] love with each other until it would
[10:12] their hearts would long for each other
[10:15] when they have to go away to lead each
[10:16] other at the service at night I am a
[10:19] True Believer in Divine love the Apostle
[10:23] Paul said that was evidence of the Holy
[10:26] Spirit by this man all man will know
[10:28] your my disciples said
[10:31] Jesus when you have love one for the
[10:34] other and we believe that it's the love
[10:37] of God that sent Jesus Christ to the
[10:39] Earth to die for us all God so loved the
[10:43] world he gave his only begotten son that
[10:44] whosoever believeth in him should not
[10:48] perish but would have everlasting
[10:51] life and the everlasting life here is
[10:55] God's own life because we become Sons
[10:57] and Daughters of God
[10:59] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit which
[11:02] is the Seed of Abraham and gives us the
[11:05] faith that Abraham had when he believed
[11:08] God before he was even
[11:10] circumcised now the next thing we
[11:14] believe that these
[11:16] worshippers should meet together these
[11:19] gifted people such as tongues and the
[11:22] people who gets Revelations and
[11:24] interpretations and so forth these
[11:26] members or these Believers rather
[11:30] should come together at least 45 minutes
[11:34] or an hour before the services ever
[11:36] began the church should be open early
[11:40] and the Believers come together on these
[11:42] nights and at least 45 minutes to an
[11:46] hour before the services began I believe
[11:49] that brandham Tabernacle at all times
[11:51] should have a spirit filled
[11:54] pianist who would come early filled with
[11:57] the Holy Spirit and and would play
[12:02] softly very
[12:04] softly Spiritual music such as down at
[12:08] the cross where the Savior died down
[12:10] there for cleansing from sin I cried
[12:13] there to my heart was the blood applied
[12:16] glory to his name something on that
[12:18] order near my God to thee Rock of Ages
[12:21] cleff or mean or near The Cross or
[12:24] something on that order softly slowly as
[12:29] he is meditating constantly on the Holy
[12:32] Spirit he or she whichever it may
[12:35] be then I believe that the worshippers
[12:38] coming in should be met and their hang
[12:42] their coats and hats show to their seats
[12:45] with
[12:46] hospitality that only ushers or deacons
[12:50] filled with the Holy Spirit can do and
[12:53] in love to see the Church of the Living
[12:55] God go
[12:56] on these worshippers should not talk one
[12:59] with another and be talking across and
[13:03] making noise in the church they should
[13:05] come together first slip up in silent
[13:08] prayer perhaps at the altar for a few
[13:11] moments no loud praying interrupt
[13:14] someone else silent prayer you're in
[13:19] worship let that soak in worship Him in
[13:24] your
[13:25] spirit then return to your seat or you
[13:29] do not have to go to the altar just go
[13:32] in and get your seat sit down Listen To
[13:35] The Music close your eyes bow your head
[13:40] and be in silent worshiping God all
[13:45] along then if the spirit should reveal
[13:48] something to
[13:51] another or or someone be filled with the
[13:55] spirit to a place where they would speak
[13:57] with tongues then this person should
[14:00] rise and give the
[14:02] message and everyone must hold their
[14:04] peace until the interpretation comes
[14:08] when the interpretation comes it must
[14:11] not be just quoting of scripture or
[14:14] something has no meaning it must be a
[14:17] message directed to the church or we
[14:20] think that it would be in the
[14:22] flesh we see so much of that and now I
[14:26] believe the the spirit was to speak only
[14:28] for the edifying of the
[14:31] church and now it would be a message
[14:34] something on this order Perhaps Perhaps
[14:36] the people are gathering by this time
[14:38] some sick people has come in perhaps
[14:40] there's a man laying paralyzed or
[14:42] something you've never seen him before
[14:45] but when the interpretation would come
[14:47] it would be something in this order when
[14:48] the interpretation of the one who had
[14:50] just spoke would say uh well thus saith
[14:53] the Lord the man who is in our midst has
[14:56] come from a certain certain place and
[14:58] describ the place
[14:59] and would say that he is paralyzed
[15:02] because three or 4 years ago or whatever
[15:04] it may the case may be he did something
[15:07] evil like left his wife and children and
[15:09] run off from him and he's fell from a
[15:11] trussle or something like that order and
[15:13] got hurt and paralyzing thus sayith the
[15:16] Lord if he will repent of that and will
[15:18] promise to go to his wife and reconcile
[15:21] himself to her then he shall be healed
[15:24] now and return to his family and then
[15:27] before anyone says anything there must
[15:30] be at least two or more men or peoples
[15:35] in the building who are spiritually
[15:39] solid and gospel Doctrine who has a good
[15:42] discernment of spirit shall rise up and
[15:45] say that it is of the
[15:47] Lord and if this thing doesn't take
[15:49] place then tongue should not be
[15:52] mentioned in the church if the person
[15:54] speaks with tongues Paul said there be
[15:56] no interpreter and so forth let's stand
[15:59] speak at home or wherever they may be or
[16:02] they're only blessing themselves and
[16:04] it's not for edification of the church
[16:06] and this person after speaking in the
[16:09] interpretation and then two or three
[16:12] judges according to St Paul's doctrine
[16:14] of the Bible that it must be judged by
[16:16] two or three judges then let the person
[16:20] and whom it calls upon to go and maybe
[16:23] it might designate a certain person or a
[16:25] pastor or someone to go lay hands on
[16:27] this person and it it's sick or
[16:30] Afflicted and they will be healed then
[16:32] let the pastor or the other person
[16:35] whoever it may be that was designated by
[16:38] the Holy Spirit to go pray the prayer of
[16:40] faith let them go and minister to the
[16:43] person according to what the spirit has
[16:46] said then at that time the person and
[16:50] whatever the Holy Spirit has said it
[16:52] shall take place immediately then just
[16:54] as the Holy Spirit has given then the
[16:57] people could rej and be thankful and
[17:00] praise and worship God because God wants
[17:02] to be worshiped then they must then they
[17:05] must bow their heads and be in prayer
[17:07] again to see if there be another message
[17:08] that the holy spirit will want these
[17:10] gifts to manifest before and then if any
[17:13] time that a person would speak in
[17:15] tongues and interpret and the the judges
[17:18] would send the person to take to do
[17:20] whatever it was said to be done and it
[17:22] doesn't come to pass then the whole
[17:25] group of them shall go to the Altar and
[17:28] there pray God to take that spirit away
[17:30] from him because there's no one would
[17:32] want a spirit like that we would know it
[17:34] would be false and would be of the enemy
[17:37] and not of God because God can only tell
[17:41] truth let that be clearly understood by
[17:45] the church before you start this this
[17:47] new
[17:48] order then perhaps maybe it would be
[17:51] something like this the message would
[17:53] say to a certain brother maybe say would
[17:55] live by a railroad track or something to
[17:57] have him to move out because there's
[17:59] going to be a wreck on the road or
[18:01] something or anything in that order and
[18:04] let the judges after they give the
[18:05] church permission to speak uh to
[18:08] exercise this uh message that just went
[18:11] forth if their judgment is it's of God
[18:13] then watch and see if it comes to pass
[18:16] and if it comes to pass thank God and be
[18:19] very graceful graceful in your hearts
[18:21] toward him and give him praise and
[18:24] worship and be humble Above All Things
[18:29] be humble don't never get yourself
[18:33] puffed up to a place where you know more
[18:36] about it in your pastor or the church
[18:38] that you're worshiping in if you get to
[18:40] that place then I'd advise each one of
[18:43] you to get another place to worship with
[18:45] because I am asking the pastor never to
[18:48] permit anything outside of the Bible
[18:51] order a way we have seen it here in the
[18:54] church and then we want these gifts to
[18:56] be operated and in place and the
[18:58] worshippers if it's carried on correctly
[19:00] according to the word you'll see a
[19:02] mighty wonderful Church in operation for
[19:05] our Lord Jesus Christ now then the next
[19:09] thing shall take place will be that if
[19:13] these people who have that gets out of
[19:16] order uh during these times that a
[19:19] deacon or some uh Usher that's filled
[19:23] with the Holy Ghost and got lots of
[19:24] Grace in their heart shall go to the
[19:26] person reverently fatherly light and
[19:30] shall correct them in this manner or the
[19:32] pastor whoever it may be which would be
[19:34] more essential for the deacons to do so
[19:37] for the pastor at this time while these
[19:40] spiritual services are going on should
[19:42] be in the prayer room or somewhere a
[19:44] Praying these messages then if there's
[19:47] no messages going on no Revelations then
[19:50] the people would be privileged if they
[19:52] desired to raise and give a testimony a
[19:55] testimony only for the glory of God
[19:59] they're not bound to do this but
[20:00] testimonies should be given before the
[20:03] message or any song service starts or
[20:05] anything testimonies in these worship
[20:07] services do you understand church that
[20:10] in doing this you have the whole church
[20:13] in the spirit of worship before the word
[20:18] comes in to be taught then the Holy
[20:20] Spirit gets in the word and manifest God
[20:23] through the word to be a confirmation of
[20:26] your worship now
[20:29] then after this uh time for the pastor
[20:32] to come on if messages are going on say
[20:35] the pastor should come out at zachar say
[20:38] 7:30 and or quarter of 8 and if these
[20:41] messages are still going on before the
[20:43] pastor comes to his out of his study or
[20:46] wherever he may to take his place at the
[20:48] platform some brothers should instruct
[20:50] him because the Saints know that when
[20:53] the pastor comes on the platform it's
[20:55] his time then for the service and that
[20:58] gives plenty ample time for all the
[21:01] manifestations of the gift to bring the
[21:03] spirit of God into the the congregation
[21:07] and if any unbeliever would happen to be
[21:09] there be disorderly a kind-hearted
[21:11] person would go to them such as an usher
[21:14] or a deacon and would tell them that
[21:17] they would they would ask to be kept
[21:19] reverent or be reverent while the
[21:21] service are is an order because the
[21:24] spirit is in the building and the gifts
[21:26] of God are being made man manest for the
[21:30] edifying of the church and this person
[21:33] must be told in love and not harshly
[21:36] unless it would come to a place where
[21:38] they were drinking or some disobedient
[21:40] or something other that would be
[21:42] interfering with the worship of of the
[21:44] Lord uh which the gifts are then uh
[21:46] being manifest then the person should
[21:50] will should be led out to one side to
[21:52] one of the back rooms or somewhere and
[21:55] be talked to and dealt with kindly
[22:00] now while the pastor comes to the
[22:03] platform as the pastor comes to the
[22:05] platform I would suggest as the brandom
[22:08] Tabernacle here that the pastor lead the
[22:13] congregation and at least one or two
[22:17] good
[22:19] songs for we have found it so that when
[22:22] too many are trying to operate in the
[22:25] church it brings on only trouble I would
[22:29] suggest as I did while I was pastoring
[22:31] at the church I led the songs myself and
[22:36] I feel that it would be a good thing as
[22:38] the pastor did so
[22:43] [Music]
[22:57] him
[23:00] [Music]
