[singing] And he said, [music] "Follow [singing] me like I follow Christ." There's a [singing] light to the Gentiles [music] like Paul [singing] had in his day.

Father, once again, [music] Lord God, we come this evening, Lord. Father God, standing standing in the gap, Lord. Standing as a people, Father, Lord God, who hearts are a flame, standing as a people that have been touched, Lord.

Oh, if that [music] spirit dw in [singing] you ever quaking [music] your mortal body [singing] spirit. [music] [singing] Come on. [music] How many [music] is ready for just a little bit more quickening tonight? [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, before we bow our heads and pray again, I just want to share a little bit of about what's been going on in my life over the past two or three days. Number one, the quote and the [music] tape that you was playing before service. We just shared at home amongst the church in text going one to another three days ago. My pastor just [music] sent me a text and I sent him back a message that one of the scriptures that I'm going to start out with was what he had just sent to [music] me. And what it was is you keep that light going in the church because that's the lifeline of the church [music] is what the prophet of God said. And then what brother Juan just closed the the pre-ervice with, I've got written down here that I want to refer to that scripture. If the same spirit that raised [music] Christ from the dead, &gt;&gt; dwells in us, &gt;&gt; it'll quicken our mortal bodies &gt;&gt; the same way that it did him. Because the characteristics [music] of the spirit is the same [singing] no matter where it's at. If it was in the Lord Jesus, then &gt;&gt; you remember the prophet of God said that if the if the the spirit of John Dillinger was on you, it caused you to to shoot guns and rob banks. But if the spirit of Jesus Christ be in us, it'll cause us to do the same thing that it did when he was walking. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads if you would. &gt;&gt; Father, how grateful that we are [music] for your love and mercy to us, Lord. and and just seeing you [music] work in such a way Lord that when my computer didn't even want to print out what would I'll be reading [music] from here Lord but just seeing you come on the scene &gt;&gt; so that it would [music] &gt;&gt; when I was asked the question maybe the Lord doesn't want you to do that but I answered back no I believe it's the enemy trying to hinder Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, then we see you work all these things out. How marvelous you are now, Lord. &gt;&gt; You see what we have needs of being worked out in our [music] spirit, Lord, or in our bodies. We're trusting you tonight, Lord, &gt;&gt; knowing this that you said everything [music] would work out to our good when we are called by you according to your purpose, Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; And we know that we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. [singing] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name now. [music] Father, we commit the reading of the word, the service [music] into your hands for your glory and God bless you. If you want to turn in the scriptures with me in St. John 6 and and I I'll just read two or three scriptures here and and then let you be seated. But we're starting here in St. John chapter 6 and verse 32. Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven." And if you notice our brother leading song, he ended with a song. Oh, where could I go? that align in that soul said, "But when my soul needs mana from above," &gt;&gt; I I'm sorry, church. I'm just a little bit overjoyed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then in John chapter 15 and verse one, St. John 15 and1 I am the true vine. Now notice that first scripture said but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven. And now here the Lord says I am the true vine. Then in Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 24 Hebrews 9 and 24 for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God &gt;&gt; for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then in first John chapter 2 and verse 8. First John 2 and 8. Because the darkness is passed and the true light now shine. Let's just bow our heads again. Father, we thank you Lord for your word because we know that your words are life. &gt;&gt; And asking now, Lord, may you quicken these scriptures to us that they might become alive to us, Father. Let it be, oh God, as we commit these things to you now in the name of Jesus. God bless you. You could be seated. in seeing all these places here where the the Lord said that that he was the the true bread and that uh that in speaking of of Christ not entered into holy places made by hands, but but he said it was a figure of the truth. And then also the the true light. And I I I just like going back and seeing how that sometimes in our English translations uh that it it changes a little bit of the meaning. But I like to go back and see how it was intended in the original. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and in in seeing here the the strongs in looking at this word in in the Greek of how that it was uh written and I'm not a scholar in the Greek, but a lot of times I'll go back and look at that Greek dialogue that brother Brandham used because he uses it and it said it here in Strongs that that which has not only the name and a resemblance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me stop right here for a second. &gt;&gt; We could have a name on something and it would look like something. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hey, you take the here tonight. If maybe if I had a a a a Chevrolet Corvette and I told you, I want to sell you this Corvette for a very good price. And you would look at it and you you'd say, "Oh, yes. This is I I know what they look like. This is a Corvette." And I I tell you what, sit down in the seat and it's got Corvette seats in it. &gt;&gt; But when you start it up and take off, it won't hardly move. &gt;&gt; And you stop and you look under the hood and it's got a lawnmower engine in it. &gt;&gt; You'd be real disappointed with me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you'd say, "Brother Farmer, this is not a Corvette. It's a lawn mower. &gt;&gt; It looks like it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But it's powered with a lawnmower engine. When I start it up, it sounds like the kid next door mowing his yard &gt;&gt; because it has a resemblance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it has a name. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But it's not Virginia. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's not only the name and resemblance, but the real nature &gt;&gt; that's corresponding to the name. &gt;&gt; If it had the name of Corvette, it's got the na a racing name behind it and you expect it to drive like a racing car. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Not like a lawnmower. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in every respect, &gt;&gt; it corresponds to the idea signified by the name &gt;&gt; real, true, and genuine. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Philadelphiaian church age, we find the prophet of God looking at this same word, the the true vine. Since this word indeed expresses perfect realization and I'd like to say we've gone beyond perfect realization. That's right. &gt;&gt; But gone into perfect revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's this word true is separating from a partial revelation or a partial realization and shows there's a difference because the true is a perfect &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Realization and a perfect &gt;&gt; revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As illustrated in these verses, we can now understand as never before the anti-ype contrasted with the type and substance. How many believes the Lord Jesus is substance tonight? &gt;&gt; The word of God is substance compared to a shadow &gt;&gt; of substance. Take for example now the mana from heaven. God sent down angel bread from heaven for Israel. But that bread did not satisfy. It was only good for a day. They went out six days a week to pick up mana. on on the uh the sixth day, they would get enough for the two days, but they couldn't keep it any longer than two days. If they tried to get enough for all week, it wound up having maggots in it, which was not only a type of that mana, but it was also a type of the church ages of how that you couldn't take what was picked up for the Ephesian age and try to carry it on over into the next age. Neither can we take what was there for the Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we have gone beyond that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We couldn't take what was for the Lutheran age &gt;&gt; and try to exist on that manner. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because we see that that has has over the time man. It's not been bugs in it, but it's been man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That has corrupted it because they added their creeds to this or to that or to something else or they tried to denominate to where that everybody had to say it just like I said or they had to look at it just like I look at it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. We do that in divide up fellowship that we can't even rejoice and praise God with one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God sent down angel bread from heaven for Israel. But that bread did not satisfy. It was only good for a day. Those who ate it were hungry again the next day. If it was left around, it become contaminated. &gt;&gt; But Jesus is the true bread from heaven. &gt;&gt; Whereof mana was just a type. &gt;&gt; And if any man eats of that bread that came down from heaven, he'll never hunger again. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need to come back. We don't have to come back and and repent all over again. We don't have to lay down a foundation again. It's already been laid. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The moment he parttook, &gt;&gt; the moment he parttook, &gt;&gt; he had eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He recognized it. &gt;&gt; Now, we always did have eternal life. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you are a son or a daughter of God, now you always was a son and a daughter of God. We have the same testimony that God asked Job to respond to. Where were you? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; When I laid the when the sons of God shouted for joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I've I've witnessed about me first meeting brother Juan to to many people. He had uh had told me what gate that he would be in when I had flown up here. &gt;&gt; And he was going to pick me up and and I'd never seen brother Juan before. I'd never seen a picture of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was just somebody I'd talked to on the phone. And I came out the gate and when I looked up and down that line, there was 75 or 100 cars &gt;&gt; waiting on people. &gt;&gt; And somebody's here to pick me up that's never seen me and I've never seen him. And I just came out the door and started walking up this way. Got up about three cars and something says turn and go back. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I turned around and I went back and I believe it was a second car &gt;&gt; from where I had started. &gt;&gt; I looked over in the car. There was a black brother that was sitting in there. I just walked up to the car, opened the door, and said, "Brother Juan, &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother." [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; And we knew each other instantly. But I knew that IT WAS BECAUSE THAT SOMEWHERE back there, I don't remember when it was, but we had fellowship together. &gt;&gt; Awesome. &gt;&gt; To get around people and just talk to them for a few minutes. Here a year ago, we were down at Springfield, Illinois. A brother and sister had invited me into their home. We we was trying to help out a a family down there that uh the mother was was going through a a time of crisis and I just had it on my heart to go up and and and to have a house meeting with them. She couldn't get to church, but we took church to her. [applause] &gt;&gt; And brother West and his wife just so graciously asked me to come in. And she was apologizing today for not taking care of me. The perfect host and hostess. &gt;&gt; God bless you, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture says it. the way you treat one another, the way you treated me. I know how you love God. &gt;&gt; That's awesome. &gt;&gt; But it's because that we go back. &gt;&gt; I've lost my place here. &gt;&gt; It's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. He does not need to come back and eat again. The moment he parttook, he had eternal life. Here indeed was reality. &gt;&gt; No need any longer for a shadow. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; If you don't know what my hand looks like, &gt;&gt; you could look at the shadow &gt;&gt; of my hand. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But when the hand appears, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; you no longer need to rely on the shadow. &gt;&gt; Because &gt;&gt; the shadow is only the type, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; But the hand is the substance &gt;&gt; that's there that the shadow is only making an image because of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No need. Now remember the true is the separation of the complete versus a partial. No need for a partial salvation. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now remember, Israel would come down and every year they would offer a sacrifice and you've heard it preached on so many times of how that they would stand back and look and the family would be watching as daddy would take in a sacrifice and and they would put it on the fire and and the way that they was taught was that if that smoke just went straight up. You was an outcast for a year. &gt;&gt; But if that smoke went up and the hand of God took it and pulled it, &gt;&gt; then God had accepted it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. My sins are gone. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For one year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They had a partial salvation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For one year or their sins was pushed forward for a year. &gt;&gt; Next year they go through the same thing. Oh Lord, am I good enough? Are you going to accept my sacrifice? Have I done everything just right. Is there something that I've missed? &gt;&gt; And they're waiting to see if that smoke is accepted of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; All my sins are gone for a year. &gt;&gt; But now though, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now though, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. that was done away with because that was only a shadow of the real salvation of the full salvation of the complete &gt;&gt; that when the Lord Jesus hanging on the cross could say it is finished &gt;&gt; it was done &gt;&gt; it was done &gt;&gt; I'd like to take from this &gt;&gt; a subject for just a few minutes of a total deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A total deliverance, &gt;&gt; not a partial deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. On the tape in 1959 of a total deliverance. Uh we brother said we want complete deliverance. We don't want to be a halfway church. We want to be a real church &gt;&gt; or no church at all. &gt;&gt; We want to be real Christians or no Christians at all. We want total deliverance from our habits from our sin, &gt;&gt; from our evil thinking, &gt;&gt; from our evil doing &gt;&gt; from our negligence. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; there are sins of commission, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Things we do &gt;&gt; and there are sins of omission when the Lord just nudges you a little bit. Force you need to do this. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I I I'll do it. And then we get busy. That's right. &gt;&gt; We let everyday life just come in on top of us and the Well, I I've got to do this. Uh oh, I've got to pay these bills. Oh, I've got to get gas so that I I can go to church tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And what the Lord told me that I needed to do, I forget. Amen. &gt;&gt; From our negligence. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Go to bed at night. You Oh, Lord. I was going to call that brother. You laid him on my heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Maybe y'all don't do that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, I I I could tell you something else, but it it it take too long to go into it, but I I I had a time I I I'll go into it a little bit. There was a a prophecy that was given. A sister went in the back room and wrote it down. Took it and give it to the pastor. And he had three men to judge it. And all three of them said the same thing. I don't know who it's talking about, but it's of God. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And the pastor had had told us about it and three or four and uh uh He said uh it said actually what was written was one is a bleeding lamb the other dressed in wool and uh brother David said our pastor he said it said that they're both sheep and I thought no that's not what he said Brother David doesn't read very well. I went home that night. I I four or five hours. The only thing I could ever find and dressed in wool was a wolf in sheep's clothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I thought, man, I've I've got to tell brother D. And uh I got busy and I forgot. And about two weeks later, he said, "You know, we had that prophecy that the sister wrote down and and it was judged that it was of God." He said, "And uh I thought I didn't tell him You talk about dilemma. You don't know whether to disrupt church service or what. And I went over to the guitar and I sat down. I thought, Lord, if you'll let me live till the end of this service, I won't forget this time. And as soon as a he dismissed service, normally we'd sit there and play for another five minutes or something till everybody has exited out. Not this time. I wretched over and turned my amplifier off. I went in the back room. I said, "Brother, I need to talk to you." He said, "What is it?" I I said, "You said that both of those were sheep." He said, "Yeah." He said, "That's what it said." I said, "But it didn't say that." He said, "What do you mean?" I said, "It said that one was a bleeding lamb, the other dressed in wool. And he said it didn't I said brother it did that's what you read to me and and he said here he said you know I don't read good said you read it to me and I read it to him and it was just that way and he said oh my I said brother David I knew I was supposed to told you about this two weeks ago. I said, "But I I I went home uh uh went through every quote I could find, but when you brought it up today, I knew I had to tell you right now." He said, "Thank you so much." [clears throat] &gt;&gt; That answers a lot of questions for me. And he knew then what it was and how to deal with it. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, when God comes on the scene and God speaks, you don't have to worry about whether it's right or wrong because the Lord has never been wrong. &gt;&gt; We don't need a when &gt;&gt; when that which is perfect has come, that which was done in part was done away with. Yes. &gt;&gt; He understood it one way, but when it was made plain, he didn't need what was misunderstood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because here's the the actual &gt;&gt; laying there rather than looking at the shadow of it. Do you understand there what I'm saying? No need for partial salvation. Here is the whole of it. Just like Jesus isn't a part of God, he is God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Here at home this past week, one of the tapes that I listened to was Victory Day. And on it, Brother Brandham was telling a story about that they was out somewhere and and a brother handed him his binoculars and the binoculars was set for the brother. But when the prophet of God put it up, he saw three analopee instead of one. &gt;&gt; But the brother had told him there's one analopee. And he said, "Well, because I knew there was one because that's what the brother had said. But I was seeing three. He said, "Isn't that just about what people's done with water baptism?" That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Instead of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, they see three. Oh, but praise God that we had a prophet that knew how to dial in the binoculars. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. WHY? BECAUSE GOD HAD ALREADY SENT A MAN by the name of PAUL THAT HAD DIALED IN the binoculars in his day. &gt;&gt; That they were baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A total deliverance. We want total deliverance &gt;&gt; so that when people come into this church to be prayed for. &gt;&gt; There'll be just this little group, maybe not over a hundred or two sitting here, &gt;&gt; but they'll be completely in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we pray, then God will hear from heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants somebody that he can hold in his hand. &gt;&gt; Somebody that he can say, "I've got confidence. &gt;&gt; I can send this my sick servant to the Brandon Tabernacle at Jeffersonville." And that group of people are in one accord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Not one thought over here and another and here and another and over here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But in one accord &gt;&gt; many people &gt;&gt; but in one accord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something will happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something will happen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I believe it's happening right now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell people, we're not divided. &gt;&gt; When you're hurting up here in Minneapolis, we hurt with you in Arkansas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I heard that Sister Dall had to uh Brother Juan had called me up and said that she had to go into the hospital there. What's it been a couple weeks ago? CS We went to prayer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we bear one another's &gt;&gt; burden. &gt;&gt; When you're hurting, we hurt. When we're hurting down there, you hurt up here. &gt;&gt; But why? Because it's the love that we have. Then as part of the body is hurting, the rest of the body &gt;&gt; will compensate. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You bruise up one foot, &gt;&gt; the rest of the body will take up the pressure &gt;&gt; that that one foot &gt;&gt; can't take. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because it's hurting too bad. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's just more of the manifestation of the characteristics of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A total deliverance. &gt;&gt; And God identifying himself by his characteristics. The prophet of God in paragraph 34 it reads like this. And this God raised up a prophet named Moses. And the man was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and no doubt but he was a great smart intellectual man. He could teach the Egyptians wisdom. Looked like a proper fit fitted man for deliverance. But you see what we call deliverance and what God calls deliverance is some difference. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody comes up to the altar and a a a newcomer might come in amongst us and and he says, "Preacher, I I need deliverance." and what he's got in mind that he needs to give up the smoking habit because his daddy died of lung cancer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we think, oh, if he gives up smoking, &gt;&gt; but that's just a partial deliver. &gt;&gt; That's not a total deliver. But when something gets down INSIDE THE SOUL OF THAT MAN, then he's no longer the same. [applause] And it's not that I refuse to smoke a cigarette, but there's nothing in here that's craving for that. That's a total deliverance. [cheering] Then instead of craving after a nicotine habit, IT'S CRAVING FOR MORE and more and more of God until it's totally filled &gt;&gt; a total deliverance. &gt;&gt; We're not content &gt;&gt; to see people get a partial deliver. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. Do we have to preach a closline religion? Yes, we do. You remind the people, and sometimes there's newcomers that come in that maybe they haven't heard it, or or maybe it's somebody that they've heard it before, but they just let the cares of life choke them out. &gt;&gt; You remember the parable of the seeds? Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of them fell there among briars and and it just choked them out and and jobs choke us out and and and finances just choke us out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't need somebody to come by with a weed eater and just trim back a little bit. &gt;&gt; No way. We need somebody to come through and dig out the root &gt;&gt; of what's choking us out. &gt;&gt; And that surgical sword of the Lord Jesus knows just exactly how to do it. And it don't miss nothing. The doctor MIGHT GO IN AND CUT out a disease, but he may not get all the roots of it out. But I want you to know that that same disease in the presence of almighty God, it is annihilated. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Total deliverance. &gt;&gt; Listen to to brother Brandham talking about of how that the doctors give a man up. He said, "Oh, but five minutes in the presence of God and it was finished." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. a great smart intellectual man. He could teach the Egyptians wisdom. Looked like a proper fit man for deliverance. And then he said, "But you see what we call deliverance and what God calls deliverance is something else." With all of his wisdom, with all of his military training, the only thing that Moses could do in that realm of his life is kill one Egyptian and get run out of town. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch this man with all of his ethics. He knowed that he was born to deliver the children of Israel. Yet with all of his education, that's all he knowed about. And knowing that he was called of God to do a job, he had all of his he had his bachelor of art and his PhD and his doubleld and so forth. And he went out to deliver Israel and was a total &gt;&gt; failure. &gt;&gt; Failure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The right man sure was commission on his life. Sure did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he hadn't come face to face with that pillar of fire yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But I want you to notice after the Lord had taken 40 years now to get all of Egypt out of him. I think that's what we need to do is lay in the presence of the son and let him take all of Egypt out of us. Think all the worldliness out of us. &gt;&gt; TAKE ALL THE INDIFFERENCE out of us. That when the word of God comes to us that you can't hold us down. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we just uh met up with some people here uh this past uh uh last week preaching a funeral for a a a Christian gentleman that died four days short of his 100th birthday. &gt;&gt; Character. Character. World War II vet. Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Had two bronze stars for bravery &gt;&gt; in battle. His family found out about it last week when the military sent his war records. &gt;&gt; He never made mention of it. Or you you take some halfbaked politician, they brag about what they didn't do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. But here's a real man. &gt;&gt; That he's been there. He's done that. &gt;&gt; I made mention of it in his funeral. I said a man with enough courage that he was one of them that kicked down the doors on the prison camp that he had for the Jews that Hitler had in Germany. And yet so humble &gt;&gt; that awarded two bronze stars and his own family. &gt;&gt; Oh God help me to be humble. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, we we get talking to your pastor while over lunch today. He'd taken me out to eat a little bit and and and I I told him of a thing that a I'd heard that a a man that was a teacher at a seminary had a a list of names of of students that he had that had walked away from the Lord. And when he was trying to to uh compare the names and uh were they from the same family? No. Were they from the same state? No. He could only find one common thread. &gt;&gt; But they were all proud. &gt;&gt; God protect us from &gt;&gt; not ever. Let's glorify the Lord. Yes. But whenever it points back to the man, don't do that. You'll only [applause] lift up somebody. &gt;&gt; Praise &gt;&gt; all of his training. But when he come back after the Lord had done a work in his life and he trimmed this off of Moses. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you sisters, you're just going to have to forgive me. But brother Brandham said that, you know, his Moses's wife Zapora had a temper and and Moses had a temper, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; And said, I imagine it wasn't too pleasant sometimes back there on the back side of &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like two brick walls fighting with each other. Ain't neither one of them going to move whether I'm right. No, I'm right. No, I'm &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes, &gt;&gt; God's got a way of &gt;&gt; I heard somebody say something here not too long ago said, you know, after all of that arguing and fussing and then when Moses met the pillar of fire, God told him said, "Take your shoes off." &gt;&gt; How many times have us men heard that when we come tracking him? But no, you know what? It was the only thing between Moses and holy ground was his shoes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he had to get rid of everything so it was just him and holy ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But but a after God had stripped all of that kind of junk off of him and had to cut this off and that off and something else off and this pride had to go. all of his military training. The man that could stand before Pharaoh and even be a spokesman for Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; Now has a stutter and can't talk. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But God had him in condition. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Right? &gt;&gt; He got him humbled down where he could use him. &gt;&gt; Where he didn't think that he was something and instead he'd even argue with God to go down to Egypt. Lord, how can I I I I I I I I can't even talk. I'll give you your brother to be your mouthpiece. What's in your hand? &gt;&gt; Wasn't thinking about that earlier, s but there it is. &gt;&gt; Cast it down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now pick it back up again. A snake. Me pick it up. Pick it up. When he did turn back to the rock. Now he's got him word. He's listening to God &gt;&gt; and he's obeying God because now he knows God. &gt;&gt; He'd heard about God when he was just a little baby. His mama whispered into his ear, "You're going to be the deliverer. Jehovah is the one. You're in his hands." when when all the rest of the little babies your size was killed, but God was keeping you aside for the service. &gt;&gt; He had heard it. &gt;&gt; But now he's hearing it for the first time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That when God speaks that he can listen. And now he goes back and remember he didn't have the Bible like you and I have. He didn't have the message like you and I've got 1,200 tapes. &gt;&gt; But what he had was the word of God that said, "Let my people go." And that was all that he had need. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. GOD ALWAYS SUPPLIES his people. That whatever we have need of that he's given. When you get the HOLY GHOST, YOU'VE GOT everything that you need for the life. [cheering] [applause] We've already got say, "Oh, I I need I need this. I need that. I need this. I need that." No, you just need to lay down your doubts. &gt;&gt; God's already given it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Moses told Pharaoh, he said, "We're going to go out on the desert and worship." And the devil through Pharaoh was trying to make a deal. He says, "Well, if you want to go out, go ahead, but leave. Leave your wives. Leave your children in Egypt. You can go meet with God, but you got to leave all of your inheritance. You got to leave your flocks here with me for ransom. &gt;&gt; That man, he didn't have a manage anointing. He didn't have an eagle age anointing. He didn't need it. All he had was the words that God had spoke to him. &gt;&gt; And he said, "No, we're going to take our sons. We're going to take our daughters. We're going to take our flocks. We're going to take our herds. And we ain't even leaving a stinking hoof behind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I think that the church of THE LIVING GOD, WE'RE TO HAVE THAT SAME commandment tonight. No devil, we ain't giving you our kids. No, devil, we're not giving you our worship. Not one little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time, church, that we put our foot down of the head of the &gt;&gt; devil. &gt;&gt; In our lowest place, &gt;&gt; our position is still over the enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter how low that we get, no matter how beat down, &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; that a son of God is, there's still a son or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan longs for your position, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He wanted He wanted &gt;&gt; worship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; Oh my. I ain't never thought of this before. Can you imagine how turned inside out that the devil is every time that one child of God recognizes his position because all the angels are saying and Satan couldn't get them to do that for him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's what he was longing after. That's what he fell on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. want your position. &gt;&gt; And too many times we let it just go over the top of our head and just because the enemy whispers something in our ear, we might even start agreeing with him. No, church, don't even give place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I may get into just a little something here that brother Juan may w want to come behind me and correct me and that's fine. That that's what he can do. But I've had people to come and tell me, "Oh, brother Farmer, you need to go look at believe the sign and see what they're saying so that you know how to stand against it." No, I don't need to give place to the enemy. &gt;&gt; That's right. I don't need that. &gt;&gt; I don't need it, father. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Put down &gt;&gt; the things of darkness. I don't need to go and see what they're saying. &gt;&gt; I don't need to listen to rock music, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So that I know what I need to be playing in church. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I don't have to listen to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was talking to somebody here just the other day. I said, "Why in the world are people trying to go in their worship? Do you know why they set up a smoke machine? They'll have their blue lights and red lights and and and got a smoke machine going where it looks smoky in there." Well, you know, I've seen that presence before. The night Anna got the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; we was in there in the living room praying and we got we thought that we were done and my daughter just didn't want to quit and mama got on one side of her and I was on the other and she said, "Honey, so have you got what you need?" And she just started crying and I said, "Boys, we ain't done yet. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; The light was on in the kitchen and about 45 minutes or however long that it was after. Sometimes you lose all track of time. I just love getting lost in the presence of almighty God where he is. And we ain't worried about time. We ain't worried about this and something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when we got done, &gt;&gt; Yes. She had broke through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And looking into the kitchen, it looked like it was just filled up with fog or smoke. &gt;&gt; I've seen it two or three times since then. Yes. &gt;&gt; But because the world can't produce that, &gt;&gt; they'll buy a little machine that it's kicking up some folk and they'll shine a light on it so that it looks like what was happening in the tabernacle when they was dedicating it and the shikina glory come down. But why? Why would the prophet of God MADE A STATEMENT? HE SAID, "Why would you accept something that's a false impersonation &gt;&gt; WHEN THE SKIES ARE FULL of Virginia wines?" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would I want to go and see how some mega church is conducting their pre-ervice &gt;&gt; WHEN I'VE BEEN CALLED OUT OF THAT? &gt;&gt; THE VOICE OF GOD TO THE BRIDE WAS COME OUT OF my &gt;&gt; You don't belong there. That's right. &gt;&gt; You're an eagle. You don't belong in a chicken house. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would I want to go back to clucking with the chickens? &gt;&gt; Why? Why? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine? &gt;&gt; You know, I was in a place one time here. It's been 12, 15 years left. 15 anyway. And I was back up in the mountains of Arkansas and I was doing a job and and I heard eagle scream and I got to looking and it's the only time that I've ever seen those eagles tied up in their mating ritual of how that he'll scream and then lock their claws together and just spiral down eyeballs like a David, I can't imagine an eagle getting up there and and dropping a big old limb and then just to show off to his sweetheart what he's capable of, he'll let that limb get down a hundred yards below him and then he'll sink going straight down in a nose dive and grab that stick and then bring it back up to show her what he got. &gt;&gt; Amen. has let go of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE'S AN EAGLE. &gt;&gt; I can't imagine that eagle getting up there and [laughter] &gt;&gt; no, he ain't a chicken. &gt;&gt; He's an eagle. &gt;&gt; He ain't going to sound LIKE A CHICKEN. HE DON'T ACT LIKE A CHICKEN. He don't feed on chicken food. &gt;&gt; Feed on eagle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's got a total of limb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got something oh that he can be proud of up there. &gt;&gt; But you know, it seems like in this day and age, there's too many preachers preach too many churches that's preaching such a watered down version of the Bible. But Hebrews 13:8 said Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; God hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's man and their systems that's changed. &gt;&gt; God's people ain't changed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. We're still We are still worshiping God &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it seems like it in too many ways, so many times that folks just looking more and more like the world. They're choosing to have a bigger crowd instead of having some oldfashioned heartfelt conviction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That would get down and say, "Lord, is it me?" &gt;&gt; If somebody can't get healing in the church, Lord, is it me? Am I the one that's hindered? Now, y'all was shouting just a second ago. &gt;&gt; This is shouting material right here. &gt;&gt; See, because when I get me cleaned out, y'all remember the little story about it? a woman that was complaining about the neighbor's clothes being so dirty on the that was hanging up on the wash line. Finally, she had a belly full of it and she went down to tell that woman and said, "Aren't you embarrassed to be hanging dirty clothes out like this?" And she said, "Well, h said my clothes aren't dirty." and said, "I I seen them." And they went and looked and it was dirty. And she went back up and run a thumb across her window and her thumb was black. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. But maybe maybe it ain't maybe it ain't the preacher that's so mad, but it's me that I've just let some things come in and and and just cloud up my vision and it clouds up the way that I'm looking out at some things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. I believe it does us all real good just to have a good oldfashioned house cleaning sometime &gt;&gt; and to say, "Oh Lord, it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. Oh Lord, get me cleaned up." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We used to sing that song when the the coal of fire had touched the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. making him as pure as pure. &gt;&gt; Then send me Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, instead of preaching a total deliverance, I wonder if maybe we've got in a habit &gt;&gt; of just managing unbelief. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, you take somebody that's got a drinking problem and and they refuse to go down to an altar, but they'll go down to a deal called alcoholic synonymous. &gt;&gt; And you know what? They'll have them to say, "I'm a recovering alcoholic." &gt;&gt; But what I'm going to do is I'm going to limit how much I drink, manage them. Are you hearing me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody comes up with a problem and you say, "Well, but uh uh brother, you don't do it as much as you used to. Oh, you're fine. Just come on in. Just put some money in the offering. Just keep paying your tithes." No, it's not all right. It is somebody that is under bondage that needs a deliverance. needs a total deliverance. We don't need to slow down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I heard a a a man speaking. Some of y'all may even know who it is because it was a message preacher somewhere that said that he would go around to to some of the youth meetings and just anonymously he would hand out these uh papers for them to to look at and to write down. and said that 90% of most of the young men were addicted to pornography &gt;&gt; because of their phone &gt;&gt; and 60% of the girls &gt;&gt; at message youth camp. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the brother said, "And in some assemblies it was 100% of the boys. &gt;&gt; I ain't content with that." &gt;&gt; I said, "I ain't content with that." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And yet they'll have them playing music. They'll have them singing. They'll have them doing this or that. What we need to do first is to get our life cleaned up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's get them to Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's good to get them in church. &gt;&gt; But it's that's not the finished work. &gt;&gt; Could we just use the Lord Jesus as an example? I believe he's a wonderful one &gt;&gt; to use as an example, don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Calvary was not the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Thank you. No, Calvary was not the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, the the word had to be fulfilled. And if the word said that he would lay in there for three days, that had to be accomplished. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you know what? While the Lord Jesus was in the tomb, they had wrapped him up in the the grave clothes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I heard a singer one time that that in the song said the winding clothes that they wrapped him in. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; But when that stone was rolled away, those clothes were laid aside. He didn't have any more needs for them. But I want you to know tonight that there's many a people that they may be still IN THEIR TOMB OF UNBELIEF and besetting sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you don't have to stay in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your time has been accomplished when the angel has come and rolled away the stone and told you that you can go free. You don't have TO STAY IN THERE. You can take off ALL OF THOSE GRAVE clothes and leave them behind and walk out in victory the same way that the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; A total victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not content with sin. are the young people that are struggling with this and struggling with that and struggling with something else. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want to see them get delivered. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't care how long that it takes. &gt;&gt; If we have to pray with them all night, you know, in the upper room, &gt;&gt; all night. in the upper room. &gt;&gt; They had been up there for several days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we hear the prophet of God that he's diagraming what had happened up there and said, "Well, Peter, I think we've been up here long enough, don't you?" &gt;&gt; Peter looked at and said, "Until?" &gt;&gt; Until. &gt;&gt; He said, "Until." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until what? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're endued with power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they just went to praying, &gt;&gt; seeking the Lord again. &gt;&gt; And you know what? It may not even happen the next day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But one day it did happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when it happened, they came out and they was no longer the same people that was went into the upper room, but men that was ashamed to to say that they had even been with JESUS WAS NOW STANDING OUT ON THE STREET corner proclaiming when they come up and made fun of him and said, "Oh, y'all are drunk." He said, "We're drunk." All right. But it's not &gt;&gt; proposed, [applause] &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is that that Joel spoke of when he said that your young men, your young women, I pour OUT MY SPIRIT ON ALL FLESH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; They were the manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of overcoming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He wasn't ashamed of it no more. You didn't have to worry about Junior reccombing his hair when he went to school. &gt;&gt; You know, there's just something about conviction. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sister Carlin said, "Here, I fond memory of that day, but we was out there at your house. Brother Scotty had come by to pick me up at the motel. We was going to have breakfast over there at their house. And her brother, a doctor, he thinks he's Presbyterian. He ain't no more Presbyterian now. He'd had his truck in the shop several days before and they changed out a fuel pump on it. and and uh he come over and his niece had come up from down at at Manchester, Tennessee uh uh for the meetings and and so he come over to to visit Sister Carlin and and his niece and and he gets ready to go and and he comes back there on the back porch and he said, "Well, I hear you're going to be the preacher." And I said, "Well, really, I hope the Lord Jesus is going to be the preacher." And he said, "I I like that." He said, 'Well, where are you taking your subject from? And I said, 'Well, Lord willing, I'll start out with it. And I told him what scripture it was, and he goes, "Oh my." He said, "Uh, you could go about three or four different ways with that." And I thought, "What?" And I said, "Yes, sir, you could." And I told him what I was planning on titling it that day, that evening. And he said, "Oh," he said, "if I wasn't obligated." He he he said, "I'd like to hear that." Well, come to find out years ago, he started running for his health, but he didn't want to just spend his time running. So, he started memorizing scripture. When I told him what verse I was going to take, he rattles off about six verses above and below where I told him I was at. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Made me ashamed of myself. &gt;&gt; He go he tells him goodbye. He goes downstairs, crawls in his truck, and his truck won't start. told her, said, "Go tell them men to come down and pray for my truck so I can go home." Brother Roberto, is he still around? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I I guess he had been in the Air Force as a mechanic. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And at any rate, he he went down and uh I told him I said, "Well, let's pop the hood." And and we did and you couldn't smell any gas. And I told him I I said, "Well, try and turn it over." And he did. They just yang yang yang yang yang. Brother Roberto said, "Brother Farmer," he's a Air Force mechanic, worked in the motor pool, good mechanic. And he says, "Brother Pal Farmer," he said, 'What do you think it is?' And I said, 'Well, brother, I'm not smelling any gas. I said, 'Th That's certainly not throwing any fire. He said, 'Well, what do you think? I said, I thought it's a fuel problem. And and he said, well, what are we going to do? I said, brother, he didn't ask us to fix his truck. He told us to come down and pray for it. I laid my hand over on the radiator support and your husband come up and laid a hand on my shoulder and it was about like you put a set of jumper cables on. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love [cheering and applause] it when the believers came together in one mind and a [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; just prayed a simple little prayer. Lord, my brothers need this truck to start. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I &gt;&gt; we backed up. &gt;&gt; I said, "Tell him try and start it again." It didn't even make a full revolution and it kicked right off. He jumps out of the truck. He said, "I knew if you all would come down and pray for it that it would start." &gt;&gt; You can't with faith like that. HOW COULD IT NOT HAPPEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES, &gt;&gt; CHURCH. Just trusting God. &gt;&gt; Just trust a total deliverance. He's an everpresent help. &gt;&gt; In the time of trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I went home after that weekend. I was down Mississippi uh uh uh down by Batesville, Mississippi preaching for a little group and I testified about what had happened up here. Okay. &gt;&gt; Actually, there was something else that happened. A a there there was a a a brother out in Idaho that they had a a singing deal out there called Wounded Believers and and they asked uh Brother Dutton to get up and dismiss. And and that that group I I'm not making fun. They're but they're just very structured that that when they tell you to get up and dismiss, you've got 45 seconds to dismiss and start singing Take the name of Jesus with you just the way they are. But brother Frank got up and he said, "Y'all before we dismiss, I just feel led to tell y'all a little bit about my conversion." He's older now, &gt;&gt; but he's going to remind some of the young people, &gt;&gt; you rehearse these things to your children and your children's children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he was going to do that and he got out of the box that they had for him &gt;&gt; and about 15 20 minutes later, we had a prayer line. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Then two weeks later, they had a meeting up in another state up in Genanoa, Illinois. And I went up there because I had a bunch of grandb babies and my my girl was up there. And so we go up and they've got two men that they get up and they've only got about five or seven minutes to speak. I hate going to some place where you have to speak. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with preaching? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's preaching. &gt;&gt; If a bunch of believers are together, that ought to be a problem. &gt;&gt; And these two men, they got out of their box and it was like what had started out in Idaho had carried over into Illinois. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then I'm down here the next week and we prayed for that truck and it started. I go down to Mississippi and I gave witness of it and about three days, three or four days, it was that next week, a brother brought a lawnmower over to the the minister's house and uh he said, "Yeah, I said just get it off there and I I I'll clean the carburetor on it." and he went back in his house and he heard a racket about 15 minutes later and he looked out and that guy had never left and he steps out and his hood was up and he said, "What's going on?" He said, "I don't know." He said, "My truck won't start." And he walked over there and he he said, "Well, have you checked this? Have you checked that? Have you checked this other? Have you checked that other?" and and and the the boy said, "Uh, yes, sir. I've done all that." And he said, "Well, you've done everything I'd think of to check." He said, "And something went through my mind." Said, "Brother Farmer said he laid his hand on the radiator support." So, he just stretch over on the radiator, &gt;&gt; and he prayed for it. He said, "Try starting it now." And it kicked right up. He said, "What'd you do?" said, "I prayed for it." &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Michael gets on the phone. Yeah. That same Michael, brother. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Gets on the phone and calls me and he tells me about it. I called up brother Frank. And I said, "Brother Frank, it was almost like what you started out there just carried on over &gt;&gt; and over and over and over." and and he said, "Brother Farmer, have you ever heard about what happened on the way down to Dale Hollow Lake?" Well, I I knew about the fish being resurrected, uh uh the brother George Burcham, you you remember brother Brandham talking about the brother down in Kentucky that had the cheese factory? Yeah. And he said, "I thought he they made enough cheese to feed the world." He said, "I thought a cheese plant would be a dirty place." He said, "Oh, not that. It was just sparkling." Well, brother George Burcham had taken my father-in-law and me uh out to show us that cove on uh Dale Holler Lake where the fish was resurrected. Well, I'd known about that. And I said, "You're talking about the resurrection of He said, "No, I'm talking about on the way down." And I said, "No, sir. I don't guess I have." And he said, uh, some of y'all remember Brother Brandham telling the story that Brother Banks Woods's brother Kyle, uh, that they was going down through there and Brother Kyle wasn't a believer yet. &gt;&gt; And he said, "If you hadn't went out that window when you did, you'd be a dead man." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he turned around because he knew that nobody knew about that. &gt;&gt; Okay. But God knew about it. &gt;&gt; But as they were going out of Campbellville, they went they drove down a road and one of them either brother Banks or Brother Kyle uh pointed to a house and said, "That's where our uh Adventist Sunday school teacher lived." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and the other one said, "Yeah." said, "We need to stop and tell her that we give our life to the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that what they said so pleased God that God allowed them to see the resurrection of that fish. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, I want you to know that I have dedicated in my life that I want to be found saying something or doing something that so pleases the Lord that I can see his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, I I'm going to close here in just a second. You know the uh in Leviticus and Numbers we read how that the cities of refuge that was established. And there was a condition to that. The roads had to be maintained. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We've read in several places that one of the interpretations said that the road going to a city of refuge had to be almost twice the size of any of the other roads. That's right. And the community that was nearest uh to that road was the ones that was obligated to take care of it. &gt;&gt; The community &gt;&gt; around it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then I've also now I don't believe it that it's anywhere in the Levitical law, but what they actually established was that the there had to be signs that was clearly pointing to the city of refuge. &gt;&gt; And they even made those signs a certain size. But then they established it that it become a habit that there had to be two people that would go with the man that was fleeing to a city of refuge that knew the way. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, help us that know the way THAT WHEN SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO GET BACK to that city of refuge. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then remember, &gt;&gt; they had to stay there in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I heard someone say here the other day that they had looked it up and there were 83 high priests uh uh uh both before David and after David uh that had went off the scene. So they had 83 of those jubilee times that then a manslayer was not compelled to stay in there. But at the death of the high priest, but those high priests was only a shadow &gt;&gt; of the high priest &gt;&gt; that after the death of the high priest, we wasn't compelled to stay in a city of refuge. But we had our freedom. We had total liberty. &gt;&gt; A total deliverance. &gt;&gt; Church, our families, we have responsibility. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not just to tell them, &gt;&gt; but to show &gt;&gt; to show them you daddies. I'm gonna get on your case for just a minute. &gt;&gt; Go right ahead. &gt;&gt; I know the prophet of God said that mama was a pastor to her little congregation. &gt;&gt; And he said there's not four gospels, there's five gospels, Mark, Luke, John, and Mama. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You sisters, you you've got a great commission right there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know with our children we we show them love. We show them support. But Ephesians 6 and verse four doesn't tell us to raise them with wealth &gt;&gt; and luxury. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; No. And I know a lot of times people misstate this verse and they call it in the fear and admonition of the Lord, but that's not really what it says. &gt;&gt; What it says is the nurture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the admonition of the Lord. But yet when I looked up that word nurture because the way that we use it in the English language, it it's looking as unto nourishment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it don't mean that. That's &gt;&gt; right. What it meant was chastisement instruction which aims at increasing value. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; An admonition was to teach, to warn, and exhort. [crying] &gt;&gt; Amen. our children &gt;&gt; in the way of the Lord &gt;&gt; and us daddies. &gt;&gt; We have a name around the house &gt;&gt; of husband. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know where that word comes from? We don't have the word agriculture in the Bible. &gt;&gt; It's not in here. &gt;&gt; But there's another word for it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's called husbandry. &gt;&gt; And the man that is engaged in that is the husband man. He is responsible for the growth of the fields that he has. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And our families. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are our fields. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, we've got pastor mom, but we've also got priest daddy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we're responsible. &gt;&gt; It's not my job and brother Juan's job and the other ministers job in here to get your children through to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That is actually yours. We are to have them in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are to have them in the instruction of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are to be teaching them line upon line. Let me tell you something. The ministry can't make up for 24 hours a day with three hours a week if we make all the services. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can't compete with the time that a teacher has when they're spending eight hours in front of them just to plant things in their mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. But &gt;&gt; we're responsible. Amen. While we were, brother Juan, while we were up there in Sabino Canyon under Eagle Rock, I told you I pro we had church up there. Well, I brought up something else that the other brothers had never heard of. It's on return in Jubilee. Are y'all familiar with that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had preached down at brother Jack Moore's church and what they uh the outpouring of the Holy Ghost fell at Isuza Street in ' 06. I'm going to let you go in just a few minutes, but bear with me here for for Six years later in Louisiana, they had an outpouring of the Holy Ghost like what they had at Isuza Street. And that's the reason why that not in 56 but in 62 that brother Brandham was preaching return and jubilee. The night before or the morning before that brother Brandham preached Returning Jubilee, there was an older brother that had been at Isuza Street at that outpouring and he preached that morning. &gt;&gt; And at the end of the service, Brother Brandham turns around, don't don't turn the tape off when they start singing. go through that worship service. And brother Brandham turns around to the brother. He had sent brother Fred Soffman on down to Shreport. They him and brother Billy got caught in a storm and had to spend the night in Little Rock and didn't get down till later in the day. But brother Fred recorded it. And evidently, Brother Brandham must have listened to it or talked to somebody that had been there. And he turns around, he said, "Let me ask this old patriarch." He said, "Brother, the things I preached about tonight," he said, "Is that the things that you all fought for back then?" And you hear this old man He says absolutely &gt;&gt; he said in the beginning it was wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was wonderful. He said but step by step we fell into the clutches of the machinery of human genius making. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "In order to save the movement, we've got to go back." &gt;&gt; We've got to go back. &gt;&gt; And he's crying. And brother Brandham takes the mic back and he said, "Hear the cry of that old patriarch." &gt;&gt; We've got to go back. &gt;&gt; My mama and daddy was first generation. I'm second. &gt;&gt; My baby that y'all may have met up at brothers brother Wart's funeral Anna and Daniel Miller. That's that's my kids. I I don't have a son-in-law. I got eight kids now. Still four. Anna and my three boys are third generation. My grandbabies are fourth generation. They've been exposed to the message all of their lives. In the Ephesian church age on page 88, brother Brandham says, "Revelation 2 and4, nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To understand this, you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of Ephesus alone. The message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years. Its message then is to all the generations in that span. &gt;&gt; Now history keeps repeating itself &gt;&gt; in the generations of Israel. We see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next. &gt;&gt; If you've ever read all the way through the book of Judges, &gt;&gt; they get down here again and the Lord brings them another judge and he delivers them. One time it was even a woman judged Deborah. Then they're back down here. Then they're back up. Then they're back down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel. We see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next. In the third generation, embers may be glowing slightly. But in the fourth generation, There may be no vestage whatsoever of that original flame. &gt;&gt; Church, that's why I'm crying out. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to get these young ones &gt;&gt; to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It'll be worth every minute that we spend. It'll be worth every every night that instead of us being engaged in something else, but we've got our children or our grandchildren sitting down in the living room and go back through these things that they can experience and then try to get them in an atmosphere of worship where they can feel the power of God the way that it got a hold of you and I. &gt;&gt; Without that there will be no resemblance. &gt;&gt; And remember the original is not only a name and a resemblance. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But it's that same. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If that same spirit &gt;&gt; dwells in you &gt;&gt; that raised Christ from the dead, &gt;&gt; it'll quicken your mortal body. It'll quicken my children's mortal body. I've got a grandbaby right now that by the grace of God, I've got three of them that by the grace of God, they're on fire for God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One of them is leading some children in their church that they want to see the rest of the children have a revival in that church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; What does that see a mama and a daddy or a grandma and a grandpa that's crying out for more of God &gt;&gt; and it inspires &gt;&gt; it encourages. &gt;&gt; That's right. Church, don't give up. &gt;&gt; Don't give up. This is no time for us to slow down. &gt;&gt; You notice a runner, &gt;&gt; I don't care if he's trained to run a marathon. &gt;&gt; And I know the scripture tells us to run with patience, the race that's set before us. But there is something that happens in a runner's body when he sees the finish line &gt;&gt; just ahead of him that he's been pacing himself down. &gt;&gt; But right there at the very last he is not only running but he is sprinting &gt;&gt; across that finish line. When they get done, &gt;&gt; they may just fall on the ground. &gt;&gt; They may be on all fours &gt;&gt; panting, &gt;&gt; but I think of this song. &gt;&gt; It'll be worth it after a while, child. &gt;&gt; It'll be worth it after a while. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know all the words to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. They let me play music at home just so I &gt;&gt; I won't sing. &gt;&gt; God's gifted some of us to sing, &gt;&gt; some of us. &gt;&gt; But church, I want you to know I'm not content to sat down. &gt;&gt; I had a friend that he got a a bad medical diagnosis and I wrote a song said Kadesh uh uh Barnea at the gateway to the kingdom. The spies were sent ahead uh to look and see. 10 said we can't do it. But two said we're more than able. Don't say down here. Come run with me. Don't sit down here. Come run with me.

Father, you see our hands raised up to you, Lord. Mine here also, Lord, but what I've seen and just looking up these things, Lord, [music] &gt;&gt; how it's quickened my heart to do more, Lord, to push harder, to encourage more.

[music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just I just want to read that quote there, [music] brother. But fam, started with tonight. Uh Emanuel, I sent it over there to the to the to your to your mail. Can you just put it up for us tonight? We want to just read that and close the service tonight. [music] But I'm telling you, uh I mean, we we becoming so slack and so lazy right now. I mean, we we becoming conscious of our time. We want to run and grab our bed. But I'm telling you that something serious [music] is happening tonight. &gt;&gt; Very serious. &gt;&gt; I was on my way to church tonight and I was just talking to a young person and just uh uh [music] speaking some things to them and you know counseling them and I just told them the very same thing. &gt;&gt; I says uh uh we we we we have a crisis. That's right. &gt;&gt; We have a we have an epidemic. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That we don't want to admit. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; we have an epidemic. We have a problem on our hands. &gt;&gt; Lot of our young people [music] have already been defied in their mind by the things that they are exposed to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We have a problem on our hands. And until we begin to see that it concern us, we have a problem on our hands. And I was just [music] telling that young person on the phone, I say sir, I mean uh we we we we just think that uh uh uh is is going to be okay when we get married or we just think that and and that is the reason why we can't even keep a home. We can't keep a family. It's true. &gt;&gt; We have a problem on our head. It's a serious problem. Doctors will tell us that uh this is the worst thing that you can put in the hands of your child. truth. &gt;&gt; But that's the age that we in. That's the place where we find ourself. And then we just we just sit back. We give it to them for entertainment because we don't want them to bother us. Let's read that quote together and then we go to the Lord in prayer. Oh, you listen to me as I try to read it. If our heart condemn us now after we being preached to tonight the way we being preached to tonight, church, if we would just don't take this service like just an ordinary service. I don't care even if we don't have service [music] tonight. If we stay late and you don't want to come to church tomorrow, that's up to you. You can stay home and enjoy your sleep. But what is the need of coming here and being exposed to the word of God and the Holy Spirit will speak to us like this and we just say that quick prayer jump in our car and go right back into the same thing. What is the reason? What is THE REASON? WHAT WHAT IS the need of having service? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we are NOT READY TO GET IF WE ARE NOT READY TO get serious with God. &gt;&gt; Yes. If how if our hearts will condemn us now, I don't believe the preacher preached to condemn us tonight. He preached to convict us. &gt;&gt; We need to come to some sense of conviction. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We always looking for who to blame. We're always looking for who to look around. That is the cause of our problem. If our hearts will condemn us now, &gt;&gt; we want complete deliverance. I don't know about you, but I want complete deliverance. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want complete deliverance. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; I I mean it's just not a time to just uh preach and just you just want to keep people in church. If I can't help you, what is the need of just keeping people around &gt;&gt; or trying to make a name for ourself? We hear these things that [music] they just they just uh I mean uh uh we we get so used to them we can quote them before the preacher. We can we have another quote to counter out what the preacher is saying. &gt;&gt; We want complete deliverance. We don't want to be a halfway church. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be a halfway church. We get scared before people stop coming to church because we think we uh when we get so high on the word we are discouraging them. That person need a birth. &gt;&gt; They need to be born again. The Bible says that no man join himself to the apostles. &gt;&gt; The apostles were not seeking for members. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They were seeking for people to be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They wanted people to have an EXPERIENCE WITH GOD, &gt;&gt; NOT JUST TO FILL the church. Let me tell you something that you don't know or maybe you don't know about me. But sometimes when we bring these brothers, it is not just because one other church is having special meetings. We want to have special meetings. We prayed about these things and sometimes [music] not not just to bring a man in the pullpit that would get us excited and and you know make us laugh and and [music] just enjoy the word. I believe if there is ever the time we need godly men in the pull pit, man that has godly life. If if if there is nothing brother Farmer said tonight that you are connected with there is one thing that I know that is that is that [music] is present in this building that he's a man that has a life that witness to everything he preach. &gt;&gt; It's not how it's not how loud the person preach is the life that is behind the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. It has to be a life of concentration, a life of prayer, a life of godliness. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's someone [music] that is struggling with some kind of a habit or you always in some kind of a gossip or always in some kind of a church conflict. If our heart condemn us, we want a complete deliverance. I don't know if that's how you feel in your heart tonight. If your heart is not condemning you, but if there is something speaking in your heart tonight, saying, "God, I [music] need a complete deliverance. I need to get to [music] the place of a clean Christian life. I need to stop all my nonsense and get to a place of a clean Christian life. THERE IS NO WAY YOU can make the Holy Ghost to tolerate sin in your life. It's not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the strength of God. So you cannot make something your weakness. You say that's my weakness. The Holy GHOST HAVE COME TO EMPOWER YOU &gt;&gt; TO RISE YOU ABOVE THAT. And if the HOLY GHOST IS IN YOUR LIFE, IT WILL LIFT YOU ABOVE THAT. THE HOLY GHOST WILL NOT BE comfortable with your weakness. Let's read there so we can pray tonight. If our heart condemn us there, we want a complete deliverance. We don't want to be a halfway church. We want to be a real church or no church at all. It's either a real church or no church at all. We cannot be in the middle. We cannot be [music] halfway. We want to be real Christians or no Christians at all. We want total deliverance from our habits. [snorts] We want total deliverance from our habits. I lift my hands up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but [music] I lift my hands up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This thing what the church gets so comfortable with. We wait for preachers to beg people to come to the altar. You must feel God dealing with you and step out of your seat and come to the altar. Don't wait for the preacher who who need prayer tonight. Who is there anybody? And the preacher would beg and he would beg and he would beg. [music] We want total deliverance from our habit, from our sins, from our evil thinking, from our evil doing, from our negligence, whatever we have done. Let's continue. We want total deliverance [music] so that when people come to this church to be prayed for, there will be just this little group. Just this little group. Just this little group tonight. All those that are in service with us tonight. that are on their knees or having their hands up. Just this little group sitting here, but they will be completely in the hands of God. And when we pray, [music] then God will hear from heaven. If the people that are called by my name will humble themselves. [music] Let's go to the Lord in prayer tonight. I don't know about you, but I don't believe that we just come to a lecture. The preacher preach [music] it was a good sermon. We pray then we just go home. Sometime we have to we have to we have to think about what being preached. We have to digest it. We have to sit there and meditate on it. Let something from the WORD GRAB YOUR HEART and say Lord you were talking to me. I was not paying attention. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You speak to [singing] me. My heart a grief. [music] Father, please come [music and singing] and take control. I feel [music] the poor. Oh, I [music] feel [singing] the poor.

[music] We are looking for fancy preacher. &gt;&gt; We want men that can bring us to the altar. Men that can bring us [music] to our knees. Men that are willing to spend a NIGHT UP AND CRY to God if the people are willing to also stay up and be delivered. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We just get this thing that that just go off in our heads as soon as the preacher say amen.
