[0:00] [Music]
[2:17] when he comes forth looks just like the
[2:19] green but when the green life begins to
[2:24] lead the husk to go into make the grain
[2:28] the bride
[2:31] the husk opens up and excommunicates to
[2:37] grain is that right nature that's
[2:41] exactly what she did in Ro in
[2:43] Revelations 3 we find out the lady see a
[2:45] church AG put him
[2:49] out I see it didn't back in the other
[2:51] ages because there was something else
[2:53] yet to be made it just passed through
[2:55] and went on to another I've told you all
[2:57] along there's no more denominations
[2:58] coming we're at the
[3:01] end and they put him out because why he
[3:06] he's the word
[3:08] again he's like the one that fell down
[3:10] there he's the same doctrine that come
[3:13] forth from the beginning and when the
[3:15] seed word begins to grow forth the husk
[3:18] puts it from itself the life leaves all
[3:21] the others to follow it that's the true
[3:24] believers they follow the life wherever
[3:26] the life go like in Israel a perfect
[3:28] type if we had time and just got a few
[3:29] minutes left but in a perfect type in
[3:32] the beginning everywhere that Pillar of
[3:34] Fire went was life God was at life and I
[3:37] don't care if it's midnight or whether
[3:39] there's in a good selected place when
[3:41] that Pillar of Fire moved the trumpet
[3:43] sounded and Israel moved with it amen
[3:46] hallelujah and when the trumpet sounded
[3:49] Martin Luther moved out with it and he
[3:52] organized killed not he himself the man
[3:55] at him and then God took the life out of
[3:58] that brought it on laid it down the
[4:01] grave then out come Wesley he saw that
[4:04] big organization so he sounded a trumpet
[4:06] of sanctification more of the word see
[4:09] when he did out they moved right out of
[4:12] right out of Luther right into meth
[4:14] Methodist and when Pentecost saw it they
[4:17] sounded a trumpet it's time for the
[4:19] return of the gifts see what they did
[4:22] they sounded a trumpet and out they come
[4:23] then they
[4:25] organized but remember after the husk
[4:28] get three stages we know of
[4:30] there's nothing else left but the green
[4:32] oh
[4:34] God and then the green is put out of all
[4:36] of
[4:38] it amen and
[4:41] amen seed words begins to form itself
[4:45] life it's brought forth out of now
[4:48] notice if the
[4:51] bridegroom the beginning the first
[4:53] bridegroom this is a bride coming forth
[4:56] remember the church begin at Pentecost
[5:01] and it fell at
[5:02] Nia it sprouted not like the real
[5:05] green no it was some of the life in
[5:08] there but it sprouted in order to make
[5:10] an organization and he pulled through
[5:12] that
[5:13] organization and then what did it do
[5:15] then it went from that organization it
[5:17] went into another organization went into
[5:19] another stage of the word justification
[5:21] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[5:24] see and as it went through this stalking
[5:26] process it kept coming on more remember
[5:29] the pollen is more the tossel is more
[5:33] like the seed than the stalk is and the
[5:36] husk is more like the seed than the
[5:38] tossel was but the seed itself is beyond
[5:43] that it just used that for
[5:45] transportation to take itself through
[5:47] notice the bride if the bride in the
[5:50] beginning was the word of the bridegroom
[5:54] and then if the bride is taken from the
[5:57] bridegroom it must be the word
[6:00] also
[6:02] notice the bride must be why why must
[6:06] the bridegroom be the word manifested
[6:08] made plain is because the bride and the
[6:11] bridegroom are
[6:13] one she's just a smitten and piece off
[6:15] of
[6:18] him there's the
[6:20] Masterpiece it was smitten s
[6:24] Michelangelo could not reproduce that
[6:27] again he could not put it back but God's
[6:29] going to do
[6:31] it he's going to bring this little bride
[6:34] smitten right back to the side of the
[6:36] original word and there he is there's
[6:38] the Masterpiece the family back again in
[6:41] Garden of
[6:42] Eden how is this bride going to do this
[6:45] how is this uh wheat go to do this
[6:47] Malachi 4 said in the last days it would
[6:51] be restored back what restored back like
[6:55] the
[6:56] beginning take it back I will restore
[7:00] sayth the Lord all the years of Palmer
[7:02] worm and caner worm and all these other
[7:04] things is eaten I will restore again
[7:07] Malachi for said he will restore the
[7:10] hearts of the people and the faith of
[7:12] the people back to the original fathers
[7:16] against we see this right before us
[7:19] Church where are we
[7:22] at now closing in a few minutes I want
[7:26] you to notice real close but something
[7:28] just happened Malachi 4 is to bring back
[7:31] back to the original she is smitten from
[7:34] the church from the church body smitten
[7:38] with her master for the same purpose
[7:40] she's the word as same as Joseph has
[7:42] smitten from his Brethren because he was
[7:45] the word and Jesus is smitten from his
[7:48] Brethren because he was the word the
[7:51] church is smitten the bride is smitten
[7:53] from the church because she is the word
[7:56] there's your stages again 1 2 three just
[7:58] exactly the word living and in action
[8:03] the Bible bride not some man-made bride
[8:07] the Bible bride smitten and Afflicted of
[8:11] God no Beauty we should
[8:14] desire but yet we did esteen her smitten
[8:17] inflicted of God that's right she stands
[8:20] alone she's smitten from all the
[8:23] denominations according to Revelations 3
[8:25] she's smitten out of the lady of s
[8:26] Church age that she was raised up in see
[8:30] this church was raised up in the lady
[8:32] OFA Church age that's the
[8:34] husk but if them others went can't you
[8:37] Pentecostal man see that if that other
[8:40] was husk and died if that other stalk
[8:42] had to die if the tossel had to die so
[8:44] must the husk
[8:47] die the three stages of
[8:51] organizations and remember he just said
[8:53] well now there's a lot of tosel hanging
[8:54] on there's a lot of this yeah they've
[8:56] been Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[8:57] Lutheran Church of Christ all these
[8:59] other little things that fell on to it
[9:00] leaves and everything else and hung on
[9:01] to it but the original was the
[9:03] reformations I see stands alone like the
[9:07] bridegroom rejected of man despised and
[9:11] rejected of the churches the bride
[9:13] stands that way what is it it's his
[9:16] Masterpiece it's a word that he can work
[9:19] to make manifest rejected so the stalk
[9:23] the tsel and husk never become seed no
[9:28] but are all all the time becoming more
[9:31] like the seed now at the Harvest Time
[9:35] the seed is back to its original life
[9:38] back to the Bible Malachi 4 said it
[9:40] would be brought that way oh oh my must
[9:44] have all to be this way it must have all
[9:48] of the word is that right now what did
[9:53] he say in Revelations 10 that would take
[9:57] place why was a trip the Tucson the open
[10:01] to the church in the days of the
[10:04] messenger of the seventh angel the
[10:06] seventh angel mess the whole word of God
[10:09] would be made manifest the seal that
[10:11] what all the stalk is left off and why
[10:14] and all about it would be made manifest
[10:16] in this time is that what the word
[10:19] say then we see it then where are we at
[10:24] where are we at there's only one thing
[10:26] the Harvest is year she's dead right
[10:30] she's ready now for the coming
[10:33] notice no it'll never be it the at the
[10:36] Harvest Time the seed is back to its
[10:38] original condition and must have all of
[10:42] the word in order to be the
[10:46] seed now you can't have a half a seed it
[10:48] won't
[10:49] grow it's got to be the whole seed it's
[10:52] got to not manifest say I've been the
[10:54] baptism the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I've
[10:55] been speaking in tongu that's just part
[10:56] of the seed
[10:59] but now there added to
[11:02] that Hallelujah see the life not the
[11:07] gifts of Life are the
[11:09] gifts see see what I mean we're at the
[11:13] end time Brethren stalk tossel husk is

[15:14] there when I heard that Lutheran priest
[15:17] or preacher is supposed to be stand up
[15:19] there and say that ridiculous thing and
[15:22] make fun of what we believe in and I'm
[15:24] Full Gospel businessman having that man
[15:27] there and seeing that he wore his collar
[15:30] turned around lots of them do now he
[15:33] said now people ask me why I turn my

[15:43] children he said I know a Catholic
[15:45] priest that's
[15:47] omnipresent that can be present

[15:52] without being ommission God's not even
[15:55] omnipresent God's omn Mission omissions
[15:57] which me makes him om present he knows
[15:59] all thing but in order to be a being he
[16:01] has to be one being but being omn on
[16:04] Mission he can't be omn presentent
[16:05] because he knows all thing and know it
[16:07] before the the you know before the world
[16:09] begin how many fleas lice how many bugs

[16:17] Mission without being infinite there
[16:20] only one thing
[16:21] infinite
[16:24] God and then we what is it it's a devil
[16:29] taking them right straight to that
[16:31] Slaughter every one of them going into
[16:32] exactly what the Bible said and here it
[16:34] is see come right in amongst the
[16:36] Pentecostals and just pull him right
[16:37] straight this
[16:39] is what a time oh after that
[16:44] testimony someone said to
[16:46] me I I it's good thing I didn't say very
[16:49] much because they probably had me in
[16:51] jail up there but I just thought there
[16:54] it is the people who's taught knows the
[16:57] wise shall know their God in that day
[16:59] said Daniel that's the wise will know
[17:02] their God they're watching for these
[17:04] things but when I seen that happen and
[17:06] that Pentecostal stand there with
[17:08] me even or robbers looked at me like
[17:10] that I said oh
[17:12] my but stand up there with the education
[17:16] polish and on so
[17:17] forth that's not the way God polishes
[17:20] his he don't polish his his education he
[17:22] polishes in humility and power of His
[17:26] manifested word showing shape of the
[17:29] grain that it went from now someone said
[17:32] to me said brother brandham said there's
[17:35] one thing I can't understand about
[17:37] you I said what's that stand out there
[17:40] in the hall I guess sister da and then
[17:42] went after to Shu hands a bill and stand
[17:44] there and all up went around the corner
[17:45] a whole bunch of people a minister
[17:47] priced his way in caller turned around
[17:49] he said why is it that you're always
[17:52] balling the people out he said then
[17:55] people believe you to be a servant of
[17:57] God to be and sweet to them and
[18:01] everything said every time I hear you
[18:02] get up you're balling women out about
[18:04] having short hair and about wearing
[18:06] shorts and wearing makeup and all this
[18:08] other stuff and balling the people out
[18:09] and tell them how cold and formal and
[18:11] indifferent they are so why do you do
[18:13] that so then people love you how can you
[18:15] be a loving Son of God and do a thing
[18:18] like that I thought Lord let me answer
[18:20] this smart
[18:21] man just let me answer him somewhere
[18:24] hang him on his own rope and I said well
[18:29] I said sir did you ever read of the
[18:32] great uh
[18:34] uh uh producer of music called a great
[18:39] composer called
[18:40] Beethoven he said oh sure I read a
[18:44] Beethoven I said he probably tore up
[18:48] waste basket fulls of scrap paper but he
[18:51] gave the world
[18:53] masterpieces Hallelujah you never opened
[18:56] his mouth and said another word
[18:59] prise the
[19:00] Lord I said when he was sitting in his
[19:03] study under the inspiration he'd write
[19:05] something down he'd going into his study
[19:06] pray it wasn't right he scrap it up and
[19:08] throw it in the voice basket but when he
[19:10] got through in all inspiration the world
[19:13] had a
[19:14] masterpiece oh how the word
[19:19] Cuts but it produces
[19:23] masterpieces takes all the husk and
[19:24] stalk away it brings forth masterpiece

[20:12] tell the vision I don't know what I can
[20:15] interpreted but I I'm going to tell the
[20:17] vision for my first time I fell into a
[20:20] trance and when I did there was somebody
[20:23] with me I didn't see the person it was
[20:25] just the
[20:27] voice and
[20:29] I I looked and as I I looked this way he
[20:32] said the bride will come in view for a
[20:36] preview I looked coming to me and I seen
[20:42] the
[20:43] most the most prettiest bunch of clean
[20:48] dressed women I ever seen in my life but
[20:51] each one of them looked like was dressed
[20:53] different they all had long hair and
[20:56] they were longer sleeves and skirts and
[20:59] so forth young women it look kind of I'd
[21:01] say about maybe 20 now I have the Bible

[21:18] I can only say what I seen amen I don't
[21:21] I don't know what it all about it I just
[21:24] have to tell you but when this bride she
[21:26] was looking right at the one was talking
[21:29] to me and I standing together her eyes
[21:32] she was the cleanest sweetest looking

[21:46] beautiful I looked at her as she passed
[21:48] by he said now we shall review said

[22:11] group now I am an
[22:14] American but this this made me sick I am
[22:18] not uh eloquent enough to in a mixed
[22:23] audience to say what was taking place uh
[22:27] uh uh and you'll have to read between
[22:29] the
[22:30] lines but when the women were coming the
[22:33] leader of them was a
[22:35] witch she had a great long nose and a
[22:37] great big mouth and all of them was
[22:40] dressed with some kind of lower clothes
[22:42] down here but the top just had a strap
[22:44] that just a little about half inch strap
[22:47] that moved up and went around them like
[22:49] this and each woman had something on the

[23:17] shortcut hair and full of
[23:19] makeup absolutely nothing but look like
[23:22] street
[23:24] prostitutes and they were walking with
[23:26] this paper and the V
[23:29] it now the paper was what was ho in
[23:31] front of them but when they pass the
[23:34] review stand in the back of them and to
[23:37] see the way they were going

[23:59] and I was standing there and in my heart
[24:01] I was crying and this
[24:04] witch to my notion it's nothing else in
[24:07] the world but she's a she's that World
[24:10] Council of churches leading him right
[24:12] straight down the road where she was
[24:14] going they went off to the
[24:17] left and disappeared in
[24:20] chaos still beating this music and
[24:23] making real funny sounds and shaking
[24:27] their bodies one side and the other side
[24:29] and then like that car on like that
[24:31] walking and I just started to bow my
[24:33] head and he said wait the bride must
[24:36] come
[24:37] again and I look and here they come
[24:40] again and they passed by a sweet looking
[24:43] little ladies that's all looking right
[24:45] at me as said pass by and I noticed each
[24:47] one was dressed different and one in the
[24:49] back had kind of long hair hanging down
[24:51] and had it rolled around like this might
[24:53] have been German or something like
[24:55] that and I watch him and then as he
[24:58] start started leaving two or three of
[25:00] them in the back car get out of step and
[25:02] I was going to holler at him and they
[25:03] trying to get back and step again and I
[25:05] seen him just the vision just fade out
[25:07] and change from me now here is the
[25:11] interpretation
[25:14] thereof the reason I remember I had just
[25:18] got through writing I hadn't finished I
[25:20] hadn't wrote these notes yet but in
[25:23] preaching this morning I caught what it
[25:26] was right in my sermon
[25:29] did you notice the church only came in
[25:31] view now that's the truth friends the
[25:33] heavenly father who writes the word
[25:36] knows that I tell the
[25:38] truth I don't I just say the truth and
[25:41] not knowing it till just a few minutes
[25:43] ago look like or just recently see did
[25:47] you notice the Bride come in view
[25:50] twice the first seed the second SE both
[25:54] of them exactly the same one and the
[25:57] reason they were dressed in different
[25:59] parts she'll come from All Nations it'll
[26:02] make up the
[26:04] bride each one had long hair and no
[26:06] makeup and real pretty girls and they
[26:08] were watching me that represented the
[26:10] bride coming out of all Nations see each
[26:13] one represent a nation as they March
[26:16] perfectly in line with the word see then
[26:19] I have to watch her she'll get out of
[26:20] Step of that word if I don't watch when
[26:22] she's passing by if she gets by maybe
[26:24] it'll be my time when I'm over see when
[26:27] I'm finished or what whatever it is
[26:28] watch they was getting back trying their
[26:30] best was getting back this getting the
[26:31] line is looking out somewhere else
[26:34] watching about that church and just went
[26:35] out of into chaos but two the front ones
[26:39] never the back ones just two or three of
[26:41] them was kind of stepped out a little
[26:43] bit to the right hand side it looked
[26:44] like was trying to get back in line as
[26:46] you went by as this passed me Old Forest
[26:48] here at the wall passed me I was
[26:50] standing there and then I just see all
[26:52] move out and leave but you notice the
[26:55] church only came into to view once each
[26:57] Nation
[26:58] the church but the Bride come in twice
[27:02] see see what it was now I'm not KN but
[27:04] look at with my message this morning not
[27:06] knowing that see the seed fell in the
[27:10] ground at NAA that was the original seed
[27:14] and she's come through the process of
[27:16] these denominations which only comes in
[27:18] existence once but the bride returns
[27:21] back again in the last days I will
[27:23] restore see the Masterpiece is brought
[27:26] up that's the reason she was in
[27:28] reviewed the second time she was
[27:30] reviewed the first time and she was
