[31:30] hallelujah thank you musicians we take
[31:33] our Bibles and go to Saint John chapter
[31:37] 5.
[31:38] it's in John chapter 5.
[31:40] [Music]
[31:43] it's in John chapter 5.
[31:49] that particular verse
[31:52] we spend almost a month on it
[31:55] but I want to take it tonight for
[31:59] for uh
[32:02] a part of our our type
[32:16] praise the Lord Saint John Chapter 5
[32:18] Verse 3 verse 19.
[32:20] between John chapter 5.
[32:24] I was not able to get to the hospital
[32:26] this afternoon because
[32:29] the loved one I was supposed to meet
[32:31] there I was not picking their phone and
[32:34] then they called back when it was when
[32:37] it was late so I just couldn't go and so
[32:44] as you make contact with them right
[32:46] after the service
[32:48] to see if we get down there but I talked
[32:51] to a thing is is a sister to the young
[32:54] man and uh
[32:56] he was having a kind of a high blood
[32:59] pressure
[33:01] you know I think he was somewhere over
[33:04] 200 or so or more and I think it shoot
[33:08] into his brain
[33:10] you know shoot into his brain and then I
[33:14] think it kind of for bringing out the
[33:17] the brain cells for communication
[33:19] so the doctors are not communicating
[33:22] with his brain
[33:24] you know even though he's he's showing
[33:28] signs of of opening his eyes but there
[33:32] is just no communication
[33:34] you know there is no communication so
[33:37] and that's that's one of the things that
[33:39] is difficult in medical science is they
[33:42] cannot communicate with your brain they
[33:43] don't know how to help your body
[33:46] you know they don't know how to help
[33:48] your body because it is that
[33:51] communication that tells them uh where
[33:54] they need to treat
[33:56] you know so it's it's a tough thing so
[34:00] they are they are leaving him uh you
[34:02] know in the hands of God's mercy
[34:05] you know they are leaving him in the
[34:07] hands of God's mercy so we will we will
[34:10] keep there
[34:12] in prayer
[34:14] I know there was a deacon brother in
[34:16] Liberia their brother uh Stephen wood
[34:19] brought a prayer request for he too was
[34:21] experiencing that that high blood
[34:24] pressure too and and they had to rush
[34:27] him over to the hospital and so uh it's
[34:31] uh it's a trench that we beginning to
[34:33] see that is happening among people
[34:35] whether it's because of stress or
[34:38] whatever it is and we want to make sure
[34:41] that we we take care of ourselves amen
[34:45] we have to realize that brother Branham
[34:48] says this age is the age of of letting
[34:51] off the pressure
[34:52] yes amen and this is a good way to let
[34:55] off the pressure to come in the presence
[34:57] of God Amen praise the Lord because we
[35:01] are we are living in a world where there
[35:04] are extreme pressure you know extreme
[35:06] pressure as the holy ghost live off of
[35:09] the earth I mean they are just they are
[35:12] just all sorts of things that is pulling
[35:14] into this three-dimensional world that
[35:16] we are living in so uh I mean let's
[35:20] let's guide ourself and and keep under
[35:22] the blood so John chapter 5 verse 19
[35:25] tonight
[35:28] then answer Jesus
[35:31] and said unto them verily verily I say
[35:35] unto you the son can do nothing of
[35:38] himself
[35:40] but what he serious the father do
[35:44] for one thing so ever he does
[35:48] also does the son likewise
[35:52] for the Father loveth the song and
[35:54] showeth him all things
[35:57] there himself does and he will show him
[36:00] greater work then this the year may
[36:05] Marvel let us pray Heavenly Father we
[36:08] just want to come to you Lord father
[36:10] approaching you by the reading of your
[36:13] word tonight and we will just ask Lord a
[36:16] special blessing upon the the community
[36:19] service tonight we just want to just our
[36:22] father take another type Lord in
[36:24] continuation of what we were talking
[36:26] about this morning and and father we
[36:29] will pray that God you will bless it to
[36:32] the heart of your people what an awesome
[36:34] God you are what a wonderful father in
[36:37] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[36:40] pray amen amen the Lord bless you
[36:43] praise the Lord
[36:47] praise the Lord you know what is one of
[36:49] these things where you are you
[36:54] you you are
[36:57] I remember I was over there uh on this
[37:00] trip that I was and I was speaking on
[37:02] something how you see in a day and age
[37:05] that we are living in and people says oh
[37:07] wow you know I mean it's just the love
[37:10] of God we just need to love one another
[37:11] we just need to love one another so uh
[37:15] uh you know uh sometimes when people
[37:19] have issues instead of dealing with the
[37:22] issues you know sitting down and dealing
[37:25] with the thing that is the problem they
[37:27] just says well we just need to love one
[37:29] another it's just the love of God you
[37:30] know you know God so loved the word and
[37:32] then it starts to preview the gospel of
[37:34] love
[37:36] and uh so I was I was I was speaking in
[37:39] one of the services there
[37:43] and I know I've looked into this before
[37:47] but then I went into that trench of
[37:49] talking about uh uh about that and I and
[37:52] I told the the Saints I says if you look
[37:56] at the early church
[37:58] the the emphasis of the early church and
[38:02] I'll give you I gave you an assignment
[38:03] to challenge you in the same way if you
[38:06] go and read the book of Arts
[38:10] from the first chapter to the last
[38:12] chapter the last verse
[38:15] strange enough
[38:18] strange enough
[38:19] the word love is never mentioned in that
[38:22] book
[38:29] I know some people won't sleep tonight
[38:34] I know some people will sleep tonight
[38:41] it's all it's all it's almost like the
[38:43] Book of Esther it
[38:45] okay
[38:46] you you know we we say that over and
[38:49] over you know that the name of God is
[38:51] never mentioned in the book but actually
[38:53] if you look at the Hebrew Monastery the
[38:55] name of God is there
[38:57] I'll take I'll take some time and bring
[38:59] that to you it's it's right it's right
[39:02] in uh it's it's hating just the word god
[39:05] G or the is not mentioned in the book
[39:07] and it's the same with the book of Acts
[39:10] now the Bible says they sell everything
[39:12] that they have and brought it to the
[39:14] apostles feet it must be love that
[39:16] constrain them to do that right amen the
[39:19] Bible says they were Distributing to the
[39:22] poor and helping you know the Saints the
[39:24] the poor it might be law the Bible talk
[39:26] about Dockers that was making blanket
[39:28] and giving it to to all uh you know the
[39:31] people until when she died everybody
[39:33] remembered that it was the love of God
[39:35] that was on her heart so don't
[39:37] misunderstand me that love was not in
[39:39] the book of Arts
[39:41] it's just that the worst spell out was
[39:44] never used in the text why because the
[39:47] emphasis was not on the the feelings of
[39:52] the people the emphasis was on the life
[39:55] projected The Life of Christ reaching
[39:58] out
[40:01] foreign
[40:04] forces of the early church the emphasis
[40:07] of these people have just witnessed the
[40:10] death and the burial and the
[40:12] resurrection of Jesus
[40:15] they have just experienced a baptism of
[40:18] the Holy Ghost
[40:19] the pillar of Fire coming down in the
[40:22] upper room and baptized and giving every
[40:25] one of them
[40:27] an experience that they have never had
[40:30] in their life since they were born
[40:36] so their emphasis was not well you just
[40:39] love me or we we just need to laugh no
[40:42] their emphasis was not in a sense of
[40:45] looking for human sympathy or trying to
[40:47] sympathize with people they are emphasis
[40:50] they believe in a resurrected Christ
[40:55] they believe in a living God
[40:58] you know so I was I was uh I was I was
[41:02] talking on this
[41:05] and then after this after the service
[41:09] I was I was relaxing
[41:11] and I says well I think I need to look
[41:13] at my challenge let me go back
[41:16] let me go back before because I've
[41:19] thrown out challenge and I've come back
[41:21] in and encouraged myself and say I'm
[41:23] wrong I'm you know I'm guilty
[41:25] so I went back and and kind of look at
[41:28] that in and I realized yeah now for once
[41:31] the word was used in the book of Acts
[41:33] but you do the same if you finally let
[41:34] me know in that way you can help me
[41:39] it's the same it's the same also of uh
[41:42] of Revelation chapter 10 that we read
[41:47] praise the Lord
[41:50] if the emphasis
[41:52] of the early church was not on
[41:57] sympathizing with people or appealing
[42:00] for sympathy those people wanted to
[42:03] experience
[42:04] they wanted to experience the new life
[42:10] they wanted to experience just imagine
[42:12] those people they had a hope in their
[42:15] heart that the Messiah was going to
[42:18] bring them a Jewish ruling in Israel
[42:22] he was going to stem out the Romans
[42:26] that was why they had in their heart so
[42:29] they were looking for someone that would
[42:31] bring a revolution against the Romans
[42:36] praise the Lord
[42:37] but Jesus brought them a new birth
[42:42] he brought him an Exeter bringing them
[42:45] out of Judaism
[42:49] and bringing them to
[42:53] the knee birth
[42:55] bringing him to an experience bringing
[42:57] him to a kingdom they were looking for
[42:59] the kingdom of David on Earth but he was
[43:02] bringing the kingdom to their heart
[43:06] and after the resurrection of Jesus they
[43:09] were all desperate they were only atours
[43:12] when they get down to pray they wanted
[43:14] an answer
[43:20] because this man that he saw that raised
[43:22] the dead and healed the sake they saw
[43:25] him being crucified on the cross
[43:28] they witnessed them taking his body down
[43:31] and laying him in a tomb
[43:34] and then before three days his
[43:36] resurrected he comes stepping through
[43:37] the wall and spreading your hands and
[43:39] said Put Your Hands here see the nails
[43:42] I'm alive
[43:48] so the the early church they were not
[43:50] looking for sympathy
[43:52] they were now looking for sympathy when
[43:54] when Peter and John were arrested they
[43:57] never had to choose their words they
[43:59] never had to be politically correct
[44:03] they said well we we learn to obey men
[44:06] or obey God
[44:11] praise the Lord
[44:15] they were desperate to see a living God
[44:18] among among them the Bible says that God
[44:20] together to pray until the house was
[44:23] shaken
[44:25] I don't believe that it was it was a
[44:28] physical shaking of the house but they
[44:30] broke into a spear they broke into an
[44:33] atmosphere
[44:39] they were not looking for him on
[44:40] sympathy
[44:41] they were not looking for oh oh yeah
[44:43] yeah everybody don't like me nobody like
[44:46] me nobody loved me nobody called me
[44:48] nobody oh my God
[44:52] we will not have a book of Arts if that
[44:54] was their attitude
[45:02] praise the Lord
[45:03] as chapter 5 when he got right down
[45:06] there Peter did not choose his words
[45:10] praise the Lord
[45:14] I was just looking at that I was
[45:16] standing on the subject called Acts
[45:17] chapter 5 return back to the church I
[45:19] realized that brother Branham uh uh uh
[45:22] through the message he he Associated
[45:25] Acts chapter 5 with the gift of
[45:27] discernment
[45:31] the same gift that was knowing the
[45:34] secret in people's heart
[45:36] brother Branham says it was the same
[45:38] manifestation that took place in Acts
[45:41] chapter 5.
[45:45] so ananias and Sophia came to church and
[45:48] just like brother Branham would say you
[45:50] set him back there with that thing in
[45:52] your heart that was exactly what he did
[45:55] yeah
[45:57] say you down there what what are you
[46:00] lying to the Holy Ghost
[46:05] through
[46:07] the spirit of discernment back in the
[46:09] church
[46:11] when Simon the Sorcerer thought that he
[46:14] can bribe and and you know he has he has
[46:17] he has lived this way
[46:21] praise the Lord
[46:23] amen
[46:25] he had lived by his magic tricks and all
[46:28] of that he has make name for himself
[46:32] and now when he heard that the the the
[46:34] the apostles and and what they were
[46:37] doing he was trying to associate himself
[46:40] with them so he cannot lose his status
[46:42] because pretty soon the Holy Ghost was
[46:44] going to expose him
[46:49] in which of course the Holy Ghost
[46:50] exposing
[46:53] praise the Lord
[46:54] so you see the early church they were
[46:57] not they were not on he must sympathy to
[46:59] to build their Church
[47:02] the Bible says it was just one move of
[47:04] God three thousand people added to the
[47:06] church
[47:08] and the prophet of God said that's where
[47:09] they had their problem because there was
[47:11] a mixed multitude that came in men that
[47:14] creeped in unaware to spy the liberty of
[47:17] the church
[47:20] so let's get away from this thing of
[47:22] appealing for sympathy
[47:28] right appealing for sympathy the
[47:30] attitude of the early church was to see
[47:32] the resurrected Christ
[47:38] see the resurrected Christ moving in
[47:40] your corner you won't care if anybody
[47:42] call you on that because you know Jesus
[47:45] said I will never leave you I will never
[47:47] forsake you you know that resurrected
[47:49] crisis with you
[47:57] are we together
[48:00] now so what what I wanted to do uh this
[48:04] evening was just to to just uh take
[48:07] another portion of my types
[48:09] we uh we went through this uh uh
[48:15] we went through this
[48:18] this uh this subject
[48:21] when we were talking on Harmony
[48:24] the the the the we were talking on
[48:28] the harmony between the father and the
[48:31] son
[48:32] I mean we we deal with this for almost a
[48:35] month if it is now more than that
[48:37] brother Brandon Pagano's Church age
[48:39] notice the harmony of the father and the
[48:42] son Jesus never did anything until it
[48:46] was first shown him by the father
[48:49] John 5 19 he said this harmony
[48:53] is known to exist between the groom and
[48:57] his bride
[48:59] he show her his word
[49:02] his Word of Life she receive it she
[49:05] never doubt it therefore nothing can
[49:08] harm her
[49:09] not even death amen death only promote
[49:13] her
[49:14] death do not harm her amen it promote us
[49:17] it sent us to a a higher dimension for
[49:21] if the seed is planted and what and uh
[49:25] and water will rise it up again here is
[49:29] the secret of this the word is in the
[49:32] bride as it was in Mary the bride has
[49:36] the mind of Christ
[49:38] for she knows what he once done with the
[49:43] word
[49:44] praise the Lord
[49:46] amen all that was saying God he
[49:48] committed to Christ he put it in Christ
[49:51] all that was in Christ he pulls in the
[49:54] church so the the the the bride has the
[49:57] man of Christ and she knows what
[50:01] he won the word to be done with amen
[50:06] now so
[50:08] we would take that that type tonight and
[50:12] goes to first king
[50:14] first king chapter 2.
[50:20] first king chapter 2.
[50:25] are we together
[50:29] first king chapter two
[50:33] first before we read first king chapter
[50:36] two let me back up with the story here
[50:39] before we read first king chapter two if
[50:42] you look in second Samuel chapter 16
[50:46] you will see the story of where David
[50:50] when he was rejected
[50:52] when Absalom his son has has taken the
[50:57] throne and David was rejected we come
[51:00] across this story in the second king
[51:02] chapter two from uh uh no chap second
[51:07] king chapter 16 sorry
[51:09] second king chapter 16. and it is the
[51:13] story word David is now living the city
[51:17] as a rejected King and we see this
[51:21] benjamined
[51:23] ah
[51:24] [Music]
[51:28] let's let me read from verse five and
[51:31] when and when King David came to bahura
[51:35] and behold thence came out a man of the
[51:39] family of the House of Saul who name was
[51:43] their son of jira he came forth
[51:47] and
[51:48] and cursed
[51:52] still as he came cursing David and he
[51:56] cast on a David and and at all the seven
[52:00] of King David
[52:02] and all the people
[52:06] and all the mighty men were on his right
[52:10] hand and on his left am I reading second
[52:13] Samuel 16. reading from verse 5.
[52:17] if I did not confuse you
[52:20] okay
[52:25] so I'm reading from second Samuel
[52:29] chapter 16
[52:31] from verse 5. amen
[52:33] so I'm down to verse seven and thus say
[52:37] when he cares come out come out
[52:40] thou bloody man and thou men of belie
[52:44] the Lord has returned upon thee all the
[52:48] blood of the House of Saul in who still
[52:51] there there has Reign and the Lord has
[52:54] delivered the kingdom into the hands of
[52:58] Absalon thy son and behold thou I take
[53:02] him in thy Mischief because thou are a
[53:06] bloody man praise the Lord and as You
[53:08] Follow the story that was word David man
[53:12] says I will not allow this dog to cause
[53:15] my king he wanted to use the spear
[53:18] Davidson or leave him
[53:20] maybe the Lord has told him to do that
[53:23] amen
[53:25] maybe in bearing this I might be able to
[53:28] find Mercy before God
[53:31] praise the Lord
[53:32] in bearing this I might be able to find
[53:37] Mercy before God Christ is the mission
[53:39] of God revealed brother bam talks about
[53:41] a story with he and brother Neville you
[53:44] know and he says he says Branham why why
[53:48] were you just you just sit down there
[53:50] and allow people to just say things
[53:52] about you without without reacting he
[53:55] says he said there he said but Olivia
[53:57] was a man that was very quick on the
[53:59] trigger amen he gets back you fire him
[54:03] he fired back at you you know and then
[54:05] brother Brandon referred to this
[54:07] scripture and uh just at that time
[54:10] brother Brown was was was praying about
[54:12] something and uh and then he said he
[54:15] said brother nivo you remember in the
[54:17] story in the Bible where David allowed
[54:20] you know she mailed to curse him and
[54:23] then uh he you know he just he just
[54:26] allowed it to go and uh and and just in
[54:30] having that attitude you know right
[54:33] after that conversation the prophet
[54:35] broke into a vision and then he have he
[54:39] had an answer of something that he was
[54:40] waiting for now so you see yeah uh it's
[54:43] a great principle now so this this took
[54:46] place
[54:47] this took place shimaya has has cursed
[54:50] David to the face and uh you know and
[54:53] then he's he's gone now let's go over to
[54:57] our
[54:59] chapter that we wanted to read
[55:03] which is uh
[55:07] first Samuel chapter two no
[55:10] first king
[55:11] chapter two
[55:15] first king chapter two
[55:24] I think you might have an idea when I'm
[55:27] going with this but uh
[55:32] just bear with me now the days of David
[55:36] Drew 9 that he should die and he charged
[55:40] Solomon his son saying I go the way of
[55:45] all the Earth be thou strong therefore
[55:48] and show thyself a man
[55:52] and keep the charge of the Lord thy God
[55:55] to walk in his ways to keep his statures
[55:59] and his Commandments and his joshmen and
[56:03] his testimonies
[56:04] as it is written in the Lord of Moses
[56:07] that thou mayor prosper in all that they
[56:12] are thus and whether so ever that
[56:15] turneth thyself
[56:17] that the law may continue on his words
[56:20] which he speak concerning means saying
[56:23] if that children take heed to their ways
[56:26] to walk before me in truth
[56:29] with all their heart and with all they
[56:33] are so there shall not fail thee he said
[56:37] a man on the throne of Israel
[56:40] praise the Lord
[56:42] now as David
[56:45] tried to instruct Solomon here
[56:48] he says you know take charge to yourself
[56:51] do all of this
[56:53] and you know walk in the Commandments of
[56:57] the Lord don't turn from the a to the
[56:58] right don't turn from it to the left now
[57:01] we will see him moving into something as
[57:04] verse 5
[57:08] moreover they'll know it show up now
[57:11] joab was David captain of the army
[57:15] praise the Lord
[57:17] he's going to give Solomon an
[57:19] instruction because there were two
[57:21] captains that job killed when Absalom
[57:25] was the king
[57:26] uh uh what is his name Abner
[57:31] was uh the captain of the army of of
[57:36] Absalom draw up make sure that abna was
[57:41] that you know was killed in battle and
[57:45] then uh Amisa also
[57:47] so David here now is reminding Solomon
[57:51] now refer back now to Saint John 5 19
[57:55] okay
[57:56] uh David yeah is re uh uh reminding
[58:01] Solomon
[58:03] that uh
[58:06] Joe up did this to me
[58:09] you know he killed this Army and uh
[58:16] and he says
[58:19] verse 6 do therefore I call into that
[58:22] wisdom and let net his hurt head go down
[58:27] to the grave in peace
[58:29] praise the Lord
[58:32] over in verse 9
[58:34] verse 8 David is also picking up another
[58:38] case
[58:40] and that would be the case of shimir
[58:45] but what is beautiful here is that uh
[58:49] before we get to this place
[58:51] when uh David returned back to the
[58:55] kingdom
[58:57] has come to ask David for pardon
[59:02] and David have given him an instruction
[59:06] praise the Lord
[59:09] he promised she mailed if you read the
[59:13] story
[59:14] he swore unto him
[59:17] he swore unto him that he will not kill
[59:20] him
[59:24] but
[59:25] David never put an all to it
[59:33] just like David
[59:35] swear I saw make David to swear unto him
[59:40] that he will remember him in all of his
[59:42] sons
[59:43] David accepted it but David never put an
[59:46] ought to it
[59:50] praise the Lord so if you continue in a
[59:54] line of talk that we were that we were
[59:56] speaking on this morning if there is not
[59:59] an art
[1:00:00] there is a possibility for the promise
[1:00:04] to be broken
[1:00:11] praise the Lord
[1:00:12] is only
[1:00:14] now if you go back to Hebrew chapter 6
[1:00:18] you'll realize that uh when when uh when
[1:00:22] Paul speaks about that
[1:00:24] how gods were by himself
[1:00:27] Paul used there to be able to introduce
[1:00:32] the mechevelop priesthood
[1:00:35] then he goes into it in chapter seven
[1:00:37] and on and on and on
[1:00:40] now you will realize that when God
[1:00:45] gave uh uh Finnish
[1:00:49] and and and a promise that he will be a
[1:00:53] priest forever
[1:00:56] there was no artwork
[1:01:01] praise the Lord
[1:01:02] because if you read
[1:01:05] uh through the history of Israel you
[1:01:08] will realize that in the time of Solomon
[1:01:14] the one that from the lineage of Philly
[1:01:17] has that was priests
[1:01:21] was compromised
[1:01:26] so if God promised the priests who
[1:01:29] forever
[1:01:32] until Fini has there was a place where
[1:01:35] it came to an end
[1:01:37] why because there was no art
[1:01:41] to the levitical priesthood
[1:01:43] God never put an alter it
[1:01:51] why because there was
[1:01:55] a priesthood
[1:01:57] that is an internal priesthood
[1:02:03] the priests who after the other
[1:02:06] of magazinek
[1:02:10] it's such a beautiful story when you
[1:02:12] just take the time and look through the
[1:02:14] scripture
[1:02:16] over in the time of of of of David
[1:02:21] uh zadac also was brought into the
[1:02:25] priesthood
[1:02:26] and uh that that priesthood in his
[1:02:30] lineage
[1:02:32] continue on to the coming of the Messiah
[1:02:38] praise the Lord
[1:02:41] and also if you read the book of Ezekiel
[1:02:43] you will realize that God promised the
[1:02:47] priesthood
[1:02:48] from the family of Zara to be over in a
[1:02:52] millennium now you will see why in
[1:02:54] marriage and divorce when brother
[1:02:56] Branham was referring to things from the
[1:02:58] levitical priesthood He also mentioned
[1:03:01] Ezekiel
[1:03:04] praise the Lord that is just something
[1:03:07] completely different but let's come over
[1:03:09] here to what we were talking about uh
[1:03:13] uh uh this David and this young
[1:03:16] gentleman so David you know what uh uh
[1:03:19] make make a swear unto him
[1:03:22] that he was not going to kill him
[1:03:24] but here is David here at a time where
[1:03:27] he's about to leave he's telling his son
[1:03:31] remember him
[1:03:34] the son of jira a benjamite
[1:03:37] of bahuram which cursed me
[1:03:40] with a grievous curse in the day when I
[1:03:43] went
[1:03:44] to uh
[1:03:46] mahina but he came down and met me at
[1:03:50] Jordan and I swear to him by the law
[1:03:53] saying I will not put thee to death
[1:03:56] with the sword
[1:03:58] now therefore
[1:04:00] hold him not Guiltless
[1:04:05] praise the Lord
[1:04:07] so that that that's where the principle
[1:04:10] is that's that's what uh you know what
[1:04:13] we we I I want you to see because you
[1:04:16] know brother Branham in a message
[1:04:18] marriage and divorce he speaks of the
[1:04:20] continuity of the scripture
[1:04:24] even in the light of the types
[1:04:27] there is a place where a type holds in
[1:04:31] the life of Joseph he was a perfect type
[1:04:35] of Jesus Christ but when it came to the
[1:04:38] place of where he's telling lies that
[1:04:40] type breaks
[1:04:43] he he's not representing Jesus in that
[1:04:47] praise the Lord David was a perfect type
[1:04:51] of Jesus Christ you know crying or going
[1:04:54] up the hill you know and all of that but
[1:04:56] when the king told his transgression
[1:04:59] with Bathsheba the tie breaks
[1:05:05] praise the Lord
[1:05:07] amen because when we just take these
[1:05:11] thoughts of times and things in the
[1:05:14] scripture and don't know where it holds
[1:05:17] and where it breaks then brother Branham
[1:05:19] said pray the song we have a house on
[1:05:21] top of the house eating grass
[1:05:23] right you have the picture completely
[1:05:26] out of other
[1:05:28] here is David swearing to this man that
[1:05:31] he will not kill him
[1:05:33] but what what happened here now that
[1:05:36] he's instructing his son uh uh uh
[1:05:39] Solomon
[1:05:41] to use wisdom and deal with this why
[1:05:44] because there was no art to it
[1:05:48] there was no art to it
[1:05:50] where David had an odd was to janiton in
[1:05:54] his sons
[1:05:56] right
[1:05:58] he did not have he did not have an ought
[1:06:01] to to saw
[1:06:04] when he promised and swear unto him he
[1:06:07] did not had an heart out here also to
[1:06:10] Toshiba
[1:06:12] so Solomon is instructing him
[1:06:15] instructing his son like Jesus says the
[1:06:18] father committed all judgment to the son
[1:06:22] so that is the time here David is
[1:06:24] committing all judgment to his son
[1:06:29] are we together
[1:06:31] then when Solomon came to power we see
[1:06:35] here that uh Solomon sent for him
[1:06:40] and Solomon instructed him
[1:06:42] and said
[1:06:44] you remember all that you have you have
[1:06:47] done uh unto my father
[1:06:54] he told him
[1:06:56] that
[1:06:58] don't go out of the city of Jerusalem
[1:07:05] praise the Lord
[1:07:07] so you see what he's doing is the other
[1:07:09] he's keeping the promise he made to his
[1:07:13] father he's Reviving The the uh the the
[1:07:17] Covenant if you call it he's Reviving
[1:07:20] The Covenant he's putting a condition to
[1:07:23] the Covenant
[1:07:24] because when God makes an ought
[1:07:28] you are on an unconditional coveting
[1:07:31] no matter what you do God cannot break
[1:07:34] it right
[1:07:36] praise the Lord amen
[1:07:39] when God swore by himself and put an all
[1:07:43] to it is unconditional God hold himself
[1:07:46] responsible
[1:07:49] but if there is no ought to it then it
[1:07:52] becomes a conditional Covenant
[1:07:58] so yeah Solomon is giving
[1:08:01] a condition
[1:08:04] he's Reviving The Promise of David I
[1:08:07] would like I swear I will not kill you
[1:08:09] but yes the condition you got to stay in
[1:08:11] the walls of Jerusalem
[1:08:19] praise the Lord
[1:08:21] are we together
[1:08:28] and when you read
[1:08:30] uh the rest of the story
[1:08:33] you'll find out that uh
[1:08:36] uh shimia
[1:08:38] had a problem with one of his seven
[1:08:41] and the Seven was running out of the
[1:08:43] city of Jerusalem and he forgot
[1:08:46] and God on the terror and ran out of the
[1:08:49] city and when Solomon found out
[1:08:53] he broke the Covenant
[1:08:56] so then Solomon
[1:08:58] executed him
[1:09:02] so you see the place of the scripture
[1:09:04] you see those things are they are placed
[1:09:08] there like like Paul said for our
[1:09:10] examples
[1:09:15] a lot of those types and shadows are
[1:09:18] placed right in there for our examples
[1:09:25] praise the Lord
[1:09:32] so when God
[1:09:34] make an art
[1:09:36] when God make an order after the service
[1:09:39] this morning there were there was
[1:09:41] something the other that I was looking
[1:09:44] at
[1:09:45] when I read Revelation chapter 10 and I
[1:09:49] just I just believed that was the grace
[1:09:50] of God I did not have that in my notes
[1:09:52] like that but uh I mean the spirit of
[1:09:55] the Lord led me that way so I went back
[1:09:58] and then I started reading
[1:10:00] and I was and I was looking at uh uh the
[1:10:05] way the the way that uh you know the the
[1:10:08] entire chapter was it was designed with
[1:10:12] all the conjunctions
[1:10:14] that is in the the scripture
[1:10:20] and then I realized that end is just a
[1:10:24] conjunction as but
[1:10:28] but the difference there is their end is
[1:10:31] a conjunction of continuation
[1:10:36] but what is a conjunction of a contracts
[1:10:43] praise the Lord
[1:10:44] so that they're just
[1:10:47] it just kind of for
[1:10:50] it just kind of Fosters something you
[1:10:52] mean and and I think the law kind of
[1:10:54] forgive me strength from there praise
[1:10:56] the Lord amen
[1:10:58] so you see uh
[1:11:03] that's the reason why that gods were by
[1:11:05] himself
[1:11:07] he has brought us honor
[1:11:10] and ought
[1:11:12] of an unconditional coveting
[1:11:16] praise the Lord
[1:11:20] there is nothing
[1:11:21] there he's looking up to us to do but to
[1:11:26] accept all that he have provided
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:31] so just like when we come to the
[1:11:34] communion tonight
[1:11:36] as we are here
[1:11:38] a few minutes will be changing the order
[1:11:40] of the service this is this is an
[1:11:42] instruction of God's word
[1:11:45] praise the Lord
[1:11:48] it's an instruction of God's word and
[1:11:50] like we read this morning
[1:11:52] bird branches as we approach the table
[1:11:54] I'm saying to my brothers and sisters
[1:11:57] and says I believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:59] I believe all he have done for me to the
[1:12:02] best of my knowledge I'm living a
[1:12:04] Christian Life
[1:12:06] praise the Lord
[1:12:08] I'm living a Christian Life I'm not
[1:12:10] living a life of of uh of impression
[1:12:14] I'm not living a life of our service
[1:12:20] I'm serving God
[1:12:23] with the earnesty of my heart
[1:12:25] praise the Lord
[1:12:27] amen if there is anything that that uh
[1:12:31] that you know a way that I'm stepping
[1:12:34] wrong if God made it noon to me I'm
[1:12:36] going to make it right
[1:12:43] praise the Lord
[1:12:44] you see how much pressure that that
[1:12:47] takes from over us we are not we are not
[1:12:49] uh uh trying to live to the expectation
[1:12:53] of one another or the impression of one
[1:12:55] another
[1:12:57] go
[1:12:58] that was what Saul was trying to do when
[1:13:01] he killed the giver Knights
[1:13:03] and they caught seven of his sons
[1:13:09] praise the Lord
[1:13:11] like I said before and uh and there is
[1:13:14] there's a reason why I'm continuing
[1:13:16] making this statement as I said before
[1:13:19] the only thing we have as we as we said
[1:13:22] before the Lord is the faith in Jesus
[1:13:25] Christ that we have in our hearts
[1:13:27] and Grace that is taking us day by day
[1:13:31] to live for him
[1:13:34] if God should take that Grace away from
[1:13:36] us we will be no different than the
[1:13:38] people in the world
[1:13:41] and if there is anything that we must
[1:13:43] appreciate
[1:13:45] and always keep to the back of our mind
[1:13:47] that it's a finished work we are looking
[1:13:49] at a finished work
[1:13:58] let's bow our heads this evening
[1:14:10] foreign
[1:14:19] we want to create our own
[1:14:23] self-righteous approach to God
[1:14:27] and we want people to conform to our our
[1:14:32] mind of what we think it is instead of
[1:14:37] praying for one another provoking one
[1:14:40] another to Godly love
[1:14:42] and Sheltering our differences if there
[1:14:45] is any walking by faith trusting the
[1:14:49] grace of God
[1:14:51] put in the name of God first in our life
[1:14:54] and things that we do
[1:14:56] if we if we if we are escaping from
[1:14:59] there then we are putting ourselves on a
[1:15:01] condition of covenanting and every
[1:15:03] conditional Covenant will be broken
[1:15:07] because that's that's that was not the
[1:15:10] Covenant that God gave to Abraham
[1:15:13] when God will institute the element of
[1:15:17] faith
[1:15:18] to his people
[1:15:21] he would bring Abraham
[1:15:24] in an unconditional Covenant
[1:15:38] as we buy our house tonight
