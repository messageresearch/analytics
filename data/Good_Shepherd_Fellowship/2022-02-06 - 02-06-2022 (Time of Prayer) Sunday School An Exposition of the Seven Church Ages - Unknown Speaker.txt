========================================

[Music] so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] was the sole criterion thus he was against works as a means of salvation and baptism as a means of regeneration he taught the mediation of christ apart from man as was the original and pentecostal concept he was a man given to much prayer and had learned that the more work he had to do and the more sorely he was pressed for time the more of his time he gave to god in prayer in order to ensure satisfactory results he knew what it was to battle with the devil and it is said that satan one day visibly appeared to him and he flung the ink well at him bidding him go another time two fanatics came to him to induce him to join with them in banishing all priests and bibles he discerned the spirit within them and sent them off it is recorded of dr martin luther in sauer's history volume 3 page 406 that he was a prophet evangelist speaker in tongues interpreter in one person endowed with all nine gifts of the spirit what stirred his heart by the holy ghost and which was the little green shoot that signified that truth was coming back to the church as it was known at pentecost was the doctrine of justification salvation by grace apart from works i recognize that dr luther did not believe only and preach only justification but that was his major theme as indeed it had to be for that is the basic doctrine of the truth of the word he will be forever known as the instrument in the hand of god who revived this truth he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith surely we admit that he knew and did teach that we are to go from faith to faith his marvelous understanding of sovereignty election predestination and other truths show him to be a great man in the word yet i say again as do historians god used him to bring to the people god's standard against works the just shall live by faith now as i mentioned already this age has been called by the historians the period of reformation that is exactly right that is what it was it had to be that for martin luther was a reformer not a prophet now i know the history book calls him a prophet but it doesn't mean that the history book is right for there is no record of martin luther qualifying as a true prophet of god in the grand scriptural sense of that word he was a fine teacher with some of the manifestations of the spirit in his life and we praise god for that so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like the apostle paul who was both apostle and prophet now as time went on we find a great change in the way he conducted the affairs in which he was involved at first he had been so gentle so fearless so patient and constantly waiting on god to work out the problems but then vast numbers began to come to his banner their purpose was not a truly spiritual one rather they had political motivations they wanted to break the yoke of the pope they disliked sending money to rome fanatics rose up soon he was dragged into political affairs and decisions that actually lay outside the realm of the church except that the church through prayer preaching and conduct might set up a standard to be heated these problems of politics mounted until he was forced into an untenable position of mediating between lords and peasants his decisions were so wrong that an uprising took place and thousands were killed he meant well but once he had let himself be entangled again in a church state gospel he had to reap the whirlwind but for all that god used martin luther let it not be said that his intentions were wrong let it only be said that his judgment failed truly if the lutherans could get back to his teaching and serve god as this gracious brother served him then that people would surely be a credit and praise to the great god and savior jesus christ the salutation revelation 3 1 these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars once again as in the previous four ages the spirit is revealing our gracious lord to us by setting forth his wonderful attributes this time as he is standing in the midst of the church we see him as the one with the seven spirits of god and the seven stars we know who the seven stars are but we will have to find what the seven spirits refer to this same phrase is found four times in the book of revelation revelation 1 4. from the seven spirits which are before his throne revelation 3 1 these things saith he that hath the seven spirits revelation 4 5 and out of the throne proceedeth lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god revelation 5 6 and i beheld and blow in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth to begin with we know for a certainty that these verses are not teaching a new and contrary doctrine to john 4 24 a god is a one spirit but this is like first corinthians 12 8 through 11 wherein we find one spirit manifesting himself in nine ways thus we know that the seven spirits of god mean it is the one and same spirit coming forth in a seven-fold way now in revelation four five these same seven spirits are called lamps of fire burning before the lord since john always used nothing but old testament symbols in the revelation we go to the old testament and find from proverbs 20 27 that the spirit of man is the lamp of the lord these seven spirits are found to be associated with man john the baptist in john 5 35 was called a burning light which should actually be translated as burning lamp again in revelation 5 6 the seven spirits are identified as seven eyes in zechariah 4 10 for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the lord it is very evident that the word they refers to men thus we see that the eyes of the lord in this instance are men of course they will be anointed men full of the holy ghost for god's ministries are not in the power of men but of the holy ghost putting our scriptural discoveries together it is evident that the seven spirits of god refer to the continuous ministry of the same holy spirit in the lives of seven men with whom god identifies himself very closely they are his eyes and they are his lamps who these seven men are can easily be seen because the next phrase calls them the seven stars which are already known to us as the seven messengers to the seven ages how beautiful that is see the star was meant to reflect light at night for the sun has gone just so the messenger typified as a star to each age was to reflect the light of the sun they all did this by the holy spirit paul was the first messenger and he said in galatians 1 8 that if any angel any messenger any vicar no matter who he was if he preached any other gospel than what paul preached let him be accursed paul knew that after he was gone grievous wolves would come in he knew that satan himself could appear as an angel of light so how much more his ministers so he warns that this gospel would always be the same now paul had baptized in jesus name and rebaptized where people had not been so immersed he set the church in order and taught the proper use of the gifts of the spirit and confirmed that they were to remain in the church till jesus came thus the next messengers all the remaining six would by the same holy ghost burn with the same fire and give the same light of the gospel of jesus christ and the signs would follow them did irony is qualify yes did martin yes did columba yes did martin luther most assuredly did wesley yes sir he had a great ministry and even prayed for his horse to get well and it did there you are seven church ages and seven messengers who were alike and paul pronounced a curse on anyone who said he was a messenger but had a different gospel and lived in a different light now does that last statement of mind bear up with the rest of the word yes it says in the word that if any man adds to this book or takes from it he would be plagued and judged unto condemnation by god god said i will add the plagues written in this book or i will take his part out of the book of life revelation 22 18 so we see that the seven spirits actually refer to the one spirit of god working out the will and word of god in different generations i would like to illustrate that from the word the spirit of god was mightily upon elijah then that same spirit came upon elisha in a two-fold effect then centuries later the same spirit which we call the spirit of elijah in order to describe its ministry came back upon john the baptist one day that same spirit identified by the same manner of ministry will come upon a man for the end of the gentile church age again the scripture says that god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and power and he went about doing good healing all that were oppressed of the devil as jesus went away he told his disciples to tarry until pentecost at which time the very same spirit that was upon him would come back and fall upon them and fill them then that called out body the church would be in his stead upon the earth taking his place and because that same spirit that was in him would be in them they would do the very same works and any people that is truly the body of jesus christ the true church will manifest the same works as did jesus and the pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them any other church that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to have to account to god it also says here that these seven stars or seven messengers to the seven ages are in his hand he is holding them you know right away that if they are held in his hand they are associated with his power that is what the hand signifies it signifies the power of god and authority of god not one of them came in his own power and authority that is what paul said no man would dare to it takes the authority of god and the power of the holy ghost the gospel is preached by the authority of god in the power of the spirit these men were all empowered by the holy ghost they all stood up to the world they could do that they were full of god they were sent or authorized by god not by self or other men now they had what the world could not have jesus said that when he went away he would send his spirit which the world could not receive that is right the world or world systems could not receive him that is what organization is it is world system show me a world system church that is full of the holy ghost i want to see it if you can show me such a church you are finding a mistake in the word no sir not one of these messengers was organized either they were put out or got out because they were convicted of the sin of organization how can the holy spirit possibly be an organization when it is organization that takes the place of the spirit and denominations take the place of the word remember organization is death it just can't be any other way if the world takes over the spirit departs yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same and the seven messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at pentecost by experience it will be a pentecostal church and there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecy and healings god will be in the midst of her and god will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has hallelujah and she will be unorganized don't forget that now we can see that jesus christ is revealing himself through the ages by his spirit in the messengers they are as moses was to the children of israel as he had the revelation for his day so each messenger had god's revelation and ministry for that day thus when we see that the messengers are in his hand we see the lord identifying himself with these men and granting them his power it is not enough that he has associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he was seen standing amongst the seven golden lampstands nor is it even enough that we see the five-fold ministry of ephesians four apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors for in each age the church goes astray and it is not just the laity but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as sheep then god brings himself on the scene as the chief shepherd in the ministries of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the abundant power of that truth god is in his people all of his people for if any man has not the spirit of christ he is none of his and he is the word that would be the word recognized in the people but he has placed a special leadership in these men of his own choosing and through the determined counsel of his own will they appear once in each age it is the same spirit in them what a far cry is this from the heresy of rome they have a man of their own choosing one after the other none producing the power of god none abiding in the word of god each one differing from the one before him and adding what he desires as though he were god god is not in it but he is in his messenger and he who would have the fullness of god would follow the messenger as the messenger is a follower of the lord by his word he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars revelation 3 1 as this same lord identified himself with man in the incarnation he is again identifying himself with man by his spirit within man these are mine saith the lord the seven spirit-filled messengers are the lords they may be repudiated they may be questioned indeed to human minds they may not even seem to qualify nevertheless they are the messengers for their age god used an abraham he lied he used a moses he rebelled a jonah he disobeyed a samson he sinned a david he murdered he also used a joshua and a joseph and those with severe blemishes far outnumber those whose histories seem to be perfect all were and are his none dare deny that he used them by and through the holy spirit that he put within them to their own master they stood or fell and in them always accomplished the sovereign will of god let external history attempt to refute this it still stands the eternal god still walks amongst the golden lamp stands and sends his messengers by his spirit with the word to the people of every age the denunciation revelation three one be i know thy works that thou has a name that thou livest and art dead revelation 3 2 be for i have not found thy works perfect before god now here indeed is a very strange thing in every age to this point the spirit has first of all praised the true believers and then denounced the false vine but in this period there is evidently such want and disregard for the lord and his word that the entire message to this fifth age rings with condemnation i know thy works what were these works that came up before the lord and caused his displeasure well you know that each age lapped over into the next age so we have a continuation of the works of the fourth age into the fifth these works as you are well aware were one the leadership of the holy spirit was superseded by a human hierarchy two the pure word of god and its free benefit to all men was deposed for creeds dogmas church orders etc three the worship in the spirit and gifts of the spirit and all that which pertains to true community fellowship of the saints was cast aside for liturgy and literal idol worship pagan feasts etc four mary olitree was assuming a greater place in the christian worship until she had actually assumed a place of godhead and the son was brought from his lofty position of over all to being subservient to a man called the pope who termed himself the vicar of christ those who fought this terrible antichrist church were destroyed those who stayed with it found themselves the pawn of the church whether they be peasants or kings their lives were not their own and neither were their lives christ's but they belonged body soul and spirit to the church of rome they talked about the blood of christ yet they purchased their salvation with money and bought forgiveness of sins either by gold or penance the wealthier of them founded a happy situation when pope leo the tenth allowed them to buy indulgences for sins not yet committed so that they with ease of conscience could plan their awful crimes and then proceed to carry them out knowing that the pope had already remitted their sins the word of god was kept from them so who was to know the truth since truth comes only from the word the people were shut up in a dungeon of the roman church awaiting death and after death the judgment but the great drunk with the blood of martyrs and with no thought of the judgment reeled savagely on to kill men with both spiritual and physical death now toward the end of the fourth age which would be the beginning of the fifth age also the invasion of constantinople by the turks sent the learned scholars of the east with their greek manuscripts to the west the purity of the word and the teachings of true believers were thus disseminated and not only were these fine teachers of great importance but also the invention of what became the basis of our modern printing presses was discovered facilitating the production of books thus we find the great hunger and demand for the bible could be answered god raised up many mighty men of which luther was but one calvin and swingley were two other luminaries and besides these were many many more who are not so well known however though all this was not in vain the mighty work of god was actually hindered by these very men for one thing they did not oppose the church state marriage of the nicene council but actually fostered that union the defense of the gospel by the state was welcomed though there was no word for it and though we can see the wrath of man praising god in such events as henry viii taking up for the reformation and the rejection of papal authority it was a far cry from the truth of pentecost and protection of an omnipotent god in spite of luther's constant teaching against outside interference in local church matters he was not able to clear men's minds of the bishop archbishop concept of church government thus the church took one step in the right direction but still remained shackled so in short order she was again imprisoned in the same dungeon when she had attempted to escape still the cup of the abominable works was not yet full not only did luther through poor judgment insight to battle and thereby caused the death of multitudes but singley's party persecuted unto prison the godly doctor hub and though it did not commit him to the stake it was actually responsible in great measure for his eventual death by fire and calvin did no less for he demanded the arrest of servitus who had seen and taught the oneness of the godhead the state then tried this brother and to calvin's dismay he was burned at the stake if there was ever a time of denominational zeal it was at this tragic time the words of comenius describe much of this era comenius wrote the one thing needful he compares the world to the labyrinth and shows that the way out is by leaving what is needless and choosing the one thing needful christ the great number of teachers he says is the reason of the multitudes of sects for which we shall soon have no names left each church reckons itself as the true one or at least as the purest truest part of it while among themselves they persecute each other with the bitterest hatred no reconciliation is to be hoped for between them they meet enmity with irreconcilable enmity out of the bible they forge their different creeds these are their fortresses and bulwarks behind which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks i will not say that these confessions of faith for we can admit in most cases that they are so are bad in themselves they become so however in that they feed the fire of enmity only by putting them away altogether would it be possible to set to work on healing the wounds of the church to this labyrinth of sects and various confessions and other belongs the love of disputation what is attained by it has a single learned strife ever been settled never their number has only been increased satan is the greatest softest he has never been overcome in a strife of words in divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of god each one chatters as he pleases for kills time by learned disquisitions and disproving the views of others of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of christ to become partaker of the divine nature second peter 1 4 scarcely anything is said of the power of the keys the church has almost lost the power of binding only the power of loosing remains the sacraments given as symbols of unity of love and of our life in christ have been made the occasion of bitterest conflict a cause of mutual hatred a center of sectarianism in short christendom has become a labyrinth the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and you are made a heretic if there is one of them you do not accept what can help only the one thing needful return to christ looking to christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith ephesians 4 13. as the heavenly master built everything on the ground of the scriptures so should we leave all particularities of our special confessions and be satisfied with the revealed word of god which belongs to us all with the bible in our hand we should cry i believe what god has revealed in this book i will obediently keep his commands i hope for that which he has promised christians give ear there is only one life but death comes to us in a thousand forms there is only one christ but a thousand antichrists so thou knowest o christendom what is the one thing needful either thou turnest back to christ or thou goest to destruction like the antichrist if thou art wise and wilt live follow the leader of life but you christians rejoice in your being caught up hear the words of your heavenly leader come unto me answer with one voice even so we come [Music] you
