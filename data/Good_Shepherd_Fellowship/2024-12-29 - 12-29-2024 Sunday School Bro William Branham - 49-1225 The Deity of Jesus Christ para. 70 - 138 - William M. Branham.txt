[Music] [Music] this morning they think of some little object of worship some little manger out there some little that I'm not thinking of that I'm thinking of Christ the hope of glory in our hearts this morning by the Holy Ghost that's right oh condemned by The World God has always come into the world when he did the world hated him as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the Son of God we're in that day friends and now notice a little while the world will see me no more yet you'll see me for I'll be with you even in even to the end of the world that's right he's here now end of the days how his big picture always reviled up and made the same thing come to pass that we're now the great drama set and we're ready now to see great things happen the church has been brought from the cradle that's right Pentecostal rock it down y a few years ago back there while the people throw stones and made fun and laugh but she grow to maturity now that's exactly right hours here hallelujah that's right that's what I'm interested in to see God's Church coming together now we've been beat out here and beat out there but the hours coming with God swor the blanket around us all to draw Us in for the enem is at the gate Hallelujah yes sir he said his people Daniel said the great things of the last days when these things come to pass my the great exploits will the people that a man of faith will do and that day and The Hours come now that when the Great drama picture of God sent forth of the latter rain Joel said in the last days that shall come to pass I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy upon all my hands maids and made Ser I pour out of my spirit and I'll show signs in the heaven above and signs in the earth below and fillers the fire paper of smoke that shall come to pass before the great terrible day of the Lord shall come whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Jesus stand there these things that I do you shall do in greatness for I go unto my father hallelujah hallelujah there's what he said in there and and the word back there said if you abide me and my word abide in you ask what you will and it shall be given unto you a few years ago the people around here said you people up there that Tabernacle Holy Rollers you're all this that you're am but oh my we stood on that what was true the bapm of the Holy Ghost and now the power of almighty God is part in the church coming forth Hallelujah going to shake the whole thing everywhere brother it's already in session right now it's going on that's right the deity of him who is he someone thinks him a little baby back there he's the one that stood on the invisible oh my platform red down his hands and spoke it said let there be light and there was light that was Jesus Christ all he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not he was he's the deity of God look what he did back there talk about the miraculous back there he talk about shouting when he performed the miraculous things to make things which are now out of things which was not he spoke and it was so and that same power that same Christ Hallelujah that's the fundamental that that people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same that spoke the world into existence is in those people the holy ghost man and women it's time that we found out who you are a devil's trying to hide you back and tell you that you're someone will cow down something you're not you're Sons and Daughters of God the deity is not in you Hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God lives in you life my life I give zo the life of God is in the human being he stood back there he is a creator of all things he made life frogs whole beasts ducks chickens animals created everything nothing was made for what was made of him who Christ he brought down plagues and everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the the mouths of line he quench the B the power they take the edge of the Tor they raise the Dead from the grave who Christ oh my what was he who is he Christ the deity and brother sister that deity is in you world you shall see me I'll be with you even in you to the end of thee Christ in the manger no Christ in you hallelujah amen we're not worshiping Christ in but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of Life Hallelujah the Creator God himself not yet appear what we shall be but we'll see as he is or we'll be made like him no room foring people around here seeth they they're of Christ their Churches of Christ they go to what the Hat my I open up the Christmas let's see about daddy in there the on under the Christmas tree of a any man like c a big box of beer somewhere no room for Jesus all for beer open up present a deck of cards no room for Christ the car that's right instead of a little bible or something to the children here's a little Gman book or little something like there no room for Jesus instead of going to church he go to show dances everything you call themselves Christians brother when the deity of by the Holy Ghost comes into the human heart he C about everything and Christ has you know that's the truth Christ the whole of Glory in you not in the Cradle in you that was one time God was back in the beginning then he come in Moses he come in the children of Israel he come into the Cradle but now they're worship way back like some prehistoric something when Christ is in you that's right here he is today the Son of God moving up his great church is moving today the church has soup suppers P suffers see who can dress the best going to the church for pop Glory who got the best Church the best seat who can play this who can do that and no room all times they got something else to do besides prayer they can't pray anymore they got something else to do they can't pray anymore they just can't learn serve God like they used to no room for in the end and this is in the end time friend no room for him in the end of course I know what that end me but I'm referring to this end but the Bible said in that day when the Almond Tree shall flourish desire of man shall fail because he goes to his long home and the MERS go about the street or the silver card be broken the pcture broken the pountain oh mercy my friends but the prophet also said it'll be light in the evening time that's right the have of Glory you your surely find that's right the eveny times come the church that was once press back that little maor experience that we've been through has come to a place now that the people are realizing that the deity of the power of almighty God is living in the human being oh brother sister let me speak to you in the name of Jesus this morning do you still hear me oh my let me tell you something the times coming when women and man are just about like they dress so much like you can't tell one from the other that's right all those things in the Bible say would come to pass it's here that's right J that's the truth is it the truth is it the truth it is the truth they act like look like tuss like talk like the Bible tell would be that way he said the last days that Peerless times would come man would be lovers of their own selves more than lovers of God TR sprinkers false accusers is it here that's right oh glory to God I feel something rolling in my soul I a i as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man amen Noah had some faithful ones in that day God got some faithful ones today the hours coming this great drama setting man and women is the Holy Ghost is dwelling in you the Christ that was born 1900 years ago came to man who he never stayed in the cradle and today that Memorial of his birthday what do they do they get some tree cut it down make a Christmas tree for the kitties but they think that's all right I'm not kicking against that but the thing of it is they put more on the Christmas tree than they do for Christ that's right Chris crinkles all over the country who was a German a Catholic saint years ago an old man went about doing good and today it's become almost a worship that's right it's all right to tell the kitties or whatever you want to do as far as I'm concerned but the thing of it is it's so easy to fall in that rad on the other side and push out Christ to the real fundamentals of Christmas of Christmas 10 man take Chris crinkle instead of real Christmas that's right no room for in in it's all draw down we had time I it's getting late and it's getting late but look friends the hour has come and is now that when God's Great drama set here before us the Son of God that was in the Cradle is in the heart now he's the deity of God he's God the Creator he said all things he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not and today that's what's the matter with the church the hope of glory the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into the people's hearts and they don't recognize what it is they think it's a little church joining or something like that but that is The Godly Creator living in you and giving you all the powers and you're in possession of anything that he had so is it in you to abstain from Evil to do good to shun evil and flead to righteousness to turn away from temptation all malice hatred Strife envy and so forth turn away from him for that'll take him from your heart if you will receive him Embrace him and love and hold it in your heart and love him I tell you the church together and that kind of a power has the power to find the heavens over the of the the cripples walk the blind SE why it's recognizing the power of almighty God into your heart there he is the deity you love him the of the for Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound had saved a wret like me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I seen dear brother sister if you haven't caught the baptism of the Holy Ghost morning run into the kingdom of God as quick as you can the ceiling time is on the enemy is coming like a foood he's raising a standard against it the drama said the church is going home is as certain as anything you haven't got all ways to wait friends you haven't got all the time to wait you better come now you better make it to day that's right while today is the day make it now remember friends it Mak seem strange the world never the religion of Christ never was popular it's always been unpopular the religion of God because the devil is the prince of powers the air he has all the governments every government is controlled by the devil according to the Bible devil said it was that's right he controls all the governments and then the Bible said Rejoice all you Holy Angels and you Saints upon the Earth part the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our God and if is Christ and he shall reain Satan took Jesus up on top of the mountain show him all the king the world said these are all mine and I'll give them to you and Jesus said get thee H Satan that's right he wasn't care he said my kingdom of this world I could call eight agion of angels but my kingdom is not all this world but my kingdom is in heaven and he said the kingdom of God will be within you so therefore the legions and powers in the backing of the Holy Angels Hallelujah is in you the about Christ BM of the Holy Ghost yes sir who are you this who is Christ Jesus he's in you as much as you let him be he's pressing trying to get into you to move into you today and you stand off and wonder and look and gaze and hold back a little while don't do that move right straight into the of God hour sh hallelujah oh how I love him he's coming one of these days I want to see him don't you I want to see him I believe we will see him don't you he's here now his power is moving what makes the people cry and Shout go on what's the matter is the holy ghost moving in them if they can only realize and embrace it embrace the Holy Ghost believe him hug him to your bosom live right do nothing that would hinder him say oh Lord Jesus I want you I want you to stand by me I'm going to stand by you father and as you do he's just pressing to get into you he wants in there he's W you to him all the time now prise I know this to be the truth I know people don't realize who you are every person here can live above sin can live without sin Living God you will make mistakes but the blood of Christ will forgive you father forgive them for they know not what they do is that right that same power of Christ that was hung on calvary's cross the same God that raised him up on the day of the Resurrection is in you now you that's got the Holy Ghost oh don't you love him oh my here his voice calling today move him up to your close bosom and say or close into your bosom and say now Lord Jesus I've been a little different but this Christmas Day I realize who you are now I once worshiped you as a little baby in a mananger I've seen you back out a little B fell 1900 years ago and I thought oh if I could went up to Jerusalem today they're getting pastes and everything to go up to the to the Cradle up to the place where he's born the same manger but friends it's not up there where he was born it's right here where he was born God has brought him down to every one of us and his living being is living in us oh the Creator the thing that created the world and created the heavens created the earth created man is right in every individual it's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost today that's the thing that's a secret receive the Holy Ghost he's in you he's the hope of glory and look here in the Old Testament as I've referred to it many times when the contract was made it was torn apart over a dead Beast body and those two contracts had to be come together that contract had to Dove tail one with the other and today God made a contract not because you were good not because you joined church not because you've been a good in society you can be ever so good you can live a clean life you can go to church every day you can sacrifice every day you can give a part of your money you can give up all the sins of the world and everything and live just as true and faithful as you can and you will miss Heaven is as far as East is from the West that's right it isn't about goodness that we are saved but it's by his Mercy that we are bought that God B to make Sons and Daughters goodness never makes them the spirit of God makes them if it wasn't so he wouldn't had to send the Holy Ghost how could the Holy Ghost ghost be complete how could the the contract be complete Jesus said I'll go away yet I'll come again and be with you even in pray the father and he'll give you the Holy Ghost he will abide with ever and people put their name on church books try to turn a new page on Christmas day try to walk down to church and pay a few tributes to the manger back when the Holy Ghost pushing and the world ground say well that's a bunch of holy rers just like it was in the days of no so is the coming of the son of God going not that's right and only those who are charged by the Holy Ghost who have Immortal Life living in man the Holy Ghost that's the tip that's going to be C from here anything that was something about that little Ark in the days of Noah that floated on top of water it was a drawing power from above there was a light in the top let the glory of God Shine from Heaven I tell you today friends my words there the dra from the church from the pastor but from Glory Holy Ghost be down Church what is it the power of God the access to his life Zoe these things that I do shall you do also greater than shall you do he was persecuted last at mun and died and went the grave but he was true he had the spirit of God in God raised him up if we go the same way talk we can oh Hallelujah h still hear me you love him you love him with all your heart isn't he wonderful oh my I has seen ear has heard what's recorded in God's word isn't he wonderful wonderful let's bow our heads Heavenly Father oh Jesus I'm looking forward for a great hour I see it coming I see there's no hopes nowhere else I see the age of moving up I see the great red lights of Communism yeah swaying around over the earth I see the far more churches taking a standard against your church trying to condemn them same Divine Healing is wrong it's a bunch of ftic it of building our own White House to close it down oh God the other day sitting there
