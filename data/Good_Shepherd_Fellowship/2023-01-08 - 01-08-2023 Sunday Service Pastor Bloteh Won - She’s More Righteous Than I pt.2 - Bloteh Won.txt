realized I did a lot of singing last week before I look at the time it was 12 30. so you have been preaching long because you keep me singing all the time so praise the Lord and then you blame me for preaching long naturally you are the one as you blame amen now Genesis chapter 38 we were right in there in the story of tema I want us to go right back there this morning sorry that was I was accounted for a long Winger last Sunday very slow because my body was just I mean I was trying to get out of my jet Lair from South Africa and then I put a strain in my back again trying to get out of this snow out of the way and out of there so my body has just been going through a change amen but I believe it's a change for the better praise the Lord and once again we want to say happy birthday to all our birthday folks uh sister Ruth had a birthday and Rochelle and prayer birthday coming up in all the January uh uh children happy birthday amen may the Lord bless and bless and keep you praise the Lord yeah we we get into this story of 10 ayem and we went through a whole lot of the story last week and uh praise the Lord then let's let's drop down to uh verse 25. let's drop down to verse 25 praise the Lord let's read from verse 24 it will give us a good background year and it came to pass about three months three months after that it was told Judah saying tema thy daughter-in-law have played the Harlot and also behold she is with child of wodom and Judah said bring her forth and let her be burned no flesh will be justified by the Lord that's what the law will do to our flesh the Lords the Commandment whichever way we term it no flesh will be justified if we did near High Grace none of us will be here this morning praise the Lord I had the brother opening the service this morning and said we condemn our hearts before they and then I said in the office I said Lord but we thank you for your grace amen amen that's that's exactly what happened we condemn our hearts all the time before the Lord it is only Grace that gave us face for us to live our faces up amen praise the Lord and uh verse 25 when she was brought forth she sent to her father-in-law saying by the man whose these are I am with child and she said discern discern go beyond the Lord go beyond go beyond being legalistic amen go beyond discern that's when wisdom is needed pause for the Y she said pause for the wine open your eyes look at these things praise the Lord amen there that was the same thing Jesus did with those people that took up the stone to Stone that woman he he said if there's one among you without a sin you know that word he discerned their heart praise the Lord and uh and he says woman neither do I condemn thee in another sense you are right trust in I I don't want to go in there let me just rewrite here praise the Lord I don't want to get ahead of myself this morning about a man who decide I'm with chai she said discern I pray thee who's are these the sing they're the bracelets and the staff and Judah acknowledged him he acknowledged him praise the Lord if he was a cold winter morning he was sweating he acknowledged him he dropped his heart that's what truth we do truth will humble you [Music] truth will drop your heart and uh and have your mouth hanging and Judah acknowledged him and said she has been more righteous than I because I gave her net to Sheila my son and he knew her again no more now before we said there there is there is something that is playing out here amen if you go to the to the to the beginning of the of the story uh uh uh rehab I mean uh sorry sorry tell my year in this story she has experienced she has experience uh Full House rather praise the Lord she have experienced uh pretty much the the something like the four beasts around the throne because there is there is just so much there is so much in this scripture that we have just raised so much in this story and we would just trust the Lord to bring what is our portion amen let us pray once again father we have read your word we want to ask your blessings that you will come and break the word to our hearts you know what we need father you know we're each and every one of us need and father only you can give it to us because Lord You Are The Altar you are the finisher of our faith I pray you take the bread of life this morning break it to our hearts speak to your children in a way that only you can in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord and Lord bless you you may have your seat now now is there anyone with uh a coffee Bible is there any in his coffee Bible says Alice yeah you get a coffee Bible there did you just coffee Bible on the top of itself parentheses good okay now I make mention of that uh last week it's coffee uh he uh he was a scholar he you know he was a man that uh the law blessing uh and and his his Bible is one of the known Study Bible you know it's coffee Bible Thompson Chain and all that uh so uh it's a Bible that uh you know the program or love for Faith even though a places he says There Are Places I don't agree with coffee but there are other places he commented him and so there are places in uh in uh in this coffee Bible where he uh he term out as a parentences and what I believe was happening is that as a scholar as he was studying he realized that something is introduced because when you read that story right there you see uh the Bible talking about about Joseph is talking about Joseph amen is talking about Joseph the Bible just came out of Joseph being being put into the well a type of death burial and Resurrection a type of cavalry praise the Lord amen is talking about Joseph he he's he's born with this gift of Dreams he's dreaming his brothers uh you know and are happy with him and all of these things are going on in his life but right here the Bible just came and introduced this story you know what is the significance what what what relationship it has and then after chapter 38 it picks up with Joseph again praise the Lord and even when you look at the story you look at the story in the human mind you know one time I was I was talking with uh with with with with a Muslim guy and then he was he was uh he was he was trying to talk about uh you know how how indecent the Bible is you know he his argument was I mean how can the Bible put a a story about lost sleeping with his daughters I told him I says it does not matter if it's the truth right if it is the truth it does not matter praise the Lord amen amen the thing about us human is there we always like to talk about the nice thing of ourselves we never come up in the public and say you know I used to be a rogue I used to be this you know because we always want for people to perceive her but you see this proved that this is the word of God because everything that happened in this Bible is truth it's not makeup if it was makeup those men would choose the best story they're stored about uh uh uh uh Genesis 38 it's not a decent story this is a father-in-law sleeping where his daughter-in-law is not a decent story but it's the truth it happens are we together but then when Glory called it implicit in the Bible he place it there for a reason in his great wisdom he placed there there for a reason man I was looking at some few things this is something that I kind of look look into long time ago but just for to be able to help you I I thought that I'll go back into it and and uh and and and help you again because for many for many years uh many years back I mean just just like just as a boy preacher I'm still a boy but when I was Marshall boy I praise the Lord that caught my attention they had caught my attention and then I started I remember there was uh either back 1998 when I got my first coffee Bible Lonnie Jenkins sent it for me and he was my good friend and uh uh I stayed I stick I kept the letter until until uh you know somewhere I lost it Susan Brooks was the one that bought the Bible his uh his secretary Secretary of the church there in in uh and then they mailed it to me and I was so excited I was I went through the Bible I I had it I had it on my table this morning I was going to bring it but I just thought I'll leave it back I went through it back to back I had to sew the back because the back was falling apart and uh and then a little on uh I you know I I got a company that gave me the a letter back praise the Lord amen and I was going to put my name on the Bible so I wrote my name uh uh I was just going to put brother on you know and then uh they did the first work they never did a good job they got back to me and they asked me to uh uh uh they apologized you know they wanted to do a good work and that's why I said okay this time I would not put brother one out for pastor one so now they pulled Pastor brother won praise the Lord and he did it free because their first job was not good I mean their company was going through a lot of things so but that caught my attention many years ago I was looking there I was saying there is something about this parenthesis in the in the coffee Bible you go to Revelation chapter 10 the same thing over the top of relation chapter 10 there's a parenthesis there is something about it also but uh give her instruction to Daniel down here the prophet standing in the Holy place now look in your Bible it is parenthesis where the Bible says whosoever readeth let him understand it's in parenthesis which means God is calling your attention pay attention to this pay attention to this these are the internal thoughts of God put into words and all the words in this book just like the book of Saint John said if all the things that Jesus did was recorded we will not have a book to carry it won't have a book to continue these are not just the Mad worlds of men that we can just put our human interpretation tall whosoever read it let him understand question and answers uh See Jesus refer to it said and in parenthesis you go in the gospel Jesus also referred to the same thing he says let him that readeth understand perfect strain wash these parenthesis that is this one is from Hebrew 11. of whom the word was not worthy of when the Bible was talking about all the heroes of faith the man and the women their their faith was projected Through the Bible says of whom the word was not worthy of and the scholar choose to put that into parentheses it has a weight it has a weight praise the Lord they wander in desert in mountains and dens and in order there the perfect strength of such a perfect man he used the same uh talking about that and all the her trials crew or Morgan sculpting yemo over bounding imprisonment they were soon they were sword asunder they were tempted they were slain but with a sword they wandered about in in sheepskin and ghost King and being destitute and Afflicted to method of whom the word is not worthy of see in parenthesis there you know this in your Bible piece of the trumpet now notice Revelation 1 to 7 all the Mysteries are to be revealed toward the bride by the messenger the loudisha church has anybody got a revised version Bible if you have you will notice there's where it says the angel it's in parentheses it says the ego now so parenthesis uh uh it's like an addition by the way of explanation is somehow complete in itself it holds a message is complete in itself amen you know so we see uh I brought all of this just to to show you that this story is dropped in here uh in the parentheses even though uh you know it has it has not much attachment to the the Joseph story but it has some some deep application to it in some deep way now you will see this will give you an idea of of what the seals are you know the seals are not something that are away from the scriptures the cus are right in the scripture is it will also help you to understand uh the language reading between the lines okay so this story about Judah and tema it reads between the line it it shows uh uh you know of what is uh is is taking place here what God is doing right here in the life of Joseph in the life of his I mean the history of Israel and uh uh uh going over to the Egypt and back to the promised land so last Sunday we spoke on she's more righteous than all I will I will take this as a part two to that and uh so just like I said if you if you look through uh the story here you will see that uh uh Judah first gave Tema uh his daughter-in-law to his son Earth there was uh uh the first man in her life was also giving to her to raise it onto his brother he refused and the Lord slayed him for that and that's the second man and then uh Sheila will be the third man praise the Lord and uh if you listen to the story here in Judah uh uh confession he says that because I refuse because I gave her net to Sheila my son so that's the reason why she did this and then now Judah will also now be the fourth man in her life praise the Lord but if you bring all of this over to Revelation chapter 6 you will see that uh just like how the the the Full House rather was trying to stop the blessing from coming to the church God also have a full anointing Through the Ages that was also as a defense unto the church praise the Lord amen so uh uh [Music] I mean there is there is just so much in this that I could I can just go out of out of strip and just go on and on and on but we want to we want to stay in line this uh this uh this morning uh we started off the subject uh talking on this Jesus in Matthew Chapter 5 to the disciples that accept your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the stripe and Pharisees you will no longer uh inherit the kingdom of heaven so we were looking at exceeding righteousness what is that exceeding righteousness that's what we were looking at so for us to be able to grab the picture we have to go back to Genesis and look through the Bible and see how God play out his righteousness amen because the Bible make us to know our righteousness is just like a filthy Ray amen and and and and uh if we have any righteousness is what God imputed amen is what God imputed unto us and is very very beautiful because when God started dealing with our Father Abraham the Bible says Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him amen it was not something let me just say like this let me say like this so you can grab where I'm going this morning I will not carry you down through the all around the Rabbit Trail Abraham believed that whatever he was doing was right praise the Lord amen Abraham was well acknowledged of uh uh of his weaknesses praise the Lord there over in Egypt he was reasoning in his mind if I tell these people that Sarah is my wife they're going to kill me and take her so he lied amen he faction everything in his mind he tore a line are we together praise the Lord and uh uh uh uh Hebrew chapter 11. let's look at Hebrew chapter 11. because we we need to get down we need to get this down we need to try to nail this down Hebrew chapter 11. we are trying to look at exceeding righteousness that's the picture but for us to be able to understand what Jesus meant we have to go back to Genesis because the Old Testament is a shadow of the New Testament so God play out those things in the life of his people verse 4 the Bible says by faith in their offer unto God and more excellent she's more righteous than I he offer unto God a more excellent praise the Lord sacrifice than King by which he or team Witness that he was righteous now you see when Abel was doing that Abel was not doing it with the Consciousness that I'm righteous that's why I'm doing this no he was not doing you know this is the righteous way to do it no but one thing for sure is that he was convinced that whatever he was doing was right man praise the Lord or you have to be convinced that you are in the right place this morning you have to be convinced I can be convinced for you I'm convinced that whatever I'm preaching to you is the truth I'm convinced because I know if I lie to you I'll be condemned to hell praise the Lord amen oh I'm not I'm not coming with a mind that whatever I appreciate is going to change their life no I'm more convinced that this word is true I convinced that it has the power to change our life praise the Lord are we together the Bible says he attained a witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gift so it's not Abel blowing his own trumpet amen it's not able being critical of of uh of of King's sacrifice amen and I would tell you also that King was convinced that he was doing the right thing he was convinced praise the Lord but it will tell you that uh it's not all about how sincere you are but what your sincerity is based on right praise the Lord because Faith must have a resting place and the resting place for faith is God's word not our ideas not our good intention it must be God's word because only God's word will never fail our good intentions will fail praise the Lord and sometimes that's when it hurts you so bad because your intention was good and you mean good praise the Lord that's when it can really get down to you amen but it had to be based on God's word praise the Lord it had to be based on God's word let me tell you this Bible you hold on your life for we preaching to you from this morning this is The Book of Life amen this is The Book of Life every your health lies in the pages of this Bible praise the Lord Elise your healing lies in the pages of this Bible praise the Lord you can have all the best medical center in the world Amen and all the best doctors in the world but your healing lies in the pages of this Bible praise the Lord you see the bash you were to get to work it's just an assets to get you through that door but your blessing lies in the pages of this Bible your finances lies in the pages of this Bible when you go to school and they give you a degree and that certificate has a pill and you put a stem on it amen that is just a paper for you to decorate your word but your blessing lies in the pages of this Bible [Applause] oh glory be to God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah your finances lie right in the pages of this Bible I mean it has hidden secrets and calls if you can break it your life will never be the same Hallelujah your life will never be the same if you can break into those uh uh channels of blessing amen Hallelujah sometimes we trust our bash more than we trust the pages of this Bible Hallelujah glory be to God amen as soon as you know the whole day will go won't even ask where the Bible is it's not it's 2 p.m where's my batch well no let me let me let me just stay stay with my message praise the Lord amen and just give you access to that to that building amen and the day they want to take it from you they would they would speak to you nicely and tell you just lay on the table praise the Lord but the one that make these promises he never take his word back amen he never take his word back the only thing that is limiting you from assessing is you the one that put his blessings in the pages of this book never take it back he's not an Indian giver colony praise the Lord Hallelujah the scripture says that evil had a witness he had a witness God testifying in so much that God allowed his blood to speak out of the Earth God testifying that he was righteous but when you look at the scene you look at the scene praise the Lord and that's all I want to tell you this morning you must be convinced of what you are doing praise the Lord he must be convinced of what you are doing that's why you cannot serve two masters amen there's no time to play church and play games you are either out in or you are out praise the Lord I mean he was just uh uh uh a Shepherd boy and uh uh and and and and and and and and time for worship he just he just felt like how you know this was the right thing this was the writing now you see that as as message Believers we have been exposed to such a Ministry that have opened the scriptures to us the first thing that comes to our mind Revelation what we call revelation what you call revelation what you call Revelation is something that has already been revealed to a prophet and he helps you to understand praise the Lord so to many many of us what we call Revelation is just knowledge it's just knowledge it's an after effect praise the Lord you understanding your understanding that it was blood in the Garden of Eden your understanding that God Rob Adam and Eve in a bloody Court took the fake Leaf out of them and and slay alarm and and wrap them up in that code your understanding linking it toward Abe sacrifice is that's why you call revelation I got the revelation it's called an understanding praise the Lord you just got an understanding you know I mean we then we get so excited about it that's the reason why Paul says he said knowledge puff up he says normally because when you get that understanding that then your head become big on your shoulders and you think now now you know the Bible I gave a revelation of discipancy you just have a knowledge you just have a knowledge now when that knowledge starts affecting your life when that knowledge that Suburban talks about the Supernatural part of Revelation one part is the unveiling one part is the knowledge there is another part that affects you right praise the Lord that Beyond able beyond the lamb that was slain in the Garden of Eden Beyond yet their sacrifice you now starts to see your own filthiness your own nakedness you now start to understand that Jesus died to cover the nakedness that sin is supposed to praise the Lord amen their noun is becoming a revelation because that knowledge now is now affecting you it's coming home you see that's the reason why the man can have a knowledge of the word he can talks about it he can argue about it but he can live under the privilege of the blessing which means it has no effect on his life praise the Lord it has no effect and those are the people that can get angry they can ready to fight for their revelation they're ready to beat you amen because there is really no after effect there is really no after effect get into a conversation just cross their path a little bit they get irritated they're angry you are expectancy you're going to help it's all because they are afraid of hell that's why they are blowing hell out now so we we are looking at this so we see here that evil evil his his approach to God his approach to God come in just us bringing the alarm you know like Barbara says there was not a knife so he took uh uh uh uh a rock and how cruel that looks like taking a shot Rock and then and just turning that little lamb head and you know and stripping the Rock and the blonde streaming and all of that praise the Lord amen but because he was convinced that he was doing the right thing praise the Lord because he was convinced that he was doing the right thing I mean he didn't know uh uh uh uh put the alarm down and try to cut it stacking yeah yeah no he was convinced that he was doing the right thing so he held that line down he wanted the blood to come out he wanted to put it on the altar praise the Lord some of the struggle we go through amen blood splashing all over him I was telling you my king saying how cruel he can be oh my God that God is clearer praise the Lord for hundreds of years the cruelty of our sin the cruelty of our sin will take an innocent Christ to the cross the Lord amen so you see it is dead is that it's it's one fit in it fit is if if they'll believe that what he was doing and because he was convinced he was doing the right thing amen the Bible says God bear him with us that he was righteous so in a sense God imputed righteousness to Abel because he did the right thing praise the Lord amen King was convinced he was doing the right thing but even after he did it and realized it never provide produced the result he got angry that's the difference hmm he took an offense he got angry that is the difference you believe that you are doing the right thing is it's good but when you realize that you have failed you must accept that I I have fear I need to come back and start again I need to get this right praise the Lord amen now not not getting because of your failure you get you get angry with everybody you know everybody the devil so the problem is not the people it's you that's right the problem was not able it was King his heart was not right praise the Lord the Bible says God is Not unjust to forget our labor of love God is a rewarder of them that diligent is seeking God reward he's he's the father that passes on our back when we do the right thing praise the Lord so whenever we do the right thing we do the right thing because it's the right thing to do not the right thing because I want a name or I want to be praised it's the right thing because it's the right thing to do women amen praise the Lord thank God impute righteousness praise the Lord he impaled righteousness now you see the Pharisees they are righteousness was a self-righteousness because it was it was all according to the book the length of the of the of their garment they are scared you know wide in every everything was according to the book praise the Lord amen it was all according to the book but you see when Jesus spoke to them he said you are just like a grave that is painted white outside but your heart behind the white garment is like Dead Man Bones you actual desire in your heart is different from what your outward appearing is reflecting praise the Lord amen time I've been around for a while should be in a while around for a while praise the Lord amen she knew they had this who who have caused so death if he was the wrong person so you see she set herself out for the father himself amen she said herself Our Father father himself just like we said uh uh uh last Sunday she wanted to be identified With the blessings of Abraham she wanted to be identified with The Blessing of Abraham but tell me tell me now do do tell my ever had a mind I want I want to be if I do this thing if I if I if I present myself as a halot I would be in the language of Jesus Christ that she ever had an idea on that no the right thing the hope for her the right thing is that I want to be redeemed amen I want to be redeemed the Bible says she was a Canaanite woman she wanted to be brought into the blessing praise the Lord because that was the thing that changes the strangers in Israel if a man was a stranger in Israel and you will you embody the camp you have to be circumcised even though you are a stranger if you are a second son if you are circumcised you take on the mark of the blessing of Abraham now they can count they can call you their own now for a warmer because the sign of circumcision was brought by marriage amen so for the woman she will want to have a seat she will want to have a child to be counted for the blessings or counted in the family in the household so all they tell my mind is the other uh if I just sit down here and do nothing praise the Lord this is almost three months now amen have you seen what I'm going with this so in in in her mind she wanted to be identified that the thing that drove her to that was to be counted in the blessings of Abraham praise the Lord amen coming from a house wow I never seen a halot here Howard are increasing these days she's hearing all of those things it didn't bother her she knew what she was out for amen no matter what name the car heard praise the Lord says what are your your people believing in the car and believing in this it did not bother her she knew what she was up for she believed that she believed that if this happened I'm in the season of life if this can happen I believe praise the Lord Hallelujah oh no doubt there were many men that came in and and tried to call unto her she didn't even give them and I praise the lord well that your business change you are the only holidays around you see I'm not out here for you and I was writing on how she says I'm not out here for you praise the Lord she's a daughter she's a daughter-in-law what do you think she knows all she knows all his men all his major roles praise the Lord Hallelujah are we together what was what was the desire in her heart what was pushing her was to be counted in the blessing hmm praise the Lord amen if you can tell that from Judah expression she's more righteous than I because I give not Sheila my son to her praise the Lord amen now so let's let's just deal with some few things on on righteousness here foreign let's just deal with some few things on righteousness because you see the uh since we are we were I mean uh even nature around us I mean the way the weather is going and everything is going oh my goodness praise the Lord you just think about uh you know even now I mean Hollow that uh uh this nation that God himself raised praise the Lord amen parallel to Israel and to see the things that is happening around this nation where we find ourselves praise the Lord amen is mind-blowing it's just telling you how dark the days are getting in one of the most re respected political parties they just had a drama the entire week it just shows how when the principle of God's word is overlooked a man is nothing but a beast praise the Lord amen so that's that's what I want you to I want us to be able to grab you know I want us to be able to grab because just like we said we were getting there and and and talk about it you know uh uh uh uh fact the way that God deals with us it blew my mind you know uh uh you you you uh you you listen to uh the discernments and and a lot of those things that are on tape you will realize that the discernment in most cases goes to what was lying in the people's subconscious amen here is a person here dealing with with uh with with sickness in their body a person here dealing with uh with with I mean they are so fearful so scary another prophet of God under honor the gift of God will go back in there in in in India alive that when they were six years old a dog make you afraid and that thing affected your spirit and make you nervous and all of these like all of these years you have been so nervous it is just because of that thing that affected your spirit when you were six years old so you see what the gift of God does is that it goes down to your subconscious because your subconscious is the real you right right praise the Lord your first conscience is just the vehicle that is driving your subconscious your subconscious is the real you the things that you deal with and you hide down in your feelings and in your emotions that's the real you that's the reason why I always say let's forget about it never solve a problem if it's a problem we must not forget about it let's deal with it I'll let you forget about it it does not solve a problem it does not solve a problem take that from out of your vocabulary because it's not going to help you if it's a problem let's deal with it right because the sooner we can deal with it the better we will be because if you just forget about it you have to realize that you have one ability by the the nature of falling is that you cannot forget what you think you are forgetting about you are just sending it back to your subconscious keep it for me you chunk it like this keep it for me praise the Lord then your subconscious gravity hope and just put it down praise the Lord let's forget about it in two months that's the same thing you did the last time I said I forget about it that was the very same thing glory be to God the subconscious that gave you a pass and you pick it up and then you start running with it to go do a touchdown so you see you we all dress ourselves up nice letting you know try keep a smile on our face this morning and we all trying to pay attention and you you're trying to keep as smart I mean but you see reality the preaching of the word goes beyond all your beautiful nice faces the preaching of the Gospel it's ordained to go and hunt in your subconscious praise the Lord amen that's the reason why the preacher can say it's one thing and you are just caught in it your mind's like oh yeah and and the rest of the rest of the thing he's saying you you are not with him for a while because that thing just have been identified with something in your subconscious and you are just dwelling in debt for a while and all the the one hour I take yelling and everything is that one thing you remember why because the subconscious pick it up and say there is something here that identified with what I'm dealing with praise the Lord have everybody I see our service today oh wonderful what did the preacher preach I don't know praise the Lord and sometimes you you want to feel bad about it but it's nothing to feel bad about praise the lord it's nothing to feedback you should only feel bad if you were sleeping right praise the Lord because it will have been better for you to stay in your bed where you are stretching flat amen then to be knocked in your head and almost want to knock the person before you praise the Lord amen why because what happened is that as you are hearing the word the Bible says faith come about hearing and hearing of the word of God as you are hearing the word your subconscious is pulling and your subconscious is pulling on the word and and and that's the same thing that's that's what faith is that's what Revelation is praise the Lord sometimes you are reading something in God's word and and it just and honestly just open to you you love it and for a while it gone oh man I couldn't just I can't remember yeah I can't remember it it was good no it's just going down praise the Lord you realize as you go on couple of weeks when you feel you are reading the word or something you are doing it will just pop out again there will be some action that that word that is so down in your heart will be identified with praise the Lord and that is the same thing with fears that is the same thing without I was listening to uh to something on trauma the last time or this this gone week two weeks now I've been I've been listening to it and I mean a very beautiful research very beautiful research uh uh and and something was said that that just I just it's not that it blew my mind but it's just it just makes me to see the other side uh uh and uh and and this doctor was saying the other oh man I hope I hope I can be able to to really digest the whole thinking and you know that God can be able to bless it in a way we can be able to take something from there to to be able to bring you see I was I was I started speaking here on on the message uh entitled to the abuse for some reason I can't get back to that message here I don't know why every time I look at the subject I want to get back to it uh uh for some reason I don't know why I'm just not uh uh not having the Liberty to to get into it but it's it's something that when I when I get back to studying and look into it and every time I deal with all of these things trauma and different things it it kind of for waking the reality of that to to me of how much that uh every one of us every man born of a woman is one way or the other we have experienced some level of abuse in our life praise the Lord just for the fact that we are born in sin it's an abuse it's an abuse the serpent abuse our mother Eve and it has affected us with a sinful nature praise the Lord and all of those things whatever we deal with the the good things like the the word the revelation of the word as it goes down and and and and and so in our subconscious as Faith that's the same way with the negative things we deal with praise the Lord they said there they say they especially when we don't deal with them as a Believer we have been giving the grace to be able to deal with those things and by God's grace we can bring them to the Fountain drain from Immanuel vein and we can place some of those hurtful things under the blood we will not forget about them but every time they comes to our mind we will have the grace to know that his grace is sufficient praise the lord we will have the grace we will continue to claim Lord your grace is sufficient your strength is made perfect in my weakness praise the Lord Hallelujah and and that and and and for for for for most of the fact is that's the reason why they are hard to talk about because they are hurtful foreign and this guy was saying he says uh uh he says the more the doubt the more the awareness as I pause it for a while I said is there a good thing in doubt praise the Lord amen he says the little the doubt the little your awareness the more you doubt the more your awareness processes um okay okay so you see that as we talk about these ones of faith and these ones that righteousness was imperative you will realize that uh uh uh just like we said they were living their life and they were not they were not trying to uh uh you know they were not trying to to live out God's righteousness you see the the that deceitfulness that have happened in the recent time in the Christian age and it all goes back to that mother of heart she had brought such a deceitfulness upon the church and all of that thing has has made us to uh to uh uh to to put on you know a lot of self-righteousness praise the Lord when the church separated a certain group of people and it says these people they are just like uh the Virgin Mary and and these other people they are the holy fathers and they put them in white garment and over the years they have been highly esteemed and highly respected you know we we look at their outward closed and we just think oh my God these people are holding and all of that it it has just it have just it has Spilled Out a spirit of hypocrisy praise the Lord that we just think that you know our our Christianity is in our fine dresses that we wear our decent clothes that we wear we need to get the best clothes and the expensive one and all of that and we so it just all brought down to that praise the Lord oh yeah we must be decent amen I love to be descent it's it's a good thing I'm not I'm not crying on there but I'm just I'm just trying to show how uh uh the dominance of Catholic Spirit over the church is Spill out hypocrisy praise the Lord amen is spew out do you know even in a time of reformation in in a time of the Reformation your position in the church I mean where you sit it was based on how much money you make do you know that oh yeah it was based on how much money you make the rich bought their seats in the church the boy they are places these places was father Jones that's that's their Road nobody can sit there because every month they pay this amount of money amen the pleasant state to the back and sometimes they just have to stand up because even though the June says are not there but nobody can sit in their seats the seat is left empty it took one reformer Mela he he was the one that blasted against that in the England Church before it started coming an awareness to the people praise the Lord as I talk about this now there are just a lot of things that is going through my mind there's a lot of things that is going through my mind you look at the Bible look at the New Testament you look at the New Testament that's the reason why in every in every episode Paul always address something where he says uh Master be kind to your slave slave become to your masters because the New Testament Church was filled with those kind of for people amen the people that were finding hope in Redemption hope and salvation where the slaves praise the Lord those were the people hearing about a Redemption about a freedom they are the gospel could bring today praise the Lord and when they will sit down honor the teaching of of Paul and will realize that the gospel can make them and their masters to sit on the same table praise the Lord amen that even Paul will get right there and and and then he will frowned I peed it because he saw the Jews and he wanted to separate himself from the brethrings Paul will frown at him and said this is not what Christ died for praise the Lord glory be to God I'm kind of for straight in from my from my thoughts here but what I wanted what I was driving to before I got into all of this thing is to let us to know that uh uh uh I mean uh whatever the economy is going whatever wherever the nation is going wherever the word is driving tall in one sense it's not in our favor this word is not our home amen is going to get more nasty for the Believers it's going to get more uncomfortable for the Believers praise the Lord and let me tell you there are a lot of things that will happen that will make us over and over to doubt our faith right here and I think it's because we are getting in the wine press the Bible talks about a wine press in Revelation God is allowing these things to begin to squeeze us praise the Lord so we can realize what we are made out of is actually inside what we are made out of the things that is carrying you the thing that is governing your life praise the Lord that is not the bank account it's now your your job title it's not your position is now your achievement but it's what God has invested in you the investment that he made to have kept you from the day you were separated from your mother warm the things he allow you to go through also the things that Grace through the preaching of the Gospel have imparted to you praise the Lord all of these things all of these things we are getting to the wine praise the Lord amen so more and more he's making us to begin to look inside begin to look inside and appreciate those things that Grace is doing inside praise the Lord amen that Grace is doing inside we go through different trials and different things we deal with glory be to God and we are looking to something you know uh uh maybe uh a job application a change of job you know maybe to raise my income we are looking to more to those things it's not don't don't think that I'm frowning at that we are looking to those things that's that's the thing consciously we look to but the things that is holding you until those things come on Amen why you don't have those things here you don't have the degree you don't have the job you don't have the position the thing that is holding you and carrying you daily before those things come if they will ever come praise the Lord sometimes we ain't know it sometimes we pay no attention to it amen you don't have that year but there is something that is bringing you some satisfaction all right praise the Lord we are getting to dark Waters these are becoming glooming not day not night will be in promised in the evening time there shall be light this light has been shining praise the Lord use that light to brighten your path amen because the date is getting more darker it's getting more darker and there are things that are happening I mean the church is getting to its lowest part you know with criticians and all the things that is happening you know and and all of that but let's go ahead here and and be able to look at this I think that's that's one of the reasons why I feel that I'm dry I'm I'm I'm I'm being driven in this area because I want us I'm hoping that the grace of God will be able to help us to see that uh uh God has made some investment in our lives we've been playing the message investment God has made some investment in our lives praise the Lord and where your treasure is there your heart will be so it shows where God is is where his treasure is amen if you are God's treasure then his heart is after you praise the Lord because he have invested in your life all of these years every time you come to service there is something that is said and your subconscious pick it up and just drop it down amen some people you know the the you know they have uh they have some people use ATM machines some people go right to the counter and and turn all the bills to the person there some people use piggy bank maybe I'm a piggy bank guy you know little toss just drop down Nicholas and dime but God has invested in our lives amen he has invested in our lives and you put all of those piggy banks are for rainy days and the things that God have invested in our life is for these dark days praise the Lord is for all of these dark days and the gloomy days and the things that is coming upon the word and all of that but God has invested because he has a people on Earth he has invested because he has a bride amen let the enemy come as a floor amen God has a people that will be extender there will be a people that will live out his righteousness that is for us to understand how he's dealing with us how he's dealing with us more on the subconscious level praise the Lord more on the subconscious level trying to steal things down there so all of those faith that has been lying dumbing will start to burst forth because I'm telling you this bride will not barely make it she will overcome amen she will overcome he that overcome praise the Lord amen she will overcome because that's what the word says and the world overcome means to overcome that's what it means it means to overcome Hallelujah believe I'm talking about Zacharias he says Zacharias a righteous man not a sinless man but a man that depends on his righteousness depend on God's righteousness by confessing his wrong to God the Bible says uh Zacharias was a righteousness take this and say it's not a sinless man now a sinless man because you see that's the same thing I'm saying because of what the the mother church has done that mother hollowed because of the way they have gravitis sin amen so the way that we understand righteousness is to be sinless praise the Lord that's why you are uh uh uh you know we we feel condemning and Lord I'm not watching Lord I'm a sinner saved by Great Law I'm a sinner yes yes you are a sinner but Grace has already saved you Grace have already saved you Grace is changing your life praise the Lord now when will we say Lord thank you I'm a Son of God Lord thank you I'm a daughter of God I was a sinner saved by grace but now I'm a Child of God praise the Lord amen what would that be our confession our confession is always brother brother Johnny I've ripped this thing off praise the Lord that was what happened when we get excited he he takes another one here that speaks about Elijah in in James chapter 5. the effectual faith and prayer of a righteous man now you see where we are going Judah says she's more righteous than I amen now take Judah as the father he was the father-in-law Tema was the bride praise the Lord it means that this bride is going to express more of God's righteousness God is going to express his righteousness through his people in a way that it will be hard for our mind to comprehend because our mind has been so abused praise the Lord that we feel condemned for the least thoughts that comes through our mind but God is going to express his righteousness through Us in so in such a way when the whole world and and and and and and especially the internet age and all of the things that is projected there is to abuse the mind and and destroy the youthfulness but if God by his grace is God in your heart as a young man if God by his grace is giving you discernment to know what to turn away from praise the Lord then that is his righteousness that's being projected to you praise the Lord you are God's righteousness in this filthy age praise the Lord the grace that is given to fight against evil thought he's going to express his righteousness see how Tema Express a righteousness that was greater than the righteousness everybody respected Judah when he walked down the city everybody knew that that was Judah he was a prince that's why the star the bracelets all of those things man he was the prince highly respected by the Lord but see how that righteousness of tema beat him amen you will never even think that it was a righteousness because of the way she disguised herself how can she put herself out there can you imagine the whole Council sending up all the others and Tama coming and says tell me about a man to have this can you imagine what happened to the people they were standing there with their mouth drop open wow how did she did this how my God you think about how they went back to their homes come we married a girl like that I don't want giving me a problem in the house praise the Lord now I'll be brought forth and let her be burned can you see everybody coming together the story they came with they went back with a seal open they went back with a revelation that they had never thought about in their life everybody came that morning with different story in their mind praise the Lord that's one thing about this Canada woman you can never trust them every one of them are Daughters of halots you can never everybody blasting together their own story in your mouth what is praise the Lord and the chief the other saying before the congregation she's more righteous praise the Lord amen that's the reason why I don't tell God Gave You Grace to understand the tasks that were behind this Prophet you will hold this very message and live in legalism praise the Lord you will be wanting to please brother Branham more than to please God when brother Brannon was bringing God's thoughts we will seek to please and be in good line and friendship praise the lord we just want to preach what this other person preach we just run because we want to stay in a council this was the thought of almighty God glory be to God he waiting on God God is waiting on you amen he's waiting on you to break the piggy bank he said I've invested so much in your life try to use it amen try to use it I was listening to a story of one one one musician he was telling the story about his golly mother before he rise to fame and all that and he's one of these guys that is thinking all of these uh you know Hillsongs and uh he was talking about uh you know he was he was you know his his mommy was helping him to pay his his rent you know and every time you go to his mom and his mom was you know ask him are you reading your Bible so the mother taught that okay I'll send this boy get send him a new Bible and what she did was that she put his rent for the sequence of most to come in the Bible you know she put him in the Bible the book The Books of the Bible you know so she she gave him a brand new Bible and he come complaining to his mom and she says have you read your Bible so Mom I'm not talking about people I'm talking about my rent praise the Lord amen the mom says I say you should read your Bible don't talk to me until you read your Bible praise the Lord he went home and got mad and then I mean they have already issue him eviction notice praise the Lord he went to his mom crying have you read your Bible praise the Lord and then when he went home let me read his Bible because I know if I tell her I read the Bible she would tell me tell me what you read so I can lie to her praise the Lord and when he took the Bible out of the cover his ring was lying right in there praise the Lord amen and that changed his life that little art of faith change his life to realize that what we need is right in the pages of this book right in the pages of this book praise the Lord we are waiting on God and he's waiting on us to start to reach down reach down by faith into the treasure and take out some of those things let's read this and find a place to close here now the righteous man is not a sinless man for you notice he said that's James Elijah was a man subject to like passion as we are that's what James said the Elijah was a man subject to lack passions like we are we saw in the scripture he got angry and caught a bear to eat of those children he had his ups and downs and his differences and the scripture of his life proved that he had his ups and down like we do he had his his time of wandering in his time that he was his time his Temple got away from him praise the word praise the Lord amen another guy said temper is good it's bad when you lose it amen Temple is good it's bad when you lose it glory be to God amen and yeah he he got his temper away from him and he had a lot of things that went wrong but he was still a righteous man because he confessed his own wealthiness and believe in God praise the Lord amen he confessed his own righteousness and he believed in God so that's what made him righteous praise the Lord you see what was happening with those Patriots was around them all the nations around them were hidden Nations amen all the nations the Canaanites all the nations were the nation seven forced God what is difficult for us is the hypocracy amen that the mother Church the the impersonation that the Catholic church has put upon the word and has given birth to all of this church all of these different groups that is claiming to be Church of Christ Church of the Living God and all of that so it important but you see you see the uh with with the Patriots the old says all the nations around them were hidden praise the Lord so you see no matter what they were dealing with they they I mean it was hard for them to be Chalet because they had to look up to God violence praise the Lord by any religious cycle this group want to be better than this group you know because we are looking and comparing ourselves one with another he confesses on walterness and he believes in God so that's what make him righteous we are not righteous with ourself within ourself we are righteous through Jesus Christ I cannot be Sanctified within myself I am Sanctified through Jesus Christ who stands in the presence of God be my place it is in my Holiness it's his holiness praise the Lord amen so how do we sing that song Holiness Holiness is all I want to be how do we sing it are we are we singing it with a striving mind in myself uh you know no we we have to be looking to our sacrifice we have to be looking to the one that uh that uh that is standing in the presence of God for us praise the Lord it is in my Holiness it's his Holiness my Holiness won't work at all but he's done because God God don't accepted him amen praise the Lord Hallelujah and in accepting he he had to accept me praise the Lord Hallelujah God did not accept Abel before his sacrifice Abel was accepted in his sacrifice praise the Lord amen we are made accepted in the Beloved that's what Paul says that's what makes it real isn't it then we don't have to depend on ourselves now that doesn't make us says we can sin brother if you sin you just you are just away from God that's all there is only one thing to do is confess it and get right get right with God as long as you desire to sin the desire of sin is still in your heart then it's time to stay down other altar till that thing is taken out of you praise the Lord so you see this net it's not making excuses here for weaknesses amen is giving it you you have a work to do you have to give it to him you have to surround it to him you have to surround those weaknesses those challenges to God and say let your strength be made perfect in my weakness praise the Lord now see how brother Brown did with this year he says as long as you desire to sin the desired of sin is in your heart he says then it's time to sit down at the altar till that thing is taken out now now you will sing you are bound to sin cause you just can't help it but not willful thing amen now willful sin what does that willfulness comes it tied to the desire amen a tie told the desire your sin you make mistakes praise the Lord amen you can't control the task that comes to your mind and the ones that don't comes to your mind praise the Lord Hallelujah sometimes you can't control the things that pass up on your phone but you have the willpower in you to get away from it praise the Lord you have the willpower to get away from it now when you go looking for it then which means there is something in you that is hungering fulfilled then that is that desire now you have to bring under the altar it's that place you have to say God burn this thing out of me and you got to hit it you got to get to the place where you hate it you are angry that is ruining your life is rubbing your mind it's taking your time you will sin you are bound to accurs you just can't help it but now well for he that sinned willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth they remitted no more sacrifice but every day you are bound to sin you see the balance that he's bringing every day every day every day you will have one challenge or another if it is not what you hear is what comes to your mind if not is maybe there's something you said out of your mouth and you are bound to backslide constantly so it takes a constant prayer to God Paul says I Die daily and if poor had to Die daily how much more I'm going to have to stay there Dead all the time now that I would die let me stay there dead I don't even want to wake up if Paul had to die to stay right with God so we all have to do that just die out to yourself and that's getting and that's getting God's that's getting God's will now he says there is two will two ways to anything I want to read this in that close that's the right word and the wrong way and then and then ways are you your ways in God's way and you can be in your way in God's way at the same time you can be in your wedding God's way at the same time you have got to get out of your own way to get into God's way for as long as you are in your own way you are out of his way I love how he closed this he said so forsake your way forsake your thoughts forsake everything and just rely on one thing thus say the Lord what does God say the Lord the word the word is don't say the Lord bring it back to the word amen bring it back to the word don't make it to Faith if it Faith you will know the word is faded bring it back to the word praise the Lord if something in you that is condemning you to do that then leave it it's wrong because you will never believe yourself in that way you will never believe yourself God wants you to believe him amen Jesus said if you don't believe me believe the works God wants you to believe him and after we have believed him we must believe what his grace is doing in our life it brings us to the place for us to believe what we are doing amen when we come here on Sunday morning it's not just our religious right praise the lord we believe that we are entering into his presence we believe that we're going to hear from our tear funding we believe there is so much power in this building to change our life we believe we are coming just like the road of Aaron that was placed into the shekhana glory and we can go out of this place bring you full fruits bump it into New Life new courage new Strength praise the Lord that's where God infused righteousness amen that's where he impute righteousness said they said blessed my heart last night he says I'm going to quit smoking talking about resolution and I'm going to quit lying stealing you are doing that in yourself there are still doesn't make you safe I'm going to go to church and to try to do better there are still doesn't means it's salvation listen to this you have got to be born again and righteousness comes righteousness only comes to the attribute of a believing life righteousness only come to the attribute of a believing life a life that constantly believe God's word God every time you believe God's will he impute righteousness righteousness believing life to the attribute of a believing life praise the Lord amen a bit of time I said when this is all said and done Judah will send people to go practice from our father house when he was sending me I went I went alone when this is said and done I will now go bring my things he will send men he was saying chariots to go gather my things because now I'll be looking like the princess praise the Lord amen and I believe when this is said and done praise the Lord amen when this is said all said and done glory be to God the devil would know that we're not just like Eve amen we are not like Eve that he never got he got to eat before Adam got to Eve but Christ got to us before he even tempted praise the Lord so you will realize that we are not like Eve before even we came to Consciousness science says that by the age of six years that's when you start Gathering things in your subconscious praise the Lord it says that's when you start Gathering things in your subconscious but where Prophet God will says when when you were born he says God slip that seed just like a body at your first birth He Slipped that seed so God bypassed the devil amen he bypassed the devil he went ahead of him when this is all said and done he will know about this bride is not like Eve I'm telling you he would know that this bride is not like Eve you might be talking we might be nothing now ahead amen don't always believe when people are not in their head I believe in you that's why I never preached to convince people because people get different different reactions amen I just I just preached the word amen so that when people are not in your head you're thinking okay come come keep talking not listening to you come the Lord bless you musicians you can come praise the Lord [Applause] Hallelujah so we're going to strive we're going to strive a little bit we're going to do it on righteousness for a while we're going to talk about righteous man in the Bible we're going to talk about Imperial righteousness praise the Lord because I I believe God is saying this bride is righteous and I because he is the expression of my righteousness I became sin for her and she became my very righteousness praise the Lord if you love the Lord you appreciate the Lord amen you got to appreciate what God has been doing in your life [Applause] that investment that he has made in your life God is not playing games it's not playing game this is a serious business this is just a serious business [Music] can you imagine that term I was trying to do everything that Judah would not recognize her so it was a life and death business you think about it [Music] she was doing everything that Judah will walk from that house go and not even know that that was his daughter-in-law that was a death life and death so people this is a serious business [Music] it's a serious business [Music] you asked Paul so one of the greatest move of God [Music] has opened his word and and and I suppose all of this truth to you it's not just for hair knowledge it's not just so for to be counter in the number this is a serious business this is a life-changing business and can you realize that all of the time that God was doing things around your life there are half of them you never even knew that he was the one he disguised himself in different situations and use different people and you never knew he was the one this is a serious business foreign this is not church membership it's easy it's easy to to fill
