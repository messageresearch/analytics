Gracious heavenly father, we're coming before you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is your time, Lord, that you would have preeminence over this service from the beginning until the end, oh God. Father, Lord, we can already feel your presence in this room because we're about to have church this morning, Father. We cannot have church without you being present. That's why father we invite you that you would have the preeminence that you would have the control that Lord you will capture oh god every spirit oh father anything that is not called upon your name lord god we remove it out of this place in the name of the lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; the only name that is given unto us that all knee shall bow and is in the name of Jesus Christ father that we give you this this momental father may you break the bread of life just the way you always Do father may we recognize that you are here Lord God not to recognize one another or the preacher be behind the pulpit but to recognize you the king of king the lord of lord the one who broke the bread and they recognize then the oh god as the disciple the way of emas they didn't know who was talking to them oh god but the way you broke the bread they recognize that that was you father we asking that this morning may you break oh god the bread in your own manner they will recognize this is not a man that can break such bread.

That's why we are under expectation to receive and to see you, God. bless your word now, oh God, as we have asked these things in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless you once again. &gt;&gt; We'll open our Bibles in the book of of Psalms. Thank you so much, musician. Thank you, brother Lawrence. Psalm chapter 40 46. How many of us are happy to be here? Oh my, you know, it's it's it's it's a privilege to to be in the house of the Lord. You know, &gt;&gt; this morning maybe there's there are many people, you know, &gt;&gt; maybe they had a a long night and maybe drinking and smoking all night &gt;&gt; and this morning they can't show up to church, &gt;&gt; but you are here, &gt;&gt; you know, so it's a blessing. It's a privilege for be here to be here. &gt;&gt; Is that okay if we can all read Psalm chapter 46? All of us together. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Ready? God bless you. You make me feel comfortable. Thank you. I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 46. Psalm 46. If they can project that for us already. To the chief musician for the sons of Kora, the son upon Almouth. Okay, we can read together. God is our refuge and strength, a present help in in trouble. Therefore, will we not fear, though the earth move, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea. Though the water thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with swelling thereof, Silla, there is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacle of the most high. God is in the midst of her. She shall not be removed. God shall help her and that right early. The heathen rage and the kingdom were moved. The all the results and the earth melted. The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Salah. Come behold the works of the Lord. What desolations he has made in the earth. He maketh war to cease unto the end of the earth. He breakth the bow and cutth the spear in thunder. He burneth the chariot in fire. Be still and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the heathen. I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Salah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrew chapter 12. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a powerful scripture there. My goodness. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 12 verse 22. Uh let's let's start at 25. Sorry, I'll start reading at 25 and then you don't have to read. I I'll read myself and we'll go a little faster here. See that you refuse not him that speaketh. That's a present tense. &gt;&gt; For if they escape not who refuse him that speak on earth, how much more shall not we escape? If we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven, still present tense. whose voice then shook the earth, but now he has promised, saying, "Yet once more, a shet not the earth only, but also heaven." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And his word yet once more signifyth the removing of the those things that are shaken as of things that are made. that those things which cannot be shaken &gt;&gt; may remain. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Now verse 28. Wherefore we receiving we receiving &gt;&gt; receiving it's a continuous right? &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; Let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we bow our heads just a few minutes? Lord, now this is your moment. Father, may you have your prayer in us now, Father. &gt;&gt; May you bless us in your presence in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I hope that all of us are doing well. I I want to appreciate brother one uh for giving me the chance to be standing here. &gt;&gt; Uh it's it's a it's it's a great privilege, you know. Uh I just pray that the Lord will help me this morning. &gt;&gt; I have a lot of thoughts uh that the Lord has been min has ministered to me. Uh few I don't know if it was few weeks ago. Uh I think we were just listening to the tape with the family. Every Thursday we listen to it and while we were listening to it, the Lord just gave me a thought. I didn't even know that brother one wanted me to speak. &gt;&gt; So as I'm I was listening to the tape, something just brother Benham says something that just shocked me. I mean I was like, "Oh my goodness, what all of this thing means?" &gt;&gt; Then I just pray about it. I think I was sitting by my wife. I stay quiet. I just took my note. I was just writing things down and and uh tonight I want to speak on born of a kingdom that cannot be moved. Born of a kingdom that cannot be moved. And I would ask you to pay attention. I'll try to slow down. If I go too fast, we're going to miss the point because it is very, very important. I mean, everything in the word of God is important. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; But there are few things that I'm I don't know. I would just probably minister the way God put in my heart and just have your Bible ready because we'll be going back and forth because it's kind of hard for me to preach without the Bible. So, you know, I think it will help me a little bit to go fast here. Now, uh we we just read in the book of uh let's go back to the book of Psalms for a minute here. Psalm 46. You're happy to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So if you know that it's the word, you can say amen. So feel free because when you say amen is so be it. &gt;&gt; You know it's the word of God is not my words. I can only read what the word says. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible begins to say our God is our refuge &gt;&gt; and strength. Right? &gt;&gt; Is a place our God is a place to run to for safety. &gt;&gt; Amen. is a protection from storm and enemies and even avengers of Avengers of blood &gt;&gt; or even danger. Is that right? &gt;&gt; It is a secure place and a a place of safety to be covered. Now in the Old Testament, a place of refuge, there were six cities of refuge. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now six was on one side of the Jordan and six on the other side of the Jordan. So if it happens that you had killed somebody by mistake, you have to run to that city really quick. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because the avenger of blood will come and say, "Oh, this guy had killed my sister or killed my brother." They will come and run after you, right? And if you are innocent, you didn't do it, you know, willingly, you know, it just happened. Then you have to run to that city. And then God had had told Joshua or Moses if I'm not mistaken, you know, to to build those city so that whoever can run to can find refuge there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is our city of refuge. &gt;&gt; He is our servant city of refuge that we can run to. &gt;&gt; He's a place of protection. When the storm of life comes around, we can run to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You see, that's the only place that we can go &gt;&gt; in this hour that we living in. There is not a specific city that we can run to. &gt;&gt; Do we have a city like that? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Because sin is everywhere. &gt;&gt; There's nowhere else to run. &gt;&gt; But you know that you have a king, &gt;&gt; our Lord Jesus Christ that you can run to. &gt;&gt; And now David is saying, can you imagine is a man is seeing he knows the principle of the city of refuge. When he is into the presence of God, he's thinking or say God after I've read about the city of refuge, I found none around me. The only place I can go to is unto you. &gt;&gt; You see, you have to come to that place. You have to come to that conclusion where you look at your father, your mother, your brothers. There's nobody that can help you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But you have to look up. &gt;&gt; That's where your help will come from. &gt;&gt; Don't expect anything from somebody. Look up to God. &gt;&gt; He's the only one who knows what is inside of your heart. &gt;&gt; Even if you do not express it, God knows what is inside of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. And he is your refuge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is your hiding place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is the present help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just the past help. &gt;&gt; He is the present help. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham says something. He says if he is infinite, it cannot be infinite without being omnip omnipotent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he cannot be omnipotent without being omnipresent. &gt;&gt; He cannot be omnipresent without being omnisient. So if God shows up this morning, &gt;&gt; he carries all his power along with him. &gt;&gt; So if you believe that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, &gt;&gt; you must also believe that he can deal with your situation &gt;&gt; because he cannot show up into a place and he say I'm present, but he's not omnipotent. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So once he is present there, he has to show his omnipotence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see sometime we think God is present but yet we like oh no he's not going to do it. No if he is present then ask whatever you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime we put God into a box &gt;&gt; and we go to that box only when we need it. &gt;&gt; But we can create an atmosphere like this morning &gt;&gt; and once he shows up then whatever you need God can give it to you. &gt;&gt; You know brother Brennham will preach is in the midst of the service he says the angel is there. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only thing he's asking people to do is to believe. &gt;&gt; Because if the angel of the Lord is there, whatever you need, God can give it to you. &gt;&gt; Because you are in the presence of the king. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Our God is present. He never been, you know, surprised by any event. &gt;&gt; So there's nothing that happened in your life that God does not know about. &gt;&gt; When something happened to you, you're so frustrated. You're like, "Oh, wow." You know, God, where were you? Does it happen to us? Is that right? &gt;&gt; We question say, "Man, Lord, I was just sleeping. I don't know what happened, &gt;&gt; but you don't realize that he knew that that thing had to happen." &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it would not be God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knows the end before the beginning. So everything that you're going through is not a surprise to him. &gt;&gt; He's not surprised by any event. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what you're going through. &gt;&gt; God knows what you are dealing with. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not surprised. &gt;&gt; He knows the end before the beginning. &gt;&gt; He does not help from far. &gt;&gt; He is near. He's present. &gt;&gt; Right now in your situation, &gt;&gt; in your trial &gt;&gt; is wellproven help &gt;&gt; in time of trouble. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of us believe that? &gt;&gt; You know, you don't just have to say amen. You have to really believe that. &gt;&gt; And after you have believed that, you have to confess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, faith without work is dead. &gt;&gt; To prove your faith from your work. &gt;&gt; So if you truly believe, then confess it with your mouth. &gt;&gt; Then if you confess it with your mouth, go do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That will prove that you believe it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So if you say God will heal me, you believe God, then walk and confess that God has healed you. &gt;&gt; So if you cannot confess, it means that you have not believed there yet. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's as simple as simple can be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So if you believe it, prove it that you believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith is not dead. Faith is in action. &gt;&gt; Faith moves. &gt;&gt; You know, faith has has hair on the chest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Faith is a person. You have to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible continually says, "Do not fear, though the earth be removed. &gt;&gt; The water roar and trouble mountains shake. Even if we see nations have been collapsing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Who have seen it? Maybe you've been in a different planet. &gt;&gt; Those that are on earth knows that there's a lot going on right now. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We can be honest about it. That's okay. &gt;&gt; You know, we having earthquakes that in diverse places, flood, disaster, ches and whatnot. &gt;&gt; And people are fearing, but God is telling you don't fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you have a God. Amen. &gt;&gt; People out there, they do not have a God. &gt;&gt; They're confused. They don't know what happened. &gt;&gt; But you know what happened? &gt;&gt; Because the word said it. &gt;&gt; You will wonder why did God allow all of these things? &gt;&gt; Did if your God was God, why is he allowing all of these things to happen? &gt;&gt; But you as a Christian, you would tell them don't worry about it. My God already said it will happen. &gt;&gt; So I'm not surprised by any event. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? So I should not fear &gt;&gt; because he have already said it &gt;&gt; and I know what will be the next move. &gt;&gt; That's why God has given us the word. &gt;&gt; We should not feed on social media. We should feed on the word because the word tells us what will happen. &gt;&gt; We are not surprised. &gt;&gt; I mean if you are surprised about something that is happening means that you're not reading the word. &gt;&gt; That's true &gt;&gt; because God has said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You should not you should not be shaken. &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's right. &gt;&gt; To us, we were warned of these things that will happen in the world. &gt;&gt; Now, if you watch the Bible, uh it says salah after that, right? &gt;&gt; It's a pause that you might reflect. &gt;&gt; Salah means it's a pause. Stop a little bit and think. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Reflect on what was said. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you see, God is the present help in need. Amen. &gt;&gt; The earth will shake, but you will not shake. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you are shaking, there was something wrong somewhere. &gt;&gt; You're not supposed to be shaking. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be standing and thanking God for what you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Christ. But the B the Bible says something here. If I can continue. Uh though the water there uh uh thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountain shake with swelling thereof, there is a river, the stream where shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacle of the most high. Now the Bible says God is in the midst of her. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; You you catch that? &gt;&gt; So there is a shaking that is happening. &gt;&gt; Yes. But God is in the midst of her. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; She He is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; She shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; God shall help her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And right early, &gt;&gt; Christ is with her. &gt;&gt; Not just with her. &gt;&gt; Christ is in her. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just a God that is around you, &gt;&gt; but a God that is in you. &gt;&gt; So when Christ is in you, &gt;&gt; you cannot fear. &gt;&gt; Because he is in the midst is inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; You see, and she cannot neither be shaken or move. &gt;&gt; She's stable. Yes, &gt;&gt; and that speaks of the gentile bride &gt;&gt; in this last day. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, &gt;&gt; this gentile bride would not move &gt;&gt; because the job has already been done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're talking about a finished work. &gt;&gt; Why are you moving? Why are you tossed about? &gt;&gt; Why are you crying? Speak the word. Because this is a time when the word has to be spoken. &gt;&gt; Don't just say I believe it. Say it with your mouth. &gt;&gt; Confess it. Because we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity. &gt;&gt; You must confess. &gt;&gt; You must profess. &gt;&gt; Is the same thing. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ, she is his temple on earth. Now, &gt;&gt; you are the temple. You are the tabernacle of God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to see the eyes of God, don't look somewhere else. &gt;&gt; There is a body here of the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, the woman that said, "Oh my, I'm going a little off here." The woman that had the the blood issue came to Jesus and touch him. &gt;&gt; Jesus did not even know that that woman will come. &gt;&gt; The Bible says virtue came out of her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of him. Sorry. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Oh, I feel that I'm weak." And Peter says, "There's a lot of people touching you." &gt;&gt; You know what what virtue is? Virtue is power. &gt;&gt; Is strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So somebody that is sick, that's why Paul that that scripture, right, to cut his own clothes and give to the sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you catch that in the book of Acts? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because he got it also from from, you know, they took the body. You know, remember Elijah? &gt;&gt; Yes. the man that was dead that you know the throw is close to the the bone of Elijah and came back to life &gt;&gt; because there were power inside of that bone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you live a life for example if somebody has a need I'm standing here &gt;&gt; you have a need in your heart &gt;&gt; you can't touch God &gt;&gt; and I'll feel weak as I'm standing here &gt;&gt; that it would change my completely my sermon because somebody's inside he has a burden. &gt;&gt; So you're not touching me you're touching the high priest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So my the job of a minister is just to be available. &gt;&gt; You see God want a willing body. &gt;&gt; A willing heart. Somebody that can say God here am I. I'm available. &gt;&gt; So he will use you. He will take you and move you everywhere he wants to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the gift is not to just say things. &gt;&gt; The gift is to know how to yield to him. &gt;&gt; That's what a gift is. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. very important &gt;&gt; and she is a joint hair with him. &gt;&gt; She has the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; She's standing strong and fearless. &gt;&gt; She has dust said the Lord in this age. &gt;&gt; She is the final voice under her messenger. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what our power for this bride is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints, you must come to realize who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the power that is shaking this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even at work, &gt;&gt; people look at you, sister, &gt;&gt; you're living right. &gt;&gt; You are shaking the life. You don't know that. &gt;&gt; But when they look at you and say, "Well, I wish I was that person." &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was something that God has has dropped in your heart that is different. &gt;&gt; It's to let to to let the world know that in this hour we have Christians. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just how we can talk about it, but how can our life reflect Christ? &gt;&gt; In Antioch, they were called Christian because of the way they live. &gt;&gt; They saw how God Jesus was living. They say, "Oh, these ones are Christian." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they could see the way they were talking. Said, "No, no, no. The way they live is different." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The hidden rage, the kingdom were moved. &gt;&gt; There were men in the scripture that tried to mess up with the people of God. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh stood up &gt;&gt; to defile the God of Israel. &gt;&gt; It says, "Who is the Lord that I should obey him? &gt;&gt; What happened to him? &gt;&gt; He was plagued &gt;&gt; with different sickness and pestimy and what not." At the end, death &gt;&gt; and many of his army got drowned. This is a man that is standing against God. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. Wow. &gt;&gt; This is a man standing against the people of God. &gt;&gt; You see, if you are under, if you are following the leadership of God, anybody that touches you touches God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because you are commissioned to fulfill something for this hour. &gt;&gt; So, anybody that will touch you, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; will touch God directly. &gt;&gt; In Egypt, they saw a man called Moses. It was all walking. But yet, if you touch Moses, &gt;&gt; you touch the God of heaven. &gt;&gt; And in this room, there are people that you shouldn't touch. &gt;&gt; If you touch them, you touch God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You must know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody has a right to touch you, saints. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You came from God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God is incomplete without you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; God is incomplete without you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints, let let's stop a little bit here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other nations, you know, they will post somewhere in the billboard, they'll put an animal, for example, a gorilla somewhere there, right? They say if you if you kill that gorilla, you're going to go to prison. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; That gorilla is protected &gt;&gt; by the government. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's just an animal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, God said, "Do not touch my anointed one. You a profit no arm is not a slip of." &gt;&gt; If a government can protect an animal, how much more are you? &gt;&gt; You worth more than an animal, man. &gt;&gt; You are a son and a daughter of God standing in heavenly places &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ. You have to believe that. Say, &gt;&gt; "Oh, glory to God." How many of us believe that? &gt;&gt; You are a son and a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Nobody can touch you. &gt;&gt; Not even Satan can touch you. No demon in hell can touch you. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You are all powerful as your father is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I I was pushing, you know, the stroller with my wife this morning. There was something that shocked me a little bit. I'm pushing the stroller. My wife was behind me and as I'm pushing, you know, and I told Joseph, you say, you know, Joseph was sitting in the front. So I told Joseph, please, Joseph, kick the door so you can't open it. But I was the one pushing. Joseph put his leg like this and he pushed he pushed and the door open. I told my wife, he said, I said, "Joseph push the door means that Joseph did push the door." But the power behind Joseph is not Joseph. &gt;&gt; It's me pushing the stroller. You see, it's the same thing with God. &gt;&gt; God will tell you, "Push the stroller. &gt;&gt; You just put your legs up. You push that door. You kick that door." But the power behind that. Oh, glory to God. It's God Almighty that is pushing. &gt;&gt; You see, when you look everywhere, you see God. &gt;&gt; Even a little stroller. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You are a son of God. You are a daughter of God. You are more than able to speak the word that will come to pass. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible speak of Sinazare, the king of Assyria. He mocked God &gt;&gt; and in the night the angel came and killed all the soldiers. &gt;&gt; It says because this man is trying to defile me. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the God of Israel. You know there are many nation that are destroyed. The God of Egyptians stood up. &gt;&gt; They were not able to solve you to save you. Do you think you Israel will stand before me? The king took that letter said, "Let me go to the temple." &gt;&gt; He went and kneel down. He said, "God, they didn't challenge me. [Music] &gt;&gt; They didn't challenge me. They challenged you, Lord." &gt;&gt; And God stood up. He says to your prophet, he says, "You go tell the king, &gt;&gt; oh, glory to God, I will kill that nation. I'll destroy them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let people challenge your God. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't take it personal. No. &gt;&gt; When somebody step on your toe, don't take a person &gt;&gt; let him do what he does best. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; This man called me, king of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Claim by pride. It says it claimed the glory belonged to him. &gt;&gt; He thought it was somebody. &gt;&gt; He was driven mad for seven years. &gt;&gt; You You don't take the glory. You know, everything that belongs to God belongs to him. Don't mess with that, &gt;&gt; you know. And what about &gt;&gt; Basosar? &gt;&gt; He took of he blasphemed by using the temple vessels, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And say, "Oh, let me have a party with these ones." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; The finger of God came out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And rode on the wall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was a handwriting on the wall. The finger of God, &gt;&gt; the spirit of God was riding on the wall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And that very same night, &gt;&gt; oh yes, &gt;&gt; he died. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We have a powerful God. &gt;&gt; He stands for his people. &gt;&gt; He is faithful. And he said, &gt;&gt; David contin says, &gt;&gt; God altered his voice, the earth melted. &gt;&gt; When God speaks, everything moves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; Everything that was laying dormat in darkness, &gt;&gt; it start coming in position in place. Everything start going back in order. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you something. If there's darkness in your life, let it be light. &gt;&gt; God will bring order. &gt;&gt; He will bring everything in position in order &gt;&gt; by the power of the spoken word. He has already said it. &gt;&gt; But you have to believe it. As soon as you believe it, the action begins &gt;&gt; all the city, everything that was laying dormat in your situation, God start opening doors. You know, you didn't have a job and God start opening doors. You know, you didn't have children, God start opening doors. You didn't have blessing, God start opening the doors. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your children were lost and they start coming to the altar. Said, "No, I don't know what happened." Some God start opening the door because there is a father that is believing. &gt;&gt; God can open your situation tonight. This morning, if you only believe, &gt;&gt; you know, I came here for for a revival. You know, I woke up this morning. I said, "Lord, what do you have? &gt;&gt; I'm I'm here to have church. If you don't want to, I will have it. &gt;&gt; He says, "Be still and know that I am God." &gt;&gt; Don't, in other words, stop fearing, stop fighting, &gt;&gt; stop worrying, &gt;&gt; no means to recognize, &gt;&gt; and to understand is you should be exalted over all nations. &gt;&gt; Be still. &gt;&gt; Send come. Don't shake. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and know, recognize, &gt;&gt; believe, &gt;&gt; get to understand that this God that we had, oh my goodness, he will be the one being exalted &gt;&gt; in the midst of your situation. &gt;&gt; And one day, our Lord was tired on the boat. I haven't even touched my sermon yet. &gt;&gt; It's okay. If I don't touch it, that's okay. He was tired &gt;&gt; after a long sermon. &gt;&gt; He's coming there and his disciple got on board and then you know and Satan looks he said no today I'm going to kill this guy. He's sleeping. He thought he was just a normal man. He of course he was a man &gt;&gt; but a different type of man. &gt;&gt; It was 100% man and 100% God. &gt;&gt; But he was tired. Second look. Oh he's tired like the rest of the common people. &gt;&gt; But they didn't know date was there. The body was sleeping but God was not sleeping. &gt;&gt; You you see that that's the problem that we having. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; The demon comes at night says you know why this man is sleeping. They don't know the dates in me. He's not sleeping. &gt;&gt; There's a wicked standing and the angel of God are there standing ready with the sword. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You must know that there are angel that encampers around you. &gt;&gt; You are here because God did not allow the devil to touch you. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he let loose, he just let his hand, something will happen to you. &gt;&gt; But God says no. &gt;&gt; He He has to be in church today. &gt;&gt; Today is the day. &gt;&gt; He He has to hear these things. &gt;&gt; He has to get this blessing. &gt;&gt; God has to open a certain door for this person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is your day. &gt;&gt; And one day, he was there sleeping. &gt;&gt; When they enter into the boat, he never promised his disciple there's not going to be a storm. Is that right? We're reading the Bible, right? &gt;&gt; Did you tell them, "Oh, be careful. There's going to be a storm. Maybe Satan, you know." &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; The disciples say, "Here we are with the Lord. Let's just get in." &gt;&gt; That's why all of us have come this morning. We're just getting into the boat. You know, &gt;&gt; but we here. &gt;&gt; They went there. &gt;&gt; Got into the boat. He never told them there's going to be a storm in your life. He never told you there's going to be disappointment. &gt;&gt; That's right. He never told you that your children will go away. &gt;&gt; He never told you that your marriage will have a problem. &gt;&gt; When you got married, you know, you get married to your wife, all is well. &gt;&gt; Everything is fine. But he never told you what will happen down the line. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; For those that are getting married, they think like, okay, everything will be just flying ease. No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; There are something that is ahead. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That's true. &gt;&gt; I have the responsibility to say the truth. &gt;&gt; Bless. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; He never promised there's going to be no disappointment, no rejection, no affliction, no sickness, no trials, &gt;&gt; no headache, no challenges. &gt;&gt; He never told you that. &gt;&gt; But he is in the boat. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; That's what matters. &gt;&gt; As long as he's there, that's we talked about being present, right? So if he is present in that boat, then that's a different situation. &gt;&gt; You need to check if Jesus in your boat. That's all. &gt;&gt; So if he is there, don't worry about it. Just do your thing. &gt;&gt; Do your thing. He is your boat. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He has to be in your marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If if he isn't there, don't worry about the sit. It will get dark. But listen, he he is in the boat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In this church, we have to make sure that he is in the church. &gt;&gt; If he is present, the rest of the situation, don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; Keep walking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's good. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The king of glory was in that side of that boat. &gt;&gt; And when trouble came, &gt;&gt; what they had to do is to awaken Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is sleeping. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must just awaken. &gt;&gt; Because your situation will never change. &gt;&gt; Until you awaken. &gt;&gt; You see the first point, make sure he is in the boat. Amen. &gt;&gt; But go and wake him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go and say, "Hey, Jesus, we're going to die. Please wake up." &gt;&gt; Now, they were sleeping. &gt;&gt; Then he spoke to the storm. &gt;&gt; You see that part of God there? &gt;&gt; Spoke to the storm. &gt;&gt; Do you know that that what was in Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Everything that was in Jesus Christ, let me put it that way. &gt;&gt; Is inside of his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that a word? &gt;&gt; Is that a word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other word, &gt;&gt; deity &gt;&gt; is not in heaven. now &gt;&gt; is in the midst of his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The true believer, &gt;&gt; filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; have dat. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I feel like there are some people that not believing this. &gt;&gt; This is the word. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Ye are gods. That's the only thing I can I can't give you many. Let me help you with that one. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; My my my &gt;&gt; good. &gt;&gt; The one that is inside of you &gt;&gt; is the one that created the heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; All the galaxies. &gt;&gt; Because God works in humility. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that's one of the principle you must know about our God. When we pray God we think like oh my goodness it's big. &gt;&gt; He can actually condescend himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can. The brother says God has the desire &gt;&gt; to even to dwell inside of the worst prostitute in town. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch this. &gt;&gt; God want is somebody's heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. that is willing to condescend as low as men &gt;&gt; to say I want to save you &gt;&gt; and I'm going to live glory &gt;&gt; everything and I will come down and say I want to come into your heart &gt;&gt; if tonight this morning you have the desire to receive the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; it's not just your desire &gt;&gt; God want to enter &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; he has promis He want to get inside of your heart. Even if you don't want it, he's after you. I want to give you that Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; But you just have to ask him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Psalm 33:6, the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; By the word of the Lord were the heavens, and the host of them by the breath of go of the of his mouth. He gathered the waters of the sea together. As a heap, he laid up the deep in the storehouse. Let all the earth fear the Lord. Let all the inhabitants of the the world stand in awe of him. &gt;&gt; He spake and it was done. &gt;&gt; He commanded and he stood fast. &gt;&gt; The Lord bringeth the counsel of the hidden to not. He maketh the device of the people of none effect. &gt;&gt; The counsel of the Lord shall stand forever. &gt;&gt; The thought of his heart to all generations. &gt;&gt; So if God taught it, &gt;&gt; Amen. My prophet said it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; God thought must be expressed. What is the word of God? Is the thought expressed? &gt;&gt; So if you were part of him in his thought, &gt;&gt; what do you expect? You're going to be here. &gt;&gt; You would do what he intended you to do when you were yet in his thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you are believing the word of God today means there in his mind he knew that you will believe it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Saint this is the power of this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If God did not send a prophet we'll be in confusion. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; We must come to that place to realize &gt;&gt; that our God is able. &gt;&gt; So my word Isaiah 55 11. Oh, &gt;&gt; so my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me void, &gt;&gt; it shall accomplish that which I please, and shall prosper in the things there to sent it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word of God, you know, in the book of Psalms here, even Hebrew chapter 4, it says the word, Hebrew 4:12, for the word of God is quicker and powerful, &gt;&gt; that and sharper than any two-edged sword, &gt;&gt; pursing even to the dividing ascent of the soul and spirit, &gt;&gt; and the join and marrow, and is the discerner. It's a discerner &gt;&gt; of the thoughts and intent of the heart. &gt;&gt; So even if you have an intention, &gt;&gt; the word of God can go deep inside of your heart and deal with that situation. &gt;&gt; Maybe you have done something in secret that nobody knows about. &gt;&gt; When the word of God comes in the pulpit, it goes down there into that that area that you're trying to hide. Nobody knows about it. I'm gonna die with this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God can go that deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can hide things from one another, but the word of God &gt;&gt; can go deep into that area. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saint, I want you to catch this because we're going to go in that area this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we might actually miss heaven &gt;&gt; because of that little tiny little bitty little thing &gt;&gt; that is there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're going to dig inside &gt;&gt; just for by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Eden, God gave men his word. It was his safety. The Bible says in Proverbs say, "Every word of God is pure. &gt;&gt; He is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. In Eden, God gave them the word. &gt;&gt; We just read it. Is that right? &gt;&gt; God gave them the word. It says, "Out of all the tree, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's only a tree there you should not eat." Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, the word of God was a safety boundary. &gt;&gt; You see, it's a place where you are protected. It's like your children. You keep them on the fence, right? Just making sure that they don't go outside. As long as they were there, nothing could happen to them. &gt;&gt; But Satan came in their midst, that serpent came. The serpent is, how many of us know that the serpent was an upright beast? &gt;&gt; It could speak, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It could talk. For the matter of fact, it could have children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we message believers? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Because if we go deeper, I don't want to slow down and start looking at the scriptures, but we're not going to we're going to waste time here. &gt;&gt; Uh, brother, can you give me Genesis chapter 2:15? And the Lord took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded men, saying, "Every tree of the garden, thou may freely eat, but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat it." Is that right? &gt;&gt; Is it clear? Right? &gt;&gt; God says, "Do not eat it." &gt;&gt; You can eat all all of them. There's a lot of them. There were four kinds, right? Good for the eyes, good for food, the tree of life, &gt;&gt; and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; You can read it. I won't have time to read it. It's there. But the enemy came because this enemy that came into the saints, don't don't miss this. Very important, please. Somebody is sleeping, you shake them, and say, "Hey, something it's happening." &gt;&gt; Now, God told them not to eat. He says, "The day that you eat it, you will die." &gt;&gt; And Satan came and took that body, the body of that beast, &gt;&gt; because Lucifer was the one that was in heaven. Is that right? cast down because of disobedience. Right? Came on earth but his spirit. &gt;&gt; He has to find a body. &gt;&gt; He cannot dwell in a man. He has to use a beast. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Very important principle there. &gt;&gt; Satan uses a beast to enter. &gt;&gt; Very important. That's why they went into, you know, when the the spirits were cast out of the men from Gad Gadara, &gt;&gt; they went into the &gt;&gt; the swines. go sat and laugh love to enter into animals. If you need a quote, I can send it to you. Brother said &gt;&gt; when he came in the garden of Eden, watch this. He never forced them. I want you to catch this. This is the way Satan comes. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm digging into things that we must understand. &gt;&gt; God Satan, sorry, let me put this. Satan does not force you. &gt;&gt; That's the first element you should know about Satan. &gt;&gt; He did not force Eve, &gt;&gt; but he only twisted the word. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to catch this. Satan can just twist something &gt;&gt; and he already gotten you. That's it. &gt;&gt; Let's read it together here. &gt;&gt; He did not force her. He used deception &gt;&gt; to cause Eve to reason with what God said. &gt;&gt; God said, "You shall not eat. &gt;&gt; It's clear." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But watch one element here. Deception. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis chapter 31. How many of us are happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Please don't you shouldn't we shouldn't sleep. If you have your Bible, you know, let I think it's good also for all the young people, all of us, you know, we need to catch this. I think as I was reading it was a blessing to me. Now the serpent was the most subtle &gt;&gt; than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. &gt;&gt; I'm going to focus on this word here. &gt;&gt; Sar means shrewd, conning. &gt;&gt; Having a certain wisdom, smart, crafty. In other words, brother Benham says in Hebrew they use the word maha in Hebrew. Maha you can read it in the message the serpent seed. But Benham says something. He says maha means having a true knowledge of the principles of life. &gt;&gt; Can I continue again? &gt;&gt; I'll repeat it again. a having a true knowledge of the principle of life. So he knows how life goes. &gt;&gt; He knows how the body of a woman is. He knows how the body of man is. He knows all of that. He knows that. He knows the principle of life. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said unto the woman, "Yay, as God said." You see something wrong there? &gt;&gt; God had already said something. &gt;&gt; Is somebody catching this? &gt;&gt; Are we reading it together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Has God said, can you imagine you're standing in front of somebody, they already told you something, &gt;&gt; but did you really No, you heard me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Has God said, "Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden." That's it. That's the only conversation you had. &gt;&gt; The woman said unto the serpent, "Yeah, we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden, but the fruit of of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God said, you shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest we die. Is that a scripture? &gt;&gt; Is it what God said? &gt;&gt; For the matter of fact, &gt;&gt; when Eve said it, God told Adam, God told the man of this commandment. &gt;&gt; So if Eve was able to quote that to the serpent, means that she might have heard it from Adam. From the &gt;&gt; Did she quote the scripture? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But watch say that. And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye shall not surely die." That's it. So N is the only thing. God said that that you said that to that totally different. &gt;&gt; He didn't say that. He did not say that you shall not surely die. He said, "You shall show me that." &gt;&gt; That's what God said. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So when the enemy comes, &gt;&gt; don't allow him to reason with you. &gt;&gt; You just tell him what the word said and walk away. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But as soon as you start thinking, "Oh, really?" &gt;&gt; Did he really mean it? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Because at that moment, you reasoning with the word &gt;&gt; and that's what Eve did. She reasoned the day she opened her ear. &gt;&gt; She reasoned with the word and then that was it. &gt;&gt; For God doeth no that in the day he eats thereof. Now he adds a little bit more &gt;&gt; in a formation that was not what God gave them because you you you actually inject a certain wisdom and then wait the person start reasoning you stop adding information &gt;&gt; then what God did not say. [Music] &gt;&gt; Can we continue? For God knoweth that in the day you eat there off, &gt;&gt; then your eyes shall be open, &gt;&gt; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil, &gt;&gt; but they were already gods. &gt;&gt; So once you don't know who you are, &gt;&gt; that's it. So you are a Christian, the devil come and say, "Are you really a Christian?" &gt;&gt; You start thinking and say, "Whoa, I was a Christian before the foundation of the world." &gt;&gt; You must know who you are. &gt;&gt; They were already there. &gt;&gt; But Satan had an information that was not even needed. &gt;&gt; And that's where Eve dropped all the barrier and Satan came in. Now I want you to catch this certain wisdom &gt;&gt; how it works before I stop flying a little fast. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; How many of us love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Six. When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, now you need to watch the language here. It was not an apple. Let me say it from the beginning. The here you will say, "Oh, brother, but it says good for food." There were four kinds of trees in the garden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if you watch that trend, you'll figure it out why. Because the Bible says it's like a way of an adulterous woman. &gt;&gt; She eatth and say and wipe her mouth and say I have not eaten. &gt;&gt; So that eating that eating is not the eating of food. &gt;&gt; That's what we need in Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Now and that was pleasant to the eye. Watch this. and a tree to be desired to make one what? &gt;&gt; Wise. &gt;&gt; That wisdom is not God wisdom. &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham says those three elements was the three assaults &gt;&gt; that Jesus encountered in ma in Matthew chapter 4. &gt;&gt; Satan brought him this very same three things. You know how Jesus overcome it? By the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see you you catching this? &gt;&gt; Maybe down the line we'll talk about that. But let's go to the book of James. James chapter 3:15. &gt;&gt; I need to go faster, right? Otherwise, we'll sleep here. James 3:15. The the wisdom descendeth not from above, &gt;&gt; but but is earthly, &gt;&gt; sensual. &gt;&gt; Use this word very carefully here. &gt;&gt; Sensual and devilish. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the wisdom of Satan &gt;&gt; is to to to begal you. &gt;&gt; Now watch when God came down and said what what did you guys do? Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; If said the serpent begal me. &gt;&gt; That word begal means to lure to seduce. &gt;&gt; How can you seduce something to eat fruit? God wisdom is to stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Satan wisdom is to twist it to make it say something that he does not say. &gt;&gt; Anything that is not part of God original thought is a perversion. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Satan does not create. You have to understand these principles. &gt;&gt; Satan does not create. He cannot create otherwise you'll be God. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I want to enter into something I'm going to hold myself. &gt;&gt; So, Satan does not create. &gt;&gt; He only perverts what God creates. &gt;&gt; You know that Satan and Lucif God and and Lucifer were very close, right? &gt;&gt; The but the Bible says the only thing was that Lucifer could not create. &gt;&gt; They were very close. But the only element there was creation. &gt;&gt; I can't go deep into that, but I I'll hold it. &gt;&gt; Sin is a perver perversion of righteousness. &gt;&gt; What is adultery? Is a perversion of the right act. &gt;&gt; What is a lie? &gt;&gt; Is the truth &gt;&gt; perverted? &gt;&gt; Amen. So everything that you see here, it's a perversion of something else &gt;&gt; of the original one. &gt;&gt; Satan cannot create, but he can only twist and pervert it. &gt;&gt; And if he perverts it, then your mind goes there and you start going crazy. &gt;&gt; And out of that union between Eve and the serpent came out Cain. Let's go to first John chapter 3:15. Not as Cain, who was No, let's let's read it first. Amen. We can go faster. So we we go faster here. Okay. First John chapter 3:15. First John 3:15. Is that right? 1 John 3:15. Maybe first John 3 oh sorry twow 15 I say 15 so it's 12 here not as king who was of what &gt;&gt; that wicked one &gt;&gt; that slew his brother wherefore slew he him because his own work were evil and his brother righteousness The Bible says here it was of that wicked one. &gt;&gt; That wicked one was not him. &gt;&gt; The first quote exposition of the church age. The first quote there. Did you get it? Now these are two twins again. These are two trees again growing side by side in the earth. the same earth, partaking of the same nourishment, drinking in in some rain and beneficiaring by the by the same son, but they come from a different seed. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; One tree is for the word of from the for the word of God and exactly as God gave it. Love and obey it. The other tree is from the seed of the enter the word of God and change it where he wants you. He substituted his own creed and dogma for living true for living the true word of of God exactly as Cain and did Cain rather who ended up killing Abel. But fear not little flock. Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear not little flock. Stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Keep that word between you what? And the devil. &gt;&gt; If did not do that she failed. And when the church let down on the word, &gt;&gt; she goes into the depths of darkness of what? Of Satan. &gt;&gt; Every time that we go away, we think we reason. That's it. We under the control of Satan. &gt;&gt; The Bible says 1 Corinthians chapter 1:20, "Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the dispute of the world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?" It contin after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew him not know knew not God he pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 3:15. Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in the world, let him become a fool &gt;&gt; that he may be wise. The wisdom of this world, watch this, the wisdom of this world is foolish, foolishness with God. &gt;&gt; For it is written, it taketh the wise in their own craft craftiness. And again, the Lord knoweth the thought or what of the wise, and they are vain. &gt;&gt; You hear people say, "Wow, I'm very smart. I'm very wise." But after that from that union came out Cain right Genesis 2:15 God told Adam to tilt the soil right you can find it there &gt;&gt; is to cultivate it right and you would watch that in the action of Adam his seed would do the same thing you know Seth will also you know kind of get it into agriculture right and of course still having you know in civilization of faith in terms of like they will believe God like Abel did. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But of Cain they chose something quite different in Genesis chapter 4:15 4:16 and Cain after he had killed Abel Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nad and the east of Eden and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and be Anosh and he built a city. So from the lineage of Seth we have agriculture. They focus more on agriculture. They were more on the agricultural civilization. On the other side of of of Cain they were building buildings. You see that &gt;&gt; that's actually approximately 2,000 years getting closer to Noah. Are you are you with me? &gt;&gt; Oh no. I mean after Adam. So we can't tr first in Genesis chapter 4:16. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Cain went out of the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod. I think I just read it. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Verse 17 now. &gt;&gt; And Cain knew his wife. Oh, I think let's go to 18. &gt;&gt; And unto Okay, let me read it. Unto Anoch was born Aaron. And Aaron begat Jehel. And Jeera began Mashusel. And Mashus beg Lamech. Right. Continue. &gt;&gt; And Lamech took unto him to wife. This is the introduction of polygamy. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my. &gt;&gt; It's not coming from the lineage of God people. &gt;&gt; This is coming from the children of of Cain &gt;&gt; because it's the guy who introduced polygamy here. &gt;&gt; Lamech took unto him two wives. The name of one was Adam and the name of the other was Zilah. Let's continue. And and Adam bomb. He was the father of such as dwelt in tent and such as of cattle. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And his brother's name was Juba. He was the father of all such of what handle the AR and the organ. So all the musicians because the first one was more into business the stuff like that. This one is showing up with music and stuff. My goodness. Let's continue. And Zilla, she also bear tuba king an structure of all of every artificial in brass and iron. &gt;&gt; You you catch this right? &gt;&gt; Let's continue. And the sister to was uh toain was uh nema. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now you see from the lineage of Seth, the more into agriculture. Is that right? &gt;&gt; No. because Adam was tilted the soil and all of it. In the other side, we having men that are more into, hey, let's build city, &gt;&gt; let's build towers, let's do this artificial music and all. You watch that. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to trace every line of both of them separately. &gt;&gt; Because we're getting somewhere. &gt;&gt; It will trace. It will bring us to today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz the Bible does not lie. &gt;&gt; You know, I was reading this. I was sitting there say, "Oh my goodness, Lord, help me today. Let's read the message the ark. Brother says this. But if you notice, there come a great civilization through that what? The lineage of what? Of Cain. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Back there that begin to come in. And when the men begin to multiply, they begin to go out after different education and so forth and discover the things what inventions. one great worker of wood. How they build big build uh begin to build and build and build and build that I mean was a sign of what? &gt;&gt; Of the end time. &gt;&gt; All of these things was the sign of the end time. &gt;&gt; So when you see city cities being built and all of it, it's a sign. &gt;&gt; Is that a prophet? Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you ever see like a building that got now it's again the sign of what the end time &gt;&gt; they got great work of metals they discovered how they could and what they could do with metals. This was before the unto the living destruction. &gt;&gt; So sometime we have big building we think like we got it. No, &gt;&gt; before &gt;&gt; before the destruction or before the flood, &gt;&gt; these people were even stronger than us. &gt;&gt; They had more technology that we got. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's continue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. See &gt;&gt; the next paragraph. Let's continue. Yes. And look what they're doing with the metal today. Even making I heard on the radio the other day making steel and metal houses. They cut all the timber practically so that they make them out of aluminum and and of steel and and so forth. Great discoveries of education and great going of science, progress of science, a sign of the end time. &gt;&gt; Look what science has done in the last few years. Just the things that they done. What is it? Nearing the end time. A sign that that all believer watch this. That's when the minister come around. &gt;&gt; Minister in the pulpit should be preaching it with all force &gt;&gt; they got showing to the people. &gt;&gt; You see we have a responsibility &gt;&gt; showing to the people we are passing milestone &gt;&gt; and all things point to the end. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. So everything that we dealing with with everything that we did it's not new. &gt;&gt; The civilization before the flood was highly advanced. &gt;&gt; The they might have harnessed atomic and electrostatic energy in a destructive way. Say I'm an engineer. I think if we have engineers in in in the room right now we'll figure it out. That's true. So if you have metal, you have all of these things is easy easy to make an atomic bomb. &gt;&gt; How they were able to make pyramid &gt;&gt; sphinxes how they were able to do it but we cannot do it today. &gt;&gt; They they had atomic power to do it. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham talks about it. Let's read it. &gt;&gt; Perseverance. It says Noah was living in a scientific age when the world was perhaps could shoot the moon with a rod with radar. &gt;&gt; Is it a prophet? &gt;&gt; Is it a prophet? &gt;&gt; Do you believe the prophet? Right. &gt;&gt; Here it is. It says Jesus said it was a day like this. &gt;&gt; As it was in the day what? Of Noah. &gt;&gt; So shall it be in the coming of what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Referring to what? this time. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now we know down in Egypt we see the pyramid. They could not reproduce them today. We have no power to do that. &gt;&gt; They had a hold of what? Atomic power &gt;&gt; or something of power that building you know built the pyramid. We could put those border up there by no mean neither could we produce that fixes. There is no way to do in of doing it. We don't have the material to make a mommy on ball a body that will look even natural for thousands of years. &gt;&gt; Do you see that &gt;&gt; we've lost that art? &gt;&gt; They die that won't fade out. Many things that they had then that we are are completely blind off and they build that pyramid so sitting so scented in the earth no matter where the sun is there is is never a shadow around it. Is that right? How many of us have ever seen a pyramid? &gt;&gt; Hey, nobody have seen the pyramid. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm talking even in the picture, you know. &gt;&gt; Come on, people. You know, at least at least at least in the picture, brother. Cuz everybody went quiet. I'm like, &gt;&gt; all right. That's a good one. &gt;&gt; Oh my my Where was I? &gt;&gt; Right here. Right. Oh, the art that &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Thank you. The instrument they had is far beyond now. Is that right? &gt;&gt; People had abused knowledge and power. &gt;&gt; That might have caused the shift of the some techni tectonic plates that caused the flood &gt;&gt; because from Adam, if you calculate to Noah approximately is 2,000 years ago. 2,000 years and every 2,000 years there is something major that has to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And people had become so smart that destruction &gt;&gt; was right there. They stopped playing. But the Bible even says men stop playing in God laboratory. &gt;&gt; They start doing things to destroy themsel. &gt;&gt; So you see what is happening today. It's not a new saint. &gt;&gt; Look at the evasion. Look at whatever people are digging oil and all of these things &gt;&gt; there is it's it's un it's bringing destruction in the earth. You don't even know &gt;&gt; we are at the end saints &gt;&gt; the world is falling apart. &gt;&gt; If you don't know that the world is falling apart &gt;&gt; everything around us are falling apart. &gt;&gt; That's why we must seek a kingdom that cannot be shaken. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that's my title. Now, &gt;&gt; we must receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken &gt;&gt; because everything is shaking. &gt;&gt; In the time of Noah, everything was shaking. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In another quote here birth pain people's science has brought into a great laboratory into God's great laboratory until they are going to destroy what themselves. &gt;&gt; God let always let wisdom destroy himself. &gt;&gt; God does not destroy anything. &gt;&gt; It says men destroy himself by what? Wisdom. And that wisdom is not of God. &gt;&gt; Is the work of Satan &gt;&gt; So if Cain had the seed of Satan in him, he had to produce the very thing that was Satan &gt;&gt; of Satan &gt;&gt; which include destruction. &gt;&gt; As he did what? &gt;&gt; Taking Satan wisdom instead of what? &gt;&gt; Can you see that? the world falling apart. When the world is falling apart in the time of Noah, God sent them a what? A mighty prophet. &gt;&gt; What did it do? They turned it down. &gt;&gt; So what the end was coming, God sent them Noah. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God sent them Noah with a message, &gt;&gt; but they turned it down. God can do nothing &gt;&gt; without revealing his secret &gt;&gt; to his servant the prophet &gt;&gt; Amos chapter 3:7 &gt;&gt; and the Lord you know 1st Samuel 3:21 if we can post that that scripture really helped me 1st Samuel 3:21st Samuel 3:21 the Lord at watch This &gt;&gt; the Lord appeared again in Shiloh. You see that? &gt;&gt; For the Lord revealed himself. Watch this. The For the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh &gt;&gt; by the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you catching this? So God gives his word to a prophet. &gt;&gt; He reveal himself by the word to a prophet and the prophet has to speak the word to the people. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing that? &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh in Jesus. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And I'm bringing another principle here. John chapter 1. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was what? Was God. And John 1 verse 15 14 the word was made flesh in Jesus. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now if you you notice Jesus as he was coming to John John the Baptist &gt;&gt; the word which was Jesus in flesh &gt;&gt; had to go to a prophet. Now watch let's read it together. Matthew chapter 3:15. Then come Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized. But John for forbade him saying, I I have need to be baptized of thee. &gt;&gt; Cometh thou to me? Okay. And cometh thou to me as a question, right? And Jesus answering said unto him, suffer it not to be so. For thus it cometh becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. &gt;&gt; The word that was the word that was made flesh &gt;&gt; had to come to a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You you got that principle &gt;&gt; is the same principle. &gt;&gt; The word of God comes to a prophet to fulfill all righteousness. &gt;&gt; And here you watch this. Jesus come John says no you are the one that need to baptize me. Jesus says no, he can't break the word. &gt;&gt; The word must come to a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So s is the same thing the revealed word for this day. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the word made flesh had to come to you. &gt;&gt; He had to come had to be revealed to a prophet and the prophet had to speak the word. &gt;&gt; It's the same principle. &gt;&gt; It's the same principle. The word comes only to a prophet, &gt;&gt; not to an evangelist or a pastor or anybody. &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord for such age as this &gt;&gt; only come to a prophet. &gt;&gt; You see somebody say, "Oh, you know, I don't need a prophet. I can just read the Bible myself." How can you understand this Bible with a prophet? You cannot understand because the a prophet is an interpreter of a divine word of God. &gt;&gt; He looks at the word it tells you what happened. &gt;&gt; You say but how is it? He says no. For example, you come and say the Bible says Eve was there. Adam was there when Eve ate the fruit. Right? But the bottom says Adam was not there &gt;&gt; because in the morning Eve went with the serpent &gt;&gt; and the evening he went with your husband. &gt;&gt; Only a prophet can see that &gt;&gt; said we are privileged in this time that we living in. &gt;&gt; That's why we should feed on the word of God. &gt;&gt; It will solve all our problems around. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go chapter six. Remember every falling generation. &gt;&gt; Let me let me continue that quote I was reading. The word of the Lord comes to a prophet is the word of God. Again in the time of Noah they sent it. Moses time the whole system was falling apart. They sent a prophet and Elijah in his time the whole system was falling apart. They send a prophet every time when the word the world catch this get into the into disguise they send a prophet. God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And the next quote six it says remember every falling generation there's only one thing that God can bridge this world together. Bridge this world together. Is that right? &gt;&gt; He says that's the word of God. It continues. It says, "This word was made by the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's framed together by the word of God." That's the only thing that will ever keep it together is the word of God. For the Hebrews said, "We understand that the world will frame by the word of God." People doubt the word of God and the very the very dirt that you are sitting on &gt;&gt; is the word of God made manifest. &gt;&gt; The very seat that you are sitting in is the word of God made manifest. &gt;&gt; God speak it and then it has to happen because it is the word of God. Even the the the the wood that you're sitting on, the chair, &gt;&gt; God spoke it, &gt;&gt; are you with me? Everything that is around us, &gt;&gt; it was framed by the word of God. So we should not sit and question the word of God. &gt;&gt; The following God gift always find a place. &gt;&gt; The whole creation was lost and we just went through in the seven seals. See, the whole creation was lost. Everything was gone. He all belong to Satan. But he's talking now. &gt;&gt; It says he fell. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because Yeah. Let me let me because the same quote but it continues here. It says every government, every king, every kingdom controlled by Satan. The whole world is controlled and run by Satan. Let me continue here. says every person that works in it &gt;&gt; maybe we say oh wow our government you know man this government will be better you know how we do in Africa for instance we expecting the nef government to come and we say wow things will get better watch what the prophet is saying politics corrupted democrat republican and all is low down what it is it's a bunch of craft every person that works in it &gt;&gt; that's not born again &gt;&gt; is of the devil. &gt;&gt; Are you you saying &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; The devil says every kingdom in the world belong to me. &gt;&gt; And Jesus never debate him with it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; The word is controlled by what? The devil. And every man that works for the government, if he isn't a Christian, &gt;&gt; it's of the devil and working for the devil. Is that the word of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we must be very careful. &gt;&gt; And the people come, let me drop into something here. The level of corruption in the time of Noah. &gt;&gt; Genesis 6:5. And God saw the weakness of men was great in the earth that every imagination of the thought of the heart was only evil continually. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, the deprivation, the the depravity, the intent of the thoughts &gt;&gt; were evil, the imagination, the purpose, the desire. Sin was no longer occasional, occasional. It was constant. It had become the way of life. And what is sin? Sin is just means missing the mark. &gt;&gt; It's unbelief. People's heart, imagination, desire will feel full of violence, lust, greed and all rebellious before God. &gt;&gt; You see everything that we seeing on the street now, killing and all of it's not new. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said as he was in the time of Noah, so shall it be. Is that right? And that's what we're seeing. Let's go to Genesis chapter 6:2. The sons of God, watch this. We're getting to something here now. We we talked about the world in terms of the earth and all how men is destructing destroying themselves through technology and whatnot. Is that right? We talked about you know uh the corruption as well right &gt;&gt; the mind of men. Now let's dig about this. The sons of God in other words the sons of Seth. &gt;&gt; Now we coming to a place where God said enough is enough. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The son from the lineage of Seth, not from Cain. &gt;&gt; From the lineage of Seth took the daughter of men. Brother says they took the the daughter of Cain. &gt;&gt; The sons of God &gt;&gt; took the daughter of men that they were fair. They're like beautiful woman. Brother Benam, another message says that's a proof of the end too. &gt;&gt; The beauty. Everybody want to be beautiful. &gt;&gt; Now we going on the street. There's a lot of paint in the face everywhere. &gt;&gt; Oh, am I saying something wrong here? &gt;&gt; Is it Is it not true? &gt;&gt; Because that's a spirit of Jezebel. &gt;&gt; That's a spirit of Jezebel. She's the one that's a hidden thing. &gt;&gt; That's for another day. Now the sons of the lineage of Ken took the woman started living with them. Are we now seeing it today? &gt;&gt; Sons of God, Christians, they will go and say, "Wow, I see this beautiful woman. Maybe not marry them, just live with them. This is the son of the end." Saints, if nobody tells us these things, tell us these things, we're not we're going to leave any type of way. &gt;&gt; But this is the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From this pulpit, the truth must come out. &gt;&gt; And I don't think brother one compromise. &gt;&gt; Why would I do it? &gt;&gt; Say that's why we have to repent. &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us. &gt;&gt; If he those one did not escape, we will not escape. Is that right? Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; It's not to condemn anybody. It's just that God need to help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the church of the living God, even as we standing together, praying together &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, help me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we must pray for one another. You don't know what your brother is dealing with. &gt;&gt; You don't know what your sister's dealing with, pray for her. &gt;&gt; Don't just wait for somebody to happen, then you start, "Oh, wow. Why did he can do why are they doing this?" &gt;&gt; But we spend time to pray for them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the end is coming. You don't want this situation to happen, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There is something that really caught my attention here. You would watch when Noah because when Noah entered into the ark, there were only eight people that were saved. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But you would wonder where are all the sons of Sad? &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; Are you catching this? &gt;&gt; And I was just reading. I thought about it. I said, "Whoa, &gt;&gt; what about all the lage of the sons of &gt;&gt; Seth?" &gt;&gt; Only eight. &gt;&gt; That shocked me just for a minute. &gt;&gt; You can say I'm a Christian, &gt;&gt; but how many of us &gt;&gt; will be there? That's why saint where we come into church &gt;&gt; is because we need more of God. It has to be a relationship. &gt;&gt; Say Lord please help me. &gt;&gt; You crying every day Lord I don't want to miss that day. Not out of fear &gt;&gt; but to do something for me. You know you have love for God. You don't want to hurt his feeling. &gt;&gt; Only eight were able to make it. My my my Lord have mercy on us. &gt;&gt; You know, before Noah, it never rained before. Is that right? How many of us believe that? &gt;&gt; Genesis 2:5, we can read it. &gt;&gt; No rain before and after that it rained. The Bible says in Genesis chapter 7:11, in the 600 years of Noah's life, the second month, the 17th day of the month, the same day where all the fountain of the deep broke up &gt;&gt; and the windows of heaven were open, may rain crazy. Fellowship the message fellowship. I'm coming to to close. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord here? &gt;&gt; May God help us. Right. All of us need God's help. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Uh quotes number nine. I'm coming there so we can finish here. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. There's a lot going on here. All right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's no nine. Put nine, please. Oh, there's no nine. Oh, that's fine. There's only 10 there. Okay, that's fine. I'll read nine. It says, "Now, I'll say it as a servant." But what I'm saying here, I'll say as a servant of the Lord, I believe that it could happen at any time. &gt;&gt; Total annihilation. &gt;&gt; It could start at any time. Look as in the day of Noah. That's how they throw the world out of it bound in the days of Noah when they built pyramid and fences and and so forth. They couldn't build it today if we had to. Gasoline power, electric power won't build it. You see that? &gt;&gt; But I'm saying but says but atomic power will &gt;&gt; but we don't have atomic power. But in that time they were able to have it. &gt;&gt; Did you see that? &gt;&gt; So they could turn it loose. What? What? What am I saying? My It says they could turn it loose and suck the world from its orbit and it begins went out and caused moisture. Brother Benham is telling us what had caused &gt;&gt; the flood. You know, I went down and studied this a little bit because I love stuff like this. So, I went to study figure it out. How was it posit possible? I came out to find out. Yes, brother is right. &gt;&gt; I don't want to get into it, &gt;&gt; but he was right. &gt;&gt; Let me continue. It says, "And I hated moisture that covered the whole earth." He says, "This time is going to blow it into the sun." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Just exactly scientifically, right across the center, the way God said it, it would happen. Here it is. We are at the the end time and men are still unprepared. Saint, as we sitting here this morning, there's triggers of atomic bomb in people's head. &gt;&gt; Maybe we sitting here, we're worshiping. &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot of things happening around the world. &gt;&gt; It will just take one person to press a button. &gt;&gt; But for you, &gt;&gt; you are promising. The world can shake in destruction, &gt;&gt; but you cannot shake &gt;&gt; because you are born, we'll get into it. You are born into that kingdom &gt;&gt; that before anything could happen, the Lord will take you home. &gt;&gt; God would not allow his elect to go through such things. &gt;&gt; But I'm glad to say when the world was shaking, there was a man called Enoch. &gt;&gt; He was the seventh from Adam. He was raptured. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, you know, the Bible says Enoch walked with God and he was not. And God took him &gt;&gt; by faith. Enoch was translated that he should not what? See death and was not found because God has translated him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For before his translation, he had this testimony that he pleased God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Enoch was the seventh. But the but the one was reading here. Watch the seven. &gt;&gt; You catch this. &gt;&gt; The seven need to take be taken home. &gt;&gt; The promise of the right is for the bride. &gt;&gt; Soon enough here she'll go home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the time of the bride. She she isn't a civilization of faith. &gt;&gt; She believe our work the whole word of God. &gt;&gt; She's not shaken. Is that right? &gt;&gt; If God decide for you to die here in a moment in the twilling of the eye &gt;&gt; at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound &gt;&gt; and the death shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be what? Changed &gt;&gt; is that right? &gt;&gt; For the corruptible must put on a corruption and the mortal must put on immortality. So when the corruptible shall have to put on a corrupt or even corruption. This model shall have to put on immortality &gt;&gt; and then shall &gt;&gt; to pass the saying that is written, &gt;&gt; death is swallowed up in victory. &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians 4:16, &gt;&gt; for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout. What is the shout? The message. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The message is coming forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. has come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the voice of the archangel, with the trump of God, the death in in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain. &gt;&gt; Shall be caught up together with them in the cloud to meet the Lord in the air. So shall we ever be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a promise that belong to you. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:26, &gt;&gt; as it was in the day of Noah, so shall it be in the day of the son of man. &gt;&gt; They did eat the drunk and the merry wives. &gt;&gt; You see that &gt;&gt; the merry wives, they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered to the ark, the flood came and destro wife, destroyed them all. Likewise also. I like that. &gt;&gt; Likewise. &gt;&gt; It looks like the sim the similar thing, right? &gt;&gt; But it's there for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Likewise also it as it was in the day of Lot. &gt;&gt; What happened in the time of Lot? Perversion. &gt;&gt; Is it not what we seeing? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; They did eat. They drunk. They they bought and and sold it. They planted. They build it. Let's continue. But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, he rained fire and bring storm from heaven and destroyed them all. &gt;&gt; So if God does not bring destruction for this generation, he has to go back and repent for this. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But God cannot repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. When brother Brennham was preaching I think did the choosing of the bride if I'm not mistaken he spoke about Los Angeles &gt;&gt; said do you remember Pompe India what happened there he says you Los Angeles you go down in the sea saint we living in the time &gt;&gt; we must be prepared &gt;&gt; as brother Venham says there's this all this atomic bomb is going around he says people are still unprepared &gt;&gt; we are still distracted oh wow I have to do this. I have to build this big house. &gt;&gt; What about our soul? &gt;&gt; We worry about different things, &gt;&gt; some little bitty things left and right. What about your life? &gt;&gt; What about your relationship with God? &gt;&gt; The young people, they're looking for the next boyfriend. &gt;&gt; The young boys say, "Oh, wow. I want to have a beautiful girlfriend." &gt;&gt; It's time to be on your knees and pray. Because if all our parents all of of our parents that they gone, who's going to stand? &gt;&gt; Who will we even know that there was a man called William Brandon? Sometimes parents don't realize it. &gt;&gt; If we go that our children will know what we stood for. &gt;&gt; Maybe this church will be closed. &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us. &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us. &gt;&gt; Our young people are dying. I know what I'm talking about. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are things that I'm telling you &gt;&gt; there's a lot going on. &gt;&gt; There's a lot going on. I don't think if the parents have an idea what's going on. &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot going on. &gt;&gt; May God awaken our spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That as we come in here, we see Lord I I I want to receive that kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that even if I die, I know where I'm going. &gt;&gt; Even if the rapture takes place, I know where I'm going. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Lord, I don't want to just go alone. I have my children, too. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to leave anybody behind. I'm going to carry with them. So what you do, you create an atmosphere that not even one of your loved ones &gt;&gt; will stay behind. &gt;&gt; So if you care about your children, &gt;&gt; you should fight for them as well. &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost in you will not allow anybody to go to hell &gt;&gt; or anybody to be lost. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will do everything in your power for that person to be saved. &gt;&gt; Then let's do it for our loved ones, &gt;&gt; for our children. &gt;&gt; Our loved ones, &gt;&gt; Abraham's group, when judgment was falling, &gt;&gt; Abraham was not even there. He was secure somewhere. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Abraham was secure somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could only hear judgment fire falling over there. But Elohim step in human flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was there talking to Elohim &gt;&gt; interceding for his brother Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was in God. &gt;&gt; He was hidden in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was protected in God. &gt;&gt; And those of ham as well &gt;&gt; will be protected. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know I'm speaking a different language, &gt;&gt; but those that will catch it catch it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; They are protected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our father Abraham &gt;&gt; was looking for a city &gt;&gt; which has a foundation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whose builder and mecca is God. There's something here I want to read. Genesis 18:18. Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great nation. That's God Elohim speaking. &gt;&gt; It says, "And all the nation of the earth shall be blessed but in him. I know him." &gt;&gt; Let's have amen. &gt;&gt; For I know him &gt;&gt; that he will command his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. and his household after him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken what of him. &gt;&gt; Not just Abraham, he would teach his children. You see that &gt;&gt; if our father Abraham taught his children, why are we having a problem as sons of Abraham to teach our children? &gt;&gt; Something is wrong somewhere. You you catch you catching this? &gt;&gt; The children of Israel were in Egypt. They were in a secure place in in Gan. &gt;&gt; Darkness was in Egypt. Death was striking Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were under the blood. &gt;&gt; They were protected under the tokens. &gt;&gt; They were citizen of a city &gt;&gt; which build and make is God. &gt;&gt; They could not be touched. &gt;&gt; Even if they were in bondage for many years, &gt;&gt; but yet they were protected. &gt;&gt; God takes care of his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a responsible father. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a responsible father. Yes, &gt;&gt; Elijah. He was sitting there. &gt;&gt; Jezebel came to kill, you know, to kill, trying to kill all the prophet and all of it. &gt;&gt; Elijah was running away from a woman. &gt;&gt; This woman was coming and say, "I'm going to destroy all the prophet. She brought idolatry into Israel." And what you know the story, right? &gt;&gt; Then there was something that Elijah said here. First Kings chapter 19:10. He said, "I have been very zealous for the Lord God of hosts. And the children of Israel has forsaken the covenant. Throw down the altar and slay the prophet with the sword and I." Do you see that? &gt;&gt; I if and I only left. I'm left and they seek my life to take it away. In verse 18, let's go to 18. Then God speaks to Elijah. It says yet &gt;&gt; I have left &gt;&gt; me. &gt;&gt; Oh glory. &gt;&gt; God would have a remnant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says, "Yet I have left me 7,000 in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto bear, &gt;&gt; and every mouth which have not kissed him." &gt;&gt; If you don't stand, God will have a remnant to stand. &gt;&gt; Even if you say, "Oh, I don't care about this message." &gt;&gt; God will have people Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; If you say, "Man, I don't care what," don't worry about it. God will have his people. &gt;&gt; God cannot be stopped because of your unbelief. Unbelief does not stop God. &gt;&gt; He's still moving. &gt;&gt; The cloud is still moving. &gt;&gt; The pill of fire is moving. &gt;&gt; And all the children of God are lining up looking facing to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; You know a magnet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When a magnet is passing around. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. There's plastic and whatn not. &gt;&gt; You can't even find stainless steel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When the magnets magnet come, he only picked up those that can be magnetized. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Elijah? Elisha, &gt;&gt; you know, he meets Elisha. Elijah, he they just talk to him. He says, "Hey, wait, wait, wait. Let me let me let me leave everything." They didn't even say a word. &gt;&gt; He just touch him and he follow him. &gt;&gt; Magnet. &gt;&gt; This word is a big magnet. &gt;&gt; You were in the world. You walking any type of way. You just hear that. Oh, God sent a prophet. You say what? You start walking &gt;&gt; without even questioning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God is a great magnet &gt;&gt; and it's coming into this building convincing the heart of every one of you. It's not me. I'm just a human being. &gt;&gt; But the word is bringing conviction into your heart. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; God is healing the sick in our midst. You don't even feel it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you wake up the sister, please? Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; In the time of Jesus, the Jews thought that there was a kingdom that had to come. Is that right? &gt;&gt; A great kingdom &gt;&gt; with a, you know, they were expecting a general. Oh no. This man will come like Solomon. You know, he will bring, you know, h, you know, wealth into this country and all. That's what they were thinking. That was the conception of how the Messiah should come. &gt;&gt; You know, God works in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Then we just saw a baby, a baby &gt;&gt; wrapped in swaddling cloth. Jehovah &gt;&gt; wrapped &gt;&gt; the the the one who created &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; the heaven and earth &gt;&gt; is now on earth &gt;&gt; condescending to the lowest spot to be a baby &gt;&gt; they were those people of the religious men of the day &gt;&gt; were were entangled into tradition &gt;&gt; but yet the word was being born. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is it not what is going on? We have a lot of denomination, &gt;&gt; but yet in the humble way, &gt;&gt; God was to Kentucky &gt;&gt; to Jeffersonville &gt;&gt; to have a little baby being born there, &gt;&gt; a messenger &gt;&gt; for this age &gt;&gt; in the most simplest way. where Luke chapter 17 has to be fulfilled in our days where God himself comes down &gt;&gt; allow amen sanctify a man and tell him don't drink don't smoke &gt;&gt; don't defile your body &gt;&gt; because I need to use that body for a purpose &gt;&gt; he will make himself available &gt;&gt; that God will use him &gt;&gt; he says just to let you guys know this is not me I'm just your brother &gt;&gt; he says I'll prove it to you by turning my back. He turned his back. He says, "You sister over there, that's what happened to you. This when you are a young person, this is where you coming from. This is your address." &gt;&gt; This is not a man doing it. &gt;&gt; This is the promised word being fulfilled in your day. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same Jesus &gt;&gt; that was walking that day to the well. &gt;&gt; Am I talking something different? I'm not talking about the call for body. &gt;&gt; The same Jesus &gt;&gt; the simple of fire &gt;&gt; was there talking to this woman. &gt;&gt; You know you had six husband. The five husband the one that you have is now your husband. &gt;&gt; That same one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is back again into this generation. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what you've been reading in the Bible &gt;&gt; is being fulfilled in your day. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Benam said the same angel &gt;&gt; that came over there is here in the building. &gt;&gt; Then it says greater than Solomon is here. &gt;&gt; It did not say that Mechisedc. It says this &gt;&gt; Misedc. &gt;&gt; Who is this Misedc? &gt;&gt; Mechisedc was this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; It says there is a one, a man that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; Saint, we are blessed. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If you love the Lord, can you give him a hand? &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Glory be to God. He's worthy. He's worthy to be praised. He's worthy to be praised. And I'm going to conclude with this. &gt;&gt; Let's let me look into something here. Please. Are you bearing with me just for a little bit more? Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Please forgive me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Please. &gt;&gt; Can we go ahead? Can we go ahead? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Preach it. All right. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate I will not I will not take long. Sorry. &gt;&gt; There's something here I need to get to get to the airport right now. &gt;&gt; Let's look at something here. Luke 17:20. &gt;&gt; This one. Luke 17:20. Luke 17:20. Is that right? 17 20. &gt;&gt; Okay. And then when it was demanded unto the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come. Is that right? &gt;&gt; He answered them and said the kingdom of God. Watch this very carefully. S we're getting somewhere. &gt;&gt; When he demanded of the Pharisees when that question is when is about the time. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When the kingdom of God should come, he answered them. He said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation." &gt;&gt; Are you catching this? &gt;&gt; Let's continue again. Neither shall they say, "Lord, here, Lord, there, behold, the kingdom of God is within you." &gt;&gt; They're looking for a time. God is pointing them to a location. &gt;&gt; Are you catching this? &gt;&gt; Are we reading together now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're needing a time. &gt;&gt; But God is pointing them somewhere. &gt;&gt; It says the kingdom of &gt;&gt; God is within. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. John chapter 14. John 14:16. I'm going to read the Bible before I go a little faster here. And I will pray the Father, &gt;&gt; he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you &gt;&gt; forever. &gt;&gt; That word is used with, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right, let's continue. Go down. Even the spirit of truth whom the world the cosmos &gt;&gt; the group of people are there &gt;&gt; cannot receive. Not everybody can receive that. &gt;&gt; Because it seeth him not &gt;&gt; neither knoweth him. What? Now catch this. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the kingdom. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now it's getting into him. &gt;&gt; Tell me, brother. &gt;&gt; Because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him, &gt;&gt; but ye know him. &gt;&gt; Oh, how do I know him? &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; so it must be there for me to know him. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's talking to the disciple. Say, you know him. Oh, &gt;&gt; what are you talking about? You're talking about somebody the spirit of truth whom the word cannot receive &gt;&gt; because it seeth not neither knoweth him but ye know him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he dwelleth what? &gt;&gt; With you &gt;&gt; and shall be &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch this now. Amen. &gt;&gt; He He is with you because he's still in that body &gt;&gt; called of the men of Galilee. &gt;&gt; But but down there's a promise of the company that has come. It's no longer we feel it's going to be what in you. &gt;&gt; Are we in the scripture? &gt;&gt; Are you in the scripture? &gt;&gt; All right. All right. 18. I will not leave you what comfortless saints. Yes. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; I will come &gt;&gt; to you. I &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will come to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yet a little while. &gt;&gt; The world &gt;&gt; seeth me no more, &gt;&gt; but ye see me, &gt;&gt; because I live, &gt;&gt; yet shall live also. Yes, I live also. Yes. &gt;&gt; At that day, yes, I know that I am &gt;&gt; in my father, &gt;&gt; ye in me, &gt;&gt; and I in you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Is that a word? &gt;&gt; John chapter 7:37. In the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood Christ says, "If any man what thirst, let him come unto me and drink." Is that right? &gt;&gt; He that believe on me as the scripture says, "Out of his belly &gt;&gt; shall flow water &gt;&gt; of water." 37 But this speak he &gt;&gt; of the spirit &gt;&gt; which that the believe on him &gt;&gt; should receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; was not yet given because Jesus was not what &gt;&gt; glorified. &gt;&gt; So Jesus had to be glorified for that spirit to go back to the body. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if he's still in flesh, that spirit cannot give be given. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That spirit cannot come. So the only way he has to die and be crucified &gt;&gt; ascend into heaven be glorified. &gt;&gt; Then that spirit to return back on earth, &gt;&gt; is he a different Jesus? &gt;&gt; Is he a different Jesus? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you don't believe it, this is another scripture. When Paul was on the way to Emmas, &gt;&gt; he's as he asked him, "Who are you, Lord?" &gt;&gt; He says, "I am what?" Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was Jesus dead already? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But which Jesus was he of? &gt;&gt; The same Jesus, but now in many membered bodies. &gt;&gt; So once Paul was persecuting the Christian, they were persecuting Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; What make them Jesus? It was the spirit of Jesus in them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh. Then the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; As the day was fully come, &gt;&gt; he has to come to that day, that appointed day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; John 16. Before I go ahead on myself. Nevertheless, 167 &gt;&gt; 167 &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; It is &gt;&gt; expedient for you. &gt;&gt; Let me stop there. &gt;&gt; Somebody's pondering about this. &gt;&gt; It is expedient for you that I go away. &gt;&gt; For if I I go not away, &gt;&gt; the comforter will not come unto you. &gt;&gt; But if I depart, &gt;&gt; I will send him unto you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Jesus had to die &gt;&gt; to be crucified, be glorified. Then &gt;&gt; back to the church again. &gt;&gt; The same Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not the three person of the Trinity. &gt;&gt; Excuse me to say that's nonsense. &gt;&gt; The same person, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The God of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; With Abraham. That was me. That was a theophony body. &gt;&gt; But that theophony body mech. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is this mech? &gt;&gt; The resurrected Christ, the resurrected word for this day. &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart. 172. A new earth, a new heaven. So, a new heaven and a new earth. For this first heaven and the first earth will pass away. But in the new heaven and new earth, Paul said over here in the book of Hebrews, for we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved. How did we get into that kingdom? Not by a religious system, &gt;&gt; but a kingdom of the kingdom of God is what? Within you. You read it. &gt;&gt; The kingdom, watch this. It says the king and &gt;&gt; his word is the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's within you. &gt;&gt; Are you catching this? &gt;&gt; Just to make sure it's up there. &gt;&gt; Vindicating &gt;&gt; the hour &gt;&gt; the hour &gt;&gt; that we are now living &gt;&gt; the promise that God made for this day, this age. Here we are living with the king, sitting in heavenly places, watching him doing these things. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say amen to the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why Paul was saying reject not him that speaketh now &gt;&gt; because down there because when he was talking about the the shaking and all of it that was in the time of Moses &gt;&gt; because when God spoke the mountain was shaking. Is that right? &gt;&gt; It was thundering and all of these things smoke and all of it. &gt;&gt; But when Paul was speaking there was no manifestation. &gt;&gt; No thunder but the same voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you catching this? &gt;&gt; Hebrew 12, we just read it. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; No manifestation, no shaking. &gt;&gt; But the promise word of God &gt;&gt; was happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So sometime we expect things to happen. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. If things does not move, Lord, I can't move. &gt;&gt; Give me a sign. &gt;&gt; But God is moving. In the time of Elijah, &gt;&gt; he was standing all said God was not there. &gt;&gt; But God, it was in a still small voice. &gt;&gt; Said you must be able to be sensitive to that still small voice. &gt;&gt; It's not loud. &gt;&gt; It's not shaking the mountain, but it's a revelation. &gt;&gt; You can be sitting in the room, nobody's around. You hear a voice speaking. &gt;&gt; You take heed to that voice. &gt;&gt; And that voice is not wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you look in the word versus that voice that spoke to you, you recognize that it's the same person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the one that spoke to your heart, saints, let me say this. This is an experience. &gt;&gt; You can't take it or reject it. That's fine. &gt;&gt; When God deals with you, &gt;&gt; it must be scriptural. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not every voice that you hear is of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; But if God speaks to your heart &gt;&gt; one day you randomly just reading the scripture you don't even know you're reading &gt;&gt; and you like &gt;&gt; I never knew &gt;&gt; what he told me &gt;&gt; is in the scripture [Music] &gt;&gt; saint when you can connect these things like this you know now that you are in a good place &gt;&gt; cuz you're no longer dealing with your own ability. This is God ministering to your heart now. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; This is not a church now. It's no longer just going to church. &gt;&gt; Now it's a revelation. &gt;&gt; He can speak to me yet he can minister to me in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same way that spoke is the same one that is speaking the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When brother Benham would say something, brother was talking about before he leaves, &gt;&gt; you know, he was mentioning about uh Isaiah and all of how Jesus closed the book and all whatnot. &gt;&gt; All of this thing had to happen. Even himself he did not know but did not know &gt;&gt; but God showed him he says you know whatever just happened &gt;&gt; it is in the scripture &gt;&gt; is that right &gt;&gt; it has to happen to you too &gt;&gt; something's happen in our life you don't know &gt;&gt; but God is speaking to your heart &gt;&gt; no manifestation what whatsoever but God was still speaking &gt;&gt; to his prophets now let's look at this I'm in closing &gt;&gt; the world is falling falling apart. 120 121 I'm I'm coming to a close. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; We have received a kingdom &gt;&gt; that cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We cannot be shaken in this hour. &gt;&gt; It's saying something. It says we are dead. Our life are hidden in in God through Christ. And not only that, but we are raised with him. Raised up what? in the in the system in the denomination organization. No, &gt;&gt; we are resurrected in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is within. Why this you see all these men made system must fall. &gt;&gt; All of these things people idea denomination oh call me Lutan and this he must fall. &gt;&gt; But there's only one thing that will remain. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Not once more I will shake the world. He's quoting now what we just read. But I will shake also I will shake heaven. And those things that cannot be shown is what will remain. &gt;&gt; And we receive a kingdom. Receiving a kingdom that cannot be sold or moved. That's the kingdom of God. Not a system, not a political will and or no denomination, but a kingdom. Let's go to the next one. Let's continue. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. We are in a kingdom sitting in heavenly places with the eternal king &gt;&gt; enjoying eternal life by the eternal word &gt;&gt; going to an an eternal heaven forever to be with him. Hallelujah. Living in the presence of the king. I love him. I'm so glad to be one of them. I'm so glad to be dead in Christ, alive in the kingdom of God. This is not my home. We seeking a kingdom. We seeking a king. We seek the king. We are already watch what the prophet is saying. &gt;&gt; We are already in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; We are seeking the king to come &gt;&gt; and the king quickly will come to his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? We receive a kingdom that cannot be moved. All these things are, you know, all these other things are falling apart. America is falling apart. Europe is falling apart. Asia is falling apart. All the world is falling apart. But we are in &gt;&gt; a kingdom, an eternal kingdom. It cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that kingdom is the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit in you &gt;&gt; is to be born again to die to yourself to receive the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And what is the Holy Spirit? Brother Benham says something in closing says I cannot in the message. What is the Holy Spirit? I'm not not going to read it. Says you cannot come and receive the Holy Ghost unless you know what it is. These these things are very important saint. We are blessed. When I saying we blessed &gt;&gt; we are blessed. &gt;&gt; Watch this element. &gt;&gt; You cannot come and receive the Holy Ghost unless you know what it is. &gt;&gt; You cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe &gt;&gt; it is given to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. And it is for you. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; You cannot know whether you got it &gt;&gt; or not. &gt;&gt; Unless you know what result &gt;&gt; it brings. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; Then you will know what you've got when you get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want me to repeat it again? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You cannot come &gt;&gt; and receive the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; unless you know what it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must know what the Holy Ghost is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; The second thing you have to believe that it is given, &gt;&gt; you know, to you &gt;&gt; and it is for you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; Now, you cannot know whether you got it &gt;&gt; or not. &gt;&gt; Unless you know what result it brings when you receive it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must know it. You know it is to you and for you. &gt;&gt; You know also the result it brings when you get it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Then you know what you got when you get it? &gt;&gt; Is it simple? Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints Peter was given the key of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; How many of us believe that? &gt;&gt; You can read it in Matthew chapter 16. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was given unto him the key to the kingdom. &gt;&gt; And later on the day of Pentecost after Peter had received the Holy Ghost is the one that had the key. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And they asked him, "Brethren, what must we do to be saved?" Is that right? &gt;&gt; He gave them three elements. He said, "Repent every one of you. Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and ye shall receive the baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost. That's act 2:38. Simple repentance there. Some people say, "Oh, I have received the Holy Ghost. When did you repent?" &gt;&gt; I don't have to know that, but you know, &gt;&gt; it's just the principle of the word, right? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I believe I'm going to heaven. Oh yeah, all of us. Glory to God. We going &gt;&gt; but we should not deceive oursel. &gt;&gt; We should not deceive ourselves. And I'm closing with this. I'm closing everything. I feel like this is this is the time. &gt;&gt; I feel in my heart the pool. So I feel like this is the time. So now if you walk in the tabernacle uh immen can you can you can you post have that picture and I watch I want you to catch to catch this. If a person that does not know God is that right is a sinner doing wrong because this temple here you know is what Moses illustrated in the in the wilderness. Is that right? You see that? You see that right? &gt;&gt; Okay. A person who does not know God because this is the temple and you are the temple. &gt;&gt; You touch that. So I'll be going back and forth but you can't able you can't be able to to digest this. You enter here you meet the breast and altar. This is a place where they had to kill the sacrifice. This is a wash called the lav. You're washing the the the the the high priest and and you know and also washing the sacrifice. And you enter, you've got the manora which is the candlesticks, the showbread, the altar of incense. And then down here is the altar, right? The ark of the covenant right &gt;&gt; over there. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; And this place here is where the shagana glory comes down. &gt;&gt; After the death of Jesus Christ, this curtain is no longer there. Praise God. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; Somebody catching this, right? &gt;&gt; This one is is no longer there. In the Old Testament, if you do not you cannot enter into this area because only the high priest had to enter once a year. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Are you catching this right? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Any any man that is not qualified to enter will die in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; But now not entering into this place is death. &gt;&gt; Then if you enter you die. For the matter of fact they would cher it. You see when Adam sinned, it was forbidden unto him &gt;&gt; to eat the tree of life. There were cherbins there. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Nobody had access into God fully because even all the prophet when they died, they went to paradise. Is that right? &gt;&gt; They could not really access that place. &gt;&gt; But Jesus had to die. And once he died, you remember the veil of the temple went from the top to the bottom, &gt;&gt; which means you have access &gt;&gt; into that place that was once forbidden. &gt;&gt; Nobody this morning can hinder you or this afternoon to enter to meet the glory. &gt;&gt; Nobody. You can go in by yourself if you have a choice to. If you're a sinner, you don't know God. You have access here. And by the bottom touch this as Calvary, you must die to yourself. Accept your sacrifice because Jesus Christ is your sacrifice. &gt;&gt; If you decide to be baptized, you get baptized. &gt;&gt; But don't stop here. &gt;&gt; Your destination is here. And most of the time when we enter, oh, I came to the altar, gave my life to the Lord Jesus Christ. That's it. &gt;&gt; Then I'm good. Woo man, I'm safe. &gt;&gt; But that's not your destination. &gt;&gt; Your destination is over there. &gt;&gt; You must meet &gt;&gt; the glory &gt;&gt; here. When you enter, you say, "Oh, I'm baptized." That's good. &gt;&gt; But let's watch our life. Because that snake &gt;&gt; that is causing us to sin &gt;&gt; is still there. &gt;&gt; But the venom if you have time study the future home. I was about to get into it but I I helped myself for a reason. I don't know why but anyways &gt;&gt; so you will understand but the venom is saying you entering here inside of your heart there is a snake &gt;&gt; seen the desire to see. He gave an illustration of two hearts. Says this one has a dove. The other one has a snake. When you enter here, you accept the Lord Jesus Christ. You be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's a good conscience toward God. Is that right? Baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But from here, &gt;&gt; don't stop here &gt;&gt; because that snake is not dead yet. &gt;&gt; You can be baptized. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; But you still have the desire to sin. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The same thing that you dealt with before when you were in the world, &gt;&gt; they're still coming back. &gt;&gt; You wondering say, "What in the world? I thought when I get baptized, all is gone." &gt;&gt; Because once you repent for the sin that you have right here, those sins are gone. &gt;&gt; It's empty. There's no recordet of it. &gt;&gt; But you still have a walk. If you linger here too long, &gt;&gt; that snake has not died yet. You need the fire of this place &gt;&gt; to burn that snake. &gt;&gt; That snake will make you comfortable to come to church. &gt;&gt; You will sing in a choir. &gt;&gt; You would explore all your gift. You'll be a very gifted person. That's why brother Benham says when Judas he operated in miracles. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But when it came to the Holy Ghost, he showed his color. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a time there is a principle of the harvest. Everything that is planted does not show its color as it is planted &gt;&gt; is the fruit that would will actually show everything. &gt;&gt; That's why let me say I could have entered into this because of time. Please forgive me. This is the place where we must meet God. There the reason why we come into church is not just say I'm already baptized. I'm already in this church is not enough. &gt;&gt; But instead of us being a blessing, we become a stumbling block. &gt;&gt; That snake is stealing having effect on our life, how we behave, our answers, our reaction and all of it. Because that snake is not has not died yet. &gt;&gt; But you need the fire of God &gt;&gt; to burn that snake &gt;&gt; so that the do the the the dog &gt;&gt; can have a place to dwell in. &gt;&gt; Saint you know when Jesus this guy came to Jesus and said good master no not good masterus how you call him Nicodemus. He told him something. He says, "If you're not born again, you cannot see the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; You would not," In other words, but the Bible says, "You cannot understand. You would not understand the kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; Show me the quote 11 or 12, please. And I'm going to close it. I'm not going to read it. I'm just going to pick up something. It says, "When you understand the belief, Jesus says, except a man is born again, you cannot see the kingdom." In other words, understand the kingdom. The kingdom because the kingdom is what &gt;&gt; you touch there. So you have to understand and you only understand it is compare what makes you do with what the Bible said it would make you do. &gt;&gt; You see that? Then your problem is solve. See it is the Holy Spirit. said in closing, sister can come please. We have received a kingdom. We must be born into that kingdom to not be shaken. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You say amen to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot of things happening in our life. We having struggles and different things. Many of us have to come to that place to meet God. &gt;&gt; It's not just about coming to church. What God recognized that would not be shaken &gt;&gt; is the Holy Spirit, the person of Jesus Christ in our heart. saints that would make us as the church to enter into that place to meet God because the world is shaking. Everything around us, you know, nations are breaking. There's a lot of things happening. Do you agree with me? But the word says there's only one kingdom that will not move, &gt;&gt; will not be shaken is the Holy Spirit in our heart as we standing. We can stand please s after hearing such a word it comes to our heart now Lord help me every time that I come and when those doors are open I'm not just coming to make a presence here I need to mean business if these things are not be spoken openly. We're not actually doing a great job. But we have to be prepared, saints. Let me put it this way, saints. I feel the Holy Spirit pounding in my heart. If you have a problem with someone, don't leave this place without fixing it. Can I repeat that again? Today must be maybe your last day. If you have a problem with someone because as a Christian we must live the life of Christ. So if we really got the spirit of Christ we should not leave this place and having a problem with someone. We have to make it right. The only responsibility that I have is to preach. I have my own life to worry about. It's not just I'm preaching to you myself, too. I'm sitting here. I need God's grace, too. But the word is true. I am guilty, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thy word is true. Have your way. &gt;&gt; How many of us can really recognize it? Say, Lord, I lift my hand. I need you. How many of us really need God from the bottom of their heart? &gt;&gt; Look inside of your own life. These secrets that are still hiding over there that nobody knows about. God is speaking directly to you. This might be your last day. I don't know. I'm not scaring anybody. I'm just saying. But the church of God has to be ready. Shall we pray? Heavenly Father, we're coming before you this afternoon. You've been so good to us. You have helped us so far to leave the world and to come. Lord, you have helped us. We have made a decision to go and to come to the altar and confess our sin. We've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord, now we need to enter into the holiest of holies and to meet the pill of fire. Lord, we pray tonight, this afternoon, rather, Lord, that anybody that would have a desire to receive that Holy Ghost, Lord, may you come and confirm and vindicate your word in the life of anybody that is really desiring for it. Lord, nations are shaking. Bombs are ready to be to be completely to annihilate this earth. But yet, Lord, there are people that are unprepared. We are distracted. Oh God, but here you have given us your word. You have sent us a prophet. Lord, if there's any sick in our midst, Lord, your word says I send my word and my word and heal them. May you heal us father Lord of our body, our spirit and soul from our hurts. Oh God, Father Lord you are merciful. You are gracious. Lord please help us. Lord, we need you at this moment. Oh God, may you please touch heart and bring a spirit of conviction. Bring a spirit of conviction, Lord. Please grant it, Lord. Because you are calling someone tonight. You are working the awareness of somebody tonight to take heed to the word of God. Lord, you have called us many time. You are also calling us again. You are telling us to come and take heed to the word. Your servant and many servants of God has gone through this place has preached the gospel. But Lord, we must yield our hearts to you, Lord. Cuz at the end of the time, oh God, Father, everything are shaking. But are we going to stand? Where are we going to spend eternity, Lord? But we're looking to you, Father, this morning, afternoon. &gt;&gt; Touch our hearts, Lord. May you change us, oh Lord. May you transform us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Is there anybody here tonight that said, you know, I just want to renew my relationship with God. I want a new walk with God. Is there somebody tonight, this afternoon, can raise up their hand and say, Lord, I just need a new walk, like a a different experience with you. You can pray in your own just in your own heart. If there is something in your heart that you're struggling with, tell God about it. Say, "God, you you know this. You know this thing. I'm still struggling with this. And that thing is about to destroy you. You tired of it. You say enough. I've been fighting this for so long. I'm just tired." Would you take heed to God's voice and say, "Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my desire. Everything that I've got, I give it to you at this moment. [Music] Oh God, may you come, Father, Lord, and intervene in our heart tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we need you, Lord, in this moment. So God, please may you send your Holy Spirit. May you send your Holy Spirit, Father, Lord, in this room, in this moment. Lord, you brought a burden in my heart.
