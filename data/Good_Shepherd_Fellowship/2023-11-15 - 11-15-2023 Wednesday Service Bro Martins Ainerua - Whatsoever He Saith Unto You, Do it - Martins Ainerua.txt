our feet tonight we will read a uh a verse of two from uh from the Bible and then we go right into to our prayer meeting before we change the order of the service praise the Lord amen let's read from Luke Chapter 5 this a scripture cut my attention tonight Luke Chapter 5 savior [Music] savior you're my heart oh cist Luke Chapter 5 we read from verse [Music] 27 Luke 5 reading from verse 27 and after these things he went forth speaking about Jesus and saw a Publican Nam Levi sitting at the receip of custom and he said unto him follow me and he left all rose up and follow him and Levi made him a great feast at his own house and there was a great company of [Music] publicans and of others that sat down with him but the scribes and Pharisees murmur against his disciples saying why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners and Jesus answering said unto them they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick I came not to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance amen amen now before we pray [Music] tonight if you read this account over in the Book of Matthew chapter 9 Matthew testify of himself but he did not give the account in the way that is given he testified and said how Jesus called him into the ministry or called him to be a disciple he said follow thou me and he said follow but when Luke testified of the same account he gave us a background that M you was a Publican so which mean he was not part of the religious group he was not a Pharisees a Publican means an unbeliever so Luke gave us this account that Matthew was an unbeliever working for the Roman government doing his custom work and Jesus call him and when he received this C he decided to bring Jesus home and have a feast and invite invite his friends if he was not a religious guide his friends would be unbelievers so he invited a bunch of publicans over and there also some scribes and Pharisees show up at the at the feast and now they are confused why is Jesus and his disciple hanging out with bunch of publicans and Sinners and Jesus said this since Sunday this this thought has been on my mind and it actually led me to to look at the scripture Jesus said they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick and and I I came to realize or I I started thinking about it all through the [Music] week that it was because of a need for a [Music] savior that was the reason why God gave us one praise the Lord and listen to me carefully tonight I I don't know if it will be real to you like it it came real to me and until we have the need many of us grow up around church we grow up around the message of the hour we've been hearing it so sometimes it's hard for us to see the area of our need but until that need is identified that area of need in our life because that's what the Savior was given for that is the only way he can feel that need until we can be able to identify that we have a [Music] need praise the Lord there was a situation in Eden and that's what God provided a [Music] lamb and I believe that's when salvation become real to you when you have identified your need for a savior some people need Church some people need the preacher and we can have all of that like Jesus said it's only them that are sick that need a physician praise the Lord and I want for us to do that tonight I know many of us we are safe we love the Lord [Music] but may God give us a need for him tonight and I believe it's a need for more of God that have drawn us to the house of God tonight not just to be identified with a Wednesday service and I sure there are some that would love to be here tonight but as we go to God in prayer tonight let's play I need thee Oh I need thee [Music] if you love to sit whichever comfortable position that is good for you let's just bow our heads tonight as we will go to the Lord in [Music] prayer [Music] bless me now my [Music] savior thank you [Music] Jesus [Music] every hour I need the oh bless be now my I saor I can't to be let's sing that one more time oh yes I need need thee oh Lord how I need the even this our lord Jesus I leave the God bless me now my [Music] sor [Music] to let us pray together tonight I know for sure that as a church we need him we need more of God we want God to have his preeminence we want the word of God to Prevail we want the Holy Spirit to take the leadership you as a brother you as a sister tonight whatever you can identify that is a need of this church because it's only the sake that need a physician you have to identify a need for God to move towards he's the high priest of our confession let's pray together tonight let's lift our voice voices let's pray for the need of our home let's pray for the need of our family the need of our children the need of our spouses let's bring our need it's only the one that is in need when we can identify our need when we can identify the area that we need God the most [Music] let's pray together tonight heavenly father

want to once again appreciate our pastor for uh giving me the opportunity to fellowship with you I want to appreciate the family too I appreciate you as a church if you have no come we cannot be preaching to the church you know God bless you appreciate every one of us our prayers is that H the Lord will prepare every one of us and make us ready for that glorious Rapture the Rapture have been preached about for the past 2,000 years when Christ came and paid the Supreme sacrifice for you and me uh you know it's common with human beings when they wait a little while for something they happen some of them make up their mind this it cannot be true but every word of God is true we thank God for making a way for us tonight to get to be in his house to Fellowship around the message of the hour the prophet said it's not me that say it but is the Lord as me to say it that I should store the message that the bride will have need of it and today we are feeding upon that message and is Transforming Our Lives he giving us Rapture faith is making us ready for the coming of the Lord amen amen God bless you uh I promise that as long as God will give me life and each time I visit this country I will always pay a visit because I love your Spirit am yeah you see when you come to a church to preach uh there are some places you come to preach it will take you a very long time before you can get one amen from anywhere well it doesn't stop the preacher from preaching all right but sometimes I do ask people when they so quiet on me I say hey guys am I preaching from Quran from why you so quiet but I thank God because when you come to a church where uh the people have be rightly taught and the pastor is of fire and know that kind of a thing they pull they pull you to preach longer because they are receiving you know I have to force myself on Sunday to stop because I didn't was enjoying you you know God bless you I say God bless you well if another opportunity call before the Rapture let me see you in the Rapture amen amen God bless you shall we please rise up and we read a portion and then just Fellowship while before the time runs out yeah Bibles to John Chapter 2 The Gospel According to Brother John Chapter 2 we are reading the first five verses it's always good to carry our bies when coming to church some of you are fing hands looking at my face it's not the best okay five verses praise God Amen all right goes like this at the third day there was a marriage in Canon of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there and both Jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of Jesus said unto him they have no wine Jesus said unto her woman what have I to do with thee my hour is not yet kind his mother sath unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it may the Lord bless the portion of that Bible into our hearts you can please be seated you know sometimes you know sometimes we don't like correction we don't like to be corrected and may I say something about it the Bible say all scriptures is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doy for Repro for correction for instruction orto righteousness so that the man of God the woman of God the boy of God the girl of God might be perfect thoroughly for unto all good works amen know the Bible teaches us that like in in our children the Bible say foolishness is in the heart of the children he said it take the road of Correction to drive it out that's what the Bible says God want us to correct our children where they are wrong are we are God children when we are wrong in anything it is God responsibility to correct us and the Bible tells us anyway that no correction is you know is joyous when you know he said but they that we believe it and exercise themselves in it they shall be blessed so when God bring correction don't be offended because he doesn't want us to perish with the word am God bless you amen so from the scripture we have read before we start preaching let us just have a word of prayer you know sometimes when you come here you know your mind is just flowing with certain things that you have studied father we are happy again tonight we thank you because your Ser the pastor had already prayed for this service individuals have prayed but we have been made to know that his only one we can never do too much Prophet say we can do so many things too much but that we can't do it so much because say we should pray without ceasing we have come tonight to Fellowship again around your word we believe that you have said a messenger to bring a message onto US Lord Jesus as we Fellowship around it if we need to be corrected may you correct us if we need to be rebuke may you rebuke us Lord whatsoever we know that we have need of give to us Lord as individuals we have come to stand before the mirror of the world may we see ourselves as we are thank you Father hide all of us other the blood where the enemy can do us no har we ask that you bless our pastor bless the officers bless the musicians bless every member of this assembly thank you our father may this message that we have sent to us may you get us ready for the Rapture thank you our father in all the nations of the world that meetings like this have been had tonight may you bless your people in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you yeah tonight I just want to pass a few comment on on I think verse four or that we read that was Mary you know I've said it before or suay I remember I said it that Mary in the actual sex was not the mother of Jesus Christ which I know we all know was she was just an incubator we know that there are some places where the Bible talk about mother you know it was the disciple putting those things down at that time they have not got a full revelation of what are all about when they were invited to that marriage they went why they were there the Bible says their wine God finished and Mary got to know that they needed wine Mary be the incubator knowing very well that it was not man and woman living together that brought Jesus to this life she knew that that child was a supernatural person she knows because it was a given birth to Jesus that broke our virginity bear with me you know I'm preaching not that I want to be mean he knows she if nobody else knows she knows that is why she now appealed to Jesus these people have a need here is is marriage you can see the crowd that are gathered they don't have wine Jesus said woman you can never find one place in the Bible where Jesus called Mary Mother any time Jesus talk about Mary he addressed her as woman of course that's is what she was to him the people don't have one and Jesus said woman what have I to do with you my time has not yet come Mary knowing very well that you can never sincerely put a request before Jesus without him answering you yes I think we all have testimony about that God answers prayers amen that is the word say whatsoever thing you desire amen when you ask in prayer believe you receive it and you shall have it amen amen now when that happened Mary now he may did care the way Jesus answer her he knows that he have presented the request and the answer will come many went to the servant he said did you see the man I went to talk to they say yes say whatever he says or to you do it see whaty was saying in is that that man may come up to say something that doesn't look reasonable to human being yes but as long as is the one who said it do it oh my just do it now Jesus did not get up from where he was now that he did Pray when the time finally came he said feel the water pots with water is why we need our ts are flowing he could have told him that Master you want to help us it is really not water we needed though it's wine wine that is finished no water the type is running but they have been told whatever he say just do it they fill the water pts with water Jesus did get up he did he pray he did he shout he did bow his head amen he said draw amen go and give to the governor of the feast they would have told them is why we need we we fill this with water by ourselves we are looking for one you say should draw water to go and give Governor but they be told oh my they have been told whatever he say just do it brothers and sisters from Genesis to revelation God does need your suggestion whatever the word of God says is yeah and amen amen yeah yeah and amen now they they draw the water and we to give to the governor the governor didn't know what was happening when he tasted it he made comments he said call me the bridegroom when the bridegroom came said ah every man at the beginning of the feast used to set up good wine when the people are well drunk then that which is bad because they are under the now they can drink anything he said but you have reserved the good one till now even the what you call even the group he didn't know what was happening it's only the servants that knew and the bible say that was the first miracle that Jesus performs praise be to God Amen this Jesus we are talking about is the same yesterday yes today and forever when ABR preach a message he said cast all your your cares not some all your cares upon Him for he car for you that is why I so much believe so much that until truly God is finished with you as his child no sickness can take you is the Lord that God that healed all our diseases the Bible say he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised our iniquities the of our peace was upon him by his we were healed there's no sickness that God cannot heal there is no incurable disease before our God Amen if you see any of his children die die by any sickness not because God could heal because he have an appointed time for every one of us amen he's a great physician yes amen amen yes oh man when he performed the surgery on Adam he didn't use knife he didn't use scissors amen when he brought out if from inside that place Blessed Be His Ho name that is see our God today am it has not changed right at all and he wish that you Prosper amen I be head as your soul Prosper what make our soul Prosper you know we talk about what happen in the garden on Sunday when God made that com does thou art does thou shall return some people or learning that wrestle with scriptures for their own condemnation they say what are you saying all beings are dust they to dust period they don't have the revelation of what that word is said the prophet said that was spok of the body yes it's not the soul amen my father in before he finally gave his life to Christ he was having a problem in the scripture where Jesus said they that have they will have abundantly and they that don't have the to that he have we be taken from them he said what how can you so say that but he may God help us you see this Bible is God IR written form am amen scientifically you can never understand it right that is why you need as a man you need as a woman a boy as a girl to be born again so when you are born again the spirit that wrot this Bible now dwelling in you you can now understand the [Music] Bible amen amen that was his problem until he gave his life to Christ praise God Amen what are we saying tonight when that happened the old place the especially the who knew what they did it was water they f with and the governor gave that type of a remark they knew right from that time that that man was not an ordinary man yes today Jes people call Jesus a second person in Trinity from Genesis to Revelation the word Trinity is not in the Bible M it is just a word that was invented about the false denomination that the daughters carried overboard we all know the first denomination we know it yeah we know it but God has promised his children yes you shall know the truth and the truth will do what set you free we have been set free from denominationalism we have been set free from easing we have been set free from all theological teachings yes yes after the apostles were with Jesus remember he was the one who called them after he has called them and they were with him for 3 years and 6 months when he was to go he recommended uh uh the Jerusalem for them to stay and wait until they be endued with power from on high yes what the blood of Anima could not do is that it was blood of animal and the life that was in the blood of animal was animal life yes we said it on suay couldn't come upon the worshiper but when God became flesh it was just for one purpose that one purpose was for you and me to be manifested Amen period that's why Jesus said greater love and no man than this that a man love his friends and he gave his life to them amen that is why we are what we are today we are a product of Grace yes sing grace of God Amen thank you that is why no matter what you see no matter how bad somebody is your children are not they stubble don't don't do contrary just go on your knees for them you will like them before God met you a yeah the Bible say all have seen have come short of the glory of God all means all all sin you read Ephesians 2 only the time will not permit us to be reading scripture because you know time is always our enemy all of us were like that me that I'm preaching these things today if I tell you my past life I know you will believe me anyway I know you will believe me you know I can't I can't be telling lie when the word is before me oh man but God reach in Mery it's what make us what we are today thank youus not by works L any man should boast we are all subject to sin know we're all drinking s like people drinking water you come and tell us h there's a better life we just laugh are we looking for better life we are satisfied with the world we have smoking drinking G all kinds of rubbish and Alles but God who has predestinated you and me who reach came across our path the day you gave your life to Christ there were many that came to the service after the service the man was talking don't mind him yeah oh yeah it depends on where you come from Judas brother Abraham said the apost apostleship of Judas was not inferior to that of Peter the way God Wass he knew very well that this man is a thief he make him the treasurer of the church the day that woman came I use that Cly H what do you call you per to per his body which Jesus said was he was anointed for that for the burrier yes it was only Judas who protested said this things should have be sold for 300 P have be given to the poor the Bible say not because he came for the poor because he was a thief every money that comes to his SP brotherr said not that Jas actually wanted to Ser Jesus because of his love of money that made him to do that thing because several times Jesus they wanted to arrest him he just passed the People by there was a time they they L him you know at the brim of a mountain so that they could push him down he just passed them he didn't know that his time was not yet that is why look my pocket looks to be getting dry let me go make covenant with the denominations and S him and I will warn them it be my Escape there the money is not affordable so he made that Covenant of 30 pieces of silver and he came to the G and he said look Jesus was just you know uh you can't differentiate him from his disciples he has to take Judas by a king to identify him to the men he s say look this Covenant I enter to with the money is not affordable it the man Escape because he was very sure that Jesus will escape if you look at the way Jesus used to escape he doesn't run not that he run they couldn't find him no he just passed them by his time was not yet nobody could lay hands on him if he didn't give himself up who can God who is he a m can this a carpenter the that put it together like this have ability with a hammer to Pieces it and make fire with it yeah that was the almighty God you know where they came to the Garden they he say what are you looking for say Jesus of nazare say I'm the one the Bible say they all went backward and fell down it was because his time has when Judah must have seen that they all I said him before he's going to escape but he did Escape when he saw that he was arrested they were M him he were doing all kinds of thing condemnation came to his heart I betray innocent blood he repented it is one thing to repent after repentance they used to be in need of restitution when he repented he made restitution he spent out of that money he brought him back to the temple he said I betray but they say what are you talking what concerns us see you to him he went out after repentance you should believe that God has accepted your repentance and he has forgiv you but instead of that he went and committed suicide you see Peter did the same thing similar thing he only didn't make covenant he didn't take money when he was telling Jesus Jesus was telling what was going to happen to him Peter said what said I we die with you if everybody go I will go he was boting in the flesh yes yes look as Christians the only Power we have is the Holy Ghost amen are you following me the only Power we have is the holy ghost that is why we don't put Trust In the Flesh we trust him he that has saved us f with promise he will never leave us nor forsake us we trust him even hard situations you are faced with some situation don't know the way out that's why you go your KN and commit yourself to him he will said no matter situation you are fa he said if you are honest and you are sincere he said God has a way of revealing his will to you about that matter oh sure so we find that uh he went and committed sde it was pet that was say I will die with if everybody go will go Jesus said you mean it he say yes Jesus know very well he was boasting in the flesh he said before will Crow you would have denied me three times said me deny you okay when they came to arrest Jesus Peter stay a away was following them so it doesn't miss the way they took Jesus but he quite a distance so see that at least he can see the way they pass finally when when they put him where they put him and the made fire it was very cold he also come to warm himself somebody look at him and said you look as if you were one of them Peter said me one of them there's nothing like that I don't know what we are talking about a small girl came he said we saw you in the garden with him he swear he it's not me at the third time the eye of Jesus had himself met have I not told you he went outside he went bitterly did he go commit suicide why did it go commit suicide he was a seed of God Jesus is not come to die for S seed they cannot be converted are you following me amen that is why he keeps say my sheep my sheep my sheep hear my voice they hear it they follow me he said the voice of strangers we they not listen to if you look at the way Jesus described you and me sheep bring it to the Natural you see how gentle sheep are not only gentle in most cases you find a group of them of course you can't see that in America anyway like you areas in Africa you find a group of them walking together in a sun where sun is shining you find that the group together together like this many of them the prophet said they are shading one another from the Sun am amen that is why we as Christians we don't fight each other we don't hate each other we don't take evil talk evil about each other we love one another because we are members of the same family as God love us we also love each other and when Jesus was finally talking about separating sheep from goat have you ever seen goat the nature of goat is terrible very stubborn good goat is coming to eat your something here you eat it with a sck sometimes he say when he's great he's watching you at the back as turning back is right there very St thing God bless you church amen now we find out that this Judas now the Bible say he has gone to his place he has a place where Jesus some people it us to stumble them she is Jesus as Jesus called Matthew has Jesus do you know the call of those disciples were Supernatural have you ever watch it some of them were with their daddy you know they were fishermen somebody just come say follow me I mean no argument no second thought they don't follow him Matthew was a custom officer you know in the office they have to they have to exchange work before he will leave your office there supposed to be another one who he replace him and then he goes when Jesus met him and say follow me whether office or no office he just follow him that was Supernatural calling that's why there's no way God can call his child and he will say he will not go no you you are helpless when he call you yes you must follow many people say then why did he call Judas the answer is not far F from the scriptures because after he called before he called you that he didn't make that statement it was after he called you that he made the statement say have I not chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil that's right then why did he chose him he because it's only Judas that can do the work of Judas Peter couldn't do it yes no Matthew no b or Philip or the rest of them it will have to take Judas to do the work of Judas amen amen that is why it Tak him to betray Jesus nobody else Jesus knew not that he was God doesn't made mistake yeah he knew that this is the one who will do the job scriptures must be fulfilled that's right oh praise the Lord amen then we find out that as they were going that very night of the Betrayal I said it on someday they were together because they prepare a place for the last oper with them he said the one that is deeping his hand with me on this spirit is the one who will betray me Peter say is he me Matthew say is he me when he come to Judah said th the man I will deep I give to his P when he de he give it to Judah when he took it the Bible say Satan took over his life when he stood up he was going to make that Covenant with the denomination Jesus said that is th doest do quickly the disciples that were sitting with it they didn't know what he was saying but Judah knew that did not stop him because he came from somewhere and he must go back to where he come from we are the people of God Amen you don't become a person of God the day you were converted it is because you are a person of God ordained by God before the foundation of the world that's why you can believe the gospel and the gospel take effect in your life am oh yeah you know brother preach the K man Redeemer he has only come to redeem that which was his own that's right so we are so we are so grateful amen I've enjoyed your pastor in his house so much that I I don't know whether I was feeling not to go I don't know we so much sit down Fellowship you know the Bible say let the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ be what your conversation not politics we are not politicians we are strangers we are prms we are just passing through here oh man you know our Father Abraham was looking for that City yes amen that has no Foundation amen or that has Foundation rather whose Builder and maker is God Amen that's right hallelujah amen that is where we are going amen the four square City built by God designed by God it will be wonderful it will be glorious amen amen praise the Lord even did that payment the B stop which is the six Dimension where the Prophet was taking they didn't want to come back just that place do you know there's something I didn't me on Su I think I pass this area too said by the grace of God have been to the two places the region of the L which is down and the six Dimension which is what we can call Paradise today he said at the age of 14 when he was shot know blood was you know science has not achieved as much as they have done today so they couldn't just stop the blood the was so most breed it to death actually passed on that is why he went to that place and when he came back he told us he said that place whatever you do don't travel towards that place say you can never picture that place so bad he say it's even worse that when one is inside fire as it be but is not being consumed said never whatever you do never go towards that way how do you go towards that way he told us there are two places that the lives of human beings are INF fled from amen he said if you are a Christian your fop is up that is what influ your life that's what make you Gentle that's what make you humble that's what make you loving that's what make you forgiving that's what make because your life is being fresh from above when you see a man that is nothing he can kill he can cheat he can fight he can fuse he can qu I'm not talking about before our conversion he said he said his life is being refresh from other he said no matter how much you say my life is being fleshed from above he said what your character am because there is a power that is influencing your life in another place he was telling us he said both your actions and reactions is motivated by a spirit you know preach discernment of spirit that is why all of us he say we can't see each other he said we only see the body that car the real [Music] you may God help us that is why nobody can M Christianity if you meet a holy ghost man he will know that you are mimicking Christianity know that's right the prophet said if you if I talk to a Man 2 minutes I will know whether I receive the holy ghost or not he said the same thing you can you can tell said because the Holy Ghost is a life amen and he went to tell us he said an elect cannot persecute an elect amen it take an evil spirit to persecute the spirit of God he doesn't like God at all whether he like God he doesn't like God we know he's beginning we know he's heading so he has no business with us God bless you am I say God bless you now we can see this statement of H Mary whatever you say do it a children of God do you know the nature of an unbeliever is a disobedient nature you can't live above your nature that is why God we said what he said whether it's in the Bible or not this is the way I want to do your will versus God's will God want it done like this you want it done like this you will follow your own Jesus said if you man slap you turn the other Chek let me tell you if you not filled with the Holy Ghost and they man slap you if you have knife you will shook him before you remember what the Bible say cuz that nature is a is a terrible nature it's a disobedient nature you remember the case of what do you call it King when God asked him where is your brother he said what did you app me to be his guide asking me of my brother they don't fear God s seed but we thank God for the seed of God that is what Jesus came to die for amen amen I am happy I can publicly announce that I am one of them I believe you canum that you are one of them because no man no man ever me Jesus I remain the same brother say what were you before you met him what are you now when you meet him there is a permanent change permanent change therefore if any being Christ is a new creation the way Jesus was born that is the line you drop into after your conversion right you know the Bible say see did my mother conceive me yes it's a permissive will this man and woman reproduces children that is why God introduced the new bir the false bir we were BN defeated nobody is good in that false bth that's why the Bible say all that are in the flesh cannot please God they can't please God you hear the denomination evil things that happen there pastors will go from Seminary to Seminary to Seminary to Seminary they can even plaster the whole world here with certificates certificate doesn't change nature the only thing that can change nature is God himself nothing else can do it praise God Amen when a man meet God oh man it's a different person all together completely some say well I believe in being a Christian but I don't believe in being foolish the prophet said until you become foolish you can't even be a Christian amen amen say you snap me say I should turn the other side am I a fool you must be a fool before you can follow God as long as you want to hold to your will you can't even follow God you just can't do it God help us but in such a way that amen as the Sheep of God God has made us in such a way that once we hear his word we say Amen to it why because the prophet said before the world began God knew us he wrote our names in the last book of life so you cannot come even emphasize it to a point to say that it is impossible for a child of God to be lost he said instead of he said if a child of God is L then God is not complete that's a very powerful statement all the of God they shall be converted am because that is what he come to Die For in John chapter 17 where Jesus will pray he said father all that you gave to me with the exception of the child of predition so that the scripture might be fulfilled I didn't lose any you say I'm no longer in the world I not saying you should take them out of the world but all I say you should do prevent them from Evil yes even if you don't know how to pray which will be be a shame you say you don't know how to pray how can you be f with the Holy Ghost you say you don't know how to pray is a shame the Bible say pray without season am you know no matter how civilized the country is I've experienced it since I came so sometime my people will call me from home the network will be misbehaving they will hear me I will hear them sometime they hear I hear them they will hear me the network that conects us to Heaven it doesn't do like that yes whether you are in the restro yes whether you are taking your birath whether you are cooking your food whether you are driving Hallelujah wherever you are the network is through am we have a say to our maker Oh Glory to God that is why the scripture said bring all your cares on him bring your problem to the Lord and leave it there unfortunately sometime we bring our problem to the Lord in prayer we find it difficult to leave there after praying over it we still carry it when going back home we still carry it put it for our back may God help us once you commit it to him is as good as if the problem is solved Amen brother Abraham asked a question does God answer prayer he said yes he does he said does he do it quickly every time he said no he doesn't do it quickly every time he even went forther to say no to your request is also an answer from God yes praise God Amen this Kingdom that we are talking about one time I was in the house a set of Jehovah Witnesses came to my gate they were knocking the gate so I just came out I met them IM I saw them I know the set of people they are I welcomed I said how can I help you say we are come to preach about the kingdom that is so come to you I say so your own kingdom is here to come I said the kingdom I believe in is it not the world God promis in the Bible say yes I said don't come the kingdom is already here they were looking at each other as if I didn't know what I was I okay turn your Bible to Romans Roman 14:1 17 can we read it Romans 14:17 let me quickly read it and see oh praise God Amen Romans 147 14 17 guess I give it WR right I mean to say 17 he said for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost when they read it they look at each other say make they go they P their Bibles they went brother abrah told us that that Kingdom that we are talking about that will be established on Earth one day if we say a day is coming there be no more America as America there be no more Germany Jesus is coming to take over the kingdoms of the world he will establish his own here after the renovation of this place amen the kingdom presently is a spiritual Kingdom amen and the Holy Ghost is what bring the kingdom to your soul yeah are you following me right that is what we have just read here it's not meat and drink it's not wearing of appar it's not living in mches it's not getting new job it's not getting new car it's not getting new accommodation all those things are fine praise God because those are the things in most cases we Rejoice about new accommodation increase the salary praise God there's nothing bad about that know I'm an old man I know if I even off you you w beat me praise God Amen but you see all those things they do not they are not criteria of Salvation that's why the Bible tells us we brought nothing here we are not taking anything out Amen in our country one time the wife of a governor died and when they were to bury the woman all the jewes the woman had they must be going to millions of dollars they Spark all the Jewish put them inside there bring clothes put them they were just displaying wet but they have forgotten in the crowd like that it's not only people that come to M with you that are there there are people that come there that are come to mock you and not to M with you I know what I'm talking about they all those there in the night the T came they dog the they D the casket out carry all those and all the properties they put in do you know they her back they didn't may God help us when Lazarus died the denomination where Lazarus H Mara and Mary came out from majority of them TR to be the place not to come and but to come and mo she we told you you say you see what Jesus who left our church he never finished now he hit people other people where they see you you go that you know accommodated him now you wash his cloth now you prepare his food you take care of him he come your now you know come because they said when when when Lazarus fall sick when Lazarus fall they sent the message to Jesus The Messengers they met Jesus they told you your friend is sick answer them they went back they thought he will come he did come when the sickness went to come H they sent another message this man is at the point of death to would you call he didn't come but Jesus was he just doing things oh man he had been told yes that he's going to resurrect rarus not to heal him oh praise God Amen brother say you pray at the answer is not coming he said God is not ignoring you he know what he's doing oh sure he know what he's doing now we find out that finally finally when the time came Lazarus died now he have been buried 4 days Jesus spoke to his disciples said let's go Lazarus sleeping me that the disciples were in the flesh they don't understand spiritual things he said we are told he be sick if he cannot sleep it means he's doing well he said this is what I am say Lazarus is dead let us go iwake him so they all came as they were approaching the place the news came to the house that uh the master is coming brothers and sisters the Lord Jesus Christ is master of all situations there is no hopeless situation before him the things that men think are impossible he specializes in it put your absolute trust in him he never fails there is no situation that above him oh glory to God what are we saying now M stood up he went and meet Jesus he said Master we can learn a lot from this he said Master if you have be here our brother would not have died and then Jesus said your brother will rise again he say yes remember what time you were taking us through Bible studies you remember the last day there's going to be Resurrection Jesus said you are pushing the resurrection forward I that I'm studing now I am the resurrection the life whoever believe in me though he were dead yes shall he live believe I leave it shall never die believe this while they were talking then matter went I call Mary and when he told me the master has come and is calling you those denomination with they follow her they say we are going to see drama now we have be feeding him we have be is CLO taking care of him we send message our brother was sick not that they didn't see they saw him first time they saw second time the man died today is the fourth day that he what is he coming to do we know that Mary is going to give give him a pce of her mind Christian don't behave like that they were disappointed when Mar go said Master if you have been here our brother will not have died he said show me where you bury him when he saw everybody cry he also was crying that is Jesus I think that's one of the shortest verse in the Bible Jesus went he said weep with those that weep and rejoice with those that he knew what he was going to do so they took him there where they bury him with Big Stone on uh that they used to seal it there something happened Jesus said father I will not have prayed this prayer if not because of those people studing here I know you have heard me for their sake I am praying after he finished prayer he said remove the stone matter the matter that said even what you ask God even now we know he will do it no Revelation what she said he said Master today is the fourth day you remove it you CA epidemic because by now it should be sticky Jesus has to preach a little Salon have I not told you that if you believe you will see the glory of God have you not heard what Mary told those servs whatever whatever he say do it when they remove the stone he said Lazarus come for a man the prophet told before they before they bury somebody he said Lazarus was Abed he told us something about abing I believe you because the prophet said it he said they have to remove the blood in P body remove water put chemical for preservation all those were done for Lazarus but the only language Jesus spoke was Lazarus come forth all the body have need of to Jesus was not a Jew he was not a was not a Samaritan je of the Old Testament is the Lord Jesus Christ of the Lazarus came up they did say rush to the testive Care Unit to test whether he has enough water in the body of blood no he was Hil and Hearty hallah do you know those people that came that have be pretending their sympathizing with Mary and M many of them were anointed they went back to their denomination to report they said this is what Jesus has done people say Jesus did that okay we will prepare and go there when we get there we know if we kill Lazarus leave Jesus alone he will raise him again when we get there we kill Lazarus we also kill Jesus see what we are saying may God help us praise God amen amen Jesus did so many things that he has no rival among religious leaders he doesn't have a rival when he was he say I have power to lay down my life and I have power to take it again amen no other man has ever spoken like that that is why When They Crucified him buried him the religious and they say let us see let you should go and watch that place so you know that deceiver said that he will raise again the third the third day so that the the second error will not be worse than the first error both the first and the second were not error they were fulfillment of scriptures they said solders to go there and watch the Sant were there watching when Jesus those again they were Witnesses they ran to go and give answer no report to those who said that they said the man rose from the dead we were we were like dead people when we saw it the Bible say they were giv large money you talk about bribery bribery is not just it have be on for long they give their large money they say you should say that when you were sleeping his disciples came to take his body you see lie each time you tell a lie there's a loo that will show that you were Aly if they have said when we were sleeping we don't know what happened to the body it would have be pardonable but it specifically says his disciples came to take his body can you see where you are sleeping praise God Amen the word of God is true forever settled in heaven [Music] today some of the Jewish people they still repeat that same thing the disciples that came to seal his body he rose from the dead and is alive Hallelujah that is why I like I was all the religious leaders that have their religious followers and the rest of them they died and they buried their gra are there but the gra where Jesus was buried he said yeah the one they put there is living in my soul that is what changed my character what Chang me from a smoker from a from a foolish Bo to what I am today oh glory to God who isto the oh oh who is [Music] the am the god none is like the Glorious in Holiness fearful in PR always do Church the prophet said the greatest miracle that can happen to man is the conversion of his soul he said God raised the dead he raised Lazarus now that's finally died we remember the case of what do you call it now gyrus gyrus was a secret believer he believed Jesus because but because of the tith every week the prophet said he could not identify with him because the salary was receiving from his denomination will I leave this morning if you're a child of God anything that in between you Andes Jesus you will choose Jesus amen amen finally finally God allow sickness to struck his daughter they called the best doctors they did the best they could the more they tried the worse the sickness become when the doctors find out that hey let us confess the Hest honest honest honest truth is is is good for the soul gyus we are sorry Reverend this child cannot make it when had that he knew that Jesus was Master of all situations am he just dress up they say daddy where are you going he say I'm going to look for Jesus situation will come than you will come out of your share yes to look for Jesus Jesus when he went he met he said Master said come to my house my daughters at the point of death it's okay I will follow you you know Jesus he pay he he respect all his appointments he doesn't promise our fa even when he know you have invited to come and mock him like Simon the leper he waits as they were on their way coming a message came hey Master don't disturb Master again your daughter don't die already because they only knew him as a Healer but know him is the resurrection and the life himself said don't wor he's already dead immediately Jesus had that he looked at gyus do you still believe me I told you let's go if you believe all shall be well yes when they get to the house the people were there they were weeping crying the daughter of the pastor have died everybody was weeping Jesus came say what is all this noise about the D say is not dead he's sleeping the people that was cry just now they turn into laughter they say what they told us that you are B now it's a confirmation we were witness when that girl die you say it's not dead he sleeping but whatever Jesus says he proves it am he put all of them outside he entered with the daddy and the mommy he said do you still believe me he said yes he only T the dam say I say unto you arise the girl came back to life the people were talking rubbish they were surprised when the G came came out from the room with Jesus Christ praise oh brothers and sisters amen is the AL know we are not following div We are following the truth the gospel is the truth we used to sing that song we are traveling on the right Tru we are TR on the right TR predestin is the mystery Reve we enter on the right Tru when God said a messenger and you see the vations of God SS and wonders are Supernatural be careful you better keep quiet if you don't know what to say amen because you can bring you can bring that Nation to yourself remember the case of Moses when Moses and and Aon were going to the Palace to talk to Pharaoh I wonder where K finally when they were given to go ahead to go come and see K come and see that come and see the Bible say they were men among them brother said they were ministers amen amen they were ministers they came every day Moses Moses Moses is he only Moses God can also talk to us Moses do not make him what he was God make him what he was we did not make our what we are God make us what we are we will not keep quiet we will testify of the goodness of the Lord amen we were wor Sinners but now we are Saints God changed our lives whe the devil like it he doesn't like it we will so Testify the devil will be ashamed of himself praise God amen amen hallelujah now what I we say immediately that Happ Moses went to God he said go he said go to the camp I made the proclamation who is on the Lord's Side if you on the Lord's Side come behind me of course the Bible say it was a Mis multitude so they can EAS be divided all right the C was divided so line up behind K so line up behind AB so line up behind said if this man die natural death then I am not set from God that was the first time M barrier took place the grave was not done with Digger and Sh Supernatural God opened the heart swallow all of them close it amen that is why when you want to talk brother I have some people talking rubbish and all you have to be very careful right from a right from the back where was seven that is where God started talking to him he didn't make up anything the signs and wonders and miracles that were following that Ministry were not done in America alone right anywhere he goes they follow what does God confirm right what does God vindicate is the error no oh Hallelujah that even the ministry of the son of man Des the thought of the heart T of thousands of time no ever fail yes sir one time he had a meeting and he was talking deign he was talking to a woman he said your name is like this this is the house number you have so so sickness he said but you are healed now there was a woman there who knew the house of that woman that it was not the number of the house she knew that the prophet quoted immediately they close the woman went and made the way he said but you should have told that that man of God that he was strong he said no the man of God is Not day for yesterday we move it to this new house hallelujah oh blessed be that is why I keep saying if the people are saying that brother Abraham is strong who can be right I what to be the evidence of that person God who ask us to respect and honor his Prophet told us what we should watch out for that's right am look the people are doing that because they must go to where they come from right where the Prophet was explaining Malachi 4 he said remember it's a promise that this Elijah Will T the heart of the children he said remember it's only children that will list right I than God that I'm one of the children I listen I will not to rubish he say say what the T says that is why this question of playing tape at home and not having a password it's not the it's not in the tape are you following me I thank God for Jose because God used him to spread this message all over the World God will bless him for it but as what is in the T I will listen to what is in the T that what any other man says but AB told us in Ephesian 4 that the fivefold Ministries they are predestinated by God right amen and the went IE to say that the is it how call them something of the Wardrobe of the Bri the dressing wear of the right then you are call me now you say people should not preach the only praye it's not in the tape while the prophet was preaching B was at home preaching he told us that the oh how wish I have time I have somewhere the message total Deliverance theing of the Apostle the functioning of the Prophet the functioning of what do you call him now Evangel teacher and Pastor he told us they foring let me tell you something the C of telling us that he told us the Apostle is over all all of them he also make comment on the teacher he said the teacher can p scriptures and put them together that even the pastor cannot touch him are you following me yes is it stop there he told us don't miss Ministries there somebody is coming from somewhere I said we should no longer have all those Ministries they should keep quiet they should see there it's not in the tape right me I will take what is in the tape rather than what you said I don't care who you are that say it the tape is our absolute yes sir amen amen amen the tap is our absolute yes and the prophet told us what is who receive TI now they bring TI for you you said they should put them in the foundation no the ti is for the is for the pastor the ministers that's what the that's what is in the T are you following me that is what is in the T in the Old Testament know I mean like when Joseph was in what you call Egypt he was put in charge of physical food you are are Joseph this spiritual now God put you in ch to distribute it just distribute don't tell us what is inside the Holy Ghost will tell us what is inside are you following me that's my stand you know when I say I remain loyer I'm loyal to Christ I'm loyal to the message I'm loyal to the bride anything that is not in me I will not believe it so people are preaching there is eight mess an error Jesus interpreted that thing in Revelation 1 he was stud the mid of the seven coding candles on his right hand were Seven Stars right Jesus said the Seven Stars are the seven angels to the seven churches that's right if you divide seven by seven now one you don't need to be educated before you know that in the days of the voice right of the seventh agel when he singular shall begin to sound the M oh Hallelujah Church oh my and the elect cannot be deceived do you know why the elect cannot be deceived not only they recognize the message the one that brought the message which is God is come to live in death amen amen amen God revealed that mystery he say it's no longer that live but Christ live in me Christ cannot be living in you you be do you follow error right you will not follow error Jesus said how be it that when it come the spirit of Truth he shall guide you to all truth that's right amen God bless you I say God bless you if you tell me you say at home now you are playing T you know long go to an assembly you don't need or even the wedding they had to be playing brother to do wedding those things are eror but AB told us something he said when M Luther protested Roman Catholic I go free he said that was not the only Miracle he said the very miracle was that M was able to hold his head straight in the midst of fanaticism that follow his message yeah that's right Church of the Living God and I Rejoice with you because you have a pastor he's grounded in the word I know that I'm not saying it for anything he because the prophet told us if you have anything to say about a man say it in his presence not after he's G you can trust him right oh my is the if
