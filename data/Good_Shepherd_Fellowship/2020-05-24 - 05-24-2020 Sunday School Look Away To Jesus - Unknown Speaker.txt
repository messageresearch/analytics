========================================

do you see that he was wounded for our transgressions with the stripes we were healed when you look away can you see that or can you just see one side of the atonement can you see both sides of it when you look if you look at through the Creed they'll tell you the days of healing is past but if you look at through the word you'll see he's the same yesterday today and forever the disciples looked to him when they were in a trouble see and they saw the only help that could help him coming Martha look to him in a time of death and she saw he was a resurrection in the life amen in time of death Martha saw when she looked at him he had been rejected by her people he had been turned down even she had sent for him and he did not come to her brother but when finally he come and she went and fell down so she could look at him she found out that he was both resurrection and life a man jiraiya stood the same thing a secret believer a little Presbyterian methodist baptist that really believed but couldn't get around on the count of his denomination with let him because he'd be excommunicated but he's only little daughter lay at the part of death and he had to go but when he found him he found out that he was a resurrection in life when he sent farmer runner come and said don't trouble the master or the girl he's already dead he and his little heart almost failed but he said did not I say if you'll only believe you'll see the glory of God dries found out that he could raise up today and when he looked at Jesus the hungry looked to him and found sustaining food for life that was natural the hungry spiritual can look to him and find out he's the bread of life the dyeing feet look to see what he could see and he found in Jesus's porn remember me Lord when thou comest into that kingdom jesus said today shalt thou be with me in paradise that's what he saw in the hour of his death the sick look dream and saw the healer the blind look and could see depends on what you're looking at now what do you look Peter and Nathanael looked and seen the promised word other prophet Moses made manifest the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me and to him the people shall clean and all that don't believe him and hear that prophet will be cut off from the people and when Peter walked up into his presence Jesus said your name is Simon and you are the son of Jonas he knew right then when he looked the first time all Jesus that there was a fulfillment of what the Word of God said he'd be hey I wonder if you found the same thing when you looked at him for the first time I wonder if the promise word manifest itself to you when you looked at him Nathanael as soon as he come into the presence of Jesus a little bit and down we find out that Philip had went and told him come see who we found and Nathanael come and he said which one is he he said probably someone up there praying for the sick he pressed his way through to get a look at him and when he looked Jesus said Behold an Israelite and whom there's no guy he said rabbi when did you ever know me he said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you then what didn't attain you'll find he found out that there was the king of Israel he said thou art the son of God you are the king of Israel that's what he saw when he looked he got the interpretation of the scripture brought to light before him he saw it the same scripture that the anointed prophet Moses had said he will be a prophet likened unto me the woman at the well she got a look one time and what did she see she expressed it in the city she said come see a man who told me that things are done isn't this the very Messiah when she took her first look at Jesus Christ she saw the Messiah people can look at the same thing today and call it mental telepathy they have College spiritualism they'll call it any kind of devil mean they can call it because they don't know what they're looking for a man I don't understand they're looking for greed they're looking for our genius to set the church in order they're looking for more members and fail to see the Blessed Lord Jesus Christ it is identified word rang depends on what you're looking for if you're looking for the fulfillment of the promise of today you'll see it but if you're looking for some interaction or something that they've always looked for some great found or some historian some other person something else you'll fail to see it but when you look at him through the word the word declares who yes he challenged the people of his days to do the same they conceived he said you blind leaders of the blind you clean Moses to be your prophet if you have known Moses you ignore me Moses wrote about me and they were too glad to sit looking right at it and too blind to sin I'm dovetailing that glare this morning for a few minutes you see they're looking and don't know what they're looking for because they've got the wrong conception of what you're trying to find how would you know what you wanted to find if you didn't know what you was looking for how would you go hunt for a pumpkin and you never seem on an ever heard one how would you go find a watermelon if you never know there was such a thing in hot look why you could find a tub and think it was a watermelon you can find something else you could find a block and think it was a watermelon but you've got to know what you're looking for and the only way you'll never know what you're gonna what you're looking for if you're looking for Jesus you'll look to the word for he is the word they are they that testify of me search the Scriptures yeah you claim you are the believers of the prophets but you're your father the devil your father's you claim when God sent the promised tomb he put him in the grave they they kill the prophets every one that comes G zhis said which one of your father's didn't stone and the works of your father you do P man righteous man holy man a man that you come to put a finger on and yet he called him serpents and devils what are you looking for if you're looking for some pious person some people thinks it because the Holy Spirit would work to you you'd have to be some long spies feller walk around and not even that's not the Holy Spirit God don't deal to angels like that are supposed to be God deals you man the Bible said Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are but you couldn't be with him till you seen Jesus Peter and John at the gate called beautiful and when they pulled him up there about healing that man they perceived that they were ignorant unlearned it but the also perceived that they had been with Jesus because his life was reflecting through them now depends on what you're looking for the woman had read the Bible she know there was a coming Messiah and she know what that Messiah would do and as soon as Jesus said to her bring me a drink she said it's not customary he's just an ordinary man now if he'd been sitting there was a great big turban on and all kinds of armlets over him of some holy person well the woman had said well there's a priest and went on or there's some copper rabbi went on minister something that I've seen a man come to eat today where I went to eat and that fella come in here you had enough crosses and things on you it's a good thing sometimes then fellows had that I think you're to live a life you don't have to have a lot of clergy clothes to prove what you are sometimes they drink carry on so much to smoke cigarettes and everything that's where clergy clothes even over there a minister or not that's trying I'll tell you the clergy clothes for a man to wear is the baptism of the Holy Spirit that'll identify you as being with Jesus now we find out there depends on what you're looking for a well-dressed Rael groom some kind of a turban you'll never see him because he was just an ordinary man God deals with man Jesus was a man God was in the man and he was gone now we find out that this woman when she saw this mysterious sign that he could tell her what she had done that was wrong or what was on her heart she knew right then that was the Messiah so when she looked at Jesus she saw the Messiah the Messiah what was the works of the Messiah we know the secret of the heart did that catch you right I wonder if you'll understand if you look for him tonight what would you look for you'd be the same the Messiah is the word the word and the Bible said in Hebrews the fourth chapter that the Word of God is quicker more powerful than a two-edged sword cutting even to the Sun or bone and aid Cerner of the thoughts that's in the heart and when she know that Messiah was to be that word made manifest and he could tell her what was wrong with her she knowed that was Messiah not how he's dressed not how much education he had but by the sign that he shoulder he was Messiah when she saw Jesus she saw the Messiah God in a man as promised for that anointed age but you know what many of them same age that I have spoke of never seen that thing many of them didn't see it same today granny didn't recognize Moses Manny didn't recognize Elijah many did they never recognized it till they're gone then they recognized it the unbelievers seen in the days of Noah only what did the unbelief look at I've told you what to believers saw now let's see what the unbeliever saw in the days of Noah what did the unbeliever saw see back there when they look they saw a fanatic blundering around on a so-called boat that's all they saw some crazy old man the long white whiskers that had lost his mind and against scientific research and proof said this water up there well poor old fellow they felt sorry for him passing by he'll be declared insane soon he's lost his mind but he had the word of the Lord he was building away on it and God was showing evidence that the flood was coming it was a sign to them them who did not believe nor story wandered on into darkness and ended up and death in the water and a grave of hell they ruled he looked one time what did he saw why I saw Pharaoh he's seen a fanatic so-called prophet with many so-called claims of deliveries that's only saw a mud dauber a slave standing up amongst the people and saying himself a son of God to perform miracles while they thought they fell or lost said go let him rave on came in seen in July but he had thus saith along the believers Aaron Joshua and many haven't seen God in Moses and the works of God Moses done that's the reason they know God was in him they looked and saw God in Moses the rich man looked and seen exactly who he was see but he refused to follow him because he loved the things of the world too much to follow Jesus how many are rich man well listen to this tape of that time don't have to be always rich in money no you can be rich and lust rich and pleasures of this life how many men how many young girls how many young boys will not sell out their popularity some sex queen are some Ricky with a badge or guitar poor not entertaining some rock and roll or some dance that he's able to do how many of clean that riches of popularity and refused when they set like the meetings and what's the hand of God move into Clary's word how many will do it he chose his denomination he could live by Jesus was a fanatic to his denomination so he had either take what Jesus said or either he had to take why didn't he go to his priests and say what can I do to have eternal life you know the priests know nothing about it so he come to Jesus and said what can I do jesus said keep the commandments taught it right back his left he said I've done this he said keeping the commandments and he still didn't have eternal life any note he didn't you can keep all the commandments he have got eternal life yet so jesus said now if you want to do what's right go sell what you got and give it to the poor come follow me that was too much for anything we find out that he looked and seen who he was but yet refused to take it and his next look was in hell looking away up and send Lazarus in the bosoms of Abraham pilot looked one time when they brought him he never seen him for his hands tied blood running out of his back a crown of thorns on his head Pilate looked and was convinced because a horse come galloping down the street and a rider jumped off and run over said here's a wife have sent you a letter and he looked at it and she said Pilate my beloved husband have nothing to do with that just man for today I've suffered many things in a dream because I mean he trembled his knees beat together and he said if you are the son of God if you're the king why don't you speak out are you the king of Israel he said you have said it that tell us truth he said to this end I was born and Pilate marvelled he all everybody was begging and crying at his feet he said I have power to kick your I have power to release he said you have power of nothing lesson he gives you in my father sir he was convinced so that was more than a man he was fairly convinced that it was more than a man certainly he was a what his politics and popularity was too great the he turned him down his popularity was too great the politics his position in life was too great to accept this for any wonder how many pilots will be listening to this that's your position in some denomination will be too great to accept the real Lord Jesus standing in the position that he is today the Roman soldier at the cross looked on Jesus after the earth had had a nervous prostration shook to the rocks wrung out of the mountains and there's someone out of the middle of a and turned dark the stars didn't come out to give its life in the earth burst forth with rocks and earthquake the zigzag line you swept the skies and ripped the temple to from the top to the bottom and people running to screaming they didn't want to take it place that Roman soldier that helped nailing their had punched the sword to his heart then he looked what was too late he looked and believed but it was too late for him to believe what he had done had sealed his doom he had run the spirit through the Savior's heart it was too late I wonder how many Romans today has done the same thing and will do the same thing you might look some day but it might look too late many of the day will come and that day and be the same way they have known brother woods your yesterday saying this is close it's in this message down your slider company a Roman Catholic setting there he went out and get some concrete for the church here and when he did he's told him where he wanted par the Roman Catholic studies that brother branham yes he said I say one thing when he prays God answers they wonder then knowing it seeing the vindication that is truly the gospel not me any man representing Christ a word we're talk about not man what am I trying to say is this that they see there clearly a vindicated word like power than the rest of them did like the Roman soldier but are you going to wait too late to do anything about it you should have used the spear the other way the doors will be closed like it was in the days of Noah and then it's too late you might wake up some morning say I intend to get out of this mess don't wait too long you better look and live now Luther looked away from the Catholic denomination what did he see a pillar of fire he saw an independent church Wesley looked away from the angle and denomination he saw the same thing the Pentecost looked away from all the denominations what did he become a great mighty people what did each one of them do when the founders Luther and Wesley mm and when they looked away and saw what they didn't start out their children come in behind him look back to where they come from out of the denomination took that group of people right back into the same mess at the came out of what are you looking at the founders look right but the people followed him look back to what the founders come out of her and had done exactly what the founders was against the Anointed One of God you know I got a hurry cause I got a prayer line coming in and whole menu has to travel one day I took a look I saw the word made flesh I saw the Alpha and Omega I never seen any three four or five I saw word I saw him as my savior I saw him the world I saw him the life I straighten the mighty God I've seen God in him I saw the pillar fire I saw in him exactly what the Bible said he was I saw that he was the Alpha and Omega there was a pillar of fire he was the same yesterday forever I saw that the pillar of fire said to John is never failing presence as he said in John oh there is never failing presence will never leave you brother my opinion tonight sing that song looking live my brother live look to Jesus now and live or it's recorded in his word hallelujah it's only that you look and live look what do you see do you see delivers do you see what he is look to the word and see what he was then you look through the same word to see he's the same today as he was and he is the anti for the brass serpent in the wilderness for the same cause sin and sickness Judas Tucker look one day and when he looked after he took a real look at him you'd only been looking at the treasure before that the pot of money the hand but one day when he looked and seen Jesus you know what he seen he's seen he was guilty he's seen that he wasn't fit to live any hungee cell one morning with all the greatest mornings in the all history of time enclosing him saying this there's something happening into Jerusalem and all that once the bunch of soldiers came down to the jail I hear the jingle other the chains you're the dragging on the spear on the street who's back in there Barabbas he's ready to die he's a thief he's no good he's a robberies a murder he's going to die first thing you know he said well this is all over for me I'll be executed this morning the first thing you know the guard open the door step out BRABUS he stepped out and said well I guess this is the end he said BRABUS you're absolutely free what I'm what I'm absolutely free you're free I said so how can I be free he says what come here BRABUS look up there you see that man dying up there he took your place I wonder if we all tonight to look and see what Brava saw someone taking our place he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace is upon him and with His stripes I was healed you were healed wonder if we either guilty ones who should be sick can see in him our deliverance you should go to hell seeing him your freedom your pass to heaven wonder if you can see what BRABUS saw on that day he said a little while and the world won't see me no more yet ye shall see me o Church then if he said you shall see me it's proof that you can look again you'll see me or I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world why how do you see him at the word he is the word look at the word and see what two promises for he's the same yesterday today and forever what he was when he walked in Galilee is the same is tonight in Jeffersonville the same thing he is at the Branham Tabernacle what do you look to see a founder a denominational man you'll never sit in Jesus do you look to see some great priestly you'll never see it in Jesus no how do you see Jesus by the Word of God being made manifest because he was a manifested Word of God what he was then he is tonight and will be forever let's bow our heads just a moment I'll cut this off kind of shortly Lord Jesus is my prayer let me look away from the cares of life Lord I know we're just a common people uneducated we have not much of this world's goods but we love you Lord and I'll speak for this people they were not set in a place like this a squeeze and mashing around in the crowds and set burning up in the heat are freezing in the cold and standing it and bringing their children and them sick and the afflicted coming around if they come here to see anything else besides you those people Lord would never come to see a man there's plenty of man on the street they all look alike but they come to see that man that man of God that Jesus of Nazareth a flesh being gone now father you have told us that a little while in the world would not seen him or no matter how much they look they'll never see it but you said ye shall see me the true believer because I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world you promised us if we look we would see and I pray tonight that you'll fulfill that scripture to us again tonight that we might look and see Jesus making himself known to us in the same way that he always has fulfilling his word from henceforth Lord and I made a statement before this and I've truly said these things from my heart about the pools and that you told me and now as mysterious as it may seem if we could only pitch our inner conscience and see that those things could not be foretold perfectly as they are unless it did come from God how could we see that first thing take place how could the second take place how could the third take place how could we stand here months before happened and tell what would take place in Tucson and would open up the seven seals and bring back the mystery and reveal the hidden things of God that's been here since the beginning of time and to see it both testified witness scientifically-proven Lord you're our refuge and strength you're all that we have and I thank you for Lord being a part of this great economy of yours thank you for being a member of your body along with many here who are members of that body many all out through the world in different churches that are members of that mythical body of Christ every time we look we see seem on the Bird Sings seem on the Sun rises or when it sets here even the songs watching minis people seem of indicating his word oh Lord you're our God early will we call upon thee thou art our merciful Father forgive us of our wrongs Lord we're at the end time I see the doors will soon be closed the doors of opportunity and while it is daylight and I can still get into some of these places lord help me to go I'm getting old give me strength renew my youth Lord help me that I might do something out there now that I'm waiting for this great time to come that will be here help me Lord is a go out that I might be able under some way that catch that lice predestinated seed that will bring back the Lord Jesus help Oh God if I'm laying a foundation that another shall stand upon grant Lord that soon it'll happen that the word might be fulfilled our hearts desire is to see your word fulfill we love you we believe you in the midst of an unbelieving doubting people a generation of what we got today Lord God we still believe that your word will never fail we believe that heavens and earth will pass away but it shall never fail we stand gallantly or that now father to this little group that's waited there's many sick in here and there may be unsaved in here people have been saved and yet hasn't been filled with the Holy Ghost Lord God may you come so on the scene by your word of promise that the people will look and see Jesus and then bow down and give their hearts to him may the sick look and see that it's impossible for anything else to be doing it only God because it is his word promise what we have said today both messages may it be confirmed now it's all in your hands Lord and I'm in your hands and the the congregations in your hands work through a slore to honor your great name Oh eternal one grant this for their glory of
