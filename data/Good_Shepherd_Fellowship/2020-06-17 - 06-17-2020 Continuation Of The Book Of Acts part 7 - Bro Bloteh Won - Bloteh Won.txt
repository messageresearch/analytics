tonight let's turn over to you as chapter 3 continuing in the book of ads I'm hope you are you are reading alone [Music] praise Lord we might not be able to make comment on every verse because we're not actually doing a commentary we just trying to be able to spend time and go through the book of art so if you have the time just read the chapter you know meditate upon it I believe the Holy Spirit can be able to bring more of what we want to share with you but tonight as Chapter three we will begin from verse one now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth owl and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful 2ax arms of them they enter into the temple all seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple acts of am impeded fasting his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave he to them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give ID in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and anger bones received strength and he and he leaping up stood and walk and enter with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God and all the people saw him walking in praising God and they knew that it was he which sad for arms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they will fill with Wonder and amazement at that wish have happened to him praise the Lord let's stop right here let's pray Heavenly Father we just actually a blessing upon your word tonight and we ask that Lord Jesus you will bring an inspiration out of this tonight father and bless our hearts O God we love you we appreciate you we glorify your holy name in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord I will read a little bit down and from verse 11 and as the lame man which was he you hell Peter and John all the people ran together unto them to the pole that is called Solomon greatly wandering and when Peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of Israel why Marvel year this or while look he is so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we have made this man work the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the god of Our Fathers have glorified His Son Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let him go but he denied the Holy One and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and killed the Prince of life whom God had raised from the dead where of we are witnesses and his name through faith in his name have made this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him have given him the perfect soundness in the presence of you all and now brethren I would that true anger as he did it as did also our rulers but those things which God before have shown by the mouth of all his prophets that Christ should suffer he have so fulfil repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord amen tonight uh for the Wednesday night just by the weight of an inspiration I want to take the little top there in verse in verse four word Peter the scripture says and Peter fasting his eyes upon him with John said look on us amen I want to take those three words tonight use it for the subject and we continue with this series of the bulk of adds brother Branham in efficient church age we have read this he used this word in a vision church age he says look up wish of course bird brain mourning over his face it means behold he says look up behold him who is even now walking in the midst of the church through all ages before him who is the same yesterday today and forever and who never changes either in essence or in his ways were two or three I gather together in his name there he is in VMs now burr Branham using this is trying to to to bring a realization to us because over and over brother Branham says when when Peter and John says look on us they were actually calling the attention of the man that he should be able to look at them to grab his attention and we're Bellamy used that I was just looking at that a few minutes ago he used that over and over in the prayer line he says just like Peter said to that man at a gate a beautiful look on us I'm saying look at me what's he trying to do get the attention of the man contact his spirit but so yeah brother branham also is trying to bring us to a realization that we must look up before him who is even now walking in the mists of the churches throughout the ages wish of course that's what we are talking about the book of Acts which is the the continuation of the book of asked Christ in in the church Christ in the New Testament church that's what we're Branham said is the continuation of the book of Acts so we want to behold him just like he said here he gave us a promise where two or three are gathered in his name there he is indium is not not only in their midst as a compressing on local all as a recording angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and and giver of all good gifts to the church hallelujah that's what he said now so we realized here he is bringing us to this realization that we have we have to pay attention and we also have to we have to grab the view of the one that is in the midst of the church even though we are not in our building wish of course the church is not the building the church is the call out people we are the church so where we gather two or three in our home if it is just you and the wife in and and and the children Christ have promised to be in our mess so we have to come to that realization to behold his presence to be able to recognize his presence that's what I want to kind of a make emphasis on tonight as we go ahead he says walking walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks how mindful of those words when view in the light of the scripture which described him as Christ who is our life for Christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life without him she is simply a religious society a club a meaningless gathering of people a cop's bejeweled and dress a state account so the church no matter what her programs in an aggressive effort may achieve with a Christ she is a cop's awesome but with him in her miss with him motivating her she becomes tall she becomes tall the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all and this very hour he is walking in the midst of the last Age golden candlestick what is what he was as he walked in the first age he is even now in this last age and Burnham is identifying him what he was in the first age Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord so we realized here a stream as we travel on with with this subject of the book of Acts they have they have received the Holy Ghost and those men that were that were so fearful now in talking about this as I was thinking about it and and and meditating upon it brother Branham said he says in the prayer line he said spirit and James said look on us in other words is to attract attention he used the same thing also in a message what is that in your hand now you gnorm like Peter and John passed through the gate called beautiful and said look on us see look on us now look at them as him but just to give attention to what they were saying catch the attention of the Spirit they wanted to grab the attention of the spirit now this is what out this is what I was thinking about as I as I was reading true the message and just thinking about this tonight now Peter and Peter James and John you have to realize this man they were all there that night when Jesus was was being questioned when he was taken down out there and they were questioning him and the very night of the of of the betrayal and the Bible says that all his disciples went away from him that's why the scripture says and the scripture also led us to know that a few different times three times the pointed out Peter and says are you now one of one of them at that time Peter a slob look at me yeah I'm one of them no he says I don't even know this man he denied the Lord Jesus now so what has happened this time what has happened this time something really has happened something has changed his life that he was conscious of Peter knew that now he was possessing something that he never had in he was now possessing something that he can tell that that man there had a get a beautiful look at me look at me I want your attention praise the Lord can you tell somebody look at me I believe we should be at that place what we can say it is not me and I live it is Christ I look very mean just look at my life I used to be this now His grace has helped we're going to look at something here in a little bit now so we realized that I mean period even the scripture says when when they realize that this is the man that has been the Bible said to carry him they would tour him they'd bring him right to that place to set him down he bared forearms in the evening they come and gather him back they take him back to the house I mean he has been there years after years and after years they would do the same thing everybody know him but this day is going to be different praise the Lord this man has received the promise of the father they have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost so tonight just looking at this thought oh look on us I'm trying to bring us to the place that we have to realize what we have received the Holy Ghost is not a doctrine the Holy Ghost is more than a teaching because he is the teacher he's more than the teaching he's more than a church believe he more than a feeling he's more than an emotion the Holy Ghost is nothing less than God himself praise the Lord the Holy Ghost is not T less than God himself that's the realization that brother Branham was trying to bring to us here in the efficient church age when he said look up God is trying to grab our attention church that this holy ghost that is dwelling in our midst the Holy Ghost that we are submitting ourself home the one that we are obeying the one we are believing the world we are allowing to live in our life is nothing less than God himself praise the Lord to make the Holy Ghost and if less than God that's the mark of the beast you have missed the Mac and better Benham says that's what sin is to just stop the holy ghost on an experience stop the Holy Ghost on a mentor conception a belief system you have mr. Mac you have to believe that this is nothing but God himself that has come down that has choose to associate his self with us we don't need to be afraid of it we have to be proud we have to be very grateful that God in His mercy has called you and myself from our past and all of the things that we have gone through we have failed him we have failed he pickup up he has given us grace and mercy it is nothing less than God himself he's the one that is in our midst because he is the one that have been in the midst of the seven golden kind of steak before him he's the same one that would come down in the cool of the evening and was walking in the garden when the Bible said the voice of God world in the Garden of Eden it was nothing less than God Himself the one that worked with the prophets that reveal himself in a life of a Daniel Jeremiah and Elijah and all this prophet he's nothing less than God himself and if we start becoming conscious of this reality now you're not just dealing with the church you are not just dealing with brother branham belief system you are not just dealing with a good Good Shepherd as a church you are dealing with God himself this is God himself the Bible you are holding in your hands is God in preacher form you have to believe that everything was made by him without him there was nothing made that is made and in everything that he made he revealed himself in it I'm trying to say to us tonight we are dealing with God himself this message of the hour the purpose of this message is to reveal God himself to you he is the principle team of the Bible he is the Alpha he's the Omega he's through it all better Branham says if we read it and we don't see God himself go back and read it again before him who is even now walking in the midst of the church through our other ages before him who is the same yesterday today and forever he's trying to grab our attention people this is that this is the God that spoke the word into existence the very one that called the word into existence praise the Lord I believe that's what Peter and John men when they told a man look at us look on us look on us you might have know me to be a fisherman you might have know me to be a disciple of Jesus or right now look look on us if we are conscious that we are dealing with God and as God is the invisible God that is making himself visible in our if we get to to be conscious of that it is net you trying to be a better Christian you will feel it is now you trying to be a good husband or a good wife or a good young brother or a good young sister that was the reason why the God of heaven and earth he had to come in a form of a blood meeting with one exhales he has to come in a form of of a baby and that is the reason why last week I was trying to bring out of the scripture John the Baptist Eve the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb Elizabeth received the Holy Ghost an experience of the Holy Ghost being conceived with child Zachariah received the Holy Ghost in the temple so which mean God measure it out right from the warm all the way to the grave we can have access of the Holy Ghost from the womb to the grave no excuse there is no excuse and that is the reason why we have to be teaching our children praying for them they are not too small to receive the Holy Ghost from the womb straight to the grave no excuse Elijah bone was lying in the grave when you put a deal me in a grave he came back to life because the quickening power was in that grave why all of these things is too sure that a warm that we are dealing with it's not a belief system it's God Himself that is making himself real in our mess if you believe that this Holy Ghost is God himself you must believe that he is your creator he knows everything about you so you cannot you cannot deceive the holy ghost if you come to the realization that you are dealing with God himself there is no room to pretend because he's your maker he knows the limit of your strength he knows how much you can take he knows what you are hiding behind in all the way that Adam took effect leave he said Adam Adam where are you that question where are you means he was hiding somewhere so he knows where we are in our work he knows where we are in our understanding if we come to the place to realize that it is God himself we will be so grateful we will be so grateful so appreciative of the saving grace that we have received he's the one that is walking in the midst of the seven golden candle stick the same way he walked with Adam the same way he walked with Enoch he has choose to walk with us he has choose to come in our home he has choose to come in our home look on us praise the Lord let's pay attention to that church the one that we have dealing with tonight is God himself Seibert Bram says something here in deity of Jesus Christ he says and that same power that that same Christ hallelujah led the fundamentalist let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same power there spoke the word into existing is in those people that God the Holy Ghost praise the Lord maybe you are looking at the worse you are trying to understand the English but you think about there he says the same power the same power that spoke the world into existence it's in those people they have the Holy Ghost the same power praise the Lord you see that's the reason why the bride the believers stand as a protection to the earth because the power that is holding this word in its orbit it's in you that's what Jesus said greater is He that is in you the heater is in the world amen are we together the very same power that spoke this word into existence that power is in you he says it's in those people that got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women it is time that we find out who we are and you will never know who you are until you really come to conscious of he that is in you when we start cherishing the one that is in us the one that wake us up wake us up in the morning and realizing that we don't have the keys to our own life in it and the right to do whatever we want to do Moses there in a burning bush he says to God what am I then I should go to Pharaoh God never told him God never answer his question yeah I know you you are Moses you had a son of a merman and Jack you be a god and I answer that question because the secret of Moses Noreen woo he was was in the I am dad I am when Moses asked that question of who I am God did not answer him when he now asked God whoa are you when I get to Egypt I would tell the people then God said I am that I am but BAM says it's time that we find out who you are the devil is trying to hire you back tell you that you are some little cow there are something you are not you are sons and daughters of God and being a son and daughter of God it means that you are an attribute of God it means that you are an amateur God you are God in it in the sense there you are a child of God the DNA is not in heaven it is in you that was the realization that Peter and John came to all when it told them a look on us they came to the realization there is something that was dwelling in them that thing that make you cried when when you when you when you discipline the law that thing that troubles your mind I put you on your knees that make you to lift your hands that make you to sing sounds of praise and you just wash up God the thing that makes you feel so happy in your heart is nothing but God himself praise the Lord like one brother said he says when we use the language young people we make excuse this is a way to make excuses you are young people it means that yeah you can stay fool around your knob that I mean God don't have no grandchildren just like I said from the womb to the grave you have a right to the Holy Ghost God can give the Holy Ghost in a warm he can give it to a young child and he will guide the life of that child until the guests to the place work that life will become real in them praise the Lord is there anything hard for the Lord there is nothing hard for him praise the Lord all young people when we get to that place were we can tell our friends look at my life see how I dress I don't do this because I don't believe it it's not of God I don't glorify God he called us to be a reflection of him he's dwelling in us the reason why he would give a young man the Holy Ghost so that a young male life can be a testimony to other young people God on waita for the age of accountability to wait for the age of 18 years or where where you can you I mean now you are an addict declare you on other the very time the Word of God is birthed in your heart you are an other before God that is the reason why some of our young people can be here more responsible than the people out there in the world it's because the thing that is dwelling in you is nothing less than God we explain the Holy Ghost in justification you know you just when you when you I justify you just you just believing you just believing what makes you believe it's God that makes you believe it's the Holy Ghost in you that takes you from justification to centrifugation from centrifugation to an indwelling where he possesses your body but from the very time where a young try gives you a heart to the Lord it's a it's a field where a seed is planted in and that seed is the life of God it's an incorruptible seed that's what we've done it just allowed the children to go to church with us let ask them whether they have received Jesus Christ because we're Brent says give them to the Lord worthy a young let God get ahold of them before this world get on there from the womb to the grave no excuse the devil is trying to hide you back in saying all you are just young when you get to this place then you will become serious when you get out of high school when you get married but that's when God want your heart that thing that is dealing with you in your heart when you are alone the thing that brings you consciousness that you have done wrong it's God it's the Holy Ghost the more you stop believing that is the holy God that is dealing with your heart the more he will make himself real to you Theater is not in heaven he said deity is in you hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that Almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I gave Jesus said the soul the life of God is in the Hema being when you realize that Almighty God lives in you nothing that there that is your faith it's God realizing that Almighty God lives in you tell yourself that every morning that Almighty God lives in me come to that realization there Almighty God he's living in you praise the Lord ami oh what a what a wonderful thing to know that Almighty God lives in us [Music] praise the Lord amen it's a beautiful thing to know that Almighty God leaving us glory to God I was looking at the scripture and actually the sister titi called me and she was sharing now the testimony and she was reading the scripture and it has to do with the scripture were the strip the Bible says the first step of the righteous is all about the Lord and when he and when he falleth God we uphold him and as we were talking about it this morning we shared a little bit of this with her it's coming to that consciousness because it is it is at a place word we are afraid you know you're afraid to say you have the Holy Ghost because when you make mistake you would think that is not the Holy Ghost he order our footsteps it is where we commit our ways in his hands when we do when we are desiring to do things we committed to him and when he convinced us and lead us that is the right thing to do and we take that thing by faith and we go out and do it and because we we have we have done everything we know right to do we have prayed we have committed in the hands of the Lord we have read the scripture there is no selfish desire in what we want to do the scripture says even when we go and make mistake he will withhold us he will bring us up that's what he's the comforter he's the guide he will lead us into all truth we're branches when we realize that Almighty God live in us do you know what happened just before those disciples received the Holy Ghost after all of these things his resurrection after his resurrection and all of the different things they started seeing and God started opening their mind toward the scripture do you know how they felt sitting there and and enough sense regretting in their heart that he was with us we just took him to be a good teacher now they are realizing that this one that has worked with them three and a half years was nothing but God himself they are sitting there saying oh how I wish I pay attention that day you remember when he was talking about the parable about the kingdom of God we just see in his eyes now they are coming to the understanding and the realization that the worm that was working with him three and a half years they call him the son of David they call him Robert they call him master but they are realizing that this is God himself do you see why when those men received the Holy Ghost they got so desperate they got right into action because they don't want to miss this opportunity again realizing that they miss it the first time how many times Jesus said things to them they just sat down the look at him the Wonder in their mind really they are saying really you are saying that because you know in our situation in and people people do that you know to do that the reason why people we would give our time you know to our work we would be on time for job and even when we are sick we still try to make it to to work is because we believe that our livelihood depend on our job we believe it and that's truth you have to provide for your family you have to I mean provide take care of yourself your your your livelihood depend on the job and because of that it's in the mind of us as hema we woke up in the morning we get our set ready we want to be there on time with because we don't want to supervise your cousin calling us and say well you've been lit this one we I'm gonna give you a note I'm going we do out of that but why why are we holding back when it comes to our spiritual life level we come to church late if we don't even show up to church we don't tell anybody it's nobody business nobody in all my life you know what I mean that it's much you we give all of those excuse in our mind because we have not come to the realization to know that our life player who our internal in destination depend on our attitude to the Word of God when it comes to the things of God we are slothful we're having all the excuses to give can you imagine if God who just get a hold of us and turn our life around and we start to treat the things of God treat our devotion treat our prayer life treat our commitment when we start putting all our faith in the finished work of cavalry and say Lord no matter what the devil no matter how he would treat my life and what he was said about me I've been when you said that there it is finished it was concerning everything of my life you pay the price you are the Lamb of God you died in my place putting our faith in the finished work I was telling that yesterday brother scary just blew my mind I mean to realize how much how much the feeling work the finished work at cavalry means told the believer when you believe in what Christ did for you on the cross and you put your faith in it and I mean every morning you wake up

will see how the benefit of cavalry will start producing in your body many times we rely on our strength and you think that you have the joy of the Lord because you are reading your Bible you are praying your out of that but it's all in the finished work it's all in the finished work that's what Jesus said if I be lifted up and we draw all men unto me that thing just hit me yesterday studying

do it in the morning so I told him I said well okay let the Bible speak for itself let's go in the scripture you know we went through some few things in the scripture and you know and try to show him and word I think the Lord caught his attention I said to him I says when God instituted this under the Passover he told Israel that this is the beginning of months the communion is a new beginning it's a new beginning it's not just a ritual we come talk yeah and then we just take that the the wine and bread it's a new beginning it breaks us into a new day it starts a new life for us and new Kalama new habits not only NASA swen gone started a new beginning from the beginning the Bible says the evening and the morning was the first thing so when he was going to start a new beginning with Israel he said started the evening to the morning that's the first day so it's just not a church ratio what we just come and just take wine and umbrella and and and and you know and know it's a new beginning it must be able to break us into into more love for God more submission to God's Word that's where we come and we commit our habits and say Lord we are lame this habit this line habit on you

when you realize that Almighty God lives in you immortal life that's what verb random says Paul says there in the book of Timothy how in mortality the death of Jesus release immortality to us when Paul says this mortar must put on immortality we keep it for when we die no immortalize comes in a believer the thing that gives you the desire to take highs are going to be like in heaven corruption cannot think about in corruption the thing that is giving you the desire to desire walking on street of God to eat from the tree of life is that dwelling of immortality cus unless you want to make the holy ghost human the Holy Ghost is immortal spirit they can't die it wasn't it never had a beginning and never had an end so for you for us to have the Holy Ghost in us is the present of immortality it's an evidence that we going across the river to a life Elaine where we never get all read Branham says now the church now that was once dress like their little he sees the church now that was one dress like there are little manger experience that we have been true has come to a place now that the people are realizing that deity and the power of Almighty God is living in the human being oh I wish I had no language to speak this thing I wish I had a way to say it I wish I had a way to say it that we are realizing Church we are realizing that deity the power of Almighty God is living don't measure God's power with the weakness of your strength know his strength is made our of tamanna feste manifest his strength in your weakness realizing that dear teh Almighty God your Creator is living in you he can create new habit he can create new desire because the Creator is living in you that's what the Holy Ghost is look on us look on us Peter had a testimony he had a testimony look on us and as the moment he the Bible said he fast in his eyes he fast in his eyes he was looking right in the eyes of man that's a true witness men and women if the Holy Ghost is dwelling in you he says the Christ that was born 1980 came to manhood he's never stayed in a cradle the Christ that was born in the manger has come as a man that's a man oh when the word says give us a man we have the man we have the man the man the scripture says when a man of the house he is the man of this house the scripture said when a good man of the house he is the good man of this house give us good health he give us strength that's part of all the different health issues that are all there running down you know our genetics but the good man of the house he's in control when we realize that he's the good man of this house and we can say look on us to realize that the holy spirit young people we are more than able brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost is our inheritance and then is our inheritance you cannot do without it for a rapture there is no way you can go in the rapture without all egos so the Holy Ghost is our inheritance is our portion it's given to us you know there's a way that brother Branham spoke about it in there in a source imprison and it's very beautiful and that is the reason why he said that the talking message was the highlight of his ministry because it was the life the life is in the blood and it was the life of the animal on display and then the life of the animal was on display before the public the animal was killed and his life was was spread over the doorposts the life of Christ on display that's what the talking is that's what he have caught a stroke but you see it is not in our power it's not like we can do it he just want us to make ourself available he want us to just to just believe total obedience just believe just surrounding our surface and Lord yeah I know it was because of me you went to cavalry he want to put his life on this plane he want you to be Christ on the job he want you to be Christ in your home Christ to the neighbor coming to the realization that a creator of heaven in F the very power that brought the word to it existence it's living in us that is the that is the level that he have caught off to look on us praise the Lord if we just believe that the God that created the heaven in the earth it's living in us you will not be afraid to pray for your friends you will not be afraid to just ask someone let's bow our heads and pray father I commit them into your hands because he don't have no feet for yours no hands for ours no mal he has to speak but you with me but this is the one that is in our maze this is the one that is in our maze we are not trying to be different from the rest of the world we are not trying to make seven god complicated there is no need of doing that I have here people you know this is well you know this message this message is it's not just for everybody it's not just for anybody this message is too hard when we go to that if God would have made this message high you would not be in the message you will not be safe because if God make it high you have to be harder than God to come in just the grace of God if he can save me he can save anybody if he can change my life he can change the life of anybody to know that it's Almighty God the life of God the breath of God coming to the realization that's what the Holy Ghost is it's nothing less than God it's not the first person it's not a tear person making the Holy Ghost that tear person you're making you you reducing God the Holy Ghost is nothing less than Almighty God humbling himself the same God that came in the form of a baby in the manger he said a son a super Sam Jehovah crying crying Jehovah crying and he walked he grew in stature and understanding if we just understand him the Holy Ghost is nothing less than God nothing less than God and if he's dwelling in you I tell you tonight you don't need to break the chair to make him move the hall we did all of those things we banned the word knock our head on the wall Oh God and trying to bring God on the scene he's just right there you don't have to break the bed you

something to go and make a meal he didn't care about what clothes they wear while shoes were on there that was not what he was looking for he never went down there to compared who's having the finest clothes coming to the temple he was hungry he just needed life that's all he needed and I believe that's what the word nee today they just need life there are caught up in all the faction because they are filling their mind with Hollywood but what really Denis is life they are testing for the life of Jesus Christ and God in a humble way has choose you and myself to represent him we just have to believe the thing that is dwelling in us is nothing less than Almighty God you have Almighty God dwelling in you that's the reason why he says when you call how we answer when two or three agree upon anything in my name are we answer he want us to believe that he that is in us is greater than he that is in the world wall eNOS can be pounding your mind and things of this world can be appealing to your flesh but you have to know that he that is in you it's a very God that created a universe the one that said peace be still he can speak to your situation again if you would just believe it let's
