[0:00] [Music]
[1:31] it's very
[1:32] hot to be in the tabernacle this morning
[1:35] but very glorious to be here
[1:37] so glad that we could get in today for
[1:41] this service
[1:43] and uh i've given out that
[1:46] i have a study now on this 70
[1:49] weeks of daniel that ties in the rest of
[1:52] the message before i can go with the
[1:54] the seven seals which is seven seals
[1:57] seven flags seven trump is three walls a
[2:00] woman in the sun casting out the red
[2:03] devil this
[2:04] 144 000 sealed away all happens between
[2:07] this time
[2:08] and i thought i'd have to get this in
[2:11] first
[2:12] now it's hot we don't aim to stay too
[2:15] long
[2:16] just as we can and this is a season
[2:18] usually off
[2:19] season that when people don't have
[2:22] church too often and especially
[2:26] all of them got air-conditioned rooms
[2:28] and so forth where it's comfortable we
[2:30] wish we had that
[2:31] but at this time we don't have many of
[2:35] our forefathers
[2:36] set out in the hot sun when i think of
[2:39] apologizing to the people for not having
[2:42] an air-conditioned room
[2:43] my thoughts always drift back to africa
[2:46] where they laid there in those storms
[2:48] and them women with their hair hanging
[2:50] down in their face
[2:52] lay there both day and night never leave
[2:55] the spot from where they're land
[2:57] don't eat drink or nothing stay right
[3:00] there just to catch a word or two now in
[3:01] there
[3:02] of the lord i can think of mexico when
[3:05] it's so hot
[3:06] but honestly i sat in an air-conditioned
[3:08] room and tried to fan myself it was a
[3:10] hot
[3:11] and see them people come there at nine
[3:13] o'clock in the morning in that big arena
[3:15] and no seats to sit down sick people
[3:19] real sick dying sick cancer
[3:22] tumor sick mothers little dying babies
[3:25] and everything
[3:26] stand right down that barling hot sun
[3:28] not a shade nowhere
[3:30] and just lean against one another from
[3:31] nine o'clock at morning till nine that
[3:33] night
[3:35] just to hear 30 minutes to an
[3:37] interpreter and see the works of the
[3:39] lord
[3:40] set there and wait big old heavy
[3:43] garments only wear them winter in
[3:45] summers all they got
[3:47] and then i think of laying out there in
[3:49] those jungles how they'd bring those
[3:51] sick people in it couldn't even move
[3:52] in an india one they'd pile one down
[3:55] then lay one on top of that and one on
[3:57] top of that one
[3:58] like that with leprosy and diseases
[4:01] where they drag them through and out of
[4:03] the streets and lay them in that hot
[4:05] barley tropical suns and the storms and
[4:09] lightning of flashing and things like
[4:10] that that lay
[4:12] right there in that sun and storm and
[4:14] everything and never
[4:15] move or complain just to try to catch
[4:19] a word of god now and man something for
[4:21] their soul
[4:22] and why should we apologize this morning
[4:24] with a roof over our head
[4:26] fans are going we should be ashamed if
[4:28] we complain about it
[4:30] amen so i remember not long ago in an
[4:33] island one of the islands
[4:34] out in the south seas i was having a
[4:37] service there that night
[4:39] and oh i'd come up a storm oh i never
[4:42] seen such a storm this one flash of
[4:46] lightning after the other
[4:47] uh lighten up the country and how the
[4:50] winds are blowing until the trees was
[4:53] laying right on the ground i said well
[4:54] there
[4:54] i might as well take off my suit because
[4:57] there'll be nobody down there
[4:59] in a few moments the little car backed
[5:01] up the door and someone knocked at the
[5:02] door
[5:03] ready to go and i said to the boy you
[5:06] can speak english i said anybody down
[5:08] there said you can't even get within
[5:10] city blocks of the place
[5:13] on a big ball park and i said do you
[5:16] mean that the people are
[5:17] are out there like that i said all this
[5:19] storm they said
[5:21] they want to hear about god
[5:24] and so uh i went down there and there
[5:27] were
[5:28] ladies young girls teenagers not
[5:30] sniggering life and
[5:32] popping chewing gum talking about their
[5:34] boyfriend
[5:35] every word they just lay on to it
[5:38] never move just sit and listen make an
[5:41] all recall
[5:42] make us an older call and thousands
[5:45] raised with tears streaking out of their
[5:47] eyes like that with their hands up to
[5:48] god wanting mercy for their soul
[5:51] young girls and boys 17 18 years old
[5:56] now it's kind of hard to get the old
[5:57] folks to even listen you see
[5:59] it's it's uh shows that we haven't got
[6:01] nothing to complain about
[6:03] thanks be to god yes sir we'd like to
[6:06] have it all
[6:07] modern like the rest of america but we
[6:09] haven't got it that way so we'll just
[6:11] make out
[6:11] what we got amen now
[6:15] i got a little thing that i noticed that
[6:17] i'd like to do here in the tabernacle
[6:19] again
[6:20] how many's got bibles raise your hand
[6:22] good
[6:23] let's turn to psalms 99
[6:27] before we have prayer
[6:31] we used to do this brother neville years
[6:33] are gone
[6:34] i don't know have you already read a
[6:36] psalm this morning
[6:38] i just like to the congregation to read
[6:41] some the song
[6:42] this morning when i was sitting in my
[6:44] study room
[6:45] meditating on this message and word i
[6:48] thought you know it'd be good again to
[6:49] have
[6:51] i'm all to read a song
[6:54] i like it so well the reason i was just
[6:56] a little late
[6:57] a long distance call i mean cheyenne so
[7:00] that's the reason i was
[7:03] and now while we're turning to this
[7:05] psalm i have some announcements to be
[7:08] made
[7:09] it would just give me that psalms 99
[7:14] from it's all announcements concerning
[7:17] meetings here at the tabernacle and in
[7:20] the campaigns will come from
[7:22] the office at jeffersonville
[7:25] anyone desiring to know of the meetings
[7:28] must file out or give their name and
[7:31] address and lay it
[7:33] on the pulpit at the close of the
[7:35] service
[7:36] tonight a notice will be
[7:40] sent to you in time for
[7:43] you to make arrangements for to attend
[7:46] the meetings
[7:48] that is if anybody in the future
[7:51] wants to know just where we're going to
[7:53] have meetings we have a system set up at
[7:56] the office out there now that
[7:58] you can just lay your name and address
[8:00] here and we'll send you a card
[8:02] ahead of time so that you'll know where
[8:04] the meetings are going on
[8:06] and probably the subjects and what more
[8:08] there is if you could
[8:09] get a chance you see if you don't have
[8:12] some official place it comes from one
[8:13] says this and one says that you
[8:15] you don't get it you see so just let
[8:18] make out your name and address and lay
[8:19] it up here
[8:20] and billy paul will pick it up and we'll
[8:24] give it out now it was asked also
[8:27] if there will be any more brother brain
[8:30] will have any more
[8:31] healing services in the tabernacle with
[8:34] discernments
[8:36] no no the discernments will be given by
[8:41] by our other board we have a brother
[8:44] neville here now who has
[8:45] a gift of prophecy that prophesies
[8:49] over the sick and makes knowing to them
[8:51] the things that they have need of
[8:53] knowing and we have a brother by the
[8:55] name of
[8:55] hick higginbotham one of the was a
[8:58] trustee
[8:59] served faithfully on the border don't
[9:00] see him this morning but
[9:02] he usually has a gift of speaking in
[9:04] tongues and a little lady named
[9:06] argenbride
[9:08] lovely little sister who has a gift of
[9:11] interpretation of tongues
[9:13] and these messages are proving out to be
[9:17] of god because they are actually
[9:20] not not coming out of order they're just
[9:23] set in order and soon as these gifts
[9:27] begin to accumulate we're going to try
[9:29] to
[9:30] to get the to get it set right back into
[9:33] the church way of doing it
[9:35] and i'm to see them pretty soon and uh
[9:38] so that the
[9:39] at the the meetings will be carried on
[9:42] just perfectly
[9:43] in the order of the lord as we can get
[9:45] it perfectly
[9:46] but these dear people so says my
[9:49] neighbor
[9:50] mrs woods who has a microphone
[9:53] hooked up here and a tape back there to
[9:55] take the meetings just
[9:56] purposely to get those messages
[9:59] and write them down and see whether they
[10:01] are right or not that's how she's
[10:04] checking them
[10:05] i know mrs woods to be an honest woman
[10:08] and she's telling me
[10:09] many things that's been said are coming
[10:11] to pass
[10:13] now so we're grateful for that what a
[10:16] relief that is for me at home when i
[10:17] come in home
[10:18] then that discernment on the prophetic
[10:21] side just tears me down
[10:23] and therefore god has sent me some
[10:25] relief for that
[10:26] through a prophecy and speaking in
[10:29] tongues and interpretation which is
[10:31] prophecy
[10:33] which is prophecy to speak in tongues
[10:35] and it's two different people
[10:36] prophesying one speaking
[10:37] the other understanding what one's
[10:39] saying in unknown tongues is exactly
[10:41] prophecy
[10:42] and now we'll be we have that every day
[10:46] every meeting here when we have our
[10:47] prayer lines in the meeting
[10:49] now that someone then would ask did
[10:52] about the gift yes i still haven't
[10:56] but that only way i use it is on private
[11:00] uh interviews which i have and to obtain
[11:03] them
[11:03] i believe the god on the bulletin board
[11:05] back there to get
[11:07] permission and set your time in order by
[11:10] billy paul my boy
[11:11] for here are in the meetings after this
[11:14] out in the fields
[11:15] anywhere you must have a little card
[11:17] that billy paul will give you
[11:19] if there's something in life that you
[11:20] cannot understand and don't know how to
[11:22] get out of it
[11:23] and you're seeking the wisdom of the
[11:25] lord then
[11:26] let see billy paul my son which is the
[11:29] secretary
[11:30] and he will give you a little card and
[11:32] set you a date
[11:33] at a time and then when we're having
[11:36] those interviews then that will be when
[11:38] we're going together
[11:39] just you and i and if it's women coming
[11:42] you'll go with me and my wife
[11:44] and then you we will find out and seek
[11:47] the lord and ask him what
[11:49] must you do now other minor cases and so
[11:52] forth like that is given over to brother
[11:54] neville and brother higginbottom and
[11:56] sister oregon bride and the others who
[11:58] speaks with tongues and interprets
[12:00] which is here in the church therefore
[12:02] we're like the journey
[12:04] i believe with jethro said to moses one
[12:06] day
[12:07] let's take some elders and the spirit of
[12:09] god was taken
[12:10] off of moses and put on 70 of the elders
[12:13] and they prophesied
[12:15] but just the major and hard things come
[12:17] to moses
[12:18] alone now we're not moses neither are
[12:21] these elders
[12:22] but we're still serving the jehovah god
[12:24] with the same pillar of fire
[12:26] leading us to the promised land
[12:27] hallelujah so then
[12:29] yes there will be other uh be meetings
[12:33] and
[12:33] will be the interpretation the
[12:35] discernments will come
[12:36] that will be giving me the chance then
[12:39] to
[12:40] be in prayer and study the days that i
[12:42] know that these interviews will come
[12:44] and be ready for them i remember billy
[12:47] paul branham our field secretary will

[16:25] we would ask the our god to reveal to us
[16:29] these secret things that's been hit all
[16:31] these years
[16:33] as we are approaching one of the most
[16:36] sincere solemn words
[16:41] thou did speak of it when you were here
[16:44] on earth
[16:45] and said he that readeth let him
[16:48] understand

[16:51] so we most graciously come to the
[16:54] lord and seek thy wisdom
[16:58] not knowing just what to say
[17:02] said in order here a few scriptures and
[17:05] solemnly and
[17:06] holy depending upon thee for the answer
[17:11] for no other purpose but that we might
[17:14] know the hour that we're living that we
[17:17] might
[17:18] be prepared for the great things that
[17:20] lies ahead
[17:23] won't you grant it to us lord in the
[17:26] name of him who taught us all that we
[17:29] should pray
[17:30] like this our father who art in heaven
[17:35] hallowed be thy name thy
[17:38] kingdom come thy will be done
[17:41] in earth as it is in heaven
[17:45] give us this day our daily bread
[17:48] and forgive us of our trespasses
[17:52] as we forgive those that trespass
[17:55] against us and lead us not
[17:58] into temptation but deliver us
[18:01] from evil for thine is the kingdom
[18:06] and the power and the glory
[18:09] forever amen
[18:12] be seated
[18:15] [Music]
[18:24] now if any other man wants to remove
[18:28] their coats just
[18:29] feel welcome and those who are
[18:32] standing around the sides of the wall
[18:36] if your feet gets achy why just feel
[18:39] at liberty to move out
[18:43] now i think if the children wants to go
[18:45] to their rooms or have they already been
[18:47] dismissed
[18:48] this morning
[18:50] [Music]
[18:52] the pastor says that the crowd is got
[18:55] the rooms packed up so we cannot
[18:57] have sunday school for the little ones
[19:01] we would be happy if you little fellas
[19:02] now would cooperate with us
[19:05] as this morning we're having starting
[19:08] a great tremendous message
[19:12] that i'm sure that will mean a great
[19:14] deal to your father and mother
[19:17] and your loved ones that sharing even to
[19:20] you little ones
[19:22] so we approach it very reverently if the
[19:25] lord willing
[19:27] this morning uh
[19:30] we're taking the subject of daniel's
[19:33] 70 of weeks and this morning we're
[19:37] speaking
[19:38] on daniel in captivity
[19:42] and gabriel flying in to instruct him
[19:46] about the future while daniel was in
[19:50] prayer
[19:52] the gabriel the angel come in to
[19:54] instruct him
[19:56] tonight i want to speak on the six-fold
[19:59] purpose of his visit
[20:02] six different subjects to be brought in
[20:04] tonight what gabriel come from
[20:07] next sunday the lord willing
[20:10] i want to place the reason and the time
[20:15] of the seven church ages and what time
[20:17] they are
[20:18] and where we we're standing today amen
[20:21] that's on next sunday morning the lord
[20:24] willing
[20:24] amen now
[20:27] the reason for this
[20:31] i brought down some little notes from my
[20:34] last few messages and this morning i
[20:38] want to
[20:39] laugh over because this is on
[20:42] magnetic tape that will go
[20:45] all over the world many nations
[20:49] and always the reason i laugh it back
[20:53] is perhaps someone would hear
[20:56] the tape for their first time and would
[20:59] not be able
[21:00] to understand what i was meaning when i
[21:03] refer
[21:03] back to something else we have been now
[21:06] for months
[21:07] in the study of the book of revelations

[21:38] to see things taking place
[21:42] that will go from the sixth chapter

[22:26] but i
[22:26] did not try to attack him to explain it
[22:30] but this time by the grace of god i have
[22:33] taken up all myself
[22:35] to try to ask grace before god
[22:38] that i might bring it to the people
[22:42] and in here i'm finding things that i do
[22:45] not know
[22:45] one thing about and then i

[23:35] because i do not want it to
[23:38] say i know this and i know that he knows
[23:40] my heart he's listening at me
[23:43] but i wanted that i might enlighten
[23:46] his people therefore i
[23:50] believe that he will give it to me
[23:53] i do not know as yet but i'm trusting
[23:56] him for next sunday because that'll be
[23:58] the tremendous part
[23:59] as next sunday to know and place those
[24:01] seven weeks
[24:03] each one has a different place and when
[24:06] you do you're going to run them all
[24:08] through they don't come out right
[24:10] they don't register upright it can and
[24:13] therefore
[24:14] i i may not be able to have it right but
[24:18] i'm going to trust the lord part
[24:20] and i remember of solomon one time
[24:22] praying
[24:23] and asked in the lord god if
[24:26] he would give him wisdom not for himself
[24:30] no extension of days no longer life not
[24:33] riches but that he might have wisdom to
[24:36] know
[24:36] how to to to judge
[24:40] god's people and god honored that
[24:43] prayer and gave solomon that wisdom
[24:46] because
[24:46] it was for his people and that's why i'm
[24:50] asking god to let me know
[24:52] what these 70 of weeks mean
[24:55] because i know it's the exact calendar
[24:59] for the age we're living in america and
[25:02] therefore i want to know it
[25:04] not for myself i'm not for myself of
[25:08] course i want to know it i don't say it
[25:09] that way not for myself
[25:11] because i do want it for myself i want
[25:13] to know
[25:14] because i want to know where we're
[25:16] living and what time we're living in
[25:18] and then i know that that was given and
[25:21] different ones has figured it out and
[25:23] they've had it
[25:24] way back one thought i was reading had
[25:26] it all ended up in 19 and 19
[25:30] uh of the 70th weeks well that wasn't so
[25:35] after 70 of weeks after 70 weeks it's
[25:38] all finished
[25:40] so we uh we don't we want to know the
[25:43] truth and i'm asking god to give me the
[25:46] truth
[25:47] yes amen now in order to back
[25:50] this up go back
[25:53] i want to rehearse a little bit of the
[25:57] back
[25:58] so therefore some notes that i jotted
[26:00] down
[26:01] that we had in the fifth the fourth and
[26:04] fifth chapter so that the people
[26:07] will understand first before we do this
[26:11] i want to laugh it over so that you'll
[26:14] get from the fourth now remember the
[26:16] third chapter was the lady of seeing
[26:20] church age and the church was taken
[26:23] up at the end of lady osea
[26:27] now i was trying to explain something to
[26:31] my wife about it
[26:33] i had becky my daughter with all the
[26:35] different types of dictionaries and
[26:37] things that we could get
[26:38] they don't give the answer i got the
[26:41] bible dictionary i got the old greek
[26:43] dictionary
[26:44] i i got the uh the webster's and many
[26:47] others the modern dictionaries none of
[26:48] them could get them the end
[26:49] give the words or the answer anyway
[26:53] my wife said how do you expect our
[26:56] people
[26:57] which are poor people and many of them
[27:00] uneducated like we are
[27:02] to understand such as that i said god
[27:04] will give me anything
[27:07] amen no matter how complicated it is god
[27:10] can break it down make it simple
[27:12] amen for we are the
[27:15] opposition of those people who are
[27:17] longing
[27:19] hallelujah praying
[27:22] for that day in that hour and our
[27:26] eyes are set towards heaven and we're
[27:28] watching for
[27:29] his coming hallelujah and i'm just sure
[27:32] that he will show us
[27:34] yes amen now it won't tell us a day or
[27:36] hour
[27:37] because no man know that but it'll
[27:39] certainly tell us the day of the week
[27:41] we're living
[27:42] if we can just get it now
[27:45] in the fourth chapter john was caught up
[27:48] immediately
[27:49] after the church john going up he saw
[27:52] the complete church age
[27:54] there's where i'd like to stop just a
[27:56] second to say that many peoples
[27:58] who are expecting some
[28:01] great tremendous powerful something to
[28:04] happen in the gentile age
[28:07] are certainly wrong
[28:10] the church age and all that will happen
[28:12] during the gentile reign
[28:14] is recorded from revelations 1 to
[28:16] revelations 3
[28:18] inclusive then the church was raptured
[28:21] and taken up
[28:22] and the rest of this until the 19th
[28:25] chapter is what happens to the jewish
[28:29] race
[28:30] after the church has gone up and it is
[28:33] the time
[28:34] of the great tribulation
[28:37] nothing to happen amongst the gentiles
[28:39] only the slaughtering and so forth
[28:42] as we'll get to that and see but the
[28:44] church itself
[28:45] has gone on the 13th on the
[28:48] last verse of the uh third chapter of
[28:52] revelations when the
[28:54] ladies in church age end which was the
[28:56] last and we took
[28:57] each church age each time each thing
[29:00] that happened
[29:01] each star each messenger their
[29:04] nature what they've done and brought it
[29:07] right down through history
[29:09] until the very last one draw right there
[29:11] on the picture on the side of the wall
[29:13] and when we got finished the holy spirit
[29:15] come in and made a
[29:16] circle of the same thing on the wall and
[29:18] revealed it by himself right here to all
[29:20] of us
[29:22] now in doing this i trust at the end of
[29:26] this he'll come with a tremendous
[29:27] something and show us again
[29:30] that we are at the end time
[29:34] how many of you heard kennedy's
[29:37] president kennedy's speech the comments
[29:40] and so forth
[29:42] how many heard this prediction that by
[29:44] january the first is predicted that both
[29:47] the united states and russia will be
[29:49] volcanic ashes that's all we need
[29:54] it's later than we are thinking
[29:58] so if we are so near to even man of this
[30:02] earth are predicting
[30:04] this tremendous thing to happen we
[30:07] better be on the alert
[30:10] everything right up the date all
[30:12] confessions made everything ready
[30:15] because we don't know just what time our
[30:18] lords go to
[30:19] summon us and when he gives us summons
[30:22] come up higher
[30:24] you better be ready and it's going to
[30:28] come in hours that you
[30:29] think not great pentecostal revival is
[30:34] now
[30:34] ceasing we see it everywhere
[30:38] last great move and messages went forth
[30:42] everything's ready now waiting the
[30:45] church is sealed away
[30:47] the wicked are doing more wicked
[30:49] churches are becoming more churchy
[30:52] the saints are coming closer to god
[30:56] the gifts of the spirit begin to
[30:57] multiply in the little groups
[31:00] we're at the end time
[31:03] oh i love that song that we used to sing
[31:07] in the church
[31:09] i'm watching for the coming of that
[31:12] glad millennium day when our blessed
[31:15] lord shall
[31:16] come and catch his waiting right away
[31:20] oh my heart is crying
[31:23] thirsting for that day of sweet release
[31:28] when our savior shall come back to earth
[31:30] again
[31:31] hallelujah waiting for that hour
