we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it to the wonderful name of our Lord and our dear Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles while you're standing we want to invite you to the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter I know it's a very a very familiar reading but while you're turning there this evening we want to say God bless you all we greet you in the name of the Lord and we sure counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you all once again and we appreciate our dear friend Brother Juan for the opportunity the open door to come through and minister to you and he had asked me the other day about our I guess what we'd call our normal dates in November and we were unable to accept those I've got a meeting already scheduled so I told him I was headed to Saskatchewan this weekend so he's actually flying through here so it worked out to come by and be with you tonight and we thank you for the open door and good to see everyone here this evening and brother Ariel God bless you I told him he's gotten married since the last time we was here so we said God bless you all this evening and we want to look here tonight in the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter in the 32nd verse we know Hebrews 11 as the Roll Call Of The Heroes of Faith amen but if you come down here to verse 32 after reading 31 verses you're hearing about certain individuals but when you come to the 32nd verse Paul says what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell if Gideon and of Barack and of Samson of jephthah of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith how did they do this through faith amen subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stop the mouth of lines quench the violence of fire escape the edge of sword out of weakness were made strong wax valid and fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women receive their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel markings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted they were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheepskin and ghost skins be in destitute Afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and Indians and in caves have lines noticed this of caves of the earth rather and these all having obtained a good report notice this through faith received not the promise God having provided some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect now right there the word has just placed you into Heroes of Faith amen that through faith they would receive not the good report through faith if they received not the promise but they without us should not be made perfect now we asked Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight to share a few things it's upon my heart and if I title this sermon tonight I want to speak to you on What Faith Can Do Hey What Faith Can Do I I was listening to the take blind Bartimaeus Brother Band preaching San Juan Puerto Rico in 1959 and he says now Jesus could not have heard his voice speaking of blind Bartimaeus he was a hundred or two hundred yards from him and people were screaming and he wasn't listening to them they was fussing at him but he was thinking of Jerusalem think about that brother Graham said Jesus is walking through the town there's people hollering at him there's people fussing at him but he's not paying them no attention because he was thinking of Jerusalem he said but that blind Beggar's Faith stopped him and he turned what's going on he said bring him here what was taken place the insignificant beggar stopped Jesus on his road to Jerusalem the insignificant Beggars stopped Jesus on his road to Jerusalem he said your faith can do the same thing tonight and remember amen then in other words the faith of Bartimaeus is not dead amen it changed so put it back where it was if you can the faith of Bartimaeus was not dead it's still alive here tonight see your faith can do the same thing tonight he turned around and he began to look and said bring him here he said what was happening God had provided a lamb for blind bartimaeus's eyes and that same lamb is provided tonight for every person here and everywhere he's passing by let your faith stop him think about that that Jesus the son of God the word made flesh the word manifested was in route to Jerusalem but there was an insignificant beggar who was sitting by the highway side he did not have money right he did not have popularity he did not have Fame to the world he was a nobody amen but there was something only inside of him that had enough power to stop Jesus in his tracks and turn around and say bring him here now we know that the Bible says that faith is the substance of things hoped for amen it is the evidence of Things Not Seen amen for by it Elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which to appear the prophet says I'm going to teach a little bit about faith that's what we all need a whole lot of this and if faith is not an Evidence it is only of substance he said Faith itself is a substance and an Evidence of things that the senses of the body will not declare I thought maybe in teaching this it would spur your faith up Amen to get it to a level where God can move into you amen and can bless you so the prophet was not saying we need more education we need more intellectualism we need more religion he's saying what the church needs is more faith that it could actually raise to a level that God could come into the church and he could bless the church and God blesses the church through faith now I don't know about you but I don't believe that we're here amen just Desiring to be church members I don't believe her here just Desiring to say we follow a message or we believe that God is sent a prophet amen but the prophet identified that in the end time in the heart of the Bride that there would be a hunger and he would call it for Apostolic times he said we see this morning he's been trying to get their Church into the place where we can really see amen Apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger for it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it amen we wanted such a flow that it'll be a help to us that it'll flow out to others so in other words he was saying in the last days there is going to to be a bride who is going to be hungry and she's going to be thirsty for Apostolic times amen that she would actually be a channel amen that when God would pour out his spirit amen he could pour His Spirit into her amen which would Quicken a gene seed on the inside of her soul and that were caused out of her amen would flow more Apostolic times now when you start talking about faith you realize amen that people that have faith has experienced people that have faith has experience and the prophet of God says experience brings Faith amen people that have faith have experience and experience brings Faith now you all know the prophet of God teaches us that people will actually save amen that scene is believing he said but it doesn't work because a man can sit and look right straight at anything and they'll not see it because the word see the word English see has so many different meanings she might be a body of water it might mean to understand it might mean to look at oh there's just all kinds of words you can use but when you say sin is believing you are mistaken can you say Amen but when you understand it you believe it when you understand it you believe it Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom in other words understand the kingdom because the kingdom is the holy spirit in you amen thank you brother that's perfect the kingdom of the holy spirit amen is in you so you have to understand what this is in you so in other words you've got to understand what this is that's in you do you realize inside every person here tonight there is something inside every person because you are a habitation you are a Dwelling Place you you are a place that has been created Amen to habitate something you are a place that has been created Amen to hold something so you've got to understand amen what that is in you and the only way you'll understand it is to compare it amen with what it makes you do with what the Bible said it would make you do amen then your problem is solved amen he is that holy spirit amen if you've got doubt in you been down without the word but if you got faith in you Amen to faith in you will actually make you believe the word when everything else is given you reason to doubt the word I'm on Church you're not sitting here that's a bunch of doubters tonight amen you're not sitting here it's a bunch of church members amen but you are here amen as the habitation of God and it's been created under good works under Christ Jesus you are here as the bride amen I'll tell you what a prophet said you are he said you are a little faith woman amen you are a little faith woman you're not a great big Polish amen fancy religion denomination amen but you're a little faith woman amen I'm just going to go ahead and preach if that's okay you are the place amen that the faith of God has returned to in these last days that's right the faith of God is not in a tomb in Jerusalem the faith of God is Not on a throne in a Corporal body in heaven tonight amen but according to the word of the Lord the faith of God is in the Bride of Jesus Christ and Faith must have a resting place now the prophet said anything that's contrary to the word of God Amen faith in God can have no resting place unless it's a promise of God he said there it takes its Eternal stand amen faith is the foundation of all things you know that in the book of Peter amen second Peter that Peter will actually outline what is called the stature of a perfect man the prophet of God comes along and says those are seven virtues that will be manifested after a new birth in the life of the Bride of Jesus Christ and the very first virtue the very foundation of the Pyramid of the stature of a perfect man was not feelings it was not Sensational it was not emotion but the foundation of the pyramid head of the stature of a perfect man was Faith oh my the promise that when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith so you see on my chart here I've got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it so faith is the foundation of virtue it's the foundation of knowledge it's the foundation of temperance it's the foundation of patience it's the foundation of Brotherly kindness amen listen faith is the foundation of the headstone which is Charity which is God himself I'm on Church you're not going to make it out of laodicea it's just an education you're not gonna make it out of tribulation at this world that we're living in with just an idea about God Amen but in the end time amen God will restore the faith of God to the Church of God and would put her back up on the same rock that Moses stood upon put her back up on the same rock that David stood upon I'm on Church you're not built upon feelings you're not built on sensation you're not built on the way things are going you are built upon Faith [Music] you are built upon faith faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and must believe that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him and when you're a skeptic of the Bible amen you're a skeptic of the word being right you might as well stay back until first you believe in he said what is sin sin is unbelief there's only two elements that control the human being that's either doubt or faith are you in me two elements control the human being you are a human being all right can we agree there you're a human you're not an angel you'll never be an angel you never was born to be an angel maybe contrary to what you believe you're not an angel are you hearing me you're a human being so you're either possessed by faith or doubt he said see one of those dominates your life so it just depends on how much Faith you can have is how high you can rise in other words we're not starting at the top and going down but we're starting at the bottom and going up amen are you hearing me the restoration of the Bride tree how did it die it died by them eating it down how did God restore it by them coming back up come on Church the pyramid it didn't start with the Capstone it started with the foundation stone and God would send a prophet to identify that Romans then I've chaptered behold I lay inside a Cornerstone a chief Stone amen a foundation stone he would identify that the foundation stone is The Headstone is the Cornerstone it's the stone that the builders rejected it's the stone that is returned to the church in the last days that we would have a sure Foundation I mean we're not sitting here on shifting Sands of man's ideas we are standing up on Eternal Word of almighty God and heavens and earth can pass away but my words shall never pass away come on there's people sitting right here tonight that can no more fall than God can there's people sitting right here tonight they can no more die than God can die because God through a prophet let's put your feet up on the Rock and it's a rock of Revelation it's a rock it's not the rockage of altar it's a Rock of Ages and it was shoot out of a mountain and it come rolling down into the Gentile kingdoms and crushed them because it's not a man's Stone it's Jesus Christ the son of the Living God we are not here dominated by doubts we are not here dominated by feelings we are here dominated by faith and faith has made it possible to please God I love what Paul says in Hebrews 11 6 without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is that's right he that cometh to God must believe that he is is what is God can I preach a minute must believe that he is is what he is God Amen amen and that he is a rewarder of them that dilatilly seek him now this is just Bible commentary not of authority so take her leave it but in Hebrews 11 Paul says amen 15 times that it's by faith now listen by faith is meant a living active faith it is a faith that knows and follows God it communes and fellowships with God it does not matter what a person does without faith he cannot please God are you hearing me I I I I I preface that statement I made it's Bible commentary you can take it or you can leave it somebody said why you say that because it's a Bible commentator so if you don't want to believe it I don't have to say you got to believe it but if it's something brother say to you all to believe it that's Vindicated word that's commentators is that okay no matter what a person does without faith he cannot please God without faith a person has to plow to this life all alone and handle all the trials Temptation sufferings accidents diseases and death by himself without faith a person stands all alone in this world utterly without God it is impossible for him to please God so God never did intend for his word to be accepted by intellectualism he extended for his word to be accepted by faith neither did he intend for his word he meant to be hidden in the mind but he intended for his word to be hidden in the heart that's why the prophet of God preaches believe from the hearts and not from the head he did not say belief from the head he said believe from the heart now what does Proverbs 23 7 say as he thinketh in his heart so is he David says in Psalms 119 11 Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against these in Romans the 10th chapter Paul says for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made into salvation now you say why are you saying that about intellectualism because I said like this we've had enough intellectual Gatherings we've had enough intellectual sermons we've had enough intellectual conventions the prophet of God shows you that intellectual Gatherings amen have produced intellectual understandings which have produced total failures you get somebody gathered by intellect you get somebody understanding my intellect amen the first trial that comes our way that they can't see their way through it they can't feel their way through it they can't smell their way through it they can't hear their way through it I'm on Church they'll say well there's no way I can get through it amen that's because you accepted the word into an intellectual realm but if you accepted it by faith into the heart you will stand there like a puppet saying and said I can't see my way around it I can't see my way above it I can't see my way under it but God will make a way and I will go through it have you forgot that for God you're servant is still a way maker have you forgot to forgot your servant it's the one that opened the Red Sea he's the one that closed the mouth of the Lions he's the one that broke the wall so Jericho down he is the one I'm in this shop of power in the fiery furnace amen from burning Shadrach Meshach and it Bendigo and that same God has returned in this last day to the message of the hour to the heart of the believer to announce unto her this is not a man's Faith this is not a Church's Faith this is the restoration of the Divine faith of almighty God what are you saying I'm saying we're not about to intellectual chickens we're not a bunch of intellectual chickens we're word born Eagles [Music] Trevor shall send this mountain be thou removed and cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his head is that what it says no it says shall not doubt in his heart amen but Shall Believe those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith right there Jesus has just spoke what Paul is going to preach in Romans 10 that the heart believeth unto righteousness and the mouth confesseth unto salvation alone Church there is a connection between what is in your heart and what comes out of your mouth are you hearing me there's a Divine connection between what is in your heart and what comes out of your mouth my Bible says guard that heart because out of that Hearts will come the issues of life and if you've got a bunch of negativity in your heart your mouth's going to confess a bunch of negativity but if you give a word in your heart then no matter how bad it is how cold it is how dark it is how hard it is if the word is in your heart you will confess the word regardless of the condition you will confess the word regardless of the center situation because your heart has been guarded by the Holy Ghost he's saying I'm saying it's time to stop talking negative right I'm saying it's time to stop talking negative Amen brother Joe foreign poor pitiful me amen I didn't come to tell you poor pitiful you I come to tell you greater is he that is in you it's in the world I come to tell you that before you was a sinner you was a son I come to tell you you're not following a man you're following God I come to tell you that it's God before you and who can be again I come to tell you go with house and follow my left side and a thousand following my right side they shall not come now thee are you hearing me guard that heart because out of that heart it's where the mouse vocabulary is going to come from don't doubt in your heart and he won't doubt in your lips that's preaching right there I thought that's pretty good for a country boy don't doubt in your heart and you won't doubt in your lips I'm on now you can't have it not in your heart oh you may fake it for a while but what's really in your heart is going to come across your lips that's right oh my it's true he said well there could be a place in he said now it seems like upon thinking those things that there could actually be a place and by reading the word of faith that would go beyond the intellectual conceptions Into the Heart for Jesus said if Thou shalt say in thy heart now we get all frustrated in our minds we go out and say oh I've seen that done yet I oh once in a while just hop skip and so forth but it seems like it just can't get moving right it's because we tried to mix the intellectual with the supernatural so we tried to mix the intellectual with the supernatural they have no dealings with each other at all intellectuals will say one thing Supernatural will say another and any man listen that's ever led by the spirit of God does not take any fault of any intellectual but is Led from his heart by the spirit of God he's led by the spirit of God from his heart so in other words the Holy Ghost has taken residency up on the control tower of the heart of that individual he is no longer led by what he sees he is no longer led by what he thinks he's no longer led by the way he feels but he has stepped out of the realm of human leadership under the auspices of divine leadership and he is being led by the son of man come on Church you want to show it to you in the word the prophet of God said he was over in Memphis right you say well I thought you said from the word I am in the word he was over in Memphis and he said I was going to mail some cards and go back to the hotel or to the hotel to go the airport he said see but there was a woman down there are you hearing me there was a one are you are you hearing me there was an insignificant little woman in the ghettos of Memphis Tennessee who had positioned herself upon a promise of God's word she had positioned herself up on the promise of God's word all the way in the Bible she had the faith of the Little Shoot of my woman that said God you gave me this son and you didn't give me this son to let him die but you can send your profit by here and my son can live again come on church that was the same thing that got over in bond Bartimaeus when he said on the highwayside beg him and Jesus stopped oh come on church and right there in a little insignificant mother in the oh God I feel like shout in the ghettos of Memphis the face of the shoot of my woman the face of Bartimaeus had taken residency in the heart of that little insignificant woman and she got a whole entire plane out of the sky come on now that little faith that insignificant woman amen brought an entire airplane a businessman of important people that's right hello in church what are you saying I'm saying What Faith Can Do faith can ground the plane listen it don't matter how important people are around you when they don't know who you are amen you may look like a little insignificant nobody but if they don't have a reality of who you are come on wherever you are you may be in the same room as the President of the United States but I propose to you that you're more powerful than the president of the United States Hallelujah I propose to you that you're more powerful than the controller of an airplane I propose to you that it's the faith of God it's in your heart you can bring a plane out of the sky the moons hurt if the faith of God is in your heart on a Wednesday night in Minnesota the same God that walked by a woman is a whale walked by blind Bartimaeus your faith can pull him in this pillar and he can answer questions he can fix situations he contains the direction of things what are you saying I'm saying God is still God and His word is still true and his power is still here and his anointing is still following his Vindicated word and the age that you're living in we're not here being led by enticing Spirits we're here being led by the Holy Spirit the father God said today so many people are listening to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God Spirits there in the world they're demons and they go out into places and they get amongst me and ministers they get amongst church members they get amongst good people and they cause him to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things oh God this is a mouthful of a quote and they practice things that's contrary to the word of God today ministers other congregations are allowing their people to play cards in the churches now that's not all together Catholics there's a lot of Protestants those had he said what they're trying to do is substitutionary something they try to adopt some new plan they try to adopt some education to take the place of the Holy Ghost you'll never be able to do it nothing should take the place of the faith of God can I say that again nothing should take the place of the faith of God can I say that again nothing should take the place of the faith of the setting let's say that together nothing should take the place of the faith of the Son of God can I say it to you like this nothing will take the place of the faith of the Son of God in the heart of a redeemed Son of God yeah what are you saying I'm saying that the faith of Jesus Christ is not dead it is alive and well are you hearing me Paul says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I don't have time to stop and preach her but I just want to drop something to you Paul said I live in the flesh you know people say to me all the time they said well brother Andrew amen I almost shouted but I was afraid if I shouted I'd be in the flesh amen they say well I almost dance but I'm afraid if I danced I would get in the flesh can you tell me when you're not in the flesh come on somebody can you tell me amen amen I live in this flesh I sleep in this flesh I preach in this flesh I travel in this flesh I fight devils and are you hearing me there is not one time I am not in this flesh but my Bible says that there is a spirit called the Holy Spirit who will subdue and will mortify the Deeds of the flesh but no church some of y'all have been letting your flesh get the best of you for years but it's time to wake up and realize you are a part of the royal Seed of Abraham and you've got a right to bring your flesh subject to the promise of God's word amen yeah what are you saying you got Victory right now right now Church H book over the pride of life over the lust of the eye and over the lust of the flesh right now you are in Divine possession of authority over that flesh some of y'all right now that flesh says you shouldn't be here but you're here anyhow that flesh says Don't Say Amen but sister you're saying amen anyhow that flesh says don't raise your hand but you're raising your hand anyhow that precious don't stand up but you stand up anyhow because you are in charge of that place by the practice of the Holy Ghost we will not be in dominion over our flesh we are right now in Dominion we are right now in dominion over our flesh by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave his self for me program said Remember the infallible word of God as the sun rose up to show the Superstition so have you promised I I will restore all the years that caterpillars destroyed and the palm of worms and so forth how would they be restored again that tree would live again I'm on Church of that tree would live again what tree was he talking about he was talking about a brad tree that was the first chapter that they had eaten down to a stub born and he live again how they would be restored again we pray father you will send down Grace and the resurrection power of Christ that you might restore listen this resurrect us to a living faith in the Living Word of this day we ask it in Jesus name so in other words denominationalism crucified the faith of Jesus Christ but the message of the hour would be the voice of Resurrection that would resurrect the peace of God by the same quickening power that raised Jesus from the dead would call your faith from the grave of denomination come on you all know I'm preaching to you tonight the nomination killed some of y'all's faith it had you so weak you was hooked on psychologists you were following psychiatrists you didn't know if God could heal you you thought you had to put up with Devils but then one day you heard a little Prophet walk out behind a puppy and and say good evening friends and stand there a six foot man five foot whatever and square his shoulders back and say I take every spirit in this building under my control for the glory of almighty God what was that that was not denominational faith that was not hybrid faith that was pure unadulterated genuine perfect faith of almighty God returning to flesh and he said because I live ye live also denomination dismissed that verse because they had no understanding but a prophet with the faith of God said he's speaking to his wife because I live ye live also what a resurrection that was what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was way back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest now and as I say it's to be waived again in the last day come on now that's that's the Leviticus 23 the waving of the thief the word was to be waved again in the last days I don't have the court in front of me but he says it like this that the Dead traditions of denominational listen would fall off of the church that the full word in his full strength in its full power would return to a full Church what are you saying I'm saying the faith that was in the groom has been resurrected in the bride I'm on Church the faith that's in the groom has been resurrected in the bride you say what is Faith Reverend said faith is a revelation of the will of God so by Revelation do you realize you can actually now according to a prophet go read Hebrews 11 from 11 1 to 11 32 and every place you see by faith you can now say bye Revelation is that okay you can now say bye Revelation you say well by what Authority do you say that by the authority of the seventh angel because he said faith is a revelation among church Faith is not putting your name on a church membership faith is not joining a church it's not reciting a Creed it's the revelation of Jesus Christ which is the will of God taking possession in the flesh of humanity and the church he says today the church don't even believe in spirit Revelation they believe in a dogmatic peace into some system but may I remind you what Paul said he said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God how many knows preaches 1963 perfect faith and in that tape he says now Faith we're told in the Bible that Faith cometh by hearing now you cannot be saved without faith that's right and faith is something that you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there but faith I've been in perfect Faith all day and my head's still spinning on that one and faith is something that you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there but Faith so what's he saying there's no other way to understanding outside of Faith that's right now listen when the prophet of God said it works with faith Express he said light my little ego last night he knew when he heard that scream of the mother Eagle there's a lot of difference between that and the cluck of the hen are you hearing me bad Eagle oh god brother Ariel that eagle had never one time heard the scream of an eagle are you hearing me he had been in an eagle but he was born in a barnyard and a chicken and the eagle was gone so all he had ever heard was the clucking of a hen that's right right and the Brother Juan there was no schools he could go to that they could train him on how to know what an eagle sounds like there was no there was no colleges there were no Bible seminaries that could sit him bound and say listen here you're not a chicken you're an eagle and someday somewhere you'll hear a scream and it'll sound like this there was nothing in him except a seed but who he really was come on church are you hearing me he didn't know the difference in a cluck and a scream see but he was an eagle from the egg he was an eagle from the egg are you hearing me Church you was the son of God from the dean of God he was the daughter of God from the gene of God could nobody teach you could nobody train you to understand the sound of the end time but there was a seed on the inside of you glory to God there was a seed only inside of you that when you heard the eagle scream what when you heard the pure sound of the Revelation the will of God and the age that you're living in something in that voice connected with something in your soul [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah there was a connection between the voice and the Soul that's right come on Church oh God I feel like preaching right now in the heart of that eagle in the heart of that eagle was a DNA of an eagle and for the first time when he heard the eagle scream from his heart connected to his lips and he said I'm not a chicken I am an eagle always Sunny are you hearing me do you see why you're sitting here tonight it's because in your soul there was a predestinated seed and in your soul there was a teen but from the voice of the seventh angel there come a quickening power uphold that seed by the spirit of almighty God and you say I'm not a Baptist I'm not a Pentecostal I'm not a Catholic I'm not an atheist I'm a son all right I'm a God of God there was a connection between the heart and the mouth he didn't know what that eagle sounded like oh God but he wasn't made an eagle right then he always was an eagle are you ready for this and a Christian always was a Christian oh my that's the reason the divorce when you're divorced because you were trapped into it see by your first parent Adam and Eve you become a sinner by Nature you didn't want to be you did not want to be but now you heard the gospel right you heard the gospel and Faith cometh by hearing this is what he says Revelation comes by hearing what is Faith it's a revelation of the will of God faith cometh by hearing revelation oh God Revelation coming back right can I preach to you for a second you got more than just the revelation of the seventh seal not more than just a revelation of the godhead or a water baptism or serpent seed he got more than a rebel Heaven Thunders you've got the most powerful Revelation you could give Who You Are come on Church who you are you didn't get an education of who you are and a revelation the seventh seal you've got a revelation of Who You Are by the revelation of the seventh seal are you hearing me this is not education this is not intellectualism this is revelation it's line upon line it's precept upon precept it's word upon word it's Faith cometh by hearing Revelation comes by hearing and he says there's a little something inside of you another man sitting right by you say I don't believe that stuff nonsense I don't believe that nothing to that see it's a revelation of who you are two men read the same book one man walked out and said I'm so mad that man called me a chicken right another man walked out and said that's the best sermon I ever heard he called me an eagle [Music] and understand it because William Branham was not clucking he was screaming are you hearing me he was not him when a lion roars it puts a scream out through the jungle and the other lines recognize the screen hell what are you saying I'm saying that Jesus himself had faith [Music] now the father of God said the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it is written of me that David say in the Psalms the prophets all them that speak of him I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven amen I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I and myself do nothing but it's my faith in God yeah that's right oh God I wish I was a preacher right now are you hearing me are you hearing me it was not himself it was his faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer and a Believer oh God a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you do you realize that we are not the recipients of Abraham's hope oh my we are not the recipient of the hope of the Son of God we are the recipients of Abraham's Faith the Bible said that before him who he believed even God who quickeneth for dead and called him thanks which are not be not as though they were listen Abraham's Faith was more than expectation that's right are you hearing me if you go to Genesis 18 10 he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and share were old they were well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the men or women do you realize that Abraham has just received a visitation of Elohim to the tent door and Elohim says you're going to have a child Elohim says at the time of life I will return to thee and he will bring forth a child do you realize when Abraham got done with his visitation from Elohim brother Ariel he turned around and looked at Sam era and she was old well-stricken in age her womb was dead her milk Rings dried up can I say this can I give you something to think about her body was in a bad shape but Abraham's Faith was in a good condition shape but his face condition because his faith was not a contested trapped faith in humanity his faith was the faith of Jehovah I'm on Church his faith was the faith of Elohim his faith was the faith of el shadia do you see who you are tonight oh you say preacher you say I'm going to have a body change and my gray hair is going to be turned back back again and the dead are going to raise do you not see our condition oh I see your condition but I say this your faith looks better than your body are you hearing me your faith looks better than the graveyard your faith looks better than the situation that you're going through that's right that's right I'm talking about a faith that can transform things from expectation in a manifestation among church when Elohim left Abraham and Sarah store Abraham and Sarah was under expectation it was not until Elohim oh God it was not until Elohim changed their bodies come on now that their expectation went to manifestation you realize what Paul says Romans 8 19 that faith will actually transform our expectation into manifestation somebody say this with me expectation okay now say manifestation I preached one time on the Revival of manifestation it's a powerful fault when you start looking at it that we talk about expectation but what goodness it do if it never becomes manifestation I'm expecting I'm expecting I'm expected come on now your mother's in here carry that baby for nine months how many times do you say I'm expecting I'm expected I'm expecting are you hearing me but after nine months come on now if there's not a birth then there's something wrong with that expectation that's right are you hearing me if there's not a birth then all it's been is expectation but when the water breaks and the blood breaks and the baby comes forth and the voice screams out hormone Church it is now gone from expectation to manifestation come on now you're with me aren't you then the jeans see that was in the father is now transformed through holy wedlock and is now manifested in flesh and a born child of his own heritage oh God don't you see why the devil hates you it's because you are the product of the invisible Union [Applause] of the transformation of sea life through the holy wedlock that Eve failed in the beginning but the second Eve will not fall says the earnest expectation of the creature Waited For What the manifestation of the sons of God now program said see look he said hope looks for something way off but Faith claims it right now can somebody say with me right now hope looks for it in the future Faith claims it right now see faith says God said so and it's mine that settle said I don't care if I'm still crippled if I'm still blind if I'm still sick that don't have nothing to do with it I believe it anyhow it's mine right now God said so that settles it damn it that's right but hope says What God Says so and I'm expecting to get it someday you see I'm expecting someday as long as Satan can put you off to another day that's as good as he wants you'll never get it just believe that you got it right now it's your personal property come on now in order to do that you're going to exercise who you really are in order to exercise who you really are you've got to have a revelation of who you really are faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen remember I said Faith acts now it's positive oh my I tell you sickness and everything else when Faith steps in it's just like a snowball on a hot stove it just melts away everything goes away from Faith cause Faith stands up and takes overrule When Faith speaks everybody else keeps steal that's right so what did Paul say he said the earnest expectation of the creature is waiting for what the manifestation of the sons of God look at this word manifestation it means to be revealed it means a laying bear and making naked a disclosure of Truth instruction concerning things before unknown it is used of events by which things or states or persons hither YouTube withdrawn from view are made visible to all manifestation it is an appearance now how many knows that a prophet said this is an adoption time can I have a few more minutes this is the adoption time for them did not preach four parts on adoption to waste his time is that okay this a message is an adoption message Luther Wesley Pentecost the rep said the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the person himself to come into the body so you're not under a Pentecostal servant anointing you have been restored to a sonship yes that's right man yeah that's right you never were a servant in the eyes of the father you always were a son come on Church you got to get out for that mentality because you failed come on prodigal and you went away from God you know what the prodigal done the product will come home where the mentality about himself he come home with this confession I'll just go home and be a servant I'll just go back home and I'll serve in my father's Kingdom but when the father saw him the father did not say go serve the kingdom the father said Kingdom get the best robe bring forth a good pair of shoes Put a Ring upon his finger come on what was he he never was a servant in the eyes of his father he always was a son hi come on church and under denomination you as a slave under denomination you as a servant but under the revelation of the son of man in the seventh age it opens your eyes that you are not going to be the Sons and Daughters of God you always were the Sons and Daughters of God can I tell you what the prophet says and the Bible adoption part two in the Bible the last days we're living the top of the pyramid we have now come to the top of the pyramid what God is from the bottom to the top faith that's right the cross fish is the cancer age in the Zodiac in the time of the coming of the other line in this cap in a stone but in the days of the manifestation of the sons of God in the Bible see we're at we're at the end time adoption part three this is the day of the manifestation of the sons of God when the Mysteries that has been hid since the foundation of the world is to be made known this is the hour come on church but I'm sending them in the message he said God does not reveal something unless there's Eyes Upon Earth to see it he does not release something unless there's something to receive what he is releasing come on church do you not see who you are do you not see why you're the most powerful force of people on the face of the Earth that these Mysteries that have been hid since before the foundation of the world would be released in the end time at the same time that the Mysteries were being released there was a surprise being released from the fear and scare of who she is to realize she was predestinated from before the foundation can I just cut to the point and say like this you are the place that's the mysteries from the foundation of the world and God have met into a body of Flesh and you're manifest in the thoughts of God you're manifest in the actions of God praise the Lord this is the day of the manifestation of the sons of God part four did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur Gods how many ever know that how many knows Jesus said so did you know law that your law says that you are gods and if they call you them God see which God said to you in Genesis 2 that they were Gods because they had full Dominion domain over the Dominion of the world he give him dominion over all things he lost his he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took it over come on Church you lost your godship you lost your sonship and Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again who will come back and we'll take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top come on Church what is the foundation the foundation is Faith what is the Capstone is Jesus Christ perfect love a moon Church oh God I gotta I got a closure in a second it's coming to me quicker than I can get it out perfect love amen in perfect faith no wonder he said in perfect faith that faith is accompanied by love and love is accompanied by faith are you hearing me what was at the bottom pull fruition at the time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him yes sir it belongs to him you don't know who you are do you you got to recognize who you are you're not about to help us hopeless people in a building tonight you are the Fulfillment of Romans 8 chapter I tell you what some of you all that devil chased you in here and I say shame on you for letting the devil chase you in here and I don't say that to put you down I said to encourage your faith because I pray from this point on it will be that devil chasing you it'll be you chasing that devil young man do you know who you are you're not just a young man living in the country of America you are a manifested full Son of God come on Church you're not on the defense you're on the offense in other words you'll have to keep taking it you can start throwing it back from church are you hearing me amen I just

now you're a mature Sons and Daughters field Sons born songs full science brother ospreach of the day and some come to me I remember when I first really got in the revelation of the word and gone into this anointing how many knows that Christ is the anointing that's right that's right how many knows that you mature under the anointing that's right the prophet of God said now she must lay in the presence of the son which is the anointing and ripen and make all the green that's out of her now listen in your maturity let me let me back up in your immaturity we acted different than we do in our maturity yes yes in our immaturity the devil fools up matters and we got scared didn't come to church for two weeks I'm preaching now and in our immaturity when the preacher said something about Holiness we got mad in our immaturity when the devil threw a child our way or through some matters we backed up and looked at it and said oh no I don't know what what I'll talk to but in your maturity you walk up there and you pick it up and you stole it back at the Devil are you hearing me it's time to take your domain back it's time to take your family back it's time to take your church back it's time to take your health back it's time to take your piece back you are the anointed manifested sons of almighty God the face of God is not in heaven the face of God is in this building tonight now listen their word can I have closing right here he said go right back to Genesis what is it the world and nature has grown and crying everything's a moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God some may say when true Sons yeah born Sons field signs speak songs Glory somebody write that down and give it to me after church born Sons are you ready for this and their word is backed did not

brother my crops you're running up out yonder I haven't had any rain I'll send you rain in the name of the Lord God bless your crop oh waiting growing all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons somebody say Sons sons of God Amen God ordained it at the beginning let me ask you this what was Matthew 21 the REM says it like this he says they were all there under expectation of the coming of the son of God singular praise but Romans 8 says they're under the expectation of the manifested sons Matthew 21 manifested son singular Jesus Romans 8 manifested Sons plural Church age book it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many-membered body amen whereas once thought was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ is the same except in the Corporal body he said now listen Jesus will return again in flesh or Corporal body he's going to come back and confess again he will prove that who is the only wise potentate he is he Jesus Christ Lord Of Glory but I want to tell you what a prophet said he said he was a man in one sense he was God in another sense he was a man in flesh and the spirit was God now notice this the Dove came on the lamb and the Two Become One the lamb was one creature the dove was another creature and when the Dove and the lamb United together God was manifested in the flesh that's right and now yes sir and now he's manifested in your flesh [Music] by being adopted Sons and Daughters to the kingdom of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's right old church you got the power if you got the face to use it amen that's right he's saying I'm saying the authority of God power of God that's right the faith of God has returned in the sons of God and they're no longer invisible they've been made visible by the ripening of the son do you realize what Authority you have tonight you have the authority to fire yes and you have the authority to hire are you hearing me that's right right adopted Sons the father has put into your use the authority of the Kingdom I may have told this here but I'll set real

early church emphasis was not on love the emphasis of the early church because that was the foundation stone their emphasis was the faith of Jesus Christ they wanted to see the same work that was in Christ because you see you will never have the love of God until the Faith of Christ is expressed through you while the church called love to today is just sympathy and feelings you know we we want people to be sorry for us but when the faith of God is expressed through you that's when you will see the love of God praise the Lord amen I mean The Church Must Be the faith of God on two feet not looking for people to feel sorry for you praise the Lord because you are that you are that very expression of the faith of God [Music] you just think about it tonight that the faith that is glory in your body is stronger so you see that's the reason why the devil would make you to pay attention to your symptoms because he knows that your faith is stronger than your symptoms he knows that your faith is stronger than your feelings your faith is stronger than your thoughts and God is not looking at your symptoms he's not looking at your feelings he's looking at your faith [Music] praise the Lord faith is the foundation stone love is the Capstone praise the Lord so if we can get the foundation right it's already Faith coming by hearing hearing of the word of God every time you receive the word and you identify with Thy word you say Amen you embrace the word by saying amen you embrace the word by lifting up your hands receiving that word you embrace the word every time you Embrace that word it's faith that you are pocketing every time you say Amen to the world you are packing flame again praise the Lord and then sometimes you're going away from this Terrace you feel so tired why
