[Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] because God has Law set together and uh these laws like the Sunder age you put a of bird in a good field it'll grow I know your question now he said I have gotten a man from the Lord that's exactly right you could take the honorary woman in the town the worst man if they had a baby you would have to come from the Lord because God has laws set together and these laws like the Sunder age you put a cocklebur in a good field it'll grow and it has to grow because it's God's law when seed is planted it must grow and nothing can grow life but God because it operates under his laws therefore when the evil seed was planted in the womb of of Eve it had to bring forth because it's God's law a production and he could do nothing else but bring it and it had to come from God that's the reason people say little baby sometimes it's not born with Christian parents are lost Jesus Christ's blood got tones for the child I don't care how much it was born how evil it was born he's the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world a little child cannot repeat because it has nothing to repent for and that was the sin of the world which was taken away by the blood of Christ babies go to heaven its original sin and that's the reason it's it's question when any great phenomena comes from God about the first thing what about marriage and divorce now as ever it still is a question amongst the people as it was in the times of Jesus as it was in the times of Moses it's always been and is to this day a question among the people because the people want to know what's the truth but where there is a question there must also be an answer and now being an answer as I have said before this week there must be a correct answer and if we get an answer to anything and it uh it isn't right uh then we know that it was wrong but there's we're still asked to tell the true question is answered if you want to know truth and being this is a Bible question it should be a Bible answer is like I've said if I wanted to go East this morning and the best that I know this I had to find a certain something in the field it was directly east and I went East somebody said brother Branham this is East it is East potentially but it's Northeast I would pass the very object I was looking for I'd come back knowing it was wrong and then if somebody said brother Graham go this way to your right now that is potentially East also but it's Southeast I would lose the object that I was looking for because I went beyond the boundaries of the perfect and direct way now if that be so we have two schools of thought on marriage and divorce and that is one of them says that a man can only be married once unless his wife is dead that's one of the questions but you go to following that you go overboard and then the next says oh if the wife or the husband either one has committed adultery either one of them can be put away and married again you find yourself overboard with that so see it's either south east or Northeast we won't directly east you run out of scripture when you go this way you're out of scripture when you go that way we want to know where scripture meets scripture I know what's the truth of it each takes a different way and failed to bring up the correct answer but there still must be an answer it's just like today there's two great schools of Doctrine in the church one of them is Calvinism the other is our myth armenianism one of them is legalist the other one is Grace and then we come to find out that the people who believe in grace the Calvinists they say bless God it don't hurt me to smoke it don't hurt me to drink I can do these things I've got eternal security then we find the other side on the league that said oh I would like to ball him out I'd like to show him a piece of my mind but I'm a Christian I have to keep still see you find yourself on two different roads and neither one of them is right now that's hard to say that but it is the truth we find ourselves on two different roads one going one way one another now let's see what truth is now listen and see if this sounds sensible to you for instance if I get ready go overseas I'll take my own family I'll call my wife up to me and I will say uh we're go I'm going overseas dear now here is the legalist sign now my wife I'm going to lay the law down to you if you flirt with any man while I'm gone when I come back you're a divorced woman and I don't want you making eyes don't want you flirting you understand that I'm your husband if you do it I'm going to put you away you want to come back then she reaches and gets me by the time and say my good man I want to tell you something that if you make eyes with any woman or take any woman out or flirt with any woman you're going to be a divorced man when you come back I wouldn't that be a happy home that's the legalism all right now the other side is that if I go over seas and uh make a mistake go over and say when I look I'll take this woman out oh it's all right my wife she don't care my wife said I go out this man it's all right Bill he don't care if I don't care then there's nothing wrong with me I don't love that woman right and if she don't care there's something wrong with her she's my wife I don't want other men fooling with her she's my wife now the correct way of it is both of them's God of truth but not the exact truth now I want to go overseas to make it right my little family gathers around him we pray with one another and I commit them to God and they commit me to God and when we do we go over sea I go overseas now I know she loves me I have confidence in her and I love her she's got confidence in me as long as I love her like that she don't have any worry about me taking any other woman out as long as she loves me right while there's no me me thinking about any other man going out with her because she's my wife and I believe her I believe if I would actually do something wrong make a mistake they go out with some woman and return back and would confess it to her and tell her media I didn't mean to do that I just got caught in a trap this woman just run right up to me and and grab you by the arm and started so and so I believe should be understanding I believe she would forgive me for it but I wouldn't do it for nothing because I love her though she would forgive me I wouldn't do it I wouldn't hurt her for nothing though I know she'd forgive me for it I don't want to hurt her and that's the way it is with God if I if a filial love which is human love Fellowship love can make a man feel out about his wife what about a gopal love the Greek word meaning the love of God how will that make me do about Jesus Christ as long as I want to go do it it's in my heart to do it whether I say as long as you say my heart to do it I I go do it legalism won't let me do it it's because I know I get punished for doing it but the real truth of it is is when the love of God comes into your heart to you want to do it that's the truth of it there's the two schools not legalism or other art the Calvinism it's both now we find out today oh so there's many different denominations there's the Catholic Church the Protestant Church each one of them says they're the way see we have the way we're the truth there's a Methodist says we have the truth the Baptist says we have the truth well to me as long as they feel that way it's not so because Jesus said I am the truth therefore is my sermon last night was that he is the place where God put his name the only place to worship you are not a Christian because you're a Protestant you're not a Christian because you're a Catholic you're not a Christian because your Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal you are a Christian because you've been baptized into Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit not by water there's one Faith one Lord one baptism that's Holy Spirit baptism water baptisms inducts you into a fellowship of Holy Spirit baptism inducts you into Christ there's the truth we have also two thoughts of this marriage and divorce now that our Lord has opened the seven seal mystery of his word to us in this last days now many of you this might be Greek to you but my church understands or what will you serve the visions and what taken place I am the question is a Bible question we are invited here to believe there must be a true answer to the whole hidden secret that's been hid since the foundation of the world and the Bible prophesies and says that in this day these secrets would be made known Revelations 10 and at the sounding are the seventh angel the lady of sea messenger the mysteries of God would be made known and this is the last age which is laosia look at all this revival has went on for 15 years or more not one denomination come out of it Luther had a Revival that went into nomination Wesley that one had a denomination Alexander Campbell there went into nomination all these other great John Smith and so forth denominations Moody all along but here's been one usually a Revival only lasts about three years but this is being gone for over 15 years and not one denomination sprung up from it or this is a seed time there's no more shut actually one shuts gone it's seed God is ready if he isn't doing it now he's going to call a church to Perfection by his word Jesus Christ notice there must be an answer somewhere and being at the seven sealed mystery of God Seven Seals how many understands that raise up your hands you see I think most of them is our congregation from rounds listen if not the books will be out pretty soon upon the subject we have books on books on it now Jesus in our text invites us to go back to the beginning for the true spiritual answer now when he was confronted with this there was two things in view the priest said to him can a man put away his wife marry another for any cause and Jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning then they said Moses suffered us a writing of divorcement and to put away for anything they wanted to he said that Moses did that because letting that straight away because of the hardness of your hearts but from or at the beginning it wasn't so the question the question today like a world peace is it coming by politics Union of Nations United I say to you Nate it's always failed at will again but there remains a true answer to the question will there be peace upon the Earth yes When sin is written off of the earth there will be peace but until that time there will be no peace Nation will rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom God gave a remedy for sin listen close now God gave the remedy to rid sin off the Earth but man of the Earth won't accept God's remedy God gave us a remedy and a way to marry our wives and live with them but man won't accept God's remedy right won't accept his word on it Jesus has said this and this reminds us of his words knowing that he said heavens and earth will fail pass away but mine won't the question the true answer that Jesus wants to go back to is to go back to the beginning then that would be in Genesis calls the word Genesis is the seed chapter the every question in the Bible and you always have to go back to the seed to see what kind of a seeds in a field to find out what your crops will be now what kind of seed is sowing Genesis being the seed chapter we go back to Genesis Jesus introduce this to that scripture at the beginning now remember that's when time started to begin before that it was eternity now our question there was notice if we go back to the beginning now don't fail this that's reason I want to talk slow so that the people out on the wires and that the tape will say it clearly if Jesus said go back to the beginning there was only one pair of anything on Earth there was one atom one Eve they were joined by God Alone one female horse one male one female parrot one male at the beginning as he told us to go back there was only one pair of anything is that true then we find out that everything in the beginning was running in perfect order and harmony with God nothing was out of cater everything in heaven is still in order all the stars the galaxies the solar system everything is perfectly in order one of a move would interrupt the whole program now listen do you see one interruption spoils the entire program now when human beings was running in continuity with god with one man and one woman this woman sinned and it showed the whole Earthly program out of continuity with God therefore one word added to this book are one word taken from it throws a Christian out of continuity with God those are church out of continuity with God those of family out of continuity with God every believer can be thrown out by not accepting every word of God then he was the woman that caused the separation of the lovely home it was not a cherubim that bothered the Earth it was not Adam that showed the home out it was not anything else that drove the home out and thrown the whole thing out of cotton Lee but a woman um and it is here that the beginning that Jesus spoke of was broken Jesus said at the beginning God made one male one female of each kind and now when this woman not the female horse not the female dog but the woman she broke the entire continuity of God's operation on the earth and told everything into death the woman not the man she broke the Covenant she broke the Covenant because why she stepped across the borders of God's word now if she broke her Covenant with her husband she broke her Covenant with God then because she broke the Covenant of God she broke it with her husband and when you break your promise and your Covenant to God's word that's what caused so many illegitimate church members cause a group of man got together and said well it didn't mean that and it throws the whole organization out of continuity with the word uh we don't believe that Dr Jones said it wasn't so but as long as God said it so he said let every man's word be a lie and mine be the truth there breaks the continuity now we see being that the continuity is broken then the lifeline was broken also the timeline was broken the Covenant was broken everything shattered what caused it a woman that's what broke the Covenant now if you want to read that you can read it Genesis 3. now it was then man was made to rule over the woman by God's word she was no more co-equal with him she was co-equal in nature you know but when she broke God's word God made a man to be a ruler over her Genesis 3 16. if you want to put it down she was no more equal with the man she was a breaker of God's word don't you see she she the church down here the breaker of God's word that sold her completely out of continuity and that's what the church has done and thrown spiritual death upon the whole thing now you'll understand why Hammer these things like I do truth this is Bible facts notice why does she do such a thing as this how could that lovely beautiful perfect woman I've seen a picture one time I believe it was in Greece of an artist that painted a picture of Eve she's the most hard-looking thing I've ever seen that shows what a carnal mind can look at but she wasn't she was beautiful oh she's perfect woman or woman notice [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
