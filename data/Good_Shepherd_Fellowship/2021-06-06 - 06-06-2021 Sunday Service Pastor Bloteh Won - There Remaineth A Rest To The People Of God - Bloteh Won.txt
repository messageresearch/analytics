when you're sitting there you're like okay you're not a big crowd yeah when you stand you're like oh where did everybody come from you get nervous but you know when god does something to you and somebody does something to you it's good to appreciate sure when you do something to your kids and they just don't appreciate you feel like okay but when a child come back and say thank you that's what i want to say thank you to the lord and uh um hebrews 13 8 jesus christ and yesterday today and forever and the psalms that brothers read it was in my heart and i said hallelujah when he was reading 133 psalms 133 as you read towards the end that's why he commands blessing and life forevermore so it's been a blessing uh two weeks a week i've not been here but i miss you all and i love you all you've been such a blessing a support to even this young man to graduate it takes prayers and support and we just want to say thank you for your prayer and support i wanted to give a testimony over there in washington when we were there last week and it was in the afternoon and they say who has a testimony but it was meant for the young people so one young brother gave a testimony they asked for sisters but nobody came up sister nelly came up and i was like i got a burning testimony but okay maybe god wants me to go back home and give it so i always love love love to be together with sins is something that happens and that's psalms 1 33 and i always want to be off and to be among your brethren while they miss preaching goes forth i said god just give me one thing i can tune it as i go on because life there is tough without christ and i do all i can as human working in the health feels difficult to get every sunday and wednesday off but so far god has been faithful so saturday's sunday and monday was my holiday to work for the memorial weekend and i looked for everybody to work for me it was almost impossible but one gentleman just say hey i had you want somebody to work for you i'll swap with you on saturday and i say oh my goodness thank you i appreciated and prayed for that young man so much so i told my family okay we are going saturday morning i'll join

didn't share i just shared with the lord it's okay i put an excuse absinthe written at work and the rest lord i'm going i don't know and we are more than four hours away from home if i have to be back to work i don't know how i'll do it but god i want to be there so we drove saturday and i'm just quiet thinking like i don't know what i'll do i put myself in big trouble but god is able to pull me out i don't know i just have to trust him i always desire to be here and god i desire to be there you know what is in my heart and i just went acquired they say okay after service saturday evening i'll just go call to work and say i'm not sick i'm not calling in sick because i can't lie i'm not sick i don't know what to do i'm far from work and i was talking to sister kelly and i went to the

[Music] my [Music] day is your name is [Music] the lord bless you you can have your seed it's good to be in the house of the lord and we want to thank the lord for giving us this uh opportunity once again to come to the house of the lord and we very grateful that we we have this place to come together to call upon the name of the lord praise the lord once again we want to say congratulations to simon for our work done and the rest that are coming we pray [Music] praise the lord amen i want to remind us we have in our brother's meeting coming up next saturday there are some changes because of [Music] we taught the dennis who have been able to host us but uh they are very busy by the time that we want to be there which of course it will have created some distraction for us so uh brother jordan and his family are not in town so we will communicate that to him when he gets back what i thought would be good for us to do is that we have this tent up and the grass is just growing under it it's not meant for grass to grow on it it's meant for people to sit down and fellowship so instead of going to dennis we will be at the back of the church here under the tent to talk the things that concern us realize that the i mean the heat wave has been coming our way these uh few days and also the changes in the in the city uh max regulation we want to talk about that what would be good for our assembly so that among other few things we want to talk next saturday and for that reason that's the reason why we we did not announce our convenience service so uh we will look forward to see if we can do that in the coming sundays praise the lord so brothers uh uh next saturday or this coming saturday at 10 a.m if we can be able to make it year and then we will we will reach out to you in a week and but what i was thinking is the other maybe other brothers can put on their apron and face their best breakfast and bring it for us but we will decide on what to do praise the lord amen i don't know where my my cooking skills are but i think i can i can bring you some burn pancakes praise the lord and so that is for next week uh just like i said brother jordan and uh and his wi-fi away brother andrews and uh and his family are also away uh we want to keep them in our prayers we'll continue to remember brother jordan there that the law will bring him through his illness before we turn over to other things we want to do this morning we want to welcome my brother and a friend brother orlando and uh brother orlando uh he has reason by work to uh travel over to uh bemidji for work and [Music] as a christian as a believer he sought to find a place of fellowship and some of the brothers put him in contact with us and and so all through his trip he was keeping in touch with us until he got down to uh his place of work and then he asked that i text him the the church address i text him texting the address it was about 3 hours and 30 minutes almost 4 hours away and but then he told me that he will stay be able to make it to come and and fellowship with us so we had the privilege of having our brother with us so we would just ask him to come and bring greetings from his church and and his family come on brother i greet you all in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ my name is brother orlando my wife's name is gina we go to um christian life tabernacle there in bedford texas so i'm from texas so the reason why you experiencing heat right now is because i'm here [Music] i don't say that as a joke i really believe that because i know who i am in christ jesus um january this january on 16th 2006 um i seen god do the greatest miracle that he's ever performed that i know of uh i've heard about what jesus did i heard about what moses did crossing the sea even what um brother brown did with squirrels and people that he healed but on this date i seen god do the greatest miracle ever ever he's ever done that i know of and that's what he did inside of me i didn't know anything about the message but through that experience you know i was actually on the run from the police and i ended up turning myself in and just so happened that the prison that i went in there was a minister that that was there that was preaching this message [Music] and through that i ended up you know and uh and so um uh i um and and so that's that's the greatest miracle and so and so when i travel and when i go places uh i travel all over because of the work and what's been allotted to me and um and so the psalm that was read 133 it just it was like wow because it was the very thing that was on my heart you know to because he asked me to you know share and um and so because of this this experience that i had with god i can tell within just a few minutes if i'm in the presence of someone that has experienced the same thing that i have whether i talk to you or not i can tell and i guess it's just a gift god blessed me with so there are very few places that i've ever gone to that i'm able to actually take off my armor sometimes even my own very own home i have to keep it on but but i thank god that i can dwell in the place with brother and unity and i felt immediately when i come into his presence to be able to take off my armor and to feel liberty and freedom in this place god bless praise the lord praise him praise the lord amen amen people of god young people that presence is real it's it's real it's an abiding presence it's a it's a ever truth presence that never failed praise the lord no matter where you find yourself if you have ever experienced the holy ghost if you have that enduring presence in you a witness the scriptures say it bear witness that we are the children of god they bear witness to you of who you are and bear witness to you of who others are praise the lord so we thank the lord for that we thank the lord i mean i could i could just tell uh the passion that the brother had i mean he just drove up to uh uh came down from texas he stopped over at uh uh for brazil ave meeting and then stopped in iowa on wednesday night for service and then he drove down to his area of work and then he was ready to get back on the road to come again i mean with all of that traveling it was just enough to take take a week off that's why sometimes people we do just take a week off but you see it's it's not a bad thing if a person even do that but it's something different when the person has a burning burning desire in their heart to to fellowship with god's people and to be in the presence of the lord amen praise the lord and you know this net is not only coming coming in the service to be blessed but coming to be a blessing and i believe that even the testimony of our brother is a blessing amen they have they have helped to to to edify the saints they have helped to bless the atmosphere already so we just thank the lord amen praise the lord uh brother kenneth you have a dead set that you'll be traveling when on the ninth thing of this month okay like i told you brother kendall would be traveling home he was uh preparing to go home to do his wedding marriage and a lot of view but just in the midst of that he his mother went to be with the lord so he had to extend his trip so we would keep our brother in prayer and and also yesterday we had the privilege to uh uh take one of our sister down in the water for baptising uh uh sister patient was baptized yesterday so we thank the lord we thank the lord for that we thank the lord for what he's doing in the house of his people let's stand on our feet and the lonely bring their burdens and their kids this is your house let's just worship him now this is your house this is your house this is your house [Music] this is your house this is your heart we are your house i want to be a holy house [Music] oh we are your house we are your house i'm [Music] i [Music] father i am [Music] heavenly father with our heads and our hearts bad lord god to the dust where you took us from [Music] father one day we might return there or have a body change where we would drop this clay back to the dust and in your presence we were about forever father until that time lord we humble our hearts and our mind to you father lord this morning as we approach your word of god it's written in the book of hebrew that by this very word everything was created everything that noun exists came forth from your word and god i pray that father come out of the pages of your word lord move to our hearts lord god father lord jesus you know where we are lord you

the only one that was walking to take the book and to lose the seals thereof father we are so glad you took the book you lose the seals and you handed the book lord father to the angel in revelation chapter 10. and god we are coming in revelation chapter 10 8 father lord gab to take the book from that angel and to eat the book father lord father god because we have to be one with this book father god the book holds our origin it holds our nature it holds our healing it holds everything that we need help us this morning give us spiritual appetite lord as we feed on your word of god in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord thank you musicians and let's take our bibles praise the lord we started the thought on wednesday night and uh we couldn't get away from it so we would just go right back to ruth chapter 3 praise the lord ruth chapter 3 that would be right after the book of judges or maybe uh the sound uh people will give us the scripture there that's ruth chapter 3 we're reading from verse 1 praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah you know we were talking on a lot of redemption and the law that god has already placed in the universe and it is beautiful when when we look at that let's just read the scripture yeah uh ruth chapter 3 if i'm right from verse 1 they now mean her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that they may be well within and just like we said ruth year is speaking in uh the first person but we know that ruth i mean naomi is speaking in the first person but we know that now mean is not the first person every first person expression in the scripture is god himself amen praise the lord and now it's not boss of our kindred with who's meeting their their wealth behold he wandered ballot tonight in the threshing floor washed ourself that was our principle attraction to this verse washed ourselves therefore and anointed and put thy raymond upon thee the three step to finding rest the three step to finding rest wash thyself anointing and put that raymond upon day and get the down to the floor actually it's full step actually it's full step get it down to the floor there's something some word is is difficult for many to get to anyway but make not that self known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lattereth down that thou shalt make the place where he where he shall that shall mark the place where he shall lie and they shall go in and uncover his faith and laid it down and he will tell thee what thou shall do and she said unto her all that thou serious unto me i will do amen hebrew chapter 4 hebrew chapter 4. hebrew chapter four let's just read verse nine we might come back to to the chapter but let's read verse nine so we can have i will see verse nine dare remember therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is enter into his rest he also has seized from his own works as god did from his let's pray together heavenly father we thank you we we just appreciate you lord the father we can have this opportunity lord this privilege to your open word and dear lord we pray that father the holy spirit will come break the word now to us of god give us give us the thanks lord father that is that is needful for our life things of internal value lord lord gather not just another lecture father lord all jesus oh god but we just want things that will brought us closer to you father lord god because your prophet said lord god father honor this ministry this word will change the items of our body father so we pray oh god that you will help us now lord may we all just get in father this morning lord may there not be one that will be left out to god even the little ones so father may they benefit from the atmosphere lord we thank you and we appreciate you in jesus name amen the lord bless you you may have your seed there remembereth therefore a rest to the people of god that's why we were speaking on wednesday night praise the lord amen they're all the the entire purpose of god for saving you is to bring you to rest amen the entire purpose of this message is to bring you to rest that's why jesus in the early part of his ministry said oh ye the labour and that heavy lady come unto me and i will give you rest we see that in god's principle of creation after he have worked the sixth day the seventh day he came to rest but the principle there is that god will have never rested until he got a man in his image praise the lord amen so you realize that the entire purpose of creation was just not to make a beautiful flower of garden trees and animals the entire purpose of creation was to get a man in his image praise the lord so everything that god has given to us everything that he has created is to facilitate us to get to that place praise the lord are we together now so we realized that when when god achieved that when he was able to get a man in his image even though that man was not in a physical body because we know genesis 1 26 it was a man that was in a it was a spirit man let's say that and but because god has already achieved that now when you talk about spirit man you also realize that it was a spirit man in the mind of god because god has already achieved to have a man in his image praise the lord then the scripture says then he rested amen glory be to god are we together amen praise the lord praise the lord therefore there is a rest unto the people of god amen amen there is a rest there is a place that god will bring a man or bring a woman that's a place where god will even bring an assembly you know what paul talks that about in the book of ephesians where he says we are no longer you know running we are not toast about with every wings of doctrine you know i mean we're not looking for the new messiah or a new teaching to come on the scene you know we're not looking for another one-man ministry i mean there's a place where god will bring an individual there's a place that god will even bring a family amen that's a place where god will bring an assembly praise the lord amen and that place is a place of rest is a place of rest it's a place of rest and we realize that paul dear with that year in the in the hebrew letter and the way he dealt with it is that he brought it right from the joining of israel that god promised his people rest but they were not able to come unto that rest praise the lord and and and and he talks about that uh uh through hebrew year we'll look at that a little bit but we we see here that the the the entire purpose of god of of bringing us to rest is now something that we can achieve in ourselves it's not something that we can achieve in our strength praise the lord but there's a place that god wants a son of god or the daughter of god to get home praise the lord and then he do the rest so that's what we want to see yet a little bit in the life of ruth praise the lord glory be to god what almighty god will self amen what almighty god with self let's travel a little bit and uh and and and see here that when god we will look at creation we will go back to creation a little bit but we will see here the other uh god play out this this uh this thing in the life of uh of the hebrews of the children of israel now you have to realize that brother branham uh make us to understand that god raised up those people uh to to kind of for preserve a bloodline praise the lord and and in them with a lot of the times and the shadow now so god through the uh the promise that he gave to abraham in genesis chapter 15 your seed shall so join into a strange land and our god will bring them up we'll bring them out with a mighty hand and i would take them into a land flooring with milk and honey is that what he said that's what he promised him and uh and then we realized that uh as the years went by it took uh almost about 400 years for israel to get right into that condition for god to bring them out but we knew we realized that abraham isaac and then jacob jacob and his sons and and the bro and and the scripture and brother branham said because of jealousy they saw joseph and that's how joseph got there into egypt and then uh you know he sent for his his father his brothers they're all there into egypt the wheels of prophecy is turning around amen he says humanity for evil but god made it for good god sent me a head to preserve life the wheels of prophecy it is all turning around praise the lord and as the year went back there was a pharaoh that never knew joseph amen never knew the benefit that his gift was to the people of egypt not only the people of egypt brought to the people of the entire existing world because it was the gift of joseph that preserved the existing world at that time seven years of farming if there was not a gift to tell them what to do the people were going to die so it was joseph's gift amen that saved the world so right after that we realized that a pharaoh came in that never knew joseph and and then he started putting the people uh uh uh started taxing the people and you know and and all of that and uh but uh as that went by then and things were happening we know that you know god how to uh allow that to turn the heart of the people away from egypt because they were there in egypt they were in goshen they had good businesses good job complacency was coming in so god had to you know stir the water again to turn their heart over to the promised uh promised land now so what i want for us to watch is that god man is uh sent moses and uh moses bring a message you know uh let my people go and god is now preparing to take them into the promised land a land flowing with milk and honey praise the lord watch a principle here as we will study together exodus 28 verse 1. he actually starts from exodus chapter 3 when god came down in the form of the pillar of fire the burning bush he called moses and he dared with moses in such a way that he lost his ability to speak and moses said he can speak and he was so nervous in the presence of god and god said your brother aaron will be your spoke man amen so they went down to egypt and you know them and moses were coming and killed to iran and iran will and uh will now address uh uh pharaoh and his men but as time went by we see here now when the people uh uh have come out of uh egypt god is not about to establish uh an order let me call it that way he's about to establish another now what is this order for to bring them to rest because they are going to elaine that god has promised their fathers a land that he said flooring with milk and honey now the the phrase milk and honey all have to do with rest amen that's what god meant when he said milk and honey there was no literal place where milk and honey was flooring but like brother branham said in adoption he says you know it was a place that they can call their own a place where they would get tall and and plant their crops and and and sit around with their family talk about the story about the exit and a place they can call their own a place of rest yes they don't have to be looking over their shoulders praise the lord and that's where god wants to bring every one of us a place of rest yes amen a place where there is no habit that is chasing us a place where there is no familiar spirit or nothing of the word we know that we are in a place of rest we don't have to look over our shoulders and say what is this i mean you don't have to make no kind of an interpretation if you have a bad dream because you know you are in the place of rest praise the lord amen a place where you know that you know if the rapture should break you know that you will be stepping on the streets of glory you know you know you are convinced of that praise the lord oh you know there's a new body waiting for you in glory glory be to god if this afflict tabernacle [Music] while the paramedic is coming in and they are talking about this you will step in your new body you'll be looking down there and you know that if anything is keeping you back from that feeling we have to deal with it you know that you know that you know glory be to god amen and you know god god is the one that lay the rules amen he gave john the baptist the holy ghost from his mother womb so he stepped he set a standard before age he gave the holy ghost so there is no age to the holy ghost that's right there is no age to the holy ghost praise the lord he can give it in the womb praise the lord he can give the holy ghost even before you cross this life so there is no there is no excuse amen are we together so this is said and now god is going to set an order he's going to set a principle how he going to bring these people into rest how he's going to help them as as simple as a way appeared you have to realize that uh jacob in blessing his children uh levi was giving a portion and the portion of levi was uh he was appointed the priesthood praise the lord but here is god coming and then he's he's coming now and leading his people into this place of rest he's using his prophet moses exodus chapter 28 let's read verse 1. praise the lord exeter 28 verse 1 the scripture says and take down unto thee aaron thy brother and his sons with him from among the children of ezra that he may minister unto me in the priest's office even iran now god is now telling moses which of course he was the prophet to now call aaron and his sons to this calling that it will be set aside to break be the priests praise the lord amen from this was what started the aaronic priesthood right okay which of course that came out of the leviticus priesthood right amen are we together let's go to chapter 29 you can read the rest of the chapter but we we just want to run over quickly and so we can get into chapter 29 which of course is a continuation of chapter 28. god is saying over here to to moses call your brother aaron and his sons and then after you call them he talks about the effort he talks about the breastplate he talks about everything about that and then when he comes over here to 29 he he he talks about you know taking elan the bullock and two rhymes and all of that but then let's drop down to verse four and aaron and his sons shall thou bring onto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt wash them praise the lord you call aaron and his sons and then you're going to bring them to the door of the tabernacle which is a public gathering amen it's a public gathering you're going to take them behind the curtains and they will strip their clothes and they will get into the basin now so this is moses now that is going to washington amen the prophet now is going to wash these people that are now going to be ministers that are now going to be priests praise the lord whatever idea they have from the levitical priesthood had to be watched amen for the matter of fact aaron was older than moses but yet god has to watch him of his idea as being the older brother [Music] because now he's called to an office and moses had to wash them and as you go down and read the scripture he has to wash them and i shall take the government and pull it upon aaron the court and then when you go down verse 7 then shall thou take an anointing oil and put it upon his head and anoint him now so what god is doing the ministry that the priesthood was the one that was going to help the people to bring them into rest that's the purpose of the ministry it's not just to be a sound barrier it's supposed to bring rest to the people it's not to create confusion in the minds of the people because we're not running race so moses was supposed to watch these people aaron and his sons and annoyed him and then when you go down in the reading he was supposed to dress them and the priests who are tired are we together amen he was supposed to dress them in the priests who were tired now god was he was setting out a spiritual principle because you see the thing that is that it's like brother branham said before anything happened on the earth it first take place in the heavens praise the lord and if and if in our spirit man we can never come to rest with god you can nev you can live in the most biggest home with uh with with sevens all over you and i mean and and and i mean you just it's a lazier island they can put you alone on that island if you don't have peace of god in your heart in your mind you are never going to be at peace with whatever you have you can have all the money in the world you can have i mean everything you want if that piece of god is not achieved in your act and in your mind there is nothing in this world that will satisfy you so you see god was establishing an order of inner peace for them before they can get to the land for them to have earthly peace praise the lord amen oh there is a rest unto the people of god glory be to god amen so moses how to bring aaron and his sons into this order he has to wash them this was a complete different divine order now under the levitical priesthood you were you were called to that priesthood by birth when you were born in the tribe of the levites but this priesthood is different it has to be the prophet moses taking instruction from god not calling the entire trap of the levites but now calling a household praise the lord oh glory be to god amen let's just take our time here we're just trying to lay some foundation praise the lord amen you see that's the reason why we just have a bunch of confusion all over christendom praise the lord all over christendom i mean people think the scriptures they're they're they're they put their their rap lyrics into it and they can run with it and amuse people and makes people to shaver and and no the ministry is supposed to bring you to rest and there is an order of rest we are one rest yeah but sometimes not many people want to be watched the watching part is the difficult part praise the lord you imagine moses is telling aaron buddy strip yourself i'm going to bear for you buddy i i beat you when you were just a little boy yeah amen [Laughter] but you see that's god's father that's god's order and that is the very same step that naomi told ruth to bring her to rest praise the lord the very same step come on you have to watch yourself you have to be anointed yes sir you have to change your women and you have to fall at his faith praise the lord glory be to god amen i know many times when we i mean we take bath and where our best is hard for us to get on the ground and knee down and worship the lord [Laughter] praise the lord but man how are we going to come to rest people amen so you see god was setting out a spiritual order now that was why paul referred to in the book of hebrew and said the people did not mix the promise with faith why because they did not recognize the spiritual order that god set for them amen and because they did not recognize it that was the reason why and and uh koran and dayton rebelled against moses they were rebelling against that spiritual order yeah someone says you take too much about yourself it's you and your brother aaron and and and and that's what they were fighting against you see because they never honored they never accepted they never received the spiritual other that was going to bring them to rest in the presence of god it was difficult even though the land was given to them they crossed the red sea the cross jordan joshua distributed the land to them amen but yet in their own giving inheritance they became slaves to the inhabitants they could never overcome because it's not by power it's not a might it's not a power it's not he that willeth it's not he that run that it's not he that knows everything but god has a structural principle and if you bypass god's principle there is no way god will bring you to rest paul amen they did not miss it with faith why because they missed the spiritual aspect why was god setting up this order for the tabernacle the scripture says the worshipper once parched he must go bad away from that confession with no sense of guilt that was rest when the worshiper once patched he must be able to turn around because he had found rest praise the lord amen but even though they were making sacrifice after sacrifice after sacrifice they could never come to rest they were growing right away from the house of god still going with their guilt so it was more like just performing their deal tech come to church perform their duty clap their hands pay their tithes and offerings and they know they have done their religion and it goes back but stay going back honor the burden of sin the burden of guilt that still haunts their mind that still haunts their spirit praise the lord and you see it all starts there from uh from kiddish you will realize that that uh uh paul spoke about that in the book of hebrew there in chapter two and three where he he points the people to the place of where uh uh uh numbers chapter 13 when the spires went to to to spa the land praise the lord amen that's where paul was dealing with that's where they never missed the promise with faith because the eyes were looking at the natural things that were happening amen they were looking at the giants that were in the lane when they were supposed to be believing the promise of god [Music] amen amen a thing that was supposed to uh be a 10 11 days joining for them became a wandering yeah it became a wandering became a wondering you see the devil got on the trail we know there by the opening of the seals and uh uh with this whole you know uh uh roman beats from daniel vision that took over the church and and we know the thing that that was brought to the church of making pennies you know how the catholic ch church taught that i mean for you to for you to show god you love him you got to suffer i mean you got to suffer you i mean suffering has to be seen on your skin you know you have to suffer and and in that way they took the wealth of the people all went back to the roman church amen when most of the time they will go after a unique family and wealthy family and they will ask for the young man to come into the prison because everything of the family belongs to him so what they would do there that now you know you're serving god you are seven you you have to forsake this word you don't have nothing in this word your inheritance is in heaven so they strip out of the wealth it goes back to the church so the church taught pennies and as and as the ages when that that doctrine that first was a seed it was a thought the days of the nicolaitan that became the doctrine of bilaam now got into the legalistic group amen so the legalistic group honored that same spirit praise the lord talks about i mean we can preach and and talks about uh you know fornication we can talk about our daughter we can talk about you know we can just rebuke sin yeah he says oh the place is hot but never bring the people to rest so that legalistic spirit gets on the trail and just whip the people and whip the people and with the people and just leave them dry [Music] confused in your mind praise the lord [Music] and then this person is struggling oh god i love you i want to serve you to try to do everything and and and uh uh you know to try to to serve god and and i mean one week it looks like they're on fire they are moving up and and and and then they stumble and made a mistake and guilt starts to hunt them they are so troubled feeling guilty oh i've done wrong because the preacher said i will lose my salvation oh my goodness i've done wrong then it has to go to go and confess that sin to the pastor pastor you know i i i don't know how it happened you know last week i was really on fire for god but you know i made him mistaken and uh i was just with some of my friends you know uh they were drinking i did not drink but i just felt guilty that i was there yeah the pastor said well then you have to stand before the church and let everybody know you did wrong then you got to go and sit on the center bench it's that same old devil just enslaving the people of god they are just laboring in himself trying to bring some kind of a sacrifice to god and never know what is right praise the lord but there is a rest unto the people of god praise the lord there is a rest unto the people of god it's now when we get to heaven even year on earth god can give us rest praise the lord god can give us rest by bringing us to a full understanding of his work of grace amen praise the lord amen oh i like the way james uh john said it if your heart condemned you yeah there is one greater than your heart praise the lord you don't have to go do penis you have to know there is one that is greater than your heart and he's your advocate you can go to him and he will plead your cause amen are we together where am i with all of this thing let's travel a little bit now so you see this thing went on and on and uh but it is it is all because because the people they've met they did not recognize the spiritual order that god was bringing amen there was a principle why there's a purpose why the tabernacle was built and they did not recognize that so we realized here they didn't miss the world with fate like like uh paul said in hebrew and because of that they could not possess their inheritance praise the lord they could not possess their inheritance they came in and out of their inheritance from one revival to another revival they couldn't possess their inheritance they came in and out of it yeah they enjoy his presence and then go around oh my goodness you know they came in and out that's good praise the lord but bam says that's the reason why paul wrote the letter to the ephesians he says the purpose of of of of adoption was to settle the sin problem amen there is nothing that you save today and you lost you get your holy ghost today and you lost it tomorrow it was to bring the people to a place of rest praise the lord that no matter what happens around our life god is still in control praise the lord amen and even if he takes us through different trials in our walk with him it is just to build character in our life it's nothing that you you are going to hell or you you have done something wrong or maybe it's a sin that you have committed when you were a little child that's the reason why god is punishing you no amen he's not an evil hunter whenever he takes his children through triers is to build character the purpose of trying is to build character is to make you a better person and if you know that god is building character it just gives you rest yeah yeah that's right nba gives you rest you don't have to cry oh god i'm sorry i said that 10 years ago oh fine forgive me i don't even know which which thing now which one which one again i have to go back in your mind you have to think you have to think 10 years ago you have to think but if you know that god is building character you say lord you are the potter i am the clan do unto me i say please because i know when you are done i'm going to come out better oh praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah you know that's the re that's what brother branham said that was the difference between uh uh uh moses rod and and jameson jambo's raw come on amen he said they could throw their rod down but they couldn't pick it up praise the lord they put throw their rod down but they did not know how to bring it back the lord and since they didn't know how to bring it back moses raw would just swallow the arrow because he knows how to bring it back amen praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah now so let's go let's travel with this thought i was just trying to uh you know kind of establish us that it's a principle it's a principle that god used to bring us into rest amen you can look at it through the three stages of grace justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost but you see he he places there in types and shadow you look at one of the most beautiful redemption stories in the bible about this roman rule that came from an abominable past her past was an abominable past she came from the descendant of lord sleeping with his daughters which of course it was a curse pass god condemned under the law he cursed it right but yet in all of that mess there was a predestinated sea lion praise the lord amen you know what god is doing when he brings that to your mind you don't have to look for nothing in your past you just have to recognize what god is doing today what he's doing in your life today [Applause] praise the lord anabolic never pass being a morbid glory to god and we know the story but yeri said naomi had the desire now to return back there was farming in the land and she left and she's coming right back the time she choose to come back was in the time of ballad harvest in ballet harvest there were different harvest times in israel there was a ballet harvest and there was wheat habits all right praise the lord and what separated barley harvest from wheat harvest was 50 days now balad harvest was the harvest of the passover amen praise the lord amen amen ballet harvest was the harvest of the passover that's the time of the passover and then 50 days from that time was wheat harvest which is a type of pentecost okay amen because uh uh the passover was when the lamb was killed praise the lord so 50 days from there was the pentecost praise the lord now so she came right in that season you can see the hand of god all through scriptures praise the lord all true scriptures you can just see the hand of god the timing is right that's right the timing is right because it was right between that that season where the dispensation was changed from the jewish church to the gentile church it was right in that period of time between calvary and pentecost are we together this is a time where naomi decided to return back home glory be to god let's go to ruth chapter one amen let's go to ruth chapter one oh praise the lord amen glory be to god hallelujah are we together now in rue chapter one instead of reading the entire chapter i'm trying to grab a place here and uh and we see here the scripture says uh our past have have turned her back and she's gone back in verse 15 and she said behold that sister-in-law has gone back onto her people and uh returned there that self and and ruth said in treatment that to leave thee or return from following day uh uh fall down i would go where they are going that people would be my people praise the lord and and your god will be my god she says out of that praise the lord amen there is there's a place that caught my attention uh when i was reading this chapter that i want to bring you to uh um praise the lord amen now so you see here uh when she saw that uh she was steadfast in her mind speaking that's verse 18 verse 19 and uh kind of kind of forgetting uh a reflex from what i was reading but there was somewhere there here in the verse where ru naomi originally on a prophecy she she spoke about rest you know verse nine as you call it my eyes just went to it and now me verse 8 said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each to your mother's house the lord they count it would be ye have there with the dead uh as you have dealt with the dead and with me the law grant you that ye may find rest praise the lord amen the lord grants you hallelujah may find rest she prophesied yeah that's right amen you have liver with me you've been patient with me you stood with me now may god bless you amen may god bless you that you will find rest amen now go on to your mother's house go on and continue with your life praise the lord but you see there was something about ruth that we can tie to predestination and we can tie to revelation amen praise the lord because yeri said that she's being married into this home of a jewish family that they're they're pretty soon they started learning the laws and they started learning you know everything the blessing of abraham and all of that and there was something that being around this home she realized that there was a peace of mind there was there was something that was comforting amen that was different than the family she was born in and the community that she rose in and her own national people she realized there was something yeah and and and yaris said that naomi is promising her rest in her mind she's thinking where am i going to find rest where am i going to find rest right for the matter of fact everybody might i have spoke evil against me it's good you broke the law you're supposed to get married to the people of your village you left them and you're going married to some kind of a foreigner now they are dead where am i going to fire rest do i have to go back to the priests or more up and go and confess my sin and and make us uh uh seven sacrifice because i have done wrong praise the lord she was wanting rest amen praise the lord so now i'm in here prophesied on our inspiration glory be to god and now we know the most famous saying your god will be my god your people will be my people praise the lord amen i've said this over the years uh you know many other places i since uh you know uh most of the time uh young people take there to you know to their wedding invitation you know they put that scripture there your god will be my god but actually when you look at this this was a daughter daughter-in-law and mother-in-law conversation praise the lord it was a daughter-in-law and mother-in-law composition well let me just go over there and go to my message because i may start another bucky amen now so yara said there brother branham talks about ruth laboring she first had to make a decision when she made that confession your god will be my god your people would be my people where you go i would go that was rule confession that was her decision and then brother branham says after that she has to labor oh she took her name when she came back and you know and and everybody call her the morbid if you read the scripture you read the book of ruth you realize here uh you know in chapter 2 and over he notices ruth the moabite and suddenly change when you come to chapter three it's suddenly changed i'll point that out to you but here she comes back and she gets right into half a season she's cleaning and i mean she's gleaning because she knows she comes back with naomi there there is there is nothing that now me can hold on to us and inheritance you know she's squatting in maybe one of the family house and and here said that i mean she never only came back without her husband and sons but she can't knock her for more about girl but ruth have to pass luck out of that amen she has to go in the field she has to overcome complex praise the lord one of the greatest demons that we deal with she has to overcome complex she has to know that she made this choice the offer was given to her to go back but she made this choice and because it was her choice she has to listen to the god of her conviction into what people were saying around her no matter what they think about her what they say about her she knew there was something dealing with her heart praise the lord she couldn't understand it she didn't know about the seal she don't know nothing about the messenger abraham isaac and jacob she don't know nothing about that all she knows that there was just something something special that was dealing with her [Music] name praise the lord amen and she comes and and i mean uh she's not she's not uh uh uh sitting there and waiting to be safe she's jumped right into the field and she's gleaning and i mean she's going from field to field uh and and she's gleaning i mean when she gets to a setting place all of those uh hebrew girls that just drove one place like this and look at her she just bought her hairs and she's gleaning i mean she's in the system element body you know what it is when you get rejection and and all of that is going through her but she's just holding herself within and she's just holding herself within it and she she labor she labor right praise the lord she labor right and pretty soon it started becoming noticeable that even the lord of the harvest boss started noticing her that he gave her a special privilege come and glean him i feel amen glory be to god you know brother branham talk about that uh that chicago ranger i went down and was looking for the wife praise the lord he was looking for a wife he was looking for a housekeeper he was not looking for a party girl he was looking for one that would keep the house so he never went to the party looking for the wife while the party was going on he went to look for one that is at home that is keeping the home that is doing something right praise the lord and by divine favor there is a connection that was coming to borah's heart about this young woman but you see she was in a widow cloth she was in a witter club because she was a widow she lost her husband praise the lord and now on an until the woman put off her weather cloth calling to the lord of israel a man could not approach her so boss even if he loved her praise the lord paul taught us that in romans chapter 7 even if he loved her it was just a feeling in his heart because she still identified with the love of her first husband by her widow club and second there was another man that was close in the lineage of the kingsman hallelujah so boris how are all of these obstacles before praise the lord oh my that redemption story is so wonderful oh what a wonderful jesus we serve amen praise the lord now after ruth has labored chapter 3 as we read now me speak here in the first person seek rest for them shall i not seek rest for thee that just sound to me like the holy spirit echoing in my ears i've seen your labor of love i've seen your sacrifice i've seen your faithfulness praise the lord shall i not find rest for thee shall i not bring you to the place where you can rest where you can start enjoying this message praise the lord shall i not bring you to the place where you can start enjoying the holy ghost where serving god will not just become a rude do or dance it would just be something that would be the love of your life praise the lord you don't have to beat your head to pray oh god i forgot i didn't pray today no you just become a love effect praise the lord you can be right at the back of your staring and tears is coming from your eyes and everybody look and they look around oh my goodness that guy is in trouble he's crying at the back of his wheels oh my goodness god you have that man i don't know what is happening but you are just so torn with heaven [Music] praise the lord entering his presence does not become something where you gotta break the door down and be the bench and be the bench you can just turn around and say lord [Applause] shall i not jesus restfully that's what the holy spirit is saying shall i not find restful day i can take you one step better god is saying i can take you one step better oh sweet jesus what a wonderful father oh glory be to god amen hallelujah uh my i remember one day coming from the chopper i just i just came down from praying and uh and then i came back to my office and and uh you know one of the girls said to me are you okay i said this is the best date of my life amen they could tell that or i mean something is going wrong with this guiding me all my eyes read but i was just having a good time with the lord jesus amen oh my praise the lord and i've never even get to brother branham here yet but i think we're just in line amen trying to find rest for thee and now yeris says she's going to order her how to find rest shall i not find rest for them now she's going to all of her she's going to teach her how to find rest praise the lord we read the scripture watch thyself anointing put that raymond upon day which of course is signified you have to now change from your widow cloth and you got to get some of those best dresses out because you're going to the feast tonight brother branham said kingsman redeemer he says and then ruth was asked to do something that was disgraceful but she was willing because she had made a decision what a type of the believer now i mean the old church said go down tonight it's balanced season oh what a beautiful thought we could hang on right there now i mean the roof come in just as balanced season balanced season was bread season the season when fresh bread was being saved and the church in this last day through two thousand years of pagan teaching and things has come in at balanced season the freshness of life praise the lord you know i the last time i was talking umbrella rehab scarlet tread and i was saying the tear day you know is is a time of life i mean it's just beautiful when i see the holy spirit doing it yesterday i was listening to brother branham in a message that i was listening to and uh uh was what is that uh hebrew yeah i was listening to hebrew chapter 4 because i was telling hebrew chapter 4. and brother branham says he says he said do you notice that the number three is the number of life he said it was on the teve the life came to the earth praise the lord oh my you know that just it can just break you apart because you know that the holy spirit is dealing with you now so you see here she sent her to the place washed herself anointed put that remain upon them and get thee down to the floor so we see all of these stages here and we know that's what paul says in the book of ephesians when he talks about the man ephesians chapter 5 let's take that quickly i see myself running out of time here it's just about time that i should close ephesians chapter five and uh uh that is uh i mean we are familiar with that and paul talking praise the lord are we together amen ephesians chapter 5 verse 26 okay i'm over a year he says hussman love your wife even as christ loved the church that verse 25 and gave himself foray that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the watching of the water by the word praise the lord amen now you will see how this the process comes from an old testament time but yet is is caught up it was plain in the scripture praise the lord now let me let me show you one place there uh uh uh oh my goodness i mean we we we look at the uh second samuel chapter two on wednesday night or second samuel chapter 12 where the david when he came after the little child died you know david washed himself he annoyed himself he changed his appearance and the bible said he went right into the tabernacle and worshiped why because he has found rest yes praise the lord he knew that it pleased the law to take the child and not only that but david also knew that he was forgiven that's the reason why he could wake up change his clothes anoint himself and everybody asking what's wrong at the time the child was sick you were fasting and praying now the child died it just looks like no no no all that time he was spending before god he was pouring his heart out to god he was looking for rest praise the lord he was looking for rest the lord if you spare the life of this child may i find rest not to look at him and feel guilty all the time praise the lord because sometimes people connect children to to their thoughts and when things start happening in your life then look at that child okay that this child was born at the time this thing happened to me so david was at a place where he wanted rest in his heart no matter law what whatever is the decision whatever happens here if you spare the life of this child let me be able to live with him and be happy amen if you also take him away let me also be able to live and be happy that is when god and man pour his heart before god and say come into my heart lord whatever is the result let me get it from my knees and be happy praise the lord because you see that's that's the way the devil works he always strives to look for something where he can tie your memory talk he can be able to bring you back tone and he will use that to draw you back into condemnation to be able to draw you back into shame yeah praise the lord that's why the holy ghost is important that's why experiencing forgiveness not just as a word but for giving us us the freedom from guilt amen praise the lord when a man is free from guilt he don't struggle to talk about his past because he does not hurt him it does not hurt him there is nothing there hurting his repetition is not tied to thy past oh glory be to god hallelujah amen praise the lord let's close this up here so you see paul brings this in he puts the husband to the place now watching the church by the water of the world now you will see in the scripture how beautiful it plays out here in the ministry of jesus praise the lord because we see in in in the new testament church we realize that there are there are two places in the scripture the bible talks there in luke chapter seven where the bible talks about a woman praise the lord in simon house and brother branham said this woman was not living a good life but here it said yeah she realized that jesus was brought to simon house and then no sense of welcome they never wash his feet they never anoint him praise the lord amen see the paradox here ruth told her daughter in lord wash that self and annoy that self but in this story this woman is watching jesus feet and she's anointing jesus little did she know that she was doing it to herself little did she know that watching his feet weapon with her head and taking that expensive other batch of oil to anoint him neither did she know right that she was doing it to herself because he's a woman your clothes is changed your clothes has changed woman that are forgiving yes sir you see why paul in the scripture says do your service as unto the lord and don't look for man's don't be an eye pleaser whatever you would do let it be like unto the [Applause] glory lord god amen praise the lord she got there and she broke down in one message brother branham says god brought the fountain of her tears glands for her to have enough tears to wash his feet he broke the fountain of her tears glance and she cried and she cried yeah have you ever experienced that i can say to you the night i received the holy ghost that's what happened to me i didn't know what happened i cried i cried i cried everything i think about i cried i think about my mother i cried i think about my life i cried it was many years ago one old preacher told me and he said son that was a sign of the holy ghost i cried the whole night until morning and i was walking in the place and the boss asked me i i needed i was sleeping at work and he asked me he says what's happened he thought that maybe i heard a news that i've lost one of my parents or something he said i heard somebody sobbing all through the night i said well i'm sorry i was the one i couldn't tell what was happening but i just cried i cried i never cried for the law firm like that but god broke yeah her tears glanced and she could cry enough tears to wash his feet praise the lord and she was doing that unto the lord but since everybody knew her repetition even simon said on the stool if he was really the man of god he would know that woman is a sinner because we know her we know her life she was doing it unto the lord but little did she know jesus is woman thy sin is forgiving thee it's it's it's it's a it's a it's an immediate action it's a word of the master that separates you from your past amen praise the lord it's a word from almighty god that cut the umbilical cord of sin from your life that's what the holy ghost does that's what the power of god does it cut that call of the same nature praise the lord all the things you struggle with they are just memory yeah but the desire is gone the devil gave you flashback he gave you flashback but the desire is gone oh i challenge you to try to go back you will just look stupid praise the lord you will just look stupid put a cigarette in your hands you don't know what to do with it you will use it and start writing insane before you used to keep it at the corner of your mouth but you would just take it and start writing this so you see it is the husband that watch every time we praise him after the preaching of the world every time we lift our hands we are watching his feet and he in return he's anointing us praise the lord oh i love the lord jesus i love the lord jesus glory be to god amen and it's through the scripture it was a principle of redemption that's why the preaching of the word that's the reason why this man had to be watched why because there was one principal watch that was done in the scripture one principle watch now when the worshipers come to the tabernacle all they had to do was just to go to the lava and wash the dust off their feet but there is one principal watch that the holy ghost does he gave you a good sub bath watch in the bathtub he touched you from your head to the sword of your feet and then after that watch all you need is just a watch out the lava [Laughter] praise the lord oh my glory be to god but when a person has not experienced the entire body watch nature change desire change amen if you experience that come on very branham said you will not wait until the door open you want to be to the house of god because you have already experienced an entire body watch so whenever everything is seek on your feet you want to be in the presence of god and wash it out quickly because you already have your entire body watched that's why jesus told peter he that his fetus watch not his whole body because you have already got a body watch he says you are cleansed by the words that i have spoken to you amen that's the reason why the the the believers run to the house of god amen they can't stay away from fellowship because they have got an entire body watch yes as we go along we rub arms with the word by the things we hear people saying the things that are all on the street and then quickly we run into his presence amen praise the lord amen right in leviticus that's what it was they had to wash their hands wash their feet porter put a a a part of the blood sacrifice on the ear for what they were here on their big tongue for what they will handle and on their big toes for all the places they will go and the scripture says we are priests and kings amen onto our god so when we come to the lord he gave us that top watch i don't know how yours was my goodness but when he got to my back he really scrubbed it [Laughter] because all the good things you try to do your hands can get to your back you can put the face you can do all of that but when he gets to your back he knows that's where all the dirt is settled so he's give you a good bath wash [Laughter] oh my goodness but that's the way that god brings his people to rest he brings you to rest that way come why me rain or sunshine snow or heat there is just something that a child of god always want to be in the presence of the lord musicians you can come praise the lord the lord help us
