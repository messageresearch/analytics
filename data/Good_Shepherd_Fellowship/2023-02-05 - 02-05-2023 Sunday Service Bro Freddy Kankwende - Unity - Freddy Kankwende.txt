extend our sympathy for the loss of our sister Ali's sister we have been praying for hurting they pleased the Lord to take her home amen so we pray that God will just bless the family the Lord have a special way that he bless us when we come to these Junctions in our lives so we pray that God will bless the family and the family back home and the family in different parts of the earth praise the Lord solicits will be traveling home so we pray that the Lord will grant her a safe travel praise the Lord and and bless the entire funeral and everything that would be taking place back home but she uh asked that we leave her mom in prayer and that the law will strengthen her praise the Lord amen and this morning we have uh the parents of sister Rachel Sister Anne Murray brother Johnny turn and Sister Mary look we have their parents with us and the idea will be preaching for us this morning so we have the gifts in the church and so and he's is it's a beautiful thing to have them with us visiting with their children and taking the time to to fellowship with us but Freddie will be traveling you have to go down to the Phoenix area and then to Denver and then when he get back he will just be ready to go home so we talked to see you this time and and have a minister with for us so he would be bringing the word but what is more special to them about today is the 28th wedding anniversary 28th wedding anniversary so uh he will be preaching his anniversary message to us so if you're telling us how to go together don't you wish that he could go in that channel Yes precious life story life story is a message praise the Lord but you know uh uh in the way that we we have built sometimes there are things that that that make significance to you and and uh you know and then it just it just uh the Lord just have a way of bringing it together and then you say oh wow I never I never thought about it this way though I never saw it this way as the uh commemorating the 28 wedding anniversary is uh somehow special to us as a church because this year will make this church 28 years yeah this year we'll make this church 28 years and uh and uh yeah we we uh playing mauritian devils and you know before the marriage and divorce series started brother but Jordan played that little wedding that took place just before brother Branham went into the marriage and divorce series so I was sitting in the office when the when uh you know when the the tip was playing and you know all the wedding music was going on I was saying oh my God who's getting married this morning you know so so I sent for brother Jordan as I wanted to tell him as he just keep the music and go right into what the prophet said he says he said no he's you know it fit in into our time so he's fit but you know as as you sit back and and you look at things you know uh which of course we grow to understand that even as you come to church you come all the time you sit down there are things that happen you know it looks like things just go in in a kind of a routine the song leader comes up he leads songs the preacher comes up he preach you know we pray we go home we come back and sometimes is is we grow to understand what God is doing you know we grow to understand what the Lord is doing uh in the midst of his people you know so uh so as I sit back and and uh you know well just just thinking about the whole marriage and the whole series with the church I know I promise to to speak on uh on uh some things for the young people and that was the reason why I decided that we played the entire marriage in the World Series but then it became more in a place of a teaching you know because just like I said you would never understand marriage and divorce until you really studied the entire series you know but Brian preaching marriage and divorce even in the beginning of his message he says and he says and that's the reason why I spoke yesterday on the only place of worship you know so all of those things are tied together you know they are very well tied together so uh uh uh we want to say it's uh uh congratulations to uh brother uh Freddie and Sister Charlotte on their 28th wedding anniversary but it means a whole lot to us you know because also 28 is a special number you know brother Brandon who says in the message uh the call out he says wash the nature of this angel bring in the last message Before Destruction he said Abraham I'm going to keep my promise to you I love that that's our Father God I will keep my promise to you just about the time of life I call in to the time of Life about the next 28 days I'm going to visit you praise the Lord so we know that 28 is is a season of life naturally and scripturally okay so when God told Abraham I call into the time of life he was actually breathing on them uh the season of life right there there was a change that took place in Syria then she went through the stage that a woman would go through before she have a baby now so uh it's a season of life and for me what I think about it and what I will desire that it would mean to this uh uh little assembling it will be the life of God upon the people praise the Lord would now want to make any kind of a mysterious thing out of Faith but uh you know our desire is that God will be able to uh affect our lives and bring us into a relationship with him praise the Lord that's the most thing that matters for us getting in a relationship with the Lord Jesus that's that's a whole lot to do people and we are living in such a time where there was an image I was going to show to you I never I never thought to send it to the to the to the technician so I will I will skip that and so that's that's our desire you know just like we said on Wednesday night uh talking on Danny hearing prophecy and uh uh making you to realize that uh our faith uh is expressed in the choices that we make praise the Lord so I pray that the Lord will will help each and every one of us there's just a whole lot to do in a way that we can get involved uh you know and be part of what God is doing praise the Lord amen you know sometimes you you you say those things and it's so easy for the first thing in our mind for us to pick up is uh you know Church attendance notice that it's not just to have everybody in church having everybody in church doing nothing is is the worst thing that you want to do amen but you want for people to be at a place where God will be dealing with their hearts and then you know there will be fun in your place and finding things to do for the Lord and for the kingdom and also for the body that they are associated with so we will ask about Dan can you uh can you bring brother Freddie in we asked him to come and they have desire that we we pray for them as as the uh celebrate this marriage anniversary away from home uh in the Congo but yet home will be our children the the acts that we that we pray for them so our brother will come and uh praise the Lord and so we will we will just uh let's just let's just play something here then [Music] let's bow our hairs together now Like A Moment Like This foreign

scriptures I won't be long and I'll read in the Darby Bible foreign said it but that'll be wow so I would read Psalms chapter 86 from the first to 11th verse okay I would read it bow down thy ears oh Lord hear me for I am poor and needy preserve my soul for I am Holy oh thou my God save that servant that trust us indeed be merciful unto me O Lord for our cry unto thee daily Rejoice the soul of that servant For unto thee O Lord do I lift up my soul for thou Lord are good and ready to forgive and plentress in Mercy unto all them that call upon thee give ears O Lord unto my prayer and I tend to the voice of my supplications in the in the days of my trouble I will call upon thee for thou will answer me among the gods there is none like unto thee O Lord neither are they any work like unto thy works All Nation whom thou has made shall come and worship before thee O Lord and shall Glory thy name for thou agreed and doeth wondrous things thou Our God Alone teach me that way oh Lord I will walk in that that truth unite My Heart To Fear Thy name amen and the second scripture we'll read in the book of Ephesians Ephesians chapter 1 . [Music] in only the tenth verse of the first chapter of Ephesians that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are and which are on Earth even in him let's pray send your stupid name Lord Almighty we're coming before you this afternoon we bow before you out of the way this is my prayer may you speak to us we just pour readers of your word but you have already spoken to William Branham we are on the earth may you come now come down now and speak to us dispose no good prepare our heart particularly to listen to hear you bless your people that we have given me this chance to stand here and once again put me aside Lord and bless us in the name of our Lord Jesus amen amen you may be seated I would want to speak this morning unite Unity Oneness [Music] has spoken about Oneness and then I want us to share a few things on that subject s the dimash but the Vietnam is speaking about the Magis uh major is in the time of the Bible they were the they were studying the Heavenly uh Celestial uh Stars let me put it that way they were studying it and there were three Mages that were coming from the East they were studying stars and that was the job it is they knew one thing the [Music] when they were looking and noticed the three stars of the birth of uh cam uh jacket only and if all those three stars will line up they know that the Messiah was on Earth I don't know if you can hear me properly okay okay let's see and the majors the three matches Ensemble said if those three stars will line up together the Messiah is on Earth who is the Messiah let me see the Messiah is the union between God and Men lost this position in the presence of the Lord before the Garden of Eden man lost his position because of sin but the Messiah had to come and when the Messiah came is the the uniting uh between men and God he was he was the hope man because men lost whole hopeless even when Moses brought the law it didn't work they were still making mistake and compromising with the law foreign [Music] between men and God exactly and that's the union that I would want to speak about this this afternoon and the major eyes well when they have seen all these three stars together was on Earth are you here with me but us [Music] we have to look at the calendar of God for today let's get you because God in February it does not do anything contrary to Nature it's also a Bible for God if it is and God will do things according to Nature and if you you pay attention today you would notice that even before in order for us to have rain and the clouds has to come together and the clouds will work together and work together it's awesome and together and it will be a big block of of clouds and then the cloud will be dark and now we'll see the rain falling now and that's United United I want to draw your attention to it and they will gather themselves together and clouds they were gathered together they will unite together and after we see the rainfall s [Music] you know nature more than that I guess and we've seen uh we saw an animal on the road coming out and people are really conservative they're really looking at nature if you look at fishes before they migrate during the the spring and during the Spring the fishes will migrate but before the migration they will always gather together foreign that's nature they will gather themselves together and now they will move together it's a sign there's a sign that there's a union somewhere now know this foreign we know really well what dogs are some ducks usually got themselves together before even the move or migrate and a particular season the Ducks will guard themselves together around the chief I want you to do you understand really well gather themselves together and they will be around the chief and they will start moving but Branham says and night is only men to be bored only men get bored to be only men gets bored because the man does not realize who is his chief in this time in this hour knew us as children of God no difference we have to understand who is our chief for this time because in this time we have a chief that's William Branham [Applause] men is so confused he goes on his own way but Branham says he is a dream in that specific dreams and I get off my subject a little bit he call people foreign work it was about the right role you call people he told them you have to look at this White Rock s it is in the seals so what time what time is it he told people you have to look here right here and now it went away and you went away a little bit as all the Believers that was around him you have to look at this rock when I will be leaving and look what happened and when he went away and they lost his view from from far they lost him actually he said brother the problem is no longer here and I is and I'll go on my own way this brother said I will go out my own way this one also says I'll go my own way that's why today [Music] we have different understanding of this message and yeah [Music] keep the message pure yeah he was the only barrier of the message that's what is going on here America has a testimony you have a testimony the pastor has to come here he has to travel everywhere and to keep the the flame of this message he has to travel everywhere he has to go to Europe he has to go back he has to go to Egypt these people did not hear the message there's a testimony you have a testimony everybody the Bible says you are witnesses we are you are witnesses of Christ you are the witnesses of the chief you have to testify to witness es supposed to come to Africa and say William Branham preached the message and for some of you the shoes could you affected they have seen what God has done for this Aid s which is not in each history now look and one group went on one side another group went on the other side and the other one in different various directions but only a few group of people the main there to look at the white rocks that the pastor is leading you to look at that right work foreign we have to be faithful to this world and now look even bees they're always together around the chief they always remain together yeah they'll always gather together to make honey to produce honey they always gathered themselves together in that nature which is the calendar of God also they will gather themselves together they will gather themselves to produce something foreign the spring these fishes they always gathered themselves together before even the move uh [Music] and I'm looking for something here hmm excuse me excuse me foreign and the message the time and the sign of of Union foreign I'll put him in trouble uh time and the sign of Union uniting time and sign foreign [Music] Assam giz unites together themselves together is [Music] Rally rallies themselves around the leader they do the same thing 85 paragraph 85. did you ever notice bees uh swarming bees we unite themselves together before this swarm they swarm the kidneys around the queen every Association he says that's right uh where she goes away the go-to -law where the queen which is the chief goes eligible all of them follow me they say yes what do they do they unite before they see me the swamp everywhere fish unite themselves together before the spring run out in the ocean [Music] around every four years and die as soon as this one how people you are and later on but Branham says I usually I take couple hours and I've already been 30 minutes right now but uh but to get all this in um I usually take a few few more minutes I'm just trying so that you can so that these things can sink sink in you study it when you get home notice they are they are right now uniting exactly what they will do foreign that's why we have the U.N okay the Western World uniting against the Eastern world the communism communism foreign churches are uniting together everything seems to be United uniting to themselves together and we see that and he continues to say Allah also won all these uniting of Nations and we see in this world to see the signs the singing national and National signs we see earthquake indeed universities this uniting Hassan bringing the world together bringing people together toothless at least of some all the churches together do a song all these things and while all this uniting been going on there is another Universe amen [Applause] when we're seeing all these Union also people are gathering themselves together uniting and now

[Music] yeah it's an individual matter amen amen I will read the last thing here not the Germany before closing but Branham says something here is he said the uniting and assemble the forces at the Free World are gathering the forces the communities communism is gathering together with the one of Russia and every single one of them and one is afraid of the other is a terrible sign it says the church has received a Celestial sign an astronaut an astronaut amen amen is Jesus Christ in the form of the people of fire it was the same they was in the Old Testament when he met Paul in the world up to Emmaus the same Jesus Christ today and what does it do ctors does it bring fear it brings love that unite one to the other day the same that was with Moses does not bring fear he brings love that unite one to the other okay living the amen to say amen and something malicious a feeling for one another yeah it brings the love of God he unites us and lead us let God decrease the body of

careful at where we are at um where are we at um the same way as the matter we are really in line with the word and the light of the Lord is shining on our path that we hate love that has brought us to this place we are his people but but the the price of his blood amen amen we are his children and the blood of Jesus Christ today is the message of the hour we are happy they said to be part of that family of the message in the family that is everywhere may God bless you [Applause] thank you so much and we are done I will call the pastor [Applause] thank you my friend you did a good job musicians you can come you know when you have service like this is uh it's not as it's not service that we are used to especially when you have two language in in church and I know uh it put a strain on the preacher because he's getting familiar with you he also put a strain on you because you are trying to grab what the preacher is saying and then you have to listen through an interpreter but I would say you did well this morning [Music] praise the Lord and then I think our brother he did well he appreciate wonderful message I mean and it's it's it's Timely it's timely if you are not paying attention it's timely if you are listening to the news and you see the things that is happening around the world you realize that it's Timely okay I mean he went into a lot of things of uh focusing on the unity that is that God is doing in our heart to the word but the science around us the things that are happening around us you know is telling us now with everything that is built in between Israel and and Iran Israel trying to to stop Iran in all the the explosives that they are building in Iran is a great supporter of Russia so now Israel is bumping up to stand with Ukraine so all of these things that are happening I mean things are happening so fast they're they're I mean you don't want to be caught on the way you are a people that have been taught a people that have sat under the message unless you are just listening to it for fun but these things must not take us on the way so I believe the message our brother Freddie preached it's a timely message if you are paying attention to the things that are happening around the world the things that are happening even right here in the United States [Music] the only thing that is telling us is is we must get back to the basic we must get back to the things that are important [Music] praise the Lord amen and I mean uh he spoke there about representation is scripture you know it's representation Paul says by one man's sin that's Romans chapter 5 and by one man also so that's the reason why God raised up one man in every age and we come under that that man message [Music] praise the Lord brother Branham he types uh uh uh the the the lining of the of the of the the stars that the wise men saw uh he talked that with the lining of the five stars that that you know that was up there in uh uh uh 1961. now so brother Branham tied there to to make us to understand that if if that was a message that was announcing the birth of the word it announced the breath of Christ praise the Lord he says what what is this five they're lining up of this five star also announcing is announcing that another word is about to be born that was announcing the opening of the seals Christ to be birthed in the manger of our heart that's what it was announcing [Music] praise the Lord and we cannot follow all of uh things that people are saying on the internet about the message about brother Branham for us to start to draw back in our shared and start to hide away from identifying with the message or identifying with the prophet you cannot have a message until you have a messenger you cannot appreciate the message until you appreciate the messenger [Music] there's a farm balance in the midst of whatever people are doing what we do here we appreciate the messenger of the hour we appreciate the message of the hour [Music] and Jesus said blessed is he that is not offended to me thank you [Music] praise the Lord you know when you have uh when you have a translation and you as uh as an audience being people that are in the world and in the scripture you have to grab the thought of the preacher if you start to Major on the word the person will just say one thing and then you will just you will just flop out it's just because you are listening to grammar but there is an internal thought that is moving in the building and that's what God want to use to capture our heart to bring us up [Music] the day of redemption is not bad I feel it for fear oh be filled with the spirit your life dream and clear yes look up your Redemption oh yes the baby of redemption is not man's heart I feel it for fear be fair with the spirit life dream and clean yes look up [Music] a Redemption it's not a man [Music] be filled with your spirit the line trim and clear oh God your Redemption is now yes Nations side [Music] of these numbers [Music] foreign [Music] oh return all this pastel is now foreign [Music] [Music] the day of redemption is that man has [Music] filled with the spirit your life dream and clear yeah look up your Redemption is of course Professor because through may I be mine that Jesus the crisis Our God to this generation let's bring us [Music] our Redemption is not mess us [Music] filled with the spirit your lime trained and clear I Hallelujah Hallelujah let's bow our heads together praise the Lord [Music] Softly [Music] just few days ago I think it was yesterday or the day before I think yeah the day before yesterday China had a balloon in there running over Canada and and the President Joe body in order that it should be blown [Music] and the military couldn't do it because they were afraid that it was hanging over population so they were trying to wait for you to move over the ocean and when it got over the ocean they blew it up foreign intelligence [Music] all of these nations like the prophet taught us the spy on one another and with and we've all the the military and the nuclear things that is cramping around the world there is something that is cooking there are things that are happening it is not to make you afraid because you are not supposed to be afraid of it but it is for us to examine ourselves if the word is uniting in his power they are uniting their nuclear forces they are uniting their army they are uniting all their rights and they're uniting in every way God's people was to be uniting with the word is the word that keeps us together the word is our value that's the reason why we are here you are not spending time with the Lord you're not really spending time with the Lord in prayer if you have not got your ass together standing the word of God and having communion just having a long time with God this is just to remind you when the bride leaves from here when the Rapture take place even as we look at the dead and the time that we are living in the Bible says because iniquities are abound the love of many shall wash cold time that we spend talking about things that we have no business they're talking about a time we spend on TED Talk and Facebooking compare the time that you spent with the Lord what a meditating on his words what are listening to a message what a listening to a music in meditation just the time that we spend with the Lord you will realize that we spend less time and sometimes we have more time for nothing let's just use this little moment after the preaching of the word just like our brother said nature is God's Bible [Music] when the winter is coming the birds gather together to take their flight down south they always move together because there is strength in unity two were agreed upon anything [Music] but who cannot walk unless they agree they have to agree not agreeing on our opinion saying let it agree on what the word says if this is what the word says let's drop our feelings drop our thoughts drop our selfishness and just take what the word says let's just take this little moment I don't know where you are with the Lord but even as we will be back this evening for the community service let's use this time and put our hearts before the Lord and we are not on the place that we supposed to be it is not too late we can reconcile with God if we are not taking a stand for the word and we are not making a choice yes give me oil in my life keep me burning Lord I me this I Pray give me Lord in my life [Music] oh keep me burning till the breakup I need your love I need your love in my heart
