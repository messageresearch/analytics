amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you let's just take our Bibles thank you musician amen I can't wait for you to get a pastor maybe I can apply to be the song leader amen her brother Lawrence out glory be to God I can help Lawrence out to be the song leader praise the Lord thank you brother Lawrenceburg Lawrence have to make some sacrifice and since brother Hillary and his family away he had a uh us excuse from his work to kind of Step In to Lee songs last Sunday and I'm very grateful for that praise the Lord amen first king chapter 3 first king chapter three tonight I was going to speak on Solomon in all of his glory but while I was driving coming to church I was playing uh first king chapter 3 because in chapter 3 then chapter 4 it mentioned a little bit about Solomon glory and then something caught my mind uh something caught my mind which of course we we may mention on that but let's just read uh first king chapter 3 amen did I say first king chapter three Oh I thought I said Solomon Chapter 3. praise the Lord where you know that uh it would not be strange if I said Solomon Chapter 3. yeah praise the Lord amen let's read from verse 7. let's read from verse seven this great uh dream that Solomon had in prayer that he had let's just read that and then uh so tonight instead of talking about Solomon in all of his glory I really I really was I was going to bring a comparison about Solomon glory and the glory that came upon the temple because Jesus was the one that said that he said Solomon in order of his glory he was not a raid like one of the ladies that grew in a mod amen so I wanted to bring a comparison tonight and and talk about uh how God looks at the inner Glory that he puts upon the church even though we go through uh different and uh struggle you know in our faith in our health and different things but uh there is so much Glory that is better than than Solomon Glory that's why I wanted to go tonight but for some reason the Lord can afford uh moved my heart in this direction I I feel that it might it might come edifying for the service on Sunday so I don't know but let's just go this way praise the Lord verse 7 and now oh Lord my God I will reread from verse five uh you give a good good thanks to you and give you and the Lord appeared unto Solomon in the dream by night and God said ask what I shall give thee and Solomon said thou art has shown unto thy servant David my father great Mercy I call in as he have walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with deed and doubt has kept for him this great kindness that doubt have given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day and now oh Lord my God thou has made thy seven King instead of David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go out and come in and I seven is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be number non-counted for multitude give therefore there are seven and understanding how to judge the people that I may discern between good and bad uh for who is able to judge this great this that is so great a people and the speech please the Lord that Solomon has asked this thing and God said unto him because thou has asked this thing and and have not asked for thyself long life neither have asked riches for thyself none have asked the life of that enemy but here is even God said we know sometimes we will ask the life of our enemy praise the Lord amen none have asked the life of that enemy but have asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment we want to talk about Discerning judgment tonight the Lord bless you have your seat we will continue to read amen we will continue to read right from there let's just Keeper in the scripture praise the Lord let's just keep writing the scripture there praise the Lord are we together or home okay let's let's continue to read verse 12 behold I have done I calling not that I will do now so a principle yet I want for us to see and I said it the last time uh uh God knows our heart he discerns our heart amen so we have to realize yet is the other Solomon asking this thing expressed what his heart is praise the Lord if if we are asking contrary to what our heart are we we might sound good in our in our expression to the Lord we might we might be thinking you know uh uh you know what but God knows what our heart is so see he's telling Solomon not that I would do what you have asked but I've already done it amen I've already done it it's it's one of these places where uh uh you know uh uh Laisa saying the woman that will come out and and give me the uh my cannabis some water and yeah Elizabeth I mean uh Rebecca comes and directly she goes to feed the candy so it is it is right here where a man finding the heart of God a man saying something that we pleases the Lord amen just like when David prayed and he says my God my God why they have forsaken me those that were in the temple they would think that they were oh my goodness what is this guy saying God has been good to him you know but their prayer pleased the Lord so much until Jesus could pick it up and if you realize that was one of the prophecy that deliver our lord Jesus when David said he will not leave his holy one to see corruption so David prayer became a prophecy it was pleasing to God so that that is that is the that is the thought year a man saying something that is pleasing to God both our heart and mind and tongue all lining up together before I have done I call into that verse Lord I I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there is no like thee be there is none like thee before thee neither after the shall any arise like unto them and I I have also given thee that which they'll have not asked both riches and honors so that there shall not be any among the Kings like unto thee all that verse and if thou will walk in my ways to keep my status and my commandment as thy father David did walk then I will lengthen that days so Solomon a walk and behold it was a dream and and he came to Jerusalem and stood before the act of the Covenant of the law to offer burn offering and and peace offering and made a feast to all his servants now this verse also bring another thought to the story Solomon is having the dream actually all of this is taking place in his subconscious it's not like he's actually praying before the Lord but see his attitude coming out of such a spiritual dream he goes straight to the house of the Lord praise the Lord it's almost to say that I was not even taking on this Lord and what what a dream bring to pass what I have dreamed tonight he went straight to the house of the Lord he went right before the Ark of the Covenant his pray his hands to God praise the Lord and thanking God and saying now our Lord thank you for giving me such a spiritual dream I think that should be our attitude now watch now this is the thing that caught my attention he just had a dream the Bible says he went to the house of the Lord he went before the Ark of the Covenant and he he offered brain offering and peace offering and he may Feast to all his seven then came there are two women that were halots praise the Lord on to the king and stood before him now as I was as I was playing the the scripture War coming to church and and thinking about this what caught my mind here is the other see how the holy spirit is joining the two scene together in my mind Solomon just had a dream think about the whole base activity now he gathered from bed I believe he took a shower and got himself ready and said I must I must go to the house of the Lord he went over to the house of the Lord and you have to realize that these two women never came to the house of the Lord they never came to the to the to the temple or the Tabernacle to meet Solomon no they went over to his place now but what he's saying here is that the holy spirit is bringing is merging this scene to be able to vindicate what God had just said to Solomon so God is putting an event to show that and I will I will give you wisdom so the Holy Spirit now is giving us an Evidence of Solomon wisdom praise the Lord you read the verse as if to say is an immediate effect Noble is God's choosing a sin to be able to vindicate what he have already said that I will give you wisdom praise the Lord because you have not asked for long life neither acts for riches for thyself-known asks for the life of the enemy but you have you have asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment praise the Lord now God now is is is he's now going to show us what an understanding heart is now going to show us how we can bring right judgment praise the Lord because you have to know the man that brings judgment he's like a mediator and a worker for mediator is is a difficult work because by human nature we term to be buyers amen we turn to be biased the first person that you know tell their story is easy to fall for that story until you hear the other person's storage and then uh you know you you start to look at the condition and I mean that's that just that just human nature but by the Holy Spirit we are not supposed to be biased we're supposed to judge by the word of God Amen we're supposed to rightly Josh by the word of God but see that's that's the thing that caught my mind that's that's the thing that uh that that was just dwelling on my mind I ran straight to the to the office and and I just prayed I said Lord I don't know about I will I will get away uh from what I had on my heart to speak tonight and just look at this Discerning judgment if I if I turn out to be long and then it's by mistake but I hope not to be long let's read one verse here over in Hebrew Hebrew chapter 4. Hebrew chapter four Hebrew chapter 4 verse 14. seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession that's how fast our confession amen for we have not and high priests which can now be touched with the feelings of our infremities but was in all Point tempted like as we are yet with our sin praise the Lord so Paul is saying that what make Jesus high priest work effective is because he can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities so it make his high pre-work effective it makes him to rightly intercede for us because he knows what we are going through praise the Lord so he can rightly judge our matter because he's not he's not in general a sense he's not looking at the heart was seen he's looking at the inward emotions are we together he can be touched by the feelings of our infremities so God here is showing Discerning judgment the gift of this sermon you will see that's the reason why the gift of this sermon one do not discern their own needs the gift of discernment that the Lord told Brother they gave us for the people was not for him he went he went many years with a stomach ache and yet he was Discerning people and telling them what was their problem and praying for them and Jerry said he's dying with a stomach ache because the gift of discernment is always for the people so you see God is now showing us here praise the Lord how to discern judgment simple will bring a lot of different stories to you recourse to you how to discern judgment is to step in the shoes of others simple that's what make our lord Jesus work effective is What feelings feelings he's touched by the feelings of our infirmities there is nothing that we are going through mentally emotionally half-wise that he's not touched by praise the Lord so if we can confess it to him if we can confess it if we can see it just like we are going through it then you can put him to work because he already know what you are going through now what makes the work hard for him is when you are saying something completely different from what you are going through then you make the work difficult for him because he already knows what you're going through he already knows what's on your mind you already know uh you know all the things that uh you know uh uh bothering you and and even all the good things that you are also appreciating of his grace he knows everything are we together so here is God now telling uh Solomon placing this before Solomon that I'm going to give you I'm going to give you this gift it is God's gift God becoming man God leaving his holy State and dropping in an ethnic body praise the Lord that's the greatest gift God coming down to to live like them feel feel their pains he says I'm going to give you this gift since you you didn't ask for riches and uh I'm going to give you this gift and what this gift is what this give this Discerning judgment now so wash wash the scene here now that's the reason why you see that's that's why brother Brahm says God interpret his own word that's the reason why the Holy Spirit put this encounter in the scripture because how was Solomon George this matter how did he came to a judgment all Solomon was looking for is that which one of these women really have feelings they're how he judged the matter their sort of woman says uh uh you know we were sleeping there and and you can you can already know that she's the fourth one because she's doing all the talking she's doing all the talking we were sleeping there and and just one sleep over my child I wake up and my child is dead she's doing all the talking praise the Lord the prophet of God says he says those men of all those apart Apostles they were men of few words he said because there was there was there was just a whole lot of her burden that was on the heart they spent time doing all their talking on their knees they spend time doing their talking before God they didn't have time for who says what they didn't have time to to justify themselves and and defend themselves they'd go on their knees praise the Lord so you can always you can already see that she was the faulty one because she's the one that is not written the only time The Other Woman spoke that was the real mother when she said no my Lord she can have the child that was the only time she spoke and God these uh designed a judgment he he gave Solomon such a judgment without smiling you know he just listened to the story come take the baby take the baby just play the baby in two and uh uh uh you know uh he's he's giving command he's talking to them and and uh you know uh just to watch and all he was looking for was feelings all he was looking for was feelings praise the Lord and you cannot rightly judge if you have lost feeling if you allow the Martyr to get the best of you that you lost feelings you get into a place where you don't uh I mean it's it's all about you and you don't care about who says watching and and you just go on and on and on and on praise the Lord are we together even our lord Jesus in his mediatory work the only quality that he keeps that connect us with him is his feelings praise the Lord that he's touch feelings of our information are we together now so uh you just look at this and you see yeah you know he he give this great discernment and then and this or this other woman woke up out of me and she she went uh the Bible says here in in the last two verse of chapter 3 then the king answered and said give her the living child and in in in you know why slay it she is the mother thereof and because she she expressed a Feeling uh praise the Lord because uh that's that's one of the things that go goes with motherhood praise the Lord I mean uh is is is an instant of love that that a woman have for any child praise the Lord I mean even before she she she entered into that motherhood it naturally comes she loved doors and and I mean she take care of them just like they are living being they are not even uh one Chinese man make their daughter and put in the store that your mama buy for you and you love it praise the Lord so even if that was not her child she had the character to be the best mother to that child and the scripture says and and and and and all Israel heard the Judgment which the King has George and the fear the king and instant fear came on the people see how God works all God have to do is to just do something miraculous once in the midst of the people praise the Lord in the early church the people there the church is growing in you know and people are coming in and they miss multitude and people having attitude and all of that God it was just one service with ananias falling dead and the Bible says fear cut the people because now they know that that God is in their mess praise the Lord just one thing that God will do the people love and and and uh David and fear him for his War skill yes Solomon he's he's just a teenager Solomon was just a teenager and God is trusting him with with this uh responsibility but you see God will move in such a way and he will do something that will make the people not to despise his youth praise the Lord wow how did he know that I mean there was no DNA they couldn't do DNA then and to prove DNA and wait for DNA test and and all of that there was no time for that but just that judgment anybody in their right mind will say oh yeah right yeah I never thought about it but uh I mean he's right now I don't want my she must she must be put in prison she must be charged and condemned for everything she accused her friend how does she know that a woman slept on her baby if she was sleeping praise the Lord so sometimes when we do too much talking before you finish doing while you're talking you finish implicating yourself Infinity telling all your story are we together and all Israel heard of the Judgment which the King has judged and the fear the king for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment they realized that this teenager this teenager praise the Lord can you imagine how the people will walk before Solomon to realize that he he having social wisdom and they will be talking as soon as the year that they can come let's let's keep quiet because that guy when he look at you in your face he can tell straight what is in your mind praise the Lord he just brought such a gift and he arrested the people and it humble the people it's not the man that humble the people is the gift is the Holy Ghost are we together amen but you see God teaching us the gift of discernment you know people want the gift of discernment like I said the last time and I mean people anything because there's there is there is there is there have never been a time in all of church history look a man like FF boss wolf and the boss were brother those were men that were on the field they were preaching the gospel those were people that believed in Divine Healing but church history will tell you there have never been a time where the gift of discernment was so accurate now there is somebody in here that have had it no your name was called your address was given not only that thy gift will go back in your life and tell you when you were a child how you came to that condition amen is so much when FF bustle ever Boswell have already gone into retirement he has left the fee from preaching he was a fit preacher he was a man I believe in Divine Healing but when he sat in brother Brandon meetings and he saw the gift of discernment that all man got so energized he said this is the thing that we were waiting for and he came out of retirement and got right back into the field praise the Lord amen now never been a time and and and many of us some of us that never even tasted Pentecost to know what what what actually the Pentecostal blessing is our morning Pentecostal Church they have turned to Prosperity Church but I mean what actually the Pentecostal blessing is praise the Lord because in the Pentecostal church I'm telling you uh I mean the gifts were among the people until even when the preacher comes to the pulpit he has to come anointed and with the right life because all mother will sit right there and break on a vision and say that man is not qualified to preach to us just last night you were on the street running after the girl praise the Lord and we come coming to the to the to the message of the hour and and and and in tips we we hear those uh uh discernment meetings and we read them in bulk and pretty soon you know while uh people break into impersonation praise the Lord now you think about it God is telling Solomon here I will give you this gift there have never been a man before you all they have never there will never be the man after you Jesus came and broke that ring when he says the greater than Solomon is here so if that gift will ever be manifested it will have to be the spirit of Jesus Christ back in the church are we together praise the Lord but even see our lord Jesus see our lord Jesus look at the woman with the blood issue how did she connect you with him feelings she just touched him praise the Lord and the Bible says she's she started in the scripture as a certain woman they had the Bible call her but when Jesus turned and descended her he said daughter she started as a certain woman she end up as a daughter he was more effective because he could step in the shoes of the people praise the Lord that's the effect that that is the power of the gift of discernment is to step in people's shoes not psychology not said that and read their minds or sit there and think okay okay okay I know where they are going oh I've heard this before I've seen this before it does not work like that that's not the gift of discernment you have to step in the person's shoes praise the Lord glory be to God he stepped in our shoes when he took on a 16 element body when he took on a human body he stepped he came down from Glory in our shoes born of a woman cry like a baby and was tempted in every way the Bible says yes without sin why he had to do that because he wanted to be touched when we are going through what we are going through he wanted to field it so he got the feeling from the womb to the Grave he did not Escape one he know what it is when the core body is laying down in the grave and he knew exactly what it is when he raised up from the grave also praise the Lord he knows what the agony of death is praise the Lord he's touched by the feelings of our infirmities so as I was looking at there tonight try to bring you up to a close here make sure I try to finish it by nine o'clock amen so I can allow you to go home and now I thought about this and uh I have a few coats up there from the message standing in the Gap well better Brandon will bring us his own life experience when he got to the place of losing the feelings for the people praise the Lord this prophet of God with the greatest gift in his life he took a complex but Abraham says what made him to get to that place was a complex he took a complex and complex will run you out of feeling complex will run you out of feelings when you take a complex that they don't love me he should start running out of feelings for your parents and make children to be disrespectful it may cause my wife to get into problems and even affect us when if the devil can feel with the thought that God don't love you see what you are going through then pretty soon you have you have no drive you have no strength to worship Him you just show up in the form and you don't even care praise the Lord oh I wish we can take time and talk on complex and just break it down I don't have time tonight I will stay with this and then that's a recipe for the northern night amen praise the Lord Hallelujah the prophet of God got to this place brother Brown says how how did he got that he says uh uh uh he got to that place because he Fair used by the people he Fair used by the people in a sense where the people only wanted him to discern their knees and pray for their sake but they were despising the words he were preaching they called him electric on learn they would not want to receive the truth from such an electric man but when they have sick need right around come and pray for my sake so he Fair used and God gave him a complex praise the Lord glory be to God amen being born on of our natural birth we are already born in complex so complex is is one of the easiest thing to pick up it's so easy to pick complex very easy I don't care who you think you are it's easier to pick up a complex praise the Lord because you see a a complex it's easily built under the sense of rejection when a person feels like they are rejected then it's easy for them to pick up a complex a person can feel rejected just by look the way he looked at me wow praise the Lord it's just so easy you don't have to say I reject you no just by look praise the Lord I told you about a story about my cross eye so if my lock is offending you just tell yourself your brother won't have a cross eye because sometimes I'm not even looking your way praise the Lord the natural birth put us in that condition praise the Lord we love birth under the original word that God designed for us to come so with with all the the the the the chromosomes from our mom and dad and Grand and all the genes that is running down from ground we just in that mix so complex is an easy thing to build easy but here is the reason why the devil uses complex is because he wants to get you out of touch because if he can get you out of touch and isolates you then he can work on your mind and destroy you so let's just read a few years from brother Brandon I have a few minutes here and then I'll let you go tonight praise the Lord amen can we say thank you Jesus amen now brother Rod Robertson have told Brother Branham a dream he had told brother Brandon be dreaming and I might read something to you coming up here to be able to show you some paints that uh that man of God went true and and it helps to be able to learn praise the Lord because sometimes people that don't learn and know these things they get to the place of deifying brother Branham no he was a man he had to learn now Rob Robertson told him a dream that he was going to be stunning it was a dream or a vision he was that he was going to be standing like Moses he never understood what that was until he started dealing with this complex are we together standing in the Gap do you remember what uh brother Robertson told you in a dream he says the Lord was reminding him now in his dream or the vision that you have you had don't like Moses you have you have forgot the feeling of the people now that Direct instruction was not in the dream brother Branham is interpreting he's saying that now because he understood what the dream made are we together you have forgot the feelings of the people you forgot the call that I call you to let the sick laid I want the Lord to tell me where to go or not that's wrong I have built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message and God forbid that I I would try to compare the life of now like Moses but it's exactly what Moses did the people won't listen to him when he come to deliver them so he just he just left him alone and went into the wilderness but God turned him around and he how long forgot the suffering of the people because he went away for 40 years praise the Lord so when he came back this time he was not connected to the suffering of the people because remember he was he was in the palace in each in in Egypt when he stepped out of Palace out of the palace the very little time that he spent with the people it was when he sensed that Rejection it says we'll make you Lord over us are you a judge or a lord over us do you want to kill us like you did that Egyptian he took his feet praise the Lord he picked his feet up into the Wilderness he went are we together so he didn't know the suffering of the people now he's coming back with a Divine gift but with mixed feeling praise the Lord he remembered Egypt for the evil that they have done to the Hebrews when he remembered his own people he remembered the rejection praise the Lord Hallelujah so can you can you imagine after Moses went to meet Pharaoh the first time and they had to increase the burden and the labor of the people what a place it put him praise the Lord and everybody's saying why you even came back here for it was better you were you were dead in the wilderness you have you had just come to increase our labor and everything but if he never met the Bernie bulge that's where the burning bush experience make the difference if he never met the burning bush if it was not in reality that he threw his rod on the ground and pick up a stepping all the raw turned into a serpent and he had to pick it up again for it to be a rod in his hand if he never had an experience of putting his hands in his court and taking our lepers he will not stay another day praise the Lord he said that's what the burning bush experienced that's what the Holy Ghost does even when even when it seems like we are failing he gave us strength to stand there and face the failure when it seems like we are rejected he still gave us the grace when it seems like the people are not hearing he still gives an anointing for you to preach to them amen praise the Lord but it's a different thing when the anointing words out and you have to go home and start to think about all of that after being burned out after everything you put in and to know that the people don't want to heal praise the Lord if God don't call you you will use your teeth to dig your grave oh Moses lost the feeling of of his people because they wouldn't listen to him praise the Lord just at the time where God will vindicate him and the people will start saying the hand of the Lord the supernatural all he is gaining courage he's getting courage he's getting acceptance of the people you see that's the reason why I said it's not the things we are saying with our mouth all we are thinking in our mind is the thing that is down in our heart because pretty soon all of those people they started rallying around oh thank God for Moses Moses you're you're showing to them and they are talking all of that but it will not be after a few days there will be the very same people that once again will be showing a sense of rejection he brought us in the wilderness to die on and on and on and on Moses will deal with rejection constant rejection from the people until that prophet of God will lose it and say you rebels and in a natural sense he would lose his reward of taking the people over you can take that in a natural sense but that was the end of his ministry his ministry will continue because he was a type of Christ so Joshua is the Holy Ghost type of Christ amen that's what in Joshua chapter 1 the uh the Lord will tell Joshua as ours with Moses so will I be with you are we together but that constant sense of rejection how Moses would deal with that he couldn't even stand the first rejection so much that he said God I can't talk he only said he can talk because he did not wanted to stand before the people so God has to give him a shared Aaron will be your spoke man praise the Lord Moses lost the feeling of the people let's get this down so we can close up here tonight we're having more days to preach because they wouldn't listen to him now brother Rod you see it you see your dream and uh and now I cannot go with a Ministry like that until I feel different in my heart about it no matter if God did tell me but that is but that is that uh change that uh that brother wrote the same coming something God to change me because uh in my heart if I go out they're feeling the way that I do I still feel that they ought to have heard the message your superbrand is caught in this place because what what is happening here he's seeing the change of the ministry he's entering into his stair pool is going to be the word is not going to be all of these signs and one but the people keep pressing on him for signs and wonders you have seen the dead race you have seen cripples less growing out blinds eyes being created in the soccer in in the socket of their eyes why why can't the people just raise up with faith human being we just like drama we just like drama no matter how sign the word is preached we just like some kind of for performance praise the Lord because if we put a a a a a a tip to play tonight everybody with keyboard yes the word of God is is powerful but we will feeble on the table we just want some kind of a drama somebody doing like they say yeah let's see human being with light drama are we together hope we can get a right kind of for drama though so he's in this problem with him you know I have a message to give to the people what would turn the house of the children back to the father I must not be caught up in this place of just gifts and gifts and gifts praise the Lord Brother man will be preaching all of those uh Seminary preachers who put their hands in their pocket they walk out of the meetings as soon as he comes to prayer line and everybody come there sitting down attentively they are watching even close your eyes they will not close their eyes he will say buy your hairs and close your eyes they will not close your eyes praise the Lord and with all of those things that they saw the yet will not believe they are either opening their ass to look for fought to love for who name was called and go and ask that person but he was seeing the changes of his ministry he was saying where he got a story that he he got to give this food for the bride and the people are saying you're taking one hour two hours to preach praise the Lord you get sick people lying all before you go back and look at Allen video overview you don't even see the message they just come out there to read a scripture and write that or it's it's just all healing and praying for the sake but we have to realize we will get sick again praise the Lord amen men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God because when we are rightly taught in the word you don't have to wait for the Evangelist to come in town you know how to get a hold of God foreign need I really need help he's telling the church I really need her how much more of level of earnesty can we see from a man brother ban himself with a Divine gift that God has given me I could hold the Nations under my finger King George of England they had to fly him over to go and pray for him under my finger or if the people if that's if it is just all praying you want it's easy because he's born with a gift for vision but he knew what his calling was he knew what his responsibility is praise the Lord here on God under pressure by the people Moses staying long Iran Moses stay alone let Bill our own God before Moses would bring the word to them they have built a golden calf they have their own God they have their own Idol because their impatient nature of men to wait on God together he don't want to lose the feeling of the people so he he he he he got caught up by their pressure many people building idols in a home because they're looking for Supernatural they're looking for a vindication we already have a Vindicated message amen praise the Lord I don't need self-indication I have a Vindicated message that's enough for me I'll point you to all the Vindication in the word are we together he says I need that change in me I don't I don't want to be standing there praying for people and thinking in my mind that these people have rejected me I want a connection praise the Lord and the prophet of God will tell us is one of the rain that God broke into that's why he made the universe that's what he he brought for his attributes because he wanted to make contact with what he had in his mind praise the Lord every form of relationship if God lost feelings for us Good Shepherd we are dumb who just be here like a dead Church what we want we want almighty God praise the Lord to be touched by the feelings of our infremities amen we want him to be touched by the feeling that of the need of this church how much we need the Holy Ghost we need a new birth how much we need a spirit of conviction in our heart not just a claim without the reality may he be touched with the feelings of our infremities that's the thing that keeps life that's the thing that keeps the body Glory that's the thing that keeps family the relationship going you lost feelings that's a cop cops ready for the mall ready to be buried they don't have feelings that's a dead body amen when we lost feelings for what God is doing in this building we are just only concerned about our own unique life praise the Lord Hallelujah amen I've I look up that story but Dan was talking dead about the the London Fire uh because I was blessed by that amen and it's uh is is such a notable story it's written in many different articles about the three brake layers when that one says I'm building a cathedral praise the Lord while one was working for his family and one was working I mean maybe to secure himself a job they were all doing the same work but one had a heart to see a cathedral to find a place of worship praise the Lord whether we are sweeping or whatever we are doing that'll be our heart that we want to build a place for the presence of God I'm coming here because I want to be a place I want to be part of what God is doing here you know it's not that selfish saying I want to come here to serve my God carry your God we don't need it here we have only one God and that's the Living God when people don't want to listen to instruction that's when they take their attitude I want to come here to save my God keep your God to your house worshiping in your in the room of your idol you can make it decent now so let's just close this thing up here but around says I still feel that they ought to hear the message the old they ought to have done it I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have until I can get the feeling of the people there is no need of me going because they be a hypocrite praise the Lord amen what around will talk to stories about God that wrote only believe all things are possible one time leaving his home after getting in in a little talk with his wife and he would kiss her going out he kept driving looking in the rear view mirror and seeing her standing and he turned around and came back and can't start again brother Brown says he says he said the second one had a feeling in it I did the first one because it was just something we do all the time but he he got repentance he turned around he came back and did it right let's just read this last one that we closed here pray that God will place in my heart that's something that I have lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a complex this is so easy I had an interview the other day with my brother will sitting sitting here you see if if you really follow this story that's that was what make brother will die when he fell dead and brother Brown and prayed for him because he was on a complex praise the Lord he was sitting in the seventh brother Branham was preaching and he just allowed the spirit of complex to get him and he dropped dead his wife was a nurse she said his pulse is gone it's so easy to get a complex I had an interview the other day with brother well sitting here standing here in the front a good man but Bill himself a complex built himself around accomplice and not a kind of a complex did the same thing real well you can so easily do it it's you just just get a little something in your mind just a little something in your mind just a little something and many times that little something makes you to feel special just a little something in your mind why would it look at me like that why would it talk to me like that is you just get a little something in your mind keep thinking that way go back and check it with the scripture and see if it's right or not and then go from there on yeah don't lose feeling of the people see you must remember they are not made out of Sawdust they are flesh and blood human beings and the soul praise the Lord amen and that's some of the reason why you know why uh when a man is honored the anointing and he's preaching and the Holy Ghost is is dealing with us and and rebuking us you know that when a man is just fleshly and he wanted he want to now start attacking the people just to prove that uh uh uh you know me I don't compromise praise the Lord as long as the Lord will help us unless I don't feel that way I would rather I would rather be wrong I'd rather I would choose to be wrong than to find a man wrongly attacking the people of God praise the Lord I made out of Saul and does they are human they have souls and after we take our time to come to church with all the struggles in all the wars and everything we want the Holy Ghost to come and rebuke us we want the Holy Ghost to reprove us if he tells us we are wrong he must tell us what we need to do for us to get out of it praise the Lord oh there the people say I can't say Amen the people they are not even pray up the people are praise the Lord the ministry of the church is to raise up the dead body so if we are all dead your ministry must raise us up raise us up let the Holy Ghost goes through you that will say something that will edit father people that will wake them up musicians you can come tonight let's just buy our heads and as a church let's get to that place tonight if we will be Earnest with ourself and be Earnest with the Lord unless the Lord give us another order but like I said we will be approaching the communion there are some things I will tell you on Sunday I mean for all of the years that uh I've been here working with this church and and being the pastor of this church we have gone and we are going through one of the difficult times this assembly has ever gone through I see things I see things and just giving it to the Lord well I believe in my heart I believe that we are at a junction we are turning a corner so I'm not discouraged praise the Lord I'm not discouraged by people attitude I'm not discouraged by people slothfulness and all of that no I know that we are turning economy but it's been a block of time we have gone through some of the difficult things that we have ever experienced as a church I mean there have been a time where we have four person in church that was not difficult praise the Lord I mean there have been times where there are uh uh you know I mean different things but I'm I'm I we would talk a little more on that on on Sunday let's just buy our house together [Music] but what I want us to do tonight like the Bible says let discern the body of the Lord when the Bible says discern the body of the Lord
