hands together for jesus oh yes [Applause] amen amen amen actually this morning i jumped over protocol i didn't even read the bible this morning but the bible verse this morning is coming from luke chapter 19 verse 39 to 41. um let's just read that quickly um say and some of the pharisees from among the multitudes said unto him master rebuked thy disciples and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if this should hold their peace the stones will immediately cry out and when he was come near he beheld the city and went over it amen so we don't want the stones to cry out in our place this morning sing sing just sing amen and just give everything to god amen because if you don't sing the stones will cry out in your place the stone we sing in jesus mighty name all right let's go ahead and sit we have a testimony this morning we have um brother daniel jr yeah welcome god bless you um a while ago i came and explained how god saved me from the case that i was going through and how i was able to get a departure for it and i held on to that promise now i was supposed to go back on the 23rd of march to get a sentence me going on the 23rd of march the devil tried me in a lot of ways leading up to that day the the departure that i got now i'm standing on faith and i'm trusting in god throughout that whole entire month at the beginning of the month i talked to somebody who um is an acquaintance of mine and told me about a statement that the person who i'm going through the situation with can also go about writing as well to explain their parts of it and why the judge should not go about giving a departure but once again i'm holding on to faith and i'm trusting in god the victory is already given to me nothing the devil could say to shift my mind whatsoever another thing one about happening like a week later a person i used to know in the past hit me up saying that the person who i'm going through the situation with explained to them that i'm going to end up going down for everything that happened that whatever they're going to write is something that's going to make me get locked up or be locked up for a long time so the person called to ask me about it let me know what the person that said to them just to make me aware of it and in that point in time a lot of things crossed my head but i told that person whatever that person is trying everything is already over i already got the victory no matter what they try to do god has already shown me that everything is done they said okay then i really seen a pain on mine to it so i just said okay conversation went a little bit and it was over now those two things kept coming back to me a couple of times throughout the month of march before the 23rd came and each and every time they came i would cast out in the name of the lord jesus christ because the devil has no power amen so close to the day of the 23rd um i kept praying my parents kept praying me and my brothers and kept praying the day before the 23rd the 22nd i was sleeping and i woke up in the middle of the night now when i usually wake up the best thing to do usually would be to see god see see what the reason is for while you're up like on the 22nd i woke up and something told me to just grab my bible and the first um the first thing i opened to was uh ezekiel 13 verse 17 which said likewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people which prophesied out of their own heart and prophesied thou against them verse 18 and thus and say thus saith the lord god well to the woman that shew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls will ye hunt the souls of my people and will you save the souls alive that come unto you verse 19 and will you pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread to slay the souls that should not die and to save the souls alive that should not live by your line to my people that hear your lies verse 20 therefore wherefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against your pillows wherewith ye their hunt of souls to make them fly and i will tear them from your arms and will let the souls go even those souls that ye hunt to make them fly verse 21 your critiques also will i tear and deliver my people out of your hand praise god and they will and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and ye shall know that i am the lord like after i read that scripture that morning that case i was about to happen the rest of the morning i just told myself everything is over everything's done i already got the victory ain't nothing to it no more so i ended up going in i talked to the person who was supposed to defend me and told me exactly what i held on to for the entire month for months the promise that god gave me that he already talked to the judge everything was supposed to go out supposed to get the departure just like everything that's been going on and we're just going in for me to get sentenced and that's it i went in there and exactly like that female had told me that um everything went about that she had talked to the person and the person i told her so that the person um is going to try their hardest to say exactly what they want to say for things to go their way and tell the judge like things just to make me look like a monster that's exactly what happened the person went about saying a lot of things that even i myself was like wow somebody could really hold something like that towards you about the same time like your pass is your passion god said what happened so so the judge heard all of that and the prosecutor must have told the judge that there was something that him nor the public defender was supposed to talk about which was the time that was supposed to be given to me the time was not said because the prosecutor had said if i take something along with the plea deal that basically neither one of them were talking a push for me to get a departure i don't know if you guys remember and by me taking that he wasn't supposed to say anything but the devil trying to keep playing his last hand thinking he has a last hand the man says something he told that day he wasn't going to say he said it that day i went talk to my public defender a little bit came back even after the judge heard what that um person had said what the prosecutor had said he asked me if i had anything to say anything to say i explained my part of this situation told him mom changed told them how crisis really saved my life and i'm just a different person and through out each and everything that happened i ended up getting that departure the same exact thing the lord had promised me so i just like to thank god amen all right lisa right time is

the lord is our strength amen praise the lord hallelujah and [Music] i mean since you are happy this morning and ready to praise the lord and let jesus praise him amen hallelujah amen hallelujah uh let's think uh this little chorus we we uh [Music] what a wonderful thing to be free from sin amen let's just sing that chorus and and praise the lord this morning [Music] one [Music] is right now oh [Music] with jesus praise the lord the lord bless you you can have your seed amen while we go over our announcement this morning praise the lord just before we go into the world this is uh a month now since we voted our our deacon in office so we would take this morning to be able to charge our brother by the word and uh and and ordain him in office this morning so we would do that just before we turn to the pages of the word amen and i'm sure that uh the easter weekend services were announced we will have brother robert wilson from uh illinois chicago visiting with us himself he's a missionary brother so we will have a some of his missionary report of the different different works and different place that you'll be going so we will have a service on friday night which of course we will trust the law to have a convenience service at that time i'm sure that before that time we will talk with the officers and the brothers to see if it will fit every one of us as a church to be able to do fault washing so that would be the 15-16 and the 17th of april praise the lord [Music] and you know the the the old saying that says that if you don't want anybody to hear what you are doing don't say it in the walls because you see these walls they can hear when you say things in the walls pretty soon the wall starts to speak praise the lord so a lot of things being said in the walls and and then even the walls in my office start speaking to me praise the lord so there there are some upcoming weddings that is becoming a romance in the church it's just going from one ears to another years and and then i'm feeling guilty because i've never said anything to the church and the walls are speaking even the roof of the building is talking the doors are opening they're all talking so we have some upcoming weddings and which of course is a beautiful thing uh praise the lord uh brother brother ariel will be doing his wedding on may 28th [Applause] so they have chosen the easter weekend to to to announce their presence to us so let's be on the expectation praise the lord and sister bridget will also be doing her wedding [Applause] that would be in july and that would be back home in liberia so she suspected to travel and uh and we pray that the lord will be able to to bless her amen and sister russia also i thought we're supposed to be going to the coming of the lord but but i think it's i think it's a wonderful way to prepare for the coming of the lord and praise the lord so uh uh praise the lord well yeah but that's what i said if you don't want me to yeah don't say because these walls were hearing when you start talking things and the walls hear it i'm going to hear it and when i'm going if i hear it i don't want to gossip so [Music] i would tell everybody praise the lord so uh but we thank the lord for that and we prayed and we will do everything we can as a church to be able to support these ones praise the lord and uh uh brother we have brother joseph and uh and sister leah they have been with us uh for i think this is close to about six months now yeah about six months brother brother joe and cecilia sister leah came ahead she was expecting the child so she came close to be with her parents and and close to a maternity center just in case and brother joseph was going back and forth and then they moved over and uh and he got a job uh over the albert uh northwestern hospital but because of some job situation uh some situation other jobs in and uh and different things that were going on there he you know actually he studied with the texas a medical center there in texas which of course allowed them to have what they call a fellowship you know is is almost like a kind of a group that monitor uh your progression in your work and you stay in that community of uh of of workers it helps to be able to they can make reference of you they can you know and all of that so because of the uh kind of unhealthy work condition that our brother was experiencing at where he was working and it was kind of sort of a difficult choice but they would have to move to virginia where he would be working in another medical facility there so that should be coming up here quickly uh uh i think uh the facility there has already started to box their things and get them ready to move there so he can save at a facility so uh we appreciate having brother joseph and his wife with us and [Music] it's a kind of a tough call but we we prayed and asked that the law will bless them and and we would tell them that if you once made a home in minnesota you always have a home in minnesota amen i know just last week i came right out of the service there and then brother vincent and uh that used to be a professor from zambia he called me from uh [Music] indiana because he was dealing with something and i'm i was saying to myself you know and call me you know and says brother juan i need to talk to you do you have some time i said go right ahead i was getting ready to get to the airport after the service and then he went on sharing what he had to talk so we we just spoke took over an hour trying to to help settle him down so we we we always do that so once you have a home in in minneapolis you always have a home so we will pray that the grace of god will will bless our brother and his wife and and and bless their children as well praise the lord amen we uh uh so on the list of uh what we have as as announcement uh if anything this keep me in i'm i'm sorry but uh we will we will call the but then we come up and and brother ben also uh let's turn to us chapter seven while our lincoln brothers come as chapter 7 and just like we said this goes back to a couple of years now where we we we first choose our our first two deacons there's brother steve jambibi and also brother brother ben uh this they were our first uh two deacons better steve john bb you can come up also [Music] so because of uh brother steve uh because of brother steve age brother ben treated brother steve as this as the senior deacon you know so if there was if there was anything you would say well let me talk to birthday first you know and uh and i appreciate the way that both of them work praise the lord amen sorry i said i said as chapter seven it's actually as chapter six i will read as chapter six years and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a multitude of the christians against the hebrew because their widows were neglected in the daily administration then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and save tables wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of earnest report fault of the holy ghost and of in in wisdom men of earnest report fault of the holy ghost and wisdom whom may whom we may appoint over this business but we will give ourselves continuously to prayer and to the ministry of the word then the verse five goes down and and shows the different men that were appointed uh by the by the brethren to be that they come and we know stephen and phillip actually which of course philip was an evangelist but yet the brothers choose him to be a deacon that's why you could see bert branham could use brother collins which was a medi pastor as a deacon and and some of the brothers that served in the branham tabernacle because uh the the qualification goes very close to that of the ministry so uh uh this is uh the biblical record where deacons were first choosing and appointed in the scripture to be able to save their office so this local assembly has been able to find brother uh dan to be a brother of on earnest reporting and uh the man field of the holy ghost and wisdom and so this morning we will appoint him to this business to be able to serve the the this local assembly as a deacon but steve jambibi we will say thank you for your service you say thank you for your earnest and your dedicated service uh that you that you give to this local assembly praise the lord and albert steve will always come and and clean the church the purpose was not actually to clean the church he was actually coming to pray you know uh and then he would stay around and do some few things you know so he actually started doing the work before we even put him into the office of doing the work you know so uh we we appreciate you and uh and and we we uh we love you but ben we also say thank you for your continued service and [Applause] so with this we will we will buy our house together [Music] father make us one [Music] that the world may know that you said you're [Music] make us [Music] fire [Music] while the musicians softly play let's pray together as a church let's just pray that the lord will be able to bless brother dan and empower him to take up the challenge and be able to serve us as a deacon let's pray also for brother ben that will work that he will be working with that the law would just bless them the law would bring the unity and strengthen them and even brother steve jambibi we will pray that the lord will bless him and keep him in good health and strength let's pray together in jesus name heavenly father almighty god as the church of the living god we just come with god father lord this morning oh god father to pray for our deacons lord o god

take our bibles and praise the lord we'll take our bible sin we'll take our bibles in daniel chapter one in daniel chapter one let's let's just take daniel chapter one in daniel chapter one praise the lord if you uh taught him praying for us this weekend we'll tell you that the lord heard your prayer and he really came to our rescue for some reason i had my stomach battled me it just just kind of kept me flat yesterday and i thought i was uh you know i've always believed that i i eat anything anywhere and at any time praise the lord but it looks like [Music] my body is beginning to tell me young man it's not the same amen praise the lord so let's let's just turn here to daniel chapter 1 and uh and we will read from verse 8. now these were now among these were the children of judah down here hananiah's meshia and hazaria unto whom the prince of the eunuch gave names for he gave unto daniel the name of bethesda and on to dragon and to michael misher in hazaraya at bennigan but daniel purpose in his heart that he would not define himself with the wave the portion of the king's meat known with the the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuch that he might not define himself now god have brought down god had brought down you into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuch let's let's pray together father i just asked your blessings you will come and help us now lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen the lord bless you let's go to uh saint john saint john chapter 16. that's actually where i want to take my mind my thoughts from this uh this morning and i will just share a few things with you before i get right into that it looks like i've handcuffed myself here praise the lord it's in john chapter 16. now uh uh you know if you if you are a student of the world you will know that us in john chapter 16 year uh is jesus promising the the church of the holy ghost a man the comforter and when i was in in when i was telling this on the weekend i was i was impressed to see that uh when brother brandon preached what the holy ghost is he read the very same scripture we're going to read and then also when he preached the message on the comforter he read the very same scripture that we're going to read and in this morning i'm i'm going to go uh into a territory uh i want i want to speak on the power of conviction i want to speak on conviction i just titled part of conviction but actually i want to speak on conviction and and the reason why i want to speak on conviction is because i i realize that that's what uh that's what we need that's what the hour that we are living in uh we we need is is very important let me share something with you before we go into that uh this morning i came across an article praise lord i came across an article that i was reading and in 1972 there was a case that went to the supreme court of america and in this case it was uh an amish man that refused that his children he pulled his children from out of the schools and uh and he refused that his children would not go to the schools i mean when i go to whether it is private or it is public so because of that the the the local authority told him that if he if he don't do it and and this did not happen far from us it happened right here in wisconsin so uh uh they told him the other uh i've just tried to to just read a few of them it's a kind of a long article it would take all my service time to go through it so [Music] the state of wisconsin advised him that he must to which he replied i do not think you hear me i'm not going to send my children to your school and he was threatening of being sued if he refused to comply but still he refused he was warned that if he was sued and if the state won the case he could go to jail his only response was that he would not send his children to the school even honor the threat of losing his children he refused to change his mind [Music] explaining that his religious belief prohib prohibited him uh from complying with that demand so the the case went to court they took the case to court he still refused he never altered his position and he was phone out something very interesting you will find out something very interesting after losing his appeal he case went to the supreme court of america praise the lord the court said now this is what is going to be interesting the course said the first definition the court made was every religious belief is one of two types it is either a conviction or a preference it is either a conviction or a preference praise the lord and the beautiful thing there is that i was i was already studying on the subject of conviction before i came across this uh this article so it caught my attention it caught my attention because i'm realizing that or we are realizing that you find people that have stayed around the church and stayed around the message and stayed around in church they were brought up in church they were taught bible verses i know the bible from cover to cover and yet at a certain point in time in their life that says there is no god praise the lord and and and and and then it starts to draw my mind to to this uh conclusion that is supreme court may and i wish of course there are some other things that i will share with you that uh uh uh is this is this has has the message become a preference to some people as a good way to bring up your children as a good way to to love your wife you know like your old brother told me one time i love him one old brother he told me he says he says he said brother juan you know well that was that was years back he said brother one you know you know i love this message because it helped me to save my money i don't have to buy makeups for my wife he said i brother i love this message he said brother i love this thing you are preaching so so that's where we are and every one of us in this room this morning are faced with this every one of us sitting here this morning i'm bringing heaven to be our jury i'm saying heaven witness us this morning and may i have the grace to lay this word of god before you that i will not have your blood on my hands because every one of us sitting here this morning are faced with this is this word like brother branham who says in the church age book are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst are we having a conviction or this is just a preference because you know we love the preaching we love the atmosphere you having the conviction so that was how the supreme court began the case that was their first definition that every religious belief is one of the two it's either a conviction and the court defines what conviction is to the court conviction is something that you are ready to die for you can be imprisoned for it the code also says their their uh uh uh you you're ready to die for you can be in prison for it and uh there is there is nothing that alter your stand that's a conviction praise the lord now i will tell you that i'm now working for the supreme court amen i'm working for a higher lord praise the lord so i'm not going to use the supreme court as my measuring stake i have to use god's word as my measuring state are we together but that's what the supreme court established that if they will be able to judge a man and he says that this is his conviction he must be ready to be locked out for it if you say well you know what that's what i believe but you know having young children no it's just a preference to you the coach said it is just a preference it's not a conviction are we together amen and uh and i mean i mean it's it's just it's just it just broke upon me and i thought my goodness my goodness is this is this what has been happening is this what we are dealing with around around the christian faith and you hear people well you know well my father was a pastor you know we grew up in the church we signed in the choir and this this and and one that and and and now you know i i believe uh you know uh i'm i'm not supposed to be a board i'm a guild and you know and all of that praise the lord which of course that also is a preference now so you see all of these things it really brought me to a place where i have to to look at you know and most christians carelessly use the word conviction in reality the test of weather or net a matter is a conviction is a very severe one and not to be taken lightly that's right if you say this is my conviction you shouldn't take it lightly it have been that you have sought it out you have searched the scripture you have prayed is now follow follow no it's not association praise the lord we have been saying here that most of us possess only preferences we possess preferences because we are so easy to flip and flap praise the lord amen it it's easy to go with everybody yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah then uh uh when when they step on your toe then you jump back and say no i'm not going again if it's a conviction you must be ready to die for it in john chapter 16 let's look at something in the scripture a little bit then we will come back to then praise the lord i'm really really really trusting that the lord will help me to be able to bring this to you if i'm not able to bring it to you like the way it came to me then it was only for me it was not for you praise the lord because sometimes the law will deal with a person especially the preacher and it's just so wonderful and it's not actually for the people it's for him so maybe god want to bring me into more conviction let it be lord be unto me [Laughter] praise the lord it looks like the lord wants to root my feet down in the word amen to not be afraid and intimidated by the faces of the people glory be to god jesus said in john chapter 16 let's turn them let's read from verse five but now i go my i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asked me where to go at that but because i have said these things unto you sorrow has filled your heart nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for for you that i go away praise the lord for if i go not away that comforter will not come unto you the thought there is that brother branham make us to understand the thought there is that all that was in god he pulled in christ so that's why he said it is expedient that i go because my departure will give you everything that was in me will be pulled back in the church are we together amen i said jesus if if i'm here i will be robbing you you will be lim you will be limited because all power in heaven is giving unto me but if i go then i can transfer it everything that was in christ was pulled back into the church are we together praise the lord verse 8 and and when he is come which is the comforter the comforter is the holy ghost when he is come he will reprove now that word reprove is the word in some way that kind of limit us from seeing what is hidden in that scripture because the word reproved here actually means convict in the way that jesus is saying this you understand it as we go along and when he he is come he will reprove the word if you have a bible dictionary which tells you it means convict he will reprove the word of sin which means he will convict the word of unbelief praise the lord he will bring a conviction that's the reason why when when when when the when the presence of the law when when the atmosphere is created and the presence of the lord has come down you know the sinner knows he's wrong the word convicts it has the power to bring you to attention i said look my friend you got to do something about your life this thing you are doing is not right it will convict the word of sin it will convict a word of righteousness it will also convict the word of joshua praise the lord amen i mean with what is going on in russia now everybody mine you know all the all the peoples that get bunga they are starting to stall in their house is this world war three is this world war three why because the word has already said it amen and the word has the power take for example with uh with uh uh uh with the coronavirus everybody that you know uh uh you know all on the net in everywhere the mark of the beast the mark of the be why why are people so quick because truth has already declared that there will be a time that the world will get in this state so when little things happen there's a conviction that comes in people is it this is it the word has the power to convict a convict the sinner of his wrong and convict the christian of righteousness and that is the place where the believers struggle we won't have the time to deal with that this morning but i would like to go into there because that's what the holy ghost is supposed to do the holy ghost is supposed to convict us that he became sin for us that you might become his very righteousness you have to come to that conviction you have to come to that conviction that's the work of the holy ghost in the house of the believer that you have an advocate the advocate for you that even if our heart condemns us there is one that is greater than our heart the believer has to come to that place that's the work of the holy ghost to constantly convict the believer it's already done the price has been paid glory be to god amen jesus said of sin because they believe not i mean amen of sin because they believe not so sin is unbelief amen of sin because they believe not are we together oh praise the lord my goodness you will you i'll give you i'll give you on an assignment you you study through the scripture and you will realize that let me let me take let me take uh i'm i'm kind of looking at uh few of them here i want to keep this for another day but it will help you or it will help every one of us to be able to look at uh first king chapter 14 quickly verse verse 16. there's a principle there praise the lord first king chapter 14. first king chapter 14 i'm going to go fast and and he shall no oh yeah 14 verse 16. and he shall give up gave israel up because of the sins of jeroboam saints now watch the s now who may israel to sin and uh who they sin and make israel to sin now so you will see that the principle runs through the scripture you have uh uh uh you will have a new testament approach to that uh let's look at first john let's look in first john let's look in first john one of one of the closest scriptures we can look at i'll take time to go over here i won't do it tonight or this uh uh oh man it's a night no it's afternoon i'll do it this afternoon we'll find time uh first john 3 4 says whosoever committed sin which is unbelief transgress also the lord for unbelief is a transgression of the lord okay verse 5 and you know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin so you see the scripture used sins and sin and what is trying to show is that sins originated from sin and sin is unbelief are we are we together okay so that's what jesus is saying here he's defining it he will reprove the word of sin because they believe not so he will convict the word of unbelief are we together amen he will be he will he will convict the word of unbelief he will convict the word of righteousness because i go to my father that's what he just said previously i will go to my father and the comforter will come to you so it will not be the believer that will be practicing church rituals or church other but it will be the comforter that will be living the word through the believer that a believer can say that is no longer i that live it but christ that lived in me the believer has to come to that conviction that we have to believe in the finished work so that is the work of the holy ghost he will convict that he will convict them of righteousness oh my goodness that they will they will be able to see see your life they know your past and see your pressing line saying no it's not really this guy why is what what is he doing he's convicting the word of righteousness praise the lord i will tell you that for a long time i got stuck right in this place these verses for a long time have just hanged in my heart i said i just i said lord i know there is something in there praise the lord amen oh my goodness oh my goodness god is good amen god is good he's wonderful he will convict the word of sin and convict the word of righteousness and he will also convict the word of joshua because the prince of this word is josh praise the lord amen he will convict this word of joshua because the prince of this word is george hallelujah then jesus said this more powerful statement i i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now oh my goodness praise the lord can you imagine some of the things that moses kept in his heart to tell the children of israel when he went on the mountain and came in the presence of the pillar of fire there are some things you just have to hold to your grave praise the lord can you imagine some of the things that the prophet held in his heart you cannot bear them unveiling of god brother branham says it's almost like saying something and not saying it he said it's like saying something and not saying it oh my praise the lord are you ready for the word praise the lord it just looks like we must we must worship again to stand up and get into this okay it looks like he's is uh it's a tough thing to get into amen but we will we will trust the law to be able to help us to talk on the power of conviction so i get back again to my supreme court story praise the lord so you realize the the court of the of the land the highest coat of the lane in america came to this place to be able to draw the line between what is conviction praise the lord and what is preference amen and the code came to this place i believe because of you know uh uh all of the changes that have happened [Music] even right from the reformation all of the different things that have been happening around christendom how people there were there were priests monks having you know a change and became reformers and how people that were staunch believers change to become rappers and all of that so this this constant uncertainty has placed the church the i mean the quote to the place to be able to come up with this decision amen the code says that if if you can if you can be influenced young people by peer pressure the coach says you don't have a conviction you just have a preference maybe as a young man you're a young woman you just you know you're following your your father belief or your mother belief you know and then when it gets to the place where you you you face a little peer pressure uh then you you turn to jump in with a crowd you dance like them you sing like them you uh uh you run around like them you know so uh uh the the the court of the land now you know is saying that uh you are not convincing us enough young man that you have a conviction you know you can tell us about daniel and tell us about moses you know and and david and goliath but the way we see you going shows us that you know uh christianity is a preference for you praise the lord if you come on a lot of pressure you might become a muslim tomorrow that's what they are telling us if you come on a lot of pressure if you get to the place where it says if you don't if you don't pray like a buddhist who cut your hair off you might say no i'm a buddhist praise the lord that's that's that's where we are driving this thing tall is this thing life to you praise the lord this has to be your life you have to hold to this like life and death oh yes you will not stand the test of time praise the lord the court says well if if if lawsuit if lawsuit can bring you under pressure that if you don't do this will soothe will sue this church if you refuse to uh perform gay marriage we will sue this church and by the law we will lock this place up if lawsuit will change our position then we don't have a conviction this message has just been a preference for us are we together a cult says if jail pressure will make you to change if jail pressure you will go to jail if you say you believe it will lock you up in prison praise the lord i have a i have a little testimony thing that i play in my in my vehicle that uh uh is from uh the uh church of the maritimes and i i went to one of the seminars and bought some of the assets and this one it has testimony real life testimony and then uh it gives us testimony and they also have prayer requests to attach to it so i remember this one you know in my mind it's one of the ones that play of this uh uh you know uh lady there was that was uh arrested because of her faith in one of those muslim countries you know and she was locked up in prison with her with her little daughter you know and and this is if you deny jesus will set you free you know and and all of that and you know she came under this pressure and then uh she taught on her little child this this poor little thing you know my fate is affecting this innocent child so she she uh she uh after a couple of days she called to the warring and says are you going to give up your face she said yes so they let her out of prison so as they were going back to their village her little child look i heard and says mama i don't think jesus will be happy with you she said she said she said honey it's because of you that's the reason why it's just because of you if it was only me i would stay in prison she said mama if we go back to prison i'm not going to cry so her mother turned around and went back to the prison and tell them i don't deny my faith [Laughter] [Applause] this is a real life experience what are you going to do what are you going to do i'm not here to tell you stories this is a serious business before us can you labor with people run to convention where people think tomorrow you see on facebook there's something different this message they just made me all you've been all ever since you've been all ever since praise the lord you know where the word cosmetic is from chaos the word cosmetic is from chaos when you are trying to put order on chaos praise the lord let me let me stay right here so this is a serious thing that's the reason why we can now over emphasize the importance of the holy ghost can never over emphasize the importance of the new birth not church membership not hanging around of or what i believe in what i be what i know an experience of god the quote says if death can change your position if death pressure say most people do change their belief on a death pressure praise the lord the court says then you you did not have a conviction wherever you have held for 20 years or 30 years 40 years it was just a preference and to think about it how people can be so zealous you know they can be so silly as they can they can be oh my goodness when it is not really a conviction do you see why jeremiah said the heart can be deceitfully wicked i mean that a person can be so deceitful to themself can be so deceitful to themselves when they know that they have not completely sought out that's the reason why elisha he killed the calf he burned all the tools because he knew he was so out he had nothing to return back to praise the lord you see how people can be deceitfully weak they know that they are they are not so out yet young people the base are becoming tense the days are becoming evil praise the lord you better get your share of this pentecostal blessing now so in one sense the code is bringing us to the place to realize that these people that call themselves christian put them on a little pressure you will see what is in them all of those disciples following the lord and uh uh uh uh you know uh i hear the messiah is coming get out of the way get out of the way the great teacher is coming when he came under pressure their master was captured even the one that said over my dear body he said i don't know this man praise the lord it's a serious thing that's right so from that man that amish man stan this case went to the supreme court praise the lord amen and there was one there was one david gibbs jr that took up the case i decided to go and defend this man in court i mean there's just a lot of things there that we can we can be able to go through this morning but that's the reason why i read uh daniel chapter 2 because the bible said when daniel got into uh babylon it's it's it's amazing it's amazing i want you to grab a principle here the scripture has a lot of secrets amen when you read the scripture there the bible called the names of shadrach meshach and abednego and even daniel was named among them praise the lord the scripture called their names and what happened is that when it comes to the next verse it says daniel purple's in his heart and they're not talking about shadrach meshach and abednego why that is the kind of a thing in the scripture that makes me to say why were they not all together praise the lord but the reason is because daniel was the leader he was the leader so you see that the holy ghost has a way to flag things out it has a way to flag things out to be able to grab the mind of the believers because we know as you read down through the scripture you will realize that they are purpose in the heart but daniel was the leader in one sense we can say he was the messenger so the bible used that as representation it was not overlooking the stand of the other one but this is the man that is the leader he's the messenger so he has the representation that he purpose in his heart that he will not define himself praise the lord because scripture will prove to us that when daniel came under the test of time with the lion then he stood on his conviction when when the three hebrew boys came under the test of time where the furnace fired they stood on their conviction praise the lord so for them it was not a preference because they said king let us let you to know this that even if god don't deliver us [Music] if god don't deliver us we're not going to give in praise the lord hallelujah amen so we realized here i mean there are a lot of things that we can go into let me get out of this a little bit and get back to myself here there are a lot of things that we can go on to let me share something with you uh a jubilee year brother branham talks about uh uh you know the jubilee year and he was talking about the spirit of conviction there were some things that he said and and i really appreciate it it kind of forgot my attention he said the only thing in this or the only thing we need is the holy spirit to come in convicting power amen except god gets out among the people and goes to moving god must not stay on the tapes he must not stay in the bible let god get out among the people if the people can grab it they can stand and live by it praise the lord if it's just uh uh if it's just a unity thing oh let's let that come together and come together pretty soon you realize that yeah i mean you only get warm when you come together praise the lord and then when you get away you don't even know what what what you know what what you you stand for yeah i've seen people in in in horrible state they said among unbelievers and they ridiculed their faith because they laughed about every foolish thing the unbeliever says about christians praise the lord praise the lord remember brown talks a little bit there in in jubilee year he was talking about the welsh revival he was talking about how how the how the people were on a such a conviction people came to be safe without a preacher because the spirit of conviction was over the city oh how i love to read those things amen praise the lord when i get into those things and start reading my goodness it's like i mean another word he says when the revival started a minister went down to a place where there was a a cover that crossed the road and he got it he he stopped his hearse and he got he got over this carpet and said almighty god this city is all polluted down here sarah caused every man and woman now you see this man went out he was not preaching he was not in a church he was not having a prayer meeting he was so burdened about the the the pollution the wickedness that was happening their drunkiness and all the violence and sex us that they were carrying out he was so honor conviction he went out got down he he just laid his hands there and said oh god they said crying over the city cause every man woman born or girl that passed over hallelujah discovered to fall under conviction by your spirit [Music] praise the lord smith weegerwolf he was another revivalist that came just before brother branham smith would coming he would go to a bus station early in the morning he would just sit down he was a man of prayer he said to the bus station and just prayed and said almighty god i pray the spirit of conviction in this place lord the people that are coming right here to take this bus may they fall on a convection and people will come there they're coming going to work and and you know hurry get to the bus station get right there and they fall under convection and start crying praise the lord think about it they never had a song leader to leave songs they never had musician to create atmosphere praise the lord but yet they could bring the spirit of conviction down and people will sit in the atmosphere of worship the lord they sit in the atmosphere of worship in the atmosphere of of of of of praise and prayer and when the world are supposed to bring conviction to you comes you sit there and you are slipping away you have your mind all the way from you they never had no music this might go right into the street that was how the welsh revival was born are we together whoever pass over this border girl man or woman cause that they will fall under conviction by your spirit he went and got a good faithful warrior stuck him on that place to pray stay there there and now fasting and praying praise the lord how a conviction comes to the church when the church have thrown fasting out of the window how a conviction comes when the people cannot even exercise themselves to keep their face before god and say god i want a conviction i don't want this thing to be a preference to me the lord amen you know that conviction conviction is coming close when you start thinking about losing the things that you dearly love their conviction is coming close when you start thinking about losing the thing that you hold oh so dear if you if you have not stopped thinking about that yet you're on your way you are you not get close yet are we together he went on into the city and he asked permission to ask a blessing at the table can you imagine a man just walk into the restaurant and says praise the lord good morning people can i just pray for the full year can i just pray for the food you want to buy food no i just want to pray that god will bless your restaurant praise the lord they say oh yeah go ahead and he start praying lord you bless this table lord father anyone that sent you to buy food and eat give them the holy ghost father bless these people deliver them from drugs deliver them from alcohol [Music] the explanation before the dinner was self and he stood and said lord cause every man woman that said at this table to come on a conviction praise the lord and this boy did i bring his girlfriend take somebody else's daughter run into the place let's get some you and go and dance and they sit down right there the spirit of conviction hate them christ the lord i'm sorry sarah i got to take you back home praise the lord amen you can just see the reverse when the spirit of conviction can deal with people and people can walk from right in the service walk through the door and go do things that their conscious will tell them this is not the word a christian do not do this [Music] and they still fight their way to do it it shows how much convection we are losing what a day are we living in what a time i mean when you see everything that is happening around uh uh around the faith make us to realize that is not just caught in courts praise the lord it's not just parking the bible under your arm it's whether this thing is to you it's life [Music] praise the lord because how many men has built wealth wealth that they will not use for the rest of their lives they have built wealth they have stolen money have re-estate when this one is just only a preference to them and after they have settled down in their wealth and said so i brought brandon make mistake praise the lord one of the richest richest pentecostal preacher here in america when he reached to his place of wealth he says well i think we have this whole thing about satan we have we have we have over emphasized it a pentecostal man i would say satan can be saved glory be to god glory be to god hallelujah but says in the message god's way that being made for us he said you know what i think i think is conviction instead of conversion because that's what we have had we have had conversion from one belief to another belief praise the lord i didn't believe it was revealed now i believe his reveal amen i didn't believe what that church stand for i believe what the truth you are just you are just conversing you are you are changing from one state to another but the things that matter in this is a conviction something that strikes home praise the lord i said a little bit i was going to speak something on on the spine i'm trying to see how i can work my way into this i shall we trust the holy ghost to help us here he said i think that's what it is i think it's a it's a conviction instead of a conversion when a man is born again of the spirit of god what we need today is not a proactive meeting what we can do to work ourselves up let's jump up let's go in cycles praise the lord amen it's it's i mean it's almost like pushing the vehicle down the hill and and so the motor can run a little bit the alternator can get some heat so he can stab crank it crank it crank it keep cranking and climbing it get on our beds brother but let the base up praise the lord when the people honor conviction knows that they are coming to the house of the lord and they spend some time on their knees and bread and say oh god make the service a blessing lord let your spirit fall oh god i want to see you lord and this person come with that desire in your heart and this other person we don't have to crank it up we don't have to crank it up we don't have to crank it up we don't have to create some kind of a uh emotional excitement the excitement comes from you you sing the song you are able to clap your hands you ever say glory to god you don't wait for the prayer blessed glory [Music] [Applause] that's right you're just cranking it up you're trying to create some excitement the excitement of a child of god comes from the world [Music] when a person can see a song that says my sins are gone and they can identify with that song they say glory to god thank god my sin is gone [Applause] oh praise the lord oh may god help each and every one of us what we need today is not a proactive meeting but an old-fashioned god sent holy ghost revival an old times car blow sin killing blood washing religion praise the lord an old time sin killing hallelujah oh may god help us church jesus said that's what the holy ghost will convict the word of he will convict the word of sin of unbelief praise the lord and he will come he will convict the born-again of righteousness we trust the law we'll be able to break that down and have time to spend in it i just want to i just starting amen i'm just warming up on this subject we're going to drag this convection thing i'm going to be just like that all repentance preacher i'm going to preach it and preach it and preach it praise the lord if you want to stay home until i get a new subject i don't know when i'm going to finish so just stay home because this is the thing that is lacking in the church and until this thing reached home until this thing reached home we're just making the church brother branham said it's for the thing to get out among the people praise the lord when it gets out among the people when young people grab this thing you are not you can you will not be suspicious in your mind thinking oh well my young people know because they have graphite when a young man starts seeing the importance of his prayer time and he will get in my closet to pray being a conscious of their own personal devotion well i read this thing in the world wow wow man i think there is something in jeremiah that says the same thing let me look in my concordance let me look at uh unbelief oh yeah unbelief it's also in hebrew okay okay let me go there then you know that the word is beginning to eat the flesh [Laughter] for the world to become flesh the world must eat the flesh and you know that the world is beginning to eat the flesh because there is there is something that is consuming your time and you love it you love it it's not that uh john 3 164 god so loved the word and he give his only begotten son and look at your phone and you're just all over the place for this world to become flesh it has to eat your flesh you have to start eating your mind consuming your mind eating your desires glory be to god amen oh my goodness what a day what a time that we are living in brother bram says and uh uh have we found faith come and see he says he says we so we pray god that you will give each man woman brother get in here tonight courage a real conviction faith that looks up there and see that that son of god sitting there in his majesty his power the power of the spirit moving in his church amen then he's not afraid glory be to god now so you see uh uh the thing just like i was talking about i was talking about those principle i want to bring your mom back again to daniel because uh you know it's it kind of sparkled on me you know uh just like i said before you know brother branham taught us that uh uh the old testament is a it's a shadow amen of good things to come that's why paul said in the book of hebrew the old testament is a shadow now you see that is that is what it is for us because as gentiles we have the new testament the jews don't have the new testament amen so for a jew the the the the old testament is not a shadow it's not a it's it's it's not a uh uh yeah it's not a shadow for them for the jew it's a pattern so the way that the jew look at the scripture see that's why moses said uh uh he gave me a parting the i building the tabernacle by the parting i see in heaven so the jew mind the word is departing is is caught in a certain way to fit certain events for the gentile mind we look at what god did in the old testament we say he's going to do the same here are we together now so you see here just like i i started there in in in uh uh uh daniel chapter two shadrach meshach and abednego they were the elect that was standing with the messenger in that day praise the lord and do you see also in the scripture also in the scripture the scripture did design it in a way where when daniel was put under the test of the lion then praise the lord do you think that shadrach meshach and abednego were not praying you think that they have backslidded praise the lord so you can see the pattern it was it was it was time for the messenger to come under his pressure because the the elect pressure is coming later are you seeing it amen the holy spirit designed it that way to put the emphasis on daniel for now praise the lord and it was also a religious pressure it was a religious pressure that came on him no uh are praying and all of that and and down here you know opening his window and and he was praying praise the lord so also when when you you know i thought about this you know some time ago i was thinking but why don't you was not part of the the the uh the fiery furnace praise the lord why why he never came to that place you know that he i i didn't believe that he bowed down to worship praise the lord but you see the holy spirit design it in a way where it took dania out it took danny out it separated him so it shows a period of time where the messenger goes through his own pressure he goes through his own of criticism he goes through everything and he's standing for the world he's defending the faith even bliss in the lion then it did not change his position praise the lord amen because you have to keep in mind god always use the pattern of the wave sheath israel believe in that amen so god had one man in in babylon that he was waving before the people because i believe it came into the the the newspaper in babylon that alimony daniel daniel had disobeyed the king and and he's going to be throwing the line there all the papers came out oh my goodness daniel oh my god this guy this guy you are not even a pastor in jerusalem why do you want to prove that the guy will put him in trouble he and that his small church uh two or three church members praise the lord okay let just see the lion will eat him they'll see how they will have service praise the lord it's good get rid of the the the the shepherd then the sheep was scattered y'all lock him up fanatics this is not jerusalem according to the commandment we must look to the holy temple the holy temple is in jerusalem we are in babylon to many of them their religion was just a preference that they have to do in a setting place they have to be in jerusalem they have to get to the to the temple when they are back to the temple then they will wear their white gown and everything will be pure you know and then they will go inside and do all their it was just a preference but the bible says daniel purples in his heart he purpose he sat down and he thought about it that's how conviction comes you count the cost you sit down and you think about it say lord i'm locking my life in life or death he sat down and he taught about it praise the lord see that's the reason why people cannot take a stand for the world may find a place to close here they can take a stand praise the lord because they have affected their spinal cord okay so i can bring my spinal cord thing in now glory be to god you know i was looking at some some information i've always believed that uh the pulpit is never the place to come in and whatever we preach it must come from the heart of conviction i believe that a man must be able to study true he must be able to really look into what he's bringing to the people of god because like brother branham says they are going to hang their souls on it praise the lord you know and uh uh you know you have you have you know people are built that way people are cut different way you know uh uh in a way that god uses them and uh and you know i was thinking about this wednesday night we read putting on the whole armor of god amen putting on the whole armor of god and and that kind of struck me when i was thinking about the human body i was i was actually listening to to uh uh you know everything that is going on in ukraine and then i was listening to uh uh uh a wall time veteran that was that was giving advices you know where he talks about uh you know you don't you don't turn your back actually there uh a man that uh that that god that god saved you know this this man are forgetting his name now he's a minister in the message but he was involved in war war in world war ii uh uh yeah he was involved in world war ii and and then he came he came to a close death experience and uh and and what and what the experience was is that they were they were in a place the docket hall they were there and then uh uh you know the uh the anniversaries came very close to them you know he had a new sodium with him and uh he's you know he said that he he didn't know what was happening you know the the young man was keep waking him up i'm hearing the sound he says well is he afraid is he really hearing something or he's afraid you know so he just uh you know uh took one of their fighting weapon i think a bomb or something throw it down and definitely you know uh the enemy was coming close to him so as he was giving his testimony because he got safe on a broad brand meeting he went to a meeting one time and brother branham you know was preaching and you know and and and he says and brother bram says many of you many of you here came back from the wall and you promised that you would give your life to god you know uh and he knew definitely he made a promise that day when he was close to death so and he was talking that and that that was when he he made mention of you know you never turned your back is it because uh the organs of your body is easily reached to your back in here now so uh uh uh so it kind of struck me when i was listening to that i just brought an entire in with efficient sex like i said on wednesday night but if you also go and look at the the way that god built the human body you know uh he gave us a div a defense system you realize that the rapes of our body the way the way is structured is is almost like uh how do you call it now it's almost like uh uh how do you call it we we use that commonly uh in africa so the rose cannot break through the window we do an iron bar we put it right between the window you know it's just like a cage you know so god the way he designed the body you know the the rapes comes year like this and it all comes from the spinal cord you know and then it wraps around to protect the organ you know so our organ is right in that cage but then you realize that uh uh uh the spinal cord is in the back and and uh it's one off one of the most one of the most just like every other organ the spinal cord is very important because you realize that's the thing that gave us a stand praise the lord amen that's the thing that have us to stand upright is our spinal cord are we together so as i taught about this i want to make some some studies young people i'm going to get on you right now but not in a bad way only if you take it as a bad way i went and made some some research and my research was uh how many you know how how is it measured because they will always tell you you work in an industry or wherever you work they will tell you that your shoes must be the most important things that you should spend on why because that's what you stand on praise the lord and the way that god made the human body there there there are nails on our feet that communicate with different parts of our body are we together amen so i went and i i started i started session on days i actually took a a kind of a diagram that i saw and i was just comparing some few things and you know and and i watched all of you know most of our young young sisters you know uh uh trying to look pretty and you you know and then pretty soon it looks like you're getting in too much of a heat but you know what what what is interesting with that is that is is proven by science that uh uh there is there is setting there there is a certain amount of heat that support your weight and your height a certain amount of heels that support your weight and your height now i mean if it comes down to uh you sisters that are married your husband is responsible for you okay so i'm not i'm not coming your way and i'm coming to all of these young ones praise the lord because what happened is that uh there is there are there are people that have had issues and and did not know what their issues came from because as a small girl they started they started crippling themselves they started dislocating their body because they were all involved into faction and you know and trying to wear the uh high heels and all of that and you know as a pastor you know i don't want to be an evangelist you know i've i've tried to to i look into the informations you know because if you even if you even study they will tell you that there are some low heat shoes that are not even good for you depending on your height and your weight also so you have to get a balance you know so i my message this morning is conviction is not high he's praise the lord is not high my message is conviction i'm just bringing this because i have taught it true amen and i don't i don't want to bring a message and just come preach and says oh i see your hees are getting high or he said no i'm not built that way praise the lord but as as we talk about the defense system of the body then the support system of the body you realize the other uh i mean it pays to be able to consider those things praise the lord it pays to consider it because there i mean there are a lot of things i can go into i don't have time here i'm not going to read those things because when i when i read those things instead of them i just take my own notes to myself praise the lord because they are they are all they are all scientific notes you know research that people make they put it online you you take it there you know i don't i don't try to to uh uh you know uh because just like i said it's only what is written in this book your soul can feed on praise the lord amen so uh if those information comes to you you just got to mix it up with your word praise the lord hallelujah and and then you'll be able to you know take it take it off for yourself you know so all of those things now so as as we as we talk about you know because conviction is taking the stand for the world and if you don't have a good support system spiritually amen you know better brandon brother brought it back he brought it right back to the pulpit he said we're having weak churches because our pulpit is weak the support the support the pulpit supposed to be the spinal cord of the church the bible call it the pillow of truth praise the lord it's a support system are we together so you see like just like uh solomon says god hit false balance that's right that's the truth god don't love false balance so you have to bring things in in in a balanced way amen are we together are you are you people listening to me young people so you have to watch that because you could throw yourself a uh you could throw your body into a position that when you get to a certain edge then you start to repaint in your back and you say i just have this back a that will not leave me do you know that people have done that and they have thrown their body off in a way where they struggle to even have a child because they have given them weak back that they have constant miscarriage so you have to get a balance are we together i'm not after you being pretty amen i'm enjoying i enjoy you dressing pretty nice i just don't want to stay on my knees praying for something that we can avoid now young people praise me glory be to god especially you younger little ones i love you you know i do i'll do anything [Laughter] glory be to god so we realize yeah we realize you know it's it all gets back to death it's all gets back to death sometimes it's just influence it's just influence we see other people doing that we do we don't have a conviction amen because your conviction must not destroy your health that's right praise the lord because of when i searched on the thing i i just looked all over and i went back also i said sir what what are the effects of uh you know flat shoes because i know there are groups around christendom that preach that people should just i mean sisters should just be in slippers did you just wear flat shoes or sanders praise the lord and you realize also there's a balance with that that's right are we together but brahms says here hidden live let's let me read this and we find a place to close here he says show only the holy spirit alone can bring conviction amen he says only the holy spirit so all that i've said to you this morning this afternoon i pray that the holy ghost really take it to your heart amen you can go and wrestle with in your mind but i pray that the holy ghost take it from here and make it a revelation to your heart that this thing has to be a conviction not a preference praise the lord not a preference because if preference your preference can change at a certain time you think that this thing is not good for me amen praise the lord and then he says well no i think now i have to do it this way but something that is a conviction is something that is grounded amen you have come to that place and you are convinced now see a beautiful thing that brother branham say here you appreciate the holy spirit he says show only the holy spirit alone can bring conviction in a man he says justification is a work of the holy spirit so what does that implies amen he said but it depends on where you are eating where you are getting your supply because you remember one time when we when we we we talked a little bit on the tabernacle that brother george preached for us on wednesday night we dwelt on that and then how we show that the holy ghost starts to deal with us even from the beginning the bible says no man can call jesus the christ except by the holy ghost so you see the holy ghost bring us to the place to believe amen to accept it takes us to the next stage so that's what brother branham is addressing here but he narrowed it down to say that it depends on what you are eating it depends on where your supply is coming from your environment the atmosphere because if you are in the right atmosphere the holy ghost is is going to bring you gradually amen the holy ghost does not come and say put your hands up you are arrested put your hand behind you no it brings you gradually amen amen if you want to understand this subject read the message or listen to conveyance and concern so better ban and preach conviction in in another way because the holy ghost it brings you to a place it convinces you of what is doing in your life it convinces you that immorality is not good it convinces you that lying is not good it it convinces you and when it convinces you you accept oh yeah you know i love it so you feel good when you tell the truth and you feel bad when you lie so it works it works with the individual as it brings you through justification and it brings you through sanctification cleans up your life then now it possess your being it dwarves in you and it takes over the tabernacle we together musicians you can come praise the lord what are we pushing here what are we making emphasis on to you this uh this morning is to be able to to express to you praise the lord jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen praise the lord he's the same yesterday to them forever it's just not enough there's another place where brother bryan sits there he says you have enough holy ghost just to come to church you have enough holy ghost [Music] to dress decent but god wants to take you beyond that he want this world to eat you up eat you up well you know that this is what i live for and this is what i would die for it's not somebody misbehavior or somebody said he said oh yeah because of that person because of that pastor or because of this person i'm not in the message because the president is a deceiver you've just been hanging around you need a conviction [Music] you need a conviction you need god to set you down and say lord convince me that this thing is truth and if you get if you get to business with god he would come down on the scene and he was speak to you and say my child this is my word because we're not following conan i couldn't devise people oh how is my desire how is my desire that god [Music] will just give us a fresh touch that his presence would just drop down [Music] please lord jesus please father [Music] you can say oh yeah that you know i was born in the

people hold to their preference and things they are holding to your word father lord gary if we are holding to your word we will follow everything true because we know there are many ways of god you speak and there are many ways that you move lord father the way your spirit will convict men of sin we don't know it so we cannot hold to our preference what you will choose to bring healing to our
