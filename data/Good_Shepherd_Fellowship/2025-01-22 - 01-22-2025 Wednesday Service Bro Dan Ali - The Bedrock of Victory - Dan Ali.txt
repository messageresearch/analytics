could we go thank you where could we go but to the house of God I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord and that should be our song tonight while we are still standing can we please take our Bibles turn to Hebrews 5 we are reading from from Hebrews 58 Hebrews 58 I read though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word amen shall we be seated I titled my message tonight the Bedrock of Victory the Bedrock of Victory praise the Lord I have not been around long enough praise the Lord I'm 60 years old and still counting so that looks like a long time and it is because I remember in those days when I would hear somebody say I'm 50 I'm 60 and I was around 20 I said why this person is old and here I am 60 and I can only thank God for bringing me this far praise the Lord because my mom told me as I shared once upon a time before I got to 6 months old my auntie put something in in a bottle for me to drink it was just God it wasn't my mother who saw it because I was sick and I had come from the hospital she gave me the first medication when it was time for the second one she went and took it and realized it was tampered with she pour some in a spoon and realized the color was different she called my father's attention and lo and behold it was something else but medicine I got drowned when I was around 8 years old completely drowned and in between then and now a lot has happened for me to be standing on my feet at 60 years years full of life and in good health it is nothing but the grace of God when I look at myself I don't see anything but the grace of God some people talk of Grace but I live by Grace I have said it time and again that the day I fall dead it is the perfect will of God because God has saved me from time and again oh my goodness I can't count that is what that's not what what we are here to do tonight but I just want to thank the almighty God when I say I have not come far I don't mean my physical age 60 years it's a lot of time it's a lot of time it's just the grace of God and I cherish it every single day sometimes I see danger and I walk in it and God has always proved in his himself the Lord our God is faithful now when I say that I have not been around for long long but I've been around for long to know that it is possible for us to walk through these doors every Wednesday every Sunday and yet year in year out never meet the person of the Lord Jesus Christ that we can for short of meeting Christ even though we walk through the doors every single time there is church we stop at church but we never get to move Beyond church to meet Christ church does not give life there is only one lifegiver if you do not meet him I here to say that if you do not meet him you have no life whatsoever get a hold of him there is so much pressure so much pressure in the time we are living in economically politically socially you can mention it peer pressure a lot of the times when you talk of peer pressure The Young Ones think oh it's for the teenagers no there is peer pressure for any age group you can be 100 years and you still have peer pressure there is so much pressure and the devil is doing this to make sure that you don't have time to even read your Bible that you don't have time to even seek the face of God In Prayer that all you want to do is rest with the time overw yourself because the bills are mountain and mountain and mountain and you need to catch up with the bills so much pressure that you can't even stop to think about yourself we need to redeem the time because the days in which we are living are very evil praise the Lord and sometimes when you are able to even redeem the time guess what the Demons of Technology come to distract your attention Facebook Tik Tok Instagram WhatsApp mention them and when they come when you have been able to make time and they come what do they do they try to take your mind away before you realize you have wasted the day you have wasted the time and any time you waste that time is not coming back it's like pressing the trigger when that bullet leaves the chamber it never comes back you can put in another C CH but that one that left is never coming back that is the way time is if you lose the time for today for something you can never make up for it we try to convince ourselves oh I was supposed to read chapter so so and so of this verse I didn't I'm doing it tomorrow you never made it up praise the Lord tonight by the grace of God I am here to encourage you I'm not bringing anything new now this team I chose actually a brother that has come through here to minister for us on two occasions sent me something on WhatsApp and it blessed me and while I was thinking of what to say on a Wednesday night like this it just touched my heart to talk about it and I'm trusting that God would come Behind these words and then bless your hearts tonight praise the Lord I sent something there sister net if you can please put it up for me praise the Lord so this was the title of what he sent to me the mathematics of life life is full of mathematics I find it so very interesting and meaningful message to share now it is true I never thought of it but life is full of M spiritually physically economically which way you put it if there is something I am doing today and it is not helping me and I'm taking it out of my life a subtraction A Min us if I sit down and I look at things how can I make this better and I take a step of Faith or I take a step to do something economically to help my situation it's plus an addition sign if I'm able to achieve my dream how do I multiply it that is why the rich men don't sleep those of us that think we are poor we have better sleep they don't sleep they have all the wealth of the world yet they don't sleep they want to multiply it that's multiplication and when you have gotten it if you have to share with others there is a division and that is where a lot of us don't do well we hate to share we want to keep it off for ourselves praise the Lord so whichever way you put it life is full of MTH but that was not the part that actually caught me sister net can we get the second pH of it please now there are 26 alphabets English alphabets and he numbered them from one to 26 that is a 1 b 2 up to Z 26 if you can get the next one please up to Z and probably the next one good so a lot of us a lot of the times would ask ourselves what what can I do to make life better for myself pardon me I'm still uh struggling with uh make sure you don't shake my hands until i s i sanitize them what can I do to be successful in life what can I do to make my life better what can I do to achieve my dreams in life whether we like it or not everybody wants to succeed in life except somebody that has a mental impairment but everybody in their right mind want to succeed you don't just want to come and walk this Earth God just like that you want to leave something behind praise the Lord and then he P hard work if I should work very hard I am going to be very successful and then he puts all the numbers together from H to K he puts all together and then it comes to 98% it looks like it's very good enough isn't it praise the Lord but it doesn't get us to 100 the next one knowledge if I should have knowledge if I should study hard and have all the knowledge in the world is going to make me successful praise the lord it's a good thing and that is why we send our children to school we encourage them learning is a good thing and then you add all what does it give you 96% praise the Lord it doesn't get you there the next one love I just want to love just love love people and be loved back love is a great thing and we ought to love one another praise the Lord but you would realize as we go on that love does not hang in a balance praise the Lord when you add that together 54% the next one look some of us say oh life is just success is by by luck you add all that together 47 yes next one money if I should get money then I am successful if I should get money that thing we all Chase for and I believe all of us cross the Atlantic Ocean to come here and then work for money praise the Lord if I should get all the money in the world I should be successful then you ask yourself why is it that people people are so rich till they don't they can't even count your money and some of them will drug themselves to death some of them would put a bullet in their heads and pull the trigger what is the joy in it you are that all together 72% yes next education oh it's good to be educated I get my um my my college degree I'm not satisfied I'm not saying you should be satisfied with it I get my masters I'm not satisfied yet I get my PhD I'm not satisfied yet and attend all the seminars in the world thinking that would make it 92% that is good isn't it praise the Lord next leadership is because I've been following all my life and that is why I'm not making it but if I should get into leadership position I am going to make it and then you realize that it's just 97% you don't ever get there praise the Lord next attitude praise the Lord so this is where I want us to spend some time atude praise the Lord you add all to together it gives you 100% you add that together it gives you 100% I don't want to go ahead of myself tonight now attitude gives us 100% bear that in mind attitude is a great thing it is 100% now attitude can be good and it can be bad it can be positive it can be negative you can have the right mental attitude and you can also have the wrong mental attitude now it is 100% so when you have the right mental attitude it is 100% right and when you have the wrong mental attitude it is 100% wrong if it is good it is 100% good if it is bad it is 100% bad praise the Lord your attitude your attitude determines your altitude your attitude determines how far you go in life it is not your education it is not your money it is not your influence your attitude determines how far you are going to go in life and as we go through I pray God would Minister to you the way he did to me praise the Lord I was listening to um one a celebrity one time on a podcast uh the Dy of a CE and he said something he said his mother told him when he was growing that manness maketh a man and I learned a lot from that manness maketh a man it is not how good you look it is not how tall you are it is not how rich you are it is your maners that is very important and that brings us back to what your attitude so when we are talking about attitude I also want you to be thinking about character they are just the same a good character a good attitude um a good behavior a good attitude they are just one and the same so I maybe interchanging these words but remember we are talking about attitude praise the Lord you may wonder if I have good attitude how does it help if I'm well behaved how does it help if I have good MERS how does it help me it helps a gr sometimes not in ways you want but it helps a great deal there was a very rich man who died and left five children and for some reason he gave half of the wealth to the oldest and the rest of the four he didn't even divide the rest equally to the four he gave it to three and left one for whatever reason this man died and they had to share the world this case ended up in court because there was another head who was not even included in the world and they said no they have to do something that was dividing the family the oldest one stepped in and said all Daddy has been telling us is that we should always stay United but I can see that this family is falling apart after this court case it doesn't look like we are going to see eye to eye again and right in court he said you know what I withdraw I am not going to take the half that he has given me but I want the rest of the family to share this together so there will be peace in the family and that was what they ended up doing even though he was entitled to have and there was one person that was going to lose his inheritance T he stepped back and they had to share their wealth equally to the rest of the four people and guess what happened they came one by one to him oh bro we are very sorry for what happened that we had to end up in court over all these things we are sorry but you know what from what I have I'm sharing it with you gave him up another person comes oh oh bro we are sorry for I mean you took that time you have saved this family you have brought us back together we are proud of you you know what I am giving you half of mine he ended up having the same half his daddy gave him before he died and still kept the family unit there is a lot we gain by staying humble praise the Lord the Bible says Pride goes before a fall there is nothing consoling in Pride have it at the back of your mind we are talking about the Bedrock of Victory the Bible says that without faith no man can please God faith is very crucial in this journey but you would realize that even the faith you have is the determined is determined by how much by by your attitude by your attitude without that premise your faith in God HS in the balance and you would think that it is only in our Christian work no even in prison in prison if you have good attitude you are treated not as a prisoner but as a prison officer I have seen that the prisoners walk through the doors and we give them we just Elevate them give them another status we make them overseers over their own colleagues why because they have demonstrated good behavior and we can talk about Joseph that in prison he was not treated as such and that also can even give you a pardon because every year I used to think it was only in Ghana but all over the world the president gives pardon and it is the prison officers that will give a list of people that are well behaved people that have demonstrated good behavior and then they are given clemency either they reduce their sentence or they just get them out of prison for good behavior because they have demonstrated what good attitude and the police have an Unwritten love that you don't give good attitude excitation when the police pulls you over and you are not arrogant you are not arguing you are just so friendly and so respectful a lot of the times you get away it has not worked always I remember the last two didn't work for me praise the Lord but the lady did something good in fact I think I needed it it was one morning I was going to pick my wife up it was Sunday morning so she would go and get some rest and we come to church and it was so foggy you couldn't see ahead of you you wouldn't see any car all you see is that break the light so I was not seeing I was just using the road markings that was the only way I could tell I was in my lane and then I just passed and I saw the light behind me and I she was so angry you don't have to drive that way you you I mean she was so mad and I was so calm I say yeah you're right you're right it's true I'm sorry I'm going to pick my wife today Sunday we are going to church and blah blah blah blah BL and then she went I thought she was just coming to say don't do that again she brought me a citation but the good part is she reduced the mileage and she said I didn't give you I didn't put the speed limit on it I reduced it so I said thank you I got to work and I was even complaining I said she gave me the citation anyway and said she I reduced it by seven seven seven uh M I mean uh 7 m sare hour I said what does that mean and somebody said she has saved you almost $200 I said oh but that was good and the next time we went to a we coming another person picked me up so I was so nice but they still give me the citation sometimes it is good and I think I needed that praise the Lord so it doesn't always work with the police but it is a good thing to do praise the Lord even in business the people have realized that good attitude sells it is not how best your commodity is or your service is no you can have the best restaurant if you don't have good customer service nobody's coming there you can offer the best Services if you don't have maners nobody is calling you for any any service because people come they are looking at you are whether you are listening how you say whether you I mean they take consideration of all those things so even in the business World they know that to have a good attitude matters a lot praise God now look at joob can we take our Bible go job 2 job 2 we are reading from 6 to 10 and the Lord said unto Satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life so went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord and smoked job with saw boils from the so of his feet onto his crown and he took him a pot shed to scrape himself without and he sat down among the ashes then said his wife unto him do thou still retain thine integrity Curse God and die verse 10 but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speak speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips praise the Lord we are talking about attitude here that a man that was actually put to the test in fact of all humans that have lived I have not seen anyone that has gone through what job has gone through praise the Lord and with all that job went through he still stood his grounds his faith in God was put to the test and yet in all that he went through in all that he went through he wouldn't ciss God even when his wife impressed upon him to C God and die he wouldn't do it and he said should we only receive good from God and not evil just look at the attitude look at the attitude sometimes you will think a man is well managed or a man has good character wait until they are put to the test then what is in the inside is going to come out you wouldn't even know when it comes out when you are put to the test you wouldn't know when it comes out it's just going to play out because it is in you maybe just walking down the road and somebody gives me a slap it will take the grace of God for me to get up and just keep moving if the grace of God doesn't come down we may have to square it out and then just imagine maybe you are giving a slap and then you get up and then you look at the man and you look at his sture his buil and you assess the situation say no I can't fight this one and then you go that is not humility there is no humility in that it is not a good attitude it's not because you are well-mannered it's not because you have a good character no it's because you have assessed the situation and you have seen that no you can't do anything about it and people may stand and say oh this man is well behaved this man is man man is well maned no you are not well maned is because the situation is beyond you if you want to see the true character of a man wait until they are reach if they were poor if you want to see the true character of a man wait until they have power wait until they have power and then that is where you are going to see true humility and as we go on you see that when things happen and you know you have the power to change the situation and yet you choose not to that is where I want to be praise the Lord that is where I want to be it is not easy it is not a common place to be but that is why I pray to be by the grace of God praise the Lord and God requires what good maners God requires good character good attitude God requires it so much so that the Bible says that Christ himself learned obedience by the things he suffered he learned obedience that is character praise the Lord job said naked I came and naked I will go yes so long as the things of this world are concerned we are not going to take anything when we live this life we are going to leave everything back everything we ever toil for everything we ever labored for everything we ever struggled for we are going to leave it behind we are never going to carry it with us nothing Look at California this new year a lot of things happened there were a lot of Storms and we felt a part of it on this side of the world look at California that went up in Flames for over 10 days that California was burning and nothing they couldn't do nothing to bring the fire down people lost their entire world life saving they lost their home they lost everything they ever labored for went up in flames they have nothing to point a finger to so yes naked we came naked will go butam said we are not going to go back naked we are going to go back with what character character attitude good attitude that is how important it is that a man comes into this life and they labor all through this life 30 40 50 60 100 years and they are not going to carry not even a shoe latchet with them the day they leave this earth but they are going to carry what character it tells you how important character is we can never overemphasize that the character is so so so important if it is the only thing we are going to carry all our life it tells us how important it is and should never be overlooked it should never be overlooked and it is not the good things of this life that gives us character you realize true character comes through toils disappointments failures struggles it doesn't come on a silver platter it is not a gift it is a virtue you have to fight for it if character good behavior attitude if it is the only thing we are going to carry when we take our last breath then it tells us how important it is we can never overemphasize that that Christ himself God in human flesh he had to learn what obedience by the things he suffered by the things he suffered you want to you want to see true character there was never anybody so humble like the Lord Jesus never there was never anyone all power in heaven and on Earth was given him he had the power and the authority to call leges of angels to come and fight on his behalf and such a man was set and they will say all manner of things about him and all he will just do is just look with all the power and the authority he had that they did all that they did against him called him names whipped him hang him on the cross n him to the cross and yet he wouldn't call the angels to war that is true humility that is true character and it is an example for you and me a lot of the times we don't even go through anything and all we do is complain for everything that comes our way we may not like it you don't have to like it but when God allows situations to come your way it's for a good you may not see it at that present time but there is something good behind it how else else do you shine the light in you if there is no Darkness around you there is light in you to shine the Bible says let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and give the glory to your father which is in heaven if there is no Darkness for you to shine that lights how do you shine how do you glorify God when God allows situations is just to bring that which is inside of you out sometimes you don't even know what you are capable of by the grace of God but it happens that in that spare in in that time in the spare of the moment you just see Christ play out that when you sit to think about it I mean sometimes you even have to because you know yourself and you know when God has taken over the you know it is not you you know it is the grace of God praise the lord we are getting somewh so we are talking about character talking about attitude it is not your character the bride you choose reflects your character and the bride Christ has chosen must reflect his character we are talking about the life of God in a man we are talking about the character of Christ in a man we all have our nature if you are not happy with your attitude you don't have to keep it you don't have to manage it you can trade it you can trade it tonight so everything is edly but by now we have realized that attitude actually transcends Beyond time that when all of life comes to an end and a man has to live he is going to carry character with him praise the Lord brother Bram said that the right mental attitude to every Divine promise of God would bring it to pass so your attitude is enough to bring you your healing if you can believe your attitude can change a whole picture look at Virgin Mary when he was overshadowed by the the Holy Spirit what her attitude was praise the Lord and we can also talk about a um San uh woman in Matthew 15:27 whose daughter was vexed with an evil spirit when he was behind the Lord Jesus and he she was sh shouting thou son of David have mercy upon me me thou son of David have mercy upon me just following them and just crying out my daughter is vest with an evil spirit she cried and cried and followed them till the disciples couldn't bear it anymore it was enough for the woman to have told herself I have shouted enough he is not even minding me let me just forget it she can die if she wants to die but she didn't stop she kept following and she was she shouting and shouting and shouting thou son of David have mercy upon me till the disciples told the Lord Jesus why don't you send this woman away why don't you send her away she is just tormenting us and when she turned to the woman she said I cannot give the children meet to dogs still the woman was not offended she said yes as a fact you can't do that but you cannot also deny the dogs from eating of the crabs she said what what a faith what was it that was her attitude towards God her attitude towards God was what brought her the result her daughter got healed why because of her attitude attitude matters is so important and let us not forget that in our service to God attitude is everything praise the lord we got can talk about the Centurion whose servant was so sick and when he heard that the Lord Jesus had entered capern with his with with his disciples he came and as that Jesus goes with him to go and heal his servant he actually asked for the healing of his servant and the Lord Jesus said yes I will come and look at another attitude here that you don't have to come I have a man set in Authority I tell this go and they go I tell this come and they come just speak the word and my servant will be healed praise the Lord he said I have not seen such a such great a faith in Israel I have not seen it what an attitude towards the word of God if you should have have such an attitude towards every single promise of God you are going to see it come to pass in your life the right mental attitude towards every Divine promise of God would bring it to pass a lot of the times we don't have that right mental attitude sometimes we think we do a lot of times we don't and if you have the right mental attitude and you talk to God and you are not seeing the result just stay there it's only for a while do not let your faith waver it will surely come to pass praise the Lord the right mental attitude towards every promise of God would surely bring it to pass can we take to Luke 10 to Luke 18 that will be our last reading for tonight Luke 18 Luke 189 Luke 189 and his SP this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they are righteous and despised others now some of the times we find ourselves here that we say to ourselves oh we are the bride of Christ we have believed in the message of our day we have believed in M 4 5 and6 we are the redeemed of the Lord and we are ready for a Rapture and then we look at all other people as trash we look down on everything because they are not your brothers because they are not your sisters because they don't fellowship with you because they don't believe in what you believe or stand for what you stand and because of that they are going to hell we show no mercy we show no mercy the Bible says that let he that thinketh he standed he that thinks he standed let him take heed lest he falls show Grace show Mercy it is the grace of God that has brought us this far it is not our strength there are children of God out there you can't just look at somebody on the for on the forehead and tell who they are sometimes we look at people by the way they they dress and the places they go and we think that no the Judgment of God should just come and consume them if God did that to us a lot of us will not be here in this room because God were those days that we go to the nightclubs in the drinking power drink from night from morning till night get up in the morning in instead of brushing our teeth we use drink to brush our teeth if God had not had mercy upon us we would not be here it is the grace of God it is not our strength and he spake this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others praise the Lord two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as the other men are extortionist unjust adulterers and even as this Publican I fast twice in the week I give TI of all I all that I possess and the Publican standing a far of would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smut upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner tell I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the order for everyone that exalted himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted praise the Lord two men stood side by side one just taught himself to be so righteous and he looked down upon the other so so much that he's in his prayer he was saying I am not an extortioner I don't steal I don't corent I don't commit adultery I don't cheat I don't drink I don't smoke like this Publican here I am a righteous man I pay TI the biggest TI and you should hear my prayer but here on the other side was a Publican who would not even speak out but in humility was pray and crying out to God Lord have mercy have mercy forgive me a sinner have mercy forgive me my shortcomings have mercy forgive me for letting you down have mercy that when you trusted in me to lift the bloodstain B of Christ for the world to see I let you down I sanded that opportunity forgive me oh just praying pleading for the mercies of God the Lord Jesus said this publicly went home more Justified than the what again attitude in this attitude in this so attitude matters a lot in our life's journey at work you can be the best employee if you don't have the right attitude they will walk you through the doors I have seen people say oh I am the best employee without me this company would not function they walked them through the door and the company has been bar atude spiritually if you are going to go anywhere with Christ your attitude towards the word of God is crucial your attitude towards the word of God is crucial what is your attitude when the word of God comes to you and then it is not what you wanted to hear that the word of God comes to you and you feel like a sword has been dashed through your soul you feel like you are under the gun you feel like the sermon is so much against you you feel like oh this is I'm the one they are talking about what is your attitude when the word of God is preached what is your attitude your attitude towards the word of God can bring God closer and it can send you far away from so remember that our attitude towards the K of God are very important our attitude towards the word of God is crucial very important if we are going to go anywhere at all with Christ Our attitude towards his word is very very very important and remember that good attitude character for that matter it's one thing that all of us are going to carry with us when life is no more when we have stepped out of this body and are gone our attitude goes with us your character goes with you character is almost like your DNA and it takes circumstances to bring out that attitude it takes circumstances to bring out the true you your character that is hidden and nobody sees it it takes circumstances to bring it out if circumstances around your life do not bring it out time will bring it out you can't hide it you can't hide it whatever it is you can look at your life and you see where you're not doing well it's a good thing when you can look in the mirror of the word of God and see where you are falling short praise the Lord then it gives you something to pray about it gives you something to pray about when I looked at that that attitude actually as up to 100 when nothing else does it blessed my heart and I just thought I should share something like this tonight it may not have maybe it was not what you wanted to hear but probably there is somebody here who needed that praise the Lord so remember that in our walk with God God actually demands it attitude towards your attitude towards the word of God is very important to it may not mean anything to you but it means a lot to you and we are here to serve God and whatever means a lot to him should be something that we should be Desiring to do praise the Lord life is not about us it's about him and whatever matters to him should matter most to Us Praise the Lord so remember as we leave here tonight that your attitude towards the word matters a lot to God and your attitude would open every single door in this life whether it is spiritual whether it is social whether it is economic whatever it is your attitude good attitude for that matter would open that door and then lift you up and bring you where you never expected to be praise the Lord one Lord let's put There song We sang last Wednesday the same God let's sing the the chorus and uh we want to thank the Lord for that tonight that word of encouragement exaltation reminding us uh Solomon said this in Ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse one he says keep thy fa when thou goeth to the house of God and be more ready to year than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil praise the Lord be not rash with thy mouth and let not the heart be histed to alter anything before God for God is in heaven and thou are upon the Earth therefore let thy words be filled praise the Lord so we just want to thank thank the Lord for that exhortation tonight um let's sing that chus together [Music] let's stand on our feet tonight he's the same God who living in me yes the same God

world the same God who wondrous to many to tell the same God who parted the Raging resing he is the S who living in me let's just bow our heads together tonight brother brother Dan speaking tonight on um on attitude character but Rand said there in U Ephesian paralite Joshua how our misbehavior of unconfessed sin how he can cause the church to fail all goes back to our attitude and Especial the the last scripture he read there you see saints of God we have to realize that the message of the hour is a high calling God has called us to a high calling in the way we talk the way we dress and many times uh we stay on the atmosphere of this word it affect us change the way we do things but we have to come to that reality you know when brother B talks about the right mental attitude it's not the way you compose your mind but the way you receive the word the way you think about God's word many times we we we think about how the grace of God is helping us in our life and sometime it's so easy for us to attribute it to our effort to our the effort we put in In Living right the effort we put in in holding the word our you know you know our faithfulness and but we have to realize that it's the grace of God we always have to bring it back to the foot of the cross that it is by God's grace it's by God's grace that we are standing in in his house tonight it's by God grace that is giving us uh uh the strength and uh the wisdom and everything that we doing we we have to bring it back to him it is it is he that is working in us mightily we must now one day rely on our own effort not our own best attitude because I'm telling you people there are people that are that that that grow up with respect and and morals and and and but when it comes to the attitude towards the word Jesus told John the Baptist disciples and said go tell John blessed is he that is not offended in me [Music] I own eyes to be like him let's sing it together before we pray now to be like Jesus to be like Jesus
