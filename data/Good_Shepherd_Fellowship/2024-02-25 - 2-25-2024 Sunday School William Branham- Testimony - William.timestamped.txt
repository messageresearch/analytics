[0:00] and then finally at the hospital when
[0:03] the doctors was operated and giving no
[0:06] hope or not much hope of ever seen come
[0:09] through again then when he was at the
[0:13] end of his road then father's gra at
[0:18] him and the glory of the Lord came down
[0:21] on him in the room and he was just said
[0:23] just F in God's
[0:26] Beauty and when love has been
[0:31] projected then it's time for a Sovereign
[0:34] Grace to step in it'll do it every
[0:38] time you look the strange thing of how
[0:41] we human beings like to do things
[0:44] ourselves but we are children of God and
[0:47] many times we have to just take a seat
[0:49] and sit down till God comes around does
[0:51] it his
[0:53] way
[0:55] and notice a little child I was just
[0:58] sitting back there a few moments ago
[0:59] talking talking to a very fine medical
[1:01] doctor from Chicago who I had the
[1:04] privilege of having breakfast with this
[1:07] morning and we were speaking and he
[1:10] perhaps he knows this I'm sure does many
[1:13] times you have a little child and he
[1:15] gets on a little uh Timber tantrum we
[1:19] call it our home oh he's just sticking
[1:22] and squealing and going on he's go to
[1:24] tear up everything and go to hold his
[1:26] bread and usually a mother will come and
[1:28] shakeing and throw him up in the air and
[1:30] try to get him get his best I don't
[1:32] think this the case in history for
[1:34] whatever remember
[1:36] died he just has to run to the end of
[1:39] his road and then nature takes
[1:43] over that's the way with us Christians
[1:45] sometime we just have to run to the end
[1:47] of the road and let Grace take over we
[1:49] have to run all our theology out so God
[1:52] can really get the
[1:53] work you believe
[1:57] that
[1:58] and God does work in mysterious ways his
[2:02] wonders to
[2:03] perform now I've noticed this that each
[2:06] one of us as Sons and Daughters of God
[2:10] many times I have thought of
[2:12] Pentecost where said they were all in
[2:15] one place and one
[2:18] Accord now where there's Unity that was
[2:22] power and then if we only knew that each
[2:27] one of us in a um amateur way is a
[2:33] Creator uh we are sure that you
[2:36] understand that you see the little
[2:39] success that the Lord has given me as
[2:41] I'm to testifying this morning of
[2:45] success is because of this one thing
[2:49] that the patients that I'm praying for
[2:51] in the sick line I have to enter into
[2:55] their Fellowship of suffering with
[2:58] them and th reason I can't have a parine
[3:01] where you just run through like a bunch
[3:03] of sheep coming to a yard you've got to
[3:08] feel the the need of that individual
[3:12] standing before you if you don't you
[3:14] can't have the feeling of it like Paul
[3:17] rer once said said he was going to work
[3:20] one morning so he in his life had a
[3:24] little well of disagreement and he said
[3:27] as he started out he kiss his wife said
[3:30] bye she was crying but he always walked
[3:32] out the the G turned back and said bye
[3:35] she say goodbye so that morning when the
[3:37] same routine PassTime he said goodbye
[3:40] and she said goodbye said he went out
[3:42] the street and begin to think what if
[3:44] something would happened to me today or
[3:46] something happened to her that I know we
[3:48] never meet again in this
[3:49] Earth You got the thinking about it and
[3:52] said God begin to deal with you you ran
[3:55] back to the house real quick jerk open
[3:57] the door just standing behind the door
[3:58] still weeping said he never said one
[4:01] word to her but just pulled her around
[4:03] and kissed her again turn that back
[4:05] around went out went to gate turn back
[4:07] said goodbye but she said goodbye like
[4:10] she said the the difference was the last
[4:13] time there was a feeling
[4:18] in so that's the way it is there got to
[4:22] be a
[4:24] feeling there's got to be something that
[4:28] that's projected from you to meet the
[4:31] person you're talking to you meet the
[4:34] girl down in
[4:37] Mexico we were talking down there and on
[4:41] the platform there was an old man came
[4:43] to the platform who was Dr I looked down
[4:46] his old wrinkled seat and they were
[4:48] probably never had a pair of shoes dust
[4:50] all over the poor old man and he want to
[4:53] kneel down and take out his Rosary for
[4:55] prayer be and watch the sa raise him up
[4:59] and to this I said no need of doing that
[5:02] but when he put his arms around
[5:06] Bri I thought you know and my daddy
[5:10] would live just been about his age and
[5:13] here I am with a pair of shoes on I look
[5:15] down and it wasn't fit him or I to give
[5:17] him a
[5:18] Sho but to feel that whole man so de
[5:25] cry and then after all was that never
[5:30] maybe a good meal no clothes Harry to
[5:33] wear maybe life that had a lot of
[5:35] burdens but only a a man of like you
[5:40] would know then to be shut off and
[5:44] darkness where he couldn't see something
[5:47] inside him begin to bleed oh God that
[5:50] poor mortal a man like I am as a healing
[5:55] he loves eats drinks lives he a man
[6:00] and he's in this condition while praying
[6:03] for him put arms around him his old
[6:06] hands rain across my shoulder P I said
[6:09] heavenly father if this would make me
[6:12] feel to him like that what does it do to
[6:15] you in a few moments I heard him
[6:17] screaming and going on he receive
[6:21] his now what it is is
[6:26] love
[6:28] love
[7:28] e
[8:34] I I took a hold of her
[8:37] hand and he knelt down and his old patch
[8:42] shirt faded out and as I prayed just a
[8:46] little prayer I thought I seen the
[8:50] wrinkles in her forehead kind of
[8:54] frown Satan said to me of course you
[8:57] know that's just the real action of the
[9:00] muscles she's
[9:04] dead but as a continued to pray her hand
[9:08] gripped mine like that and Satan said
[9:12] again it's just the
[9:15] muscles but I just kept on
[9:19] praying in a few moments she raised
[9:23] up and she said who are
[9:26] you and her old husband so overcome by
[9:30] the bringing of life again to his sweet
[9:33] wife he threw his arms around her and
[9:35] begin to scream
[9:37] mother I slipped out the door of the
[9:40] ambulance and I said can you get me back
[9:43] to the platform
[9:46] and the man said there's 2,000 people
[9:49] between here and the
[9:50] door he said I'll take you around in the
[9:54] back of the parking lot and see if I can
[9:56] make the way in
[10:00] and just to show
[10:02] that God will respect those who hunger
[10:06] and thirst for
[10:11] righteousness when we got to where the
[10:13] line of the chartered buses
[10:17] was I heard a noise and I looked and it
[10:21] was a young colored girl nicely dressed
[10:26] in Arkansas in those days had strict
[10:30] segregation and she was
[10:33] blind and she was trying to find her way
[10:36] around calling for her
[10:40] papa I noticed her because she was kind
[10:43] of tall and she was saying oh papa where
[10:48] are
[10:50] you and feeling with her hands and
[10:52] saying won't somebody help me to find my
[10:58] papa
[10:59] well I Stood Still no one knew me
[11:02] because I'd just been in the temple all
[11:05] the time and they couldn't get near the
[11:07] place so I just stood there just a
[11:11] moment and I looked at her and she said
[11:17] somebody please help me find my
[11:22] papa nobody seemed to pay any attention
[11:25] to
[11:26] her and I was standing still watching
[11:29] her she come moving through the
[11:34] crowd not thought of old blind Anna in
[11:38] the
[11:38] temple that when she had prayed so
[11:43] long and waited for the consolation of
[11:46] Israel and when they brought our Lord
[11:49] into the temple to do for him after the
[11:51] custom of the law the Holy Spirit Led
[11:55] her through that crowd her being blind
[11:58] up to where he was
[12:00] was and I Stood Still and the young
[12:04] woman come moving on up and finally she
[12:07] staggered right into
[12:09] me she said pardon me and she started
[12:14] again and I said who are you looking for
[12:17] young lady she said sir I'm looking for
[12:21] my
[12:23] papa she said I we come over here from
[12:27] Memphis to see the
[12:31] Healer and said my papa was trying to
[12:35] find a way for me to get
[12:38] in and he told me to stand
[12:42] still but they pushed me out of the
[12:45] place and I've lost where I was standing
[12:48] and I'm blind and I can't find my way
[12:52] back would you be so kind she said to
[12:56] help me to the bus for my papa can find
[13:01] me now this seems like being a
[13:05] hypocrite but I said what did you say
[13:09] you come over here to see she said I
[13:12] come over to see the
[13:17] Healer she said you see sir I've been
[13:20] blind for
[13:23] years and she said I heard on the radio
[13:27] this morning
[13:29] of a man who got his
[13:32] sight and said Papa got the money ready
[13:36] and we got on the chartered bus and I
[13:40] come over to see him and now they say
[13:43] you can't even get near the
[13:46] building I said you don't believe in
[13:49] such stuff as that do
[13:52] you I said in the days when we've got
[13:55] such fine doctors she said but what you
[13:59] see sir they can't do me no
[14:04] good and I said you mean to tell me that
[14:07] you believe that the prayer of that man
[14:10] would do something for me or for
[14:13] you and she said like this I'll never
[14:17] forget
[14:18] it she said I'll tell you what I'll
[14:22] do if you'll just help me in where that
[14:25] man is then I'll find my papa
[14:33] what a rebuke to
[14:37] me I thought of blind Fanny
[14:41] Crosby she had heard of this other man
[14:44] being
[14:45] healed the other blind
[14:48] person and I thought of finy Crosby when
[14:51] she wrote pass me not oh gentle
[14:56] savior hear my humble will cry while on
[15:01] others Thou Art calling do not pass me
[15:06] by thou the stream of all my
[15:10] comfort more than life to me whom have I
[15:15] on Earth beside thee or whom in heaven
[15:18] but
[15:21] thee while God is healing an angel's
[15:25] Temple he can heal in this Upper Room
[15:28] amen
[15:30] he's a God who healed that man on that
[15:32] wheelchair last night brought that with
[15:35] cancer off of the cop to rejoice when he
[15:37] couldn't even
[15:40] move the one who healed Little
[15:43] Ricky the one who sent the message all
[15:47] the way across the
[15:49] sea and spoke to that woman dying with
[15:52] diabetus and here sets her sister here
[15:54] this morning call back he's the same God
[15:57] now amen amen
[16:01] and I looked at her and I said to
[16:05] her I maybe I'm the one you're supposed
[16:08] to see see how God Lots things just
[16:11] exactly right why was I taken to the
[16:15] back she grabbed me by the lapels in my
[16:18] coat like that and she said are you the
[16:23] Healer I said no sister I am
[16:27] not I'm just your
[16:31] brother she said I want to see the
[16:34] Healer and I said I hope that you see
[16:37] him someday and I believe you
[16:40] will she said what is your name I said
[16:44] brother brandom she said you the one I
[16:47] want to
[16:48] see and I said now no one knows me I'll
[16:52] pray for you but don't let it be
[16:55] known take your hand and I couldn't pull
[16:58] her hand hand off of my
[17:01] lapel she was holding on for dear
[17:05] life
[17:09] Hallelujah and I said to her I can pray
[17:12] if you'll believe she said that's all I
[17:15] asked you to
[17:18] do and we bowed our heads and while we
[17:22] were praying I heard a
[17:25] scream and she ran out into the L
[17:28] throwing people one way or the other and
[17:31] she fell on the ground screaming I who
[17:33] was once blind can now
[17:37] see a few weeks ago I got a letter from
[17:41] her oh her eyes are
[17:44] 2020 she don't even have to wear glasses
[17:47] or
[17:48] nothing it's amazing grace of God that
[17:52] does these
[17:54] things it's something that Jesus Christ
[17:57] gave to his Church to enjoy the
[18:00] Privileges of good
[18:03] health I remember that night as we
[18:05] closed I might say
[18:08] this when the Lord give the ministry to
[18:11] me to go pray for his
[18:14] children as you all know I've been
[18:16] brought up in a poor home and that's the
[18:20] reason I'm uneducated and can't speak
[18:23] and so forth but I ask the Lord I don't
[18:27] want to be
[18:28] great I don't want to be
[18:31] popular I just want to be honest that's
[18:35] all I
[18:37] desire that you can know that I telling
[18:41] the truth because I represent
[18:46] him
[18:48] and when I started on the field to pray
[18:51] for the sick I I didn't have a suit to
[18:55] put
[18:57] on and I never taken an offering yet in
[19:00] my
[19:01] life and my brother CER boy at that time
[19:06] had been in an automobile accident and
[19:08] had cut his clothes all up and he gave
[19:12] me that old
[19:14] suit and uh trousers were torn pretty
[19:18] well
[19:19] and my wife went down to the 10 cent
[19:22] store and got some of them patches you
[19:24] iron on with the iron you know and she'd
[19:27] fixed up the trousers pretty well and
[19:30] the pocket was torn out and I got me a
[19:34] needle and thread and kind of whipped
[19:36] the pocket over you know patched it up
[19:40] sewed it and I'm not very good with the
[19:44] needle and I remember when they would
[19:47] introduce me to ministers such as we
[19:49] have here this
[19:51] morning I was kind of ashamed of the
[19:54] coat it is on the right side and that's
[19:57] I had to reach my right hand so I hold
[20:00] my hand sleeve down over that Tor and
[20:03] pocket and reach out my left hand to
[20:06] shake hands with the ministers and
[20:07] saying excuse my left hand but it's
[20:10] closer to my
[20:12] heart
[20:13] but the thing was that I was ashamed of
[20:18] that old torn
[20:21] pocket but when those people saw that
[20:26] young Ethiopian girl with her
[20:30] sight there stood an old man there with
[20:33] a club in a Twisted
[20:36] foot he said I know who you are brother
[20:40] brandham I've been standing here three
[20:43] days in this
[20:46] rain if you just ask God God will heal
[20:50] my
[20:52] foot what can be done at that
[20:57] time I said to him my brother if you
[21:01] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[21:04] the third day to make all these things
[21:07] possible hand me your
[21:11] club and when he handed the club he
[21:13] wasn't just kidding he meant
[21:17] it and I seen with my own two eyes that
[21:22] Twisted club foot come straight and he
[21:25] jumped into the air and begin to scream
[21:31] four men rushed around me but people
[21:34] mothers with their little babies trying
[21:37] to get in close to
[21:40] enough just to touch that old ragged
[21:43] coat and God was healing them it wasn't
[21:48] the Ragged goat no it wasn't the one
[21:51] that was wearing
[21:53] it it was the Lord Jesus that's here
[21:57] this morning hallah honoring their
[22:03] faith he leads us in mysterious
[22:06] ways because he loves us he makes it so
[22:11] simple until it goes over the head of
[22:14] the wise and prudent as he said it would
[22:18] and shall reveal himself to babes such
[22:21] as will
[22:23] learn I am sensitive enough of the Holy
[22:27] Spirit it to know now that there's many
[22:30] people that are suffering right here in
[22:32] this
[22:34] building and why not us just settle it
[22:37] now and accept what Jesus did for you
[22:41] all the same God was out there that
[22:45] night is the same God that's here right
[22:48] now and you have the same needs that
[22:52] they
[22:52] had and he is no respector of
[22:56] person
[22:58] the scriptures are
[23:00] true these things are done that it might
[23:03] vindicate that we're living in the last
[23:06] days in the shadow of the coming of the
[23:10] Lord as one speaker just said a while
[23:14] ago and being called in to the president
[23:18] to the cabinet and so forth to ask the
[23:23] question what can be done there's
[23:26] nothing can be done done just get ready
[23:30] to meet the
[23:31] Lord we have sinned away our day of
[23:35] Grace and there's only one thing left
[23:38] and that's the coming of the
[23:41] Lord and these signs and wonders that
[23:44] you see taking
[23:46] place
[23:56] are
