the first lane went to the second lane went to the ted and in less than five seconds the car just shot in the air in fact it just flew going to the wall in the middle so i just turned the steering on the other side and i shouted jesus and i just held on to it it got so close to the wall and then it went off on the other side i thought it was going to topple over and then came back and then went on the other side and it just got three four feet to a ditch and then stopped right there so right there and then the thoughts just came back so that was why you wanted to call him i almost got caught up and i remembered on wednesday we talked about as i was with moses so will i be with you and we said the lord the pillar of fire is still in the camp i said satan you are telling lies the lord our god is with us in fact i just want to give god the glory um and one thing happened i never got sometimes i'll be driving behind somebody and something happens and i get scared for them i miss my heartbeat

the house of the lord this morning amen praise the lord it's good to come see you coming with your shouting shoes on glenn it's good to see you and see your family praise the lord we greet you all in the name of the lord jesus well welcome praise the lord and glenn being down and not feeling well the uh dealing with the virus but the grace of god has helped him and brought him through it and we were talking and he remembered uh uh god's way special somebody prayed for me so we have to do that special this morning amen we're going to call that god's way special some people when we say gospel is special you know what we're talking about amen let's stand on our feet amen and let's do a little bit of that praise the lord amen [Music] oh yes [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh oh yeah [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] thank you [Music] oh [Music] thank you jesus praise the lord the lord bless you you can have your seat amen amen amen amen praise the lord it's good to be in the house of the lord amen we are very grateful for that we have a few prayer requests here we we send send some of these back there to the sign room to put it on our prayer request list we'll have a prayer request list of uh needs that we want to be praying for and so there's a brother one of the ministers there in d.c with our dear brother mira i want to be with the lord brother joel he lost his dad he's one of one of the others there went to be with the lord and how to privilege to speak with him yesterday he will be laying his father to rest this coming weekend and we he asks that we pray for his mom and so we want to continue to remember that and we want to pray for our good friend and the other pastor martins and anura that's brother mirren's dad it had now been very easy for pastor martins since his son went to be with the lord that's his only child and that was his best friend and martin was sick very sick and then when he came out of it he told his son that uh i would like you to preach my funeral if i should die but it please the lord to take the sun before the death so you can just put all of that together and see what he's dealing with so he's not been very well we want to continuously remember him in our prayer i spoke with brother timothy yesterday from ghana he sent his greetings i was trying to check with him because he should be able to know more details with that and also with my friend brother dele he's on his way to ghana for some meetings with some of my good friend there interim and i just felt like traveling by talks amen amen and now we want to also remember brother tony over in atlanta that's one of the local pastor there he lost his mom over in ghana so he asked that we keep the family in prayer actually sister eunice told me this morning and so i had to have to get to him after service here or sometime in a week he's uh hoping to travel home to lay his mom to rest and now so we want to keep those things in in prayer uh sister eunice and called that the net they were trying to get their car started so i think that's the reason why they couldn't make the service but the acts that we keep them in prayer she and becky and the rest of the girls they're from a kid uso who just uh keep them in our prayers brother lawrence and his family want to thank god for the safe delivery of the grandchild little joseph and give breath so they are thanking god for all your prayers that josephine had a safe delivery and with all the concern of the doctors the law was able to bring her through safely so we thank god for for her life and the life of the baby praise the lord and just like it was announced we try to get a number for the church because when we come in the other day comes try to switch their phone off and everything so it's just an emergency number you call it 7 7 am monday morning nobody will be here to answer your call it just it's just an emergency number during service time if there is any form of an emergency you know that is that is henry on the road maybe in an accident you might need some help just call that numbers that they can't respond to it back there and then we can be able to be lifting you up in prayer if there's a need to be able to send someone out to to give you a hand we will definitely do that people do uh try to call but all the phones are shut off you know i myself i do it you know i try to call them and i can't get anybody so i send an email back there i see if they see it they will get brother jordan for me so uh so we get a number there then and so it's a church number just for for emergency and uh as we said it's uh we feel good to be in the house of the lord and uh i wanna photos to try this song we sank it before the same god that spoke to the woman at the well that same god is living in me and we have not been doing well i know one of the persons that have helped us over the years is brother lloyd i mean when we introduce a new song we go over and over here and then it sticks you know we sing a song one time and we don't come back until three years so when we put it back up it looks like a brand new song amen amen so let's let's let's try to sing that and worship the lord and then we can go right in the word this morning amen let's try the stencil i will try if i fail if i go too flat then we'll do it another time amen praise the lord i look back [Music] on history see the mighty god on there proving over and over that his word can never fail but i can't keep on dwelling on some past memory cause he's the same god who's living in the same god who spoke to the woman now the world the same guy who's one draws to many to dare oh the same [Music] is the same guy who's living hey let's do that for us one more time the same god [Music] the same guy was wondering [Music] let's do that chorus one more time oh let's turn up the same guy who spoke [Music] oh the same [Music] he's [Music] do a little more practice on that maybe wednesday night the lord bless you thank you musicians let's take our bibles praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord i thought since we got the the chorus to a good place let's just leave it just like that and praise the lord before i drag you down the mountain this morning amen praise the lord isaiah chapter 57 but i was thinking about that song yesterday while i was here studying and then i look into one of the hymnbooks we have back there and and started singing and going over the words but the reason why i was thinking about it is is the reality that he's the same god that is living in us amen he's the same god today the god that we're going to read off from this bible is the same one today praise the lord and the good news is he's in our midst the more better news is he's living in you because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the word that's right praise the lord and uh and and and we have to learn to appreciate that we have to cherish it it has to become more real than just a good religious talk isaiah chapter 57 let's read verse 15 and 16 for our scripture reading isaiah chapter 57 praise the lord isaiah chapter 57 reading verse 15 for those said the high and lofty one that inhabited eternity praise the lord whose name is holy adored in the high and holy place with him now listen to this now adwords in a high and holy place with him dead with him also that is all for country and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the country one for i will not content forever neither will i be always rough for the spirit should fail before me and the souls wish i have made let's pray together heavenly father we will ask your blessings upon your the portion of your word that we have read and father so we just asked the lord you will come out of the pages of the bible father lord speak to us this morning the lord god we can know the same one that wrote these words is the same one that is dealing with our hearts it's the same one that is healing our body is the same one that is changing our lives father we thank you we appreciate you thank you father for the testimony in the camp and and everything that your grace and love is doing in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you can have your seat now i tried praying thanking the lord for the testimony and something caught my mind you know brother dan was was giving his testimony and he's talking about i drive 18 and 85. you breaking the speed limit you're breaking this feeling you know brother dan used to be a correctional officer oh my goodness so he's always running after people i'm sitting down there and say this guy you should see the merchant of god and stop speeding praise the lord and it also goes to many of us that speed i'm seeing you on the mine eyebrows praise the lord you know he called me and we were talking about it and he was telling me i was just shaking my head i was just shaking my head and says lord jesus i shall i said i wouldn't i wouldn't have made statement on it but because he came on the pooping not confessing and saying church your please pray for me let god deliver me from speeding this morning i want to speak on the date of redemption the blinding of time and eternity i want to speak on the dead of redemption the blending of time and eternity i need the grace of god this morning amen we use all the time to sink and just at a time what i should be closing is the time i'm beginning to preach so i will try not to hold you alone but i want to bring some few things this morning from the book of revelation addressing our time addressing the age that we are living in and talking on some things that are very dear to us in this time that we are living you know just like uh uh we signed about the same god that's living in me it's almost like uh you know we believe that there is one god amen year old israel the lord our god is one praise the lord and yet we believe that that one god has manifested himself in in three offices and in many dispensation but this is something that that that haunts us even as believers we do that sometimes and um and it's this thing that we we believe it we in our soul we know that there is one god we know that uh he he deals with the the prophets and the father who he came down and was manifested as our lord jesus and he's in the dispensation of the holy ghost but now think about this when we talk when we when we think and and and desire a more closer walk with god and we say i want the holy ghost think about it now you say i want the holy ghost lord i want the holy ghost i want a refilling of the holy ghost there is there is always something in our mind that try to make us to think that the holy ghost is something different than the word of god amen in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god it took on flesh that's what the bible says but there is just something always in our mind when we say i want more of god i want a refilling of the holy ghost we try to take it to be something like god pouring down the bucket of water or a bucket of oil you know to fill our heart we try but all we are asking for is more of the word that all you are desiring all you are desiring is that the world must have a preeminence in your life i want more relationship with this word i want a closer word i want to see my name in a book i want to hear the word speaking back to me that's why you are desiring praise the lord now they're understanding that the the the refilling of the holy ghost the baptising of the holy ghost is that even the new birth is a birth of the word for because we are now born of incorruptible seed that's what the scripture says i'm a born of corruptable seed but we are born of incorruptible seed the word of god everything comes back to the word amen everything comes back to the word of god that's the reason why the word is the highest authority in the local church and the highest way that god can speak to you is from the word god still speaks by dreams he says peace by vision he still speaks by a fight for many straight and uh but the highest way he can speak to you all of those medium must come back to the world you can't take your dream above the word of god you can take what a motivational speaker said on the radio and say it makes sense above the word of god you cannot take anything above this word because this work is the origin of your existence are we together amen so think about that think about that don't let the devil to make you to feel like you need some kind of a right yeah you get another refilling you can get all the sensation if your body is not coming obedience to this word there's a problem somewhere praise the lord now let's take this as we study together the breach let's take this subject because we talked about the holy ghost here and ephesians chapter 4 verse 30. we want to take this from the bridge okay i think i'm in problem here i think i'm having a problem here and i know exactly what it is i'm not very sure that i share my my notes i don't mean to be selfish but uh now let's take this sorry if i didn't get my note out it would take a while for them to project what i'm reading so i don't know how the bible if you're putting down the scripture ephesians 4 30 said grief met the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed until the day of your redemption praise the lord grieve now the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption your redemption listen now hold that word redemption your redemption hold the word redemption see until the the day that the book of redemption has been revealed now we're talking about the day of redemption okay and and and and ephesians 4 30 says grieve now the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption now so he's trying to help us to to understand by scripture what is the day of redemption the day of redemption is here many hearts are failing for fear we sing that song now the day of redemption is until the book of redemption has been revealed that's one part of it amen and we know by scripture revelation 10 7 at the fulfillment of revelation 10 7 that's when the mystery of the book will be revealed are we are we together now so the book of redemption whole redemption until the day the book is it has been revealed and the redeemer come and clean his possession so it's two-faced when you talk about redemption you talk about the the the the deal of redemption now in the old testament it was almost like when a man uh uh uh when when a man a final wife he goes and pay the bribe price when he pay the back prize that's his wife he if he if he had done everything that the family required him to do that his wife is his wife but there is another face he has to come that's when the ceremony is is the time he comes and they are blessed and then he clean his wife so it's two face to one program amen so the day of redemption to the believer is when the book is revealed now we know prophetically is already revealed because the seals are open but to you as a believer is when god has given you an understanding praise the lord of what is written in the book that you are not a stranger to this god you are a son you are a daughter and you have always been a son you have always been a daughter when that is revealed to you is one portion of your redemption then there is another portion of your redemption which is the claiming are we together amen grieve that the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption hold the word redemption until the date of your redemption has been revealed the redeemer comes and claim his possession that's the second part see don't grieve it don't grieve it praise the lord don't grieve it i can i can put a lot of emphasis on that uh do things that please god for the book is sealed now and you are sealed the holy spirit itself is the seal praise the lord because it's a process a process of revealing the book that process continued to the time the book is clean are we together that's the reason why the apostle paul said don't grieve the holy ghost because you can you can you can have a revelation of what is in the book just like those songs of the prophet knew that elijah was going to be taken away they had an understanding that he would be taken away it never meant that they would have received the blessings of elijah they would have received the mentor of elijah that's the reason why the holy spirit warned us paul said don't grieve the holy ghost don't get to a place where you think you have arrived now you can do anything you want to do i have the holy ghost and you're not baptized in jesus name and in order that no don't grieve the holy ghost because it's a process it's a process i will take you through justification sanctification baptising of the holy ghost the the claiming of the book he says don't grieve it say do things that please god for the book is sealed now and you are sealed the holy ghost itself is the seal seal signifies the word there signifies a finished work and when the seventh seal is broken the mystery of god uh uh the mystery of god that seal in these mysteries sealed its finish until the day the seal is broken then it's revealed what is on the inside now so we are talking about the day of redemption because we are having this gap of when the revelation comes and the time of the claiming this gap that is between both the the the revelation and the claiming of the book this is the gap where time and eternity's blends are we together okay now we know that jesus and and the gospel taught us that you know believe in the lord jesus christ and you will have internal life it was not just a creed jesus was not giving the church a creed he was giving the church an idea of what god would do that while we are here on earth we will have a down payment while we are here on earth before we get to heaven we will have a portion of internal life we will have internal life in us we don't get to heaven before you get eternal life you get it here praise the lord so when does that happen there's a junction in the believer's life where he experienced that so that's what we call the date of redemption the blending of time and eternity let me give you give give us another uh example it's almost like a mother carrying a child that child that is in the womb is on earth amen do you believe that she's on earth or he's on earth while the child is in the warm praise the lord the child is on earth but yet the child is now fully on earth praise the lord because the child in a womb is is honor and atmosphere now science will tell you it is proving that while the child is in the womb if if you train a child to hear your voice from this side of earth they will hear your voice in the womb science prove it praise the lord if you keep if you keep talking you know talking to the child uh uh stop troubling mama now uh uh we're just waiting for your arrival and you keep talking and you keep talking and you keep talking that's what is i mean it's always uh uh uh uh being told uh you know of of uh uh uh that's there's a lady that told me that even uh from from from korea and uh uh one time we went into her shop you know and we were just talking you know talking some things and and she was expressing that you know how her little niece born and the child could pick to the english language quicker because the mother was always reading english books and she was reading it to the child she would take out this little storybook she'll be wrapping her tummy and she'll be reading it and when the child was born the child could pick up on the english language very faster praise the lord now so it's it's almost like that the reason why i'm saying that because it's it's the same place where the believers are this place where we call the blending of time and eternity is a womb praise the lord it's a womb we will get to that i will show you that in the scripture now so uh let's let's let's read a little bit here uh lifting him out of history we are standing tonight upon the brain and watching come to pass and unfolding two great sin and those two great sin are thieves one of them is the ending of history that's what we see happening before us i mean we are going to such a speed in the in the uh technology world praise the lord i mean with the gps and the google and and all of these such things it's even giving writers difficult time to write history because i mean you can use your gps and just google a setting area if you're having a google map and video you can even use that and see things that is happening there are we together we are this place a great scene one of them is the ending of history and the other one is the ending of time we are the aiming of history in the ending of time one of them is the ending of history the other day is the ending of time and many great men down through the ages has long to see this hour that we are that we are now approaching and as we live in this glorious setting of mortal sun and the breaking of internal light i do feel that we are living in one of the greatest age that that ever man has been permitted to live because it is the closing out of time and the blending in of eternity the closing of time and the blending in of eternity praise the lord i give you a very simple address i mean simple example when it gets to midnight it don't have to be midnight uh uh uh just changing from one hour to another praise the lord amen when it's changing from one hour it will almost be one o'clock i hope i can i stop when it's one o'clock but when it gets to that uh uh uh 59 minutes in the time of that one meeting i mean time don't stop us and say it's going to be one o'clock whatever you are doing you keep doing it is blended from one hour to another you you don't say that it does not work like it's it's it's 12 59 we all stick one o'clock don't work like that whatever you are doing you keep doing it and it just just run on and move on to time and oh my goodness the time has gone wow it was just oh my goodness it just blamed that's how it works through the ages even the church ages that's how it works there is blended from one to another praise the lord so the same with time and eternity there is not a full stop the world will come to an end where everything will get we our job is ticking waiting for the last meeting last night take over okay then god move us from a past it does not work there's a blending there's a blending of time a changing of dispensation praise the lord amen that how it works so we are living in this time is the greatest time of mortal life is the greatest time of mortal life the people of the world man i know what is happening but the believer knows it praise the lord i mean there's never a time we fed so close to the lord even though is is it's dark it's it's terrible fear on every hand praise the lord i mean if it is if it is not our our our household folks the one we live with i mean we we get around people that we love and we still take step back why because coronavirus had pledged our mind i mean people we used to live yeah and we just hit one another now we don't do that everybody stay their ground you know we are laughing and we stepping [Laughter] back it's a scary time i don't feel that we are living uh uh i do feel that we are living in uh uh in one of the greatest age that ever man has been permitted to live in because it's the closing of time in the blending of eternity history only tells us what we have read and what has been and what in the future lays in the hands of god praise the lord history tells us behind it goes to what is behind praise the lord amen is god what whatever it is in the future that is in the hands of god and we find out today that there is not too much history being reading because i don't think it will ever be used both of these great events are running into shadow waters that's the time that we are living in amen it's a time and that's the reason why even naturally scientifically it's hard to put a sense to what is happening it's hard to put a sense to what is happening because we are in we are in a blending time you know you you uh sisters you know what the blender does in the kitchen so praise the lord let's take this other blending timing in in eternity here we see this age that we are living in is one of the greatest age of all ages the laodicean church age is the greatest of all the church ages because is the ending of time and the blending of eternity and then is the greatest sinful age now you would think that because this is the blending of eternity the reality of internal life is hitting man's life there will be a great influence of holiness and righteousness you see that is the thing that is bringing contracts to the mind of the people how can we call this the greatest age how can we call this the day of redemption when there is just so much evil where is god that the whole world is plaque with coronavirus is that a god oh yeah there is god praise the lord you believe that you believe that there is a god i believe it i don't know what about you that he is the one i'm talking about i mean you just year horrible things on the news horrible things horrible things it's almost like man has lost your mind lost their mind a man will wipe out his whole family that child would take a gun and wipe out their whole family a young man deceived his parish over there in canada all every time he poured a backpack that came from bangladesh struggled their way over to to canada for better life he put a backpack lying to his parents that he's in school and is about to graduate when he's now one day in school and because it was graduation time they are waiting for his uh uh commencement paper to come he knew that he was not going to school took a gun wept the whole family to bury his shame this is the age where man is dealing with shame and they don't know how to deal with shame they don't know how to deal with shame they want to know how to get on facebook and and talk about other people problem and post about this one their own shame that they are that they have they don't know how to deal with it praise the lord i would do a parenthesis here the holy spirit helped me with a beautiful thing just few minutes before i came out of the office i'll share that with you i told you that i was thinking i'm preaching a message called dealing with shame and i was thinking about that as i was reading this you know in such an age that we are living in and and i thought about it i was looking in the scripture and i was thinking about looking how was shame dead with so i had this thing in my mind dealing with shame the fear of not being caught praise the lord kids don't want their parents to catch them doing what they know that they're not supposed to be doing we're always looking over our shoulders if there was not a concern we would not do that in one way or the other we are dealing with the fear that we don't want to be caught even in church we deal with that we deal with that but you know there's a beautiful thing that came out of the scripture for me this morning oh my goodness i almost shouted and jumped through my little window in the office there but i realized that the degree outside is so cold i will not survive it praise the lord now i was thinking about this in the house in john chapter four on my mind and since john chapter four was the woman at the well amen and this woman was dealing with so much shame half five husband the one she's living with she's not even sure if they will survive the next day and for the mother of fathers not even her husband she was dealing with so much shame that she could not rub arms with the girls she never had no friend that's what shame does it puts people into isolation she was so isolated that she had to wait for the evening when all the girls had gone from the well before she sneaked out to go and get some water and this shame was just killing her oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness and that that's the reason why we don't have uh uh uh i mean and people don't come out and get testimony the reason is because even when god delivered them because they were so ashamed of what they were dealing with they don't even want to testify they don't even want to testify that i was a mess i was into things that are not supposed to be in looking at filthy things on the internet they don't want to testify to that why because they are dealing with shame are we together now see what we're doing here we're talking about this place the dead of redemption the gap between the revelation the revealing of the book and the claiming of the book we are right in this gap that's what we're talking about but i have that little parenthesis here i want to get to something it was so beautiful you see that in in john chapter 4 this woman at the well saint john chapter 8 4 is the number of deliverance see john chapter 8 come with the woman that was caught in adultery praise the lord see john chapter 12 another four comes with the woman that came and used her hair to wash jesus feet i was sitting in the office i said what kind of a cold in the scripture because this book is not written intellectually this book is written by divine codes you can never pick it or because you are a student you have to pick it up because the holy ghost revealed it to you there is in john chapter 4 jesus dealing with a woman that is so embarrassed of her she that she's living a life of isolation saint john chapter 8 come jesus grabbed another woman that was caught in her shame now think about how he dealt with the shame of that woman in john chapter 4. because she was dealing with so much shame she had complex jesus said give me water to drink are you not a jews i'm a samaritan what do we have to do with one another the reason why she responded it was not because of the man or his nationality is because of what she's dealing with most of the time people respond because of your the side the thing you're dealing with inside that's what bring out your response [Applause] it's the complex trying to avoid him driving away quickly so you will not get to know some of the things that i mean almighty god amen the god of all patients i believe you were just there saying daughter i have come to deliver you from your shame [Music] and she was just acting up jesus says water you know i i have uh water that you would drink from me you never get tested are you greater than our father uh jacob jacob dug this way up all she was doing is just camouflage she's trying to hide herself realize now that he's a jewish man what she's trying to do hi herself behind religion i belong to this church i belong to this church jacob is our father you all say that in jerusalem that we have to worship she's now trying to take religion to cover her shame that's the age that we are living that's the age that we are living in people use church to cover their shame that's why we want a year what we want a year we want the church to be run by us we just have a prop a puppet on a pulpit play us this music then he press the button then you hit he play the music that you want and everybody thinks [Music] are we together but we know the story when jesus told her what she was dealing with he told her what she was dealing with he went down and got her out of her shin the way he could deliver her was to deal with the problem he never asked what message church you're coming from who was your pastor you know how long you been in the message that was not the question he went down to deal with her shame [Applause] praise the lord we know the story jesus went down and told her you have five husband the one you're living with not even your husband she broke free this woman that was so ashamed and embarrassed she broke free she's the one when running in the city she even forgot [Applause] she went running come and see the man that told me the things she was not afraid now to say the things that i have done [Applause] she was not a friend why because deliverance has come [Applause] and fall is the normal of deliverance amen saint john chapter 8 jesus they grabbed that woman in adultery trying to to to tempt him that's what the scripture says they're trying to tempt him and they grab the woman and throw her right down at his feet but you know the the error they make they make him the judge and be the judge it was in his right for him to be able to see the sentence that was the mistake they made they made him the george and as a george he got to the ground and he wrote her pattern he wrote her pattern oh rachel god oh my i always know when god comes in the chamber hey amen praise the lord my goodness and food is the number of deliverance amen i said george he wrote her pattern and he laid for his face i have already written it he with our stone sin cast the first stone you know what he was telling them you know your shame you know your shame you are dealing with you know your shame take your shame and come let me address it you already caught her in her chain you brought her to me bring your shame to me and let me address it oh praise the lord my my mind what are we talking about the day of redemption the gap between the claiming and the revealing of the book praise the lord oh my what are we talking about in john chapter 12 there comes another woman again oh my praise the lord saint john chapter 12 john just went in four and four and four my goodness just follow me now amen so john chapter 12 tells us about another woman right in the house of my goodness me how did this thing happen amen how did this thing happen the bible says in john chapter 12 then jesus sixth day sixth day you have to keep that in your mind sixth day you're having five the one you are with six he always comes in the seven that's the opening of the seals that's the revealing of god [Applause] sixth day before the passover came to bethany where lazarus was which has been dead amen there he met [Music] mary and the scripture says we know what the bible says here she fell down and she pulled that alabastro bus the alabaster oiled on him and she wept and she wept and judah said we should have sold this thing we were going to get some money for the church amen verse 7 then jesus said let the woman alone against the day of my burial has she kept this the poor you have always with you praise the lord but me you have not saint john chapter 16 another woman [Laughter] but that's the church there he's giving her the comforter yeah he spoke about their comforter saint john chapter 20 another woman that was at his resurrection praise the lord amen so after he deals with their shame he gave them a comforter and gave them a hope for a resurrection when god deals with your shame he replaces it with the comforter and it gives you a hope for the risen christ let's get back to revelation glory be to god let's close this parenthesis but that's the age that we are living in the loud issued age is the greatest of all ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of internet then is the greatest sinful age there's more sin in this age than there ever has ever been and the power of satan is many times harder to fight hey did you hear what i said yes did you hear what we just read the power of satan in this age is many times harder to fight then you just want to create easy christian life you just want an easy christian life and expect that everything will just go okay for you when the power of satan in this age is more harder to fight than it was in any ages he says year back there there in the early age of chris uh a christian uh uh called for the profession of being a christian of belonging to christ could be beheaded he could be killed and put out of ministry and go to meet god quickly but now the enemy has come in the name of the church he has come in the name of the church everybody is a christian that's right before being to take on the name of christ you have to seal your blood with your testimony oh yeah but now we belong to a church everybody is why because satan is the pastor he's the god of this evil age that's what paul says in the book of corinthian amen and now the enemy has come in the name of the church and is so deceiving this is a great age of deception christ says so the two spirit will be so close in the last days till it will deceive the very elite if possible and remember christ spoke of the illest people in the last saying if possible the people so lay people can people can live a clean life holy life not be sinful not idolaters not drinkers liars gamblers they can live above that and still met with it this is an age of life the personal life of christ that is the bridge that we are in this is the age of life it's just like that baby in the womb of the mother even though she's on earth but for her to falling breathe the the the breath or the air that is outside she has to be cut from the umbilical cord of the mother and that is the same way with the believer you have to be caught your umbilical cord that attach you to this world by your own birth has to be caught for you to come out of the womb this world and be birthed by mother jerusalem oh praise the lord praise the lord ah my my my we we are about to go down into deep waters praise the lord i don't know where is stopping you amen i have this thing all the way to my neck glory be to god are we together praise the lord musicians you can come musicians you can come i have a face of faith that if i start we will leave from here 3 p.m amen i will just stop with this parenthesis amen that's what the revealing of the world has come to do it has come to deal with our shame it has come to bring us out of the life of a shame that's why paul who said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ amen when paul said those things he was not even he was not even ashamed to say i crucified the church he was not ashamed to say i killed stephen why a man a woman that is delivered from shame is not afraid to testify because to know that it's not their doing it's what god has done it's what god has done and the more you talk about it jesus said if i be lifted up i will draw the more you lift him up the more he draws you closer the more you lift him up thank you lord for saving me thank you lord for delivering me thank you lord for cleansing me the more you left him up the more he draw you
