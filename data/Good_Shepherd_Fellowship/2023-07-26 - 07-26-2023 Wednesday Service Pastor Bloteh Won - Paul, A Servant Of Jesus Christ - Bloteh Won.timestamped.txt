[39:23] take it from our house tonight father
[39:25] and bless the service in Jesus name amen
[39:29] thank you musicians let's turn to the
[39:31] word
[39:31] [Music]
[39:34] foreign
[39:39] praise the Lord praise the Lord I
[39:40] realized on Sunday I was I was longer
[39:45] kind of a lengthy service that's a very
[39:49] good sign to tell you that I'm not a
[39:52] teacher amen
[39:54] teachers are very organized you know
[39:57] they are organized they are in their
[39:59] time
[40:00] I'm not a teacher so but uh
[40:04] what uh what what was guten in edifying
[40:09] is the other Monday uh
[40:12] a sister called meeting and she had a
[40:17] um
[40:18] she had a she had a dream
[40:21] and she was narrating that to meaning
[40:24] and
[40:26] in as much as
[40:29] uh some of the things she said in the
[40:32] dream was somehow pertaining to to herd
[40:36] and and some things that she's going
[40:39] through that the Lord is uh lifting her
[40:42] out of but it was more ministering to me
[40:45] because uh there were elements of the
[40:48] dream that related with the scripture
[40:51] that we read he gave his Angel spirit
[40:54] and his ministers flame of fire so that
[40:58] was very edifying to me and I felt like
[41:01] we were we were right right down there
[41:04] in
[41:05] in
[41:07] in the middle of the book
[41:09] praise the Lord
[41:11] in the middle of the book so let's let's
[41:13] read
[41:15] tonight the book of Isaiah chapter 52.
[41:19] Isaiah chapter 52 we will go a little
[41:24] step further tonight on Paul a seven of
[41:26] Jesus Christ
[41:28] um stay all in the midst of the same
[41:30] thing so
[41:31] I will go a little further tonight
[41:35] uh 47 of Jesus Christ
[41:39] so we
[41:43] Isaiah chapter 52 less we will read
[41:47] verse
[41:50] 13.
[41:56] as I have chapter 52 verse 13.
[42:01] uh
[42:05] let's let's first read 42 Isaiah 42
[42:08] before 52 as I have 42.
[42:15] Isaiah 42 we read uh
[42:19] first one
[42:25] Isaiah 42 verse 1 behold my seven womb
[42:30] are uphold
[42:31] my elect
[42:33] in whom my soul delighted
[42:37] I have put my spirit upon him
[42:40] he shall bring forth judgment
[42:44] to the Gentiles this judgment is not
[42:48] condemning judgment
[42:50] but it's a judgment of conviction
[42:53] praise the Lord amen is a judgment of
[42:56] conviction that this generation uh when
[43:00] you hear people don't judge me is just
[43:01] don't condemn me you know but uh
[43:04] judgment in the in the Bible who means
[43:07] instruction
[43:09] means conviction it could means uh uh
[43:13] leadership it also have the sense also
[43:16] of condemning but this judgment that he
[43:19] will bring to the Gentiles is a judgment
[43:23] of conviction
[43:25] I'll put my spirit upon him and he shall
[43:28] bring forth judgment to the Gentile he
[43:30] shall not cry nor let none lift up not
[43:34] cause his verse his voice to be heard in
[43:37] the street
[43:38] a Bruce Reed Shah he not break as
[43:42] smoking Flags Shaheen
[43:44] he shall bring forth joshmen unto truth
[43:49] praise the lord we know that uh uh this
[43:54] scripture was referred to our lord Jesus
[43:56] let's pray Heavenly Father we just want
[43:59] to pray tonight we want to talk about
[44:02] you the ministry of Jesus Christ we want
[44:05] to talk about you Lord God as the the
[44:09] the suffering servant Lord gather
[44:13] the purpose law of why you came down to
[44:18] serve us oh god father and that is the
[44:20] same thing that you have distributed to
[44:22] the body that we can be able to serve
[44:24] one another that's the purpose of the
[44:26] ministry is to self so Lord we just ask
[44:30] that God you will just minister to us
[44:32] tonight the different things that we
[44:34] wanted to look into we have a little
[44:37] more note than the time that we have
[44:38] tonight but we're just asking that you
[44:40] have your way in Jesus name amen praise
[44:44] the Lord the Lord bless you you may have
[44:45] your seed so you look at this that there
[44:49] are scripture
[44:50] Isaiah 42 and then when you go to Isaiah
[44:54] 52 verse 13 the Bible said behold my
[44:57] seventh
[44:58] Shadi prudently
[45:00] he shall be exalted in the stroll and be
[45:04] very high now you go also over to Isaiah
[45:08] chapter 53 the Bible says he he sh I see
[45:13] the travel of his souls and shall be
[45:17] satisfied 53 verse 11 by his knowledge
[45:21] of seven justify many so you look all
[45:25] through the Old Testament the Bible is
[45:27] prophesying of Jesus being a seven
[45:32] these verses that we read is talking
[45:34] about Jesus being a seven and uh the
[45:39] theologians call him Jehovah seven uh
[45:43] Jehovah 7. so is Jehovah becoming man to
[45:47] serve Us Praise the Lord you look also
[45:51] in Philippians chapter 2 Paul also said
[45:55] that uh verse 7 Philippians 2 7 but made
[46:02] himself of no repetition and talk upon
[46:05] him the form of a seven
[46:08] and was made in the likeness of man so
[46:12] God became man to serve us
[46:15] praise the Lord if you get that
[46:18] Revelation it must never be difficult to
[46:20] serve God
[46:22] he became men to serve us
[46:26] praise the Lord
[46:28] amen
[46:30] he became man to serve us
[46:32] and now we can gladly return service
[46:36] back to him
[46:38] praise the Lord
[46:40] amen we can gladly return service back
[46:43] to him and we can
[46:46] serve him the most when we serve one
[46:49] another
[46:51] praise the Lord
[46:53] we can serve him the most when we serve
[46:56] one another I mean God is Not
[46:58] much pleased in our in our service if we
[47:01] keep the church ordered you know then we
[47:04] keep the dress cold and uh and then you
[47:06] know we do all of those things and never
[47:09] serve one another
[47:12] praise the Lord
[47:13] we serve the Lord the most when we serve
[47:17] one another so that's why we want to
[47:18] look in tonight that's the reason why
[47:21] Paul called himself Paul
[47:24] the seven of Jesus Christ I don't know
[47:28] whether it was last Wednesday or the
[47:30] Wednesday before we we brought out the
[47:34] seven scriptures where Paul referred to
[47:37] himself as an Apostles Paul he greeted
[47:40] Paul the Apostles of Jesus Christ so
[47:43] two-year Romans chapter 1 verse 1 Paul
[47:48] greetings he says support as servant of
[47:51] Jesus Christ called to be an apostle
[47:55] praise the Lord that's what makes the
[47:57] ministry effective
[47:59] when you when you realize your duty
[48:03] the ministry is an office an apostle is
[48:07] an office
[48:08] the work of an apostle is a seven
[48:12] the pastor is an office
[48:15] the work of the pastor is a seven
[48:19] the Evangelist is an office
[48:22] the work of the Evangelist is a seven
[48:26] praise the Lord
[48:28] there are the the the the
[48:31] the the song and daughter of God is also
[48:34] your office
[48:37] but the work description of that office
[48:40] is a seven
[48:43] praise the Lord
[48:44] amen
[48:45] don't take that don't take the job by
[48:49] just looking at the title read the
[48:51] description
[48:53] read the work description
[48:56] praise the Lord amen
[49:00] you want to be a supervisor
[49:03] amen just to be a supervisor the
[49:07] description there is that if somebody
[49:08] don't show up you will work for them
[49:14] so find out what is the work description
[49:17] and don't don't be carried away with the
[49:20] title
[49:21] are we together
[49:23] praise the Lord
[49:25] that's one of the easiest way I could
[49:27] make myself understood tonight amen
[49:30] and so Paul says Paul as seven of Jesus
[49:34] Christ called to be
[49:38] an apostle separated onto the Gospel of
[49:41] Jesus Christ The Gospel of God tied uh
[49:44] uh Titus 1 verse 1 he also said the same
[49:49] thing Paul as seven of Jesus Christ and
[49:52] an apostle
[49:54] seven of God sorry and an apostle of
[49:58] Jesus Christ praise the Lord
[50:01] are we together
[50:03] amen so I wanted to establish that we're
[50:07] talking about Paul as seven of Jesus
[50:09] Christ tonight we we will go into into
[50:13] some few things so just just again to be
[50:16] able to back that up is the ministry of
[50:19] Jesus Christ so we see Jesus being
[50:22] prophesied in the Old Testament as as
[50:24] Jehovah 7 that is going to bring
[50:28] judgment on to the Gentiles so he's
[50:31] going to choose men that he will fulfill
[50:34] that
[50:35] he's going to call men he's going to
[50:38] call you and myself to be able to bring
[50:41] this judgment onto the Gentiles to be
[50:43] able to bring his word to be able to
[50:45] bring his righteousness or or his life
[50:48] unto the Gentiles so it's it's a state
[50:51] of fulfillment of the Old Testament uh
[50:54] prophecy of Jehovah 7 Jehovah becoming
[50:59] seven in Jesus he was able to find one
[51:03] man where the fullness of God do word in
[51:06] to be able to serve us bring us the
[51:09] ultimate
[51:10] service the death on the cross to settle
[51:14] the same question
[51:16] praise the Lord he did the big part
[51:20] we must now do the little part
[51:24] praise the Lord
[51:25] he paid the debts we must now tell all
[51:28] that your debt is paid
[51:30] you don't have no reason to live under
[51:33] that bondage
[51:35] praise the Lord
[51:36] amen he did the he did the big part of
[51:40] it now we must do the little part to to
[51:42] let people know so we we we're talking
[51:45] about Jehovah himself but I would step
[51:46] back a little bit and like I said I was
[51:49] not able to cover
[51:51] cover all I was dealing with on Sunday
[51:55] so I'm going to go fast you got to you
[51:57] got to try and catch up with me if not I
[52:00] will leave you behind amen might do a
[52:02] little bit of too much reading this
[52:04] evening just to be able to cover uh uh
[52:08] some of the things we left we left out
[52:10] on on Sunday so on Sunday what we were
[52:12] talking about uh stay talking about Paul
[52:15] and Apostle but we were talking about
[52:17] the uh the apostle
[52:21] of our profession
[52:22] Paul called Jesus the pro the Apostle of
[52:26] our profession
[52:28] and our high priest
[52:30] praise the Lord he is our Apostle and he
[52:35] is our high priest of our profession our
[52:39] confession praise the Lord so we were
[52:41] looking at their man so you see Jesus
[52:43] fulfilled the Apostle ship he is Jehovah
[52:47] 7 Peter called him the chief Shepherd
[52:49] praise the Lord uh uh uh Solomon called
[52:54] him in Ecclesiastes as the preacher
[52:56] that's what that book means the preacher
[52:58] the ones that Proclaim
[53:01] that what it means
[53:03] are we together
[53:05] praise the Lord so let's go very very
[53:08] quick here the uh God God doesn't call
[53:11] the man to judgment with our first
[53:13] warning him brother Branham in a quick
[53:16] way yeah he he went over the the the the
[53:19] faithful Ministry so let's do that
[53:21] quickly if we can just run through that
[53:24] he says but you see in the church there
[53:26] is a pastor and that Pastor is a special
[53:29] person he's built to where
[53:34] to where he can put up with the forces
[53:37] of the people he is the burning Bearer
[53:40] he is the ox of the team he's a man that
[53:44] can sit down somebody got something
[53:46] against somebody else and sit down with
[53:48] them with them two families and and take
[53:52] care uh
[53:54] neither side and reason it out and bring
[53:57] it right back into sweetness see he's a
[54:01] pastor he knows how to take care of
[54:03] things praise the Lord then he goes to
[54:06] the Evangelist the Evangelist is also a
[54:09] special man every one of them are
[54:10] special in their calling there is no
[54:13] comparison here amen whether we're not
[54:15] running Rat Race everybody this bill
[54:17] different everybody is designed
[54:19] different for what they are called they
[54:22] are evangelists is a special man he's a
[54:25] man that's burning like a fireball he
[54:30] runs into a city and he preached his
[54:32] message then get out of there somewhere
[54:36] else see he's a special man praise the
[54:40] Lord
[54:40] we know about Philip
[54:44] he was an evangelist
[54:46] praise the Lord
[54:48] he was an evangelist and and I mean he
[54:51] preached uh the spirit lift him up you
[54:54] know well I mean that that is just a
[54:57] scriptural uh uh scene or the scriptural
[55:00] type of how the spirit deals with the
[55:02] Evangelist he lifting up whereby the
[55:06] Apostle the the spirit will set him down
[55:08] because he have to stay there with the
[55:11] people settle them
[55:13] but with the Evangelist I mean the the
[55:17] fire is right on him
[55:19] amen is Right honor him he's ready to go
[55:23] he can sit down
[55:25] are we together
[55:26] now
[55:28] uh on Sunday also we read a code where
[55:31] brother Brown says if if a man is called
[55:33] to be a deacon is better you stay in
[55:35] that office of the deacon now we're
[55:36] talking about the Evangelist you see in
[55:38] the Old Testament sorry you see in a
[55:41] book of Acts the uh the first church
[55:43] there were law that the among the seven
[55:46] uh deacons the seven men that was
[55:49] choosing to be deacons we realized that
[55:52] Stephen was a preacher and Philip was an
[55:55] evangelist
[55:56] praise the Lord so that gave us the
[56:01] sense that in in many local churches you
[56:05] will find that uh in in many cases
[56:09] you'll find uh uh
[56:12] meant that that that are ministers you
[56:16] know they were they will they will serve
[56:18] in the office of a deacon
[56:20] if they meet the qualification because
[56:22] you like I said on Sunday you see there
[56:25] there is there is a lot of similarity
[56:28] between the qualification of a deacon
[56:30] and the qualification of a pastor
[56:33] praise the Lord look on the brain and
[56:36] Ministry brother Collins was a Methodist
[56:38] uh uh Pastor he came he was serving as a
[56:42] deacon most of the brothers that were
[56:44] serving as a deacon when it came here to
[56:46] work we brought a brand and building the
[56:48] message the first self you know there
[56:50] were ministers you know in in the air in
[56:53] their group but they came and they were
[56:55] able to serve the church as a deacon
[56:57] praise the Lord
[56:59] amen because it also fulfilled the place
[57:03] where the Bible says a deacon must be
[57:06] able to teach at decom must be apt to
[57:09] teach now it does not means that if a
[57:13] man does not have a calling as an
[57:15] evangelist or a calling to teach he
[57:18] cannot be a deacon no no that's not not
[57:21] that's not what it means uh the the the
[57:23] the the
[57:25] Deacon being able to teach also means
[57:29] that a deacon must be one that is solid
[57:32] in the word
[57:33] amen that you can be able to go to and
[57:37] ask questions and he can put you right
[57:39] in the word
[57:41] are we together
[57:43] praise the Lord he might not be able to
[57:45] come behind a puppy with an emotion but
[57:48] he can give you a scriptural answer
[57:51] amen
[57:52] to a scriptural question
[57:54] are we together so I just I just decided
[57:57] to put this in because we're talking
[57:58] about the Evangelist he's a special man
[58:01] he's a man that is burning like a fire
[58:04] he runs into a city he preached his
[58:06] message then gets out there somewhere
[58:09] see he's a special man the teacher is a
[58:13] special man he sit back under the
[58:16] anointing
[58:17] amen
[58:19] of the spirit and is able to take the
[58:23] word and put them together by the Holy
[58:27] Ghost if you see a man there has a
[58:31] teaching gift he can take the Bible he
[58:34] can line up with the courts
[58:37] praise the Lord a man can take the
[58:39] scripture he can take verse by verse by
[58:42] verse and line it up by the scripture
[58:44] and if he can't find his way back to the
[58:47] message there's a problem
[58:53] praise the Lord
[58:54] or he can build you quotes and quotes
[58:57] and quotes and broadbands and bread
[58:58] basket and if he cannot find his way
[59:01] back to the scripture then there is a
[59:03] problem
[59:07] a teacher will be able to give us that
[59:10] balance he sit back on the anointing of
[59:13] the spirit and he's able to take the
[59:15] word and put them together put them
[59:17] together by the Holy Spirit
[59:20] that the pastor or the Evangelist either
[59:23] one could not compare with him
[59:27] praise the Lord
[59:28] amen amen
[59:30] as the pastor I have a duty to teach but
[59:33] I'm not a teacher
[59:37] praise the Lord
[59:39] amen
[59:41] so I I I I just I just trying to drop
[59:45] all of these things in here running my
[59:47] way now the next one he sees right here
[59:49] and then we find out the Apostle he's
[59:52] also a special man
[59:54] he's a
[59:56] uh
[59:58] uh sector in order
[1:00:00] he's a man that sent from God to set
[1:00:04] things in order
[1:00:07] praise the Lord amen
[1:00:12] the prophet is a special man the prophet
[1:00:14] is a man of whom the word of the law
[1:00:17] comes to because
[1:00:20] the prophet is so designed life that his
[1:00:25] subconscious and his in his first
[1:00:27] conscience is so close together that he
[1:00:30] doesn't go to sleep to dream a dream he
[1:00:33] sees it when he is wide awake
[1:00:37] see now that's there's something God has
[1:00:42] to do
[1:00:44] he sees what's going on a prophet Falls
[1:00:48] foresee the way see the things that is
[1:00:52] coming he sees the cup of God's Wrath
[1:00:56] fall before
[1:00:59] it is filled now look back there in the
[1:01:02] scripture you see you see uh uh akabas
[1:01:06] you know he saw what was going to happen
[1:01:09] to Paul
[1:01:11] okay he got a vision and so what was
[1:01:14] going to happen to Paul and then uh
[1:01:16] right in the service there in in
[1:01:19] Phillips home he he prophesied the man
[1:01:22] that owned these things change is
[1:01:24] awaiting him
[1:01:27] praise the Lord he saw that Paul was
[1:01:30] going to be bound in Rome
[1:01:33] praise the Lord
[1:01:37] now so he foresee way off he see the
[1:01:42] things that is coming he see the cup of
[1:01:44] God's rightful before it is filled he
[1:01:47] can say thus said the Lord
[1:01:50] amen God will destroy this city except
[1:01:55] you repent why he is an ego
[1:01:58] praise the Lord
[1:02:00] so we have that gift in the faithful and
[1:02:03] then we have a prophet that is a major
[1:02:06] prophet amen so uh the gift in the five
[1:02:10] four will work in a manner way you know
[1:02:13] or addressing things in the local church
[1:02:15] and even things about the city you live
[1:02:18] in about things that is happening you
[1:02:20] know is is then the prophet is also
[1:02:23] there now so we see that we have all of
[1:02:27] these things that brother Branham says
[1:02:29] here so we will see Jesus God has set in
[1:02:32] his church first Apostle a prophet a
[1:02:35] teacher evangelist and Gifts of healing
[1:02:39] in working of miracle and so forth all
[1:02:43] for the perfecting of the sins Jesus
[1:02:46] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:02:48] forever so what is he introducing here
[1:02:50] the fight for Ministry and the nine
[1:02:52] spiritual gift
[1:02:55] okay he's introducing the faithful
[1:02:58] Ministry just like how God has raised
[1:03:01] man and designed them with a fight for
[1:03:04] Ministry there are also nine spiritual
[1:03:06] gifts that God has given to the the
[1:03:10] church
[1:03:12] people that have the the you know the
[1:03:15] the gifts of healing the gift of Miracle
[1:03:17] will read through few of them tonight
[1:03:19] praise the Lord
[1:03:20] are we together
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:26] now so we see here that uh uh these
[1:03:31] gifts are for the body
[1:03:34] praise the Lord
[1:03:35] these gifts are for the body
[1:03:38] there are some things there to share
[1:03:41] with you tonight
[1:03:42] that are very very interesting let's
[1:03:44] let's just go with them let's just go so
[1:03:47] we can manage our time
[1:03:49] question and answer a year he says here
[1:03:51] the Lord having a shadow oh please
[1:03:54] church have faith just a little while
[1:03:57] see you must come under teaching you say
[1:04:02] I don't need no one to teach me after
[1:04:06] the Holy Ghost is come
[1:04:08] my friend
[1:04:10] that gives me just a little room to
[1:04:14] doubt whether you have really got it or
[1:04:17] not
[1:04:18] all of these people that are you know
[1:04:21] that are separating himself you know uh
[1:04:23] you know we we have the tape we can
[1:04:25] listen to the tape at home God can speak
[1:04:27] to us through the tape you know
[1:04:30] I forget I didn't I didn't put that code
[1:04:33] there but it's a direct code but Abraham
[1:04:34] says God never ordained uh uh any kind
[1:04:38] of for uh
[1:04:40] how he called it now mechanic things to
[1:04:43] to lead us God or deemed meant to leave
[1:04:46] us amen so brother Brandon says here if
[1:04:48] we if we if we stay away then just think
[1:04:51] that we have the Holy Ghost we can be
[1:04:53] taught by the Holy Ghost by ourselves he
[1:04:56] says that it shows a little doubt that
[1:04:59] you really didn't get it amen
[1:05:01] praise the Lord that you really didn't
[1:05:04] get it
[1:05:06] he says see the way you are acting see
[1:05:09] the things you are doing if the Bible
[1:05:12] says the holy spirit is the teacher why
[1:05:16] did he why did the Holy Spirit put
[1:05:19] teachers in the church then
[1:05:23] to set the church in order
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:28] praise the Lord to set the church in
[1:05:31] Autumn now let's go go a little further
[1:05:34] here it is it will get interesting as we
[1:05:36] go along amen and that is the way with
[1:05:39] the church if we could get away from our
[1:05:42] little differences and come to Christ
[1:05:45] and forget about the the the outside
[1:05:49] word all forget about our denomination
[1:05:52] and so far and be obedience children and
[1:05:56] be about the father's business to get so
[1:05:59] safe and to do things of God after
[1:06:05] why God will set us to one side and he
[1:06:10] will anoint us with the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:13] then we are positional place in his
[1:06:16] kingdom
[1:06:17] some has the gift of wisdom some have
[1:06:22] knowledge somehow the gift of tongues
[1:06:26] some preach the gospel some are prophets
[1:06:29] and other gift but now God is moving
[1:06:33] the gifts in the church are might as
[1:06:36] well say it
[1:06:38] it on my heart I see it I don't want to
[1:06:41] hurt you Brothers I don't want to hurt
[1:06:43] you sisters but the Pentecostal church
[1:06:45] and the four gospel people uh with these
[1:06:49] gifts do not know how to control them
[1:06:52] they they I guess they are all right but
[1:06:56] you are going why with them
[1:06:59] put them in their place look the the the
[1:07:04] first
[1:07:05] gift is wisdom that's in the nine
[1:07:08] spiritual gift what good is going to do
[1:07:15] is going to do you to have knowledge if
[1:07:19] you don't know have wisdom to know how
[1:07:24] to control your knowledge
[1:07:26] Paul says in Corinthians is just going
[1:07:28] to make you puff up
[1:07:31] you would just argue with people
[1:07:33] praise the Lord
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:37] what good does it do for you to speak
[1:07:39] with tongues if you don't have wisdom to
[1:07:42] know when and how
[1:07:45] and to place it right
[1:07:48] are we together
[1:07:51] so you see then uh
[1:07:58] he says
[1:08:00] Hebrew chapter six I might have placed
[1:08:04] this
[1:08:05] uh
[1:08:07] okay
[1:08:09] healing should be in every local church
[1:08:12] all these gifts operating healing should
[1:08:16] be in every
[1:08:19] believer
[1:08:20] amen
[1:08:22] every believer have the promise that
[1:08:24] they can lay their hands upon the sake
[1:08:26] and they
[1:08:27] will recover
[1:08:29] praise the Lord
[1:08:30] exercise the gifts in your husband and
[1:08:33] in your wife
[1:08:35] if you feel sick say honey lay your
[1:08:37] hands on me
[1:08:39] because it's in the body it's not only
[1:08:41] for the preacher it's not only in the
[1:08:42] pastor
[1:08:43] okay we will tell the pastor later but
[1:08:46] let's lay hands on one another
[1:08:49] praise the Lord
[1:08:50] exercise the gift even in your children
[1:08:52] say honey come and lay your hands on me
[1:08:54] papa is not feeling well my mind is not
[1:08:56] feeling well
[1:08:59] praise the Lord are we together
[1:09:03] now so he says uh
[1:09:10] uh healing should be in every local
[1:09:12] church but don't go
[1:09:17] to seed on those gifts
[1:09:21] don't pay attention to give if God wants
[1:09:24] to use you for something he will do it
[1:09:27] but look
[1:09:29] after The Giver
[1:09:31] don't go seeding on the gift and that
[1:09:35] has been the problem
[1:09:38] that has been the problem
[1:09:40] praise the Lord
[1:09:42] we are not Pentecostals but yet we
[1:09:44] behave like Pentecostal or organization
[1:09:47] because we try to look for for
[1:09:50] manifestation to believe that God is in
[1:09:52] our mess
[1:09:54] praise the Lord
[1:09:56] we have the word
[1:09:59] let's look at what the word is producing
[1:10:01] in our lives
[1:10:03] praise the Lord if the word is not
[1:10:06] bringing you to conviction then you need
[1:10:08] to come to the altar
[1:10:15] are we together
[1:10:17] amen
[1:10:19] I was talking with a brother a good
[1:10:21] friend of mine you know we we Fellowship
[1:10:24] together and uh and uh you know we we
[1:10:27] share thoughts and all of that he called
[1:10:29] me and he asked me and he said he said
[1:10:31] brother one have you ever looked into
[1:10:32] the zodiac and I've been reading some
[1:10:35] things about it is is uh it's very it's

[1:10:41] look into that couple of times and then
[1:10:43] you know and we were just talking you
[1:10:46] know and he says wow it was amazing I
[1:10:48] was reading something you know brother
[1:10:50] brand mentioned the Zodiac and it just
[1:10:52] caught my attention in all of that so as
[1:10:55] we Fellowship you know uh uh and and you
[1:10:58] know just uh sharing with one another
[1:11:01] and uh I I then you know I caught a
[1:11:04] thought and I told him I said look you

[1:11:13] uh we we can we can look and read things
[1:11:17] about it and and be able to appreciate
[1:11:20] you know some of the things there but uh
[1:11:23] we will never be able to go into the
[1:11:26] depth the more you try to do that you
[1:11:28] will straight away
[1:11:30] the reason is because
[1:11:32] God has given us his word
[1:11:36] job could get more from the Zodiac
[1:11:39] because that was what he had
[1:11:42] that was what he had
[1:11:44] he could look to the stars and see
[1:11:46] things that was what he had God spoke to
[1:11:49] them through that because that was what
[1:11:52] they had God gave you this why not look
[1:11:54] in this
[1:11:58] why not look in this this is your zodiac
[1:12:05] are we together
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:08] praise the lord well you can bring
[1:12:11] things from the Zodiac that we edify the
[1:12:13] body
[1:12:15] are we together so you see it's almost
[1:12:17] like the gift in the church
[1:12:21] tongs was the least gift God used that
[1:12:24] at the beginning
[1:12:27] praise the Lord but where where are we
[1:12:30] now
[1:12:31] we are not even in the eye age the IH is
[1:12:34] the prophet where are we we are in the
[1:12:36] intelligence
[1:12:40] we are in the intelligence what does
[1:12:42] that tell us you know I've I've been
[1:12:44] I've been selling something on
[1:12:46] artificial intelligence
[1:12:48] I've been looking at uh intelligence and
[1:12:52] and just saying that uh you know as I
[1:12:56] was reading all of those things I said
[1:12:57] way back I mean in the 50s and in the
[1:13:00] back their brother Brandon is telling us
[1:13:02] about uh intelligence you know you
[1:13:05] remember that story where he he met that
[1:13:07] uh in theater about the Apple you know
[1:13:11] and say Ben was have you backslotted to
[1:13:13] be walking around with preachers you
[1:13:15] know and this is uh you know and brother
[1:13:17] Brahms is can you tell me what
[1:13:19] intelligence put the sap back in the
[1:13:22] Earth
[1:13:23] to stay there until winter pass
[1:13:26] and bring it back up again
[1:13:29] praise the Lord and he led the man to
[1:13:31] Christ because the man could see that
[1:13:34] behind nature there was an intelligence
[1:13:39] actually
[1:13:40] are we together
[1:13:42] and we talk about the mind of Christ the
[1:13:44] mind of Christ is the age of
[1:13:46] intelligence
[1:13:48] is the age of intelligence if we can
[1:13:51] just uh you know uh meditate upon the
[1:13:54] word of God feed our mind with with the
[1:13:57] thoughts of God
[1:14:00] praise the Lord
[1:14:02] you can also just rebuke the Devil with
[1:14:05] a thought
[1:14:06] if you can just feed your mind with the
[1:14:09] thought and that's the reason why I mean
[1:14:12] he will send every bombing every nasty
[1:14:15] thing that he can to our mind
[1:14:19] because he knows that's where we are
[1:14:25] praise the Lord
[1:14:27] amen
[1:14:30] what different it would be if the people
[1:14:32] comes to church you know and then
[1:14:34] they're just just take that time relax
[1:14:36] their mind take everything keep their
[1:14:39] mind on Christ what a service we could
[1:14:41] have
[1:14:46] praise the lord well you see he will he
[1:14:48] will now want to he will do everything
[1:14:50] to distract us you know we can come 40
[1:14:53] minutes before service and and I mean
[1:14:55] take the time to clean our nails take
[1:14:57] the time to you know uh uh you know do
[1:15:01] everything is just not to get our mind
[1:15:04] on Christ
[1:15:08] are we together
[1:15:10] now see what brother Brandon said yes
[1:15:13] there's something I read today I I kept
[1:15:15] that and it took me the whole while to
[1:15:17] look for it I didn't know where I kept
[1:15:18] it but uh we will get down to it I'll
[1:15:21] share it with you I'm trying to
[1:15:24] to be nice tonight
[1:15:26] so I'm running but Brian says here he
[1:15:28] says Martin Luther
[1:15:31] once after speaking in tongues he was
[1:15:33] asked why he didn't preach it he said if
[1:15:37] I preach that my people will go after
[1:15:40] the gift instead of The Giver
[1:15:45] Moody one time speaking and begin when
[1:15:48] when when he was preaching saw on the
[1:15:52] inspiration he spoke with tones he said
[1:15:54] God forgive me
[1:15:56] for uh modern foolish words certainly
[1:16:00] see and they had those things
[1:16:05] We Believe those things but they must be
[1:16:09] put in their place
[1:16:12] and they must not be set as evidence no
[1:16:18] guilt must be served as evidence
[1:16:21] amen not even because a man preached
[1:16:27] must be served as evidence
[1:16:30] are we together
[1:16:39] the thing there must be
[1:16:41] the evidence of the Holy Ghost to you
[1:16:46] is the constant longing in your heart to
[1:16:48] do right
[1:16:50] it means that God is dealing with you
[1:16:54] your desire to do right your desire to
[1:16:57] please God your desire to live above
[1:17:00] your weaknesses
[1:17:02] is to prove that God is dealing with you
[1:17:07] are we together
[1:17:12] am I going too fast
[1:17:14] now listen to this he says I know people
[1:17:16] who could speak with tongues
[1:17:19] this morning is that was morning for him
[1:17:21] but it's evening for us
[1:17:23] setting right in this church and I put
[1:17:27] this quote here because I know that
[1:17:29] in this church I know gifted people
[1:17:34] that are in this church
[1:17:37] amen I remember one time we had a prayer
[1:17:40] meeting some time ago and uh right in
[1:17:43] church here and and I mean we prayed and
[1:17:45] we prayed and we prayed and for some
[1:17:48] reason
[1:17:49] uh
[1:17:51] I heard a young person and uh I mean
[1:17:54] they were they were pouring their heart
[1:17:56] out and and and pretty soon they started
[1:17:59] missing their words because they were so
[1:18:02] caught up in prayer
[1:18:04] and I just felt like there's a gift
[1:18:07] hanging over that child
[1:18:10] if they can just give themselves to God
[1:18:16] praise the Lord
[1:18:19] as a pastor you wash those things
[1:18:22] you wash it you just prayed you just
[1:18:25] prayed you don't feed things into people
[1:18:27] mind
[1:18:29] you would like God to deal with them
[1:18:38] I know people who speak with tongues
[1:18:40] this morning sitting right there in
[1:18:42] church
[1:18:42] if there was no interpreter
[1:18:47] may they be daring to do so
[1:18:51] praise the Lord
[1:18:54] because we have the gift
[1:18:56] see
[1:18:57] you got to remember
[1:19:00] them we means was born under a setting
[1:19:04] line
[1:19:06] I will come back to them your birth has
[1:19:09] a lot to do with it
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:14] it's your name is all about you
[1:19:19] has a make up to it your makeup has to
[1:19:22] do with faith
[1:19:24] no matter what it is this is something
[1:19:27] yet again and I love this one he says I
[1:19:30] believe that a Spirit-filled man or
[1:19:33] woman or a child
[1:19:36] a Spirit-filled man or woman or a child
[1:19:40] that live under the altar of God
[1:19:44] who lived there long until they will be
[1:19:49] speaking in tongues
[1:19:51] and that's that's you know the gift of
[1:19:54] tongues is just like the first thing
[1:19:56] that a baby does
[1:19:58] when a baby is born the first thing the
[1:20:01] baby do to use their tongue and cry yeah
[1:20:03] yeah yeah
[1:20:05] that's the first thing that's what the
[1:20:07] gift of tongues is to the church and
[1:20:09] many times many people uh uh experience
[1:20:13] that
[1:20:14] you know the experience there in a sense
[1:20:16] that like brother Branham says was what
[1:20:19] are the spiritual men or the woman or
[1:20:21] the child if they will live under the
[1:20:23] altar what does he means about that if
[1:20:25] he would live a consecrated life a
[1:20:28] prayerful life he says that it will not
[1:20:31] take long until they will speak with
[1:20:32] tongues
[1:20:33] when a person really gets down into
[1:20:36] praying you guess down into praying
[1:20:39] where you are so involved and you are
[1:20:42] crying before God you are pouring out
[1:20:43] your heart before God many times you
[1:20:45] speak with tongues why because you get
[1:20:48] to the place where you you remember
[1:20:49] words that you that that have no
[1:20:52] understanding but your heart knows what
[1:20:54] you are saying to God
[1:20:59] you are speaking with tongues
[1:21:04] praise the Lord
[1:21:10] amen
[1:21:13] for for the many times that I've
[1:21:15] experienced that it has been with me in
[1:21:17] prayer
[1:21:27] but you see that we we we're living in
[1:21:29] an age where the uh uh uh the the the
[1:21:33] the church denomination has just make it
[1:21:38] because they have make it an Evidence
[1:21:42] now that's the reason why everybody has
[1:21:44] to drag themselves into it and you know
[1:21:47] it have become what it has become
[1:21:52] and not because it has become what it
[1:21:54] has become become we must degrade it no
[1:21:59] it's not because it is what it is what
[1:22:01] the church has make it means that we
[1:22:03] don't need it no
[1:22:07] we need it if you want to experience it
[1:22:09] better balances live under the altar
[1:22:13] he says live under the altar of God and
[1:22:16] it will not take long
[1:22:20] you will ask yourself what have I just
[1:22:22] said
[1:22:24] praise the Lord
[1:22:28] you will also worse that you cannot
[1:22:31] repeat again
[1:22:32] but
[1:22:34] your heart will feed God
[1:22:39] are we together
[1:22:46] are we together
[1:22:49] okay
[1:22:50] I think I'm doing well
[1:22:53] come back to my message I just want I
[1:22:56] just wanted to run through this uh now
[1:22:58] uh uh uh uh
[1:23:01] listen to this now this is this is very
[1:23:04] beautiful
[1:23:06] you see if I tell you that's that's a
[1:23:09] question and answer your number three
[1:23:13] that was a program I found someone not a
[1:23:16] program excuse me on an interview this
[1:23:18] morning baby I'm going to talk about
[1:23:20] something very important now listen to
[1:23:22] me let's read together
[1:23:25] on an interview this morning a person I
[1:23:28] guess they are still here in the
[1:23:31] building
[1:23:32] uh
[1:23:33] uh about speaking with tongues the
[1:23:37] person is a genuine person a real person
[1:23:39] and they have live right
[1:23:42] and they have heard me say the evidence
[1:23:45] of the Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in
[1:23:47] tongues
[1:23:49] and it isn't
[1:23:52] but I advise that person to ask God
[1:23:57] to let them either speak in tongues or
[1:24:00] prophesy
[1:24:02] because
[1:24:03] it's the nature
[1:24:06] what is he talking about
[1:24:09] is interperson nature to have an
[1:24:12] Evidence
[1:24:13] the person needs some physical
[1:24:16] manifestation
[1:24:18] to confirm it to them
[1:24:22] are we together
[1:24:24] now we've brought Abraham being a
[1:24:27] prophet and and and and the gift of
[1:24:31] vision looking into people's life he
[1:24:32] could see that this person is a real
[1:24:34] Christian this person is born again they
[1:24:36] have the Holy Ghost but the the person
[1:24:38] is struggling because they are looking
[1:24:40] for some physical manifestation
[1:24:43] so he said okay I advise the person
[1:24:48] to ask God to let them speak in tongues
[1:24:51] or prophesy because it's the nature is
[1:24:55] going to settle them
[1:24:59] the moment they can experience that they
[1:25:01] are going to be settled it does not mean
[1:25:04] that they will not have battle they will
[1:25:06] not have challenges but it is God deals
[1:25:09] with us with our nature
[1:25:14] praise the Lord
[1:25:15] that's why your battle will not be
[1:25:18] another person battle he don't give us
[1:25:20] nothing that we can bear because he know
[1:25:22] what he puts in US
[1:25:31] praise the Lord
[1:25:32] some people can be going through things
[1:25:34] and different things in their life all
[1:25:37] they need is just a spiritual dream
[1:25:42] the moment they have that is set to them
[1:25:46] praise the Lord
[1:25:47] I'm different
[1:25:49] all I need I must just come to the world
[1:25:51] the word speaks to me all the time I
[1:25:53] don't dream
[1:25:55] I do have dreams let me not say I don't
[1:25:57] dream like
[1:25:59] I just sleep with my eyes open no I
[1:26:02] close my eyes
[1:26:04] amen well I'm not built that way but the
[1:26:07] word speaks to me all the time
[1:26:10] all the time
[1:26:12] things at home things in church things
[1:26:15] about people I would just be there in
[1:26:17] the world and something I will be
[1:26:20] reading something was just question to
[1:26:21] me I said that's it
[1:26:29] so let's continue to read here I I knew
[1:26:32] that this would be a blessing to you so
[1:26:33] brother Graham says the first thing
[1:26:36] I went to that person
[1:26:39] and found their birthplace when he says
[1:26:42] I went to that person with me by vision
[1:26:46] found their birthplace
[1:26:52] and what sign they were born on Earth
[1:26:56] and I could tell what their birth was
[1:27:01] which way
[1:27:03] which way is set in their natural nature
[1:27:09] set them in a certain line
[1:27:12] now you see the whole thing it goes It
[1:27:16] goes with us in every way now look at
[1:27:19] this the constellation of the stars that
[1:27:22] live the wise men
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:26] the three wise men were not three
[1:27:28] brothers that were born in the same
[1:27:30] house
[1:27:32] no they were not living together
[1:27:36] amen but there were three men that had
[1:27:39] the gift to read the Stars
[1:27:42] amen
[1:27:44] and every one of them as they were
[1:27:45] looking at the constellation of the
[1:27:47] Stars they were reading the message that
[1:27:49] a star would rise up in Jacob that style
[1:27:52] means a king would be born you know and
[1:27:55] that's how they gather their gifts and
[1:27:57] so what did they do aligned them up to
[1:28:01] Jerusalem right
[1:28:03] now I'm going to go into something
[1:28:05] tonight and and and the same thing with
[1:28:08] us
[1:28:09] even with a church
[1:28:12] you have a preacher that uh that that is
[1:28:15] you know that is that is gifted in a
[1:28:17] certain way and uh that's that's the
[1:28:19] reason why I better bam said we must we
[1:28:21] must all be 100 together in the word
[1:28:26] if there is one suspiciousness you're
[1:28:29] not going to go any further I can be a
[1:28:32] blessing to you and that just declared
[1:28:34] thought about it
[1:28:36] neither you can be a blessing to me
[1:28:39] now brings it in Family Life the same
[1:28:42] thing in in in marriage I mean we get we
[1:28:45] get so caught up with you know love and
[1:28:47] you know love and that we we get so
[1:28:49] wrapped up in the emotions that we don't
[1:28:52] even see this spiritual part of it
[1:28:55] right even in family life
[1:28:57] sometimes you go through your different
[1:29:00] challenges and all of that and and you
[1:29:03] get to the place where you start to
[1:29:05] become established in your home and
[1:29:08] settle in what actually happened is that
[1:29:11] you're born on a different nature this
[1:29:13] the other person born on a different
[1:29:14] nature even your children are now born
[1:29:17] under the same stars that you are
[1:29:19] how many comes in the home when we all
[1:29:22] starts to line up right
[1:29:25] God giving the grace word I'm lining up
[1:29:28] my nature with my wife
[1:29:30] then pretty soon what you will realize
[1:29:32] is that the fusing will start dropping
[1:29:34] right
[1:29:36] amen we start understanding our children
[1:29:39] and we're lining up with them we're now
[1:29:42] forcing them to do things the way we
[1:29:43] want things done we are understanding
[1:29:45] what is this child dealing with how can
[1:29:48] I support them
[1:29:49] what is this my wife dealing with what
[1:29:52] is this my husband dealing with
[1:29:55] so when all of those things line up then
[1:29:59] there is harmony
[1:30:02] praise the Lord
[1:30:04] instead of looking at all that this
[1:30:07] child is just a child of the devil you
[1:30:09] born a child of the devil
[1:30:16] hold this one this uh oh my God this
[1:30:18] Wonder
[1:30:20] you give birth to it
[1:30:24] are we together
[1:30:30] let me leave the husband and wife you
[1:30:32] figure that out for yourself
[1:30:35] but you see this is it's uh that's
[1:30:38] that's what it is he said brother Brown
[1:30:39] says I went back to look at her
[1:30:41] birthplace
[1:30:44] John Ryan
[1:30:46] that that got his sight under the Bible
[1:30:49] he came in the prayer line the first
[1:30:51] time and then brother Brandon prayed for
[1:30:53] him and uh
[1:30:56] you know he went and he came back again
[1:30:58] he says he said Brandon uh you know uh
[1:31:01] on a vision Broadband says I told you
[1:31:03] say you believe that you receive
[1:31:05] yourself he said yes I believe about it
[1:31:07] my eyes is now open Reverend says on a
[1:31:09] vision I realize that he's a Catholic
[1:31:15] and Catholic love to confess
[1:31:19] so I told him go confessing
[1:31:24] so he picked that thing up
[1:31:27] and when John Ryan go confessing
[1:31:33] he just lined his nature with the word
[1:31:37] that's all we need
[1:31:39] that's all we need
[1:31:42] whatever we are struggling with lining
[1:31:45] up with the word
[1:31:48] you don't need to break your bed you
[1:31:50] don't need to bust the wall
[1:31:52] you just need to submit yourself to the
[1:31:55] word
[1:31:58] created the universe
[1:32:00] there is nothing in us that it cannot
[1:32:02] deal with
[1:32:07] our impatience of submitting to the
[1:32:10] world
[1:32:10] our struggle our stubbornness
[1:32:15] of just saying
[1:32:17] be it unto me according to your word
[1:32:21] and creating an expectation
[1:32:28] are we together
[1:32:31] let's enjoy this together amen if that's
[1:32:34] the only thing we can say tonight then I
[1:32:36] shall be a blessing to you he said first
[1:32:39] I went back and and and uh to that
[1:32:42] person found their birthplace in what
[1:32:43] sign they were born on them
[1:32:45] and they could tell her and could tell
[1:32:48] what their birth was and which way is
[1:32:52] set in the unnatural nature set them in
[1:32:55] in a setting line
[1:32:58] then when they are reborn again
[1:33:02] they are over here in another nature
[1:33:06] amen
[1:33:09] natural nature is line up this way
[1:33:12] and then the new birth is here
[1:33:15] praise the Lord
[1:33:17] but you see the the the the the the you
[1:33:20] know the just like the new birth don't
[1:33:22] change the color of our skin
[1:33:25] amen
[1:33:26] it is how we have to carry this body
[1:33:29] along with the new birth
[1:33:31] are we together
[1:33:37] they are over here on another Nation now
[1:33:39] then when you find it when when you find
[1:33:44] into this nature
[1:33:46] that's the inside the unconscious inside
[1:33:50] conscious they are subconscious move you
[1:33:52] one way that's your natural birth then
[1:33:56] they will they will make up something
[1:33:58] and then a push they push them what
[1:34:01] under
[1:34:04] afford and put them
[1:34:07] in as a split condition
[1:34:11] they don't know what to do they will say
[1:34:14] the Lord want me to do this
[1:34:17] the answer oh I just know is lined up
[1:34:22] with the scripture and they will start
[1:34:24] to do it and the first thing you know
[1:34:27] sit on on this outside will show them
[1:34:31] all kinds of
[1:34:34] uh defect in it and then
[1:34:40] this says oh I guess you know they will
[1:34:43] listen to Satan see you have got to take
[1:34:46] that inside something
[1:34:49] that's what on the inside of you their
[1:34:53] scripture and don't let sit and stand
[1:34:56] any word hold to that right
[1:34:59] amen no matter how your body is pulling
[1:35:02] you whole to your conviction
[1:35:05] go to what you believe in your heart no
[1:35:08] matter how the devil is blasting your
[1:35:10] mind hold to that thing Lord I know you
[1:35:13] promised me Lord this is your word Lord
[1:35:16] you can do it
[1:35:23] that's his duty to stand there they are
[1:35:26] set on duty to stand there and pound at
[1:35:28] you like that but don't you listen to
[1:35:31] him
[1:35:33] but that person I told them they said
[1:35:36] well now if I could just be sure of
[1:35:40] having the Holy Ghost see
[1:35:43] uh uh a deadly person a real loyal
[1:35:47] person
[1:35:49] with the Holy Ghost but it will be good
[1:35:53] for her to say father
[1:35:56] just give me this for something to stand
[1:36:00] on your Broadband was struggling not to
[1:36:02] say whether it was a man or the woman
[1:36:04] but you see here he let it out you know
[1:36:06] praise the Lord
[1:36:09] he was trying to to net but uh uh
[1:36:15] you know he says a real loyal person
[1:36:18] with the Holy Ghost so he knows that she
[1:36:21] had the Holy Ghost
[1:36:23] but she's on the other side struggling
[1:36:25] if I could really have the Holy Ghost
[1:36:31] praise the Lord
[1:36:38] which of course I think in most cases
[1:36:40] it's a good place to be
[1:36:42] amen it's a good place to be than to be
[1:36:45] overconfident
[1:36:49] and then just going to sleep
[1:36:56] I think we just read this tonight and
[1:36:58] prayed okay
[1:37:05] now if I taught it
[1:37:09] if I taught it like that people will
[1:37:12] reach out and get a hold of that without
[1:37:17] having what that person's got so what
[1:37:21] the brother balance is if I was teaching
[1:37:24] they are speaking in tongues
[1:37:26] was the evidence people will go out for
[1:37:30] speaking in tongues and not having a
[1:37:32] real life
[1:37:37] praise the Lord
[1:37:39] they will go out for speaking in tongues
[1:37:41] and not having the real life
[1:37:44] see the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:37:47] speak with tongues but you got to have
[1:37:50] the Holy Ghost first before it can speak
[1:37:54] with tongues
[1:37:56] now you get it see if you reach out and
[1:38:00] get a hold of a gift of speaking in
[1:38:03] tongues now remember
[1:38:05] that can be a genuine gift that could be
[1:38:09] the Holy Ghost speaking with you
[1:38:12] speaking in you
[1:38:14] wave unknown terms and you did be lost
[1:38:18] and go to hell
[1:38:22] yeah because your flesh could be
[1:38:23] anointed
[1:38:25] amen look at this uh uh Saul disobeyed
[1:38:30] and uh he sent his servant to go to go
[1:38:33] meet uh Samuel when they get there they
[1:38:35] started prophesying he sent another
[1:38:38] seven again to go meet Samuel he got
[1:38:40] there he to the spirit God on him he's
[1:38:41] not a prophesy
[1:38:43] saw with throwing Javelin and everything
[1:38:45] he got in the presence of Samuel he too
[1:38:47] started prophesying
[1:38:51] praise the Lord while the atmosphere
[1:38:54] around the prophet just anointed their
[1:38:55] flesh
[1:39:05] so you see yeah I mean the the way God
[1:39:08] deals with us
[1:39:14] that's what that Prophet cries uh you
[1:39:17] know in that Vision stay in line just
[1:39:19] line up with the word
[1:39:23] just line up with the word keep our
[1:39:25] hearts under the altar
[1:39:27] take every foolishness away you I mean
[1:39:30] you will enjoy your Christian Life
[1:39:32] it is going to be sweeter
[1:39:35] amen because you see the Christian life
[1:39:38] is not we we are not fighting for
[1:39:42] victory
[1:39:43] no
[1:39:44] we are fighting from victory
[1:39:49] from Victory because Jesus has already
[1:39:52] overcome everything he have already won
[1:39:55] it we're standing from Victory going
[1:39:56] forward so it has to be Victory and
[1:39:59] victory and Victory
[1:40:08] are we together
[1:40:09] so you see the the the I mean the the
[1:40:12] gifts are there in the body I mean even
[1:40:15] even our little group here I mean uh I
[1:40:17] mean some of the things that I've I've
[1:40:20] seen and I mean some of the things that
[1:40:22] the Lord has has done year that you know
[1:40:24] I've seen people you know uh uh having
[1:40:28] visions
[1:40:31] praise the Lord
[1:40:33] we prayed about it we watch it we see it
[1:40:35] happening
[1:40:38] but we don't want to use give as a seed
[1:40:43] nor we don't want to use give as a seed
[1:40:53] then before Sunday there are 20
[1:40:54] different dreams on paper
[1:40:58] then the church become dreaming Church
[1:41:03] when we're supposed to be living church
[1:41:05] not dreaming Church living
[1:41:10] are we together
[1:41:11] praise the Lord
[1:41:13] I mean I can I can ask you to dream
[1:41:15] dreams I can take it away from you if
[1:41:17] you are Dreaming Dreams there's no way
[1:41:19] that I'm not discouraging that
[1:41:21] but that's not where the emphasis is
[1:41:26] that's not where the dealing of the
[1:41:28] spirit is
[1:41:33] are we together
[1:41:36] now you see that the gifts like we said
[1:41:40] on on Sunday is is for the edifying of
[1:41:44] the body
[1:41:46] okay it's for the edifying of the body
[1:41:48] so even if there is a gift that a person
[1:41:51] have
[1:41:52] if you are not in church
[1:41:54] your gift will never be edifying
[1:42:00] because it's giving for the body and if
[1:42:03] you are separated from the body how will
[1:42:05] you find your place how will you find
[1:42:07] your gift
[1:42:18] praise the Lord amen what is given to us

[1:43:13] is the life that is behind the name that
[1:43:15] makes the demon the demon tremble amen

[1:48:58] things that he gave to the church he's
[1:49:00] there the gifts that he gave to the
[1:49:02] church but he don't want us to be
[1:49:04] spoiled on gift
[1:49:06] he want us to get a hold of The Giver
[1:49:09] he want us to live a life with our heart
[1:49:12] honor the altar constantly
[1:49:17] how much time do we spend in his
[1:49:19] presence

[1:49:55] it's a life we can step forth
[1:50:02] it's not just a life for us to be
[1:50:04] wandering and hoping it's a life for us
[1:50:08] to be believing
[1:50:10] we must be believing we must be on the
[1:50:12] expectation
[1:50:14] we must build expectation I know God is
[1:50:17] going to do it he's going to come at the
[1:50:19] scene
