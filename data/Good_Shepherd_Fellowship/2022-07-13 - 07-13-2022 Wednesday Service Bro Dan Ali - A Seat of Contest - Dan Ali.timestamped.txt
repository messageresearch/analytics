[36:45] god bless your sins
[36:55] yes so we have some visitors in our miss
[36:58] tonight
[37:00] brother paul and sis header
[37:06] god bless you and uh doris uh dora leah
[37:10] and our son
[37:12] is it liam
[37:13] god bless you all for coming
[37:18] and um
[37:20] we just want to thank the almighty god
[37:22] for tonight
[37:25] um
[37:26] as i was coming tonight again i was
[37:28] thinking
[37:31] and uh that thought struck me again
[37:34] that the amateur paratrooper is coming
[37:36] back
[37:39] but praise be to god
[37:42] the lord our god has always been
[37:44] faithful
[37:46] god doesn't care about numbers
[37:49] the bible says well two or three i got
[37:51] it in my name
[37:53] there i am in the amazed
[37:56] if i came and there was only one person
[37:58] praise be to god we are ready to have
[38:00] service
[38:02] and now when brother one told me on
[38:04] friday to get ready i was wondering was
[38:06] it nope
[38:07] today's uh
[38:09] that was monday to get ready
[38:11] i was wondering a lot of things were
[38:13] crossing my mind here and there
[38:15] and
[38:16] i thought i had something to talk about
[38:19] and
[38:20] between yesterday and today
[38:23] a lot
[38:25] has happened
[38:27] and i just want us to have an honest
[38:29] conversation
[38:31] it's not about you know
[38:37] just coming to please anybody
[38:42] of course no preacher will come behind
[38:44] the property because he wants to hurt
[38:45] anybody's feelings
[38:48] we are all trusting in the leadership of
[38:50] the holy spirit
[38:52] so take your focus
[38:55] off me
[38:56] and i believe it's always been the case
[39:00] it doesn't matter how much you love a
[39:01] preacher
[39:03] whether he's the best preacher or your i
[39:05] mean whoever he may be
[39:08] never keep your focus on the man
[39:12] let your focus be on the holy spirit and
[39:15] see where the spirit of the lord is
[39:18] going
[39:20] praise be to god
[39:22] so tonight
[39:24] we have a few things we are going to
[39:26] look at
[39:27] i am not sure if i'm ever going to get
[39:29] my message
[39:31] but if i don't
[39:33] praise be to god
[39:37] if there comes another time
[39:40] i wouldn't mind looking at it again
[39:45] tonight may be the last time i've ever
[39:46] talked about it
[39:48] um i don't know
[39:50] sometimes there is a bedding on your
[39:53] heart
[39:54] and then for some reason it just fills
[39:56] us out
[39:57] and we never find it coming back again
[40:00] so
[40:01] i am not sure if i'm going to do justice
[40:04] to this topic
[40:06] because i feel very much unprepared
[40:09] but my preparedness doesn't mean
[40:11] anything before the lord
[40:14] praise be to god
[40:16] so tonight
[40:18] if we can just stand for the reading of
[40:19] the word
[40:21] we are reading tonight
[40:24] from
[40:25] [Music]
[40:31] isaiah 14
[40:33] 12 and 13.
[40:54] so it's just going to be a little
[40:56] teaching
[40:59] um
[41:28] praise be to god
[41:32] isaiah 14 12 and 13.
[41:37] i read
[41:39] how are that fallen from heaven oh
[41:42] lucifer
[41:43] son of the morning
[41:46] how are thou cut down to the ground
[41:49] which this weakened the nations
[41:53] for thou has said in thine hearts i will
[41:55] ascend into heaven
[41:57] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[42:00] of god
[42:01] i will sit
[42:03] also upon the mount of congregation in
[42:06] the sights of the north
[42:09] i will ascend above the heights of the
[42:11] clouds
[42:13] i will be
[42:14] like the most high
[42:18] shall we turn to revelations
[42:23] the book of revelations 12 7.
[42:50] revelations 12 7
[42:53] and there was war in heaven
[42:55] michael and his angels fought against
[42:56] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[42:59] angels and prevailed not
[43:01] neither was their place found any more
[43:03] in heaven
[43:05] and the great dragon was cast out that
[43:08] old serpent called the devil
[43:11] and satan
[43:12] which is deceiveth the whole world
[43:16] he was cast out
[43:17] into the earth and his angels were cast
[43:20] out with him praise be to god
[43:23] may the lord add his blessings to the
[43:25] reading of sword shall we be seated
[43:30] so tonight
[43:32] i titled this message
[43:35] a seat of contest
[43:38] a seat of contest
[43:43] but before we get to my message tonight
[43:46] as i said
[43:47] a lot of things were just coming my way
[43:49] and i just had to write them down
[43:52] it's just amazing that the hour
[43:55] and the time we are living in we all
[43:57] know how close
[44:00] we are to the end
[44:03] and if there was any time
[44:05] that man was very reckless
[44:09] is this very time we are living
[44:13] we have gotten so so so close
[44:21] and yet we don't seem to care about
[44:24] anything
[44:31] the bible says as it was in the days of
[44:34] noah so shall it be
[44:35] at the coming of the son of man
[44:39] life was normal
[44:42] there was nothing out of the ordinary
[44:46] things were going on okay
[44:48] they were marrying giving in marriage
[44:52] businesses were flourishing
[44:54] people were going out and coming in as
[44:56] usual
[44:58] nothing changed out of the ordinary
[45:03] that did not stop nowhere
[45:06] from preaching the word of god
[45:09] he kept on talking about the word over
[45:12] and over
[45:13] and i believe at the point that people
[45:15] were disturbed
[45:17] what is this that the man is talking
[45:18] about
[45:19] over and over and he never stops
[45:22] i am 80 years old now
[45:25] and this man has never stopped
[45:27] and they probably send much instruments
[45:29] into display into space and to go and
[45:32] come back and tell them that the space
[45:33] is very very dry
[45:35] not even an atom of water out there in
[45:37] space
[45:39] and they were wondering is this man out
[45:40] of his mind
[45:46] if they knew
[45:48] when it was the final call if they knew
[45:51] that was the final call
[45:54] a lot of them would have changed their
[45:55] minds
[45:57] before the flood
[45:58] came but when they had the final call
[46:03] they thought it was one of those things
[46:06] because this has been going on for a
[46:08] long time
[46:09] so don't mind that man he's out of his
[46:11] mind it's one of those things
[46:16] little did they know
[46:18] that that was the final call
[46:22] tonight
[46:23] could be the last day
[46:26] as i said
[46:27] it's going to be a little teaching
[46:29] service tonight
[46:33] and
[46:34] i just trust and believe
[46:37] that god is going to speak to us before
[46:39] we leave here tonight
[46:46] there is there is no crop
[46:49] that would ever flourish without rain
[46:55] rain is good for crops
[46:58] without rain
[47:01] there is no farmer that is going to
[47:02] harvest
[47:06] so rain
[47:08] crops need rain to grow
[47:14] but
[47:16] the rain that falls in spring
[47:19] is different from the rain that falls
[47:22] in fall
[47:25] you say oh it's the same rain coming
[47:27] from the heavens yes it is the same rain
[47:30] coming from the heavens but they are
[47:32] completely different
[47:35] the rain in spring
[47:37] comes to give life
[47:40] the cross are there when the rain comes
[47:42] they are happy
[47:44] and they just spring forth they come
[47:45] back to life
[47:47] and they are ready ready to flourish
[47:50] the same rain comes in fall
[47:55] and then the crops are dying
[47:59] their trees are turning yellow
[48:02] their life is getting out
[48:05] is the same rain
[48:08] and that is the same way it is with the
[48:10] word of god
[48:12] the word of god comes to give life
[48:17] if the word of god comes to you and does
[48:19] not give you life
[48:21] what it brings to you is judgment that's
[48:23] right
[48:24] and that is a dangerous place to be
[48:28] wonder word you can get to a place
[48:31] that the word of god does not lead you
[48:33] to salvation
[48:35] but rather leads you into judgment that
[48:37] is a dangerous thing
[48:43] never take
[48:44] the grace of god for granted
[48:55] make use
[48:57] of the grace of god
[48:59] as it comes yes sir
[49:04] there is a saying
[49:07] that you make hay
[49:09] while the sun shines
[49:15] so you don't make hay
[49:17] when the sun is setting
[49:24] at that point is useless
[49:30] we can talk about
[49:32] eso when he saw his birthright
[49:35] right the bible says
[49:37] he sought after it with tears
[49:40] right
[49:42] i never found it
[49:53] when the grace of god comes to you
[49:59] and you recognize or realize what god is
[50:02] doing
[50:03] and you take a step of faith god honest
[50:06] that
[50:09] but when you keep turning the grace of
[50:10] god away
[50:12] and you just feel god is talking to you
[50:14] you keep turning it down
[50:16] it gets to a point the same word comes
[50:19] to you and you don't feel anything right
[50:22] right
[50:23] sure
[50:25] can pour an anointing oil a bottle of
[50:27] anointing oil on you and pray for you
[50:30] and nothing happens
[50:33] sure
[50:35] when a man
[50:37] has crossed that line of grace
[50:41] it is a dangerous thing even though you
[50:43] are still alive
[50:45] it is a very dangerous place to be
[50:55] so remember
[51:00] this is not my message
[51:02] but it's in line with what i'm going to
[51:04] talk about tonight in a world we are
[51:07] going to come to these things some of
[51:08] these things not everything of course
[51:11] so seek him
[51:13] while he can be found
[51:16] for there is coming a time
[51:20] when you will seek him and would not
[51:21] find him
[51:22] you know
[51:24] now is the time to seek him
[51:27] i'm not trying to scare anybody
[51:32] we have gotten so reckless with our
[51:34] lives
[51:37] that we can be on facebook
[51:41] hours upon hours
[51:43] and we never get tired
[51:47] we can even sit all through the night
[51:49] [Music]
[51:51] just on social media
[51:54] and we never get asleep
[51:57] but we can come to the house of god
[51:59] under the anointing of the word of god
[52:02] and then we sit down and then we just
[52:03] pass out in sleep
[52:05] and sometimes we are here our eyes are
[52:08] open and our minds are far away
[52:23] we need to mean business with god yes
[52:26] yes
[52:30] again
[52:31] never take the grace of god
[52:34] for granted
[52:41] a question just came to mind but i
[52:43] wouldn't ask that question for now i'll
[52:45] probably ask you towards the end of the
[52:47] service
[52:52] the bible says if you hear his voice
[52:55] this day hiding out your heart as in the
[52:57] provocation
[52:59] hebrews 3 15
[53:01] and 4 7
[53:04] if you hear his voice this day
[53:06] hiding out your heart
[53:09] there is something
[53:12] there is a connection between hearing
[53:16] the voice of god and hardening your
[53:18] heart
[53:21] if you hear his voice this day how did
[53:24] not your heart ask in the provocation
[53:29] there is a coordination i say again
[53:33] between hearing the voice of god and
[53:35] what is the voice of god
[53:40] brother abraham said the voice of god is
[53:42] the word of god
[53:46] so when you hear god talking to you
[53:51] do not hide in your heart
[53:54] because the danger is
[53:56] when the word comes
[53:58] and you turn the word down
[54:00] right and the word keeps coming and you
[54:03] keep turning the word down
[54:05] what happens is that you are hurting
[54:07] your heart
[54:12] when we read
[54:14] can we turn our bibles to
[54:20] hebrews 3 15.
[54:33] no that wouldn't be the
[54:35] scripture i'm looking for um
[54:38] that will be exodus exodus 4 21 sorry
[54:43] exodus 421
[54:57] okay
[54:59] exodus 4 21
[55:04] and
[55:05] the anger of the lord sorry um 421 where
[55:08] am i
[55:39] i think i've mixed
[55:42] my scriptures up here
[56:00] i don't know why i got this from but um
[56:02] exodus 4 21 does not actually represent
[56:05] what i want to talk about here tonight
[56:08] and the lord said unto moses
[56:11] when thou goes okay it is
[56:13] and the lord said unto moses when thou
[56:16] goest and return into egypt see that
[56:20] thou do all those wonders before pharaoh
[56:23] which i have put in thine hand
[56:26] but our heart in his heart
[56:28] that he shall not let the people go
[56:31] so first
[56:34] moses was going to perform the miracles
[56:38] right he was going to do what god has
[56:40] asked him to do
[56:43] moses was going to tell
[56:45] pharaoh
[56:46] the mind of god and what god wanted them
[56:50] right
[56:52] then thereafter the hearing of the heart
[56:54] was going to come because he would not
[56:55] allow the people to go
[56:57] now when you read here
[57:00] god was not on a mission
[57:02] to come and hide in pharaoh's heart so
[57:04] he could condemn him
[57:06] he would just let him sit in his seat
[57:09] and just
[57:11] kill him in a second
[57:13] that was starting for god
[57:15] but there is a lesson here i want us to
[57:17] look at
[57:18] now let's go to first samuel 6 6.
[57:26] first somewhere
[57:28] six six
[57:39] wherefore then do ye had in your hearts
[57:43] as the egyptians and pharaoh hardened
[57:46] their house
[57:48] when he had wrought wonderfully among
[57:51] them
[57:52] did they not let the people go and they
[57:55] departed
[57:58] so the book of samuel is telling us
[58:01] that pharaoh and the egyptians
[58:03] hardened their hearts
[58:08] and when you read
[58:10] the book of exodus is saying god had in
[58:13] their hearts
[58:17] now
[58:18] as i was saying
[58:23] in the beginning was the word the word
[58:25] was with god and the word was god right
[58:28] the word of god is god
[58:33] so when the word comes to you or when
[58:36] god speaks to you
[58:39] and you get so stubborn
[58:42] and would not yield
[58:45] and you are so stuck in your ways
[58:49] the word keeps coming and coming and
[58:51] coming and what it does
[58:53] is that it hardens your heart
[58:58] hearty not your heart
[59:00] it is in your hands
[59:03] you can decide
[59:05] whether you want to or not
[59:09] we don't come to church for fun
[59:12] we come to church
[59:14] believing that god will talk to us
[59:17] and when you know god has spoken to you
[59:19] you know it yes
[59:21] when i hear the voice of god and i know
[59:23] something is said i can put my finger on
[59:25] it and i can claim it
[59:27] i tell myself this is for me
[59:32] but when you come to god and you can sit
[59:35] all through the service and you don't
[59:37] hear the voice of god
[59:40] i
[59:42] i don't know how you feel
[59:46] i don't know
[59:50] the bible says
[59:51] the word of god is good for reproof for
[59:54] instruction for correction
[59:56] and it is good for doctrine
[1:00:00] and if you come to church
[1:00:03] in all the ways god can talk to you
[1:00:06] and then you leave after service you are
[1:00:09] living the same way you came in
[1:00:11] sure
[1:00:12] then uh my question is why did you even
[1:00:15] come in the first place
[1:00:23] it's time to do an introspection
[1:00:26] right set your heart
[1:00:30] don't let you know yourself more than
[1:00:32] anybody knows you
[1:00:34] don't let somebody pamper you or make
[1:00:37] you feel good by telling you things you
[1:00:40] know
[1:00:40] are not right
[1:00:43] when you are living the life you know
[1:00:44] you are living the life
[1:00:46] if you are not living the life you know
[1:00:48] you are not living the life
[1:00:53] it's time
[1:00:55] to hold them fast
[1:00:58] because any moment
[1:01:00] it will all be over
[1:01:03] any moment it will all be over
[1:01:08] we say oh it's been 100 years it's been
[1:01:10] 200 years it's been thousand two
[1:01:12] thousand years since they've been
[1:01:14] talking about about all these things it
[1:01:16] has never happened don't worry another
[1:01:18] thousand years
[1:01:20] don't let the devil deceive you
[1:01:23] because that is what he is good at
[1:01:28] praise be to god
[1:01:31] as i said it's just a little teaching
[1:01:33] tonight
[1:01:34] i have not started yet
[1:01:38] whenever i start that is good
[1:01:40] i'm just laying a little foundation
[1:01:43] praise beauty god amen
[1:01:46] yes
[1:01:48] so
[1:01:48] [Music]
[1:01:51] in the message
[1:02:00] in the message conference
[1:02:03] i wrote something down here and um
[1:02:07] just took this quote
[1:02:09] to back it up
[1:02:11] now if you hear the word
[1:02:13] and he doesn't leave your salvation it
[1:02:14] brings judgment as we have said to
[1:02:16] receive the word is to receive god
[1:02:19] to reject the word is to reject god
[1:02:22] and that is judgment
[1:02:23] it's like having the blood
[1:02:25] on your hands
[1:02:27] the blood of the lord jesus christ on
[1:02:28] your hands
[1:02:31] and brethren said having the blood of
[1:02:33] the lord on your hands is judgment
[1:02:36] is judgment yes
[1:02:40] but when that same blood
[1:02:44] is applied to your soul is salvation
[1:02:50] it depends
[1:02:53] on where the blood is applied
[1:02:58] you don't want to have the blood of the
[1:03:00] lord jesus on your hands
[1:03:05] we are children of god
[1:03:10] and
[1:03:12] i'm just
[1:03:13] you know tonight
[1:03:15] i don't know which way we are going to
[1:03:16] go
[1:03:21] but i'm trusting as i've said
[1:03:25] that is for a good cause i believe
[1:03:28] praise be to god
[1:03:31] look i want you to notice something here
[1:03:33] bravo speaking conference 1957
[1:03:37] is so striking
[1:03:39] moses commanded that they take his up
[1:03:42] and dip it into the blood of the lamb
[1:03:45] and spread it
[1:03:46] over the door
[1:03:48] the blood of course represented the
[1:03:50] blood of christ
[1:03:52] the hyssop was common with
[1:03:55] you could find anywhere
[1:03:57] just pick up
[1:03:59] a handful of ways it shows that the
[1:04:02] blood
[1:04:03] is so simple to apply
[1:04:05] the wisd represented faith
[1:04:09] just faith in god
[1:04:11] you don't have to go somewhere else
[1:04:14] just take the faith of god
[1:04:17] the faith of god i was at the last time
[1:04:19] brother brother brother jordan preached
[1:04:22] he was talking about faith
[1:04:25] and that the faith you have
[1:04:26] it's not even your faith
[1:04:29] i was seated over there and it struck me
[1:04:31] so hard
[1:04:32] a lot of the times we say we have faith
[1:04:34] we have faith we have faith
[1:04:36] and you realize that the faith is not
[1:04:38] even yours
[1:04:40] god has to give you faith to believe in
[1:04:43] his word
[1:04:46] there is only one way by which faith
[1:04:48] comes
[1:04:50] the bible says faith coming by hearing
[1:04:53] and hearing by the word of god
[1:04:56] so it is the word of god that brings you
[1:04:58] faith
[1:05:00] so it is god giving you faith yes
[1:05:03] absolutely
[1:05:04] but a man in himself naturally there is
[1:05:08] nothing in you
[1:05:10] to believe in the world
[1:05:12] god has to give it to you
[1:05:17] if you need faith talk to god
[1:05:20] just read your bible
[1:05:25] the basic things we ought to do as
[1:05:27] christians
[1:05:29] read your bible and pray every day you
[1:05:31] want faith read your bible and pray
[1:05:34] every day you won't fight listen to the
[1:05:36] tips
[1:05:37] listen to the prophet you want help
[1:05:40] live by the word
[1:05:41] um
[1:05:43] that is how faith comes
[1:05:45] do not think that by fasting 40 days and
[1:05:47] 40 nights faith will just drop anywhere
[1:05:49] no
[1:05:50] god is not going to sidestep his wife
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:05:56] god so much esteemed his own word
[1:05:59] that when he came
[1:06:01] he did not disregard his word right and
[1:06:03] you think god would disregard his word
[1:06:05] for you no way no sir
[1:06:10] praise be to god
[1:06:13] the faith of god
[1:06:21] the wish represented faith
[1:06:24] just faith in god you don't have to go
[1:06:26] anywhere else
[1:06:27] just take the faith of god and apply the
[1:06:30] faith
[1:06:30] to your heart say
[1:06:32] i am separated from the things of the
[1:06:34] world because
[1:06:36] by faith
[1:06:37] i apply the blood
[1:06:40] to my case this morning i shall be
[1:06:43] healed
[1:06:44] because i apply the blood
[1:06:46] over the lentil
[1:06:49] of my heart
[1:06:51] i will never let doubt
[1:06:53] strike me again
[1:06:55] for i will protect myself
[1:06:57] by placing the blood of jesus by faith
[1:07:01] my hyssop over my door
[1:07:04] and no enemy will enter in
[1:07:07] i will never disbelieve god's word
[1:07:09] anymore praise be to god
[1:07:16] faith
[1:07:17] in god's word
[1:07:19] that is what overcomes the enemy
[1:07:22] you may never understand what god is
[1:07:24] doing
[1:07:26] you don't have to understand if god
[1:07:29] gives you grace to understand praise god
[1:07:32] but you don't have to understand
[1:07:34] everything god is doing as a matter of
[1:07:36] fact you don't you don't sometimes you
[1:07:39] don't even know what god is doing until
[1:07:41] it is done right then you can look back
[1:07:45] and then you say oh it was god but it is
[1:07:47] done
[1:07:48] right
[1:07:51] that is why we need patience
[1:07:54] in this journey with our lord
[1:07:56] my mom we need the patience of god
[1:08:01] patience
[1:08:02] is very crucial
[1:08:05] i remember
[1:08:06] in our new year meeting um
[1:08:09] you know that little time we had i
[1:08:11] talked about having patience with
[1:08:13] yourself be patient with yourself right
[1:08:16] be patient with others
[1:08:18] be patient with god
[1:08:20] brother ben narada came
[1:08:23] and then he walks right in
[1:08:25] be patient with yourself be patient with
[1:08:28] god be patient with others
[1:08:31] you need to be patient
[1:08:33] in our lives as christians you need to
[1:08:35] be patient
[1:08:36] at home as a family
[1:08:38] you need to be patient yeah at work you
[1:08:41] need to be patient with others right now
[1:08:44] when you if you leave your family and
[1:08:46] you look at somebody else's family and
[1:08:48] you see everything going on very well
[1:08:50] and then you come to your house and say
[1:08:52] why is everything going on wrong in this
[1:08:54] house
[1:08:55] you don't know what god is doing
[1:08:58] can you imagine a farmer going to
[1:08:59] somebody's farm
[1:09:01] and then he looks at his crops yes and
[1:09:03] then the corn is looking so nice
[1:09:06] maybe five feet tall
[1:09:08] and then he goes back to his farm and
[1:09:10] then he looks at his farm and then he
[1:09:12] said why are you three feet tall
[1:09:16] i planted you at the same time that
[1:09:18] never planted this corn right dark corn
[1:09:21] is five feet tall why are you three feet
[1:09:25] you are going to get five feet tall
[1:09:26] today you hold every one of them
[1:09:29] five feet
[1:09:31] five feet
[1:09:33] five feet
[1:09:34] by the time you are done you have no fun
[1:09:42] it's true
[1:09:44] praise the lord
[1:09:47] you don't know what god is doing
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:50] absolutely
[1:09:52] just be patient with god
[1:09:56] be patient with yourself
[1:09:58] be patient with others we need peace a
[1:10:01] lot of patience in this journey
[1:10:04] patience is something that we lack
[1:10:07] so so badly i just i think okay not i
[1:10:10] think
[1:10:11] so
[1:10:12] we are going to change
[1:10:14] things a little over here praise be to
[1:10:16] god
[1:10:18] yes
[1:10:19] so
[1:10:20] remember
[1:10:22] that in our walk with god
[1:10:25] never never never underestimate what god
[1:10:28] can do in your life
[1:10:31] yes sir
[1:10:33] if a dry stick
[1:10:36] a dry stick
[1:10:40] can blossom yes sir
[1:10:42] praise
[1:10:47] if dead bones
[1:10:50] not somebody that is sick
[1:10:52] dead completely dead
[1:10:56] and
[1:10:56] right
[1:10:58] if they can come back to life
[1:11:01] think about what god would do
[1:11:04] with you that is a life yes ma'am
[1:11:07] a lot of the times we don't yield too
[1:11:10] much that's right we just want to give a
[1:11:13] portion of our lives to god right and we
[1:11:15] want to hold on to another portion
[1:11:17] yes
[1:11:20] it is either god is in the driver's seat
[1:11:23] or he is not
[1:11:29] there is a lot god can do in your life
[1:11:32] if you completely surrender yes sir
[1:11:37] do not look at you
[1:11:39] because there is nothing good in a man
[1:11:41] to look at no
[1:11:43] maybe there are things good in your life
[1:11:44] that is good
[1:11:46] but there is nothing good in a man to
[1:11:49] look at
[1:11:50] always keep your focus on god
[1:11:56] if you are the type
[1:11:58] that love to go into your dirty laundry
[1:12:00] once in a while
[1:12:02] the devil will make sure he keeps you
[1:12:04] busy
[1:12:07] because that dirty laundry is always
[1:12:08] there
[1:12:09] and then he'll keep throwing things at
[1:12:11] you right through
[1:12:13] keep your focus on god
[1:12:16] amen the past is behind us
[1:12:19] yes
[1:12:20] and if ever you have to remind yourself
[1:12:24] or think of the past
[1:12:26] is to see the greatness of god where god
[1:12:29] took you from yes sir what god has done
[1:12:32] in your life how far he has brought to
[1:12:34] you absolutely
[1:12:36] but not to look at your past
[1:12:39] and then crave for it in any way form of
[1:12:42] shame right
[1:12:44] it's so rotten and filthy
[1:12:47] nothing good in the past no sir keep
[1:12:50] your focus on god praise be to god amen
[1:12:53] we are going to study this anyhow
[1:12:55] anywhere we reach praise be to god amen
[1:12:58] now
[1:12:58] a seed of contest
[1:13:01] what is the context
[1:13:03] bro said in the message contest he said
[1:13:06] contest is a show
[1:13:08] of power
[1:13:12] praise be to god
[1:13:13] a shot of power now it doesn't take
[1:13:17] one person
[1:13:20] to engage in a contest
[1:13:22] right
[1:13:23] if it's just one person there is no
[1:13:25] contest right winner takes all
[1:13:28] but for it to be a contest
[1:13:31] ought to be another person yes
[1:13:34] interested
[1:13:35] in whatever it is
[1:13:39] somebody else must be in the picture for
[1:13:42] it to be a contest yes so a contest is a
[1:13:46] show
[1:13:47] of power
[1:13:48] the bible says we wrestle not against
[1:13:50] flesh and blood but against
[1:13:52] principalities powers against rulers of
[1:13:54] darkness evil spirits what have you you
[1:13:58] can mention them right so we are
[1:14:00] wrestling against
[1:14:02] spirits
[1:14:04] praise be to god now
[1:14:09] you know there are many things
[1:14:12] uh we could base this on
[1:14:15] the prophet speaking
[1:14:17] um
[1:14:18] just in a minute
[1:14:20] but i want to speak of these
[1:14:24] minutes quickly
[1:14:25] upon the greatest contest there is
[1:14:28] does between the church and satan
[1:14:32] the great strength of satan
[1:14:35] and we want to speak of the great
[1:14:37] strength of god
[1:14:39] in his
[1:14:40] church now
[1:14:43] this great contest
[1:14:45] has been going on for many years
[1:14:48] it started in heaven
[1:14:50] and satan was kicked out into the earth
[1:14:54] and then he become an enemy to god's
[1:14:56] people
[1:14:58] and since then he has used all his
[1:15:00] strength and his strategy to try to pull
[1:15:04] god's people across the fires
[1:15:06] or into the into his fires
[1:15:09] and we know
[1:15:11] who has the most power
[1:15:13] god does
[1:15:15] and god when he gave his people the best
[1:15:18] thing
[1:15:18] that he could
[1:15:20] he could to combat satan with
[1:15:23] what's his word right
[1:15:25] now because the word is god
[1:15:28] and god is stronger
[1:15:33] and who is stronger than god
[1:15:36] so the word is god and the word becomes
[1:15:39] our strength
[1:15:40] god in the church
[1:15:42] becomes his strength
[1:15:45] to pull satan to his own fires
[1:15:48] that he has made
[1:15:50] praise be to god
[1:15:52] amen so you begin to think
[1:15:55] what is the value
[1:15:57] of a church without god
[1:16:02] when a body
[1:16:05] would put god out of the church
[1:16:07] right
[1:16:09] and god is no longer part of what is
[1:16:11] going on in that church
[1:16:13] in that assembly
[1:16:15] what is the value of that church
[1:16:19] if god is the strength yeah
[1:16:22] our strength as a body
[1:16:25] and god is not part of what we are doing
[1:16:28] here
[1:16:29] then we better close our bibles and just
[1:16:31] go home
[1:16:38] we have to make sure
[1:16:41] that as an assembly
[1:16:43] or as individuals as families
[1:16:47] that
[1:16:48] you look in the mirror of god's word
[1:16:50] yeah and then you see yourself
[1:16:58] if you read the bible
[1:17:01] and you don't see god talking to you go
[1:17:03] back and read it again yes sir
[1:17:06] it is not how many pages you read a day
[1:17:09] that matters it doesn't mean anything
[1:17:12] right if you have to take a single
[1:17:15] scripture
[1:17:17] and they just stay on it for days and
[1:17:20] weeks
[1:17:21] and see god unfolding this in your life
[1:17:24] speak it to you day in day out stay
[1:17:28] there
[1:17:30] until you feel that oh
[1:17:32] god has completely dealt with you
[1:17:35] right now
[1:17:36] then if you have to move on move on
[1:17:39] right
[1:17:42] it is not reading from genesis to
[1:17:43] revelation right no right it's good
[1:17:48] so oh i can say that i have read all the
[1:17:50] bible ten times already
[1:17:52] and out of the ten times what have you
[1:17:54] got in arabic
[1:17:55] right here amen
[1:18:00] praise be to god
[1:18:02] we must see the word becoming flesh in
[1:18:06] our lives on a daily basis
[1:18:12] every good investor
[1:18:14] when they come to the end of the year
[1:18:19] what they do is that they analyze their
[1:18:22] books
[1:18:24] they see
[1:18:25] they they they try to find out why did
[1:18:27] we go right
[1:18:29] why did we go wrong
[1:18:31] how much did you make
[1:18:32] how much did we lose
[1:18:34] right and then they tried to rest
[1:18:37] strategize
[1:18:38] right and if they made a mistake
[1:18:41] somewhere
[1:18:42] they don't go back doing the same thing
[1:18:45] over again no
[1:18:47] they try to change the strategy this
[1:18:49] time right
[1:18:52] and every child of god
[1:18:54] the good christian that you are
[1:18:57] when you come to the end of the year
[1:18:59] take stock of your life
[1:19:02] look at yourself
[1:19:05] look at yourself where you started from
[1:19:09] and see is the end of the year already
[1:19:12] where am i with god
[1:19:14] sure
[1:19:15] and sometimes we start with god here and
[1:19:18] by the time the year ends we are down
[1:19:20] here
[1:19:23] and then we do not change anything in
[1:19:25] our lives we still go on doing the same
[1:19:27] thing over and over and we expect a
[1:19:29] miracle to happen miracles don't happen
[1:19:32] that way no sir
[1:19:36] god is not a magician
[1:19:42] miracles don't happen that way
[1:19:44] that you go on doing the same old things
[1:19:48] and you expect something new
[1:19:50] to happen
[1:19:53] it doesn't happen that way
[1:19:57] you must challenge yourself
[1:20:00] challenge yourself
[1:20:03] settle for anything less
[1:20:06] right
[1:20:08] don't look across your shoulder
[1:20:10] and probably you see a brother or a
[1:20:11] sister
[1:20:13] who is doing something out of the way
[1:20:15] and you tell yourself oh we are brothers
[1:20:17] we are sisters this is doing why can't i
[1:20:19] do it you should know better than that
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:23] you should know better than that yes sir
[1:20:27] if there is anything to copy
[1:20:30] or to learn from somebody's life they
[1:20:32] should be the good things
[1:20:34] right
[1:20:35] why should you let something buy from
[1:20:37] somebody
[1:20:39] yeah one time in our morning devotion i
[1:20:41] was asking the children
[1:20:43] i said look
[1:20:45] i'm your daddy
[1:20:48] but when you come between daddy and god
[1:20:50] you must choose god
[1:20:52] if you choose me i'll never be proud of
[1:20:54] you
[1:20:54] and remember god will never be proud of
[1:20:56] you
[1:20:57] i said behold if you were driving behind
[1:20:59] me
[1:21:00] and i was in front of you
[1:21:02] doing 60 or 80
[1:21:04] and then i slid off the road
[1:21:07] and entered the ditch or the swamp
[1:21:10] would you say oh i love my daddy so much
[1:21:14] let me just follow him into the ditch
[1:21:17] you are not going to do that you know
[1:21:19] better than that
[1:21:22] praise be to god
[1:21:25] the best and the most reasonable thing
[1:21:26] you would do is you pack up there
[1:21:29] probably call for help
[1:21:31] of come there to help me out right you
[1:21:33] will not drive in there because your
[1:21:35] lord that did too much
[1:21:37] that means there is something wrong here
[1:21:39] right
[1:21:40] sure
[1:21:44] if there is anything to learn
[1:21:47] if there is anything to emulate
[1:21:49] there should be the good things
[1:21:52] but a lot of the times
[1:21:54] people get attracted to the bathrooms
[1:21:57] if this one is doing why can't i do it
[1:22:00] sure
[1:22:01] the bible says do not follow or that's
[1:22:04] the same yes right
[1:22:09] a seat of contest
[1:22:12] where i have reached
[1:22:14] i know
[1:22:16] that will not finish this
[1:22:19] but it was not meant to be finished
[1:22:22] so if you don't finish it
[1:22:24] there is nothing wrong with that
[1:22:26] so a seat of contest
[1:22:28] a seat in other words a true
[1:22:32] now it can be political
[1:22:34] sure like we have the white house
[1:22:37] um it can be a monarchy
[1:22:40] like we have buckingham palace
[1:22:42] uh we have other kingdoms still around
[1:22:46] um it can be traditional
[1:22:48] right
[1:22:49] these are all seats so it does not
[1:22:52] matter whether it is a traditional
[1:22:55] authority whether it's a political
[1:22:57] entity whether it is a monarchy
[1:22:59] a seat or a throne
[1:23:03] is viewed across the same level sure
[1:23:07] now
[1:23:08] there is
[1:23:09] there is so much power
[1:23:12] and authority
[1:23:13] that is vested
[1:23:16] in a throne
[1:23:17] or in a seat for that matter
[1:23:19] now
[1:23:20] every throne or every seat
[1:23:23] has its fortification
[1:23:28] you can't just somebody like me i can't
[1:23:30] just walk
[1:23:32] straight to the white house
[1:23:35] and tell the people i'm here to see the
[1:23:37] president
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:40] you must be somebody
[1:23:42] right to be able to walk through that
[1:23:43] door
[1:23:45] you're right
[1:23:46] not everybody is able to just come in
[1:23:49] and say i want to see the president
[1:23:51] right
[1:23:52] you have to call
[1:23:54] identify yourself who you are book an
[1:23:56] appointment
[1:23:58] and then you go to the gates before you
[1:24:00] even get there they have they have they
[1:24:02] have we are in the technology
[1:24:04] technological world
[1:24:05] they have already seen you coming you
[1:24:08] are going through the gates
[1:24:11] there are mechanisms there to make sure
[1:24:15] that extra machines there is nothing on
[1:24:17] you that is going to harm the president
[1:24:20] right
[1:24:21] and you go in there
[1:24:24] and all eyes are on you
[1:24:26] there are people on their computers you
[1:24:28] are not seeing them but they are looking
[1:24:29] at you you are being monitored yes
[1:24:34] and you will say maybe it's just a
[1:24:35] political authority alone no
[1:24:38] there is a place i know of
[1:24:40] in africa
[1:24:42] it's not easy to see their king
[1:24:45] when you come
[1:24:47] you have to book an appointment
[1:24:49] it's probably more difficult to see that
[1:24:51] king than it is to see the american
[1:24:53] president here sure
[1:24:55] and when you get to the gates and you
[1:24:58] see the people with their mercedes
[1:25:02] and their eyes so red if you had any
[1:25:04] evil motive
[1:25:05] nobody would advise you
[1:25:11] and when they open the gates
[1:25:13] and then you enter the gates and they
[1:25:15] close the door behind you
[1:25:17] you know from that point on
[1:25:19] that you have to behave yourself
[1:25:22] because if you misbehave
[1:25:24] you will not leave to tell the story
[1:25:28] there is so much
[1:25:30] power and authority right
[1:25:34] on the trunk
[1:25:35] or on the seat
[1:25:37] remember we are talking of a seat of
[1:25:40] contest
[1:25:41] now
[1:25:42] there is so much power and authority
[1:25:45] in the seat
[1:25:47] so much so
[1:25:48] that it becomes
[1:25:51] an envy
[1:25:52] the envy of an angel at the envy of the
[1:25:55] people right right
[1:25:57] those who love it
[1:26:00] love it for what it is
[1:26:02] yeah and those who hate it
[1:26:04] hate it for the same reason
[1:26:07] absolutely
[1:26:09] so
[1:26:10] when you look at
[1:26:12] i didn't know i didn't know the
[1:26:14] computers here the computers in america
[1:26:16] were a little different from those in
[1:26:18] africa
[1:26:20] when i was typing and i'm putting cool
[1:26:22] detail
[1:26:25] the computer flat it
[1:26:28] how many how many here know what a code
[1:26:30] it is
[1:26:32] what is that presbyter
[1:26:35] yes
[1:26:37] very good
[1:26:40] too overthrow an insurrection i mean
[1:26:43] in africa that one has happened a lot
[1:26:47] and the computers in africa know it you
[1:26:50] putting a cool detail anywhere in africa
[1:26:52] the computer will fake it but i put in
[1:26:54] cool detail here the computer didn't
[1:26:55] know it i said wow i'm not surprised
[1:27:02] oh my god so yes the soldiers in africa
[1:27:06] have disturbed
[1:27:07] the system a lot
[1:27:10] you just go to bed one night
[1:27:12] and then you wake up the following
[1:27:13] morning and then you hear a soldier
[1:27:16] speaking on on on on on on the news they
[1:27:20] have taken over the the administration
[1:27:22] of the country
[1:27:23] and then that is the end of it they have
[1:27:25] overthrown the constitution now the
[1:27:26] military
[1:27:28] is going to rule
[1:27:30] so any time there is an insurrection
[1:27:35] or there is a coup d'etat
[1:27:39] all the mayhem
[1:27:41] all the problem
[1:27:43] all the killing
[1:27:45] all the destruction
[1:27:47] is aimed
[1:27:49] at getting to the seat of government
[1:27:54] when there is a rebel movement
[1:27:57] any part of the country they are not
[1:28:00] fighting and running away from the from
[1:28:02] from that room they are actually
[1:28:04] fighting
[1:28:06] and they are making gains and they are
[1:28:08] coming straight to the capital where the
[1:28:11] seat of government
[1:28:12] is that is why they are coming
[1:28:17] they may kill people on the way
[1:28:19] they may dig holes on the road
[1:28:21] they may set houses on fire
[1:28:24] that is not where their interest is
[1:28:27] they their interest
[1:28:29] is in the seat of government
[1:28:32] their interest
[1:28:33] is in the true on the throne
[1:28:35] that is why they are coming
[1:28:38] and they will come and even when they
[1:28:40] enter the city
[1:28:41] i don't care if they control 99 of the
[1:28:44] country
[1:28:46] that one percent that is left
[1:28:48] which is the seat of the which is the
[1:28:50] seat of government or which is the
[1:28:52] throne
[1:28:53] if they don't capture it
[1:28:55] they know they don't have power
[1:28:59] right right yes
[1:29:02] and they would come
[1:29:03] and as i said every throne has a
[1:29:06] fortification
[1:29:07] you go to the castles
[1:29:09] you go to the presidential machines
[1:29:12] there are walls barricades and what have
[1:29:15] you and they come and they are outside
[1:29:17] and they are putting bullet holes
[1:29:19] everywhere
[1:29:21] it doesn't matter how many bullet holes
[1:29:22] they put on the wall
[1:29:24] so long as they don't get
[1:29:28] the president
[1:29:30] right
[1:29:31] they know they don't have authority
[1:29:34] right
[1:29:36] the authority is not in the building
[1:29:41] it is not in the architecture of the
[1:29:43] building
[1:29:44] it is not how nice the paint is
[1:29:47] but inside the building there is an
[1:29:49] authority
[1:29:51] and that is what they want
[1:29:54] and if they can destroy everything
[1:29:56] and still not get the president
[1:30:00] the president may be in his bunker
[1:30:02] and still giving announcement and
[1:30:04] telling the country everything is under
[1:30:07] control every everybody is believing him
[1:30:10] right and not the people that want to
[1:30:12] overtake power
[1:30:15] a seat of contest
[1:30:17] that is how strong
[1:30:20] a tron is
[1:30:22] yes and that is how much attraction
[1:30:26] it has
[1:30:30] praise be to god
[1:30:32] [Music]
[1:30:43] and now
[1:30:46] as we read
[1:30:50] the bible says there was war in heaven
[1:30:53] yeah why
[1:30:55] because satan
[1:30:58] lucifer at the time
[1:31:00] right
[1:31:02] wanted
[1:31:03] to pitch his throne yes
[1:31:06] above the stance
[1:31:08] yes
[1:31:09] he wanted the throne of god
[1:31:12] he wanted to sit on the throne of god in
[1:31:16] the seat of god
[1:31:18] and be worshipped right as god yes
[1:31:22] remember we are talking about a seat of
[1:31:25] context yes
[1:31:28] the bible says godliness with
[1:31:30] contentment
[1:31:32] it's a great game
[1:31:34] be happy what god has made you yes sir
[1:31:37] don't desire to be to be like anybody
[1:31:41] don't
[1:31:42] convert don't convert
[1:31:46] whatever god has blessed you
[1:31:49] be happy god has placed you there
[1:31:54] lucifer was not happy
[1:31:56] right
[1:31:57] with all the powers he had yes he wasn't
[1:32:01] happy
[1:32:02] but he wanted to sit on the train of god
[1:32:04] and be worshipped as god right
[1:32:07] and we all know the story i'm not going
[1:32:10] to waste my time so much there and there
[1:32:12] was one in heaven
[1:32:14] against lucifer and his angels against
[1:32:16] michael and his angels
[1:32:18] yes
[1:32:20] and
[1:32:21] lucifer and his angels were cast out of
[1:32:23] heaven
[1:32:24] there was no more place for them in
[1:32:26] heaven there were cats down here on
[1:32:28] earth
[1:32:29] right
[1:32:30] and that was where the trouble began
[1:32:32] yeah praise be to god amen
[1:32:35] now
[1:32:36] i'm going to fast forward because i have
[1:32:39] spent too much time
[1:32:40] already
[1:32:41] so fast forward
[1:32:43] now when
[1:32:44] when the devil calls the fall in the
[1:32:46] garden of eden
[1:32:49] the bible says
[1:32:51] the day you eat of the tree that day you
[1:32:53] will surely die
[1:32:54] yeah and satan comes and says you will
[1:32:56] not surely die
[1:32:58] but we all know the story that from the
[1:33:00] day man eight of the fruit
[1:33:02] from that day man died
[1:33:05] because a dead to god is thousand years
[1:33:08] to man
[1:33:09] and there is no man that has lived more
[1:33:11] than a thousand years before if any man
[1:33:14] ever lived beyond thousand years then
[1:33:16] that scripture is broken but scripture
[1:33:18] can never be broken
[1:33:20] praise be to god yes and from that day
[1:33:24] and while i was looking at this this
[1:33:26] something else just jumped at me
[1:33:29] and i thought we should say praise be to
[1:33:31] god amen
[1:33:33] now
[1:33:34] every man has a day to live
[1:33:38] it doesn't matter whether you live for
[1:33:40] 10 years
[1:33:41] 50 years
[1:33:42] 100 years
[1:33:44] 969 years it doesn't make any difference
[1:33:47] every human being every man has a day
[1:33:51] to live
[1:33:54] now
[1:33:55] when you look at a day
[1:33:58] a day comprises
[1:34:01] of daylight
[1:34:03] or light
[1:34:05] and then a portion of it
[1:34:07] is darkness
[1:34:08] sure
[1:34:10] now
[1:34:11] we can argue
[1:34:13] that towards the poles
[1:34:16] i have not been to
[1:34:19] norway before
[1:34:20] but i hear people talk about norway
[1:34:24] but towards the polls
[1:34:26] they can have
[1:34:27] almost 24 hours of daylight
[1:34:30] in summer right
[1:34:33] and then the night
[1:34:34] is just very short and it doesn't get
[1:34:37] very dark
[1:34:38] right
[1:34:39] we can argue that
[1:34:41] but don't also forget
[1:34:43] that when that is happening for six
[1:34:45] months there is another six months
[1:34:47] whitish are going to overturn
[1:34:49] right that they are going to be plagued
[1:34:51] with darkness yes for six months right
[1:34:56] so it brings us back
[1:34:58] yes to the same to the same place
[1:35:02] so when you take a day
[1:35:04] a day comprises of light
[1:35:07] and a portion of it
[1:35:09] is darkness there is nothing you can do
[1:35:11] about it right
[1:35:12] true very good now
[1:35:17] what's our look looking at this
[1:35:20] in every human life
[1:35:23] in every human life
[1:35:25] you have your time of sunshine
[1:35:31] and there comes a time of darkness
[1:35:36] that you wished you were never born
[1:35:39] it doesn't happen the same way like it
[1:35:42] happened to job
[1:35:43] it doesn't happen the same way to
[1:35:45] everybody
[1:35:48] job his time of sunlight
[1:35:51] when everything was so nice
[1:35:54] life was good everything was perfectly
[1:35:56] well
[1:35:58] right
[1:35:59] until
[1:36:00] his battle started
[1:36:03] and then he had to
[1:36:05] go into that night hour yes
[1:36:08] where he cursed the day he was born
[1:36:13] now when you look at the lord jesus
[1:36:15] christ
[1:36:18] he was light he is light
[1:36:21] yes the life of the world
[1:36:25] but guess what
[1:36:27] even he as the light of the world
[1:36:30] he had his time
[1:36:32] of darkness
[1:36:35] praise be to god
[1:36:37] very brother said
[1:36:43] in the message i know my redeemer
[1:36:44] leaveth
[1:36:46] the darkest hour this world ever seen
[1:36:50] was good friday
[1:36:52] when our hopes
[1:36:54] all was written
[1:36:57] all the hopes they had
[1:37:00] was what was written on paper
[1:37:03] all the hopes they had was what some
[1:37:06] philosopher had said
[1:37:08] and there was the prince of life
[1:37:11] dying at calvary it was the darkest hour
[1:37:14] the world ever seen
[1:37:16] praise be to god amen
[1:37:19] if he be in the light yes
[1:37:22] had his darkest moment
[1:37:24] right
[1:37:25] and he says
[1:37:27] if any man comes after me
[1:37:30] let him deny himself take out his cross
[1:37:33] and follow me daily you think you are
[1:37:35] going to be you you think you're going
[1:37:36] to be free
[1:37:37] no no it's not going to happen right
[1:37:40] if everything is so rosy if everything
[1:37:44] is so good if everything is falling
[1:37:47] right in place and there are no
[1:37:48] obstacles
[1:37:50] there are no battles to fight you have
[1:37:52] to question yourself
[1:37:54] that's right
[1:37:56] because the bible has made it clear
[1:37:59] that whosoever he loves he chastises
[1:38:02] right
[1:38:06] if he went through it
[1:38:08] that means
[1:38:10] we will surely go through it
[1:38:12] right
[1:38:15] yours may be in the morning
[1:38:17] yeah
[1:38:19] it may be in the afternoon
[1:38:21] it may be in the evening
[1:38:25] but always remember
[1:38:29] that a day
[1:38:30] which every man has
[1:38:32] to live
[1:38:34] it doesn't matter how long you live
[1:38:37] but you have a day to live
[1:38:41] that there is a portion of it
[1:38:44] that you wished you could maintain for
[1:38:46] the rest of your life
[1:38:48] and there is a portion of it
[1:38:50] that you would hate
[1:38:52] it never came your way
[1:38:54] right
[1:38:56] praise be to god if you never come to
[1:38:57] that point
[1:38:58] sure
[1:38:59] praise be to god
[1:39:01] because it's not a good place to be
[1:39:05] and there are moments where you would
[1:39:07] you would i mean you would ask yourself
[1:39:09] a lot of questions
[1:39:10] sure
[1:39:13] wonder whether there is anything wrong
[1:39:14] wonder whether you are walking in the
[1:39:15] wild of god wonder whether you are a
[1:39:17] child of god
[1:39:18] right
[1:39:21] but do not let the devil
[1:39:23] ever tell you otherwise
[1:39:26] know
[1:39:28] that you are a child of god
[1:39:30] fearfully and wonderfully made in the
[1:39:32] image of god
[1:39:33] praise be to god
[1:39:35] now
[1:39:46] now
[1:39:49] a seat of contest
[1:39:54] when the devil was cast out of heaven
[1:39:56] he was cast here onto this earth
[1:39:59] i know our time
[1:40:01] is almost
[1:40:02] um
[1:40:04] so i'll be i'll be very fast i'm going
[1:40:06] to summarize it
[1:40:09] praise be to god now when the devil was
[1:40:12] cast out of heaven he was cast unto the
[1:40:13] earth
[1:40:17] and he never stopped working
[1:40:20] he never stopped working the devil has
[1:40:22] never stopped working no
[1:40:24] what he didn't achieve there
[1:40:27] as a matter of fact
[1:40:28] he has achieved it here
[1:40:30] sure
[1:40:32] he has never stopped working
[1:40:35] and the devil is working overtime
[1:40:38] out of the 24 hours we have a day
[1:40:41] 24 hours we have in a day
[1:40:44] the devil is working 36 hours a day
[1:40:49] he is overworking
[1:40:51] right
[1:40:53] and out of the 24 hours we have in a day
[1:40:58] how many hours in a day
[1:41:00] do we actually seek the face of god
[1:41:03] sure
[1:41:04] do we learn to wait on god
[1:41:07] you know do we let do do we commune with
[1:41:09] god
[1:41:10] do we do we do we have time
[1:41:13] for god
[1:41:15] do we have time with god
[1:41:19] oh my god
[1:41:21] praise be to god
[1:41:23] it's not to say
[1:41:25] that the other things you are doing are
[1:41:27] not important that is not what i'm
[1:41:29] saying
[1:41:32] work is important
[1:41:34] either there's no way should know it
[1:41:36] what is important
[1:41:38] schooling is good
[1:41:40] sure
[1:41:42] education is nice
[1:41:46] if you can go to school and learn very
[1:41:47] well and work less and make more money
[1:41:50] and have more time for god that is a
[1:41:51] good thing to do sure
[1:41:54] um business is good making money is good
[1:41:58] i'm not against all that
[1:42:02] but how many
[1:42:04] how many how many hours
[1:42:06] in that 24 hours when the devil that is
[1:42:09] working against you is working over time
[1:42:12] how many of those 24 hours
[1:42:16] do you seek the face of god
[1:42:18] right
[1:42:20] how much of that 24 hours
[1:42:23] do you spend with god
[1:42:25] no
[1:42:26] is it all about you is life all about
[1:42:29] you
[1:42:35] if life is all about you
[1:42:37] then know that there is a problem
[1:42:39] somewhere yes sir
[1:42:43] when the devil was cast out of heaven
[1:42:46] he has never stopped working
[1:42:48] right
[1:42:49] now
[1:42:51] david said
[1:42:52] in sin
[1:42:53] did my mother conceive me and in
[1:42:56] iniquity was i shaping come to the world
[1:42:58] telling lies
[1:43:00] so now
[1:43:03] after the fall
[1:43:06] according to god's permissive will
[1:43:09] any man that was ever born in his flesh
[1:43:12] was born into sin
[1:43:15] right you didn't have to tell the first
[1:43:17] lie
[1:43:18] no
[1:43:19] you were born into it
[1:43:21] right
[1:43:23] so
[1:43:24] at that point
[1:43:26] the devil had complete hold
[1:43:29] of your life
[1:43:31] but in here somewhere in here
[1:43:36] was the seed of god
[1:43:38] that was lying down dormant
[1:43:41] waiting for his time of manifestation
[1:43:45] there are times and seasons
[1:43:47] yes
[1:43:48] in the kingdom of god
[1:43:51] it was just in the doormat
[1:43:53] and the devil was just pushing you here
[1:43:55] and there
[1:43:56] you didn't know who you were
[1:43:58] you were just jumping left and right
[1:44:00] center just taking you as you were smart
[1:44:03] thinking you were enjoying life sure
[1:44:07] everything was just going on
[1:44:10] now
[1:44:12] from the first time
[1:44:16] that you begin to hear the voice of god
[1:44:21] as a matter of fact sometimes you don't
[1:44:23] even know what you are hearing
[1:44:25] sure but something in you tells you that
[1:44:28] this voice is different
[1:44:31] praise be to god
[1:44:34] you know sometimes we think you have to
[1:44:36] become a christian
[1:44:40] before you see the hand of god
[1:44:42] as a matter of fact i was a muslim
[1:44:46] sure i was a muslim
[1:44:49] when i saw the hand of god
[1:44:52] that brought me from the islamic
[1:44:53] religion into christianity
[1:44:56] i have shared that dream with a lot of
[1:44:59] people
[1:45:00] i have had a lot of dreams
[1:45:04] i'm not talking of the bad ones
[1:45:07] but a lot of dreams spiritual dreams
[1:45:09] yeah and i never thought of sharing it
[1:45:12] until i went somewhere shared it and it
[1:45:14] was blessed that it blessed them so much
[1:45:16] then i thought of it
[1:45:18] but just
[1:45:19] just to talk about this i was a muslim
[1:45:21] at the time
[1:45:24] i don't know if time would even permit
[1:45:25] us praise be to god
[1:45:28] but god knows his children
[1:45:31] i mean let me just go
[1:45:33] so you know i was a muslim at the time
[1:45:37] and i was living in a compound house
[1:45:40] and those of you who come from africa
[1:45:41] you know those compound houses they
[1:45:43] build sometimes 24 rooms with one big
[1:45:46] gate and you have the toilet and a
[1:45:48] toilet and bath for men 20 and bad for
[1:45:50] women so i came out about midnight went
[1:45:53] and used the restroom and when i came
[1:45:55] back and entered the room i was not i
[1:45:58] was barely asleep
[1:46:00] i entered the room and i lay on the bed
[1:46:03] i was sliding on my back
[1:46:05] and the door opened
[1:46:07] and fire about this size
[1:46:11] just came through the door
[1:46:12] and the door closed
[1:46:14] and the fire just came straight
[1:46:16] i was lying down then i was wondering
[1:46:18] what is this i was looking at it it came
[1:46:21] so close and stopped about this distance
[1:46:26] and then i felt weight there was a
[1:46:28] weight
[1:46:29] something just pressed me to the bed
[1:46:33] and i was just lying and looking at it
[1:46:35] and then the the fire just
[1:46:38] illuminated like the headlamp of a car
[1:46:43] it was so bright and sharp i wanted to
[1:46:45] close my eyes but i saw there was a
[1:46:48] writing inside the flame
[1:46:50] so i was trying to read it
[1:46:53] while i was trying to close my eyes and
[1:46:54] i saw in that flame of fire i saw
[1:46:57] written the light
[1:47:00] and my brains just went round in my
[1:47:03] skull
[1:47:04] and i shouted jesus
[1:47:10] and then
[1:47:11] the light condensed back
[1:47:13] to its original form
[1:47:15] and then it happened again the second
[1:47:16] time my brain went right then i shouted
[1:47:19] jesus it happened three times and then
[1:47:22] when it condensed back
[1:47:24] the weight just came off me
[1:47:26] the fire just went
[1:47:28] it got to the door the door opened
[1:47:30] it went out and the door closed
[1:47:34] when i woke up i didn't sleep again
[1:47:37] right the following morning i used to
[1:47:39] have a prayer mat
[1:47:41] i went and took my bath when i came i
[1:47:43] put the prayer mouth in front of the
[1:47:44] door
[1:47:45] and i wrapped my feet on it and i
[1:47:47] entered the house
[1:47:52] so a lady saw it he said he needs to
[1:47:54] call me sadat sadat what are you doing
[1:47:57] is that your prayer mat i say yes he
[1:47:59] said
[1:48:00] he said you enter hell i said praise god
[1:48:06] so that was the end
[1:48:08] of my muslim journey
[1:48:13] sometimes you think
[1:48:15] you think that you have to start your
[1:48:17] work with god no god knows his children
[1:48:21] the way god is going to bring you in is
[1:48:24] different from the way he's going to do
[1:48:26] to somebody else
[1:48:27] but god has his eyes
[1:48:29] on his children
[1:48:32] when you are wondering who you are when
[1:48:35] you do not know who you are when you
[1:48:37] have this identity crisis going on in
[1:48:39] your mind yes sir
[1:48:41] god's eyes are upon you
[1:48:44] and in here there is that seed of life
[1:48:48] that god is keeping watch over
[1:48:51] praise be to god
[1:48:53] now oh my our time is up but you know
[1:48:56] what
[1:48:59] our time is up
[1:49:01] i knew i was not going to finish this
[1:49:02] thing
[1:49:03] praise be to god
[1:49:05] as i said it was just teaching
[1:49:08] um
[1:49:09] not nothing about so much
[1:49:12] so
[1:49:13] you know what let me just chip this in
[1:49:17] so
[1:49:18] when the devil was cast out
[1:49:22] he never stopped working
[1:49:23] right
[1:49:25] so now
[1:49:26] when you are born
[1:49:29] with that sinful nature
[1:49:32] and you come into this life
[1:49:34] the devil has so much control
[1:49:37] over your life
[1:49:39] even though you are a child of god that
[1:49:42] seed of god that representation is in
[1:49:44] here
[1:49:45] but at that point the devil has so much
[1:49:47] control over your life now when you come
[1:49:50] to the realization of who you truly are
[1:49:54] right
[1:49:56] sure when that light begins to shine in
[1:49:59] your life
[1:50:02] when that season has come
[1:50:05] for you
[1:50:06] for god to manifest himself before you
[1:50:09] and you now identified you who you truly
[1:50:12] are that you are not the man after this
[1:50:14] flesh this fallen flesh
[1:50:16] right but that
[1:50:18] you are a son or a daughter of god
[1:50:21] and you take your position amen you know
[1:50:24] what
[1:50:26] the devil gets out
[1:50:28] right yeah and when the devil is getting
[1:50:30] out
[1:50:32] god is stepping in
[1:50:33] hallelujah
[1:50:35] praise be to god amen
[1:50:37] now somewhere the bible says
[1:50:41] that when the devil goes
[1:50:43] when the devil is cast out of a man and
[1:50:45] he goes after some time he comes back
[1:50:49] to check to see this house was clean let
[1:50:53] me see
[1:50:54] is this clean and empty
[1:50:56] when it's clean and empty the bible says
[1:50:58] it's going to invite several more wicked
[1:51:00] spirits
[1:51:01] and the end of that man is going to be
[1:51:02] worse than his beginning
[1:51:04] but when he comes and he spies in there
[1:51:07] and the master is there
[1:51:09] he salutes him
[1:51:11] and then he has to run away
[1:51:13] praise be to god
[1:51:15] so what happens
[1:51:16] when the devil leaves
[1:51:18] the devil doesn't go completely
[1:51:21] when god is in the inside
[1:51:24] there is something about a man that
[1:51:27] keeps the devil so close
[1:51:29] sure
[1:51:30] this guy here
[1:51:33] this guy here can never be redeemed
[1:51:35] right right
[1:51:38] it keeps the devil so close even though
[1:51:41] god is in the inside
[1:51:44] and the devil knows he can't come in the
[1:51:46] devil can never unseat god right when
[1:51:49] god has taken over the throne
[1:51:52] when god has taken over the seats
[1:51:55] the devil can never overthrow god
[1:51:58] but do you know what the devil can do
[1:52:00] now man was created as a free moral
[1:52:03] agent
[1:52:06] you have that power in your hand that's
[1:52:07] right
[1:52:09] you can decide what you want to do
[1:52:10] that's right right
[1:52:14] if you decide to call it a quit
[1:52:18] not to have anything to do with god
[1:52:21] to give up your confidence in god your
[1:52:24] praising god
[1:52:26] then you have made way
[1:52:29] for the devil to come and occupy their
[1:52:30] sins
[1:52:32] but so long as you are holding on
[1:52:36] so long as you keep believing in god so
[1:52:38] long as you take your position
[1:52:41] i don't care what the storm brings your
[1:52:43] way
[1:52:44] the devil can never get in there
[1:52:47] but is he going to stop fighting
[1:52:49] he is never going to stop this is why
[1:52:52] the mind barrel starts yes
[1:52:55] in the greatest battle ever fought which
[1:52:58] brother branham preached
[1:53:00] the mind is the battleground yes sir why
[1:53:02] satan and god peace yes right to fight
[1:53:06] yes
[1:53:07] and
[1:53:08] you know the mind is different from the
[1:53:10] brain
[1:53:11] yeah
[1:53:13] the mind is spiritual
[1:53:15] sure the brain is physical right
[1:53:20] if you're a brain surgeon
[1:53:22] you can operate upon a man and you see
[1:53:25] their brain
[1:53:26] right but there is no way you can ever
[1:53:28] cut open a man
[1:53:29] and then you see their mind
[1:53:31] right it's spiritual right
[1:53:34] like the prophet said love is spiritual
[1:53:38] yeah you say you have love of somebody
[1:53:41] you don't see it
[1:53:42] right you can't cut open the person's
[1:53:44] heart and see oh
[1:53:46] this is how much love the person has
[1:53:48] right but you know when there is love
[1:53:50] yes
[1:53:52] so the mind
[1:53:55] is the battleground
[1:53:56] right and oh you know what
[1:54:00] yes
[1:54:01] praise be to god
[1:54:02] so
[1:54:03] now
[1:54:04] all that the devil will be throwing at
[1:54:06] you
[1:54:08] all the pain he'll be inflicting on this
[1:54:11] body
[1:54:12] sure like he did to job sure all the
[1:54:16] hardships
[1:54:18] all the sicknesses
[1:54:20] all the diseases be true
[1:54:22] or anything everything the devil brings
[1:54:24] your way
[1:54:26] he is doing it to weaken your faith
[1:54:29] to let you lose confidence in the word
[1:54:32] of god and in your protection
[1:54:36] the word is our protection right yes sir
[1:54:39] and take your mass filter
[1:54:42] the word is our protection
[1:54:44] now when you lose your confidence in the
[1:54:46] word of god what does it do
[1:54:51] you begin to turn your back on the world
[1:54:53] yes
[1:54:55] then the devil comes in
[1:54:58] when the devil inflicts you with any
[1:55:00] pain
[1:55:01] it's not because he's interested in your
[1:55:03] flesh
[1:55:06] when the devil strikes you with poverty
[1:55:09] it is not because he is interested in
[1:55:11] your flesh
[1:55:12] right
[1:55:13] when the devil strikes you with failures
[1:55:15] and disappointments it's not because
[1:55:17] he's interested in your flesh right
[1:55:20] all the fights all the war all the chaos
[1:55:23] all the storms all the problems the
[1:55:26] devil is going to bring your way it's
[1:55:28] not because he is interested in your
[1:55:30] flesh it is because he is interested in
[1:55:34] the throne
[1:55:37] there is a tron
[1:55:39] in your heart
[1:55:40] the throne of god
[1:55:42] right and god is seated on that throne
[1:55:47] the devil fought for that throne in
[1:55:49] heaven
[1:55:51] and he lost it that's right
[1:55:53] and he is cast here
[1:55:55] he has not stopped fighting for it
[1:55:58] he is still fighting for that throne
[1:56:01] there is a troop
[1:56:03] in here
[1:56:05] there is a troll
[1:56:06] a seat of contest it has become the seat
[1:56:10] of context
[1:56:11] between god
[1:56:13] and satan
[1:56:14] yes it has nothing to do with you
[1:56:19] the battle is not your battle no the
[1:56:22] battle is the lost battle
[1:56:24] stay still

[1:57:12] yes
[1:57:13] you are just in the middle
[1:57:14] you happy to be the battleground
[1:57:17] where they meet
[1:57:19] sometimes you just get up
[1:57:22] you know you are not sick but then you
[1:57:24] know you are not well
[1:57:28] praise the lord
[1:57:29] if they ask you what is going on you
[1:57:31] can't even tell what is going on
[1:57:33] sure
[1:57:34] suddenly something is going on right
[1:57:36] right
[1:57:38] you don't just have to know everything
[1:57:40] you can't understand everything yeah
[1:57:43] oh my god i know time was going to go
[1:57:45] against us tonight
[1:57:48] yes i knew about it so i'm not taken by
[1:57:50] surprise at all
[1:57:51] but
[1:57:52] let me see if i can just chip in another
[1:57:54] thing
[1:58:03] our time is a
[1:58:05] any musicians come
[1:58:08] so remember
[1:58:12] a seat of contest
[1:58:15] there is a true
[1:58:18] in your heart
[1:58:22] and as i said that every throne has some
[1:58:24] form of fortification
[1:58:27] so are you fortified yes
[1:58:30] the word of god is our fortification yes
[1:58:33] sir
[1:58:34] you are fortified
[1:58:37] that the devil cannot just come and
[1:58:38] intrude on you right
[1:58:41] you are completely fortified yes sir
[1:58:47] and when the devil is coming around
[1:58:51] know
[1:58:53] that the holy spirit is keeping the
[1:58:55] devil in check
[1:58:58] the holy spirit is keeping the devil on
[1:59:01] strict surveillance
[1:59:04] every move the devil makes
[1:59:05] [Music]
[1:59:07] the eyes of god are upon him
[1:59:09] [Music]
[1:59:15] just make sure
[1:59:17] that you don't get outside the fortified
[1:59:20] zone
[1:59:21] don't get out of the world
[1:59:26] the only way the devil can get you if
[1:59:29] the devil can get you to forsake the
[1:59:31] world
[1:59:32] to lead the fortification of the word
[1:59:34] then the devil has control over your
[1:59:35] life
[1:59:38] but if you stay true to the word
[1:59:41] even when you are down
[1:59:46] even when you are down
[1:59:48] when you are on your knees
[1:59:50] when you are on your back
[1:59:52] when you know that you have come to your
[1:59:55] wit's end
[1:59:56] and there is nothing you can do
[1:59:59] but you are still holding on to the word
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:03] you are fortified
[2:00:06] praise be to god
[2:00:08] [Music]
[2:00:10] we ought to esteem the word of god more
[2:00:13] necessary than our daily bread
[2:00:17] praise be to god
[2:00:20] for men shall not live by bread alone
[2:00:22] amen but by every word
[2:00:25] that proceedeth
[2:00:26] out of the mouth of god
[2:00:29] your soul
[2:00:31] feeds on nothing
[2:00:37] when you stay away
[2:00:40] from the world you are denying your soul
[2:00:44] of his food
[2:00:45] you are starving your soul
[2:00:49] just think about it
[2:00:51] when you go 24 hours without food how
[2:00:54] you feel sure
[2:00:57] you go 24 hours without the vegas
[2:01:01] without the rice
[2:01:04] how do you feel
[2:01:06] and sometimes we can stop our souls
[2:01:09] for days and weeks and months and years
[2:01:14] lord have mercy
[2:01:17] i want us to go before the lord we are
[2:01:19] far behind time sorry for keeping you
[2:01:21] too late
[2:01:22] yes
[2:01:23] sorry i am
[2:01:26] praise be to god
[2:01:28] i believe the lord may have spoken to
[2:01:29] somebody
[2:01:31] praise be to god

[2:01:35] so i want us to go before the lord in
[2:01:36] prayer

[2:01:45] tonight
[2:01:46] but i want us to go before the lord just

[2:01:53] of contest
