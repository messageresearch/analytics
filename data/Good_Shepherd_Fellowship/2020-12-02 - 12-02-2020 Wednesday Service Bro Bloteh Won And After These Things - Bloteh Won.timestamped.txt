[48:44] father
[48:45] uh pray the lord you just just help us
[48:48] tonight oh god us
[48:50] we would just look into your word and
[48:52] pray that you come and give us grace
[48:55] come speak to us lord in a way that when

[49:28] the lord god unimportant reyneth
[49:32] now when you look into this uh uh
[49:36] uh revelation chapter 19
[49:40] and we just read uh out of these verses
[49:44] i'm kind of running my mind true to be
[49:47] show
[49:47] because uh i think i see uh
[49:51] hallelujah in verse one and hallelujah
[49:53] in verse three
[49:55] and i see amen hallelujah in verse 4
[49:59] praise the lord and i see uh
[50:02] hallelujah for the lord god unimportant
[50:05] reigneth
[50:06] and that is in verse 6. are you seeing
[50:09] any other hallelujah
[50:12] amen if you're looking through your
[50:15] bibles write
[50:16] right in there is there any other
[50:18] hallelujah
[50:20] praise the lord if you find any you let
[50:22] me know amen
[50:24] but i think there is four hallelujah
[50:26] right in the passage there
[50:28] now uh i want to speak a little bit on
[50:31] the subject i would just i'll just give
[50:33] you a title here from verse one
[50:35] and after these things after these
[50:38] things after one
[50:39] thing now this this will also help us to
[50:42] see
[50:43] that when the bible was written
[50:46] originally it was not written
[50:48] in chapters like we have amen
[50:52] it was a straw so it was just
[50:55] written on it was just written
[50:58] on because uh in in a good in in a good
[51:01] english setting after these things
[51:04] gave you an idea for you to look back
[51:08] so after these stains nobody start a
[51:10] letter saying after these things
[51:12] the next question they will ask what
[51:14] things
[51:16] praise the lord so uh uh
[51:20] it was it was over over a certain amount
[51:24] of years i was looking at some of the
[51:25] history today
[51:27] and of where the bible was actually put
[51:29] into chapters and verses
[51:32] just to be able to to to help us
[51:39] that we will not get bored just just
[51:42] reading this straw
[51:43] you know uh just on and on
[51:47] so uh uh they put it into into chapters
[51:50] and verses
[51:51] but after these things now after
[51:55] walking after destruct the destruction
[51:59] of the great hall the last time we run a
[52:02] parallel with babylon
[52:04] and the new jerusalem and
[52:07] [Music]
[52:10] but you you will see here that
[52:15] john said after these things
[52:18] after after the destruction of rome
[52:22] after the destruction of that of that
[52:25] great dragon
[52:26] after the destruction you know of that
[52:29] of that hallowed church then
[52:34] the apostle john says i heard a
[52:37] great voice of much people
[52:40] saying hallelujah
[52:44] salvation and glory and honor and power
[52:49] unto the lord our god
[52:52] amen i mean sometimes i mean we just
[52:56] we just sign that song and and and we
[52:59] have to sing it again
[53:00] and we have to sing it again just to
[53:02] wake you up to say hallelujah and we
[53:04] have to sing it again
[53:06] just to get you a little bit into the
[53:08] music and we have to sing it again
[53:10] [Laughter]
[53:12] praise the lord now is is is
[53:15] there is no way we can we can really be
[53:18] able to put in our mind
[53:20] what this scene or the the expression of
[53:23] this sin
[53:24] you know the the the the rejoicing
[53:29] of these people that is having this
[53:31] expression
[53:32] that john is describing here hallelujah
[53:36] salvation glory honor and power
[53:38] unto our god praise the lord
[53:42] and just like i said the last time there
[53:45] is no way
[53:46] that you can be able to really
[53:49] imagine what it will be to be
[53:53] completely free from sin
[53:58] praise the lord amen
[54:02] you know you give your heart to the lord
[54:04] and and and you
[54:06] you you get a little taste of that honey
[54:09] on the rock and you just think oh
[54:11] my goodness oh god it's so good to me
[54:14] you read
[54:14] the bible you cried and and and you
[54:17] praise the lord and
[54:18] and it looks like everything and then
[54:21] and then and then
[54:22] not too long the battle stats amen
[54:26] praise the lord the battle starting
[54:29] and things start going you know crazy oh
[54:32] my goodness what is this
[54:35] praise the lord and and and you know
[54:38] uh uh uh you know is is is is
[54:42] jesus said as asks the father anything
[54:45] in my name is
[54:46] you know you just feel like uh uh you
[54:49] know it's
[54:49] it's it's just like your athlete dad you
[54:52] you're running to him and
[54:53] and you ask him and they expect him to
[54:55] give it to you right now
[54:56] you know and then you prayed and and and
[54:59] and god started teaching you
[55:00] to wait and and patient and he started
[55:03] teaching you different things
[55:05] and and pretty soon you know you have
[55:08] the
[55:09] the the test of your faith you know and
[55:12] and
[55:12] and then as you go on you realize that
[55:15] you know you you slip
[55:16] and fall you miss you you make mistake
[55:19] you say things that you're not supposed
[55:21] to say you regret
[55:22] and and trust comes to your mind you
[55:24] feel bad about it
[55:26] and then that god in his mercy come
[55:28] around and
[55:29] and and and give you a revival amen
[55:32] no matter how he did it whether it is in
[55:34] the preaching service whether it is in
[55:36] your house
[55:37] whether you know whatever it is god
[55:39] comes around and he gives you a special
[55:42] touch
[55:43] and it's almost like you get on fire
[55:45] again praise the lord
[55:46] devil i don't care whatever you do to me
[55:48] oh satan
[55:49] you cannot make it with me god is on my
[55:51] side i mean you get so revived
[55:56] and then as the week goes on again the
[55:57] battle gets tough oh god help me jesus
[56:00] oh jesus
[56:01] oh my goodness help me a lot praise the
[56:04] lord
[56:06] amen
[56:13] then you read a book or you listen to a
[56:15] song or you you come to a service and
[56:17] and and the grace of god comes and pick
[56:19] you up again and you drum in the spirit
[56:21] you are worshiping you are so happy
[56:23] shouting to the top of it hallelujah
[56:25] praise the lord
[56:27] and then after a couple of weeks again
[56:29] the battle goes on
[56:32] the enemy comes around to frustrate you
[56:34] and out of there and
[56:35] on and on and on and on
[56:38] but to know that there is coming a day
[56:43] praise the lord there is coming a day
[56:47] where the last evil thought will come
[56:51] praise the lord the last
[56:55] doubt will flow through your mind
[56:59] there's coming a day where the last time
[57:02] you have to choose your words
[57:07] praise the lord now so when you look
[57:10] right here the reason why
[57:12] i was counting those hallelujah because
[57:14] we know 40 is the number of deliverance
[57:16] amen
[57:17] that's just why i was counting it
[57:20] because that was just what was on my
[57:21] mind
[57:22] you know it's it's an expression of
[57:24] deliverance
[57:27] is an expression of deliverance
[57:31] finally
[57:34] finally we have come to this place
[57:39] much people in heaven saying hallelujah
[57:42] salvation
[57:44] glory honor power
[57:48] i mean salvation means to be
[57:52] safe
[57:55] he has that greek word sozo
[57:58] brother branham said he said do what i
[58:00] to mean
[58:01] it has to do with the saving of your
[58:03] soul and the healing of your body
[58:08] we can say that we are safe
[58:11] safe from sin saved from sicknesses
[58:15] praise the lord hallelujah
[58:20] and all of that just because finally
[58:24] finally finally
[58:27] this thing that god allowed
[58:31] to manifest his attribute is now
[58:35] being destroyed
[58:39] amen
[58:44] it started as a spirit it moves on
[58:48] it became a kingdom and it moves on
[58:51] it became a religion it moves on
[58:54] it entered into politics it became the
[58:58] evil of the word that troubled the word
[59:02] in every way
[59:04] in every form of evil you can trace it
[59:07] right back to this
[59:11] every form of evil you can trace it
[59:15] right back to this
[59:20] praise the lord amen
[59:23] amen now the reason why
[59:28] i'm going this way you will you will see
[59:31] as we go along
[59:32] a little bit and uh uh
[59:35] you know all during the week i've been
[59:38] having
[59:39] this thought on my mind i've been having
[59:40] that song in my mind
[59:42] i've just been kind of for imagining you
[59:45] know uh
[59:46] uh i mean this this kind of for worship
[59:49] verse uh six again and i heard
[59:52] uh a word a voice of a great multitude
[59:57] and as the voice of many waters
[1:00:01] and as the voice of a mighty thundering
[1:00:04] saying hallelujah for
[1:00:09] the lord god unimportant rinith
[1:00:13] praise the lord amen
[1:00:19] when we get into this celebration praise
[1:00:22] the lord
[1:00:24] we get into this celebration here i mean
[1:00:27] it's it's awaiting us
[1:00:29] each and every one of us will come to
[1:00:31] that place where we can express that
[1:00:33] hallelujah
[1:00:34] i don't care how you try to express it
[1:00:36] now it will never be like
[1:00:38] it is written down here this expression
[1:00:42] is going to have a different feeling
[1:00:45] that you have never known
[1:00:48] it's not only going to be a shout it's
[1:00:51] not just going to be a shout
[1:00:54] it's going to be a feeling that would go
[1:00:58] through your body praise the lord
[1:01:01] we can look forward to it amen if there
[1:01:04] is one thing we can look forward to in
[1:01:06] our future is this expression
[1:01:09] is is is uh is the fulfillment of this
[1:01:14] praise the lord amen
[1:01:19] amen i believe even like paul says if
[1:01:23] this effortless tabernacle be dissolved
[1:01:26] he says there is another one within us
[1:01:29] now
[1:01:29] if if if a sin the brother or the sister
[1:01:32] is down with some kind of a sickness
[1:01:35] and and they die they step
[1:01:38] into their new body praise the lord
[1:01:41] but even their body that they step into
[1:01:44] even though they don't feel
[1:01:45] no pain no sickness they will they are
[1:01:48] still
[1:01:49] not at the place to have this expression
[1:01:55] praise the lord they are they they are
[1:01:58] not yet at the place to have this
[1:02:00] expression
[1:02:01] now the reason why i said that is
[1:02:04] because
[1:02:06] we know that uh is uh
[1:02:10] uh uh you know we we we leave this body
[1:02:14] and we go into uh uh
[1:02:17] a celestial body okay and as we go into
[1:02:21] the celestial body
[1:02:23] uh uh you know and and we go into a
[1:02:26] glorified body
[1:02:27] but brother branham says something i
[1:02:29] mean this this just captured my mind and
[1:02:31] i'm just saying this
[1:02:32] to be able to come back to my notes i
[1:02:34] hope i can get
[1:02:36] uh uh okay i still have a few minutes
[1:02:38] that you have to share with you what i
[1:02:39] want
[1:02:39] really want to share with you tonight
[1:02:42] and uh brother branham said
[1:02:45] he said uh
[1:02:50] this body that we
[1:02:53] that we are that we have in a way that
[1:02:56] we are made as
[1:02:57] humans okay the prophet of god said
[1:03:02] we will never be angers
[1:03:05] we will always be humans
[1:03:09] amen he says the reason why the saints
[1:03:12] on the altar were saying how long
[1:03:16] how long even though the scripture says
[1:03:20] they were saying how long
[1:03:22] because they wanted to revenge now
[1:03:25] brother branham that that's a beautiful
[1:03:27] way when you when you follow the way
[1:03:29] that god
[1:03:30] you know uh help the prophet to be able
[1:03:32] to to to talk about the scripture
[1:03:34] he says in for the fact of the
[1:03:38] day expressing revenge he says
[1:03:42] it was it was there to show that they
[1:03:45] were not
[1:03:46] gentiles they were jews
[1:03:51] just by that expression
[1:03:54] so that is not the only interpretation
[1:03:56] to that
[1:03:59] because he said the reason why they were
[1:04:02] saying how long
[1:04:03] is because they wanted to come from out
[1:04:06] of a celestial body
[1:04:08] to a terrestrial body amen
[1:04:14] that they can they can be they can be in
[1:04:16] the body like this
[1:04:17] that like we have here praise the lord
[1:04:23] are we together amen you think about it
[1:04:26] beyond the curtain of time
[1:04:28] brother branham says uh you know uh he
[1:04:30] his brother was there on
[1:04:32] uh uh you know on the bed he was there
[1:04:34] you know hawking those people
[1:04:36] my beloved brother my beloved sister you
[1:04:39] know and it was just a wonderful feeling
[1:04:41] it was a you know it was a beautiful
[1:04:43] feeling but
[1:04:44] it was yet in another body
[1:04:49] that is the body that we are kept in
[1:04:53] that is the body
[1:04:55] souls under the altars are kept in that
[1:04:58] body
[1:04:59] we there we are not just a spirit that
[1:05:01] would be ruling around we have a body
[1:05:03] but yet it is not like this body
[1:05:10] are we together amen now so he said
[1:05:14] there he says uh uh they wanted to come
[1:05:17] back to this body
[1:05:19] and they wanted they wanted to have
[1:05:23] food and water
[1:05:26] praise the lord amen i'm kind of for
[1:05:29] teasing you tonight
[1:05:30] i will i will actually go into that
[1:05:32] subject and bring a lot of material for
[1:05:34] you to look at
[1:05:34] talking about a different kind of a body
[1:05:37] but the reason why i'm saying it is that
[1:05:40] uh even when we when we get when we
[1:05:42] leave from here and get
[1:05:43] into our celestial body we still
[1:05:47] does not have the expression that is
[1:05:49] here
[1:05:52] because we were not tempted
[1:05:55] in our celestial body
[1:05:59] amen we were not tempted in our
[1:06:01] celestial body
[1:06:02] you have to come to a terrestrial body
[1:06:05] and be free from sin
[1:06:08] to know the difference
[1:06:11] am i making sense praise the lord
[1:06:14] you will say oh brother one but this
[1:06:16] body is
[1:06:17] is is is a corruptable body
[1:06:21] it's corruptable because of the same
[1:06:24] nature we are honored
[1:06:27] when god takes the same nature away
[1:06:31] amen when he takes that same nature
[1:06:35] just like in the millennium satan will
[1:06:37] be bound for the thousand years
[1:06:40] we will still be in a terrestrial body
[1:06:42] but it will be a different feeling
[1:06:46] you see that is the reason why right
[1:06:48] after the right after the thousand years
[1:06:52] my goodness when satan is released
[1:06:55] the saints are going to bounce back my
[1:06:58] goodness
[1:06:58] after we have enjoyed freedom
[1:07:02] then you're coming back to tell us no
[1:07:03] we're ready to fight this time
[1:07:05] [Laughter]
[1:07:09] praise the lord after we have enjoyed
[1:07:13] living one thousand year without evil
[1:07:15] thought
[1:07:16] no lust no headache
[1:07:20] then satan is released to come and tempt
[1:07:23] us
[1:07:25] there is no there is no two thousand it
[1:07:28] i'm going to fight him i will bite him
[1:07:30] [Laughter]
[1:07:34] [Applause]
[1:07:36] praise the lord
[1:07:40] amen
[1:07:43] let me just run you quickly through what
[1:07:46] i want to share with you tonight
[1:07:48] amen that was just an exhortation
[1:07:51] i'm looking forward for the really
[1:07:55] pie hallelujah you know he says
[1:07:58] you says you know i at kennedy church
[1:08:01] says
[1:08:02] praise the lord praise the lord can the
[1:08:04] church says hallelujah hallelujah is
[1:08:10] nothing expression here
[1:08:14] hallelujah salvation glory honor
[1:08:17] is still not the expression
[1:08:21] amen i'm not even hit 10 percent yet
[1:08:25] of this of the reality of this
[1:08:28] i'm just working out myself
[1:08:31] i walk myself up now until i'm feeling
[1:08:33] hot
[1:08:34] but it's okay
[1:08:39] but it's going to be a different thing
[1:08:42] it's going to be
[1:08:43] a different thing when you get back in
[1:08:46] your celestial body
[1:08:48] and you realize you realize
[1:08:55] that there is no evil
[1:08:59] you realize that there is no evil
[1:09:04] i love the way isaiah said it
[1:09:07] he said even the food will not earth
[1:09:09] [Laughter]
[1:09:12] okay let's let's just get to something
[1:09:14] tonight praise the lord
[1:09:16] now as i run this parallel there was
[1:09:18] something i was looking at
[1:09:21] we want to thank the law for the service
[1:09:23] we had with brother andrews that was a
[1:09:25] good service amen
[1:09:26] that was a good thanksgiving service and
[1:09:29] we had
[1:09:30] brother ortiz came in to see us and and
[1:09:33] he preached for
[1:09:34] us this gun sunday that was also a good
[1:09:36] service amen
[1:09:37] now so i want to look i want to take
[1:09:39] something here
[1:09:40] a couple of weeks ago as i was looking
[1:09:43] at all of these uh
[1:09:45] uh uh you know i was i was doing a
[1:09:47] parallel
[1:09:48] with babylon in in in in jerusalem
[1:09:54] i started looking at you know the time
[1:09:57] that we are living in
[1:09:58] and you know in in the hour that we are
[1:10:00] living in talking about
[1:10:02] that great woman a great halloween
[1:10:05] and so as i was looking at that i got
[1:10:09] i got a bit caught up into brother
[1:10:11] branham 7 vision so i started working on
[1:10:14] something
[1:10:15] that i entitled 1933
[1:10:19] and uh but then
[1:10:23] which of course that's what i thought i
[1:10:25] was going to speak on tonight i was i i
[1:10:27] decided to work on 1933
[1:10:30] 1965 and 1977.
[1:10:35] and but then uh
[1:10:39] when brother autist preached on sunday
[1:10:41] he he started dealing with their quote
[1:10:44] that had to do with the seventh vision
[1:10:46] you know because he was telling us uh uh
[1:10:49] you know uh uh reminding us of what a
[1:10:52] prophet has said
[1:10:54] is that what he preached yes amen yeah
[1:10:57] uh so uh
[1:10:59] but why he was saying that i
[1:11:02] felt in myself as he was reading that
[1:11:04] code and which of course it happens over
[1:11:06] and over
[1:11:08] when when people start reading about the
[1:11:10] seventh vision and and it comes down to
[1:11:13] brother branham prediction about 1977
[1:11:17] there is always
[1:11:20] a strange feeling praise the lord
[1:11:24] amen because of all that we have heard
[1:11:28] about 1977 or what we have heard
[1:11:31] that people have made out of 1977
[1:11:36] you know so so
[1:11:40] i i i mean i was sitting right there
[1:11:42] where the uh
[1:11:43] uh where young brother simon is sitting
[1:11:45] in and uh
[1:11:46] you know uh and and you know and being a
[1:11:49] pastor
[1:11:50] you know when the people are pulling
[1:11:52] even if i'm not preaching
[1:11:54] i can feel when there is resentment in
[1:11:56] the building
[1:11:58] praise the lord i said there i'm
[1:12:01] listening to the service
[1:12:02] and sometimes i get i told brother
[1:12:04] andrews after
[1:12:06] after sunday night i told him i said
[1:12:07] brother i don't know if it is just me
[1:12:09] but sometimes a different minister
[1:12:11] preach and i get
[1:12:12] tired i feel more tired
[1:12:19] i feel more tired and and and you know
[1:12:22] the different preachers will tell you
[1:12:23] the same
[1:12:24] you know because uh uh you sit there you
[1:12:27] are you are receiving the word but also
[1:12:29] you are praying for the people
[1:12:31] to be able to receive the word you know
[1:12:34] you are praying for the people you're
[1:12:36] praying for different individuals to be
[1:12:38] able to grab what the holy spirit is
[1:12:40] saying
[1:12:41] you know the preacher will say something
[1:12:43] you say lord i wish this young man would
[1:12:45] just grab
[1:12:46] that no so i sat there
[1:12:50] and as i was uh uh
[1:12:52] [Music]
[1:12:53] uh you know listening to that i got that
[1:12:56] feeling
[1:12:57] so i said well okay it looks like i have
[1:12:59] to jump over
[1:13:01] and and look at this uh my 1977
[1:13:05] presentation that i wanted to do now i
[1:13:08] was
[1:13:08] i was actually i'm i'm having i'm having
[1:13:11] uh you know some of my notes somewhere i
[1:13:14] was i was actually going to i started
[1:13:17] putting images
[1:13:18] to some other things i was going to say
[1:13:20] i'm not
[1:13:21] i'm not you know very good uh
[1:13:24] uh slide i don't do very good slide
[1:13:28] presentation because i quit to get
[1:13:29] distracted
[1:13:31] you know i might be saying one thing and
[1:13:33] i just leave and just go my way
[1:13:36] so uh but that's what i thought i would
[1:13:39] do tonight
[1:13:40] i said sir we had these prayer requests
[1:13:42] to pray about these needs
[1:13:44] i says what i'll exalt the people a
[1:13:45] little bit on on
[1:13:47] on revelation chapter 19
[1:13:51] and what i would do is that i will go
[1:13:54] through
[1:13:55] a few quotes on on 1977
[1:13:58] and and see if the holy spirit will help
[1:14:00] us to to
[1:14:02] you know to to to come together there's
[1:14:04] one thing i will say to you as a church
[1:14:06] and as your pastor
[1:14:08] i've i've never i've never believed you
[1:14:11] know
[1:14:12] even being a young man i never believed
[1:14:14] that
[1:14:15] anybody won't let me say it this way
[1:14:17] first
[1:14:18] god do not vindicate a man
[1:14:22] god do not vinnicate god will never
[1:14:24] vindicate this flesh
[1:14:27] god vindicate his word
[1:14:32] if you watch brother branham ministry he
[1:14:35] will say
[1:14:37] if if all that i've said to you is the
[1:14:40] truth
[1:14:44] he will say if all that i've said to you
[1:14:47] is the truth
[1:14:49] god will vindicate it by coming
[1:14:56] and discerning your needs
[1:14:59] so god coming in the discernment
[1:15:02] was not for brother branham it was to
[1:15:06] vindicate
[1:15:07] the word that he has preached
[1:15:11] god do not vindicate a man
[1:15:16] praise the lord and if god do not
[1:15:19] vindicate a man
[1:15:20] then there is no man that can vandicate
[1:15:22] another man
[1:15:26] praise the lord amen
[1:15:31] and sometimes there's other place where
[1:15:33] it looks like we
[1:15:34] we we we tried to to to
[1:15:38] to prove or vindicate that brother
[1:15:40] brandon was a prophet
[1:15:41] it's not your work you can't do it
[1:15:49] god do not vindicate a man
[1:15:53] praise the lord i think what
[1:15:56] our problem is is is when you take
[1:16:00] a dictionary definition of vindication
[1:16:03] vindication is used
[1:16:05] in court if i'm right sister heavy it's
[1:16:07] a word that is using caught a lot
[1:16:09] you know and uh uh
[1:16:13] you know uh uh
[1:16:16] you and and in the way that those words
[1:16:20] are used which of course in the context
[1:16:24] at the time is right but when it comes
[1:16:27] to
[1:16:28] divine things when it comes to
[1:16:31] structural things
[1:16:33] is completely different
[1:16:37] are we together amen god
[1:16:41] dedicates his word
[1:16:45] praise the lord amen
[1:16:48] so uh uh that that that is something
[1:16:52] that
[1:16:52] you know we we have to we have to
[1:16:56] we have to we have to learn we have to
[1:16:58] tell ourselves
[1:16:59] because i've heard people say that over
[1:17:01] and over you know god will vindicate me
[1:17:03] god don't bend and get a man
[1:17:08] praise the lord god vindicate his word
[1:17:14] amen when god moves on the scene because
[1:17:17] you were there or because you said
[1:17:19] something it is something that you say
[1:17:21] that pleases him
[1:17:26] when brother branham says heatherwise
[1:17:27] you said the right thing
[1:17:31] it was not only because that
[1:17:36] you know that she believed in brother
[1:17:37] branham
[1:17:41] but she says something that please god
[1:17:47] so god came down and vindicated himself
[1:17:52] vindicated that what happened that what
[1:17:54] my servant is telling you that happened
[1:17:56] back there
[1:17:58] it's true
[1:18:03] are we together now so
[1:18:08] i know many of us you know we were
[1:18:12] either little now born
[1:18:13] at a time or uh you know uh uh
[1:18:16] not in the message i know brother scat
[1:18:19] and his wife says
[1:18:20] now i mean they lived through that time
[1:18:22] of 1977
[1:18:25] and it's good to have them as a witness
[1:18:29] to
[1:18:29] i mean to tell us what it was like being
[1:18:32] a believer
[1:18:33] after 1977 with with many of the things
[1:18:36] that people
[1:18:37] taught about what 1977 was
[1:18:40] so i would take i would just take my
[1:18:42] time i would run through
[1:18:45] my coach tonight condemnation by
[1:18:48] representation 1960
[1:18:51] now remember that's what the law
[1:18:54] show but i predict this will take place
[1:18:58] before 1977. upon this
[1:19:02] prediction i base because of their
[1:19:05] unreached slot that's coming up
[1:19:09] i want you to underline that or if you
[1:19:11] want to write it down you can write it
[1:19:12] down
[1:19:13] because of their own rushing slot
[1:19:16] that's coming now how fast
[1:19:21] that it was moving how long it will take
[1:19:25] till this nation meet his place
[1:19:28] different thing he was talking about
[1:19:30] talking about all the divisions now so
[1:19:33] this is the picture brother branham had
[1:19:36] seven vision in 1933. are we together
[1:19:40] amen he has seven vision in 1933
[1:19:45] and and and those vision mesology
[1:19:48] and just like uh baroque says hitler
[1:19:52] you know and and and you know and and
[1:19:54] and
[1:19:55] and those things were fulfilling now
[1:19:58] in the way that they were fulfilling you
[1:20:01] know
[1:20:02] coming to pass and things that were
[1:20:05] happening
[1:20:07] brother branham brings this prediction
[1:20:10] of 1977 praise the lord
[1:20:14] are we together and uh and
[1:20:17] and and and that's what i want us to see
[1:20:20] i
[1:20:20] want us as as as christians i want us
[1:20:24] as as as believers i'm saying that
[1:20:27] now that we are not believers i'm saying
[1:20:30] it because
[1:20:31] we as christians and believers we are
[1:20:34] students of the scriptures
[1:20:37] amen we have been taught by the lord and
[1:20:40] the lord teaches us by his word
[1:20:42] we are student of the scriptures are we
[1:20:46] together
[1:20:46] so that's the reason why i'm trying to
[1:20:48] draw your attention
[1:20:50] so you can be able to see this because
[1:20:52] we are living
[1:20:54] in a dual world we have a physical world
[1:20:56] we got to go to work we got to go to
[1:20:58] school
[1:20:59] but yet we have a spiritual life to look
[1:21:01] over amen
[1:21:02] we look for the promises of god they are
[1:21:04] not in the newspaper amen
[1:21:06] the promises of god don't come on the
[1:21:08] internet the promises of god is in his
[1:21:10] word
[1:21:11] and god have a time that he fulfilled
[1:21:13] him are we together
[1:21:16] praise the lord
[1:21:20] so brother branham is talking about he
[1:21:22] says
[1:21:23] he says i'm basing this because of the
[1:21:26] unrushing slot
[1:21:28] that is coming how fast the way things
[1:21:31] were happening
[1:21:33] so he's basing this seven vision
[1:21:38] to be fulfilled at this time are we
[1:21:42] together
[1:21:43] now you watch the language as we go
[1:21:45] along
[1:21:46] amen i know this is i mean there's no
[1:21:49] time for the wednesday night to do this
[1:21:51] but
[1:21:51] i i i'm i'm intentionally doing this so
[1:21:55] maybe i could
[1:21:56] keep you off thinking a little bit
[1:21:57] through the night or praying amen
[1:22:00] but uh ephesian church age look at this
[1:22:03] one
[1:22:03] closely it would give us maybe the uh uh
[1:22:07] the law might help us to be able to look
[1:22:09] at this closely
[1:22:10] and see he says after the efficient
[1:22:12] church age he says from
[1:22:14] 80 53 until 80 70 then
[1:22:18] he went to the next church age sister
[1:22:20] faith if you can just drop down
[1:22:22] to the uh
[1:22:26] laodicea church age or philadelphia
[1:22:29] he he goes through the different years
[1:22:31] of the church ages
[1:22:33] and he says here and from 1750
[1:22:36] on the next age come in was the
[1:22:40] philadelphia
[1:22:41] the philadelphian he says wesley age he
[1:22:44] says
[1:22:45] that began at 19 i mean 1750
[1:22:48] and last till 1906.
[1:22:52] and at 1906 the laudition church is
[1:22:56] set in and i don't know
[1:23:00] when it will end but i predict
[1:23:05] it will be done by
[1:23:08] 1977. now so where i would draw your
[1:23:12] mind to a little bit and i want you
[1:23:14] to to catch this is that
[1:23:19] brother branham is talking about
[1:23:23] the age praise the lord
[1:23:28] is completely different than talking
[1:23:30] about the end of the word
[1:23:34] okay because this word does not have a
[1:23:38] full stop
[1:23:40] we will continue to have events
[1:23:42] happening
[1:23:44] after the rapture there will be events
[1:23:47] taking place
[1:23:48] one evening will lead to another event
[1:23:53] but he's trying to grab our attention
[1:23:56] for us to see
[1:23:58] in the age for us to see uh an
[1:24:02] age or or a dispensation if i would say
[1:24:05] like that
[1:24:06] not really but just to be able to look
[1:24:08] at an inch bracket
[1:24:09] let me say that way now let's look at
[1:24:12] another
[1:24:12] another one here
[1:24:16] praise the lord now edition church age
[1:24:18] he says
[1:24:19] and i believe the loud jesus started 80
[1:24:22] 1906.
[1:24:23] he says i predict now remember predict
[1:24:26] especially you listening at the tape
[1:24:28] i don't i don't say it will be
[1:24:33] but predate that it will end
[1:24:36] by 1977 that the church will go
[1:24:40] completely into apostle saying
[1:24:45] what is that the rejection of the holy
[1:24:48] spirit
[1:24:50] the church will go completely
[1:24:53] into apostle saying
[1:24:58] we together amen
[1:25:01] and if you if you go back to history
[1:25:04] and uh and and even through the message
[1:25:06] you will realize
[1:25:08] that that brother branham told he told
[1:25:11] uh
[1:25:12] uh where is this brother named
[1:25:16] uh willem he was he was the the the
[1:25:18] pentecostal man there
[1:25:20] uh in uh choosing of a bride
[1:25:24] the ones whose uh uh
[1:25:28] sister uh prophesy during the message
[1:25:31] his
[1:25:32] name slipping my mind uh
[1:25:37] what is his name now
[1:25:45] i would get his name as i go along here
[1:25:47] but brother branham told him
[1:25:49] you know that uh he was going to be
[1:25:53] called
[1:25:54] mr pentecost
[1:25:58] demonstrate karen thank you the name
[1:26:01] demise
[1:26:02] i was thinking about paul was just on my
[1:26:04] mind demonstrating
[1:26:05] brother brahm told him he was going to
[1:26:06] be called mr pentecost
[1:26:09] you know and and uh
[1:26:12] and he told him that that will be just
[1:26:15] exactly
[1:26:16] at a time where penny costs her will go
[1:26:19] back to her mother
[1:26:22] and therefore that took place in 1970
[1:26:29] are we together amen
[1:26:33] now so i mean uh uh
[1:26:36] uh uh
[1:26:39] jeremiah came on the scene and told
[1:26:41] israel that we're going into babylon
[1:26:44] for 70 years that's what he told
[1:26:47] in the book of jeremiah he got slapped
[1:26:50] in the face by zedekiah he says it will
[1:26:52] only be seven years it's not going to be
[1:26:54] seven god will not be cruel
[1:26:56] to keep us down there for 70 years
[1:27:00] when god gave the dream to to down here
[1:27:04] concerning their 70 years when daniel
[1:27:07] break out the 70 years
[1:27:09] it was it was more than just literally
[1:27:12] 70 years a
[1:27:15] spun over a period of time which of
[1:27:18] course
[1:27:18] we are staying in the bracket of the 70
[1:27:21] years
[1:27:22] are we together as children of god
[1:27:27] what we have to understand that god do
[1:27:30] not
[1:27:31] live in our time zone
[1:27:34] god is out of our time
[1:27:37] because he is internal
[1:27:41] amen being in tenor he can
[1:27:44] come into our time zone he can come out
[1:27:49] but he's out of our time zone
[1:27:53] that's the reason why it does not bother
[1:27:56] him
[1:27:57] what is happening because he knows the
[1:27:59] end from the beginning
[1:28:04] are we together amen
[1:28:08] god told he told
[1:28:12] abraham after 400 years i would come
[1:28:17] down with a mighty hand
[1:28:19] and i would bring them out that's why he
[1:28:22] told abraham
[1:28:24] praise the lord uh uh
[1:28:29] uh testimony of a true witness
[1:28:34] brother abraham said because at the time
[1:28:37] moses
[1:28:37] came the bible said paul said that he
[1:28:39] was born a proper child he came right on
[1:28:42] time
[1:28:43] but the people were not ready so the
[1:28:47] actual if you read if you read the
[1:28:49] uh i mean the the the actual biblical
[1:28:52] timing there
[1:28:53] and also with what brother branham said
[1:28:55] before moses
[1:28:56] you know he killed the man he went at
[1:28:58] the back side of the desert you know he
[1:29:00] spent
[1:29:00] 40 years there before he could come back
[1:29:03] they have
[1:29:03] overlapped that time
[1:29:07] so it was almost about 430 years
[1:29:11] before he came and brought them out
[1:29:15] praise the lord are we together
[1:29:18] amen now i'm saying these things
[1:29:21] like i said i'm not i'm not i'm not uh
[1:29:25] uh uh trying to vindicate brother
[1:29:28] branham i may call
[1:29:29] god already benedict he's seven he did
[1:29:31] his work he's gone
[1:29:34] amen praise the lord but i'm trying to
[1:29:37] grab your attention and there is there's
[1:29:39] a reason why i'm doing this
[1:29:41] because there is there is something that
[1:29:43] that was beautiful here that i saw
[1:29:46] and i might not finish today and if the
[1:29:48] lord bless it maybe we continue on
[1:29:50] sunday
[1:29:50] he says i believe the laodicea church
[1:29:52] age 1906 he says i predict now remember
[1:29:56] predict especially you listening at the
[1:29:58] tip
[1:29:58] i don't say it would be i predict that
[1:30:02] it will end by 1970
[1:30:06] and the church will go completely into
[1:30:09] apostasy
[1:30:10] and she will be
[1:30:14] australia out of the mouth of god
[1:30:16] revelation where god said i was speedy
[1:30:18] out of my mouth
[1:30:19] he says he says it will fulfill in that
[1:30:22] time in the sense he says
[1:30:23] and the second coming or the rapture of
[1:30:27] christ
[1:30:27] might come any time now
[1:30:32] he says i could miss that a year
[1:30:35] i can miss it 20 years i can miss
[1:30:38] it 100 years i don't know where
[1:30:43] but i just predict that
[1:30:46] i call in to a vision he's shown me
[1:30:52] and taking the time the way
[1:30:55] it is progressing the way things are
[1:30:57] progressing
[1:30:59] after mesoline and masculinity died
[1:31:02] hitler came to a disgraceful end
[1:31:04] and all of those things happening
[1:31:08] praise the lord paul says we that are
[1:31:11] alive
[1:31:13] and remain he never said there he was
[1:31:16] he did not print to us he pointed to
[1:31:20] himself
[1:31:21] and those that were in his generation
[1:31:25] are we together praise the lord
[1:31:28] that is the thing with god dealing
[1:31:32] with with hima intent of god
[1:31:35] dealing with him
[1:31:38] sometimes god comes down and and and
[1:31:42] he deals with us he affects our life
[1:31:45] his presence becomes so real just like i
[1:31:49] said
[1:31:49] until you think satan you are done i
[1:31:52] will never
[1:31:52] i will never you can never get me again
[1:31:57] praise the lord then after two weeks
[1:32:01] he said lord was that experience really
[1:32:03] real
[1:32:07] what is happening oh my goodness
[1:32:10] what is happening
[1:32:14] i mean god was so real i heard his voice
[1:32:18] praise the lord amen
[1:32:21] elijah on my camera saying the god that
[1:32:24] answered about fire
[1:32:25] let him be god god came down go under
[1:32:28] his word
[1:32:31] the fire of god strike from heaven with
[1:32:34] all the water that was poured on the
[1:32:35] altar
[1:32:36] the fire of god consumed the sacrifice
[1:32:40] praise the lord
[1:32:44] and then it was just a couple of months
[1:32:46] down the road god was asking elijah what
[1:32:48] do a dare year
[1:32:49] what's happening elijah praise the lord
[1:32:54] amen that is the reason why
[1:32:58] faith is a very important substance
[1:33:02] a very important substance
[1:33:06] you know that god gives to the believer
[1:33:08] when he quicken that thing in your heart
[1:33:11] praise the lord amen
[1:33:14] are we together so he says i could miss
[1:33:17] it a hundred years
[1:33:18] i don't know but the way i see things
[1:33:21] progressing
[1:33:24] i predict
[1:33:30] are we together
[1:33:36] uh um
[1:33:46] seven to week i dropped down to the
[1:33:48] second one sister faith
[1:33:49] i think so i haven't seen them here he
[1:33:52] says the way
[1:33:53] the way progress is going i predict that
[1:33:56] there at the time i don't know why i'm
[1:33:59] saying it
[1:34:00] but i predict that
[1:34:03] that uh that all happened
[1:34:06] between right now 1933
[1:34:09] and 1977 and
[1:34:13] and not ignoring it
[1:34:19] okay he says and not knowing it god
[1:34:21] knows my heart i never know
[1:34:23] until yesterday that uh 1977 is the
[1:34:27] jubilee
[1:34:28] now i i look at this he says
[1:34:31] that's exactly the same amount of time
[1:34:34] that runs out
[1:34:36] that he gave with israel and everything
[1:34:39] at the end now so i'm still
[1:34:40] looking at this quote because i'm trying
[1:34:43] to find the period of the jubilee that
[1:34:44] brother branham was talking
[1:34:46] about so i'm still looking at that and i
[1:34:49] i will share with you uh i will i will
[1:34:52] get back to that
[1:34:53] because he's he's he's he's bringing
[1:34:56] that into
[1:34:57] into leviticus there's a place where he
[1:34:58] mentioned it talking about
[1:35:00] the scene a lot of time
[1:35:04] now so uh uh i mean they're they are
[1:35:08] just
[1:35:08] they are just uh uh
[1:35:12] okay let's uh let's let's take another
[1:35:15] one here
[1:35:17] uh
[1:35:21] that would be the low edition church age
[1:35:22] this one will cut this one comes
[1:35:24] right out of the church-ish book okay we
[1:35:27] we're
[1:35:27] we are over nine o'clock so i'm going to
[1:35:29] stop
[1:35:31] but this is where i i think the whole
[1:35:34] thing gets
[1:35:34] interesting okay
[1:35:38] brother branham as he was seeing those
[1:35:40] visions fulfilling
[1:35:45] he was at the faith fulfillment
[1:35:50] are we together amen
[1:35:55] and there was there was
[1:35:59] two left
[1:36:03] the the sixth fulfillment
[1:36:06] was the great woman that he saw
[1:36:11] amen now so
[1:36:14] it he fed inspire
[1:36:18] after the election when when
[1:36:21] when kennedy was elected
[1:36:25] praise the lord now so you take this
[1:36:29] and also take when brother branham
[1:36:31] talked about
[1:36:33] a great woman stand up in the united
[1:36:36] states
[1:36:37] he says a great woman and in many of
[1:36:41] those
[1:36:41] courts he make a lot of emphasis to the
[1:36:44] catholic church
[1:36:47] praise the lord but all of these years
[1:36:53] the catholic church has been rising in
[1:36:55] in united states
[1:36:57] but people been looking for a woman to
[1:36:59] become a president
[1:37:03] they are looking for a physical woman to
[1:37:06] become a president
[1:37:08] and they have not been watching the rise
[1:37:11] of the catholic church
[1:37:15] are we together now so see the bridge
[1:37:19] here now see the bridge
[1:37:20] that's the thing that caught my
[1:37:21] attention see the bridge
[1:37:23] because of
[1:37:27] the the the women vote it was just at
[1:37:30] that time woman was given the right to
[1:37:31] vote
[1:37:32] and because of their vote it brought in
[1:37:35] the first
[1:37:36] catholic president it inspired brother
[1:37:39] branham
[1:37:40] that this thing is setting the stage for
[1:37:44] the great woman to rise
[1:37:47] and if it is running like this
[1:37:52] are we together are you seeing the
[1:37:54] picture
[1:37:55] amen but that was just the beginning of
[1:37:59] the rise of the woman
[1:38:02] she was just getting up in a spiritual
[1:38:05] form
[1:38:08] are we together but even with all of
[1:38:11] that that was happening
[1:38:13] because he constantly said a great woman
[1:38:17] she could be a president even a vice
[1:38:19] president she kept saying it
[1:38:21] so the eye that's the way we humans are
[1:38:28] that's why our five senses connect us to
[1:38:31] physical things
[1:38:34] praise the lord by his tribe you are
[1:38:37] healed
[1:38:38] when do we wait to say we are healed
[1:38:41] it's when we feed it
[1:38:42] it's when we see it but with god
[1:38:46] he have already said it and when he said
[1:38:49] it
[1:38:49] it is just as it is gone
[1:38:57] so the preacher comes and he read the
[1:38:59] promises of god
[1:39:01] it's in isaiah 53 it's a finnish work
[1:39:04] and what is what is doing is that it's
[1:39:07] raising your faith
[1:39:10] amen to me that finished work
[1:39:15] with god brother brown said if jesus was
[1:39:18] here today
[1:39:18] if you come to him he will says i've
[1:39:20] already done it
[1:39:23] amen all you need is for your faith to
[1:39:25] rise and accept what he has already done
[1:39:31] amen are we together amen
[1:39:36] are you comfortable to go home tonight
[1:39:39] are you feeling like i didn't confuse
[1:39:41] you

[1:41:13] take our hands tonight lord

[1:43:01] said it's not
[1:43:02] comparing quotes with cults it's not
[1:43:05] comparing scripture with scripture
