[1:39] I did this, me, I, mine, my my
[1:42] denomination, me, this, establish
[1:44] themselves.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; What are we preaching about? Ourselves
[1:47] or the kingdom of God?
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Establish the word of God. Take out the
[1:54] unbelief
[1:55] &gt;&gt; and establish the kingdom of God in a
[1:56] man's heart. And a kingdom of God cannot
[1:59] be established in a man's heart unless
[2:01] God made that man thus.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; He cannot be established in a And
[2:06] remember the deceitful part that man
[2:09] think that it's right.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; There is a way that seemth right unto a
[2:15] man. Every intellectual being seems
[2:18] right. As I told you a few Sundays ago
[2:21] when I stood by my dying baby and Satan
[2:23] standing there and said, "There's your
[2:25] daddy died in your arms the other night.
[2:26] There's your wife laying down there in a
[2:28] in a morg. And here's your baby going.
[2:30] And you asked him to answer you and you
[2:32] pulled your he pulled a shade down over
[2:34] you now. And yet he's a good God. And
[2:37] yet you said he was a healer. And you
[2:39] who are standing for what you said was
[2:41] right. You're wrong.
[2:43] Oh, every reason, every mental faculty
[2:46] had to agree that it was right. And he
[2:49] was right that much. So was he right
[2:52] when he told Eve? Your eyes will be open
[2:55] and you'll know right from wrong and
[2:57] you'll be as gods that way knowing right
[2:59] from wrong because God didn't let them
[3:01] see themselves yet that they were naked.
[3:03] So they know they would know right from
[3:05] wrong and he was right. But you see it
[3:07] was contrary
[3:09] &gt;&gt; to the word of God. And so does
[3:12] ministers in seminaries learning
[3:15] man-made theology. It may seem right. It
[3:19] may be a good understanding of the
[3:20] thing, but it's wrong. We don't have to
[3:23] understand it. We believe it because God
[3:26] said it so, and that settles it for
[3:29] &gt;&gt; the whole thing. Will you believe it?
[3:31] Oh, how Eve lusted to have a PhD. How
[3:37] she lusted to be smarter than what she
[3:40] was. Notice
[3:42] how much alike man and his wife. I know
[3:48] it's a man and wife, both naked, and the
[3:51] Garden of Eden, God's Eden. Now, I'm
[3:53] going to close. I said I going to hold
[3:54] just a few minutes. Look, watch now.
[3:56] It's closing. Compare this. Now, how
[4:01] much alike that man and his wife, both
[4:06] in God's Eden, without one stitch of
[4:09] clothes on them, and knew it not.
[4:13] For why didn't they know it? For they
[4:15] were veiled to their senses of nakedness
[4:19] by the holy veil of the Holy Spirit.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; They could look right at each other and
[4:25] they didn't know that they were naked.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; They were veiled with the Holy Spirit of
[4:30] holiness.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; They were veiled.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; God's veil yet today can look and not
[4:40] lust.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; They turn their head. It's a holy veil.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Holy veil. God had their eyes. They were
[4:51] both one was man and the other was
[4:53] woman. And they did not know they were
[4:55] naked because the holiness of God kept
[5:00] their eyes veiled. Notice God hid their
[5:05] conscience
[5:06] &gt;&gt; from from sin by the holy veil.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We had some time lay on that a few
[5:13] minutes. Look here. For he the
[5:16] worshipper once purged. Hebrews the
[5:18] worshipper once purged has no more
[5:22] conscience of sin.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; Sin has passed from him.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Neville say this morning
[5:30] someone I've been asking him, "Why
[5:32] didn't I preach on the Holy Ghost? Why
[5:34] didn't I do this? Here it is."
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is an action in you. It's
[5:38] a life.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Not an emotion. Amen.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Not some sort of a fleshly evidence, but
[5:45] it is a person, Jesus Christ, the word
[5:48] of God established in your heart to
[5:50] quicken every word of this age.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Watch the Holy Ghost in action. Not so
[5:57] much in demonstrations, but in action.
[6:00] What it does according to the word.
[6:02] Notice now the Holy Spirit of God's holy
[6:07] word had a man and woman naked and
[6:11] didn't know it.
[6:13] How beautiful
[6:15] life of the word, the seed. The word God
[6:19] said there is a tree in the midst of the
[6:22] garden. The woman
[6:24] and in the midst of the garden is this
[6:26] tree. Don't even touch it. For the day
[6:30] you eat thereof, that day you die. They
[6:32] were wholly veiled from it. Didn't know
[6:35] nothing about it. Darede to touch it.
[6:38] They were wholly veiled. They were safe
[6:41] in God's provision.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; They were alive.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; They had no death around them.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; They had perfect love one for the other.
[6:52] Perfect life forever. They had perfect
[6:55] love, perfect understanding of the love
[6:57] of God. They had God's word and kept it.
[6:59] And they were alive and safe in God's
[7:02] Eden
[7:03] &gt;&gt; with no death at all around. Then Satan
[7:07] got Eve to listen to his gospel of
[7:10] theology, the gospel of knowledge,
[7:13] higher schooling, higher ethics, better
[7:15] civilization, higher education, and so
[7:18] forth. Then when he got the her to stop
[7:21] and listen to him a minute to his
[7:24] reasonings, which we are commanded to
[7:25] cast down, when he got her to listen to
[7:28] it, now look here, the church is so and
[7:30] so, it's been established for so long.
[7:32] We're one of the oldest churches in the
[7:33] country. the mayor of the city go, "No,
[7:35] I don't care what it is." See, if it's
[7:38] against God's word, be against it.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; That's your enemy. Anything that's
[7:43] against the word is your enemy.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; Everything that's far the word is your
[7:48] brother, is a part of you. Notice, she
[7:52] pulled off the holy veil to see what sex
[7:57] really was.
[7:59] Compare that. What lust really would do.
[8:02] She pulled the veil from off her eye.
[8:06] The holy thing that God had put over her
[8:09] eyes. She wanted knowledge to know what
[8:12] it was all about. So she pulled the veil
[8:14] off to see what it was all about. She
[8:17] listened to the devil. And notice what a
[8:21] place it put her in.
[8:24] They have done the same in each age
[8:26] thereafter. always taking the
[8:29] intellectual side and has now built a
[8:34] kingdom of Satan knowledge his seed that
[8:38] he sowed and has took the world to be an
[8:42] Eden of death.
[8:45] Now notice now look at Revelation 3. The
[8:49] lady is seeing church age. You think it
[8:51] in your mind. In other words, she Eve is
[8:55] Satan's queen.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; See, Satan the serpent got to Eve before
[9:02] Adam got to her.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; So he begiled her.
[9:11] See, so Satan the serpent was the
[9:13] husband of Eve before Adam ever knew
[9:16] him. He begiled her. The Bible said he
[9:20] did. And she knows she was naked then.
[9:22] Now look at the the lady seeing church
[9:24] age. She Eve is sitting as Satan's
[9:28] queen. She's rich in worldly goods,
[9:31] blind, naked again, and don't know it.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; Just like it was in God's Eden. But now,
[9:40] not because the holy veil is over her
[9:43] face, but the lust veil
[9:47] &gt;&gt; that she took off God's holy veil and
[9:50] put on a veil of knowledge for lust and
[9:53] now she has a lust veil that she is
[9:56] blind to it being sin. She's naked on
[10:00] the street and don't know it.
[10:03] She's a prostitute on the street. Women
[10:06] with these shorts on and God's sight is
[10:08] a prostitute and don't know it.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Notice, take our women. Now, if you want
[10:15] to see what condition the church is in,
[10:16] watch the way women are acting. She
[10:18] always represents the church. In Satan's
[10:21] Eden of sin and unbelief, a religious
[10:24] perversion, perverted kingdom. Instead
[10:28] of taking God's word, they've took the
[10:30] intellectual learning of man. Instead of
[10:32] taking the church, they took the
[10:34] organization
[10:35] and they're bringing it to one great
[10:37] head. Now notice, perverted from
[10:39] innocence. Don't miss this. Now, the
[10:43] church has been with this lust veil on.
[10:48] Notice what it's done to her. It's it's
[10:51] perverted her from innocence to
[10:54] knowledge.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; The holy veil, she was innocent. with
[10:59] the lust veiled. She's knowledge. She
[11:02] knows it's pleasant. She knows what it
[11:04] does. See the fruit a tree to be
[11:07] desired. Make him one wise. See, she is
[11:11] perverted from innocent to knowledge,
[11:14] from holiness to filth.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; And lust, and from life to death.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; This kingdom has to die. This kingdom
[11:27] shall die.
[11:28] The God of heaven will destroy it from
[11:30] the face of the earth.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Notice in this perversion,
[11:36] it's become from a man to a woman and
[11:40] from a woman to a man and don't know it.
[11:46] A very good product of Satan's Eden. If
[11:48] you'll watch the streets today at our
[11:50] modern people, notice it was Eve that
[11:53] Satan used to make Adam sin by her power
[11:57] of lust. Now, the same doing the same
[12:01] thing today. Notice bobbed hair, painted
[12:05] facing, sexily dressed.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; See, she does that and don't know that
[12:11] every one of those things is contrary to
[12:15] the word of God. Amen.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; To cut her hair makes her a dishonorable
[12:19] woman, a prostitute.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; To wear shorts touch her disgracefully,
[12:24] put sexy dresses on her makes her a
[12:26] prostitute.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; And she don't know it.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Not because of the holiness of God,
[12:32] because of lust of Satan.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; She caused her, she causes her Adam to
[12:40] lust for her.
[12:42] She took off the clothes that God
[12:44] dressed her in back in Eden for her
[12:46] journey through the this wilderness. She
[12:49] took them off. She stripped herself down
[12:52] when God had her wrapped all over in
[12:54] skins. She's be to shave a little off
[12:56] each time. Now she's back to where she
[12:59] was at the beginning.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Now she's got her Adam to wearing her
[13:03] underneath clothes.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; A man put on them little old
[13:07] looking shorts. Amen. You get out your I
[13:09] don't think there's much man to him.
[13:11] Amen.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; He is the biggest I know of.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; See, she's got her perverted Adam to act
[13:17] like she see
[13:19] &gt;&gt; wearing her underneath clothes. She's
[13:21] seen what she could do out in her when
[13:22] she took off all of her clothes, but her
[13:24] underneath ones.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; That's the shorts, of course, that's a
[13:26] woman's underneath clothes.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; And here her, Adam is wearing them now.
[13:32] which according to God's original word
[13:35] is an abomination
[13:37] &gt;&gt; for a woman to put on a garment pertains
[13:39] to a man and a man to put on a garment
[13:41] pertains to a woman
[13:43] &gt;&gt; from the original word. Think of it now.
[13:47] He now wears her bangs also. He combs
[13:52] them down, puts a curler in them. Some
[13:54] of the most sickly sights I've ever seen
[13:56] in my life is some of those kids out
[13:58] here today with their bangs combed down
[14:00] like this and colored bleached hair with
[14:02] some kind of a proxide something and
[14:03] bleach and rolling in curlers making
[14:05] bangs. You big
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; That's a horrible thing to say from the
[14:10] pull pit, but judgment begins at the
[14:11] house of God.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; You don't even know where you're a man
[14:14] or woman.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; And I understand that our United States
[14:17] Army is coming out next in shorts.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:22] See what the perversion is?
[14:25] &gt;&gt; It's a woman's clothes.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Wears her bangs. The other day I was
[14:29] over Howard Johnson's. Not this one
[14:30] here, but one on the road going out. And
[14:33] I just sat back in the mason. Here come
[14:34] a little boy along his mouth open. And
[14:36] he had dark hair here and it combed it
[14:38] over this way and put a roller in it and
[14:40] curled it up around top of his eyes.
[14:42] Looking out top of his eyes going
[14:43] around. If I ever seen a perversion,
[14:47] see, he wouldn't believe it. He could
[14:48] prove maybe he was male, but in his
[14:50] spirit he's female.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; He don't know what side of the house he
[14:55] belongs on.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; That's all right.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; How perverted. That's what Satan does.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; He perverts the nations. He perverts the
[15:02] church. He perverts the people.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; He is a deceiver, a perverter of the
[15:07] original truth. God made a man a man.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; He made a woman a woman and he dressed
[15:12] them different. And he meant for them to
[15:13] stay that way and to act that way. One
[15:16] is finished, the other is masculine. He
[15:18] separated Adam in the Garden of Eden and
[15:20] did this. Separated Eve from him. Now
[15:24] wears her bangs. She cuts her hair like
[15:27] his.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; And he tries to wear his like hers.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; She wears his outside clothes and he
[15:35] wears her inside clothes.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Now that sounds sacrilegious, but I
[15:41] don't mean it that way.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; It's an absolute gospel truth.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't know it, then there's
[15:47] something wrong with you.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; You're either blind or never been on the
[15:51] streets.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; And she thinks and he thinks that it's
[15:55] right. They're getting along somewhere.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; Women says, "Well, it's so hot.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; The old Apache Indians out there make
[16:01] you shame yourself. More heat they get,
[16:02] the more clothes they put on. Keep the
[16:05] sun off of them. Oh, make it sweat so
[16:08] they can have an air conditioner as they
[16:09] walk. They stand around in the sun. You
[16:12] couldn't stand nothing. You blister and
[16:13] burn." But you see it's what we call
[16:16] higher education. Modern science has
[16:19] produced this. Oh my. There she is naked
[16:24] in Lady Oia and don't know it. She was
[16:27] naked in Eden. You see the two kingdoms
[16:29] alike. One is of sin and death. The
[16:31] other is life and righteousness.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; And there she was veiled with a holy
[16:35] veil. They were both naked. They didn't
[16:38] know it. They didn't know nothing about
[16:40] because they veiled with God's spirit.
[16:42] And here are their veil with lust and
[16:44] they look at one another to see Adam
[16:46] could look at Eve and didn't know she
[16:47] was naked. But now with this lust veil,
[16:50] she doesn't realize she's naked, but she
[16:51] does it under this lust veil to make man
[16:54] look at her.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; It's the only thing she can do it for.
[16:57] You don't believe it, but you do it
[16:58] anyhow. And man, look. And he found out
[17:01] you got so much attraction that he come
[17:02] around put some of your clothes on
[17:04] himself.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a perversion. What a age. What
[17:09] a time. We're how deceitful it is. Oh,
[17:12] all these things and don't know it. A
[17:14] perfect perverted spirit is in the man.
[17:17] He's veiled from the lust of Satan and
[17:20] the woman is too. It's a satonic spirit
[17:23] of a great society. See, they don't
[17:26] know, but they're organization.
[17:29] Women with shorts on belongs to an
[17:30] organization. Men dressed like that is
[17:33] on an organization.
[17:35] I'll give you the abbreviation of it.
[17:37] BSS, Big Sister Society. So that's what
[17:40] they belong to. Come out there a big
[17:42] sister of society without a little big
[17:45] old naughty looking dirty looking thing.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; I I man you may differ me at this but
[17:51] that's the truth.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; You have been perverted and don't know
[17:54] it.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; You're not don't act like a man no more.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; See coming so soft and they would be
[18:01] nothing to them anymore.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; Men and women too. They are a society.
[18:05] There's an organization. Why? John next
[18:08] door wore short. So why can't I? Luella
[18:10] wanted me to wear them because uh John
[18:13] wore them next door. And well, if if
[18:16] Susie Jane can wear them, so can Martha
[18:18] Jane wear them or Susie Lou, whoever who
[18:20] her name is. See, see, it's a society.
[18:23] It's an organization. You spiritually
[18:25] belong to it and don't know it.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; And if that's so, and we see it so, so
[18:30] are you blinded.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; You're blinded to these denominations
[18:35] that Satan has twisted you into. And
[18:37] it's a perversion of God's original word
[18:39] and his kingdom and his plan for his
[18:41] children.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Satan has twisted man and women into
[18:46] these things. And they don't know it. A
[18:48] perverted. No longer a son of God. Bangs
[18:52] hanging down his face and pair of shorts
[18:54] on trucking down the street. A son of
[18:56] God. Deacon in a church. A pastor in a
[18:58] pullpit. Now that ain't a son of God.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; He'd never come through God's stinking
[19:03] filter.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't have them women's clothes
[19:05] on. Amen.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; You sure wouldn't neither would she have
[19:08] the man's clothes on.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; See, it's not a son of God. It's a son
[19:11] of Satan
[19:12] &gt;&gt; and a daughter of Satan. Hard thing to
[19:14] say. Satan has succeeded in perverting
[19:18] and taking over this world and making it
[19:21] his kingdom that man was put on by free
[19:24] moral agency to choose for themselves
[19:27] what kind of life they desired.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; That shows what's in your heart.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Hey, your voice. You know what? Your
[19:34] action speaks so loud it drowns your
[19:36] voice.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Let me go to a man say, "Oh, we're all
[19:40] Christians. We belong in church and
[19:41] script teases hanging all over his
[19:43] office." Here's what he told me. I know
[19:45] better.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; So would you. Let a woman say she's a
[19:48] Christian with short hair.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; You know better than that.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Let her say she's a Christian
[19:53] wearing paint and makeup and shorts and
[19:55] say she's a Christian. You know better
[19:56] than that. The word of God teaches you
[19:58] better than that.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; The word says she can't do it and be a
[20:00] Christian.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; She's even dishonorable and everything.
[20:03] How's God going to put a dishonorable
[20:04] thing in his kingdom? No sir. Not at
[20:06] all. No sir. Their selves shows their
[20:09] desire. You can't get a dove to eat with
[20:12] a buzzard.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; Not at all. A dove don't have any gall.
[20:16] He can't eat that old Karen. If you took
[20:18] a bite of it, it would kill him and he
[20:19] knows it. But a buzzard can eat most
[20:22] anything he wants to. He's got plenty of
[20:24] gall. So then you find out that's the
[20:26] way it is with the world today. Same
[20:28] thing. They're naked, blind, and don't
[20:31] know it. Satan did it by the woman's
[20:34] lust for knowledge, for sex, which she
[20:38] chose by her own choosing. Now notice,
[20:42] it was Eve that led Adam to the wrong.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; And it was a woman that took off her
[20:48] clothes before her Adam took off his.
[20:52] See, it's the woman always, it's always
[20:54] been, it still is the same way. It's the
[20:56] church that leads the man astray. It's
[20:59] the church.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; See, that leads to man that want to be a
[21:02] son of God. It's the woman, the church,
[21:04] not the Bible, God. For the Bible is
[21:07] man.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. The word was made flesh and he
[21:10] was a man.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible is man. The church is woman.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; See, it isn't the church. The Bible that
[21:15] leads the man astray. It's the church
[21:17] that leads him astray.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; It's the church he went naked with, not
[21:21] the Bible. See, no. Indeed, the Bible
[21:23] tells him he's naked. Yes, sir. Now
[21:26] notice how by sex, desire of sex, she
[21:30] lusted for knowledge to know what was
[21:31] this and how whether this fruit was good
[21:33] or not. And she did it. God will take it
[21:35] back someday. Oh,
[21:39] &gt;&gt; by a man.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; It was surrendered by a woman, but it
[21:43] was redeemed by a man.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; The man Jesus Christ, which is the word.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; And then what is it? Notice in closing
[21:52] here, not long ago, I made this
[21:54] statement. I got about four or five more
[21:55] pages in there, but I of scriptures and
[21:57] things I want to refer to. But listen,
[21:59] let's close in saying this. Remember
[22:01] here not long ago I was teaching you on
[22:03] the seven trumpets, the feast of
[22:06] trumpets and so forth.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; And I said there is an eighth day
[22:11] festival.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; So the seventh day would be the last.
[22:14] That'd be the millennium. But there is
[22:16] an eighth day festival
[22:19] &gt;&gt; which if it was the eth and it's only
[22:20] seven days wouldn't make it the first
[22:23] day again. Amen.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Come right back to first day. Then after
[22:26] the millennium is over, then there will
[22:30] be an established Eden again.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; God's great kingdom will be taken back
[22:35] because Jesus fought it out with Satan
[22:38] in the Garden of Gethsemane and won back
[22:42] the Eden which is gone to prepare in
[22:45] heaven to return again. Up in heaven, he
[22:48] said, "Let not your hearts be troubled."
[22:49] But when he was shorter, he said, "You,
[22:51] you Jews, you believe in God. Now I know
[22:54] I got a bad name." He says, "They say of
[22:56] this other, but you believe in God. And
[22:57] as you believe in God, we
