[49:14] chapter 1.
[49:23] Praise the Lord.
[49:33] And um
[49:45] many of those uh uh or all of those uh
[49:47] young sisters that came out on u uh
[49:51] Sunday to watch their friend being
[49:54] baptized. They all came from a kiddo
[49:57] &gt;&gt; and a bunch of them had to work. So, uh,
[50:03] my long preaching was not favorable to
[50:05] them. Amen. But I think, uh, they
[50:08] enjoyed the service. Praise the Lord.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians chapter 1, let's
[50:12] read from verse one. Paul and uh Savinus
[50:17] and Timothy unto the church of
[50:20] Thessalonian which is
[50:23] in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus
[50:26] Christ. Svenius is Silas. Paul and Silas
[50:29] that was in praising. Silas is just a
[50:32] nickname
[50:36] which is in God the Father and in the
[50:38] Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be unto you and
[50:41] peace from God our Father and the Lord
[50:44] Jesus Christ. We give thanks to God
[50:47] always for you all making mention of you
[50:51] in our prayers. The Lord bless you. You
[50:54] may have your seat while we continue to
[50:56] read.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; I love this when Paul says this. You
[51:00] find there he say the same thing in
[51:01] Romans chapter 1 verse 8 in Ephesians
[51:04] chapter 1 verse 16. making mention of
[51:08] you in our prayers. Praise the Lord.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; We thank God always for you all. Amen.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's a there's a
[51:19] phrase that I picked from brother Ben
[51:21] and I love he's always says let's give
[51:23] thanks. I love that. Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; He says uh the scripture says in all
[51:28] things we must give thanks. So he loved
[51:30] that phrase. Let's give thanks and make
[51:32] it part of my vocabulary.
[51:35] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; We thank uh uh we give thanks to God
[51:40] always
[51:42] always for you all making mention of you
[51:46] in our prayers remembering
[51:50] without ceasing your works of faith,
[51:54] your labor of love and patience of hope
[51:57] in our Lord Jesus Christ and in the
[52:01] sight of God and our father.
[52:04] Knowing brethren,
[52:06] beloved, your elections of God,
[52:11] for our gospel came not unto you in
[52:14] words only on it, but also in the power
[52:17] and in the Holy Ghost, and in much
[52:20] assurance, as ye know what manner of man
[52:24] we were among you for your sake. Praise
[52:28] the Lord.
[52:30] And ye became followers of us and of the
[52:34] Lord, having received the word in much
[52:37] affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost,
[52:41] so that ye were examples to all the
[52:45] believers in Macedonia and Asia.
[52:49] For from you sounded out the word of the
[52:53] Lord, not only in Macedonia, in Asia,
[52:56] but also in every place. Your faith to
[53:00] God world is spread about. Amen.
[53:04] So that we need not to speak anything.
[53:08] Praise the Lord. Now uh uh let's just
[53:13] finish our our chapter here. That will
[53:14] be a good thing. For they himself showed
[53:22] Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Show of us what manner of uh entering
[53:31] in we have unto you and how ye turn to
[53:35] God from idols and serving the living
[53:39] and the true God. Praise the Lord.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm out of script tonight. my my
[53:46] scripture reading actually should have
[53:47] come from second Thessalonians chapter
[53:49] one. So I'm completely out of straight.
[53:51] Amen. But uh you will see that uh Paul
[53:55] also in second Thessalonian he have uh
[53:59] uh Silas and Timothy with him as he
[54:02] write onto this church. uh by by a
[54:05] matter of fact is that uh uh the the the
[54:11] second Timothy letter.
[54:15] The second Timothy letter. If I can just
[54:18] if I can just go back and look at my uh
[54:21] my uh my notes here is that uh Paul
[54:25] wrote the second Timothy letter few
[54:28] months after he had sent that letter to
[54:30] first the the letter uh the first
[54:33] Timothy letter and like we said on
[54:35] Wednesday night the second Timothy
[54:37] letter came because there was uh you
[54:40] know uh some people that were inciting
[54:43] in the church that uh you know uh uh uh
[54:48] you know Paul have instructed them or
[54:50] they were calling the persecution that
[54:52] have come on the believers the
[54:54] tribulation. So the brothers started
[54:57] becoming a little bit troubled you know
[54:59] that if this is the tribulation because
[55:02] you will see in first Thessalonians
[55:03] chapter 4 that's where Paul talks about
[55:05] the rapture.
[55:07] Amen. He talks about the rapture in in 1
[55:10] Thessalonians chapter 4. So if they are
[55:13] calling this persecution the tribulation
[55:16] then these believers are they are a
[55:20] little bit confused they a little bit
[55:22] concerned because as you will as you
[55:25] will see in uh uh uh as you will see in
[55:29] in second Thessalonian chapter
[55:34] in 2 Thessalonians chapter one
[55:38] Uh
[55:45] I thought I will I will pick this and u
[55:50] and share this with you.
[55:58] Praise the Lord.
[56:06] Okay, it's actually in chapter 2 verse 5
[56:09] Paul will says here that remember ye not
[56:13] that when I was yet with you I told you
[56:18] these things. So Paul has taught them.
[56:22] Paul has taught them and uh and and and
[56:25] let's let's look at it like this. Uh uh
[56:28] that these people were were were new
[56:31] believers but yet they were taught deep
[56:34] things of the scripture.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there is there is really no
[56:40] time uh uh uh you know uh to to uh just
[56:45] be babying people around and and just be
[56:48] enduring with people you know uh uh that
[56:52] does not want to that does not want to
[56:54] change that does not want to submit to
[56:56] the word that does not want to grow in
[56:58] faith. Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; No there is no time for that. These were
[57:02] uh young uh uh when you go back to the
[57:05] book of acts which of course we will go
[57:07] there uh I have a little subject I want
[57:10] to take from there. So uh I will carry
[57:13] you back to the whole history of this
[57:14] Thessalonian church a little bit. But
[57:17] yeah Paul is telling them remember that
[57:20] when I was with you I taught you these
[57:21] things. I taught you the sequence how
[57:24] things will happen. Why are you
[57:25] troubled?
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Why are you troubled? So tonight we back
[57:29] to our little subject on playing God.
[57:33] I did a whole lot of background on
[57:35] Sunday and I couldn't get to it and uh
[57:38] so we want to get there tonight. I have
[57:41] one quote that I want to share with you
[57:43] tonight is from question and answer
[57:44] 1959. Let's get to it and then we get
[57:48] right into our subject. Praise the Lord.
[57:51] Luke chapter 10 verse 18. He said unto
[57:55] them, Jesus speaking, I beheld Satan as
[57:58] lightning falling from heaven. See,
[58:01] Satan was the original arch angel. Uh he
[58:05] once dwared in heaven. He w uh he once
[58:09] was the greatest person in heavens
[58:12] outside of God. He was God right man to
[58:17] fellowship and he got puffed up in his
[58:21] heart.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Luke chapter 10
[58:26] and the background again we read that
[58:28] again uh that was the beginning of the
[58:30] church just the beginning the believers
[58:33] have gone out to put the word into
[58:36] practice what Jesus taught them they
[58:38] came back rejoicing uh devils are healed
[58:42] and and and and Jesus say hey guys stay
[58:44] right there stay right there you know uh
[58:46] because I saw I I saw Satan falling you
[58:49] know uh uh uh through your prayers
[58:52] through your manifest estation through I
[58:55] saw him falling like a lightning but I
[58:57] would tell you it is not in those things
[58:59] that we rejoice we rejoice because our
[59:02] name is written in the book amen
[59:05] &gt;&gt; and and later on that's where you will
[59:07] see that one of the places where the
[59:09] Bible record Jesus praying the Bible
[59:12] says he lift his eyes and he said father
[59:14] I thank you
[59:16] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[59:18] &gt;&gt; amen that's one of the place where you
[59:20] see Jesus praying the bible says he lift
[59:23] for his eyes up unto the Lord and you
[59:25] say, "Father, I thank you that you have
[59:27] hidden these things from the wise and
[59:29] the prudent,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; but you have revealed it unto the
[59:32] babies.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; You have revealed it unto these young
[59:36] ones." Amen.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; They are young in the faith, but yet
[59:40] they are now rejoicing in uh in in in
[59:43] heavenly authority.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[59:50] &gt;&gt; So, yeah. uh uh uh uh he was God right
[59:53] hand man to fellowship and he be and and
[59:57] he got puff up in his heart and isn't
[1:00:00] that just the way the people get today
[1:00:04] let God just bless a fellow
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; and put a little confidence in him and
[1:00:11] he get to be a know it all
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; he get to be
[1:00:18] he's got to start an organization
[1:00:21] or he got to do something that's
[1:00:24] different. Praise the Lord. Amen. God
[1:00:28] just gave him a little little confidence
[1:00:31] and then he ready to start a worldwide
[1:00:33] ministry. Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Then he starts to he want to do
[1:00:36] something different now. But uh uh as we
[1:00:39] as we as we continue to go here, why are
[1:00:43] thou falling from heaven? Now you see
[1:00:46] he's he's he's he's connecting Isaiah
[1:00:49] prophecy with with Jesus's vision. Jesus
[1:00:54] say, "I saw Satan falling." Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Isaiah has already prophesied on a
[1:01:01] vision looking back to the beginning
[1:01:04] that why are thou falling from heaven?
[1:01:08] Oh Lucifer, like I've said that over and
[1:01:11] over year is that it's a dimension and
[1:01:14] that dimension is a falling dimension.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; You just keep falling. That's why the
[1:01:20] Bible call it the bottomless pit. There
[1:01:23] is no rest. You keep falling. You fall
[1:01:25] from one thing to another thing. You
[1:01:27] keep falling. You keep descending. You
[1:01:30] keep uh uh degrading and uh and on and
[1:01:33] on. Are we together?
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, how about that fallen old
[1:01:38] Lucifer?
[1:01:40] God has had a hard time trying to get
[1:01:44] somebody that he can deal with that we
[1:01:48] stay humble and meek and stay in the
[1:01:53] place until God call him to do
[1:01:55] something.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; You believe there? See,
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; a man that God can bless and he will
[1:02:04] still keep himself a man,
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; not be an angel or a God.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; He won't be angel or he will not be
[1:02:14] playing God.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; He will not be playing God. That's one
[1:02:20] thing you can't play and survive.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; You can't play God.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; You can play a manager. You can play uh
[1:02:29] uh you know in in the business world it
[1:02:31] says uh uh you know you got you got to
[1:02:34] think it. You got to dress it. So you
[1:02:35] dress like a million even though you
[1:02:37] don't have a dime.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You dress like a millionaire. You
[1:02:43] know you are always in suit. You know
[1:02:45] you you know you keep keep speaking
[1:02:47] money. you know, uh you make big
[1:02:49] promises and you know, uh uh uh uh you
[1:02:51] know, I'm I'm going to be you people a
[1:02:54] three-story church and uh you know, you
[1:02:56] just just keep speaking it, but you can
[1:02:58] play God.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; You can play God.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; And and and the reason why I want to go
[1:03:07] down this line, I could preach this in
[1:03:09] an in a in an evangelistical way. I'm
[1:03:12] trying not to. I want to bring it to you
[1:03:15] uh uh uh as a church because the Bible
[1:03:19] says this in the book of uh proverb
[1:03:22] chapter 4. Let's look at proverb chapter
[1:03:24] 4. Proverb chapter 4.
[1:03:28] Let's look at that quickly. We'll come
[1:03:29] back to our quote. That's the only quote
[1:03:31] I have to read to you tonight. And uh I
[1:03:34] purposely did it like that so I will
[1:03:36] have uh uh a few time to just catch up
[1:03:40] on something because I'm setting the
[1:03:41] stage for something. Amen. Proverb
[1:03:43] chapter 4 is uh is uh a favorite verse
[1:03:47] here to many of us. Verse 23, the Bible
[1:03:50] says uh keep the heart with all
[1:03:53] diligence
[1:03:55] for out of it are the issues
[1:03:59] of life. Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; If there is one thing that we must guide
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; is our heart.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because your heart
[1:04:09] was built for a throne.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; And whether you like it or not,
[1:04:15] something will sit on your heart.
[1:04:17] Something will rule your life. Something
[1:04:20] will rule from your throne.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; You have a throne.
[1:04:25] And whether you like it or not,
[1:04:27] something will sit. When a throne is
[1:04:29] made is made to be sat. Brother Brandham
[1:04:32] said, "A throne means a domain, a place
[1:04:35] of power.
[1:04:37] He that overcome will sit with me in my
[1:04:40] throne, even as I've overcome and sit
[1:04:42] down with the father in his throne is a
[1:04:45] place of domain, a place of power."
[1:04:50] And Solomon is saying here, "Guard your
[1:04:52] heart.
[1:04:54] Guard your heart." Because when when
[1:04:57] when when people sit on the throne, it's
[1:05:00] not so easy to get them off.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; When spirit sits on your heart, it's not
[1:05:06] so easy to get it out.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; So, uh uh guide your heart for out of
[1:05:17] faith because I mean I mean it it can be
[1:05:20] it can be so easy. It can be a religious
[1:05:23] spirit. It can be an arrogant spirit.
[1:05:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; It can be a a deceiving spirit.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; So, uh, like he said, and we and and we
[1:05:38] want to take that, God has a hard time
[1:05:41] trying to get a man that he can deal
[1:05:43] with, that will stay humble, meek, and
[1:05:47] stay in the place until God God called
[1:05:51] him to do something. Do you believe that
[1:05:54] a man that God can bless and he will
[1:05:58] still keep himself a man not be an angel
[1:06:02] or a god?
[1:06:05] As soon as man get blessed and has a
[1:06:09] little something given to him, he want
[1:06:11] to become a god.
[1:06:16] He want to be a god.
[1:06:19] And you have to know that that that was
[1:06:22] that was the offer that was given to our
[1:06:24] mother Eve. You will be like God. And
[1:06:27] Satan robbed her from her deity.
[1:06:31] She was a daughter of God. Came right
[1:06:33] from the hands of God.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; When he made man in his image, he made
[1:06:40] man male and female.
[1:06:43] She was an express image of God. But yet
[1:06:46] the devil talked her out of that place.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Instead of being God, he wanted her to
[1:06:54] play God.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Instead of being God, he want us to play
[1:07:01] God.
[1:07:04] Are we together?
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; So that's that's where we going with
[1:07:10] this thought to h uh tonight or uh as
[1:07:13] long as we'll be on it. As soon as a man
[1:07:16] get blessed and has a little something
[1:07:18] given to him, he want to become a god,
[1:07:22] he want to become an angel, he want to
[1:07:25] become a great person, me my
[1:07:30] all that. That's the wrong attitude.
[1:07:34] God hunting for somebody who he can
[1:07:38] bless and pour out the blessing. And the
[1:07:43] more he's blessed, the little the man
[1:07:45] will become. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be like that?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; I pray that the Lord make me like that.
[1:07:56] Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; The more that he bless us, the little
[1:07:59] we'll become.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; The more he bless us, the more service
[1:08:03] we will give.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; But as soon as people start being
[1:08:08] blessed, then they want people to give
[1:08:10] them service.
[1:08:12] They feel now that you know they must
[1:08:14] they are the one now that must be that
[1:08:16] must be treated. You know I was talking
[1:08:18] with my friend there uh in uh uh uh uh
[1:08:21] uh South Africa and we were just talking
[1:08:24] there and I told him I says I I I don't
[1:08:26] understand these things you know uh uh
[1:08:28] uh look at kale
[1:08:31] at at at 80 years old. He says uh my
[1:08:34] strength is just as the same
[1:08:38] as that day when uh when when when Moses
[1:08:41] called Joshua and myself. He said my
[1:08:43] strength is still the same.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; The more he was he was in age, the more
[1:08:51] he was strong to fight the same fight.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; But the more we grow, you find people,
[1:08:59] you know, I was I was talking to him. My
[1:09:00] sister, you you find that you know uh
[1:09:02] the word oldtimer is not a bad word but
[1:09:06] when when people make oldtimer to be a
[1:09:09] word to take h to retire on god then
[1:09:13] that's a bad word.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; You being an old-timer does not send you
[1:09:18] into retirement.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. We've been around this message.
[1:09:24] You know we are old-timers. You know, we
[1:09:26] have put our sheer in and you you you
[1:09:29] you are backsliding.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; The more old you go, you be just like
[1:09:35] Caleb. I I I let your strength be
[1:09:37] renewed
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; to be able to put into God's service
[1:09:41] just like the first day you got saved.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:50] But you find that you uh uh you know
[1:09:52] people we we do that we think that okay
[1:09:55] yeah you know uh uh we being around here
[1:09:58] now all of these newcomers is their time
[1:10:00] to self and what what you're doing there
[1:10:02] is that uh you you you you are breaking
[1:10:05] down that that strong protection because
[1:10:08] when God raised up people h just let me
[1:10:12] let me just come home with this people
[1:10:14] that have known the history of this
[1:10:16] church people that have known you know
[1:10:18] the things that we have gone through
[1:10:19] here and not people that are supposed to
[1:10:21] lay back are people that supposed to be
[1:10:23] standing and fighting every day.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Because just like I said, as long as
[1:10:34] Jesus starting, if you don't bless us
[1:10:36] with a new church, we will still right
[1:10:37] here.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; We're doing the best that we can in
[1:10:42] every We were still right here. I mean,
[1:10:43] there's not a lot of pressure on us to
[1:10:45] get out of here, you know. We were still
[1:10:47] right here. Your children are growing.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] In in few years if Jesus start there
[1:10:55] will be a change of generation. All of
[1:10:57] these little ones uh you know that we
[1:10:59] dedicate right from this pull pit will
[1:11:01] now be going to college and we'll be
[1:11:03] talking about their wedding and and and
[1:11:05] and it's it's a complete h you know but
[1:11:08] uh uh uh uh uh God want people that can
[1:11:12] be able to hold the values. as uh as as
[1:11:15] a young generation come up, they will
[1:11:17] see their parents standing with the
[1:11:19] word. They will see their people in
[1:11:21] church, you know, worshiping the Lord,
[1:11:23] singing special. That's the thing that
[1:11:25] uh you know that that that sustain the
[1:11:27] future generation.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; That's the thing that sustain the future
[1:11:36] generation.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:39] Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Being an old-timer there is no it's not
[1:11:44] a word to go retired on God.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; You know the brother was telling me
[1:11:48] there one time you know the brother was
[1:11:50] preaching. He said we we are oldtimes
[1:11:54] you know that brother you know he's
[1:11:55] preaching he's taking too many time and
[1:11:57] this guy is sleeping in church.
[1:12:00] You are old-timers. So now you can sleep
[1:12:02] because you know everything. There's
[1:12:04] nothing there. There's nothing can be
[1:12:05] preached that you have not heard.
[1:12:09] It's just the devil way
[1:12:12] of making you a religious backslider
[1:12:16] creep.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And pretty soon you just start
[1:12:20] criticizing and condemning everything
[1:12:22] that people do
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; because you are an oldtimer.
[1:12:33] Are we together?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; He says, "Let God start to bless him and
[1:12:40] pretty soon he start playing God. He
[1:12:43] want he he he want to be saved uh uh you
[1:12:47] know uh uh uh and then uh uh he become a
[1:12:50] highmaintenance person because uh this
[1:12:52] one is not good and that one is not good
[1:12:55] and I don't like this and I don't like
[1:12:56] that and pretty soon we don't even like
[1:12:59] you.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Because if we can't help you then we
[1:13:05] don't need you.
[1:13:07] And I'm I'm I'm saying that uh as uh you
[1:13:10] know if we can't help you then we don't
[1:13:11] need you because because we are we are
[1:13:14] called here to help one another.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; You will not be a blessing to us if we
[1:13:18] can't help you. You are not a blessing
[1:13:19] to us if you can't help us either.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; So we see here Solomon says God he says
[1:13:34] he says here God guide your heart
[1:13:38] guide your heart guide your heart you
[1:13:40] realize here is that Jesus was the first
[1:13:44] one Jesus was the first one that that
[1:13:48] that that introduced the subject of uh
[1:13:52] uh uh speaking to our body as a temple.
[1:13:56] St. John chapter 2, he said, "Destroy
[1:13:59] this temple and in three days I will
[1:14:03] raise it up." Now, because the Jews have
[1:14:07] never had an idea
[1:14:09] when they talk about temple, it was a
[1:14:11] physical building.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; They look at the temple as a physical
[1:14:16] building.
[1:14:18] So they thought, I mean, how rude can he
[1:14:20] be? In three days this temple was built
[1:14:23] in 40 plus years. You say in three days
[1:14:25] you will raise it up.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; But there the Bible say he speaks of
[1:14:32] himself.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; So he was referring to his body as the
[1:14:39] temple of God.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; He was referring to his body as the
[1:14:47] temple of God. So Paul comes on now. He
[1:14:50] picks that up and say ye are the temple
[1:14:53] of the living God.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Because he see he see that he he he
[1:15:01] got converted. Now he's out of Judaism.
[1:15:04] The skills had dropped from his eyes.
[1:15:06] Now he has a revelation that the God
[1:15:09] that dwell behind the curtains now he's
[1:15:12] dwelling in the heart of man.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:16] When he got the revelation that Jesus
[1:15:19] was God, he got the revelation that
[1:15:22] Jesus was the tabernacle of God, then he
[1:15:25] understood that God is also tabernacling
[1:15:29] himself. Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like how his fullness was in
[1:15:34] Jesus. He he he's he's pouring himself
[1:15:36] out in his people by the baptism of the
[1:15:39] Holy Ghost.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Hallelujah.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; So Jesus says, "Destroy this temple.
[1:15:46] Three days I will build it." Paul picked
[1:15:48] that up as a revelation. He understood
[1:15:50] it
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; that Jesus was just a temple. He was
[1:15:53] just a dwelling place.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Knowing that you yourself,
[1:16:00] you are
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; a temple of God."
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; You are a temple of the living God. The
[1:16:11] reason why you were made, the reason why
[1:16:14] God made you
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; was for expression.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Hebrew chapter 1, the Bible called Jesus
[1:16:22] the express image.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; So when God made man, he made us to
[1:16:29] express himself through us.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Because h
[1:16:36] if if he he had the attribute of a
[1:16:39] healer. Let me not say if because that
[1:16:41] that would not be the good English to
[1:16:43] speak. Amen. He has the attribute of a
[1:16:45] healer and then uh there is no way that
[1:16:48] he can manifest that healing until he
[1:16:51] express it through our sickness.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So when I get sick and
[1:16:58] he express his healing virtue through
[1:17:00] me, then his attribute of a healer is
[1:17:03] known.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; So the only reason why we are made is
[1:17:06] not to to show up ourself and rule one
[1:17:09] another. We are all made as an
[1:17:12] expression.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; God want to express himself through us
[1:17:16] from the day that we were born to the
[1:17:18] day we go to the grave or the rapture.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Bible says we are
[1:17:24] made for his pleasure. What is that
[1:17:27] pleasure? Expression.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; We are made for expression. And how can
[1:17:34] God express himself through us unless
[1:17:37] he's sitting on the throne of our heart?
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; When God is sitting on the throne of
[1:17:47] your heart, you are not playing God.
[1:17:49] Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; You become God. Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Because
[1:17:54] it's deity in you.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; You are not playing God.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; But if God is not sitting on the throne
[1:18:00] of your heart,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, you will go in and out
[1:18:04] of playing God. You play God to
[1:18:06] yourself. Praise the Lord.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Sometime you are the God of mercy.
[1:18:13] Sometime you are the God of judgment.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:22] You love the Lord tonight.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; So we see here that uh uh this this
[1:18:28] church like I said on Sunday was the
[1:18:31] first first church that that really got
[1:18:34] that they got a weight. We we we know
[1:18:36] that at the beginning Paul and Silas
[1:18:38] they were whipped but you see they were
[1:18:40] not whipped by the Roman they were
[1:18:43] whipped by the Sanhedrin's council. So
[1:18:46] it was the church, the Sanhedrin's
[1:18:48] council that were trying to stop uh
[1:18:50] Peter and John for speaking in his name.
[1:18:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; But what what these people experienced
[1:18:59] here uh uh Paul and Silas and and all of
[1:19:02] these men that was in prison this this
[1:19:04] time it was under the Roman government.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Christianity was spraying out. The
[1:19:10] lion's anointing was moving and and and
[1:19:13] converting the hearts of men.
[1:19:18] and the empire become threatening
[1:19:23] because people were speaking more of the
[1:19:26] name of Jesus. History even tell there
[1:19:30] was a plague that came in Rome
[1:19:33] and when the plague came in Rome it was
[1:19:36] only where the Christians are.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and the people they
[1:19:43] started they started spreading gossip
[1:19:46] and what they said is that the
[1:19:48] Christians you know they they they you
[1:19:51] know the Bible says that the Pharisees
[1:19:54] sold that story to them it says that you
[1:19:56] know they they they took Jesus body from
[1:19:58] the grave and that's why they are eating
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; that's why they are not getting sick
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; because every every time the year said
[1:20:08] this is my body you know we are blessing
[1:20:11] that my blood, you know. So they said,
[1:20:13] you know, that that that was how they
[1:20:14] were spoiling the minds.
[1:20:17] They were spoiling the minds of the
[1:20:20] people against the Christians.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; But more but more people were sneaking
[1:20:25] in and glory to the Christians to be
[1:20:27] prayful.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; That was one of the thing that that that
[1:20:34] uh that that that make the the Roman
[1:20:36] Empire uh uh furious against the
[1:20:38] Christian church.
[1:20:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Because it looks like that's a name that
[1:20:47] is now moving among the people.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; They're no longer talking about the
[1:20:51] Empire Caesar. I keep hearing Jesus,
[1:20:54] Jesus, Jesus.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; And pretty soon the church came on under
[1:21:05] the spotlight of hell.
[1:21:09] Amen.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Honor the spotlight of hell. And then
[1:21:12] can can you imagine all of these people
[1:21:14] stay young in their faith?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; That that that fresh zeal. You just
[1:21:24] think about the the the time you got
[1:21:26] converted.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; The time you got converted and and and
[1:21:31] and and
[1:21:33] God became real to you. That fresh zeal
[1:21:37] is the zeal where you are ready to die
[1:21:39] for Jesus.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; You read you read the gospel and you
[1:21:47] hear what he went through and the price
[1:21:49] that he paid and the suffering that he
[1:21:52] had. You you says, "I'm I'm I'm ready.
[1:21:54] I'm ready now."
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; But the thing that was troubling the
[1:22:04] church was not it was not the
[1:22:07] persecution itself but the way that it
[1:22:10] was interpreted. Now if we have missed
[1:22:13] the rapture why why then should we be
[1:22:16] persecuted.
[1:22:18] That's that's the way the believers were
[1:22:19] thinking. If we have missed the rapture,
[1:22:22] then it's just better let's just go back
[1:22:24] to the word.
[1:22:27] Because if this is the tribulation and
[1:22:29] we have missed the rapture according to
[1:22:31] what Paul has taught us,
[1:22:35] it's either we seal our life with our
[1:22:38] testimony.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Or let's just go back to the word
[1:22:44] because we have lost our reward. So that
[1:22:46] that was the thing that was troubling
[1:22:48] these people here.
[1:22:49] So Paul now has to come back and and
[1:22:52] then and re-echo quickly write them. He
[1:22:55] he quickly wrote this this letter uh uh
[1:22:58] uh called second Timothy. We see only
[1:23:01] have three chapters there and and then
[1:23:02] if you if you if you read the three
[1:23:05] chapter you see how how he he uh he he
[1:23:08] enforced certain things
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; to the brethren. Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; He he make them to understand.
[1:23:15] Chapter two. Now I beseech you,
[1:23:18] brethren, by the coming of the Lord
[1:23:20] Jesus. That's 2 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[1:23:22] That's what we read from on Sunday. And
[1:23:25] by our gathering together unto him, that
[1:23:27] ye be not soon shaken in your mind or be
[1:23:30] troubled, neither in your spirit nor by
[1:23:32] words or a letter as from us. Praise the
[1:23:36] Lord.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine somebody going around
[1:23:41] and say they get a letter from Paul?
[1:23:46] Oh, he gave me in a private letter
[1:23:49] when I was having lunch with him. He
[1:23:51] wrote this thing privately. I kept it in
[1:23:53] my Bible.
[1:23:55] The same thing men has done.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; And they have built doctrine around this
[1:23:59] message.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; I was hunting with brother Brandon. He
[1:24:03] told me this. I was hunting I mean uh
[1:24:06] what is so special that he can tell you
[1:24:07] that he cannot say from the back of the
[1:24:09] pit.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] So now he's he's telling these people
[1:24:21] not not even letter from us. Don't don't
[1:24:23] don't don't don't even accept it that
[1:24:25] anybody say they get some kind of a
[1:24:27] special letter that they've been keeping
[1:24:28] in their Bible.
[1:24:30] Let no man deceive you
[1:24:33] by any means for that day for that day
[1:24:37] shall not come.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; For that day shall not come. Which day?
[1:24:44] the day of the Lord.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; The day of the Lord. Uh I hope I'll be
[1:24:50] able to find find a a place here and and
[1:24:53] go into that a little bit and and just
[1:24:56] and just and just tell you because even
[1:24:58] when it comes to the church age book
[1:25:00] when brother Brandham talks on the day
[1:25:02] of the Lord and the Lord's day uh uh
[1:25:04] many people get it confused and they
[1:25:06] think it's two different time. No, it's
[1:25:09] the same.
[1:25:11] When Paul says, "I was in the spirit in
[1:25:14] the Lord's day," it is just the same as
[1:25:17] the date of the Lord.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Which of course you go right through all
[1:25:21] the Bible, the date of the Lord is the
[1:25:23] day of judgment.
[1:25:25] Are we together?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; But we'll find time and go into that.
[1:25:30] Love the Lord tonight.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so he says uh nobody
[1:25:37] must bother you about that day for that
[1:25:39] day shall not come except that there
[1:25:41] come a falling away first
[1:25:45] there come a falling away
[1:25:48] and the man of sin be revealed the son
[1:25:52] of pedition.
[1:25:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; The man of sin be revealed the son of
[1:26:02] pedition.
[1:26:07] Now, so we see we see all of that.
[1:26:12] We see all of that. Uh uh
[1:26:17] uh.
[1:26:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] Jesus was called
[1:26:34] the son of life, the prince of life.
[1:26:38] Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And here the scripture is now referring
[1:26:44] to a man that will be called the son of
[1:26:47] pedition.
[1:26:49] Hallelujah.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. A son of waste, son of uh uh
[1:26:57] damnation.
[1:26:59] All of that goes. Then the Bible says
[1:27:01] here that son of pedition
[1:27:04] who upholdeth and exalted himself above
[1:27:07] all that is called God
[1:27:09] or that is worshiped so that he as God
[1:27:13] seated in the temple of God. Now so this
[1:27:17] is a prophecy like like I said on on
[1:27:19] Sunday uh the powers are gathering.
[1:27:23] Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; The powers are gathering. the the the
[1:27:26] anointing that is leading the church is
[1:27:29] gathering to take the church in the
[1:27:31] rapture and all the evil powers that is
[1:27:33] waring against the church is also
[1:27:35] gathering and it will come to a climax.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; For the believer, it will come to a
[1:27:43] climax word that all that power will be
[1:27:47] gathered in a group of people.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Called the bride.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; He will have there there will be a
[1:27:58] messenger. That's the reason why St.
[1:28:00] Luke 17:30 identified a ministry that is
[1:28:04] called the son of man. Jesus said in the
[1:28:06] day where the son of man is being
[1:28:09] revealed.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; What is the son of man? Is the gathering
[1:28:15] of that power that anointing in in one
[1:28:18] ministry.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:25] And then it's is it's is also going to
[1:28:27] endure in a people. And then we see here
[1:28:30] also on this side uh there is there is
[1:28:33] also a gathering you know of power that
[1:28:36] that is going to get into one man uh uh
[1:28:40] uh uh uh called the antichrist and is
[1:28:43] also going to possess a group of people
[1:28:47] that will be on the road in the
[1:28:49] leadership of that man. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:52] But here is where I want to go. Here is
[1:28:54] where I want to labor if I just would
[1:28:56] take a few minutes here and and work
[1:28:58] with you. Now, seeing here, see see what
[1:29:01] Paul says. He uh uh uh uh uh he
[1:29:06] opposite, he exalted above all that is
[1:29:09] called God,
[1:29:11] all that is worship. So that he as God
[1:29:15] sitted in the temple showing himself
[1:29:18] that he is God. He said, "Remember ye
[1:29:22] not that when I was with you, I told you
[1:29:24] these things.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; And now ye know what
[1:29:29] that he might be revealed." Praise the
[1:29:32] Lord.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; For that fullness to come, there is
[1:29:36] something that is stopping it.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; But this is where the catch is for our
[1:29:43] our our our subject. For the mystery of
[1:29:47] iniquity does already work.
[1:29:51] It's already working. It has not come to
[1:29:54] a fullness in a man yet, but it's among
[1:29:57] us.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; And if it's ammon,
[1:30:03] sorry.
[1:30:05] If it's ammon, what does it want to do?
[1:30:10] Go back. It want to oppose and exalt
[1:30:12] himself. Amen.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; A spirit that is among us want to oppose
[1:30:17] and exalt himself above all that is
[1:30:20] called God. That spirit want to be
[1:30:23] worshiped.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; It want to be worshiped.
[1:30:31] And uh he want to sit in the temple. He
[1:30:36] want to sit in your temple.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Your body that's supposed to be a temple
[1:30:41] of the living God. That spirit want to
[1:30:43] sit in your temple
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; and make you worship him.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:53] And make you worship him. You know,
[1:30:56] brother Brian was asked if Jesus is God,
[1:30:58] then who was he praying to? He says it
[1:31:01] was Jesus subjecting
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; this body to deity.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; To the deity that was in him.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; He was submitting his human will
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; to the deity that was in him. And that
[1:31:19] is the Christian life. And that is where
[1:31:22] the greater battle is.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Is is is is you subjecting yourself,
[1:31:27] humbling yourself.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Not feeling like you know better than
[1:31:32] somebody or you more spiritual than
[1:31:34] somebody.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; No, it's you constantly bringing
[1:31:40] yourself subject. Not my will, Lord, but
[1:31:44] your will be done. Amen.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Not my desire, but what
[1:31:49] you desire to work in me.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; That's what the Christian life is.
[1:31:54] That's where the greater battle is.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; If you're not ready to fight that, I get
[1:32:01] a good I get a a good news. It might be
[1:32:03] a bad one, too. Amen.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. is that you already have a God on
[1:32:08] your throne
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; that you are worshiping.
[1:32:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; It was Habacu that says the Lord is in
[1:32:18] his holy temple. Let the earth keep
[1:32:20] silence.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; The Lord the word when it gets there
[1:32:27] every every element of your body keeps
[1:32:31] silence.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; If the word is ruling your life,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; whether it's a thought, whether it's a
[1:32:43] feeling, if it is not of God, it keep
[1:32:46] silent.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; It don't have a voice in your body.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; If it's a sickness, it don't have a
[1:32:52] voice in your body because the Lord is
[1:32:54] in his holy temple.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Let this earth
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; keep silent.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Let this earth come to obedience. Yes.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; It's when you have the the the Lord uh
[1:33:05] uh on the throne of your heart. It's
[1:33:07] when you have the word on the throne of
[1:33:08] your heart.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; But until we do that,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; there will always be something that will
[1:33:19] be exalting itself in our lives.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; The devil would never come as the devil
[1:33:26] to exalt himself. He tried that.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; He tried that. In Isaiah, the Bible says
[1:33:31] he tried. He says, "I will exalt
[1:33:33] myself." And right away, he was cast
[1:33:35] down.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; So, he never come again and and and and
[1:33:39] say, "I will exalt myself." But you know
[1:33:40] how he comes?
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; He comes and says, "I'm your pastor.
[1:33:44] Without me, you can't go to heaven."
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; So, he takes a man and and and and he
[1:33:50] exalts that man in your life. You become
[1:33:53] so fearful of that man more than being
[1:33:55] fearful of God.
[1:33:59] That's right.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes is run even run their
[1:34:11] home.
[1:34:13] I'm your father. I born you.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; No, you must understand that you are
[1:34:18] just a steward.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; God sent a son of God through you. He
[1:34:22] sent a daughter of God through you. They
[1:34:24] are not your property.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. When we do that,
[1:34:27] we are playing God
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; in the lives of our children.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; That must not be a language
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; to use. I'm your father. I born you.
[1:34:36] They don't know that.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Then we are we we are exalting ourself.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; They already carrying your name. They
[1:34:53] should know better. You didn't buy them
[1:34:54] from from Walmart.
[1:34:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; So you see, you see this place of
[1:35:03] playing God.
[1:35:05] You see this place of playing God is
[1:35:07] something that is so is so is so evil.
[1:35:11] Evil so simple
[1:35:15] and and and and then we we can we can go
[1:35:18] in that place so easily.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:26] Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; So, so yeah, Paul is saying here that
[1:35:30] the that that mystery of iniquity does
[1:35:34] already work.
[1:35:37] Already work. Knowing what is what is
[1:35:40] good and and and and failing to do it.
[1:35:44] Praise the Lord. Knowing what what is
[1:35:46] right. We know that we must not exalt
[1:35:49] ourself over one another.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; That's why the word of God said we must
[1:35:53] encourage one another. Amen.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; But because it's a spirit that is
[1:35:56] already working, the devil will not come
[1:35:59] and says, "I want to exalt myself." No.
[1:36:01] He will either use somebody. He will
[1:36:04] either come through a religious spirit
[1:36:06] or he will come through something that
[1:36:08] would take the dominance over your
[1:36:10] heart. Something that you will tremble
[1:36:12] at

[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Don't let the job play God in your life.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Nothing must play God because you
[1:36:48] already have a living God. He's real.
[1:36:50] his truth to you.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing where I'm going with
[1:36:56] this?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Because you must guide your heart.
[1:37:00] That's what issue life.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Anything that conquer your heart
[1:37:05] conquers your entire body. Your heart is
[1:37:08] your throne.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; When the throne is conquered, the entire
[1:37:12] h
[1:37:14] city is subject.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:19] Amen.
[1:37:21] That's why you see the uh uh in a time
[1:37:23] of wars uh uh uh the rebelling force
[1:37:26] they don't they don't go to the
[1:37:27] marketplace where they are targeting
[1:37:29] they are targeting the throne they want
[1:37:32] to get to where the leader is where the
[1:37:33] president is
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; the moment they get there even if it is
[1:37:36] there for one minute they can tell you
[1:37:38] says I'm your president
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; you say in the marketplace they will not
[1:37:45] believe it you know the devil can blast
[1:37:48] your mind and and you you know trouble
[1:37:50] your mind, speak lies to your mind,
[1:37:52] speak fears to your mind,
[1:37:54] you can you can you can fight through
[1:37:56] that that will not conquer you. But when
[1:37:59] he take when that thought resides on
[1:38:02] your heart,
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; when fear now resides on your heart,
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; That fear that is dwelling on your heart
[1:38:12] start creating voices.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; You start hearing voices of fear is
[1:38:17] coming right from your heart. It's not
[1:38:19] coming from the kitchen. It's not coming
[1:38:20] from the ceiling. Don't look for it.
[1:38:22] It's not there. It's coming right from
[1:38:24] your heart because a spirit of fear has
[1:38:26] captured you.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; That's that's the that's where sometime
[1:38:33] people get on a a a spirit of delusion.
[1:38:36] We'll get to that. Yeah. Paul also
[1:38:38] identify that in the scripture to the
[1:38:39] believer. Strong delusion.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Believing in a lie.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; But that lie is covered with a religious
[1:38:47] spirit.
[1:38:53] Are we together?
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; We're not called to play God.
[1:39:01] We are called to be gods. Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus says them that the word of God
[1:39:07] come to is it not written in your word
[1:39:10] that they are Gods. Praise the Lord. And
[1:39:13] if you have received the word of God for
[1:39:15] this age, you have received the word of
[1:39:17] God for this hour,
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; that word is calling you up,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; to the to to the the the place of power
[1:39:24] and potential so you can take your your
[1:39:26] position as a son of God. Just like an
[1:39:29] Adam, you can speak to little things in
[1:39:30] your life.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; You can speak to little things in your
[1:39:33] mind.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; You can speak to little circumstances
[1:39:36] around you and little by little, your
[1:39:38] faith starts to grow.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:43] Why? Because that word is sitting on
[1:39:45] your heart.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; You are getting command from the throne.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; You are getting command from the throne.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; That's great.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; If not, the devil will keep playing God
[1:40:03] in our lives.
[1:40:06] He will keep playing God. He knew that
[1:40:08] it it would not happen if he says I will
[1:40:11] exalt myself. He know that it will not
[1:40:13] happen. The angels threw him out.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now he says well now so I will go
[1:40:18] among the people.
[1:40:21] I won't use my voice. I will use their
[1:40:23] own voices in their head. I will use
[1:40:26] their own voices and I will rule them. I
[1:40:29] will be God in their life.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; They will take their time to go to
[1:40:35] church. to stay right in the church and
[1:40:36] they worship me the devil.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; They are far away from the living God.
[1:40:40] They are far away from the worship of
[1:40:41] the true God.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Because all that will be ringing in
[1:40:49] their mind, oh, I need to go to church
[1:40:51] before I go to hell.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; He will put that fear on them. I need to
[1:40:56] go to church before I go to hell. No,
[1:40:57] you don't need to come to church to go
[1:40:59] to hell
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; or to stop you from going to hell. We
[1:41:01] come to church to fellowship. We come to
[1:41:04] church to enter in.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Enter in fellowship around the word.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; All the word you've been reading from
[1:41:10] the beginning of the week. All your
[1:41:12] prayers, bring it together. Let's
[1:41:14] fellowship. Let the Holy Spirit be
[1:41:16] speaking from the pit and in your heart.
[1:41:18] You say, "Yeah, I read that in the
[1:41:20] scripture. Oh, glory be to God. Thank
[1:41:22] you, Jesus." That's that's what that's
[1:41:24] what the service is about.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; It's not for you to sit down and then
[1:41:28] one man just be shouting. No.
[1:41:33] is to draw us into fellowship
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; so we can be rejoicing in the promise
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; I always had a question about that but
[1:41:43] the Lord spoke to me today he answered
[1:41:45] my question thank you Jesus
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; then church don't become a d place
[1:41:50] church become an exciting place to go
[1:41:53] because I know God is going to speak to
[1:41:55] me
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; I know he's going to speak to me
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; if I have an answer question on my
[1:42:02] heart, I know exactly where to go.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Because if I if I if I just stay there a
[1:42:07] little while, if I just paid attention,
[1:42:09] if I just enter in, he will call my
[1:42:11] name, he will say something.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; The world will come alive.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; But we have just make this thing. We uh
[1:42:19] the devil, that's why brother Brian
[1:42:21] preached the message s on Eden. The
[1:42:23] message s on Eden. That's that's exactly
[1:42:25] what he preached. The devil has played
[1:42:27] God
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; and the world is worshiping him as God.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; He has played God in our lives.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; When we all realize that we are all
[1:42:50] saved by the grace of God.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's only by his grace that we
[1:42:55] are saved.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; And if we are saved by the grace of God,
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; if that grace was enough to pick you up,
[1:43:02] that same grace can save a sinner.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; It's not because you were better.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; It's because God amazing grace.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; God favor you.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; That's what the That's why the word
[1:43:19] grace means favor.
[1:43:22] Amen.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; So you see that's that's Satan's Eden.
[1:43:30] In Satan's Eden, what he does? He play
[1:43:32] God and the people worship him.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; If he makes this thing go to God in your
[1:43:41] life, he brings you to the place and
[1:43:43] make you to believe that you cannot
[1:43:45] survive without this. Wow.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Without this you cannot survive. If the
[1:43:53] devil will raise anything up in your
[1:43:56] life and make you to believe that
[1:43:57] without that thing you cannot survive,
[1:43:59] you have an idol on your throne.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; If that is the thing that is ruling your
[1:44:05] life, you have an idol. That's that's
[1:44:08] the same thing you would do with people
[1:44:09] on a drugs. Without drugs, they can't
[1:44:11] survive. Without Without alcohol, they
[1:44:13] can survive. With without smoking, they
[1:44:15] can survive. and and and even people
[1:44:18] that are in uh you know sex addicts
[1:44:20] without that they can't survive.
[1:44:23] If he can just raise something in your
[1:44:25] life
[1:44:26] and make you to believe every day you
[1:44:28] must go to that altar and worship that
[1:44:30] thing.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Every day you must get down to that
[1:44:35] altar and worship it. Sometimes he even
[1:44:38] make you yourself your own god. Every
[1:44:40] day you must worship yourself. You're
[1:44:42] just there that I mean I I mean you
[1:44:45] spend more time before the mirror than
[1:44:46] anything.
[1:44:51] Praise the Lord. Well, I mean that we
[1:44:53] must look decent.
[1:44:55] Sisters must look pretty
[1:45:00] but nothing must take the place of God.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Do you see where I'm going tonight?
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; We must guard our heart.
[1:45:11] Guard our heart. When brother Bam says
[1:45:13] look at your motive and objective.
[1:45:14] That's what he means. Guard your heart.
[1:45:17] When you're doing something, carry it
[1:45:18] back to your heart. Why am I doing this
[1:45:20] for?
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Am I lifting Jesus?
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Or it's just all self-gratification.

[1:52:11] because he can bring us to total
[1:52:13] obedience.

[1:55:15] We can't go without conviction.
[1:55:18] [Music]
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you tonight.
[1:55:26] We love you tonight, Jesus.
[1:55:29] Lord, I believe, oh God, Father, you
[1:55:31] have brought us to this place to call
[1:55:34] for consecration in our lives. You have
[1:55:36] brought us to this place so we can take
[1:55:38] an inventory of ourself
[1:55:41] and say, "Who's ruling the truth of our
[1:55:43] hearts?" What is the thing that is
[1:55:45] having preeminence? What is the first
[1:55:47] thing we wake up in the morning that we
[1:55:50] give audience to? What is the last thing
[1:55:52] we commune with before we go to bed?
[1:55:54] What is the alpha and omega in our
[1:55:56] lives?
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:56:01] Father, the hour is too late, Lord
[1:56:03] Jesus.
[1:56:05] Like a prophet said, we must not be
[1:56:07] playing church. We must be manifesting
[1:56:09] the promise of our day. Help us, Lord.
[1:56:12] We dedicate ourselves to you tonight,
[1:56:16] Father. Lord Jesus,
[1:56:21] everyone in service with us tonight, oh
[1:56:23] God, and those that will listen to this
[1:56:25] message after, Father, I pray, bring us
[1:56:27] under conviction, Lord. Bring us under
[1:56:30] conviction, Father. We need to go back
[1:56:31] to that place to rededicate oursel,
[1:56:34] recommmit ourself, Lord. Live a life of
[1:56:37] consecration where we will be earnest,
[1:56:39] Lord. We be true to ourself, oh God.
[1:56:42] will be truth to ourself. Father,
[1:56:48] [Music]
[1:56:49] that is the commission of the
[1:56:51] supernatural.
[1:56:53] He told the prophet, if you will be
[1:56:55] sincere,
[1:56:57] nothing will stand before your prayers.
[1:57:01] So we dedicate
[1:57:04] this temple to you, Jesus.
[1:57:10] Place your fire on the altar, Lord,
[1:57:15] and make my heart new.
