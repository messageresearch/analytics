want to thank the pastor we want to warmly welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may God bless you all without any further delay we're going to open our Bibles we'll go to m Matthew Chapter 5 we will begin in verse five may God bless the pastor one a great man of God very humble and simple me personally I love him and appreciate him amen amen we will pay attention to the word we'll read verse 11 here is speaking of beatitude our message this morning is don't miss the crown don't miss this this crown and our subtitle is the enemy of a man the man is man himself we will actually go through this thought here we will just read a little bit here if you take verse four watch what Jesus is saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven amen amen we will go to verse 11 blessed are ye when men shall devour you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name my sake J insist Jesus is uh insisting Rejoice the Bible does not said don't get angry but rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophet which were before you pay attention that the Christian life is not easy the Christian Life it's a spiritual [Music] athletism if you play the game outside of the Norms you'll be disqualified it's the same thing as in basketball if you play any any any ways different than what the Norms are you are be disqualified and now the the players of basketball they have one purpose and is to to win the price or the crown as spiritual athlet we have also to gain or to obtain that crown and Jesus is giving us different example of those that have been persecuted if you know that they are persecuting you if they say something wrongly about you instead of verifying left and right but just rejoice and that's my message that's my thought you may be seated may God bless you we will go to the book of second Timothy verse 2 verse 5 Paul is saying [Music] here let's read second Timothy it says to Timothy thou therefore endure hardness as a good sold of Jesus Christ endure hard hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ to find Soldier or to recruit soldiers there are conditions and the are it's not easy for those that have uh weak nerves brother Benham says that the army of God are selected God does not just pick or recruit any type of God picked up Daniel because he knew his caliber he took shadra M and ab because he knew who he was who they we are the Royal Seed of Abraham we don't think we actually breaking PE this is our reasoning we report everything that is contrary to the word considering as unexist but the Bible says Abraham regardless of his age regardless of the age of Sarah she already was into menopause she was already old in age [Music] she did not doubt concerning the promise and if we are the Seed of Abraham every seed must bring forth after its own kind suffer you must suffer the Bible says here and if a man also strive for mastering yet he is not crowned except is tribe lawfully the the athlet or the mastering yet is not grounded except is Strive lawfully set seven comp consider what I say and the Lord give thee understanding in all things and what we need today it's not men that are smart we want people that are wise wisdom is more important in intelligence and we will go little by little I will just give you a little uh summary how we must overcome how we will overcome brother bham says this brother bham says I will teach you how to overcome how to fight how to fight I will teach you how to uh uh uh ese escape the the the uh the punches of the enemy before before he reaches to you yes that's right before he reaches to you I speak Spanish I preach in Spanish it's been a long time since I spoke French so if I speak in just forgive me for it I always uh preaching Spanish now I'm standing in front of a church that speaks English amen we'll go little by little here amen amen because Satan has a punch against you now you have to be able to be wise to identify that this is the punes of the enemy coming you cannot by yourself go fight against Satan because you don't have strength to go against him he stopped punching people since Eden he knows the word more than most of the Believers now Satan and God usually discuss about the word but brother says here in the only place of worship preach in 1965 in the morning paragraph two brother says this brown I was sitting over there talking to my old friend brother Brown while the song was going on and he said Bram brother Bram brother Bram I never seen until yesterday what you've been talking about there are many people that come to church they have no idea why are they coming to church and there are many people that come and sing and and give tith and they sing and then go on but they forget that we are Pilgrim and passengers every single one of us has a limited time on Earth there are people that will only live for 30 years and others will leave for 9 years now they will just leave for a day every single one of us have an appointed time but we have all met on Earth so if you were my brother in heaven you will be my brother on Earth if you were not my brother in heaven you will never be my brother in on Earth because God created us in heaven he not created us on Earth creation did not begin on Earth creation began in heaven that's where they were worshiping God that's why God was speaking to job and say where were you when the sons of God were worshiping me so if you were worshiping God in heaven here you will worship him as well if you never worship Him in heaven on Earth you cannot worship him that's why you have to be careful what kind of friendship you getting yourself involed every friendship that put you apart from Jesus Christ it's not the right and every friendship that brings you down it's not friendship you must have a friendship that brings you higher into the word why there are many that are afraid to sing to worship God somebody you see somebody's afraid to show that he's a Christian and many people are afraid or ashame that's why Paul says I'm not ashamed of the gospel because the power of God until yesterday I never understood what you were talking about what you have been talking he already spoken Spen but one specific that was only yesterday he understood what brother bham was talking about brother bham said If people could just get into what you are speaking about he said every obstacle will move out of the way that's exactly right that's right it's exactly right if you could just grasp it if people could be able to penetrate to catch to grasp to enter into the spirit the obstacle will fall off by itself why do we have obstacle it's because we have not Gras or penetrate the spirit of God yet people think that to be a a message believer is to walk with or to have a serious face like this may God bless you brother how are you doing brother beloved you are you are you okay and that's what be a sister does not mean you should have a long to be a brother is not to have a Corporal aspect to be a brother is to obey the word the one who obey the word is the one who the child of God the one who disobey the word of God even if he has a even if he has a good aspect that's not a son of God God did not created us on Earth and read the message that day on calary paragraph 45 and the Earth in which we are walking into not just the Earth even our body here it's the Earth Satan in the morning early early morning came he put a his foot step a step when the Earth was in the form of a Vulcan before the Earth can be the Way You Are he was like a vcan and Satan put his his foot Satan knew that the Earth will be cold he knew that God would form men out of the earth when Satan sin in heaven when all of us even demon included were in heaven nobody was on earth when Moses says that in the beginning of the word the Earth was a void Moses did not see the step of the foot of Satan on Earth that's why he required the Rev reation Mal had to come he said God so that we can understand that God cannot create something that was already deformed when God creates there is perfection when God gives you a pastor give you a perfect Pastor when God gives you something is perfect when God created the Earth was perfect who created the deformation when we were in heaven Satan put his foot on Earth is in yeah his footprint and he put his footprint on Earth and and Satan kick him out God kicking out K when in when he sin in heaven God kicked him out of Heaven Satan came he took his property without title so God in order for God to form us he put us on Earth he put to inside of us the half of the of the remember knowing well that not even one of his elect will be will be lost but in every single age he will pick up his own children Satan he prepared a a a a punch against Jesus he knew that God will need is element to make or to form men so when God form men what is created is the soul of the soul is created but the Earth or the body the flesh is formed people the Bible says oh creation creation is not creation it's formation is to form that's why Jesus says the soul that sinth is the one that will die Jesus did not say the body that sins he says the soul that Sinn who sins is the one that will die if the Earth God took the 16 element of the earth and the men was created in the image of God was the spirit man now the spirit cannot fall because God is reproducing now this body here this flesh here is the animal man man with a a footprint of Satan that's why the new birth is required so now when we go to glory is the body without a footprint of Satan now God takes away the the imprint of Satan that's why that day on calary he came and walk into the imprint of the enemy he came and eras his job inside of you you were not a son of God when you believe you were sons of God before the foundation of world when you step into the Earth you accepted the message of the hour of your time without anybody to explain to you anything that's why you can get mad you can see a Son of God getting mad normal it's normal because it's just the the the footprint the imprint of Satan you you have to be careful what your eyes are telling you now the Bible says that the eyes is the lamp of the body so if your eyes does not see clear your your entire body will be in darkness the eyes is the lamp of the entire body our eyes here are connected to our feelings you look at a person like this then you get mad automatically you look at somebody your feeling changes that's something that is bubbling inside of you it's Satan now I'll show you the mistake that we usually make the soul that sin not the body the the the Samaritan woman she was a prostitute but she was a daughter of God Jesus knew that she she was a daughter of God Jesus know that you here no matter regardless of your Mist you are a son and a daughter of God but when the word is preached you say Amen to the word you receive the word now look in his body five husband and the sixth one was not even her husband what kind of life but she was a daughter of God the imprint of Satan touch her oh push her to do these things but the imprint regardless of the imprint of Satan it does not mean don't judge a person by based on what you are seeing but your eyes will judge wrongly because you you don't know who is the Son of God and who is not a son of God somebody say glory to God be wise that's why there are many people that judge brother bam brother bam that you think Jesus that you said that you believe people did not believe that Jesus was born of a of a virgin they just saw mared with a baby all of these people did not believe now watch the grace that God has given to you now look somebody that is doing fine the Rich Young Ruler he met Jesus the the person the most important person on Earth he told him says there's something that is missing how many things that you are missing here in your own life but to the Rich Young Ruler there's only one thing missing God spoke to him I can't see in your body you are perfect that's very good Now obey go sell everything that you've got give it to the poor and come and follow me he look at Jesus he see Jesus wearing sandals he sees himself well dressed with a lot of money he said me obeying a man with sand his eye missed he missed the mark by by his side the eyes is the lamp of the body so if your eyes is does not look perf your whole body will be in in darkness now the Rich Young R forsake he went to hell if people could penetrate If people could understand and Jesus says this in Matthew Chapter [Applause] 5 blessed are the poor in spirit the the small a yeah there's a difference between the holy spirit it's the spirit so S capital S and this the S is really capitalized but to with man is is minuscule because man is uh Soul spirit and body all men all the men as men spirit it's life that is in us when man dies regardless if he was a pagan or a Christian his Spirit goes back to God the body goes to the grave but now there's a problem with the soul the problem is the now the soul that sinth is the one that will die so if you had believed Jesus if you had obeyed the angel will carry you the day of your death if you were a A nonbeliever or aever you don't have any Crown you will go first to hell that's true blessed are the poor in spirit now the spirit has five senses imagination reasoning be poor in reason reason a Believer does not seek to have reason or to a Christian will forsake his own reason or own reasoning feelings or affection I feel this is not the The Life of Christ stop your feelings you don't know who is the Son of God your feeling will lie to you we have reasoning it's the sense one of the sense of the spirit God want us to be poor in reasoning does he say it does not say bless are the poor in money it says poor in spirit don't reason when the word is pre believe the word of God forsake everything don't have try to reason and continue so forth now we're going forward brother will say something here very important I would read it I will go a little bit verse 44 Matthew Chapter 5 44 okay verse 40 let's go to verse 40 If any man will sue thee at the law now we entering into the Norms of the word in in a church there's Norm in a house there's Norms in a country there are norms in a game there's a norm now based on the Christianity in order for and here's what is required now you would realize that 90 90 99.9 of Christian does not do this and don't miss this Crown my brother if any man will sue the the law and take away that Cod let him have that clo also said brother that's my shoes give me give me I don't like I'm not I'm not playing give it that's for me yeah is it yours oh take it then amen amen now I stop I begin to preach now Now watch how you behave out there and a Christian is not just when we are here now a Christian is practice outside when you practice and that's when people fail to do it I've understood a lot of things I'm a surgeon I I've learned a lot of things when you practice you practically do it you see the responsibility you look say if this woman dies what can I tell this man here now when the man comes into the hospital running he says doctor doctor he thinks that you are God he does not understand he does not understand that this man make mistakes he can make mistakes imagine such a mistake in your own life now now realize if any man and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him TW give to him that ask thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not that away 4 but I said unto you love your enemy bless them that curse you 43 ye have heard that he has been said thou shall love thy neighbor and hate thy enemies and Me Jesus I said unto you love your enemies that's what Christianity is about what you have come to do here this morning love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that's my message Brothers don't miss this Crown because the enemy of a man is man himself right God has Norms you cannot just say we're going to heaven but you cannot forgive you say oh we're going to heaven when you see a brother outside you think like oh wow this one that's according that's what you see how many time have you pray for that brother the mission of the church is to save those that are because the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better of more than the blood of Abel Abel was a bad a really uh uh was not a good person look at the behavior of now it's God who shows the behavior of abble to K it says the blood of your brother speak Vengeance from the earth he wanted Abel wanted also God to kill Abel so God can punish Abel a Christian the one that uh a pagan is Ming he would pray God please kill my neighbor so that he can know that I really have God my brother and sister if you are at that level that you have never understood yet the blood of Jesus you are a daughter of God okay if you are a daughter of God the blood of Jesus Christ speaks of better things than the one of abble what does the blood of Jesus the blood of Jes when Jesus was they actually spit on him he insulted him he practic practice his own word he says father for them of their sin because they know not what they are doing what does the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ speaks on favor of the of the guilty the blood of Jesus is an advocate for the one that is guilty Paul Paul s s criminal was a criminal he killed sons of God like Steven what could Paul say to the mother of St a brother kill your son and you have to forgive that's what Christianity is about he said bless are the poor in spirit bless bless because theyit the kingdom of God oh brother they really kill your your son and you you just let it go like that my brother yes my brother why because in the kingdom of God we are the uh the uh the fo of Christ because the the gospel is the of the world the the worldly things are the foolishness for the gospel that's what the gospel is about the Forgiveness the blood of Jesus Christ speaks of better things brother bam when he was preaching here in the there were two young people that were kissing and the man of God he said stop what you are doing over there the Bible says the Bible say the Bible says they didn't listen they continue to kiss one another he he was a snare of the enemy he was was the Trap of the enemy how can you not identify the Trap of the enemy that's why not even one Among Us can Resurrect The Dead no now brother somebody that died and and resurrected him back to life I don't believe such things I'm a doctor I know what death means don't just come and say somebody fell he says that he's dead are you a doctor to to certify that he's dead that's why all this light going on I will show you something that bam was capable to go beyond to see that the young people that were there they were kissing in service in the mid in service without cursing them now you will see a pastor it says and you have come to give bad examples this is the Church of the Living God me but if it was your own son you would not do that if he was your sister you would not do it now you're doing it is just to show off the people you have to go above you have to be wise you you have to know that God gives us test you will see how we would react to that test because without suffering there is no Crown amen all every Christian has to suffer that's the condition Jesus did not carry all this left a little bit of suffering to the bride so that she can grow with suffering so that she can be molded by by suffering only me because you are daughter of God that's why it's happening to you that's why it's happening Rejoice be grateful and God spoke to brother I I will let you decide decide whatever whatever you will say that's what will happen to them if you say death they will die right on the spot if you say par butam never said death the blood of Jesus Christ speaks of better things he says young people over there I forgive you a Christian without pardoning does not exist amen one day brother comes out of the church you see one of the the girls from the church she was there and but gets closer to her how are you doing I know that you have already bad intention don't even come closer and embrace me and God knows that I don't have this don't get closer to me not even try to get closer to me the Kingdom of Heaven later find that really dressed not she was not well well dressed she was walking and brother bam came he was right behind her said don't follow me don't follow me she took off a a cigarette and she said to brother bam do you want to smoke with me you also want to drink brother say what are you doing now as they were walking can you just imagine theet now did not look I can even get closer to brother B was doying everything to bring people to Christ and that's what we ought to do and tells her what are you acting thus he says he says the last time that you spoke in that service was my last day to to to to know no it was the day that I crossed the line brothers and sisters there's going to be a day it will be the last sermon people are used to come to church because he became like a second nature people are not ready to be transformed people don't pray for the guilty they're ready to hear bad news they don't want to see a brother or sister to prosper the bad news they're ready to talk about it but when is a good news they stay quiet that's it and with that and we think we're going to heaven he again say that I went to fast for a brother or a sister and now he has become a burden in him is it's not what we are doing here if there are people that will be surprised is those that claim to be Christian because the majority will not go to heaven why because they are disqualified because they willingly decide to make that decision why we are not able to do even a little tiny Miracle brother they cannot come bring back life because we are full of really bad feelings may God forgive us take take the Bible with me in Psalm 12 the Bible says here in the book of Psalm 12 verse two etern they speak vanity help Lord For The Godly Man ceaseth help Lord For The Godly men it's R to find a man it's hardly to fight them you can't count one and then the dead are gone people G and the bad ones are remaining is the the is the Cry of David help Lord For The Godly Man seeth for the faithful fail from among the children of man they speak vanity every everyone with his neighbor with flattering lips and with a with flattering lips and with double Hearts do they speak the Lord shall cut off the flattering lips and the speak of proud things who who have said with our tongue we will prevail our lips our house own our own who is Lord over us for the oppression of the poor and for the sighing of the needy now I are raised said the Lord I will set him in safety from him that per at him the words of the Lord are pure words the word is pure but why are you not pure be pure as the word is and the result will be pure as silver tried in the the furnace of Earth purified seven times for thou thou shall keep them oh Lord thou shall preserve them from this generation forever the wicked work on every side when the Violent Men are exalted the pure men are being uh ceasing the Bible also speaks of flattering leaps and double hearted men are flattering watch verse four verse three they speak vanity everyone with his heart with flattering lips and with double heart do they speak verse two a double hearted men or women vers three yes they speak vanity everyone with his neighbor with flattering lips and with double heart do they speak double heart yeah people are double you think it's a brother but everything that you say is kind of recording it and then he says do you think that guy and then [Music] he said that just wait I want just to show you no no no please play it again and that brother said ah Lord no no no no I need to go see that brother I will correct him right away and then I'll will tell him what I'm thinking what I'm a able to to do the Bible does not say that what you have to do when you hear things such say amen glory to God I will pray for my brother amen amen so if we live according to the Norms of the word we'll be victorious every single day watch brother he was able to fix even those little tiny but us here we keep on confessing years after years we are waiting for that brother that we s against to die so that we can be free now just imagine how people are you do not have the Holy Spirit why are you manufacturing brother had love that's why in this sermon calling Jesus on the scene watch what is saying calling Jesus on the scene preached in 1964 in paragraph 15 I remember one night in velia Illinois I walked into the meeting and I had no more been in that meeting over five minutes there wasn't a feeble person around the place anyway wheelchairs pushed out and peeled up blind were seeing the death and dump speaking and speaking just simply the spirit of the Lord was present and today we come into the church without the spirit of the Lord you coming with what kind of spirit what is the spirit that you bring to church after talking bad about somebody after fighting with people now you coming with your offering without fixing that issue first hallelujah hallelujah my brother do you realize that something is brother the prophet a lie he went to pray for a child that was sick but God told him go back he went back he fixed it now he came back when he prayed the demon left the child you know what people have a lot of demons and they don't even know I will tell you something in the message paragraph three he says while I'm preaching here I'll see how Spirit are living for one person go into somebody else and it's very scary what I'm I can see a spirit in like like a with with uh uh uh with like woman living and go into somebody else Spirit he has the form of a crab it's cancer iser ASR we know when somebody has cancer he has the mental of death on him that has the form like a crab that's why he has roots when somebody you you know that he has a a mental of death on him that has the form of Coach yes yeah when somebody has has he has the mental of he has a form of of of a Tor and now Pastor I'll bring somebody has epilepsy just bring him we'll pray for him you might actually get out of here with epilepsies yourself you know why this kind of spirits are kicked out when you have fast f and prayer when somebody listen to the music OFA he has also a mental of death that has the form of a bat explains all of thisy in the message demonology if you love worldly songs hear what the spirit upon AAL is is is hindering you to breathe you are close to death that's why you got to PR so that you can get rid of of of Darkness you are very you don't have patience you are rushing all the time you fighting one another a man that is not able to speak to his wife the enemy of the men is remember man when he's poor when he comes to church he comes to church he pray with energy oh God help me Lord he was once a a a a a stubborn child he was a to to his parents maybe Rebel at school Reb rebel against the pastor the pastor was telling him careful now his life became worse Jesus is wonderful when you came and repent God accepted said God bless me give me a wife give me money give me a good job Heal Me Lord God heals you give you a wife he give you work he give you everything now Men start missing church I'm busy my job does not allow me to be there on Sunday I can't do anything my brother why but now you are blessed God lift you up now in the book ofes God gave men the ability to to dominate to those three things God men had to to have dominion the Heaven and Earth also to have dominion God Jesus had dominion over the spirit in heaven when he went up he took he took captive captivity captive when he was on Earth he resurrected the dead he walked on water us as well we have to have dominion over the demons we must walk upon the world must control the Earth not the Earth that has to control us why are you crying God put you as responsible so that you can be the chief so that you can give orders that you can have dominion God give you the responsibility now you going back to no no you don't stand God gives you a job God gives you a wife you start assaulting the wife you start mistreating her God give you a husband he said all time arguments and stuff but when the sister was coming to church you were there somebody give me her number said brother brother and that's s you cannot present me to the sister present me please we always use an agent sister rebecc that's my friend I don't even know you s brother I don't know you now I just

how to answer with the message the sister realized that this one is a pagan help me I want to marry the enemy of a man is man himself man has suffered to God gives sister Rebecca comes home now the brother will say I the day that I knew you now you sister you do not have the Holy Spirit brother is you who does not have the Holy Ghost it's you who does not have the Holy Ghost now you start insulting the sister it becomes like a door those things has to cease it says men that are insulting their wife and women me I will kick you out of the church I went to a sister one day she she's she's the husband goes and lift up weight and he has musle and the wife is very big and I went to handle the situ so so the sister took the the the V the vacuum and one more way in front of the pastor you see what I I said the sister said I don't believe such a word I said okay said pastor you Cann just wait a little he has to speak I see the man going please forgive me you see now you know how how

church with such Behavior what is the enemy of a man his man himself because he's not wise now there are situation where mens to creating this problem God gives you the responsibility to not to create problem and conflict now men are blessed without Ministries God has blessed them give them Ministries now it's hard to find somebody that is serious it's difficult that's why you got to pray for your pastor to find good it becomes hard to find pray that God keep pray that God because you you a sheep you need the good food that's why I met brothers that said I have the Holy Spirit people that do not even miss one occasion is they say they have the Holy Ghost now I told him said can we carry you to bra Brazil with in Brazil over there and women are walking without close I saw Brothers he said brother now the problem is you never had the occasion to go out now if they expose you to such things you will fall the enemy man himself when you start speaking another woman you don't know that you are married when you watching what you are watching know you are married and things on your teleph they come to they're ready to see but they cannot see what they are doing wrong what kind of Christian is that you creating conflict yourself without wisdom without the Holy Spirit and after I I'm not going to go to church anymore I will listen to The Prophet at home word the word listen to the no brother now watch what this what this court says here brother bam says don't stay home you are listening to a go to [Applause] church says bring your children to Sunday school and don't don't stay home he says even if you going to a church even if they're feeding you only 20% just take the 20% bring it home don't stay home and we'll finish in a little bit here Christ is the Myster of God revealed paragraph 82 83 okay I was called in on something like this the other day a group in Arizona call my attention to that a ministerial group said the only thing that I have against you brother bham is one one of the things the people that come come out here with with you we can't get them to go to church anywhere said they got children and everything they want go to church and said well we

don't sit at home go fishing and hunting and things like that on Sunday staying home on Sunday is a sin go to church if there's a tape that we need to listen this is it and people say the pastor does not leave the world and this here and there I will no longer go to church you will fail you will miss the crown the people who say that you know when I pray even if I don't go to church God listens to

get a little problem here you ask God to give you patience give ask God to give you Tranquility ask God to keep you the enemy of man man himself this man himself obey the word obedience is better than a sacrifice pay attention is more important than anything else nowadays we don't pay attention brother say brother they say something who said it this month I'm going to him right away Peter understood Lord said Lord how can I forgive the in a day in a day how many many times I forgive the one who me bless are the poor in spirit 70 time seven now you still carry the how angry you were yesterday now when you will fall sick say Pastor pray for me God will not heal you yes why because God already told you what to do you are the consequences of what you are now a Christian does not go to bed with angry no no no no no no you see a brother with his wife in the same room the one is looking up the other one is looking at the other side a man a Christian cannot sleep without a family prayer today even family prayer does not even exist how can you how did you give birth to your son here now you the child grows up and start beating you up it's because you you are the one who he says

will be saved when she will teach her children the word Oh Glory finishing here Glory sister the gospel is not what we thinking the gospel is what he thinks of us now I want to finish with the I know it's not easy it's very hard be wise brother bam says when Elisha was working with Elijah before Elijah Ascend he says watch me going pay attention to the word don't try to manufacture the Holy Spirit be the way you are that's why I don't care about anybody I am who I am I don't I'm not afraid of anybody I am free you love me the way I am amen you don't like me the way I am amen that's exactly like that you see a brother that comes to a sister do you want to eat a Fufu he's hungry no no he said no no no no it's it's 11 he knows that he does not even have F at home he does not have anything to he

million under his Dominion he's the one with mistakes he had anger issue two speak you couldn't speak he had a hard time to speak and Moses was speaking for a long time you had patience to just listen to him now if you lose patience you are disqualified believing Moes it was to believe God look at Peter a very terrible man but God made Peter a reference a reference to enter Heaven he says the baptism is the name of Jesus Christ God takes a man with mistakes to lead you the to the way of there's not going to be a man a perfect man you are lying to yourself that you will find a man that is perfect I have mistakes I have a lot of mistakes a lot but I am saved by the grace of God if you don't have mistakes I going to clap I'm going to appla you I will appla you I said thank God and I know

be patient God will will will will prove youest because God goes through the fire to be a genuine gold it has to go through the fire now a Christian must go through trials let no man said when he tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither temp he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own last and enticed what kind of last do you last is the flesh then when last has conceived he bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bring bringeth forth death when a man fails does things he says oh brother that's that's the devil no it's not the
