how's it done in God but on the Sanford tipless short o book and marriages divorced and dad is not even in the memories of God hey you're justified therefore being justified it was accused she was Jude you never done in the first place the old unions in the Sea of God's forgetfulness he wasn't married to begin with he the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you in your place he took your place or you were / destinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world of Iowa said so you are the predestinated see how did you come to do this you are deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parents Eve so far your own by your natural birth you come at your E please committed adultery let's reason you as born an adulteress you're sinner to begin with that's right you is deceived into it you had no don't you donate your bone you never did it but cause that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation the world puts her name in the Lamb's Book of Life like my little ego story all of these heard he had old farmer setter and uh he had one time they said have enough here that age to bore the hen so then he found the eagle egg

unmerited of your own God did it himself didn't do you before the foundation world so I slipped the wedding ban on you put your name on a booth what a Thanksgiving praise our God our toasting I might say this we all know that the modern church Pentecostal it is present condition all the denominations together I'll throw them all in one button because they are you remember he's go to bundle the wheats first and burn them take this he takes all the wheat stalks and burn it all that person they say come against the swing take the home they're all gathering in a bundles bundle of Methodist Baptist Pentecostals all going take a medical counseling that's out there all burners he we all know that the modern church in his present condition and its present state is in no condition to finish up the Great Commission that God gave the church for this day how many Pentecost was a leader it's where one tune is dream is this that other fuss fight once this one's that good and every one of them afraid to face the word they know you tell about this are I'll can't help alot you believe that no care what he does I they see Jules what mammy and Pappy you hear you might be a state prisoner someday you might be just how the other you better be a son of balm [Applause] now we know that the church could not the Pentecostal church by no means by no means to carry out the life's a message in his present condition good why can't even agree on work you words revival hey man how you go to it can't do it so he's seen denominations out try it's going to be elected people that's elected for C 0 and soda every one of us know that the whole rank of denominational Pentecost when all are dead that is to the born-again Christian of the message your first husband's dead you can already did God let it die it's finished all of its scientific intellectual educational scientific ways of its so-called Bible schools and things as parish what's it done separated one darshan Trinity turn June this year's over here and down here that's a mess unconscious pretty causal well went you're a young man hoodies listening writing right now and a young woman cheap on to certain churches she said I says this separation that's it what's the matter said we're a different faith I said all I'm sorry are you Catholic she said no she told me the domination sure she belong to a Pentecostal that's the what are you he's Pentecostal to burn on dirt in our nation oh you know the Roman Catholic Church started all Pentecostal I mean it was that true it taken 2,000 years to get worst got now just don't take nothing in the scripture Noble nothing while the Pentecost on twenty years then I'll be worse than they are now they gave something rolled away it is now washer see what it isn't what is it look at their Papa mama is let the women cut their hair they could you dare anything they'd remove the bones in this chair settle oh no wonder no wonder the damnation of God picked up God put it right before your eyes you shut your eyes and fail to look at it shut up your bowels of compassion when you see the true Word of God in these seven seals been vindicated and proved to be sowing witness in the heavens across the nations and everywhere else for great signs and wonders that he promised he was his then you shut up so I can jump on oh my dad and don't know it thieves and trespasses you said oh we all know that the church in that condition couldn't finish up this last day how could it bring Malachi 4 Ian hey how could it do it they don't even believe in such a thing hey man how could it believe living in Luke 17 30 - bringing all these other scriptures has promised this I think it could do because it denies as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man look at the additions a lot as Sodom was in in that day look condition the church in the day look what happened to ever Abraham they elected look what happened to the locking them down and Sodom look at the Billy Graham and old robbers name down there amongst all denominations look at the elected Abraham Church pulled out look what kind of sign that Jesus himself the incarnated God Stanner in human flesh you said that was an angel the Bible studies of God Lord God Illium better than human flesh showing that you would I saw anointest church in the last days if he God working in human flesh again as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man same kind of a thing this sit right there the scriptures please just search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and there they just testify this so we know they're dead God let it die in its own selfish scientific educational program all the Pentecostals used to talk about about son and kid away to Bible screw back we're all brothers loud members around here running out of the church but all now it's a great thing my son's away in Bible shooting diggities green so good oh you think they could take it today you think I'm trying to support ignorance I'm not I'm telling you there's a difference between this intellectual age that we're living in where the church has been pregnant with science and all these so-called figured out and everything you don't figure out God well then that priest had God figured out so perfectly note how the Messiah was going to come but he comes so different what they had figured out it wasn't scientific how could this may have been an illegitimate child where'd he go to school at Gordy's education come from or to get this dirty well you try to teach us you're born in fornications hey halt for goodness sake see the same thing repeat again they repeat again all in their religious sign religious science according to what their Bible school says that's the way they would that's where it has to be there isn't God just fools and every time it always comes different it didn't know it's time just forces times in Christ time didn't John times in disciples time didn't Wesley's time didn't lose their time didn't pentecostal time and so hazard to you don't change his pattern always comes the same thing only farmers to them seven six ages to the seventh in Revelation ten set this hour a change and then how we're closing the Sandia's finish up the Great Commission how could they do it we know they're dead God let it die in a scientific age all of it so so he could do all open up the seven sealed mystery to the under nomination or bribed how candidate nomination except those seven seals when it's absolutely contrary serpentine and all those other things the whole four seven mysteries is contrary to what they did because they took the old spool from the Bible School and the seven seals of God is open there on the mountain let God lo let me die right now this pulpit at that ain't the truth now for told you years six months for my told me go to Arizona what would happen out there in a desert and this man sitting out here tonight we're standing right there in prison when the seven angels come down and even made the magazine Life magazine back to article evidence right there into Observatory everything now they don't even know what's all about and everything has been said all even to the destruction of California coming up now and all these other things and how it told me how many days would be how it would be were this big earthquake happen Alaska that would be the beginning of the sign of time and what would take place and just word by word what it said it's never fail one time you'll never see it fail and it can't fail because it's God's words inhabited I saw a boy but I can't Hey God had opened up those seven seals knock in the denomination I've always been against it but our denomination he might take a bribe not a denominational brat he couldn't do it it's against his own word you open those seven mysteries in there this shows fourth brings forth those things it's been here since the foundation of the world might be revealed in the last days the sons of God they brought that forth now before the people they sit there now just under denominational price oh there's your two books one of them is a lands book of life your name on there's predestination okay it can't go because you can no more take that away in nothing see because it's for our gain to be on there but the regular book of life you
