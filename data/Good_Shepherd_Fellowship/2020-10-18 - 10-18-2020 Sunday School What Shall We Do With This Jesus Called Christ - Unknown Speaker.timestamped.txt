[3:30] so
[3:35] [Music]
[4:24] brought into judgment because it
[4:27] happened
[4:28] about 80 70 when the great uh roman
[4:31] general titus besieged jerusalem
[4:34] about 80 70 with his army from rome and
[4:38] there they paid the price for rejecting
[4:40] him
[4:41] today as we look upon that trial there
[4:45] and we go out here and impersonate it in
[4:48] different ways of
[4:49] trials on good friday and talk about it
[4:52] and things
[4:53] and the very same thing that we are
[4:55] talking about happening on that good
[4:57] friday
[4:57] is right under our noses today
[5:03] and our elders are doing the same thing
[5:05] they did
[5:07] taking it right in on a similar trial
[5:10] after a similar promised word of this
[5:14] day has been
[5:15] vindicated just the same as it was
[5:17] vindicated there
[5:19] jesus a common carpenter's boy so
[5:22] thought
[5:23] he was the word of god made manifest
[5:26] and he was thoroughly identified because
[5:29] the works of god had
[5:30] manifested himself through him and prove
[5:33] that he
[5:34] was the messiah
[5:38] the day that similar cases come again
[5:41] when the holy spirit has come upon us in
[5:43] the last days and identified himself
[5:48] right in our church and has proven the
[5:51] same works that he did
[5:53] when he was sharing the fullness upon
[5:54] jesus christ he did the same thing upon
[5:57] the bride
[5:59] doing the same thing and still we want
[6:02] to get rid of it
[6:04] remember these are tapes it's made now
[6:06] that goes over the world not only to
[6:07] phoenix here i'm
[6:08] speaking to half of the world at this
[6:10] time because we've got a
[6:12] tape business that goes around the world
[6:14] notice
[6:15] today we have a similar trial after the
[6:18] same
[6:19] identified word
[6:23] hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same
[6:25] yesterday and forever
[6:27] saint john 14 12 he that believeth on me
[6:30] the works that i do
[6:32] shall he do also matthew 28
[6:35] all the world preach the gospel to every
[6:37] creature lol while the world says be no
[6:40] more
[6:40] yet ye shall see me for i will be with
[6:42] you even in you
[6:44] to the end of the age jesus christ the
[6:48] same
[6:48] yesterday and forever they have chosen
[6:50] today
[6:51] not only a murder but a murder of the
[6:54] word
[6:56] a satellite to the very first murder
[6:59] when the apostles was preaching the
[7:01] gospel and come down through irenaeus
[7:04] and many of the great
[7:05] reformers and founders back in the early
[7:07] age they come to nice one time for a
[7:10] showdown
[7:11] and they decided to make a universal
[7:13] church
[7:14] to force people to come under their
[7:16] jewish diction
[7:18] many who's read the history there knows
[7:20] many old prophets come there
[7:21] with animal skin wrapped around them
[7:24] eating only herbs and things
[7:26] and they tried to hold out for that word
[7:28] hold for the word of god but what did
[7:31] they do that 15 days of
[7:33] bloody politics they finally decided
[7:36] to make a universal church and grant
[7:38] some paganism with christianity
[7:41] and set it out as a universal church and
[7:43] today the protestants are throwing
[7:45] themselves together in the ecumenical
[7:47] council
[7:47] doing the same thing grafting tradition
[7:51] of man
[7:52] instead of taking the word of god which
[7:54] is thoroughly identified
[7:56] by the holy ghost that he's the same
[7:57] yesterday today and forever
[8:00] the church stands in the bounds today
[8:03] and
[8:03] found wanting you're back in pilate's
[8:06] judgment hall
[8:07] yes sir what does it do it's making an
[8:10] image unto the beast it's a satellite
[8:13] underwrong
[8:14] when the ecumenical council is forcing
[8:17] in will force every protestant
[8:18] denomination
[8:19] doing it practically always there now
[8:22] full gospel and all the hour's going to
[8:25] come when they'll have to come
[8:27] or stand and at that time when that
[8:30] force come you've
[8:30] already identified yourself with the
[8:33] mark of the beast
[8:35] oh that's exactly what is it a
[8:37] protestant harlots
[8:38] with the old mother roamed the
[8:41] revelation 17
[8:42] said she was a mother of harlots exactly
[8:46] protestant denominations
[8:48] holding out in her hand the cup of the
[8:50] wrath of the of god
[8:52] for her toast her testimony this is what
[8:54] we believe in each one this what we
[8:55] believe
[8:56] here's what the church is to believe the
[8:58] word of god and let every man's word be
[9:00] alive
[9:02] that's what it's supposed to be but we
[9:04] bring christ again to that
[9:06] great crucial hour that he stood in the
[9:09] pilot's judgment hall
[9:11] pathetically a little bunch pushed off
[9:13] to one side
[9:14] with a bowed head other denominations
[9:18] rejected them refused them and turned
[9:20] them away and said have nothing to do
[9:21] with it
[9:22] you better check up on the word
[9:26] now we find out this
[9:29] uh ecumenical council is what's it doing
[9:32] the bible he said does the bible say
[9:34] about this having a form of
[9:36] godliness but denying the power thereof
[9:41] naked church
[9:44] goers having a form of godliness but
[9:48] denying
[9:48] the power of the holy ghost which
[9:51] identifies jesus christ
[9:52] to his word how can a man claim to have
[9:56] the holy spirit and deny the very word
[9:58] which is the holy spirit
[10:01] how can a man do that his own testimony
[10:04] gives witness that he's not what he's
[10:07] supposed to be
[10:08] committing spiritual fornications
[10:11] denying the power of god
[10:13] paul said in second timothy third
[10:15] chapter that's what it would be said be
[10:17] heady high-minded
[10:19] i've got a doctor's degree at phdld to
[10:22] me that's further from god he was when
[10:23] you started
[10:25] yes that only takes you away from god
[10:28] don't bring you to god
[10:30] only one thing can draw you to god and
[10:32] that's the holy spirit by his word
[10:35] the holy spirit is a compass
[10:40] the north star is the word and the
[10:42] compass will only point to the north
[10:44] star
[10:45] and the holy ghost will only point you
[10:47] to the word not some ecumenical move
[10:50] not some denomination but to the word of
[10:53] god
[10:54] remember all the other stars shift with
[10:56] the world but the north star stays
[10:59] exactly because
[11:00] it's in the center and every other man's
[11:02] world will fail but god's word can't
[11:04] fail it's a north star
[11:06] centered it won't shift with the world
[11:08] no matter where the world is
[11:09] it remains the same yesterday today and
[11:11] forever
[11:13] and he is the word brother and sister i
[11:16] plead you in jesus name to consider this
[11:20] you believe me in what i've said in
[11:21] these years if god has proof what i've
[11:24] said has been the truth not me
[11:25] it's been his word that's done it then i
[11:27] plead you in jesus name to check on this
[11:31] don't be blind to these things it's
[11:32] right upon you
[11:35] remember the bible said in matthew 24 24
[11:37] that
[11:38] all whose names were not written in the
[11:41] lamb's book of life from the foundation
[11:42] the earth
[11:43] would take this mark only in the elected
[11:47] who's
[11:47] ordained to see it we'll see it the rest
[11:50] of them missing a million miles
[11:52] we see this big move set up now satan's
[11:55] big machinery set in order
[11:56] the only thing it needs is it's got the
[11:59] mechanics that only waiting for its
[12:00] dynamics
[12:01] to put it in force the moves all
[12:04] congregation a big council and they the
[12:07] big machines sitting there but they're
[12:08] waiting for the hour
[12:09] when the lead goes down and then they
[12:11] can make it enforce it
[12:13] make it a law look at the broadcasts and
[12:16] things we hear today over the radio and
[12:17] the newspapers
[12:18] why it's right on you now we haven't
[12:21] time to do nothing else but receive
[12:23] jesus christ
[12:24] he's been thoroughly identified listen
[12:27] we say about satan's big machine up
[12:29] there ready to move
[12:30] that's right to crush down but remember
[12:32] god's little flock that believes the
[12:34] word
[12:35] its mechanics is ready too it's ready
[12:37] for the dynamics to set it a fire with
[12:39] the holy ghost
[12:41] fear not little it's your father's
[12:42] good will to give you the kingdom
[12:44] the holy ghost will strike the little
[12:45] churches come out from the world
[12:48] women it wears long hair and nazarite to
[12:51] prove
[12:52] they separate themselves from the
[12:54] nazarite is
[12:55] one who what uh one that separates
[12:58] themselves from the word of god
[12:59] not sharp wearing painted faces jezebels
[13:02] calling themselves christians
[13:04] no sir man so wishy-washy that'll stand
[13:08] for a denomination to hold on to their
[13:09] coattails or some caesar or herod
[13:12] instead of standing for the word of god
[13:14] but god's got
[13:15] loyal people genuine luck of god who
[13:18] don't care what the world says they
[13:20] believe
[13:20] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[13:22] and forever
[13:24] this is not popular it makes you
[13:26] unpopular but it's the truth it's god's
[13:28] command for it to be done
[13:30] and god will do it god bless you i don't
[13:33] mean to scold you but to warn you
[13:36] it's better to be scorched and burned at
[13:38] any time so take warning
[13:40] the holy spirit speaks in the desires
[13:43] days
[13:44] always written in the book will escape
[13:46] it now we find out the little
[13:48] flock is ready for the dynamics to move
[13:51] it up in the skies to escape all this
[13:52] tribulation
[13:54] someone said the other day and i was
[13:55] talking said brother abraham you don't
[13:56] believe then the church will go through
[13:58] the tribulation i said i believe the
[13:59] church will but not the bride
[14:01] the church will go through the
[14:02] tribulation yes sir but the bride's free
[14:04] from it
[14:49] all that's written in the book will
[14:51] escape it now we find out the little
[14:53] flock
[14:53] is ready for the dynamics to move it up
[14:56] in the skies to escape all this
[14:58] tribulation
[14:59] someone said the other day and i was
[15:00] talking said brother abraham you don't
[15:02] believe then the church will go through
[15:03] the tribulation i said i believe the
[15:04] church will but not the bride
[15:06] the church will go through the
[15:07] tribulation yes sir but the bride's free
[15:09] from it
[15:10] she'll go on the rapture in a moment in
[15:12] a twinkling of an hour she'll be caught
[15:14] up to meet her lord
[15:14] in the air for the wedding supper she
[15:17] has nothing to go through any
[15:18] tribulation about
[15:19] her lord has paid her price we're so
[15:22] thankful for that
[15:23] yes sir after the rejects of both church
[15:26] and nation
[15:27] there was only one cry come the next
[15:29] move let's get rid of it
[15:31] that's the next cry we have the church
[15:34] has
[15:34] firmly turned down the holy spirit we
[15:37] know it has all members has come out of
[15:39] everything that's the great call
[15:40] presbyterian methodist baptist lutheran
[15:43] but the church itself the denomination
[15:45] it cannot move no sir it's already
[15:48] denominated
[15:49] what's the thing of it is now crucified
[15:51] crucify what crucifying afresh
[15:54] what the authenticated word to be the
[15:56] truth
[15:58] god's word crucify the flesh just as eve
[16:01] corrupted the whole
[16:02] physical world by rejecting one little
[16:05] bit of god's word
[16:06] so has the church did the same thing
[16:09] you may say to me brother branham you've
[16:12] got the wrong interpretation of it
[16:15] well that's to your opinion god don't
[16:17] need any interpreter
[16:19] god's his own interpreter that's what
[16:21] the trouble of it is today we got too
[16:23] many
[16:23] man-made interpreters god can interpret
[16:27] himself
[16:28] his own vindication of his word is the
[16:30] interpretation
[16:31] the pharisees might have cried out too
[16:33] we got the interpretation of sadducees
[16:35] says we
[16:36] got it but jesus was the interpretation
[16:40] amen the manifestation of god's revealed
[16:43] power
[16:44] promise is the vindication read the
[16:47] scriptures and see what the church is
[16:48] supposed to be today
[16:50] yes sir god don't need any interpreter
[16:54] let's say what they've done to jesus
[16:56] they found out back there that
[16:57] they thought he didn't have the
[16:58] interpretation he was the interpretation
[17:01] god didn't have to interpret it jesus
[17:03] life interpreted
[17:05] he said search the scriptures for in
[17:06] them you think you have eternal life
[17:08] they are they that testify me and if i
[17:11] do not the works of my father
[17:13] then believe me not if the works that we
[17:16] spoke of this day
[17:17] don't manifest itself in me he said then
[17:20] don't believe it
[17:21] did they do it god said a virgin shall
[17:24] conceive and she did
[17:27] you believe it certainly but they didn't
[17:30] a virgin shall conceive and she did
[17:34] it said the lame shall walk the blind
[17:36] shall see and
[17:37] what would take place it proved they
[17:39] would do it and
[17:41] jesus was a manifestation moses said the
[17:44] lord your god shall raise up a prophet
[17:46] like unto me the word comes to the
[17:48] prophet and the prophet
[17:50] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[17:52] of the heart
[17:53] when they see him doing that discernment
[17:54] they said this is beelzebub a fortune
[17:56] teller
[17:58] that's no more than a name depend on him
[18:00] the same thing today called a holy
[18:01] roller or something like that
[18:02] that's right though he needs no
[18:06] interpretation
[18:07] he was the interpretation god proved it
[18:09] by himself
[18:11] who is that sinful man today or who was
[18:14] that sinful man then
[18:15] that would deny that the word wasn't
[18:17] interpreted
[18:18] jesus asked them said search the
[18:20] scriptures they testify who i am
[18:22] they are the interpretation if my life
[18:25] doesn't interpret what i'm talking about
[18:27] then don't believe me what sinful man
[18:30] could there be today
[18:31] that could look in the face of the bible
[18:33] and see if the holy spirit isn't the
[18:34] interpreter of the word today
[18:36] making himself known by manifestations
[18:38] of promises of the gifts
[18:39] and the things that he promised to do in
[18:41] this day malachi
[18:42] 4 being fulfilled all the rest of
[18:45] scripture is being fulfilled
[18:46] and see it right here at the end of the
[18:48] time you don't need any man to interpret
[18:50] it
[18:50] no sir it interprets itself
[18:53] it proves it's the message of the hour
[18:56] repent and turn to god all the world
[19:00] you churches repent and turn to god
[19:03] don't try to wash him from your hands
[19:05] because you can't do it
[19:06] the issue is right on eyes it was in he
[19:09] said search the scriptures they testify
[19:11] me
[19:12] jesus said my works are my interpreter
[19:14] he told moses when he met him up there
[19:16] at the burning bush he said
[19:17] i am i remember my promise
[19:21] i remember that i'd take them people out
[19:23] by a mighty hand
[19:24] i made the promise and i'm going with
[19:27] you
[19:28] i'm sending you you just be my
[19:30] mouthpiece
[19:31] and the signs will interpret whether i
[19:32] sent you or not amen
[19:35] that's what men and women
[19:38] of another exodus and an interpretation
[19:41] of god's word
[19:42] being made manifest trouble with that
[19:44] today they say well my church don't
[19:46] believe this what's the matter you're
[19:47] living in a shadow of another age
[19:50] that churches are fine in their ages but
[19:52] what about this age
[19:54] this is another age you never make
[19:56] wesley believe on luther there wasn't
[19:58] sanctification no sir
[19:59] you never make the pentecostal believe
[20:01] on the baptise or like that go back to
[20:03] that
[20:03] they found something better they lived
[20:06] in the light of their day and today
[20:07] pentecost has organized and set right
[20:10] down like they did
[20:12] exactly the same thing and the words
[20:14] moving on and it's moving right away
[20:15] from them
[20:16] it's exactly ryan because we get so
[20:19] stiff and so
[20:20] starch we let our churches get in any
[20:21] kind of condition
[20:23] go right on as long as we got members
[20:24] that's always necessary
[20:26] because we got more we ever had we blow
[20:28] about that
[20:29] let me tell you something old proverb
[20:31] that the devil counts his crowd but gog
[20:34] weighs his
[20:35] that's true too yesterday but we should
[20:38] by his word
[20:39] see if you're found morning or not i
[20:41] don't care about crowds how many is how
[20:43] important it is
[20:44] it's god's word being made manifest for
[20:46] this hour
[20:48] exactly ryan we'll care about crowds and
[20:51] who comes and who doesn't it's god's
[20:53] words at stake like it was there in
[20:55] pilot's judgment hall
[20:57] wait and see what we found where we
[20:59] found wanting yes sir
[21:01] we believe that jesus christ is the same
[21:03] yesterday forever
[21:04] we find out that he told moses that i'll
[21:07] be with you
[21:09] and i'll just use your amount you go
[21:12] speak the words as i tell you and the
[21:15] signs will interpret themselves
[21:17] see god don't need no interpreter oh no
[21:19] he must be interpreter
[21:21] god interpret proves himself he said
[21:24] that he was the interpreter of his own
[21:26] word and he
[21:26] is he did it by moses and he does it
[21:28] today we
[21:30] know him in the bible as elohim elohim
[21:32] is the all-sufficient one
[21:34] he needs nobody's advice he stands alone
[21:38] he's god
[21:40] and he is the word and when the word
[21:43] promises something makes it identified
[21:45] before you what kind of an
[21:46] interpretation do you want outside of
[21:48] that
[21:48] oh sinful man or woman who are you that
[21:51] can rise up and say
[21:52] that it's wrong when god with his holy
[21:54] spirit and promised word
[21:56] interprets it in the face of every one
[21:58] of us
[21:59] who are we to say that it's wrong oh
[22:02] sinful person how can you do that
[22:04] sinful what do you mean by that brother
[22:05] branham unbelief there's only one sin
[22:08] that's unbelief
[22:10] need not still the interpretation he
[22:12] interprets his own
[22:14] i am the lord he said i planted it i'll
[22:17] water it day and night this sun should
[22:19] pluck it from my hand
[22:20] he also said in another scripture that
[22:22] he watched over his word to perform and
[22:25] perform it reveal it to what is elected
[22:28] to those that has sent the seed
[22:30] that's sent to see it rather he performs
[22:33] it to those who are
[22:34] sent to see it he watches over keeps it
[22:37] away from all these foolish carnal
[22:39] interpretations
[22:40] these things that this is right and
[22:41] that's right and that's right god's
[22:43] right
[22:45] god's identified person well then
[22:48] pharisees
[22:49] stood up and said we're of god we have
[22:51] the laws we have this and that
[22:52] stood the word itself said away with the
[22:56] crucified it don't identify itself
[22:58] with what we believe but it identified
[22:59] itself with the word
[23:01] amen amen those who had eyes to see saw
[23:03] it those who were blind did not see it
[23:05] neither will they do it today that's all
[23:07] they're going done
[23:08] seal themselves off many of them from
[23:11] away from it
[23:12] oh yes by fulfilling it showing it to be
[23:16] true some say i believe so much of it
[23:19] brother branham i can believe the bible
[23:21] i sympathize with the bible
[23:22] i'm a bible sympathizer i believe so and
[23:25] so i believe jesus christ is the son of
[23:26] god
[23:27] but i just can't believe all of it
[23:30] because my denomination
[23:31] says it's not so then what kind of an
[23:34] interpreter you got
[23:35] the same kind that eve had
[23:38] the devil he tried to interpret the word
[23:41] to eve
[23:43] and he said oh this is right and that's
[23:44] right but surely
[23:46] surely he's right what god says it's
[23:49] right i don't care
[23:50] how much it seems to others when god
[23:52] said it's going to happen it's going to
[23:53] be that way
[23:55] would you use eve's interpreter oh
[23:57] sinful person how could you do that
[23:59] yes sir they had got eve's interpreter
[24:02] the evidence as i've said other day we
[24:04] try to place evidence
[24:06] luther said believe and walk out the
[24:08] devil believes too
[24:10] wesley said shout you got it but he
[24:12] found out he didn't
[24:13] pentecost said speak in tongues and you
[24:14] got it they didn't
[24:16] christian science said love he got the
[24:17] fruit of the spirit but the heaven they
[24:19] denied the divinity of jesus christ
[24:21] what is the evidence of it when that
[24:24] spirit that's in you can punctuate every
[24:26] promise with
[24:26] amen that god will confirm it that's
[24:29] exactly the way it was with jesus christ
[24:32] oh yes they had they had more fruits of
[24:34] the spirit they had all kinds of
[24:35] evidences you can't pin any evidence
[24:37] down to anything but
[24:38] god himself manifests these words that's
[24:40] the only true evidence that there is
[24:43] that you're a christian how can you be a
[24:45] christian when in the beginning was the
[24:46] word and the word was with god
[24:48] and the word was god and the word was
[24:50] made
[24:51] flesh and dwelt among us the same
[24:53] yesterday today and forever
[24:55] he was the same god that was in david is
[24:57] the same one as in moses he was the same
[24:59] one with
[25:00] all the apostles and he's the same one
[25:02] that was in jesus christ to manifest
[25:03] himself there for that promised work
[25:05] and he's saying god today the same word
[25:09] throwing light upon the word of the hour
[25:11] god be merciful to us
[25:13] yes siren believing
[25:16] god to interpret himself every word to
[25:19] be
[25:19] vindicated yes he is his own interpreter
[25:23] brother i think of the hour i could stay
[25:26] on this a long time
[25:27] but you got a meeting coming i believe
[25:29] and i'm going to say today if we don't
[25:31] watch
[25:31] he's on the hands of we americans
[25:34] think of it i say this not for anger
[25:38] i say this for life i say that the blood
[25:42] of jesus christ is on the hand of the
[25:44] american church today
[25:46] the blood of jesus christ is on america
[25:48] whole
[25:49] the blood of jesus christ is against the
[25:51] methodist presbyterian lutheran
[25:53] pentecostals
[25:54] it's on the hands of all of us let's see
[25:57] if it is now
[25:58] think of it the blood of jesus christ
[26:01] oh my and his pilot that day
[26:04] it reminds me of three ways that pilas
[26:07] tried to get it off his hand
[26:09] he tried all three ways to get it off
[26:11] his hand but he failed
[26:13] there's only one way to take it off your
[26:15] hand let's see what he did
[26:17] pilate tried these three ways and they
[26:19] all failed we must face the issue we
[26:21] know a chair
[26:22] for his word has been identified by the
[26:25] scripture
[26:25] evidence the word promised for the day
[26:28] is made flesh even to the evil part
[26:31] of refusing jesus christ and him in this
[26:33] lady of sea and age on the outside of
[26:34] the church
[26:35] we know that's the truth think of it the
[26:38] blood of
[26:39] jesus christ god's son on our hands you
[26:42] that
[26:42] scares me to think of it to run through
[26:45] them and send
[26:46] shields that think the blood of jesus
[26:48] christ
[26:49] when a man will watch his own fellow
[26:51] man's blood one time in chicago not long
[26:53] ago a friend of mine was standing there
[26:55] one mother
[26:56] the dillinger outfit or whatever was
[26:57] shot out on the street
[26:59] people gathered up by the hundreds and
[27:00] they stood all around
[27:02] but they what did they do or that blood
[27:04] was sped out on the street in that
[27:05] bullet hole
[27:06] everybody walked around that blood they
[27:08] wouldn't step in their fellow man's
[27:10] blood oh no
[27:11] sir they're very suspicious of that but
[27:13] they'll walk right through the blood of
[27:15] jesus christ
[27:18] this old saying is still true fool's a
[27:20] walk with hobnailed shoes where angels
[27:22] fear the tron
[27:24] right they'll walk right over say the
[27:26] days of miracles has passed that was all
[27:27] right for the apostles but
[27:29] not for us oh my how can you say it
[27:32] you're trapping under the foot the blood
[27:34] of jesus christ
[27:35] wherewith you were sanctified with oh my
[27:38] thank you the blood on her hands what a
[27:40] man's fellow's blood
[27:41] i think about long goal a few weeks ago
[27:44] when we thought it couldn't happen in
[27:45] our nation what about this fellow oswald
[27:49] sitting there in that cell sweating it
[27:51] out
[27:52] if he's in his right mind not think of a
[27:55] man that would listen to this tape
[27:57] or setting presence or anywhere and
[27:59] listen to the message of proving it
[28:02] sweating it out knowing that you've got
[28:05] to come to
[28:06] judgment and answer to the word of god
[28:10] answer to the blood of jesus christ
[28:12] which you've been introduced to
[28:14] on your hands on our hands
[28:17] notice oswald sitting there what an
[28:19] awful thing it should ought to be into
[28:21] him or it would have been
[28:22] or i guess it was when he thought that
[28:24] he would face an
[28:26] angry supreme court with the anger of
[28:29] murdering their president there would be
[28:31] no mercy
[28:33] any evidence they could get against me
[28:34] if he crammed against him
[28:37] fingerprints gun place he was at all to
[28:40] be brought before him
[28:42] that's a mild thing to what it's going
[28:44] to be the people who set these meetings
[28:45] once jesus christ rise in the form of
[28:48] his being and identify himself and you
[28:51] walk out without acceptance
[28:53] hold into some little creed or something
[28:55] that you call petty
[28:58] that'll be a mild thing when you sit in
[29:00] the presence of angry
[29:02] god who's trapped you have pranked the
[29:04] blood of his own son and crucified him
[29:07] afresh in your mind
[29:08] swapped your birthrights for a
[29:10] popularity
[29:13] it's going to be a terrible thing on
[29:14] that day it'd be a horrible thought
[29:17] how can you shine a sweat cell
[29:21] you natives in africa you in australia
[29:23] sweden switzerland
[29:24] you listen to this tape how are you
[29:27] going to answer in the day of judgment
[29:28] when i've been in your nations and
[29:30] you've seen the identification
[29:32] of jesus christ rising among the people
[29:34] and proving himself
[29:37] sweat my he must have sweated out oh how
[29:40] could he do it
[29:41] if he was in his right mind what kind of
[29:45] a
[29:45] angry god do you think it'll be to those
[29:48] who have trod underfoot
[29:49] the son of god and crucified him afresh
[29:52] again
[29:54] notice a pilot when he gets ready to
[29:56] take a plane up
[29:58] a pilot will take a plane out he'll
[30:00] check everything before he leaves
[30:02] every instrument you go out on the
[30:03] runway and stand out there
[30:05] check those wing flaps check his gasket
[30:08] everything every instrument he's got he
[30:09] checks it over and over
[30:12] many of his flowing in planes and you
[30:14] know that's the truth he checks every
[30:16] instrument
[30:16] why he's got the blood of his fellow man
[30:18] upon his hands
[30:20] he wants to be sure that everything
[30:22] possible is running right
[30:24] how about a doctor in an operation when
[30:27] he knows that he's going to operate
[30:29] take a tumor or a heart or something
[30:31] other than operate on it
[30:32] when he's going to operate on your body
[30:34] he'll check your heart you'll check your
[30:36] blood pressure he'll check whether he
[30:37] got any cold
[30:38] check the nsx he checks everything over
[30:41] and over and over again
[30:42] why you don't want the blood of his
[30:44] fellow man upon his hand
[30:46] if a doctrine of pilot and so forth will
[30:48] check for
[30:49] the church of jesus christ to do when we
[30:52] see the things that we're living in
[30:54] today
[30:55] we'd better check the blood of jesus
[30:57] christ
[30:58] might be left upon our hands now let's
[31:00] take one thing
[31:01] pilate's first scheme was i find no
[31:04] fault in him
[31:06] how that is amongst many of the fine
[31:07] groups today i find no fault in the word
[31:10] it's all right but that was for the
[31:12] apostles
[31:13] the bible said he's the same yesterday
[31:15] today and forever
[31:18] you say that bible is all right i
[31:19] believe they spoke in tongues
[31:21] i believe they cast out devils i believe
[31:23] they discerned the thoughts i believe
[31:24] they were prophets
[31:25] but not this day oh mister
[31:29] sinful man what's the matter with you
[31:32] what happens when matthew 28 uh 24
[31:36] 24 lays right back hebrews 13 8 flies
[31:40] right
[31:40] back in your lap again pilate he
[31:43] couldn't wash it from his hands like
[31:45] that
[31:45] nosher come right back in his lap again
[31:48] so will it to every man when you stood
[31:49] and seen
[31:50] god keep his promise peter said on the
[31:52] day of pentecost
[31:53] repent every one of you and be baptized
[31:56] in the name of jesus christ for the
[31:57] remission of sins
[31:58] and you shall receive the gift of the
[32:00] holy ghost father
[32:01] promises unto you and your children and
[32:03] them that are far off even as many as
[32:05] the lord our god shall call
[32:07] how far to all the world every nation
[32:10] amen to every nation
[32:14] go into all the world it hasn't reached
[32:16] their head preach the gospel to every
[32:18] creature
[32:19] these signs shall follow them i believe
[32:23] how you don't wash it from your hands
[32:25] you cannot do it
[32:27] it's a vindicated throw right back in
[32:29] your lap it backfires just like it did
[32:31] on pilate
[32:32] oh yes sir it comes right back to you
[32:34] again when you see the scripture
[32:36] identified right before you secondly as
[32:38] we're closing
[32:39] secondly we find out there was another
[32:41] way as pilate tried to do so does people
[32:44] they pass it on to his herods and
[32:46] caesars
[32:49] many fine ministers today episcopalian
[32:52] presbyterian lutheran baptist
[32:55] pentecostals and so forth
[32:57] i'll pass it on my headquarters is the
[33:00] one won't let me do it
[33:01] it backfired it's backfiring again today
[33:06] i'm not asking the assemblies of god the
[33:08] oneness
[33:09] the church of god the methodist the
[33:11] baptist the presbyterian i'm asking you
[33:13] as an individual
[33:14] what do you do with the blood of jesus
[33:16] christ
[33:17] what will we do with this anointed word
[33:19] of god that's right before us today
[33:22] that we know is to be is the christ the
[33:24] promise of the hour
[33:26] what will you do with it not what your
[33:28] church does with it
[33:29] your caesar your heart has nothing to do
[33:32] with it
[33:34] that didn't excuse pilate no sir no sir
[33:38] that pharisees and that day he said let
[33:40] his blood be upon us no our children
[33:43] it is exactly
[33:46] what did jesus tell him you can discern
[33:49] the face of the skies
[33:51] but you can't discern the signs of the
[33:53] time
[33:54] no i don't say this for a penis god said
[33:57] for anyone who wants to go to
[33:58] you blind pharisees how can you
[34:01] spend in millions of dollars you can
[34:03] discern communism
[34:05] but the word of god have vindicated for
[34:07] the hour you cannot discern you're
[34:09] crucifying it again
[34:12] you know all about communism you know
[34:14] your bible you know things got to happen
[34:17] that's not interesting to me i hate
[34:19] communism
[34:21] i hate anything against god but what my
[34:24] interest is
[34:24] is this the church being ready for this
[34:27] hour
[34:28] for the going away of the bride
[34:31] discern the face of the skies but the
[34:33] signs of the time you cannot discern
[34:36] an honest trial it is in the federal
[34:38] courts to make these
[34:39] council of churches and everything you
[34:41] can discern communism
[34:49] [Music]
[35:24] you
