[1:06:44] uh the book of efficient actually
[1:06:50] is a book that shows the believer's
[1:06:52] position
[1:06:54] because our position
[1:06:57] is our power
[1:07:00] the lord
[1:07:01] our position is our power
[1:07:04] and uh
[1:07:06] and we we

[1:07:48] to lead us
[1:07:50] this morning
[1:07:54] let's read from verse 17.
[1:08:00] let's read from verse 17.
[1:08:05] that christ made the word in your heart
[1:08:08] by faith
[1:08:10] that the year being rooted and grounded
[1:08:13] in love
[1:08:14] may be able to comprehend with all the
[1:08:18] sins
[1:08:19] what is the birth
[1:08:21] the length the depth and the height
[1:08:29] and to know
[1:08:31] the love of christ
[1:08:33] which passes knowledge
[1:08:36] that he might be filled
[1:08:39] with all the fullness of god
[1:08:45] praise the lord
[1:08:47] amen let's uh uh go to uh
[1:08:52] revelation chapter 2.
[1:08:54] let's go to revelation chapter 2.
[1:09:11] let's go to revelation chapter 2 let's
[1:09:13] read from verse 24.
[1:09:26] born to you
[1:09:28] i said and on to the rest
[1:09:31] of tara
[1:09:32] terra as many as have met this doctrine
[1:09:38] and which have not known
[1:09:42] the depths
[1:09:43] of satan
[1:09:45] as they speak
[1:09:47] i will put upon you none other
[1:09:51] burden
[1:09:53] but that wish ye have already hold fast
[1:09:57] till
[1:09:58] i come
[1:10:00] praise the lord
[1:10:03] now over in uh
[1:10:04] ephesians paul
[1:10:07] is telling us how
[1:10:09] we will be able to comprehend with all
[1:10:11] the sins
[1:10:12] what is
[1:10:14] the birth the length the depth
[1:10:17] and the height of god
[1:10:20] and here in the church ages here
[1:10:23] john
[1:10:25] by the spirit of christ or christ is
[1:10:27] speaking to the church
[1:10:29] and also
[1:10:31] making us to know
[1:10:33] that
[1:10:34] there is a depth of satan
[1:10:38] that
[1:10:39] we have not known
[1:10:42] praise the lord
[1:10:43] if we have the slight idea
[1:10:46] what plan the devil have for your life
[1:10:49] you will stick to this altar until you
[1:10:52] can have more of god than you came in
[1:10:54] here with
[1:10:57] well one thing i want others to realize
[1:10:59] is that when paul talks about the depth
[1:11:02] of god
[1:11:04] it's just a depth
[1:11:06] when jesus
[1:11:08] talks about
[1:11:09] the depth of satan is depth
[1:11:13] so
[1:11:14] the depth of god is just one dip
[1:11:17] you just have to be emerged one time
[1:11:21] you can go no deeper
[1:11:24] than just jumping in
[1:11:27] amen
[1:11:28] but the depths of satan
[1:11:31] have layers
[1:11:33] you can go from one worst state to
[1:11:35] another world state
[1:11:37] into a miserable state
[1:11:39] into a horrible state
[1:11:41] let's buy our house together
[1:11:43] as we trust the lord to speak to us this
[1:11:45] morning father
[1:11:47] we have read your sacred word
[1:11:49] and oh god we want to ask your holy
[1:11:51] spirit lord
[1:11:53] father to coming in
[1:11:55] and come out of the pages of your word
[1:11:57] this morning
[1:11:59] father lord garden and just coming and
[1:12:02] break the word to our house lord you
[1:12:04] know our individual needs
[1:12:07] you know our need as a body
[1:12:09] you know our need as a family of god you
[1:12:12] know our need as the bride of jesus
[1:12:14] christ on the face of the earth
[1:12:17] we just pray father the lord
[1:12:20] this few time that is before us lost
[1:12:22] something will be said
[1:12:24] of internal glory that will bring us a
[1:12:27] little closer to you
[1:12:28] we love you we appreciate you father in
[1:12:31] jesus name amen the lord bless you you
[1:12:34] may have your seed
[1:12:39] praise the lord
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:53] now so uh
[1:12:55] uh like we were we were talking and uh
[1:12:57] you know the bulk of efficient
[1:12:59] you look at the bulk of efficient you
[1:13:01] realize that a poor year
[1:13:05] from chapter one
[1:13:07] he starts to speak about how
[1:13:09] we were chosen in god from the
[1:13:11] foundation of the word
[1:13:13] and you see he he brings us right from
[1:13:16] the mind of god
[1:13:18] uh
[1:13:19] i mean if you if you follow
[1:13:22] uh
[1:13:23] you know like like brother branham says
[1:13:25] the the god is a god of of of uh
[1:13:29] you know of portrait he's a god of arch
[1:13:32] there is there is beautiful design in
[1:13:35] god's word beautiful picture the moment
[1:13:37] you grab the picture and you just follow
[1:13:39] it you know i used to have a friend
[1:13:42] brother kenneth a brother back in
[1:13:44] nigeria he was he was very good in arts
[1:13:48] but his arts always have a message
[1:13:52] and and when he paint his picture
[1:13:54] unless you are a person of arts that is
[1:13:57] able to read
[1:13:58] picture it's hard for you to see what he
[1:14:00] paints
[1:14:01] you know sometimes i just look at
[1:14:04] and crack my mind and try to look at him
[1:14:07] saying no i'm not getting it
[1:14:09] you know then he would just tell me it's
[1:14:12] a man that is buying before the cross
[1:14:16] then i step back again
[1:14:19] and then i start to picture the cross
[1:14:22] and then i see the head of the man i
[1:14:24] said oh i see it
[1:14:26] you know he just had a classic way of
[1:14:28] doing his acts it was very classic acts
[1:14:31] that he would do you know he'd be able
[1:14:32] to bring up bring out a man and and
[1:14:35] different things you know the cross
[1:14:37] bleeding with blood and different things
[1:14:39] he would do and that's the same thing
[1:14:41] with god's word that a beautiful picture
[1:14:43] in the word of god and until the holy
[1:14:45] spirit helped us to be able to see it
[1:14:48] we would just be looking at verses
[1:14:50] that's what some people would think it's
[1:14:52] just a bunch of rules and a bunch of
[1:14:54] laws and you know uh uh you know and and
[1:14:58] the thing that is depriving them
[1:15:00] actually from living a bed of life
[1:15:02] whereby it's actually trying to make you
[1:15:05] free for you to enjoy the life that you
[1:15:08] have amen that's what the word is this
[1:15:10] is bringing liberty to you for you to be
[1:15:13] able to enjoy the time that is given to
[1:15:16] you upon this earth
[1:15:18] now so uh
[1:15:20] [Music]
[1:15:22] uh when you look at the book of
[1:15:25] ephesians just like i said uh we've been
[1:15:28] talking about
[1:15:29] possessing our inheritance and reward
[1:15:32] and you know enjoying and all of that
[1:15:35] and paul brings us to this place where
[1:15:37] he takes us right back to our our our
[1:15:42] original identity he takes us back to
[1:15:45] the mind of god that you cannot be here
[1:15:48] today and and and be serving god and
[1:15:52] have a heart to serve god unless god has
[1:15:55] chosen you from the foundation of the
[1:15:57] word amen
[1:15:58] right right in in the back part of god's
[1:16:01] mind so uh
[1:16:03] uh he brings us from there you see
[1:16:05] chapter 1
[1:16:07] and then chapter 2
[1:16:09] what paul did actually in chapter 2 is
[1:16:12] that he wakes us up to the reality
[1:16:16] chapter 2 verse 1 he says
[1:16:19] you and you have he quickly
[1:16:22] who were dead in sin and trespass
[1:16:25] quickie means to wake up
[1:16:29] so he wakes us up to the reality
[1:16:32] of what we wear before the foundation of
[1:16:35] the world
[1:16:38] praise the lord because he talks about
[1:16:41] being being been uh
[1:16:43] having all of this heavenly blessing in
[1:16:45] christ jesus he has chosen us before the
[1:16:49] foundation of the world that we should
[1:16:51] be holy we have no idea about that we
[1:16:54] can reconcile our present life to what
[1:16:57] paul is saying in chapter one
[1:17:00] there is no way we can reconcile that
[1:17:03] we know our past and we know the things
[1:17:05] that we have done
[1:17:06] you ask yourself but then how how
[1:17:10] how did i went down this path how did
[1:17:12] this happen to me when paul is saying
[1:17:15] here that i was choosing from the
[1:17:17] foundation of the word
[1:17:20] praise the lord
[1:17:23] then he comes here to verse two he said
[1:17:25] what is happening is that you are coming
[1:17:28] from out of a deep sleep
[1:17:31] you have been quaking
[1:17:34] who was once dead in sin and trespass
[1:17:38] you just coming from out of a deep sleep
[1:17:40] you got to clean your eyes
[1:17:43] amen
[1:17:44] whip your mouth because there's a lot of
[1:17:46] drools all around your mouth
[1:17:49] [Laughter]
[1:17:51] ever come out of a deep sleep and you
[1:17:52] don't know where you are
[1:17:54] when you are in your own bedroom the
[1:17:57] very bed that you made with your hands
[1:18:00] praise the lord
[1:18:03] so paul comes and he talks about how we
[1:18:06] have been quicking we that were once
[1:18:08] dead in sin and trespassed we're in time
[1:18:11] past our past life we walk our calling
[1:18:15] to the curse of this world i call into
[1:18:17] the praise of the power of air the
[1:18:19] spirit that now worketh in the children
[1:18:22] of disobedience
[1:18:24] so now he says god
[1:18:26] is waking us out of that he's he's he's
[1:18:29] bringing us out of there and then in
[1:18:32] chapter three he did something beautiful
[1:18:36] in chapter three what prophet here is
[1:18:39] the other
[1:18:41] uh
[1:18:42] uh
[1:18:43] i think it's over in in in verse 15.
[1:18:48] in chapter three
[1:18:51] in verse 14 he says for this cause i bow
[1:18:54] my knees unto the father
[1:18:57] of our lord jesus christ
[1:19:01] of whom
[1:19:03] the whole family
[1:19:05] in heaven
[1:19:06] and earth his name
[1:19:09] so what paul is doing here in chapter 3
[1:19:12] as you read along
[1:19:13] he's bringing his he's introducing us
[1:19:16] into the family
[1:19:18] of god
[1:19:21] the entire family of god in heaven and
[1:19:24] earth is named jesus christ
[1:19:26] that god's family name
[1:19:29] that's what the scripture says i don't
[1:19:31] know what i'm reading the same thing
[1:19:32] you're reading
[1:19:34] oh praise the lord
[1:19:36] so he says now we've been introduced
[1:19:39] into that family
[1:19:42] and uh uh
[1:19:44] then he goes he goes and and that's what
[1:19:48] he's saying here
[1:19:50] if we will be able to comprehend
[1:19:53] with all the saints
[1:19:56] you know
[1:19:57] what is the breath
[1:20:00] and the length
[1:20:02] and the height and the depths of these
[1:20:06] things that we are talking about
[1:20:09] they are not enough to understand verse
[1:20:12] by verse
[1:20:14] it's an entire word it's an entire
[1:20:17] dimension it's the entire universe that
[1:20:20] is around us
[1:20:23] of where he took us from
[1:20:25] where we are now
[1:20:27] and where we are going to
[1:20:29] is that it's an entire world around us
[1:20:33] praise the lord so paul
[1:20:35] just like jesus gave the the parable of
[1:20:38] the good samaritan paul noun is saying
[1:20:41] that you that were predestinated from
[1:20:44] the foundation of the word god is now
[1:20:46] waking you up to that reality he has
[1:20:49] introduced you into the body of jesus
[1:20:52] christ now he's trusting you over to a
[1:20:56] fightful ministry
[1:20:58] that's why we come in the next chapter
[1:21:05] amen
[1:21:07] now he have this this this ministry
[1:21:10] around just like the the full gospel
[1:21:14] protects the book of acts
[1:21:20] the full gospel protects the book of
[1:21:22] acts so paul is saying
[1:21:24] god are predestinated from the
[1:21:27] foundation of the world and and and we
[1:21:30] really can relate to that because we are
[1:21:32] coming from sin and trespass he has
[1:21:35] redeemed us introduce us into his body
[1:21:37] put us into the family give us the
[1:21:40] family name amen oh my goodness how can
[1:21:44] we forsake the family name and take
[1:21:46] baptists and take melodies and take
[1:21:48] catholic
[1:21:49] i'm a baptist i'm a meredith i'm a
[1:21:51] catholic
[1:21:53] praise the lord
[1:21:54] i'm a message believer
[1:21:58] there's a name that is better than all
[1:22:00] of those names
[1:22:02] the family name is the lord jesus christ
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:07] praise the
[1:22:08] lord amen
[1:22:12] now so he says yeah there and now he's
[1:22:15] he's going to trust us you know uh into
[1:22:18] uh because because he's he's having the
[1:22:21] picture there's a mystery that's a
[1:22:22] mystery he talks about in chapter five
[1:22:25] you know uh uh uh
[1:22:27] he said this is a mystery a man and his
[1:22:30] wife christ and his bride you know in
[1:22:32] all of that but it comes through all of
[1:22:34] this you know it comes through
[1:22:36] out of this that he's talking about here
[1:22:39] so what actually the apostle paul is
[1:22:42] doing is trying to show us our position
[1:22:45] because that's where our power is
[1:22:49] you know bible talks about that you know
[1:22:51] police man on the street he don't even
[1:22:53] have a muscle his clothes are flying on
[1:22:55] him because he's so lean and and uh he
[1:22:59] have to hold his heart when the wind is
[1:23:01] blowing but he have such a power because
[1:23:04] of of what he represent
[1:23:08] and just by the waving of his hand every
[1:23:10] car coming down the road has to stop
[1:23:13] so his position has given him that power
[1:23:23] praise the lord
[1:23:25] and that's the same way our position in
[1:23:27] christ
[1:23:32] has given us
[1:23:36] the authority
[1:23:37] that we express
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:41] the authority
[1:23:43] that we express
[1:23:46] praise the lord
[1:23:49] amen
[1:23:52] so if the bride knows her position
[1:23:54] the rapture will go
[1:23:58] glory be to god
[1:24:00] i don't think time will be able to allow
[1:24:02] us to to exhaust what we want to go into
[1:24:05] this morning but we will trust the lord
[1:24:08] and uh uh whatever is our lot whatever
[1:24:11] is our uh our portion he will be able to
[1:24:14] help us praise the lord so we want to
[1:24:17] look at
[1:24:19] the depth of god
[1:24:22] and the depths
[1:24:24] of satan
[1:24:27] praise the lord
[1:24:29] the death of god
[1:24:31] what is this
[1:24:33] height
[1:24:34] what is this length
[1:24:36] what is this breath
[1:24:39] what is this depth
[1:24:42] of god
[1:24:43] that's what we want to look at and we
[1:24:45] just
[1:24:46] just uh
[1:24:48] praying and hoping that uh
[1:24:50] we have will find grace this morning to
[1:24:53] be able to
[1:24:56] to uh to go into death
[1:24:59] praise the lord
[1:25:02] now so you see uh uh uh uh we we will uh
[1:25:06] we take uh our inspiration is is from
[1:25:09] the church ages we still dwelling on
[1:25:11] church history
[1:25:13] and
[1:25:15] because i believe that is is very
[1:25:18] important
[1:25:19] it's very very important for us
[1:25:21] now so uh uh
[1:25:26] there is there is a scriptural principle
[1:25:29] you know uh that brother branham
[1:25:31] expressed how
[1:25:33] how he came and to be able to draw the
[1:25:36] conclusion with uh getting the the the
[1:25:39] ages
[1:25:40] you know and and the messenger of of the
[1:25:44] church ages
[1:25:45] praise the lord
[1:25:47] now you see some of these things on that
[1:25:50] are now very unique to brother branham
[1:25:52] because that is the reason why people
[1:25:55] will think you know that uh uh uh
[1:25:59] [Music]
[1:26:02] you know
[1:26:03] uh they would take their brother brandon
[1:26:04] and pressurize
[1:26:06] because if you go back and look at uh uh
[1:26:10] where is where is the guy name
[1:26:12] uh
[1:26:14] i can't remember his name charles
[1:26:16] you go back and look at what he drew out
[1:26:19] for the church ages
[1:26:21] it comes very it comes very close
[1:26:24] it pretty much looks like the same map
[1:26:26] that brother brandon drew out now you
[1:26:28] have to realize that uh these men were
[1:26:31] before brother branham these were people
[1:26:33] that were in the 1800s you know they
[1:26:36] were preachers just like i said that was
[1:26:38] the age of the man's anointing there are
[1:26:41] men that were able to get into into the
[1:26:44] word of god you know when and and god
[1:26:46] blessed him with such and brother
[1:26:48] branham and brother brandon mentioned
[1:26:50] them you know brother brandon mentioned
[1:26:51] them you find them right through the
[1:26:53] message you know and i i just saw one
[1:26:56] and i was looking into some of his
[1:26:58] material saying oh my goodness you know
[1:27:00] uh
[1:27:01] but it's it's completely different
[1:27:04] from a divine revelation
[1:27:07] as he drew out the church ages you look
[1:27:09] at his picture of the church ages he
[1:27:12] never was able to come out with the
[1:27:14] messenger of the age
[1:27:18] praise the lord
[1:27:20] he couldn't determine you know uh
[1:27:23] uh because the uh the the way
[1:27:26] that there are many you remaining uh uh
[1:27:30] uh how you call in there no
[1:27:33] you me you read many writers
[1:27:35] you will you will realize the other you
[1:27:38] know uh uh they knew that this the the
[1:27:42] seven church ages were uh uh once one
[1:27:46] said he says uh you know we get it wrong
[1:27:49] when we think that there is only 27
[1:27:51] books in the new testament we try we we
[1:27:54] we turn not to see the seven letters
[1:27:57] that jesus wrote to the seven church
[1:27:59] ages
[1:28:01] you know and uh
[1:28:03] uh and
[1:28:04] and
[1:28:05] there is there is another commentary uh
[1:28:07] uh he he also said he said you know
[1:28:11] those were uh
[1:28:13] church conditions
[1:28:17] those were church conditions not only
[1:28:19] just churches that was existing
[1:28:22] but there were church conditions that
[1:28:24] would be reflected
[1:28:26] on the edge
[1:28:29] praise the lord
[1:28:30] amen i was reading another coming
[1:28:32] trading and he says he says uh and he
[1:28:35] talks about all the mystery you know the
[1:28:37] the mystery of the kingdom and the
[1:28:39] mystery and it was so amazing you know i
[1:28:42] was and he says and all of this mystery
[1:28:46] we end in revelation 10 7.
[1:28:51] praise the lord
[1:28:53] amen
[1:28:54] so i mean it will be a gross error
[1:28:58] for us
[1:28:59] to just believe that
[1:29:01] you know it take take for example it's
[1:29:04] almost like
[1:29:06] elijah
[1:29:08] was going to be taken away
[1:29:10] but the sons of the prophet knew
[1:29:15] they told elijah you know that your
[1:29:17] master will be taken away
[1:29:21] the new
[1:29:26] praise the lord
[1:29:27] amen
[1:29:28] so you see uh uh and and and and that is
[1:29:32] the place where
[1:29:34] you know if if a man do not understand
[1:29:37] you know uh uh the ministry of the hour
[1:29:40] the man do now understand how god deals
[1:29:43] with his man you will stumble and say
[1:29:45] well i thought these things were because
[1:29:48] what most people think they think that
[1:29:50] these things uh uh are just divine
[1:29:54] revelation given to brother brandon no
[1:29:57] you have to remember church the met the
[1:29:59] ministry of brother branham was to tie
[1:30:02] the loose ends so there were things that
[1:30:04] were already there that he brings
[1:30:07] together honor his ministry to make
[1:30:09] perfect sense
[1:30:12] it was not to bring new things that were
[1:30:14] not there
[1:30:22] it was to tie the loose ants so there
[1:30:25] were things that were giving to men
[1:30:27] through the ages just like down here he
[1:30:29] said seal it for the time of the end
[1:30:34] so it was given to down there but it was
[1:30:36] loose
[1:30:37] because that was not the time
[1:30:48] praise the lord
[1:30:50] now so uh
[1:30:52] uh yeah you get into this thing i've
[1:30:55] lost my thoughts but it's okay
[1:30:58] now so you you you know you you look at
[1:31:01] these things
[1:31:02] okay yeah i was kind of for talking
[1:31:04] about i was going to talk about the
[1:31:05] keystone revelation
[1:31:07] and uh so you you look at these things
[1:31:10] and you see
[1:31:12] especially for you young people
[1:31:15] you are in a challenging
[1:31:18] age you are in a challenging
[1:31:19] dispensation
[1:31:21] most of the men that
[1:31:23] that you know that have tapped into the
[1:31:25] revival you know the man that
[1:31:28] you know uh uh experience uh the
[1:31:31] supernatural most of them are going off
[1:31:34] the scene
[1:31:36] praise the lord
[1:31:37] amen where we i mean uh
[1:31:41] uh the age is left with the holy ghost
[1:31:44] though the holy ghost has always his uh
[1:31:46] we want to thank god that we have the
[1:31:47] holy ghost amen we want to thank god
[1:31:49] that the holy ghost have not been lifted
[1:31:51] off the earth because uh no matter what
[1:31:54] we have if we don't have the holy ghost
[1:31:56] we are just just like a cop that is
[1:31:58] dressed very well and lying in the
[1:32:00] coffin
[1:32:01] you know so uh uh so i mean there's
[1:32:04] there's uh we must we must thank god
[1:32:06] that we have the holy ghost to be able
[1:32:08] to lead us through but what i mean is
[1:32:11] that
[1:32:12] you know uh uh
[1:32:14] uh we we we we need the grace of god to
[1:32:19] that you know to to to bring men to be
[1:32:22] able to
[1:32:23] to to channel our
[1:32:25] you know to be able to understand
[1:32:28] you know uh
[1:32:30] uh what what god is doing in our period
[1:32:33] of time
[1:32:34] because we have all of those things out
[1:32:36] there that can challenge our beliefs
[1:32:39] if you if you are not grounded in the
[1:32:41] word and really being taught
[1:32:43] how to understand these things then you
[1:32:46] start getting confused
[1:32:48] praise the lord you start getting
[1:32:49] confused oh i thought i thought brother
[1:32:51] branham was the one that talked about
[1:32:52] the separation jesus preaches seven
[1:32:54] seeing it's in john chapter eight
[1:32:59] he preached the serpent see the
[1:33:00] pharisees says we we are not born
[1:33:03] out of fornication
[1:33:04] when jesus was talking about the father
[1:33:06] in the beginning
[1:33:09] so it's a talk that has been around all
[1:33:11] this long
[1:33:18] are we together amen
[1:33:20] so uh uh uh
[1:33:23] you know uh let's
[1:33:25] let's just let's just trust and and
[1:33:27] believe that the lord the lord is
[1:33:29] faithful amen he that have called us is
[1:33:32] faithful
[1:33:33] praise the lord he's faithful and to be
[1:33:36] able to carry us even on to the end
[1:33:39] amen amen to help your friend let him
[1:33:41] wake up
[1:33:44] praise the lord
[1:33:46] now so uh uh
[1:33:52] but branham talks about uh uh
[1:33:55] the keystone revelation here let's let's
[1:33:57] just read that it's part of our
[1:33:59] efficient church age
[1:34:01] uh uh reading year the key given to me
[1:34:06] of the law whereby i was able to
[1:34:08] determine the messenger
[1:34:11] of
[1:34:12] of each age
[1:34:15] is a most spiritual one in fact it might
[1:34:18] be called the keystone of the bible
[1:34:22] it is the revelation
[1:34:23] that god never
[1:34:26] changed amen
[1:34:28] praise the lord we are serving an
[1:34:30] unchanging god
[1:34:33] and that his ways
[1:34:35] are as unchangeable
[1:34:38] as he is
[1:34:41] praise the lord
[1:34:43] god do not change
[1:34:46] amen
[1:34:48] and the ways that he does things it do
[1:34:50] not change
[1:34:52] but we also
[1:34:53] have to remember
[1:34:56] that
[1:34:57] people that he uses change
[1:35:01] but the way that he does things
[1:35:04] do not change
[1:35:08] praise the lord
[1:35:09] he had a noah with a boat he had an
[1:35:12] abraham to hold on to the promise he had
[1:35:15] a moses that went through the red seat
[1:35:18] you know that's what brother branham who
[1:35:19] says that moses could not say let's bail
[1:35:22] a boat to go
[1:35:25] because it was not his age it was not
[1:35:27] what god was doing at a time
[1:35:30] but it was the same god the same
[1:35:32] unchanging god
[1:35:35] praise the lord
[1:35:37] amen because the way people understand
[1:35:41] god
[1:35:42] not changing
[1:35:44] their their whole picture in their mind
[1:35:47] and expect it to be just like the way he
[1:35:50] did it no you got to watch the
[1:35:53] characteristics
[1:35:57] praise the lord
[1:35:59] amen
[1:36:00] we have seasons
[1:36:04] that was one of the things he told noah
[1:36:06] after the act the end of the act he says
[1:36:08] as long as the earth remains
[1:36:12] summer winter spring harvest all of
[1:36:15] these seasons will be there
[1:36:20] amen
[1:36:21] all of these seasons will be there and
[1:36:23] we have all of these cycles in our lives
[1:36:33] praise the lord
[1:36:38] here is it and on changing god
[1:36:40] wave on changing ways what he did at the
[1:36:44] first
[1:36:45] he will
[1:36:46] have to keep on doing until
[1:36:49] it is done the last time there will
[1:36:52] never be a change
[1:36:54] applied there to the church ages the
[1:36:57] kind of a man
[1:36:59] that that god choose for the first age
[1:37:03] and how god manifested
[1:37:06] in that man's ministry will be the
[1:37:10] example for all the other ages
[1:37:14] praise the lord
[1:37:16] now you have to hold that you think
[1:37:18] about that
[1:37:20] the first messenger was paul
[1:37:23] praise the lord
[1:37:25] amen
[1:37:28] he was the first messenger to the
[1:37:29] gentile age but you realize that uh
[1:37:33] uh i mean in in the level that that god
[1:37:36] uh uh dare with paul
[1:37:39] you know uh one one of the ways to to
[1:37:41] understand race is is with moses and and
[1:37:45] joshua
[1:37:49] it was god that told joshua i would be
[1:37:52] with you as i was with moses
[1:37:56] praise the lord
[1:37:58] but god joshua never had to go and meet
[1:38:01] pharaoh
[1:38:03] joshua never brought plagueis upon the
[1:38:06] earth
[1:38:08] amen
[1:38:10] praise the lord
[1:38:12] moses
[1:38:13] stretched his rod over the red sea the
[1:38:15] sea parted
[1:38:17] when it came to joshua time he said let
[1:38:20] the levites go before us
[1:38:24] and when the levi stepped on the water
[1:38:26] the jordan also parted
[1:38:28] but it was the same god
[1:38:32] the principle there is that uh
[1:38:35] moses had a challenge and god came down
[1:38:39] amen identify himself with moses and
[1:38:42] took him through his challenge if joshua
[1:38:45] would have a challenge the same god
[1:38:47] would do the same thing not definitely
[1:38:50] in the same way
[1:38:52] but he remains the same
[1:38:54] that is the principle
[1:38:56] if god brought uh uh
[1:38:59] uh
[1:39:00] peter out of praising by an angel and he
[1:39:03] walked through the wall the wall through
[1:39:05] the prison gates they came outside it
[1:39:07] was god that delivered him if we are
[1:39:10] bound with spirits in our life that same
[1:39:13] god can bring us out of the prison of
[1:39:16] depression he can bring us out of the
[1:39:18] prison of habits he can bring us out of
[1:39:21] whatever prison it is that is the
[1:39:23] principle
[1:39:30] that's the principle
[1:39:33] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:39:36] and forever
[1:39:40] are we together
[1:39:46] so the kind of a way
[1:39:48] praise the lord
[1:39:51] the kind of a way
[1:39:52] where you can get into an impersonation
[1:39:56] to be like paul it will now work
[1:40:00] because you say y'all know brad braham
[1:40:02] says the same way he used the first
[1:40:04] messenger
[1:40:08] you have to know the emphasis
[1:40:10] is the word
[1:40:12] the emphasis is not the man
[1:40:15] the emphasis is the word
[1:40:18] is the word that never changes
[1:40:25] praise the lord
[1:40:26] is the word
[1:40:28] that never
[1:40:29] change
[1:40:31] god
[1:40:32] can change the man
[1:40:36] are we together
[1:40:40] so that's the keystone revelation
[1:40:43] that god do not change
[1:40:46] praise the lord
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:49] he's the same yesterday
[1:40:51] today
[1:40:52] and forever
[1:40:57] you know while he
[1:40:58] he uh
[1:41:00] let us know
[1:41:01] you know that god takes his man but
[1:41:04] never takes his spirit
[1:41:07] because he's a spirit that worketh
[1:41:08] through the man
[1:41:11] praise the lord but every time god
[1:41:13] brings a man on the scene or dealing
[1:41:15] with a man
[1:41:17] he he uh he deals with that man
[1:41:20] in uh in uh
[1:41:22] in a special way by by the nature of the
[1:41:25] man or you know that you know when
[1:41:27] wherever he's bringing the man from
[1:41:30] praise the lord
[1:41:32] so i pray that uh
[1:41:35] uh you know the law will be able to help
[1:41:37] us we need to get right down into this
[1:41:40] you know into this subject about the
[1:41:42] depths of god
[1:41:44] and just like i said
[1:41:46] you uh
[1:41:48] uh
[1:41:49] let me let me let me take another
[1:41:52] another principle here so we can we can
[1:41:55] be able to see it has the same thought
[1:41:59] you know when when uh
[1:42:02] when the angel met
[1:42:03] jacob
[1:42:06] praise the lord
[1:42:10] the angel
[1:42:12] said to jacob
[1:42:14] there's genesis
[1:42:16] chapter 28 verse 7.
[1:42:20] and jacob said
[1:42:24] and he was afraid and he said how
[1:42:26] dreadful this place how dreadful is this
[1:42:29] place
[1:42:31] this is none other
[1:42:33] but the house of god
[1:42:36] and this is
[1:42:38] the gate
[1:42:40] of heaven
[1:42:44] praise the lord
[1:42:45] he says this is none other that's jacob
[1:42:48] confession when he got out of that dream
[1:42:50] and he saw angels ascending and
[1:42:52] descending he said this is none other
[1:42:56] that's why the place was called belter
[1:42:58] the house of god
[1:43:00] this is none other
[1:43:02] by the house of god and he said this is
[1:43:05] the gate
[1:43:06] of heaven
[1:43:08] so the principle i'm trying to bring out
[1:43:10] here is the other
[1:43:12] uh uh uh in matthew jesus said the gifts
[1:43:16] of hell
[1:43:18] shall not prevail
[1:43:21] but when he talks about
[1:43:23] heaven
[1:43:24] is just a gate
[1:43:29] jacob said this is the gate of heaven
[1:43:31] not the gifts of heaven
[1:43:34] just one gate
[1:43:38] amen
[1:43:39] but jesus said the gifts of hell
[1:43:43] many gifts of hell
[1:43:45] will not prevail
[1:43:48] against this one gate
[1:43:50] amen now so it's the same principle here
[1:43:54] when we talk about the depth of god
[1:43:57] and the depths of satan
[1:44:01] are you seeing the principle
[1:44:03] amen
[1:44:04] is
[1:44:05] i just want you to be able to grab it in
[1:44:07] your mind because you see the people
[1:44:10] talk about being deep in god
[1:44:14] you know they talk about being deep in
[1:44:16] god the the thing that is to have a hair
[1:44:21] blow there with a lot of thoughts
[1:44:24] you know a lot of thoughts and a lot of
[1:44:26] revelation and they are explaining you
[1:44:28] know the depths of god
[1:44:32] the depth of god is simple
[1:44:39] it's very simple
[1:44:42] can you can you imagine that brother
[1:44:44] branham is coming to preach their seals
[1:44:48] the mystery like jesus said mystery that
[1:44:51] has been hate from the foundation of the
[1:44:54] world
[1:44:57] and the first message he will preach
[1:44:59] is god
[1:45:00] in simplicity
[1:45:05] means that this is this is don't don't
[1:45:07] complicate it
[1:45:10] don't complicate it
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:13] praise the lord
[1:45:14] don't complicate it it's not
[1:45:16] i'm not coming to preach something to
[1:45:18] you that you have not heard
[1:45:20] don't be warming your engine
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:24] will force expectation
[1:45:25] [Laughter]
[1:45:29] praise the lord
[1:45:32] it's just a concept
[1:45:34] it's just to be able to understand a
[1:45:37] concept
[1:45:39] praise the lord like jesus said i am the
[1:45:42] way the truth and alive no one comes to
[1:45:45] the father but by me
[1:45:48] amen
[1:45:50] the gift of heaven jesus says i am the
[1:45:53] way
[1:45:54] it's just the same thing
[1:45:59] it is just how simple it is
[1:46:01] it's just the same thing paul talking
[1:46:04] about the depths
[1:46:06] and the land the breath and the height
[1:46:11] oh my goodness
[1:46:13] if you if you if you blew your mind with
[1:46:15] something yes i'm i'm sorry
[1:46:17] i don't have nothing under my sleeves
[1:46:22] i just bring to you the simplicity
[1:46:25] of jesus christ
[1:46:27] amen
[1:46:29] he's talking about
[1:46:31] the way that god deals with us
[1:46:34] that's why he said by one spirit we are
[1:46:37] all baptized
[1:46:42] into one body
[1:46:45] praise the lord brother branham will go
[1:46:47] ahead and and makes an example and said
[1:46:51] if this was the ocean
[1:46:54] and this was a teaspoon he says if i
[1:46:57] just take a little water in the teaspoon
[1:46:59] it has every chemical
[1:47:02] that this ocean has
[1:47:03] [Music]
[1:47:05] even though it's not the same amount but
[1:47:08] it has every chemical
[1:47:10] every material
[1:47:13] that this ocean has
[1:47:19] praise the
[1:47:20] lord amen
[1:47:23] that's that's how god deals with us
[1:47:38] oh praise the lord
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:50] now so
[1:47:51] uh
[1:47:52] as we look at this
[1:47:54] we want to go in in a way to be able to
[1:47:56] understand because of i believe if i if
[1:47:59] i can just establish this you grab the
[1:48:02] principle then it's it's easy to preach
[1:48:04] you know exactly where i'm going
[1:48:06] praise the lord
[1:48:07] is where is when we don't grab the
[1:48:09] picture then it looks like it's
[1:48:11] confusing it looks like we're trying to
[1:48:13] teach something that is above your head
[1:48:15] and trying to make things uh uh more
[1:48:18] spiritual and complicated no it's not
[1:48:20] supposed to be that way amen the bible
[1:48:23] says the common people heard him
[1:48:25] gladly
[1:48:27] amen when he heard his message there was
[1:48:30] such a comfort
[1:48:32] praise the lord
[1:48:38] now brother branham goes ahead he is
[1:48:40] still dealing with the ephesian church
[1:48:43] there is something
[1:48:45] about the efficient church
[1:48:47] amen
[1:48:49] just like
[1:48:51] the
[1:48:52] the you know uh
[1:48:54] the book of ephesians that is given to
[1:48:56] us
[1:48:57] uh uh
[1:48:59] is is it's a book that is called the
[1:49:01] high ground of the of the of the new
[1:49:03] testament
[1:49:04] because of some of the things that the
[1:49:06] apostle paul did with
[1:49:08] but brother branham said this
[1:49:10] brother branham said god
[1:49:12] commanded
[1:49:14] their
[1:49:15] efficient church
[1:49:17] for listening to what paul told them
[1:49:21] praise the lord
[1:49:23] if you go back to the book of acts
[1:49:26] you realize
[1:49:28] let's travel there a little bit
[1:49:31] let's go back to the book of arts
[1:49:38] praise the lord
[1:49:43] this was this was one of the last time
[1:49:46] that paul
[1:49:48] spoke
[1:49:49] to the to the efficient church
[1:50:08] what what the apostle paul did was the
[1:50:11] other
[1:50:12] he sent for
[1:50:13] the elders
[1:50:15] of uh
[1:50:17] of uh
[1:50:19] the church of of of ephesus because he
[1:50:22] didn't he never wanted to go over to the
[1:50:24] city
[1:50:26] he sent for them
[1:50:27] and then he met them on the
[1:50:30] you know on
[1:50:31] on a little island
[1:50:34] you know where where paul
[1:50:36] delivered
[1:50:37] the whole counsel of god
[1:50:40] praise the lord
[1:50:50] and that was the last time
[1:50:52] that he spoke to them
[1:51:03] praise the lord
[1:51:21] okay
[1:51:24] now now i mean uh
[1:51:26] uh
[1:51:27] i
[1:51:28] i just wanted to give you a picture
[1:51:30] of
[1:51:34] you know the the ephesian church age we
[1:51:36] know that
[1:51:37] it all started with these little
[1:51:38] disciples there over in uh uh that paul
[1:51:43] met
[1:51:44] uh
[1:51:45] there in ephesus and you know when you
[1:51:48] look at some of these things
[1:51:49] you just you just it just it just blows
[1:51:52] your mind because the the whole history
[1:51:55] of the church
[1:51:56] is right there just in few verses
[1:52:00] and sometimes
[1:52:01] you know it kind of spring over our eyes
[1:52:09] now so paul yet is talking to the church
[1:52:12] let's let me just read a little bit of
[1:52:14] that
[1:52:22] i think that's over here in
[1:52:27] chapter
[1:52:28] 23. kind of looking for the verse or
[1:52:31] chapter 24 let me let me just check my
[1:52:34] notes here
[1:52:56] uh
[1:53:03] praise the lord
[1:53:08] now brother branham says these disciples
[1:53:10] listening to what paul said
[1:53:13] and
[1:53:14] and god commanded them
[1:53:17] you know god commanded him
[1:53:19] actually it's chapter 20 i see what i'm
[1:53:22] get things
[1:53:23] wrote different here
[1:53:26] chapter 20.
[1:53:30] now paul speaks here a little bit the
[1:53:33] bible says
[1:53:34] uh over
[1:53:36] uh in
[1:53:40] verse 27 where he said for i'm not shown
[1:53:42] to declare unto you the whole council of
[1:53:45] god
[1:53:51] take he therefore unto yourself and onto
[1:53:53] the floods
[1:53:55] which the holy ghost make you overseer
[1:53:57] of
[1:53:58] now so what he did was he called the
[1:54:00] others of the church
[1:54:02] because he was there now to go back to
[1:54:05] ephesus so he called them to a little
[1:54:07] island and he starts to to say these
[1:54:10] things to them
[1:54:12] and uh and he talks to them in this way
[1:54:15] you know i'm not shown to declare the
[1:54:16] counsel of god take heed to yourself the
[1:54:18] flock that the holy ghost i make you
[1:54:20] overseer off to feed the church
[1:54:23] which uh he have purchased with his own
[1:54:26] blood for i know that after my departure
[1:54:30] shall grievous wolf enter in the morning
[1:54:33] now sparing the flock now so he's saying
[1:54:35] all of these things and you can read the
[1:54:37] rest of it the bible says in verse 30 it
[1:54:40] you know sorry most of all for the words
[1:54:43] that he spoke because he told them you
[1:54:45] will not see my face again that was the
[1:54:47] last time that he was with the ephesian
[1:54:49] church and the ephesian brethren now so
[1:54:52] you realize that
[1:54:54] when it comes over to the ephesian
[1:54:57] church age that's where the spirit of
[1:54:59] christ will command that church that
[1:55:02] those that call themselves jewels you
[1:55:04] know and that were not jews you were
[1:55:06] able to find them so which means in one
[1:55:09] sense the church was watchful the church
[1:55:12] knew that paul said there will be people
[1:55:14] that were creeping on the word there
[1:55:16] would be grievous warf you know so the
[1:55:18] holy ghost commanded them that they they
[1:55:20] kept what the messenger said to them
[1:55:25] praise the lord
[1:55:27] they kept what the messenger said
[1:55:30] now but there was there was something
[1:55:32] else also that was going on in the
[1:55:34] church
[1:55:35] you know because the ephesian church was
[1:55:39] taught in this way you know while the
[1:55:42] church that was taught about being
[1:55:43] predestinated i mean god paul never
[1:55:46] spoke to none of the other churches like
[1:55:48] the way he spoke to the ephesian church
[1:55:51] being choosing in the mind of god now
[1:55:53] you see how and that's some of the
[1:55:55] reason why complacent said has set among
[1:55:58] us oh we are the bride oh we're going in
[1:56:01] the rapture oh we we see the messenger
[1:56:04] of the hour we are in the message of the
[1:56:06] hour so you see what happened pretty
[1:56:08] soon that church starts to slack
[1:56:15] amen
[1:56:17] they lost their zeal
[1:56:20] they lost their fresh love
[1:56:22] what happened now they were only holding
[1:56:25] to teachings in their mind
[1:56:29] amen
[1:56:31] now so that there is a difference
[1:56:34] there is a difference between
[1:56:38] understanding something
[1:56:41] and making it your own
[1:56:44] there's a complete difference
[1:56:46] between understanding something
[1:56:49] and making it your own
[1:56:53] when something becomes your own you live
[1:56:56] by it
[1:57:00] praise the lord
[1:57:01] you don't argue about it you live by it
[1:57:04] it becomes your life
[1:57:12] are we together
[1:57:15] now so
[1:57:16] that's that's what we that's what we
[1:57:18] want to go in here so now let's let's
[1:57:20] move on and i wanted to do this so it
[1:57:22] would help take setting pressure from
[1:57:24] our mind the very name ephesus was a
[1:57:27] strange compound meaning aim and relax
[1:57:30] praise the lord
[1:57:34] the high aspiration of this age that
[1:57:37] have begun with the fullness of god with
[1:57:40] the kind of teaching
[1:57:42] the kind of a way that god dared with
[1:57:45] this ephesian church age
[1:57:48] praise the lord
[1:57:50] that paul could teach them
[1:57:54] the mysteries of god
[1:57:56] the great things of god
[1:58:01] the high aspiration of this age that
[1:58:03] have began with the fullness of god the
[1:58:06] depth of god
[1:58:10] that we are talking about the depth of
[1:58:12] god
[1:58:16] that came to the church
[1:58:18] the depth of god is god making you to
[1:58:21] know what your position is
[1:58:27] that's the depth of god
[1:58:29] because everything that god will be
[1:58:31] doing around your life
[1:58:34] is to bring you to that place
[1:58:41] the depth of god is what the word of god
[1:58:44] says about you
[1:58:47] you can study the word and and find out
[1:58:49] what the word says about what a pastor
[1:58:51] is supposed to be the qualification
[1:58:53] about a pastor the qualification about a
[1:58:55] deacon you can you can set it the word
[1:58:57] send it the message but if you cannot
[1:59:00] find what the world says about you
[1:59:04] then you are nowhere with god
[1:59:15] the depth of god is to be able
[1:59:20] to open god's word as you read the word
[1:59:23] and as you fellowship with the word and
[1:59:25] see the characters and different people
[1:59:27] that god used in the in time
[1:59:31] but yet you can relate
[1:59:33] that with yourself
[1:59:35] you can be able to see yourself in the
[1:59:37] picture
[1:59:40] that's the depth of god
[1:59:42] that is the height that god wants to
[1:59:44] bring you tall
[1:59:46] because it's an intimate relationship
[1:59:51] that's the depth of god
[2:00:02] so they had the depth of god whereby
[2:00:04] they were aiming
[2:00:07] for the high calling of god
[2:00:09] to know that
[2:00:11] they were choosing from the foundation
[2:00:13] of the world
[2:00:15] they were predestinated
[2:00:18] paul bringing those things to them
[2:00:21] that you might not know it now but
[2:00:22] that's what god did for the foundation
[2:00:24] of the world those things are lied in
[2:00:27] the parables of jesus christ
[2:00:31] he predestinated he called you to a holy
[2:00:34] calling
[2:00:35] oh even though you might be struggling
[2:00:37] with lost and struggling with different
[2:00:38] things but there is a holy calling that
[2:00:40] you are called home and you are bound to
[2:00:43] come to that calling
[2:00:44] there is no devil in hell that can stop
[2:00:46] you
[2:00:48] now you see the thing about it that
[2:00:50] understanding your position makes it
[2:00:53] easy
[2:00:55] it makes it easy
[2:00:58] for you to fight when it's time to fight
[2:01:00] it makes it easier for you to overlook
[2:01:03] when it's time to overlook
[2:01:11] now so you see the church was at this
[2:01:13] aspiration
[2:01:16] this depth of god they were aiming for
[2:01:18] the high calling begin
[2:01:20] to give way to less watchful attitude
[2:01:25] then it starts entertaining things in
[2:01:27] their life
[2:01:28] now the message now just became a hair
[2:01:30] knowledge
[2:01:32] praise the lord it just became a hair
[2:01:34] knowledge the prophet said the prophet
[2:01:36] said the prophet saying
[2:01:38] and it's they don't they're not even
[2:01:40] having a prayer life they're not even
[2:01:42] having a devotion with the word
[2:01:45] praise the lord
[2:01:49] as a paul was our messenger oh my
[2:01:51] goodness when paul preached you know i
[2:01:53] was there that day when he spoke on this
[2:01:55] i was there that day when you talk about
[2:01:58] family and husband and wife and all of
[2:02:00] that i mean all of those things were
[2:02:02] wonderful
[2:02:05] the world brought such
[2:02:07] an uplift to their spirit
[2:02:11] to give them a picture of themselves
[2:02:14] but pretty soon
[2:02:16] they got in
[2:02:18] a less watchful
[2:02:20] attitude
[2:02:24] amen
[2:02:25] a less ardent following of jesus christ
[2:02:28] begin to manifest itself
[2:02:38] praise the lord
[2:02:45] as an omen of the future the age of
[2:02:47] physical vehicle called the church
[2:02:50] will sink into
[2:02:52] an awfulness
[2:02:54] that is called
[2:02:56] the depths
[2:02:58] of satan
[2:03:02] amen
[2:03:05] praise the lord
[2:03:06] these people that were once on fire for
[2:03:09] god
[2:03:13] this has to relax
[2:03:17] amen
[2:03:19] it starts to lost the azim for god
[2:03:22] all they have now was just
[2:03:24] you know i was in that revival you know
[2:03:27] that that meeting long time ago you know
[2:03:29] they can point to all of those things
[2:03:32] but there is no present tense
[2:03:34] manifestation
[2:03:37] praise the lord
[2:03:39] and those days when when you see and and
[2:03:42] when i was taking on this that was the
[2:03:44] thing that was that was kind of for
[2:03:47] uh kind of a brilliant touch in my mind
[2:03:49] to preach on the bride revival because
[2:03:52] what people think the revival is is that
[2:03:55] we're going to have prayer line and
[2:03:57] people will come and and the gift of
[2:03:58] this sermon will be just like brother
[2:04:00] branham this is somebody sitting down in
[2:04:02] this congregation no the brown revival
[2:04:04] has always been coming back to the world
[2:04:17] he said that's what's going on right now
[2:04:21] god raising up ministry that is bringing
[2:04:23] the people back to the world
[2:04:28] praise the lord
[2:04:30] because the signs follow the word amen
[2:04:34] the manifestation follows the word
[2:04:43] it has become to relax
[2:04:46] and drifting
[2:04:48] already the age was
[2:04:50] backslide
[2:04:52] and had left his first love
[2:04:55] the tiny sea planted in that ephesian
[2:04:58] church age one day
[2:05:02] growth in the spirit of of arrow
[2:05:08] that little sea
[2:05:10] that started there in that church age
[2:05:14] praise the lord
[2:05:17] they are giving us the book of arts
[2:05:23] those people that were so burdened with
[2:05:25] god
[2:05:28] praise the lord
[2:05:31] until the word
[2:05:33] was major
[2:05:34] to them
[2:05:36] they start to relax and the age slowly
[2:05:39] starts to go into error
[2:05:41] they start to entertain things
[2:05:43] and do different things
[2:05:46] praise the lord
[2:05:54] the tiny sea plant in that ephesian
[2:05:57] church age
[2:05:59] will one day grow into the spirit of
[2:06:01] error until all
[2:06:03] foul births
[2:06:06] all the air
[2:06:08] will roast in his branches
[2:06:11] now think about this when joseph had a
[2:06:13] dream
[2:06:15] and uh of of uh or when those two men in
[2:06:19] the prison had their dream and brought
[2:06:21] it to joseph
[2:06:22] he realized that the man that was going
[2:06:25] to be hank was the one that the birds
[2:06:27] was eating out of his basket when jesus
[2:06:30] would talk about the parables you know
[2:06:34] of the sword of the seed he will also
[2:06:37] talk about the seed that falls and the
[2:06:39] birds came and hit it
[2:06:41] now so there is there is this scriptural
[2:06:43] principle word it has it has always been
[2:06:47] in a type of uh you know uh uh you know
[2:06:51] births and just like noah and i sent in
[2:06:54] the raven and the raven won't come back
[2:06:56] and and then by the dolph and all of
[2:06:58] that so you see there is that uh there
[2:07:01] is a there is a structural principle
[2:07:03] when we come uh uh uh down in talking
[2:07:05] about the depths of saturn we will get
[2:07:07] to that so i'm just throwing that out
[2:07:10] there
[2:07:11] and
[2:07:18] the ash growing the age grows into error
[2:07:20] until the fowls of the earth who rose in
[2:07:24] his branches so inoffensive
[2:07:28] to human reasoning you know all of these
[2:07:30] things were happening
[2:07:32] you know because now you have to also
[2:07:34] realize it was it was the the the same
[2:07:38] time two were the early church started
[2:07:40] getting under pressure
[2:07:43] you know i gave a a little bit of
[2:07:46] history there on wednesday night of of
[2:07:49] of why paul how to write the the
[2:07:52] testimonial red
[2:07:53] and and and you know and go over the
[2:07:56] sequence of the rapture for them is
[2:07:58] because the church was under pressure
[2:08:01] you know and the things that were
[2:08:02] happening make them to believe that they
[2:08:04] have missed the rapture
[2:08:07] so paul had to write them and tell them
[2:08:09] no
[2:08:12] you know the rapture will not happen
[2:08:14] until there will be a man of sin
[2:08:16] that will exalt himself and all of these
[2:08:18] things he starts to sleep so you see the
[2:08:21] church started moving into that
[2:08:23] direction and the people now were now
[2:08:26] finding ways to survive instead of
[2:08:29] depending on the god that has caught
[2:08:31] them
[2:08:33] so in one sense they started
[2:08:35] compromising they started laying down
[2:08:38] their standard just like the children of
[2:08:40] ezra did when they came over to the
[2:08:42] promised land
[2:08:44] they started making the tribes to pay
[2:08:47] tributes to them
[2:08:50] and keeping those people in the promised
[2:08:52] land
[2:08:56] so you see those things keep keep
[2:08:58] happening that i mean just like we look
[2:09:01] at the cycle last week
[2:09:07] think about when when when deliverance
[2:09:10] came to the church
[2:09:12] those few disciples that were that were
[2:09:15] hiding himself
[2:09:17] there and and they experienced the power
[2:09:19] of god the holy ghost came down they
[2:09:21] started speaking in tongues no more they
[2:09:23] could hide themselves to break the door
[2:09:25] open they went out into the streets
[2:09:29] testifying publicly preaching in three
[2:09:31] thousand souls coming to god
[2:09:35] walking right to the gate of beautiful
[2:09:37] and said saving god we haven't know what
[2:09:39] we have given today a man raised up they
[2:09:41] put into praising the whip then they
[2:09:43] came thanking god that they are now
[2:09:45] buried in their body the mark of jesus
[2:09:47] christ
[2:09:49] but as the age went by
[2:09:52] they started finding other ways
[2:09:57] praise the lord
[2:09:58] they started finding other ways
[2:10:01] to be able to solve their problems
[2:10:08] making leads with the people around
[2:10:12] and pretty soon so and then uh the
[2:10:14] assange started uh uh admiring out of
[2:10:16] the faith and daughters started marrying
[2:10:18] out of the faith and well in their sense
[2:10:20] is the way to save them
[2:10:24] and all of these things started
[2:10:25] happening and then the church started
[2:10:27] laying down his boundaries
[2:10:32] praise the lord
[2:10:34] amen
[2:10:36] but you see the thing there is that when
[2:10:38] the people thinks about the revival they
[2:10:41] send their mind back oh my goodness if
[2:10:43] we can just only have you know uh 120
[2:10:46] men let the holy ghost came down or if
[2:10:48] we can just only have at the house of
[2:10:50] kalinas
[2:10:53] where all we need to do is just come
[2:10:55] back to the world
[2:10:57] [Music]
[2:11:00] praise the lord let the world start
[2:11:02] taking preeminence in our lives let our
[2:11:04] words start taking preeminence in our
[2:11:06] home
[2:11:12] praise the lord
[2:11:17] and that innocent age
[2:11:19] that that experienced the move of god
[2:11:22] we pray the souls starts to see
[2:11:24] the depths of satan creeping and when
[2:11:27] brother branham talks about it
[2:11:29] you can read it and search it out he
[2:11:30] talks about how
[2:11:32] a keeming
[2:11:34] true
[2:11:35] and equality and doctrine
[2:11:38] praise the lord
[2:11:40] amen
[2:11:42] a beloved doctrine
[2:11:45] and a jesse bear spirit
[2:11:47] now those were the three elements of the
[2:11:49] depths of satan
[2:11:52] praise the lord
[2:11:54] amen
[2:11:55] when uh
[2:11:57] you know the the the church started
[2:11:59] choosing men of power and men of
[2:12:02] influence
[2:12:03] when it's supposed to be men that are
[2:12:05] filled with the holy ghost
[2:12:09] praise the lord
[2:12:10] amen and then pretty soon
[2:12:14] the church starts to go to the place of
[2:12:17] associating you have to know what was
[2:12:19] the spirit of bilaam was to bring the
[2:12:21] people down you know bring the israel
[2:12:24] down to akm you know for them to be able
[2:12:26] to dance with the mobile girls because
[2:12:29] they were setting traps if they can mess
[2:12:30] with the word
[2:12:34] then there is no way god can bless them
[2:12:38] praise the lord so let's set the feasts
[2:12:40] let's bring them down
[2:12:43] and that's why they did their set of
[2:12:45] feasts brought them down blasted the
[2:12:47] music all over
[2:12:49] and those people
[2:12:50] that were that were that you know that
[2:12:52] they had that you know
[2:12:54] uh the touch of god under the fear of
[2:12:56] god being led by the pillar of fire
[2:12:58] pretty soon you see their hair start
[2:13:00] shaking to the beach and they start
[2:13:02] tapping their feet to the beat and
[2:13:04] before you know they are dancing to
[2:13:06] those music dressing those ways they're
[2:13:08] all going crazy
[2:13:13] that it has to take a young fanny house
[2:13:16] to bring your heart to the whole thing
[2:13:19] in so much that moses all not the voice
[2:13:23] of the messenger
[2:13:26] all of the voice of the messenger moses
[2:13:29] was speaking
[2:13:33] and the people were saved continuing in
[2:13:35] the adulterous act
[2:13:39] he had to take a young phinehas
[2:13:43] praise the lord
[2:13:45] right in the midst of that
[2:13:48] he took a javelin
[2:13:50] and pierced them to the adulterous bed
[2:13:59] sometimes it takes an extreme measure
[2:14:03] in extreme situations
[2:14:05] [Music]
[2:14:08] and the bible says ahead back the wrath
[2:14:10] of god
[2:14:13] then the people start to come to
[2:14:14] conscience oh my goodness what are we
[2:14:16] doing
[2:14:20] praise the lord
[2:14:21] every time we leave the principle of the
[2:14:24] word
[2:14:25] you have left the depths of god
[2:14:30] every time we stay with the word god can
[2:14:32] take you to a height
[2:14:37] to go in
[2:14:38] go in height and go in the breath with
[2:14:40] god is just stay with his word
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:48] and just stay with the word
[2:14:50] no not explain the word now understand
[2:14:53] the word just fall in love with the word
[2:14:59] praise the
[2:15:03] lord amen
[2:15:12] now so you see all of these things
[2:15:14] happen
[2:15:15] happening around the church
[2:15:17] you know it happened around the church
[2:15:19] let me let me let me let's look at
[2:15:21] something also that paul there with in
[2:15:23] the book of romans
[2:15:28] see how the apostle paul did with this
[2:15:31] in the book of romans
[2:15:33] let's look at romans chapter 8.
[2:15:58] this familiar scripture romans chapter 8
[2:16:00] where paul speaks here verse 38 for i'm
[2:16:03] persuaded that neither death
[2:16:05] nor life not injured known principality
[2:16:08] no power nothing's present
[2:16:11] nothing's to come
[2:16:14] no height
[2:16:15] non-debt
[2:16:17] not any other creature
[2:16:20] shall be able to separate us
[2:16:24] praise the lord
[2:16:26] from the love of god
[2:16:28] which is in christ jesus
[2:16:31] now just hold to that
[2:16:33] romans chapter 11.
[2:16:57] verse 33 let's just look at that quickly
[2:16:59] i'm i'm completely out of my time here
[2:17:02] now verse 33 he says all the depth of
[2:17:05] the riches
[2:17:07] both of the wisdom and the knowledge of
[2:17:10] god how unsearchable
[2:17:13] are his judgment and his ways
[2:17:16] past finding out
[2:17:18] now it is this debt that paul was
[2:17:21] talking about
[2:17:23] god's ways that are past falling out
[2:17:26] it is almost like a universe like
[2:17:28] brother branham says you can create a
[2:17:29] word and go and live in it
[2:17:31] it's a way that god deals with uh with
[2:17:34] his children if the reaches of
[2:17:38] the knowledge and and the wisdom of god
[2:17:41] that unsearchable riches of god
[2:17:44] god's ways that are past finding out
[2:17:47] a man that is being plunged into the
[2:17:50] depth of god
[2:17:52] praise the lord
[2:17:53] now plunge into mysticism
[2:17:57] amen and creating things that do not
[2:17:59] exist things that would just bring
[2:18:01] complication to yourself
[2:18:03] it's just falling in love surrounding to
[2:18:05] god believing that he's the same
[2:18:07] yesterday today and forever
[2:18:10] taking god at his word
[2:18:13] want to wanting to experience the fire
[2:18:16] of god one more one more time on the
[2:18:18] altar of your heart
[2:18:22] i think that would give you the heaven
[2:18:24] desire
[2:18:26] praise the lord
[2:18:27] amen
[2:18:28] you don't have to see a church door to
[2:18:30] be a believer
[2:18:32] it's your life
[2:18:36] praise the lord you realize jesus was
[2:18:38] living his normal life
[2:18:40] he was never going to say i'm going to
[2:18:42] perform a miracle they call it a miracle
[2:18:45] but for him it was just his normal life
[2:18:47] the bible says why they said what manner
[2:18:50] of man is this
[2:18:52] praise the lord
[2:18:54] his manner was god's manner
[2:18:57] he was going about just living his
[2:18:59] normal life
[2:19:01] praise the lord
[2:19:03] going to preach a campaign he see a
[2:19:05] finer you know a procession guardian he
[2:19:07] says what's happening that woman crying
[2:19:09] for her son oh my goodness all my heart
[2:19:12] goes go to a mother crying for her son
[2:19:14] he stopped the whole preception and said
[2:19:16] boy rise up again mama take your boy go
[2:19:19] home
[2:19:21] [Music]
[2:19:22] it was just his normal life
[2:19:28] praise the lord
[2:19:31] he goes to a wedding right there the
[2:19:33] wine finishing and mary want to make a
[2:19:35] big shot of he says woman no don't do
[2:19:37] that
[2:19:40] praise the lord
[2:19:45] simple simple there was no emotion and
[2:19:49] you know calling crowd y'all take the
[2:19:52] gallon go and put water in it bring it
[2:19:54] back and save the
[2:20:00] people praise the lord
[2:20:07] or if god can just get
[2:20:09] a man or a woman in in in his hands
[2:20:13] brother branham says that's the thing
[2:20:15] that he longed for
[2:20:17] one that he will use
[2:20:19] and i will remain humble
[2:20:24] praise the lord
[2:20:26] one that god will use or god will stand
[2:20:28] to bless and and they will remain humble
[2:20:31] and it will stay still to the word of
[2:20:33] god and still dedicated to the things of
[2:20:35] god
[2:20:49] all that the riches
[2:20:51] of the wisdom
[2:20:53] and the knowledge
[2:20:57] they are unsearchable
[2:20:59] judgment of god
[2:21:03] praise the lord
[2:21:11] young people
[2:21:13] if we will realize how we are blessed
[2:21:17] all of this
[2:21:19] and a lot of it might not make sense to
[2:21:20] you
[2:21:22] praise the lord
[2:21:23] amen
[2:21:25] but just for you to be in an atmosphere
[2:21:28] where heaven looks down the pawn
[2:21:32] amen
[2:21:33] to be in number
[2:21:36] with god's people
[2:21:39] to be in a crowd where angels are come

[2:22:54] about the
[2:22:56] the
[2:22:56] the revival of the ocean
[2:23:00] he says when the ocean is having its
[2:23:02] revival is not adding more water to it
[2:23:05] when people think revival is to our mo
[2:23:08] church member
[2:23:09] he says no the ocean goes through his
[2:23:11] time where a porsche itself
[2:23:14] it gets rid of the trash
[2:23:16] it throw everything over to the shore
[2:23:19] it's just going back

[2:23:24] things
[2:23:25] praise the lord

[2:23:30] our heart
[2:23:32] amen
[2:23:34] because he's always
[2:23:36] to the place where we left him
