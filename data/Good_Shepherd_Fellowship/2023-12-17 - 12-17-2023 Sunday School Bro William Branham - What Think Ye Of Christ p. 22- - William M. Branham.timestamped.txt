[3:44] are we the sons of God not now is is now
[3:49] of present tense now are we the sons not
[3:52] we will be we are
[3:53] now we are this morning we are at this
[3:57] very hour now are we the sons of God's
[3:59] seated together set together in Heavenly
[4:02] places in Christ Jesus now right this
[4:06] very minute we're we're seated together
[4:08] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus every
[4:12] man by one Spirit we're all baptized
[4:14] into one body become members of this
[4:16] body by Holy Spirit baptism and now
[4:19] we're seated together in Heavenly places
[4:21] in Christ Jesus free from judgment we
[4:25] can never go to the Judgment how can you
[4:27] be judged twice by you
[4:30] God judged Jesus Christ and he put our
[4:34] judgment up on Christ and Christ paid
[4:36] our Judgment at
[4:38] calary if we're in Christ we're secured
[4:40] in Christ by how do we get into Christ
[4:44] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[4:46] one body is that right we're into that
[4:49] body of Jesus Christ and while we're in
[4:52] there we've accepted his punishment in
[4:56] our stead he knowing no sin yet was made
[4:59] sin for us and then he bore our sickness
[5:03] he bore our sins and we come into him we
[5:06] are free from these judgments God cannot
[5:10] justly judge me or you the second time
[5:12] if he's already accepted us in Christ
[5:14] Jesus and punished his own son for us
[5:16] how can he punish us then when he's
[5:18] already had Christ has paid our price if
[5:21] I go down to the pawn shop and and I've
[5:23] got something that's just like the human
[5:25] life the devil put us in a pawn shop
[5:28] that's right devil put us in a pawn shop
[5:31] because of transgression but if you got
[5:33] something Pond and you go down with the
[5:36] and get that out of pond and get a
[5:39] receipt bark you have a right to take it
[5:41] out now there's no need of trying to go
[5:43] down if I had my watch in pond and you
[5:45] went out and tuck it out for me there's
[5:46] no need to be going try to pay it again
[5:48] I can't pay it again because it's
[5:50] already
[5:51] paid oh when I think of that something
[5:55] on the inside of me on this fif rib on
[5:57] the left side leaps higher than the disg
[6:00] because I know the devil had me in the
[6:02] pawn shop one time because of sin and
[6:04] transgression but Jesus Christ took me
[6:06] out of the pawn shop and redeem me back
[6:08] to God that makes me his son this
[6:10] morning and it is not yet yet appear
[6:13] what I shall be in the final end but I
[6:15] know I'll have a body like his own
[6:16] glorious body for I shall see him as he
[6:19] is free from sickness free from sin well
[6:21] sure he was a Son of
[6:24] God it's been the Aged old question man
[6:27] seeking hungering after God if I should
[6:30] call this morning and find out a few of
[6:32] his friends of course now we'll take his
[6:34] enemies for a minute let's ask somebody
[6:36] by scriptural Authority we could go on
[6:39] and on and on but let's just add get
[6:41] some scriptural Authority for who Jesus
[6:43] Christ was what think you of him if I of
[6:46] course his friends you say brother
[6:47] Brandon will testify of him let's ask
[6:49] his enemies about him man let's see what
[6:51] the enemy says the Devil Himself know
[6:53] that was a Son of
[6:55] God why the preachers back there they
[6:57] didn't know he was a Son of God he said
[6:59] he's a the chief mind reader he's be
[7:01] elub the chief of the Devils but the
[7:03] devil said we know who you are the Holy
[7:06] One Of God why cometh th to torment us
[7:09] before our time comes there the devil
[7:11] said he was a Son of God is that right
[7:15] look at the vest dirtiest enemy he ever
[7:17] had was Judas iscar when Judas iscar
[7:20] realized what he had done and he seen
[7:22] that Ma Son of God hanging on her
[7:24] between the heavens and earth suffering
[7:26] bleeding his body he took that silver he
[7:28] had bought 30 pieces of silver and throw
[7:30] it before the high priest and said I
[7:32] betrayed innocent blood that's right is
[7:36] lowest enemy testified that he was a Son
[7:39] of God when he died the heavens and
[7:42] earth turned black smudy black God
[7:45] testifying of it the Roman centrion put
[7:47] his hand over his heart that pierced his
[7:49] side and said truly that was the son of
[7:52] God is that right let's look at old
[7:56] pilot standing there all out of humor
[7:58] got up early in the morning called to
[7:59] the Judgment seat and stuck a reef
[8:01] around his head and sitting on there
[8:02] waking up after a big party the night
[8:04] before perhaps and sitting there and oh
[8:07] fussed up with them Jews anyhow and he
[8:09] is condemning him and everything else I
[8:11] hear a horse coming down the street at a
[8:12] Gallop what is it it's a it's a palace
[8:16] page coming in and he runs down before
[8:19] the the emperor and falls down before
[8:21] him and presents a a note to him from
[8:23] his wife let's look at Pilot standing
[8:26] there and he all tore up this tee set he
[8:28] begins to read this note his hands begin
[8:30] to tremble his knees begin to knock
[8:32] together he turns pale white let's look
[8:34] over his shoulder and see what he's
[8:35] reading have nothing to do with this
[8:38] just man for I've suffered many things
[8:40] today in a dream because of him a pagan
[8:44] wife riding an oath to her Pagan husband
[8:47] don't have nothing to do with this man
[8:49] for today I've suffered many things in a
[8:51] dream pilot said Bring Me Some Water I
[8:53] find no fault in him at all what is it
[8:57] his enemies testifying
[8:59] that's right God makes everything quiver
[9:02] shake at that name Jesus Christ brother
[9:06] that's where the church today has lost
[9:08] the the sality of that name the power of
[9:10] that name when Moses went out into Egypt
[9:13] if those people he had a staff he packed
[9:15] before him how ridiculous see that old
[9:18] man out there real old 80 years old
[9:21] white beard way down like this and white
[9:23] hair hanging down his back and here he
[9:25] goes with his wife setting a straddle of
[9:27] a mule and a and a child on each hip
[9:30] here goes Moses just praising God
[9:32] walking down like that the people say
[9:34] where are you going Moses I'm going down
[9:35] to Egypt to take over could you imagine
[9:39] nonsense an old man 80 years old with a
[9:42] wife and two children and a donkey and a
[9:44] stick in front of him going down to take
[9:45] over the greatest mechanized unit in the
[9:48] world there was no why Egypt had
[9:50] conquered the world but he said how you
[9:53] know you're going to take over God said
[9:55] so and I believe it that's right that's
[9:58] right God said so and he did it amen for
[10:02] he took God at his word when God said
[10:05] what he did about Christ I believe it's
[10:07] a truth but if those Egyptians could
[10:09] have ever got that stick out of moses'
[10:11] hand they' had him whipped that wasn't
[10:13] God that wasn't Moses stick that was
[10:15] God's judgment rod that's what hit the
[10:17] rock that's what he stretched out and if
[10:19] they could ever took that stick away
[10:21] from him they' have had it whipped but
[10:23] he guarded that stick with his life and
[10:25] today if the people would only regard
[10:27] the name of Jesus was left in the church
[10:30] he said whatever you ask the father in
[10:32] my name that will I do I he gave the
[10:36] church his name to to marry bury baptize
[10:39] everything in the world that we do
[10:40] whatever you do in word and deed do it
[10:42] all in the name of Jesus Christ but we
[10:44] lost the sacredness that name we use it
[10:46] in Bain and jokes and there you can't
[10:49] put bitter and sweet water out of the
[10:50] same Fountain friend you got to get to a
[10:52] place to you reverence that name and
[10:54] believe it and know it and use it just
[10:56] exactly right now if I was called this
[10:59] morning a witness of some of his friends
[11:01] what if I call Noah today and say Noah
[11:05] come down out of the heavens and come
[11:06] here just a minute I want you to testify
[11:08] to this audience this morning what think
[11:10] ye of Christ whose son was he why Noah
[11:13] would say it's the son of him who called
[11:15] me that day out in the field and said
[11:16] build an ark for the saving of your
[11:18] household Noah would recognize quickly
[11:21] that was him what if I could call Isaiah
[11:24] the prophet today I'd say Isaiah come

[13:08] as the Holy Spirit was up on me and I

[13:13] rolled into Babylon and crushed down the
[13:15] kingdom of the world yes sir I can hear
[13:18] him said and another thing one day for
[13:20] my testimony they throve me into a d of
[13:23] lions while I was standing there and the
[13:25] first thing I seen Lions I heard your
[13:27] soft paded hoofs to or their feet coming
[13:30] rather pausing I could feel their breath
[13:32] almost on me I know it was in that dark
[13:34] dungeon a few minutes to be tore
[13:36] together and all of a sudden something
[13:39] moved every fiber in my body I felt

[13:58] who is is the Son of God standing there

[14:33] broke anybody that wouldn't to serve
[14:36] their gods and idols and so forth and be
[14:38] popular with the rest of the bunch would
[14:40] be thrown into a fiery furnace but we
[14:42] purposed in our heart in a prayer
[14:43] meeting one night that we would not
[14:45] defile ourselves of them God we go to

[15:10] than it ever was H and we had to walk
[15:12] into the fiery furnace but we know that
[15:15] something inside of us that moved us and
[15:18] a spirit that testified to us that we
[15:20] were God's children that God was able to
[15:22] Deliver Us from the fiery furnace but
[15:24] nevertheless would never bow down to
[15:25] their image then on that great morning
[15:28] when we going to walk with her hands

[16:26] great garments hanging around him

[16:31] and he said he come like the Ancient of
[16:33] Days whose hair was white as wool while

[16:38] see an angel went up to him by the name
[16:39] of Gabriel with his sword pulled and
[16:41] said Master have you looked down in
[16:43] Babylon this morning why they're about
