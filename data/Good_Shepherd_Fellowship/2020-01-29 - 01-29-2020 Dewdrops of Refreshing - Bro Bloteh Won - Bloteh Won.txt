the emergency tonight we want to place her into your hands we know you are the Great Physician Lord and we thank you for the many ways that you are touching our lives this we ask tonight in Jesus name Amen amen first Kings chapter 17 on Sunday we started the life of Elijah the importance of the ministry of Elijah I just take for skin chapter 17 first Kings chapter 17 praise the Lord first Kings chapter 17 we read from verse 1 again and Elijah the Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gatling said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel even before whom I stand there shall not be deal not rain this years but I call him to my word and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hence and turn thee is wall and hide ourselves by the Brooks chariot that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shall drink of the broth and I will commend the Raven to feel be there amen let's pray father we just want to ask your blessings tonight again we love you and we appreciate you Father Lord come and take us Lord Jesus the young law father glad I will touch tonight we want to actually for inspiration we also want to ask you for the ability to hear from you tonight in Jesus name we pray amen Allah bless you may have your sips and it will be in the house of the Lord and I praise the Lord amen praise the Lord start talking about the importance of the larger ministry and there were a few things I said Winston Amy's on Sunday morning I want to go over there just so we can be right in line with the scripture a little bit in and one of those things was you know just like when we read the scripture just now and I was looking at there today and I thought about it as is so you know here is Elijah the prophet year with with this great advance from now and Israel in seeing the way a happened Jesse bear I mean is they are taking the people on a dia grape and he bring the message to a hub and the scripture says and then the law told him to go and hide himself get away and go by the Brooks sheriff and and he would drink of the Brooks and God is going to feed him with raving a commander raving to feed him and I was just thinking about it because if you look in a book of you look in the Book of Leviticus the ravings were one of their own clean verse so that's a kind of a paradox that take place under the Elijah Ministry and the Lord used Raven year one of the thing that is major on a larger ministry is the other it comes and it declared judgment and mercy it brings judgment and mercy to the people and honor judgment it brings a fami no rain no deal that's funny Elijah ministry Brody on Elijah ministry that was also a family honor Elijah ministry God is using Ravens unclean birds to feed the Prophet on Elijah ministry God is going to use lepers unclean humans to also feed the people because it's the lepers that went into the city and call the people to a revival praise the Lord so there's a paradox here on the John the Baptist there was also a family because for hundred years the people never had a prophet so there was a spiritual famine that was that was that was also on the land and then year God also will be using people like Matthew and and all these disciples that were not laying to the Levitical priests who to be disciples of of the master so there is there is a paradox that is taking place under the elijah ministry that we have to look at very closely as we go along praise the Lord but I want to go back to the three and a half years quickly before they're slipping because sometimes you I mean you see some things and you reflect on it and then you you try to go back to the scripture to make sure that you are saying what you are saying right Elijah said here in verse one first king he came on to a hub as the Lord God of Israel ever before whom I stand there shall not be do all rain this years now he did not put how many years to me right here he said this years amen now we will fight we were realize that it was our Lord Jesus the actually put time to it see Luke chapter 4 let's go quickly to us in Luke chapter 4 see Luke chapter 4 verse 25 see Luke chapter 4 verse 25 I gotta make sure that I mean look and then I go look should I mean strong it falling it look make sure that I'm in verse 25 is that reading something different verse 24 and Jesus said verily I say unto you lo prophetess is accepted in his own country but I tell you of a truth many widows were in Israel in the day of Elias when the heavens were shot for three years and six months when great famine was true out all the lame amen our Lord Jesus bought time to it three years in six months he brought their out they Apostle James I can say like their that he opposed to James because he sat down under the Lord Jesus so he took it from Jesus and in James chapter 5 verse 7 he also put time to it amen but there is something that is over also in in chapter 18 of first King there is something that is in chapter 18 of first King let's go back there praise the Lord in first Kings chapter 18 verse 1 and it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year saying go show thyself on to a hub and I will send rain upon the earth amen so here the scripture is establishing that Elijah came in the Tyrian and there should be at the end of the tail year because it was three and a half years so he came at the end of the tail year to now remove the curse from on the land praise the Lord now you will see the reason why I said this six months can only rightly be fed into the time Elijah met God before he came to speak to a hub because he ever said year in in the in the 18th chapter he's coming in the tail year to remove the curse then what are we going to do with the six months because Jesus said it was three years and six months do you see what I'm going with this praise the Lord because the Word of God cannot be broken scripture can contradict itself and we can only be grateful that God has given us a prophet to help us rightly place these words amen so that is that is one of the things that I will want for us too for us to first establish before we go over as we want to travel year because I remember I said that on on Sunday morning and I just went farther with faith and never came back to death so as we see here Elijah brings the world we look at the Kings and and and when I went home I was also also steadying on the kings of Judah we will look at there too because there were there were cases that were right in between the kings of Israel and Judah and we will find time to look into the schemes as well but we will see here there he pronounced this word and he said to the a hawk there will be no rain or Dew you know do or rain now we have to understand there you go in a book of of joy Jared is talking about what the locusts have eaten the Palmer won't the kinda wound the caterpillar jaw is dealing with Israel I call him to the the ax farming seizing praise the law we have to realize that the Israel the land that is given to them that where they are now is a dessaline the Prophet did prophesied that the desert was going to blossom and his blue so many men because God said it and God had to back up his world praise the Lord but it's a desert lane and because of that Israel how this what we hear as the the the the letter rain and the former rain is is more the Prophet brought it to us more in a spiritual application but for Israel a farming season they had the the earlier ring that came and then the letter rain also now if we ever go without one of this rain they were there they were also blessed with the deal I mean they were also blessed with the deal so for Elijah to come on the scene and and and said there will be no rain there will be no deal or that you have to know how serious this situation was praise the Lord now the reason why are all so that we can we can take the the spiritual application of the former rain and the latter rain we read a scripture on Sunday also in in the tournament chapter Terry to where God said my mind you know my word would go out like the rain you know and my speech would be on to you like the deal praise the Lord so if you take that that also we help us to understand why joy the prophet in the prophets all through the scripture how to they can they can look at Israel situation they can look at the the unnatural situation and be able to tell how the spiritual situation is going to be let me bring it to you this way Pharaoh had a dream I mean and in his dream that he had he saw lain counts and he saw fat cows praise the Lord and then he comes now and call his wise man no matter who found the answer to it praise the Lord now when Joseph was caught on the scene and the law would give Joe say the interpretation of that dream praise the Lord I mean he sought link house and he saw fat cows but when God would give Joseph the interpretation of the dream it could just rightly fade because Israel that was the word that God did with them praise the Lord also and you will realize that I'm trying to see if I can be able to nail this down for you in a way there are when David none of the people I'm trying to to catch you into this when David num other people and the law came to David that night and told him the evil that he have done there were three things that was placed before David one of them was pestilence amen another one was famine and the Terr one was swor now if you go and you read Jeremiah and you read all of those prophets you will see that was those were the the three signs of judgment now Davis said ah Lord you deal with me don't put me in the hands of the enemy wish of course I don't want saw I don't want war sois will always represent war it was always saw pestilence or farming how are we together I'm trying to get a scripture here quickly that I can be able to - sorry Lynn if my mind you know where we have gone this way praise the Lord that's the reason why you know you don't need a pray and ask the Lord to take you beyond your notes so when he start taking you beyond your nose thing you don't have nothing to say amen praise the Lord I'm trying to find good Ezekiel chapter 7 verse 15 let's look at this this one verse would be able to put our our our thing into context here Ezekiel chapter 7 verse 14 7 I mean 15 the swore is without the pestilence and the farming within he that is in the field shall die with the swarm he dead is in the city famine and pestilence shall devote him now so this word the three types of judgment three signs of judgment so it was either s war with me war or it was farming which means no food or pestilence sickness if you look right down I mean all the way down from Abraham whenever God who deal with his people it will always be one of these three praise the Lord Amen so you will see that the the rain and ado had very serious significance to Israel are we together until when when when when Joseph or when Jacob was blessing his sons you realize that the deal was was was always port the autonomy chapter 33 verse 13 and Joseph said blessed be the Lord blessed of the Lord be his lane for the precious things of heaven for the deal and for the depth their cash beneath and Genesis 27 38 so what what I'm trying to bring here is that do you had a great significance in so much that God who compared the deal with the speeches that comes from his mouth I mean he says the rain would be like my doctrine and the deal will be like the speeches that comes from a mouth so Elijah the prophet coming on the same and telling the people that would be there will be nor do you and no rain until I cover it up I get some scriptures laying out here joint chapter 2 verse 23 Jeremiah 3 verse 3 chapter 5 verse 24 you will see how all of those things played in the deal and rain they were very significant to Israel until when Jacob blessed his son he that was Isaac that was Isaac that blessing came from Isaac that's in genesis chapter 27 and Isaac his father answered and said unto him behold that that dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and the dew of heaven from above so deal was a sense of blessing amen if it did not have the rain Lord don't take the deal amen if we don't have no rain Lord please don't take the deal because if there is no rain if there is no deal then it's death in the lane and that is the same thing in the church if there is no rain and if there is no deal is spiritual drought death in the pot like Elijah was saying so these things were very significant and that is the reason why a large your heart to come on the scene so you as who as we following the important of the Elijah ministry we have to see how is going to play out in the other it's going to play out the same way in Elijah is going to play out the same where in John the Baptist is you play out the same way in a larger promise on a Malachi form and even the same way honor the Elijah of Revelation chapter 11 pray so long because if we can if the Lord can be able to help us to see and understand the importance of the Elijah ministry we will know the time that we are living in and we will be grateful for the ministry that God has given to us praise the Lord yea the Lord takes him also down straining up three years there will be no rain no deal and God is taking him by a Brooks not even by a river praise the Lord God takes him by a little bro and God command the reading he didn't send offs he didn't say me go he sent the ribbing to feel his profit are we together guarding himself he's a law by himself praise the Lord and that's the reason why I was a last Wednesday we were speaking a little bit on the types in the shadow because Jesus said the scripture cannot be broken amen and the times and the shadow also cannot be broken because they are all part of the scripture that's what God used to be able to play out his word for us to better understand what his grace is doing praise the Lord amen while I was driving coming to you just about honor the light I was thinking about a code and I go in the office I did really did not find the time to be I mean to be able to bring it out but brother Branham said this and any applies to this Elisha bring the word there will be no deal there will be no rain until I call for it and then God tells him and says get the hints get out of the way God takes the light of Israel away he takes the Prophet away remember never BAM says Elisha was Jezebel pastor so in another sense because of the rebellion of the people because the people would not follow the Word of God what God would do he would take the garlic man of the scene and that's the reason why I was thinking about that scripture - not that co2 not because brother Branham say it applies to the church in as much as it applies to the home praise Lord amen verbatim says if if there is a church there is that is praying for the revival and I mean the people one a desire in the heart to get closer to God I've seen these things happening before and I mean the people are testing for God if the man that God placed there if he would not stand by the word if he would not seek the face of God and get under the burdens of these people God would take him off the scene amen and it's also in the reverse because exactly what was happening here Israel has gone away from the world Why should there be a prophet that would come and tell them does say the law when they were all going over to the to the temple of bill God will have to take his candlestick away praise the Lord brother Branham says if God give us a garlic a godly father or a Garland husband that was staying for the word and want to rule his family by the word he says if the home when our line of God would take the man away strip Jura principle the same thing wafer wafer with a godly pastor to a rebellious Church and you look on the efficient Church age he used that when he says I come and take your candlestick praise the Lord I bring out the coat and I'll read it to you directly so you see here so that that is exactly what was happening years Israel has gone away from the Lord so and God knows how to deal with these things he knows how to take care of these things all we have to do is to love the Lord praise the Lord amen if a man is not lining up with the word just love the Lord God knows how to deal with that if it is God's man he knows how to bring him on his knees he knows how to straighten him up but if we try to take a political round and see less riot and less you know let's rebelled because he's rebelling that is not God's principle are we together so that just drop of my mind while I was driving to church tonight I didn't have the time to really bring out the coat to you but I said so I will find it for you now so we see here that God took him right down there also told this Brooks it kind of awestruck my mind as well it's Josh Minh three years then God would take him down to a broke that would drive in six months no but there was also a widow that would take care of the Prophet praise the Lord Amen but you know sometimes that's the way God does praise the Lord look at his type what Bram says when when he went down that to the widow he says this must seems cruel for him to tell the widow fits mean a cake first after she have told him that this was the last one amen that this was the last one but in a way she obeyed the voice of the Prophet she went to make the cake and give it to the prophet and he larger prophesied that the bank is not going to to dry up the oil without finish and and God's Osteen at her now brother branham said it happened this way that it was not like Elijah said it and I mean her whole band just fell with with food all over but they were just enough every time she went to that day praise the Lord and that is the same way we're taking the Prophet down to a Brooks because if it's a big body of water and a river it shows a great revival praise the Lord and that's how the human mind is sometimes you find you know everybody talks about a revival that is happening in and I came soaring and then pretty soon everybody want to go and run to that revival but you have to realize that there were people down that I prayed and still of the revival and sometimes when we get there then we made them the water muddy praise the Lord sometimes God just wanted to have you down to a little country church where there was no piano there is no data there is no instrument just a little country church that is enough for you to get the Word of God every time sometimes that's what it takes to be able to more you praise the Lord I know that's what it takes to be able to mold me I mean sometimes he just he just want to put you to that place that would just have you trust him every time because when he said when when it's abroad and and it's going to dry up you have to be expecting a miracle to get water from there tomorrow when it's a river there is no expectation for miracle his river is running and that was the same thing he did down in the widow house where Branham says it was not just like the bag just grew and it was fallen off it was the same bag but the prophecy it will never go dry she had enough every time she went back to that empty side praise the Lord are we together and that's the way the Lord want us he want us to trust him that's what I said if it is not rain Lord don't take the deal praise the Lord amen I'll tell you a funny story I used to like the deal that time of the year we used to walk to school and then one particular reason why I used to like the deal just before I get to school I kick the bushes my shoes get wet I just wept it is shining I always used that to clean my shoes what is such a refreshing feeling to get honor the early morning you praise the Lord some what I experiences I could tell you but let's go ahead to night him in almost losing my time tonight praise the Lord so we see these things you know God breaking Sartre I mean such a great ministry on the scene challenging what is happening in that day the politics of the day I mean the bow worship and everything that is going on he's challenging it and remember a larger till now until he meet God in the mountain he's believing I'm alone I and I alone he don't know nothing about all of these believers that are scattered all over the world and crying to go for for rupturing failing and praying to God for the revival and I mean it they won the wars that they are really in the profit message to become real in their life he don't know about them you wanna know about himself he says I and I alone praise the Lord he's out there challenging a hub glory be to God and go out o him get to the Browse get off the scene you have spoken my word just get off the scene praise the Lord and Elijah goes off the scene he goes down there and we see he visited the widow's house after the Brooks driving and God told him to move foul he didn't even know were words the next place is going to survive from and you just think about it even larger if he's if he's applying this just like we read Deuteronomy chapter 11 if he is looking into Moses writing and talking about shutting up the heavens and that there'll be no deal and then here said that God is sending a raven to feed him when the very same prophet Moses say no those are unclean animals you think about it you think about it now just at the very time when God is about to break the revive or the blessing of Pentecost to the Gentiles God spread a table before Peter in a vision and say eat is it no law no III being taught all of these things are unclean things he says all of these things I don't clean things I've never eaten a none of them he goes back to sleep the vision comes back upon his head God tells him eat I were together just at the junction and what was happening here was the I mean the disposition was about to turn around the blessing of Abraham was about to pour upon these these strangers people that have been strangers they were only use they were brought in a little bit here a little bit there one came in called a rehab because a Hebrew general choose to marry her another one came in called a roof but this was the time word the fullness of the blessing was about to turn over to these people and God is using their vision to be able to convince this preacher praise the Lord Amen now you can just see sometimes why God have to use different ways to speak to us because he knew how we are made he know how stubborn we are the evening that we read it in the scripture we will say Amen to it but there would just be something behind it that we now want to let it go so he gotta use some kind of a different way to be able to bring us back to that scripture and said this is the thing I want you to obey because I'm telling you there is no way that Peter was ready if God who has spoken to him directly and said Peter go to the house of Colinas even the name Colinas would stumble him praise the Lord what was the one that pray for Paul and I mass go how to speak to him in a dream because the name of Paul was a terror praise the Lord so God put all of these this medium in the body he put he put gifts in the body he put different that a different way he designed us to be able to speak to Albert Branham called the channel of communication your China of communication might not be mine praise the Lord the danger there is that every channel that God will speak to you and deal with your heart must come in subjection to the word of God praise the Lord oh yeah sometimes you find people they are so gifted I mean they can dream told the description of colors and shape and everything I mean so perfect and well you have to realize that gift and calling without repentance so this channel that God have to deal with you was giving to you from birth it was given to you from birth you never got it when you got saved I mean when he designed you and put everything there that that is needed for your body together he had a particular China India that is the reason why even in your natural life you look at things different they are things that that speaks to you there - speak to me praise the Lord some people just natural things the looks odd and they see God in it so quickly and it can even see that there is nothing like Trinity Trinity is giving him difficult for them to see it but it can look a natural thing and you see God in it so quickly and we can see God in the scripture praise the Lord Amen so you think about it Elijah if he was really in the message of Moses he was reading the message he was feeding the message and God is telling him send a raven to feed him praise the Lord I believe there was some conflicts might have gone in his mind Maxie said Lord I'm not really in your will are you the one speaking to me I thought you said in your word that these were unclean animals praise the Lord but you see by every junction of time and every junction of time when God is about to turn dispensation over when he's about to turn Nations over he come around in a very light of his word and sometimes things were happy and it looks like it's contrary to God's Word Peter I'd you know law I'm not going to do it he goes to sleep he dream about the same thing he said no Lord I'm not going to do it I mean he fight himself out of his sleep he wake of it oh yeah thank God my goodness me he had just received the Holy Ghost he just came from in the upper room and he's struggling on a portion of the word god it's a god is interpreting that word God is about to make that word flesh in him because you see it's so easy for us to believe the word when it's on the book but for this word to take flesh in us many times that's where the struggle is because I mean we are so attached to our nature we are so attached to the special where we are made in a special way we can do things when the word is about to take flesh that is the reason why it had to be better in Jaws stomach sweet in his mouth when he's reading it when when they get down and start to materialize through his body and you see sometimes when we get to our weak points and we get to our failure it's not a failure to God to God he's breaking you apart so the word can be materialized in your body praise the Lord and sometimes it's it's so hard look at John he was the one that said behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the word amen he said it right there on River Jordan all of these disciples we're around him and now he's telling one of those men go and ask him is he really the Messiah praise the Lord well it's so easy for you to stand right there I said oh I don't know what's happening to this god I can't believe in man when he said at first it was so inspiring but now he it looks like he's changing his salmon it was the change of dispensation every time when dispensation is about to change when there is a major even that is about to happen this day the scripture is fulfilled better Blenheim did not plan it but he was willing to talk on birth pains and because birth pains was all about judgment and birth pains is fulfilling the second part of isaiah sister 1 gonna make a profit couldn't even find his scripture praise the Lord so sometimes when things are not just happening right don't think that God is lost god don't get lost in your confusion no he don't get lost in your confusion he's right there he's looking at you he know that you are confused but he's not confused because he know exactly what is happening praise the Lord Elijah I'm sending Raven to feel you Elijah norm there is no rain there is no dude there is no food for the matter of fact it has already deployed a man to arrest him and lock him up so he know he can go to the supermarket so now he has to eat from this unclean bird oh my goodness he's battling in his mind but yet he's obeying God's Word because you know God has spoken to him Peter come out of that dream those men came to his house not the door he's going to this Gentiles he's going with them all in his mind he's thinking in his mind these people urgent idea unclean they are not in the economy of God but he's following them yet because there was an anointing that is controlling him praise the Lord sometimes our body like the scripture says sons of God are led by the Spirit of God but you see when the Spirit of God comes on a believer it just does not take over your reasoning the Spirit of God don't make you stupid you got to keep your common sense keep your common sense praise the Lord amen it comes to anoint you to lead you in the path of God's Word you don't take out your senses you don't take out your emotion praise the Lord Amen because we hear people make those kind of I mean selling excuse I was late but I didn't know what happened you just left your senses back praise the Lord so he's going under the leadership of the Holy Spirit but he's having battle in his mind I don't know if you have ever been there before you know that everything you are doing is that calling to the Word of God but yet it's still not making sense to you you know why because God is working on the sixth sense and you are just on five because when fate comes down when that anointing comes down is the channel of the sixth sense and if you don't come up higher you will be all of that anointing and here you stinking fuse and he gets to the house he don't see no rabbi there he don't see no no no no Jewish Jews there he seems so so Gentiles oh my goodness okay he's so nervous it's good to be here praise the Lord because you don't know where to start from what I should say God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob all and we just can write it so levels if this is the way I'm going to go I come in my soul body and spirit in the hills maybe these people would just praise the Lord but the scripture says as he began to speak the Holy Spirit fear and the very same atmosphere that was in the upper room was created there Imperius Wow God is no respecter of persons praise the Lord so it's now we that control the word is the word that control it details our actions praise the Lord the Bible says as he begin well what was he's talking about he was talking about his vision that's all he was talking about he did not had a message he didn't know what to say to these Gentiles because he's all trouble in his mind well so you see when sometimes when God is about to bring his word to pass to fulfill his word he take an act situation praise the Lord in God or being the word for you in a manner of this believer just saying they born will be struggling energy they're going to do you know whatever they're going to do God is going to meet you right in that situation and when grace comes on the scene you will be so embarrassed of yourself praise the Lord you will be so embarrassed of yourself because one thing we have to know when he predestinated us it was now when we first start coming to church it was a work that was done from the foundation of the world when he wrote our names on a live walk of life it was a work that was done before the foundation of the world that's the reason why we can limit gone to time we can limit God to the situation around our life we have to see that God is bigger and greater then no matter what we are going through and we also have to believe that he have everything under control praise the Lord even though it looks like a chaos but God have it under control if we can just trust him praise the Lord if we can just trust him you remember the last time we talked about trust and better banham talks about that lady I say I trusted the Lord until the last card but then I said no you were holding on to something you should have trusted him when there was nothing to hold on to praise the Lord you have to trust him when nothing makes sense don't trust God with your five senses you have to trust God when nothing makes sense three years no rain no deal then God sent him down to abroad and God took an unclean animal to come and feed him when nothing makes sense you have to trust God and I'm telling you we are just getting in deep waters and like the prophet of God said a lot of strange things that would come around that will not make sense to you strange things will come around a strange report now we have the Internet you can put it out there there are things that will come that will make no sense to you but that's when God you want to bring that six thing out
