tech team would just look into their mail there that I sent few notes I want to use quickly before the preacher comes up and uh actually I will have spoken on a message today that I would have dedicated to Fannie Crosby this will be 108 years February 25th when the silver call was broken She Wrote a Song that were aligned there she says the silver car will be broken and I shall see him face to face and tell the story saved by grace so it was on uh February 12th 1915 when Fanny Crosby went to be with the Lord as she was one of the greatest songwriter that the U.S ever had and uh so I thought that I was going to uh he told Brother Hillary Lodge now we were going to sing Fanny Crosby songs he says well we already had our songs together so I said okay I don't want to spoil your program I I don't want to spoil it and but I will buy some of your time so I can do my thing this is my thing praise the Lord amen this is a this is a tremendous life of of a woman this is a tremendous life of let's play the song Jesus keeping the other cross if you can cut the light back up there while we do just go through this quickly has some few Cults here then uh foreign [Music] foreign [Music] ever [Music] till my ride just so shall I find rest Beyond the rest [Music] we sing yeah at the cross oh our dreams trembling sword love ever see fire by meant that the brightest [Music] share and right [Music] in the cross [Music] ing my glory ever oh yes Lord hear my Rapture Soul shall find rest a favor what a musicians Softly playing Crosby was born in 1820 born to an immigrant parents uh in New York City and uh he was actually born in the U.S [Music] and from from a little child just when she was few months old she had an inflammation of her eyes [Music] and the number City doctor was not around so there was another doctor that came and uh prescribed a treatment of putting some warm object over her eyes and it destroyed her eyes glands just from a little baby that was even before she was one years old and uh and and she loves her eyes [Music] and it's amazing woman we have so much of trouble in her life before she will be one year old her father passed away [Music] and uh foreign before she was one year old she lost her eyes before she was one year old her father passed away there's a little perm that she wrote [Music] no let's read the next one sister Katrin she said oh what a happy child I am although I cannot see I am resolved that in this word content I will be how many blessings I enjoy that other people don't so we inside because I'm blind [Music] I cannot known I want she wrote that poem when she was just eight years old so when her dad passed away it was her grandmother her mom had to go to work so she was raised by her grandmother and another and another neighbor lady that hosted him and her grandmother taught her how to um or her grandmother will read the Bible to her so it's it's recorded that when she was 10 years old she could memorize the Book of Genesis Exodus Leviticus and numbers and Matthew Mike Luke and John she could memorize those books not just Bible verses She had the books memorized so that will show how much that had a great influence on her life it influenced her so much and then when she was about 15 years old that was when they had just opened the School for the Blind in uh in New York because the parents moved down to Connecticut I mean uh and then that school of the blind was open then she was taken to that school [Music] and uh there she finished her education and she also became a teacher there at the school but I mean just there's just a lot of tremendous story around time cannot allow us I don't want to take time from the preacher this morning but you know we go through different things in life and different experiences different tough times we love uh lost or loved ones that are dear to us but you see there is something there is something that God designed in a way that uh he allows certain things to come our path in all this great statement brother Branham made that he says the other it's only the things that serve God's purpose will rise again thank you because we have to know that we are not here by ourselves the one that brought us here had a plan when he brought us here he had a purpose of why he brought us here so to just to just disregard his purpose and just try to seek our own pleasure and our own satisfaction uh I mean it's not it's not so it's not a pleasant thing [Music] so there was something you know we can sum up her whole life this morning and and says that uh there was something that uh was so blessed is that even from a young age realizing that she never had a day like that she saw she realized that that this was her purpose and she made the best use of her blindness that she even said one time that even if there was medication for me to see she said I would prefer staying blind because by this blindness it was God's gift to me for me to be a blessing to the word and uh with all you know we read a scripture to silence ago Jesus said blessed I yeed that you have eyes but what we are doing with our eyes is only the god of Heaven Knows let me read this from Brother Branham and then I will close here I don't want to take the preacher's time maybe if the law gave us another opportunity we would take a selfie some days I'm just going back and forth in my notes here brother Brandon shared yet in the message Blind by timush let me take this one he says and then when Fanny Crosby one day when they come to her with these big bargains she was poor too and they came to her and said we will give you so much if you will just give your talent over to making Sons for the entertainment of the word she flatly refused it she would not do it praise the Lord it was it was even said there there uh when her mom passed away and her mom inherited and asked it from her brother the mother brother and her two sisters you know deny her all that but she never took a crush against them she just fell there I mean she lived all of her life just to the service of people not only sounds she was a great writer and also she was a missionary because she would go out to the missions house in in the New York district and then she will she will read her perms you know she would sing songs and she was into your Moody Revival she was one of the great singers there and and uh and many of these men that were running during the revival time they were all having Fanny Crosby singing for them one time she was at the mission house and uh she she was called to give a statement a re-apperman and as she said she says I believe that there is uh there's a boy a year that has uh uh that is running away from his mother's prayer his mother's cried and you know and then right after that Revival a young boy came to to hurt and says was I the one you were talking about I promised my mama that I would self the Lord and Mama went to be with the Lord and I got so I attracted she did not only let that young boy back to the Lord but out of that she wrote the son rescued the perishing care for the dying most of her sons were all inspired by the different things that she was going through she wrote the song Blessed assurance Jesus Is Mine he had a friend called Phoebe so Phoebe had a music Phoebe was playing on the organ she had the music if any Crosby heard that you know she said if anything I have this music I don't have words for it friendly Crosby said just give me a few minutes she went in the room she played the music in her head she came back with the words bless us assurance Jesus Is Mine foreign years old lost her dad before she was one years old she got married she had a baby and the baby passed away before the baby was one years old praise the Lord amen we go through some of the damn things of life some things that are that are of no glory to God just because of our own pride and selfishness and then sometimes we take an attitude on God and take an attitude not even not even coming close to Understanding God's purpose for our lives praise the Lord and brother Branham says here she refused she flatly refused she would not do it she said if there's anything that I have it belongs to Christ and so they the man who were talking to her said then I suppose that you are expecting to go to a world where there will be eternal life and so forth she said yes so what so what do you expect this Christ to be said he will be a man and said then if you if you are the same over there as you are here you didn't never see him said you are blind she said oh I'll know him anyhow they said how will you ever know him if you are still blind over there as you are never had a sight in your life and on the other side if you had no side there how will you know him then she said I will know him and they laugh I've heard and uh and she turned and started through the house when she had made her decision no sir nothing of this word oh my talent is given to Christ she started back across the house and raised up her hands and she said I'll know him I shall know him as I know him and Redeemed by his side I shall stand I shall I know him I shall know him by the prince of the nails in his hands is those great crucial moments The Strain is put upon us that God Moves In when we make the decision for him that's between life and death that little sharp edge sometimes are the last moment when you think you are not going to be well or somebody making fun of you still hold your testimony it's that time that God Moves In Praise the Lord amen one time I'm going to stop right here one time she was uh [Music] she was uh foreign man and the man had his driver taking her back home and they were talking you know and then the man was dropped you know he was ear dropping on the conversation as soon as he realized that this is Fanny Crosby you know he stopped the the the horses stopped the charity and he jumped down out of the chair and took up his heart and he said sir Mrs Fanny Crosby you know he bowed his head she said yes he said oh and then he saw the policeman and said uh he said he said sir come and see Mrs Fanny Crosby the one that sang safe in the safe in the arm of Jesus praise the Lord that was a song that she sung kind of when she lost her baby so as soon as she the man said that the police took his heart and he said just gone Saturday we bury my baby and we sunk that him safe in the arm of Jesus if any Crosby asks him he says uh you know uh talking about the hands and said she said you know all the police and all the real real guys they are all my boys but when you get home tell your wife your baby received in the arm of Jesus listen to our faith [Music] that will be your that would have been uh my next testimony I would have said if you if you look at her songs most of the songs she wrote at the end of her life [Music] she always had a line there when she like this song vision of rapture I shall see him face to face she had an inspiration that gave her more sight than many people that have eyes you understand why Jesus said except you are born again you cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven praise the Lord because Faith gave us a sight that the word do not have a side that is better than the ones your two eyes can see they give you a side to look beyond Behind Your paints it gave you a sight to look behind your sickness that there is a Healer Faith gave you aside through all your trouble you still see a deliverable in your weakness you still see the overcomer Blessed Assurance let's sing death why brother uh Arrow will come Blessed Assurance down [Music] face of Glory divine [Music] case of God oh yes God Hallelujah [Music] this is my song praising my savior [Music] lost my story this is my son oh yeah praise it by savior [Music] have happy life [Music] verse on my side ain't just descended break from above I'm

us one more time now oh this is foreign [Music] amen amen hallelujah visions of rapture now burst on my side amen we are living in that vision to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye as we heard last night we are in the process of change we are in the dispensation of change at any moment we could be caught away in the moment in a twinkling of an eye amen Brian Ferry Cosby had visions of us but we are living in the reality of rapture the dispensation that we'll see the changing of the body from Mortal to immortality and we are living with that promise from day to day it could happen at any moment hallelujah what a blessed testimony what a blessed story of the saint of God blind fatty Cosby amen so while we are standing before we read the word let us just have a word of praying our heavenly father we are so thankful once again this morning oh God for a life Lord that was dedicated for your service life of God that fulfilled your purpose year upon the Earth your Prophet taught us Lord that anything that serves God's purpose there is a resurrection father this morning we are here once again to fulfill your purpose Lord we pray father your blessing upon the service bless the reading of your word may you bless the ministry of your word as we look to you this morning in Jesus Christ's name amen amen let us turn to our Bibles for scripture reading just to get an introduction on brother Peterson I'm from Bible Tabernacle welcome to State and our pastor is brother Harold Beckett and I've been with him for 46 years he actually baptized me also in the name of the Lord and we thank God for the fellowship for all these years and I believe it's the time we are spinning upon the Earth as short-lived if you compare it to what is longer to unfold in eternity amen so this morning I bring greetings from the Saints of like Precious Faith from Bible Tabernacle and the pastor amen regardless she bless you you want to thank Pastor one for the invitation and for the five-star treatment that I received here amen Israel he's really a wonderful man of God may God she bless him and be with him and Grant him the wisdom as he guides the shepherd the Sheep amen the side of the world Amen may God be with him and Grant his heart's desire and may his face shine upon him God bless you amen so we're going to read two portions of scripture Luke chapter 23 and verse 34 and First Corinthians chapter 13. well there is all the verses in verses 1 to 13. Luke chapter 23 and verse 34. then say Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his Raymond and cast lots and now First Corinthians chapter 13 verses 1 to 13. now brother Brian says 13 is the number of a woman amen amen and I believe that this is the bright scripture yes amen and uh charity eight times is mentioned in this chapter in First Corinthians chapter 13 and it is a number of Eternity that's right amen is takes perfect love amen to take us into that rapturing phase amen so I would just like to speak here and we find here that Paul says though I speak now we mentions the word though whenever he says the word though you know it's something that's visible he says though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not charity now charity is something you cannot see but yet it's real yes brother Branham says that charity is deity it's none other than God himself the attribute of God in human flesh so we find that God is above all and he is the center of everything and he says I am become as a sounding brass or a tingling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy again something you can see and understand all Mysteries you can know the older message all the quotations as all human instrumentality and all knowledge and know that I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have no charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profited me nothing can you imagine somebody giving his body to be burned even crucified but if you have no charity you are absolutely doing it in vain you are nothing you see here at the end time we are dealing with the attributes of God being manifested in a mini-membered body worldwide and they are the only ones that are counted in Redemption amen amen charity suffers long and is kind these are not the attributes of charity charity envious not charity wound is not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked think of no evil the joys are not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth Bears all things we live with all things hope with all things endureth all things charity never fails but whether they be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part you see Paul said it was only a partial of Revelation but the fullness was to come at the end time and we are living in that dispensation but with that which is perfect is come When Love Comes when the Capstone comes amen then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things I mean I don't When I visit your home found you playing little cars under on the on the floor and so you put those things away why because you're now a man yes amen for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known when the full Revelation comes and now by the faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen now this morning I'd like to throw some inspiration and the title would be forgiveness because we are living in an hour that we need rapturing faith and faith brother Branham says is based on forgiveness and just to lay a foundation to what I would like to speak on this morning I'd like to read this quotation in the message in the Paradox just to lay a foundation says I was called on a scene a little something going on there was a fine young boy very fine boy he was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family and this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl and much as promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it and instead of coming to her and apologizing like a gentleman should do he just he just wasn't in him to do it he couldn't say I'm sorry forgive me and the father and the mother called me to the scene and I believe that this is the best person they could have called on the scene to deal with this matter and I believe that from the manner that he approached it it's a lesson to us how to approach these things we would desire to know what is wrong with our boy now it's not easy to do sometimes but you must be truthful and honest therefore the boy was a Christian now we're going to see get the the uh what you call it what are all the what do you call the result the resume of the boy yeah as far as a believer he had repented and he had been baptized and he had his position amongst the Believers in other words he could have rejoiced with the rest of the Believers you could have testified as the rest of the Believers could have sang hymns as the rest of the Believers he could even go to the message like the rest of the Believers he did everything like the rest of the Believers but yet not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost no matter how much he thought he had it so from this we see that you may think you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and may not have it but the thing is to know that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and how would you know it is by the life that you live those attributes that comes fourth from being filled with the spirit of God he says here you think you have it brother Branham says and having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion now many people think about emotion it's the evidence that they have the Holy Ghost now listen the way brother Branham approaches this but unless your life is vindicating what you are professing to have you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump run Sensations speak in tongues or shouting or whatever you may lay upon it which is all right I believe in all that when you have the Holy Ghost you can do all those things but doing it doesn't mean you have the Holy Ghost amen I believe in all still but unless your your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it because the fruits of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells you what it is apple tree will produce apples orange tree will produce oranges how would you know it's an orange tree by the fruit that is based so if you are a holy ghost fold Christian the fruits Jesus Says by the fruit you shall know them see by the future shall know them now this young fellow's parents his mother is German now what's the prophet purchase it in the genealogy he goes into the family you see where where does that nature comes from no reflection on the German but there's a strained in that family and that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare you right in the face this girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister I have come down the street many more a morning and this young girl being sitting out in the yard I'd say good morning to you he just looked at me and I'd stop and say sure fine morning Professor went on Friday so many times when somebody ignores us we say well I'll just go my way but the prophet continued the conversation she just looked at me and I'd stop and I'd say sure fine morning she would just stand look at you an intelligent woman I'd say come up to see us sometime she just stand and look well her brothers are that way father and mother is that way so that same nature is rubbed off on this young man that couldn't say I'm sorry now the father of the boy is strictly an Irishman Moody High tempered High Strung that's his whole family that except one other one out of the family converted now in this boy this father and mother both are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the Lord and now the young man is about 17 or 18 years old something along there very fine Keith and he's been a real model at school nice kid and he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girls the mother's family lives to a fine Church but do you think they'd ever come over no and they say it's right but it's not just in them to ask forgiveness you find many many even Christians you know that's my family nature my dad is my mom is like that you know so just take me as I am but you don't expect that from Christians and that's why this morning just to sort of uh speak on this matter on this topic of forgiveness how important it is to be able to forgive he says here they just don't do it is not in them now the genes in the father and mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted Still Remains the flesh that's been integrated out to this boy so the mother and father you can't even go on the testimony of his mother and father he's got to have an experience he's got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and many times when children they are raised in a God-fearing family and they feel that God is a Godfather you know he's a grandfather amen you know he has grandchildren it doesn't work that way brother Brian says God is a father each and every one that comes forth is a son or a daughter you've got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you see it slowly remains in the face therefore the boy has got a complex with him just like his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where that boy stands now I say to the father no matter how much you raise them up now look at you out of the family all of them drunks they fighting and shooting and cutting now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people that just sit there and won't speak very independent see the prophet goes even into the family history to see why that boy is in the condition that he's in it's not you you're the only one of your sisters and brothers and you are sweet and kind and forgiving so those are the fruits of a spiritual Christian they are sweet they are kind and they are forgiving see what does that and you know that you you're the three part of the family tree yet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your Christ that lives in you that's why the Bible says You must be born again amen through your genealogy of your parents your new birth it cancels all that family threat everything that the family has left all that contamination of the family it leaves you when you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are a new creation you are a brand new man all things are passed away all things are now new you are a son and a daughter of God I say to the boy look at your family practically all of them are drunk so uh of course I said and how moody and high tempered and high strung but you are not you're kind and forgiving what is it the Holy Spirit you're no more what you are it's Christ in you now that's the same thing has to happen to your son and the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ see and the water baptism in the pool said I know my son has come to Christ and many believe that it stops with the water baptism the water baptism Only baptizes You Into The Fellowship of the local church but is the Holy Ghost baptism that baptized you into the mystical body of Jesus Christ now you on the body of Jesus Christ amen so from water baptism they've got to continue We Believe unto receiving the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I said that may be all right or outward emotions as we just read what Paul said in First Corinthians chapter 13 the outward emotions he might be identified as a Believer with the Believers but until he's regenerated and born again are advised that young men never to marry that woman so it puts out the parents on the god when the young man wants to marry your daughter or your daughter wants to marry a young man how do we know you know maybe they come on the come in with the Sheep's close the wool you know the skin but the Nature has not changed yet they have never experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so before you say yes sister first pray about it they may have been interviewed with your dad with Holy Ghost and he would be able to discern what's in the young man amen oh the pastor amen come and see my pastor I have a chat with him and see what type of you know Spirit that's upon the man amen these things are verified because after they are married now you see the real person the professor was lingering behind those you know Badger schemes all the time that he wasn't a Christian amen he might be the most spiritual man appear to be the spiritual man but unless he's been received the Holy Ghost amen see brother Branham says he'll make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in then that will be the Paradox in itself is it wonderful that once the Holy Ghost comes in your absolutely changed you used to do those things you you were you you were that person but once the Holy Ghost comes in that's when the change comes you're uh that the old man is dead but now you ought to a Christian your desires are different your conversation is different your conduct is different your nature is different because you're on the new management now you under the management of the Holy Ghost amen let's give the Lord I had a praise this morning amen and brother Branham says that will be a paradox unbelievable I mean many of your friends might know you what you were then but knowing you now when you seizure as a Christian he says I could never believe that you could become a person do what you are today what is it it's the Holy Ghost and that's what we all need it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost we are not going to make it amen he says in itself and that will take the very nature of that boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it the prophet says you can't do it he'll never overcome it Christ will have to overcome it when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the spirit so what are the marks of an overcomer's life a spirit full Christian what other marks of it it's that gentle sweet spirit of forgiveness because of the young man's natural genealogy he could not help for the condition that he was in see and we are in that condition because of what happened in Eden the love part of God was taken away now man is born see he's born in sin shaped in iniquity he comes to the world speaking lies that's why Jesus says You must be born again Hallelujah see so that's the natural genealogy but there's also a spiritual genealogy see and that's pretty spiritual genealogy comes from the attribute of God that overrides your natural human genealogy see it makes you a son and a daughter of God because you find in the final moments of Jesus mission on Earth he had the DNA he had the genealogy of God he says father forgive them for they know not what they are doing his life on Earth was to forgive and to save amen and until the day of his death he was still saying father forgive them for they know not what they are doing it's the life of God brother Brian says here in his Shalom message the other day we were stalking the wife and I we were talking about the hour that we are living in it seems there is to be a time that upon the people that is the most pathetic time that I could think about I have constantly done my very best to try doing disagreeing with a man in religious terms but if I couldn't take his hand afterwards no matter how sharp the thing might be and take a hold of his hand and say this is in the light of a better understanding see and still love that person not just from the lips but from my heart they know then I'm no subject at all to go out there and try to talk to people because you see we must do that we must love that person and going among people in all kinds of classes and different Cults and Clans and religions and so forth and trying to lay the Bible down let's discuss it not from your Creed or from a book of Ethics but from the Bible but if I got one thought that I didn't like that person then I know one thing the spirit of Christ has departed from me there's one thing that's precious to a Christian and that is the spirit of Christ regardless of what you do we must not grieve the spirit of Christ see if I can feel that I don't like that person there's something wrong with me because the spirit of Christ when they were crucifying him and his own people driving the nails you know sometimes I try to picture that nails that steel being driven with a hammer through the palms of a human being it was a very cruel death yeah that Jesus died they were driving the nail through the hands of Emmanuel he was none other than God he said he's very creation that he created was putting the nails that he created back into human flesh and yet with a heart full of love he cried father forgive them for they know not what they are doing the prophet says I've come to a spot I believe that people don't know what they are doing those are the people that we bump shoulders with every day you see this is what he says further it comes he says look like it's become such a subject of evil it's a pathetic thing it seems like there's a shadow of Darkness just over the people that presses them so besides the fact of the birth their natural birth the contamination of the spirits that's upon them there's also the darkness of the hour that's pressing upon the people that's why the people are not by the right mind the only people that has sanity today is the Bride of Jesus Christ Prophet says the only love that they'll be in the world today is amongst the saints of God the bride of Christ amen he says here like for instance One Thing Crossing the nation around and speaking the Lord God identifying vindicating his word and showing that exactly and never let nothings be said unless it comes to pass exactly he says speaking it right out into existence and so forth as he has been doing and people sit and look at that and continue right on in the same condition America should have been a different country today because of what God has done through the ministry of the prophet but she's missed the day of a visitation amen it's the grace of God that has got us here this morning God has given you eyes to see as we have heard this morning and years to hear Jesus says blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for what they have heard unto you it has given the kingdom you have a a sane mind you think positive you think on the things of God he says here and people said and look see not disregarding but like our sisters many times when I speak to them about wearing those clothes and cutting the hair and little things and man how they'll continue on in the creeds and serve under those Creeds and things and they're good people they're fine people but yet it seems like they can't understand look like they can't get it I go back the next year and instead of being any better it's worse see it continues on here's a sister that once had lovely long hair she cut it off here's a man that once looked like he took his stand and went out for the thing that was right he's right back like a dog to his vomit see it seems like there's something that has struck our people it struck the world that they don't seem to have the understanding there's something wrong amen we go to the restaurants we meet you see different people but people are just they are basically influenced by the spirit of the day see what they weigh what they how they speak how they conduct themselves and you as a Christians you've got to go there but as Christians we've got to shine with his darkest is the best place to Shine the Light to show that you are a son and a daughter of God Amen so people do not know what they are doing because of their natural genealogy and the shadow of Darkness of the hour is upon them see so they cannot help for being in the condition that they are because of their natural birth their natural family genealogy so what they need is this genealogy of God to override that see the natural they need a new birth and you go to all the churches brothers and sisters these things are not taught any longer it's more psychology philosophy amen but the only place you'll hear these things is in the confines of the message of the hour you must be born again there must be a change there's got to be a difference amen so there's a spirit of forgiveness only in the word bride she has the spirit of God with inner only the bride can forgive amen the prophecies in questions and answers in law having a shadow I want to listen to you to listen very carefully what he says here forgiving humble spirit that's the way we want to be that's the way we got to be if we ever make the rapture you say well forgiveness is part of it yes faith is based on forgiveness so if we want to make the rapture we have to have a forgiving humble spirit brother Brian says further now when you get like that I'll say your Coming Night unto the Holy Spirit because even sometimes we teach you've got to jump you've got to shout you've got to make a noise and everything teaching that as being the evidence of the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is the life the message is not a lot of information the message has got to become a life we've seen that life lived in our prophets the messenger of the hour and if that message produced that kind of a life in the prophet and that same message will produce the same kind of a life in you Hallelujah you see because every message is what he lived amen he says in the message spiritual food in due season and I want you to get built up this holy Oracles of God in the faith of this hour it's going to take more faith than any that there ever was in any other age for this has to be rapturing faith and I would say it was rapturing Faith you've got to have rapturing forgiveness amen Hallelujah and so we want to believe tonight that in all that we have seen and heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and the Wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and considerate whether it be of God or not and we can all give witness that was not other than God himself Hallelujah he says here in Abram's Grace Covenant we which are alive shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye an old man will be young an old woman will be young and we'll be conditioned remember I spoke about that word last night condition what does the word condition mean to bring something into a desired state for use and God has given us this message to bring us to a desired state to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye he says rapturing faith is in the message and these are one of the requirements is in the message forgiveness amen to meet the promised coming son Glory Hallelujah the next thing in God's honor so we find brother and sister that in the final stages of the bride's mission on Earth to make the Rapture she must come to a place where she says father forgive them for they know not what they are doing in other words they don't know who they are they cannot help for being the condition that they are because of the hour and the time that we are living in so when she becomes him she manifests the spirit of forgiveness she so we won't make the match as a Rapture with a baggage of unforgiveness you've got a problem with this one you've got a problem with that one you still got you know forgive this one and you are not prepared to forgive this one and you know there are still issues that so there's a baggage of unforgiveness upon you we must take the example of Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they are doing we must have rapturing faith and faith is based on forgiveness now brother Branham says you're in perfect faith I actually got this inspiration when I listened to this message perfect faith he says Jesus answering them said have faith for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain now if you read the scripture we find that Jesus first says if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe whatever you said you can have whatsoever you have said but in the verse immediately after that statement he says when you stand praying forgive so if you do not forgive you cannot move the mountain amen see therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father Also may forgive you so we find that the little key thing if you do not forgive now God in human flesh said your father will not forgive you either if you do not want to forgive see but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses now the prophet says now faith is based on forgiveness scripture says faith worketh by love so I worked up a little formula for the Rapture is love forgiveness faith they are both on that two tears Faith worketh by love and faith is based on forgiveness so you've got to have love forgiveness and faith would be equal to the rapture Amen brother Branham says and then when we say to this moon this morning trying to get to a church to a place where we could really see the apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we want such a flow that will be help us flow out to others amen there's a proverb that says to uh is human but to forgive is divine forgiveness is a Divine attribute of God only the Holy Ghost gives you the ability to forgive the prophet once learned a dear lesson when he went to an ordinary little restaurant he says he walked into the restaurant and he looked and there through the policeman with his arm around the woman playing a slot machine Prophet said he was about his age he probably had family at home and Jay was in the restaurant with his arm around the woman amen playing a slot machine and as you look further back into the restaurant you saw young boys drinking and abusing a young girl and then his eyes saw something else in the restaurant a woman about 65 years old sitting with old clothes on with a purple makeup on a mouth now you know as you get older the hand is not so steady anymore you can imagine how it must have been around here trying to get the straight lines and so and on her toenails was also the purple maker and her arms were flabby with a boy's haircut with the Kinky Curls she was busy lighting a cigarette and she had two drunken men that were standing with her and the prophet said oh God how can you look at the thing such as that little Sarah and Rebecca is going to have to be raised in a world like that God why don't you just destroy it and while the prophet stood there criticizing the woman he felt something tugging him and he went to sit in a little booth and God showed him a vision and he looked and he saw the world and around the world was a red streak like a streak of spray you know when you spray aerosol you get a spray a streak in the air amen and this was he said this was the blood of Jesus who died to save sinners and the prophet says this is the reason that God could not destroy her because every Mortal being has a right to Salvation see and you as a mortal you've got to make your decision see until that day comes where you go beyond the blood and then you've got to face the judgments of God but while you're upon the Earth that blood protects you until the day that you accept Jesus as your savior see the one you accept the blood you don't have to stand in the judgments of God you see and they uh because you have already judged so we find that as long as we are here we have a right to the Tree of Life the prophet saw the Lord Jesus in a vision he saw the Thorns around his Brown he saw the drunken spit of soldiers hanging on his face and as he hung there he was jerking and the prophet says what is that my Lord and he says that is your son the prophet saw the blood of Jesus acting as a bumper for his sins if it went beyond the stream of the blood that was around the earth God would have killed him and the stream of blood was like a bumper and the bump is used to protect the car from being damaged amen it catches the blows if you knock the bumper it's easy to replace the bumper but if you knock to the vehicle of course it's going to be more costly to you and the blood of Jesus catches our sin and cries out father forgive them they know not what they are doing the prophet saw his name written in a little old book he was condemned by the judgments of God because God recorded everything that he had done wrong and the prophet crawled up to the feet of Jesus and said Lord Jesus will you forgive me I didn't mean to do it see he said Jesus took his hand dipped it in his side and he wrote across the book pardoned he looked at the prophet and said I forgive you didn't I and the prophet said yes Lord I love you and he says but why are you condemning her then you were condemned once yourself and he freely pardoned you and the prophet says his motive change from that very moment forgiveness became a revelation to the prophet to show that God was showing the prophet he said he has such a mighty Ministry but he couldn't have such a Ministry without forgiveness he was preparing him for the next phase of the ministry to meet the angels and he had to come through that school Hallelujah may the Lord give us a revelation of forgiveness this morning Alleluia there was another occasion where the Prophet was put to the test unforgiveness he says in a message speak to this mountain I stepped out to one side and the spirit of the Lord came upon me and I'll begin to shake and the spirit of the Lord said there's a trap set for you and be thou careful what you say and we left there and I told Brother softman something's fixing to happen and when we got to the meeting that night I said to the audience remember thus saith the Lord there is a trap that is set for me and all of you pray that I'll know what to do the right thing when that comes to pass and the next night it happened the devil sent two people a young boy and a girl to break the meeting and so we were in the meeting this girl looked like a kind of Mongolian but the boy was just holding they were both at least 25 years of peace but such immoral acts in the church they were sitting about this far from me and I started preaching he would just grab her and throw her head back and climb up on her and kiss her and Carry On and just act awful in the meetings and the ashes couldn't make him be quiet and I said to him from the platform I said young man don't do that you're attracting attention while I'm preaching and he just left and right at that time I thought oh oh there it is there's the Trap right there I went right ahead speaking just the same and oh he got Immortal with her tell her I had to stop again and said don't do that sir if you want to make love to the young lady then you leave the building but this is a religious meeting and I said you shouldn't do that don't please don't do that while I'm preaching I started again and it just made it worse and then I said don't and something said to me say what you will and it will be done I stood there Mr Mercer the table and all of them standing by the Fred and many of them standing present the perspiration was just running all over me something said say blindness it will be blind say death and they'll pack them out say what you will I couldn't speak I couldn't move and I just left I thought God what must I do and I turned and he stood and there his face white looking at me I thought what must I say then I turned and looked like before I knowed what I said see what I had said I said I forgive you for your act see he said before I know what I have said in other words the Holy Ghost absolutely Beyond his thinking the Holy Ghost came and it must have been just the right thing to say it was God trying a reaction on an action that night it was revealed to me that I said the right thing I know it was all leading to something but what was it what to do you know you have to watch with a Divine gift what you do with it remember what Moses did God said go and speak to the Rock and he went to Smite The Rock Moses was the prophet God had to do whatever the prophet said or did amen and God wouldn't allow Moses to go to the promised land because of what the act that he did a Divine gift that got him into trouble amen for you know John the young John wanted to burn up some area one time because they wouldn't feed them Jesus says you don't know what kind of a spirit you are the son of man came to save life not to destroy it I actually went to the scripture to read what Jesus actually said in John chapter 12 verses 47 to 48. he says if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not remember when he came he came as Savior he came not as the judge but he came to forgive he came to love he came to die for the sins of the world that's why I said I came not to judge but to save the world that's when they brought that woman that was caught in the act of adultery they brought her to Jesus and said Jesus what do you say she was caught in the act now according to the law she had to be stoned but he said to them If any man have the I have no son that him caused the first stone and when he turned up he said that everybody was gone and he asked the woman where are your accusers she said they are all gone he says neither do I condemned me why he did not come as judge but he came as the savior he came to forgive see he said he that rejected me and received not my words has one thing that one that judges him the word which I have spoken that's what the very message that we believe that will give us rapturing faith it's the same message that will condemn the world the message that will the world will be judged by is the message of the hour the message that they have rejected amen Hallelujah so they'll be judged by the word that God has sent in this hour see the word that I've spoken the same shall judge him in the last day see and brother Brandon says then scriptures keep pouring over all night I didn't sleep but that was a step that Satan would get me all worked up and then make me say something wrong but the Holy Spirit was there and told me beforehand to be careful he says oh for the goodness of God amen amen I think they sing a song nowadays oh for the goodness of God Amen I'm kept by the goodness of God I'm saved by the goodness of God we are all sitting here this morning because of the goodness of God if it wasn't for the goodness of God we would not be here this morning Hallelujah the prophet says just his mercy be careful what you said and from then on there was a relief come I begin to notice the different things that I would speak out unconsciously not knowing what I said and it would happen that way I begin to speak about it now one would might ask the question where did unforgiveness have a beginning it started in the Book of Genesis God said the day you eat thereof that day you shall die and When sin come in sin came in because of disobedience and the prophet says that it separated Divine love God told Adam and Eve not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so what did son do it brought a separation between the love of God and man and it brought him and envy and strife and Division yeah amen because the love of God was no longer there Prophet says when you separate Divine love then you can't look at your brother's mistakes anymore you cannot say you do not know what you are doing you ball him out see you cannot Overlook a sister's mistakes because you got away from the Divine part that's right amen the love part but he says we are really love the Lord if the brother or sister does something wrong to you you will say oh well you didn't mean to do it it takes the grace of God to tell somebody that if they've done something wrong to you I forgive you you didn't mean to do it you know and I believe that God showed his feeling to the world when he represented himself in Jesus he expressed his nature to the human race to forgive and to love those who are unlovable amen and God revealed his divine nature to the end time messenger so that we could understand the feelings of God to love and to forgive amen all these little stories that brother Bram told us it was his experience the love of God forgiveness how that we have to follow walk that same path as he will Prophet said Jesus was the first representation of love that ever was on the Earth he was the spies of Those whom he loved no man ever loved like him and no man was ever hated like him they hated him despised him they rejected him but he did not stop his love Isaiah 53 says he's despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we heed as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not you know what the word esteem means respected honored revered valued admired we did not admire him you know we like to be respected and revered and acknowledged but Jesus Emmanuel God With Us we esteemed him not he said surely he had borne our grief and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and why he stripes we are healed Hallelujah amen you know what the prophet says that he being God understands that's why he could love that's why he could say father forgive them they don't know what they are doing Isaiah 53 says he was a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief amen he walked amongst men he dressed like ornery men you wouldn't have known him from the other men amen you could stand in the midst of congregation and he could speak brother Brandon says when he spoke is like the words coming from his very heart he spoke it with deep sincerity Hallelujah it was the words coming from his heart that really knew what he was talking about did you recognize that Jesus never corrected what he said before every word he spoke was perfect he didn't say well you know I said something and I've just come to say I've got to correct that no every word was God's word every word was perfect even the soldiers who came to him they went back and said never a man spoke like him you could calm the storm Hallelujah you could raise the dead why it was God in human flesh amen the prophet says we can be like him he said just get him in your heart he'll make you humble when someone smites you on the one side of the face God bless you brother I know you didn't mean it it really takes the grace of God it takes a man filled with the Holy Ghost you say God bless you amen I know you didn't mean it amen they didn't realize that they were piercing the hands of Emmanuel God in human flesh forgiving Hallelujah the prophet says that's the way we got to be if we ever want to make the rapture we are preparing for rapturing faith and he manifested perfect love for a perfect Resurrection when Jesus died upon the cross of Calvary the last words that he mentioned father forgive them because of that forgiveness there was a resurrection because of forgiveness there was a Rapture on the Ascension Day why because he could forgive Allelujah him being God he died on a cross friendless even forsaken by God the prophet says they made him a proposition you come of the Cross and we will accept you as the Messiah not knowing that the Angels were sitting amongst the trees as as he was hanging upon the cross of calvary they said you saved others and yourself you cannot save but he gave himself for others he came as our Kinsmen Redeemer amen if he never paid the price there would be nobody that was worthy to take the book and to lose the seals thereof but because that he was the worthy one he was wounded for our transgression amen as the songwriter says when he was on the cross I was on his mind hallelujah amen hallelujah and you find here as as Paul says though I speak with tongue of men and angels and though I have faith to move mountains and have not charity I am nothing brother and sister it's faith forgiveness and it's love let me just read a little something here as we come to the close we find here I just want to skip a lot of things brother Branham says here you know that so we find that the final stages of the bride's mission on Earth to make the Rapture she must come to a place which is his father forgive them they know not what they are doing you know we must have rapturing faith and faith is based on forgiveness Prophet says only perfect love will enter in perfect love holds no grudges perfect love holds no scores to settle so there's anything that disturbs your spirit you feel anything funny in your spirit have it sorted out amen because with that baggage on you you'll never make the rapture and I believe we are living in the hour of rapture we've got to be cleansed of all those contaminations of our family lineage of the dispensation we are living in we are busy we are in the change amen a change has come since the opening says the visitation of Melchizedek we are preparing for to enter a place of perfection and only perfect love can enter that place and God sent us a message to condition us for that place to prepare us for that hour of rapturing faith now can you imagine brother and sister looking to a rapture and these things will slow on you unforgiveness you have schools to settle one group against the other group you know that's man but here we have a prophet that came to show us get rid of all that baggage forgive love amen there's got to be a Unity a Oneness the love of God has got to unite us together oh love of God how rich and pure how fathomless and strong it shall forevermore endure the Saints an Angel song they'd be closed by reading this and I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room and says this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there is no jealousy there's no tiredness there's no death sickness could never be there mortality could never make you old and they could not cry it was just one big Joy oh my precious brother we are going to a place of perfection and God is conditioning us here to enter that place of perfection amen forgiveness love hallelujah amen may God made us be a help to you and what you heard that will help you in your Christian walk upon the Earth maybe something has opened your eyes this morning maybe you never realized what does work work entails forgiveness love and faith may God does she bless you amen shall we all stand can we sing a song the love of God is greater far than Tango pen and ever say Amen the love of God he is [Music] foreign [Music] to read his hearing child God oh love of God our champion I'll measure lands and strong foreign [Music] when our old time shall pass away [Music] refuse to pray [Music] love social try still in dear our measurement and strong redeeming great to I always [Music] oh my full love of God oh love of God I reject you I measureless [Music] now since [Music] Powerhouse together [Music] Jesus laid up a parable he laid a parable he laid a principle in a word where he talks about a man that was forgiven you know brother Brandon Jesus brought the same experience down to brother Brandon brother Arrow red brother Brandon story theater in the restaurant but yet Jesus in his life here on Earth tell another story of that about a man that was forgiving but yet he could not forgive the ones that owe him lesser penny but I think that was that is prominent in that story is that Jesus said let he be turned over to the tomatoes so brother Branham over in the message demonology make us to realize that tomatoes in the Bible are demons so he said when we hold unforgiving spirit in US we are subjecting ourselves to demon powers [Music] we are subjecting ourselves we are we are relinquishing the liberty of the spirit to be able to exercise faith and then we are giving ourselves over to fears and doubts and and all of those things as humans we deal with things we meet with people there are things that uh that I've hurt us but you see the principle thing here like our brother share this morning you think about it think about it that was just that was just before brother Branham going into the opening of the seals just before he could go to that purpose of his life God is telling him a trap except for you and let me say that to us this morning a trap is set for you this word is a trap don't don't look for a vision this word is a trap when you leave from here this morning the word out there is a trap it is how you will react to the actions and the attitude of the people you are stepping into a trap [Music] is how you condition your mind is how you place yourself you you season your words with Grace how you prepare your heart before you leave your house in the morning there are sometimes we we are faced with things we we the way we deal with it we are very embarrassed because it do not

is a very precious brother very precious and uh and then that we all respect and uh highly respect and brother but Baker is uh he's he's one of his kind one of his kind a very very different man very different man Holly highly disciplined very very different in a way he does things praise the Lord amen and uh he has a good teaching gift he's a teacher in a way that he approached things and uh but he's he's a different man he's a different man different in the sense of he has a unique way that he approached things you sit around with him you learn a whole lot you learned a whole lot going a whole lot I mean he could have been one of the blessing and Rich preachers around the message and he takes what he gets from the ministry and help other churches he have built a lot of churches around and support other Ministries and we are doing a little little printing work there you know to be able to spread the message out so he's he's highly respected and assaulting part of Africa and I believe in other parts of the world so so he's a man that's that's humble you in a way that he does things wow [Music] talked with him back in 2004. before my first trip to South Africa and he said brother one you get in South Africa let me know after your meetings we were having service down in Durban and but I think just around that time he he lost his brother or his daughter so he texts me and oh send me an email and said you know because of this who will not me but then we kept in contact yeah we met towards the early part of the 2000s we had a preacher no the later part of 2000 I think 2008. a convention in Togo together he was the principal speaker so we were just helping the meetings giving time to rest and uh so he said man that we we do respect and appreciate but send our greetings to to brother praise the Lord say brother one say it's Salud the next time we are back there we will make sure that we stop to see him praise the Lord the Lord bless you let's stand on our feet and uh we enjoy the fellowship with our brother praise the Lord we enjoyed our fellowship you know the scripture says blessed are the feet that brings good Tiding amen so it is not uh it is not uh sometimes as a people you know the congregation can be very selfish you know the the just they just look to the place where they can kill the preacher you know pull everything out of you where you are tired struggling for your breath to go yeah yeah we enjoy the service but sometimes is is uh is is the years of experience that the person brings a man that has been been following the word and living a consecrated life think about this brother Branham says when when John returned from the island of Palm Coast he was not a man of [Music] because of the things that he saw on the foreign so you see it's not the excitement it's not the it's not the emotion is that it's behind because you can get some of these smart guys that will come and turn the code this way praise the Lord and they are terrible in their lifetime terrible in their lifestyle you see some of the things that they are doing in the name of the message so it's the experience is the experience for me you know is is more of a blessing for me because I learned from those things I learned from it just sit down with a person talk to them there are few things you pick up slip them under the fifth rape slip it under my fifth rape but the Lord bless you let's go in the Peace of the Lord I love to see you on Wednesday night and uh have a wonderful have a wonderful weekend you asked me what I'm happy let's sing that
