to have you okay praise the Lord amen so you know if if I make a mistake you know exactly I get home I get corner I go go straight in the corner I back up in the cor you love the Lord tonight St John Chapter 12 St John chapter 12 I had this thought for some time now the last time I was over over in Tennessee uh uh I think it was in Tennessee I can choose Tennessee but it was one of those places and uh just uh steuding and and looking through the word praying this thought came to me I really didn't that look at it has uh uh taken the message out of it and but uh uh it came on my heart this afternoon so let's just look into it and and trust that the Lord will add his Blessing to it tonight praise the Lord in John chapter 12 we read from verse one watch this now watch this we we we have been instructed by the Holy Spirit to pay attention when we are reading the word amen the scripture says then Jesus six days six days before the Passover praise the Lord amen six days before the Passover and he was the Passover uh lamb amen six days before the Passover where Lazar Lazaro was which had been dead whom he had raised from the dead there they made him a supper and M but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him Jesus then took Merit a p of uh of anointment of uh spil very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wept his feet with her head and the house was filled with the order of the anoint men then said one of his disciple Judas ascar Simon son we should betray him wow they put everything here all his credentials amen his birth certificate is here his credential is year Simon son we should betray him why was not this uh ointment sorry ointment I kept saying anointment ointment why was not this ointment sold for 300 pennies and given to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put in it so does that mean he was stealing some of the money well we don't know then said Jesus let her alone against the day of my burial have she kept this for the [Music] poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came n for Jesus sake on it but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead but the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus praise the Lord amen then verse 12 say and on on the next day much people that will come to the feast so that's the Passover is referring to so this took place one day before the Passover praise the Lord let's pray together father we uh want to thank you again Lord that we have the opportunity to read a portion of your word father God which is very important very important Heaven and Earth Earth will pass away your word will not pass away you told us your word is settled in heaven precious Lord we have uh what we have oh God but it's a word that is already set to establish oh god father so we just pray that Lord you will break a portion to us tonight something oh God we can Fellowship around something that will be said oh God to draw us closer to you and Lord God go in the direction tonight and I just pray that father the Holy Spirit we capture us our mind he he would just bring us to the place that he want us to pay attention to so we ask that you take complete control tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father I also want to thank you Lord God for brother Ezekiel little son D here that had a uh a surgery sometime this week removing a tumor oh God that he was suffering from we want to thank you and we pray that God you would bring healing to the young man oh Father I pray for their family as well our dear brothers sister s the children we commit them into your hands and we ask that Lord God you would just you'll be with them you will help them we thank you Father Lord and we just commit all things in your hands now in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord now so when you look in the scripture here this uh this account of uh of the woman uh uh uh watching Jesus feet with her tears and uh uh anointing him uh you will see that uh there are two different accounts now sometimes to be able to understand uh uh because some of the SCS in the Bible look alike it's almost like Matthew chapter 24 in Luke chapter 24 if you study those two chapters closely you will realize there is there is one verse that shows the difference praise the Lord one of the verse uh uh make us to know that Jesus you know uh his disciple took him on top of the mountain and show him you know the mountain where he said that not one stone will be left upon another praise the Lord but then in the Luke account Jesus has just finished teaching in the synagogues when he stepped out and then he started repeating the same thing he said to them on top of the mountain now if you remember when we did the LA's prayer when you read the account it looks like Matthew gave his account and Luke gave his account of the Lord's Prayer but when you look at the setting of the scripture you will realize it's two different account praise the Lord it is the same with this with this uh uh uh story that we have just read of this woman that uh uh this woman that you know uh wash jesus' feet year the Bible make us to know it's mered but if you look through the other account it's not really it's not really said you know her name is not called a certain woman the Bible call but uh uh if you look in the Luke account Luke account uh uh tells us that it was it was in uh uh Simon house praise the Lord so it was these Pharisees that sent Jesus sent for Jesus to come to this place so Luke account make us to know that it was in Salon house here in uh uh uh Matthew I mean John account this was in the house of Lazarus and his sisters praise the Lord now whether it was was married that was the same in Luke account and she's the same one repeating this in join account we are yet to know in most in most places uh uh uh you know is is uh it's been said that it was married and uh and you know we can we can just go through all the scripture we not we're not trying but I'm just only trying to to help us to see tonight that sometimes in reading the scripture if you just look this look at the setting you realize that is different from the other accounts that that you have read sometimes it's just one thing that makes the difference in as much as it looks like the SC because the gospel have it have repetition because every one of them was giving their account of uh their time with Jesus so it you know the the stories are are the same praise the Lord but that's not what we are looking at uh tonight what we want to look at tonight uh uh goes back to uh it goes back to uh uh uh a prophecy o my my my are you ready to travel with me tonight praise the Lord it goes back to to a prophecy that uh that had to do with Daniel 70 week okay I want to bring that I want to bring us from that place and use there to kind of for lay lay a foundation here if I can get through this that would be beautiful praise the Lord so let's let's go back to Daniel 7 week I mean the Book of Daniel sorry I said Daniel 7 week let's go into the Book of Daniel tonight uh Daniel chapter 9 verse 24 Daniel chapter 9 verse 24 now Daniel chapter 9 verse 25 for will give us uh uh uh an idea on uh uh everything that is prophesied to happen within the 7th week everything that is prophesied to happen within the 70 week I'm I'm really believing the Lord to to be able to drive this in the place that uh uh it will not go into much of a teaching tonight but uh I don't know I don't have the staring you have it so verse 24 says yeah 70 week are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sin and to reconcile and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in Everlasting righteousness and to seal up the visions and prophecy and to anoint the most holy praise the Lord are we together amen now so uh uh when the angel Gabriel came down to Daniel uh uh this was this was what he mention to Daniel making Daniel to know you know that God uh uh you know Daniel was praying in concerning his people and uh you know and uh the Prince of Persia was fighting against his prayer and and uh when the angel Gabriel bro broke through the angel told him that uh uh this is a time period This is a time period that is set for the people now you remember when we ever ever read this couple of weeks back we make you to know that uh the 70 week is not 70 days week we have 70 days week when a person says 70 week we can count them uh uh uh seven days in a week four week in a month you know but the Jews have weeks of years weeks of months weeks of weeks and weeks of days so so uh uh this was actually talking about weeks of years now so uh uh the angel is letting uh uh Daniel to know that uh 70 weeks of years is determined upon your people and in this period of time these are the things that are going to happen praise the Lord amen these are the things that are going to happen the things that are going going to happen is that uh uh um transgression will be finished the the and to make the end of sins and and to reconcile make reconciliation of the iniquity uh uh and to bring Everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy and he went on and says know therefore and understand there from the GL forth of the Commandment to restor and to build Jerusalem which of course that uh uh we know that uh sarus was the one that uh you know uh uh was was prophesied by Isaiah he will be the Sant that will give them this instruction so from the from that going forth the 70 week now all of this from the going forth of that commandment onto maiah the prince shall be seven weeks in the 7th week from that time where uh uh uh uh sarus who gave the the Commandment for them to go and and deal to the time of mesiah which is Jesus Christ that will be seven weeks are we together Amen to maiah is going to be S weeks and uh uh three school and two weeks the street shall be built again the walls even in Troublesome time that's the time of neemias you know or the time of Ezra and all of that so that's that's not uh our whole study is not around uh uh uh the 70 week tonight but what what what attract me to this is in this prophecy there was a promise that the most holy will be anointed praise the Lord amen amen that in the period in this period of time that after the time of uh transgression Everlasting righteousness sealing up the the vision and prophecy the most holy will be anointed now so I was I was I was uh uh thinking about this story of the woman that that anoint uh uh our lord Jesus now you think about it now think about it because there's a reason why in in uh in uh Matthew uh I mean in St John Jesus told uh uh Judas uh L her you have the poor with you but she's doing this for my burier why because right after his burial he's going to enter into his priesthood Ministry are we together why Jesus was on the earth he identified himself under the son of man right which is a prophet so he was he was under a prophetic Ministry are we together amen but he had another Ministry which was the priesthood and as and as a priest I call into Leviticus we look into it before the priest goes into the holy place to offer sacrifice he has to wash his hands and wash his feet and be anointed for that service are you seeing the picture here so Jesus is saying that it's strange enough when you look at this you read down the Bible says in verse 10 but the chief priest consulted that they might put Lazarus to death so all of these people came they all came to see lazarra that was raised you know the high priest they all sent their their counil men you know they all dress up and behave like friends that were coming for dinner that night but you see they came to see really is he alive because we got to kill that guy we got to destroy the evidence praise the Lord they wanted to destroy the evidence but here said there the uh in the midst of that Amen in the midst of that the Leviticus order the levitical order was there the priest needed to be prepared and in some other preparation for the priest to go behind the veil to be able to offer the sacrifice to take the blood from from uh uh uh uh uh The Altar and take it behind the veil and and and present it on on behalf of the people this Spirit has to be anointed for that are we together so you see in another in another gospel Jesus said that what this woman did as long as the gospel is preached it will ever be remembered yes why because if she never did it our high priest would not step into his office and Jesus Jesus priesthood office he stepped into it when when he was dead that's why he told Mery don't touch me I must go to the father because he have to go beyond the vill are we together praise the Lord amen so you see you see what you see the the the you see the picture you see you see what I'm getting to by bringing the the the St of this woman now that is not the Fulfillment it's not the Fulfillment of anointing the most holy that's not the Fulfillment we will get into that praise the Lord amen you see because uh when when I when I thought about that uh uh it kind of lingered around my mind a little bit and uh uh uh uh I thought I said well okay uh you know i' I Was preparing for service there and and I was going to preach and so I I was I didn't want to get out of what I needed to preach that night but I had this thought at the back of my mind so let's let's let's just Fellowship around it tonight are we together amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord so yeah we are seeing that uh she's uh she's she did something very very very very important very very very very important praise the Lord amen she did something very important to anoint him for him to be able to step into his prechool preschool office now if you read Acts chapter 10 let's let's let's go to Acts chapter 10 verse 38 Acts chapter 10 that's right after the book of uh uh uh St John acts chap 10:38 not having much time tonight so we will just go right in there verse 38 says how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and and uh healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him now so uh uh uh uh Peter is bearing record here of what took place at the Jordan River are we together amen are we together amen are we together praise the Lord my job is to keep us together amen I don't want to lose you so uh uh Peter was testifying of what took place at the Jordan River so when Jesus Jesus at the Jordan River which of course that is what happened with in in in in in Israel a prophet a priest and a king that's right amen whenever they are taking office praise the Lord amen are we together they have to be anointed for their office that's right Saul was anointed David was anointed you know that one amen the same thing also with a prophet yes Elijah took his metal and he threw it on Elisha that's right praise the Lord and it started to have an effect on Elija he went and burned all his things and kiss his parents goby and he jumped behind Elijah are we together amen amen so Jesus at River Jordan John the Baptist the prophet identified him as the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world yeah Peter is testifying that Jesus was anointed of the Holy Ghost so he was watched as a l by the prophet and he was anointed by God are we together amen glory be to God hallelujah amen you love the Lord tonight amen let's give the Lord a hand of Praise [Applause] amen hallelujah I just don't want you to sleep with me now so uh uh that that was a tabernacle order Leviticus let's drop down to Leviticus chapter 8 very quickly I pick up one verse here you can go go home and do the rest of the reading Leviticus chapter 8 I'm just trying to stir your pure conscience tonight amen by the way just like I told you on Sunday I'll be going this weekend for the for a wedding uh uh uh a good friend uh uh one of our our boys our son Moses grew in our hands as a little boy just like uh God's Will and uh Emmanuel rose up to be our piano player in the church there and uh uh so uh the parents are around he's doing his wedding this weekend he asked that we come uh wanted me to come with the entire family but I will represent them and represent the church here amen so uh so the Bible says here verse 10 uh Leviticus 1810 Moses took the anointing oil and Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was therein and Sanctified them and he sprinkled he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and Anointed The Altar water and all the vessel both the lava and his foot to sanctify them praise the Lord and he and he ped the all the anointing oil upon Aaron head and anointed him and sanctify him so this is the prophet preparing the priest and the entire uh Tabernacle and everything that is in the Tabernacle the prophet is preparing it for the service of the Lord Lord that's the reason why everything has to be brought under the order of the word we just don't run the church is not run on good ideas right the church is run on God's order amen praise the Lord it run on God's order as he has given it to his his Prophet now so when you look also in uh in in Hebrews chapter 9 let's look in Hebrews chapter 9 you realize that Paul brought is also talking about uh a better Covenant that this that was done now we have a better Covenant so just what Paul was trying to do in Hebrews chapter 9 let's read it together what I didn't wanted to do is what I'm doing I didn't want it to teach because I'm not a teacher now so Hebrew chapter 9 verse 19 for when Moses has spoken every precept to all the people according to the Lord so Moses read the Commandment he read the word he read all the precept he took the blood of the Cal and of the god with water and and uh uh and Scarlet wood and hup and sprinkle both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the the the testament which God has joined onto you so the people and the book just like John says the bride and the spirit said come so when Moses do there he says by this by what I have done by sprinkling you you you are joined to the word praise the Lord amen you are joined to the word that's that is the same significance that communion has to the believer are we together amen praise the Lord amen so when when when when we take it not dishonoring the Lord's body we are guilty of it if we don't take it when we supposed to be take taking it we are also guilty of it so the only way to get out of it is to repent and take it is to make your life right and take it there is no way to to stay out of it you have in it does not make you free praise the Lord it don't make you free because you are already joined by accepting Christ by accepting the word you are joined to that are we together now so so okay now so we see here the Bible says moreover he sprinker with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessel of the ministry now that's a reason why I'm reading this I'm I'm I'm going to get there there's a reason why I'm reading this uh I'm going to get there uh by the grace of God hallelujah amen now so you will see that uh uh look at when the temple was dedicated when Solomon Temple was dedicated 2 Chronicle chapter 5 think about this when when when every everything was put in its place everything was set in order according to the Commandment of the Lord amen everything was put in his place the Bible says that things were set so much in order and and and uh uh uh when when they were when they were placed in their position and uh and and the and the priest came the Bible says the glory of the Lord amen filled the temple so much that even the the minister did not had a place because the the Tabernacle was filled with the glory of God why because everything was set right in their place right amen that is an order for the church if everything is in his place the glory of God will come that is is an order for the believer's individual life if everything is in place the glory of God we come that is the order for our home if everything in place the glory of God will be there are we together amen why because God inhabits his people yes amen he inhabit the Bible says he inhabit the Praises of his people but it's more in the sense the Praises is not just dancing to the drums and and the piano and the song leader leading song no we praise God when we have things in order right amen the Bible says the heaven declare the glory of the Lord why because it's in his place so when things are in order then God inhabits his people are we together it is not how much we know about how it must be in order no it's not the knowledge of it being in order it's it it's it's is it being in order it must be in order not just having the knowledge oh I know I supposed to do this I know no do it let's let's let's just do it because God do not inhabit our knowledge no right he inhabit our praise praise the Lord he he inhabit Our Praise You might not be singing a song in praising God but when you are living right and dressing right why you are declaring the glory of God you are praising God Amen praise is not only the song that we sing it's even in the life that we live it's in the things that we say speaking the truth always you are praising God because what he Delights in the truth are we together so when everything was put in place then the glory of God came down Hallelujah amen are we together praise the Lord so let's travel a little bit here so while I was looking at this I decided to go quickly back in and just pick up some few thoughts to share with you tonight when brother B talks about anointing the most holy it's beautiful if you pay attention you will really enjoy it it's very beautiful I promise you you'll really enjoy it amen because it's the reveal word amen you will not enjoy because I'm saying it you will enjoy because it's the truth amen you will enjoy because Prophet has given it to us so let's let's re a little bit and uh I'm just I'm just picking few Year from uh uh this say for purpose now to anoint the most holy now this may be a little bit strange for just a few few minut to many of you teachers praise the Lord just hold it just a minute see how it comes out this is the anointing Jesus is already anointed is that right the book of Acts said that God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost that's what we just read Amen in Acts chapter 10 and he went around doing good and Healing The Sick and so forth that's what makes him the mesiah because the mesiah means the anointed one amen he will not be called the Messiah if he was not anointed he testified of it right in the synagogues when he takes took the book and he read from Isaiah and said the spirit of the Lord God is upon me he was testifying of his anointing I'm anointed to pick this book up and speak to you and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled are we together so he's already anointed his the Messiah and the Messiah means the anointed one is that right and yeah at the end time he's to anoint the most holy so so watch now where we going now amen when you think about anointing the most holy what comes to your mind who is the most holy Jesus Jesus Jesus and this this was a prophecy to the Jews concerning what will happen in their 70 week period they are promised that the most holy will be anointed amen praise the Lord so yeah now uh uh uh uh the the prophet have have thrown the line into into the lake and and and he want to get a cash now he want to get a cash so he's making us to know that the scripture testify to us that he was already anointed amen he says but then it says but yeah at the end time he's to anoint the most holy what is what what is the most holy so my way of seeing it which I believe I can prove it by the scripture is to anoint the most holy which will be the Tabernacle that will be used during their Millennium praise the Lord the Tabernacle that will be used during the millennium are we together praise the Lord am I making you sleepy are you interesting uh uh interested in grapping what is what is this Most Holy tonight praise the Lord because I know most of you are Are all uh uh you all driving speeding cars when a preacher is saying one you have gone hit the W and you came back sometimes you finally you you missed the road praise the Lord so I know your minds are all going all over the place but like I said pay attention to me it's very interesting amen amen so we realize that the the most holy brother bam says will be the Tabernacle that will be used during the Millennium praise the Lord hallelujah that's not our future home that's our honeymoon right amen that's our honeymoon and what is what is promise what is promis doing the Millennium the most exciting thing that is Promised doing the Millennium is that you having 1,000 years on your hands praise the Lord I don't know what you plan to do you better start making plans because you have 1,000 years on your hands the Lord and most thing also there is that Satan will be B amen you will not have to worry about evil thought you don't have a devil to fight amen you don't have a devil to fight you don't have to worry whether you going to tell the truth or not you will just tell the truth praise the Lord amen you have we have 1,000 years on your hands without the devil praise God amen praise the Lord amen amen he said well then I will be on fire for God we all will be on fire for God we need your fire right now amen praise the lord we need your fire right now amen praise the Lord because we see a lot of Darkness around us we see you know uh the enemy trying to squeeze her in so we need your fire right now so so he says here he says I can prove it by the scripture and he's going to bring us into Ezekiel you know he's going to bring us into Ezekiel chapter 43 and and and you know he's going to read I I could we could all read that together but let's let's let's just uh uh save our time for for this Wednesday night talk that we have together but I want you I want you to just stay right in there with me now see brother B comes down again he said so that the priest stood praise the Lord so that the priest to the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud now he's talking about when Solomon Temple was dedicated and everything was in his place think about it now in the Millennium everything will be in his place everything will be in its place place it will it will be just like when when when Adam was turned over to Eden when God gave him to Eden everything was in his place are we together so see how he's bringing it now he's bringing it from the Tabernacle being in order where the glory of God came down amen now so let's let's go on a little bit here he says here and uh uh uh for the glory of the Lord have filled the house of God God came into the sanctuary that was to be anointed and was giving over to him for the people to come and worship to come and worship that is one of our element for the Millennium worship now so he says so to anoint not not the holy Place amen not the holy place the promise in Daniel is not to anoint the holy place is to anoint the most holy are we together amen now watch and see what he says here he says but to anoint the most holy the most holy place and we notice that we notice that New Jerusalem is the most holy place and the anointing will be upon the New Jerusalem that discern from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Ador for or her husband I don't know what you see there tonight praise the Lord amen I take it back again brother Bram says the promise is not to anoint the most holy place is to anoint the most holy so the most holy is a person are we together amen but then he brings us to a place and the place that he brings us to is the New Jerusalem coming down praise the Lord the New Jerusalem is a place yeah but the anointing was for the most holy but this New Jerusalem that is coming down the Bible says is as a BRI so you get it you get the picture praise the Lord do you get the picture amen hallelujah amen so the bride was in was in this representation of a city like Jesus said in Matthew Chapter 5 you are a city that is on a hill that cannot be hid you are a city now you have have to remember that Revelation is a book of symbol John was looking at an a a city coming down but actually it was the bride are we together are you getting the picture amen actually it was the bride so that is the reason why uh uh he's saying it here it's almost like brother Bram said saying something and and and trying not to say it praise the Lord because if you can grab the symbol if you can grab the symbol and know what it represent you know exactly what he's talking about are we together so because he's already anointed that anointing of the most holy and is the temple for the millennial then what will it be it be the bride it is it will be the bride are we together now so it makes more sense that brother brandom said there everything wrong will be made right because everything will be in this place amen everything will be in its place can you imagine we we we come to the world born in sin shly in iniquity come to the word speaking lies praise the Lord and one of these days we will step we will step on the Millennium Shore with no trace of our first birth with no desire of sin amen no evil thoughts praise the Lord and everything that we have ever struggled with will be gone praise the Lord now if you have to go on a honeymoon and be worrying for how you will pay for your wedding you never did a good job praise the Lord you never did a good job you're not going to to I mean you mess that honey with some kind of a bitter pill praise the Lord amen so we going on the honeymon where we will be stress free Satan is Bound for the Thousand Years and the bride is going to be stress fre praise the Lord I don't want to preach tonight don't make me to don't make me to please are we together amen Lord amen so it's almost like when Jesus said in my father's house are many Mansion but says it's not Mansion of braks right praise the Lord so it's all it's it's the same as uh h h h h you know the the the the millennial Temple so he's bringing us to this place to realize just like Jesus was the type of the temple that that Moses built in the wilderness Jesus was the type of the temple that Solomon built he was the type of the temple that zarab and the rest have to restor and then when he came he stood and said destroy this Temple and three days I will raise it up right amen praise the Lord because all the temple that were built right from the beginning was speaking about that man it was speaking about that body amen praise the Lord praise the Lord that is the same way that the bride right from Ephesus amen all the redeem all the redeem glory be to God all the redeem is going to be the millennial Temple praise the Lord amen think about back in Eden IAM never had a physical building like this one to worship yeah praise the Lord when it was time to worship Elohim came down and he was in the spirit of worship because he was in the temple that was connected to praise he was in a perfect body with perfect thoughts when your thoughts are right your your energy AR right you can praise God anywhere at any time amen glory be to Goden praise the Lord hallelujah amen if that's what we going to do for 1,000 years we better get ready now amen we better kick out the slothfulness and all the laziness and all the excuses yes all the excuses amen praise the Lord oh my all the excuses we got to kick it out Hallelujah so like he said yes so to anoint not thy holy place but to anoint the most holy place and uh we notice that that New Jerusalem now you see here what what brother brandham is doing is to be able to give us an idea to be able to give us uh uh uh uh an interpretation of the scripture amen because when you actually look at it in sequence the New Jerusalem comes down after the Millennium so he's not giving us sequence here he's giving us interpretation he's trying to identify what is that most holy amen he called it a Most Holy place because the Bible called it the millennial Temple but then is also called the most holy because it's going to be a people yes praise the Lord amen it's going to be just like when Eve was taken out of idam Amen when Eve was taken out of Adam I mean uh uh when when when they went to worship she was not worshiping Adam both of them was worshiping Elohim right praise the Lord both of them was worshiping God are we together are you seeing the picture tonight amen amen so you see the reason why I took the woman washing Jesus feet and and and and and anointing him uh uh uh for our scripture reading tonight is to be able to to make us to see you know uh uh it's is uh uh uh just just in a place of a type like I said Jesus was entering into his pries to office because this is the way it was you read The Book of Leviticus reading from chapter 89 you go down you will realize that when when when the priests were called to their priesthood office there was a big basing amen and the priest would get in the Basin and he will be washed from head to toe he would be washed completely Aaron was the older brother of Moses but Moses was the prophet so Moses have to wash him right Moses have to wash he and his sons Moses have to anoint them Moses have to dress them and put them in the priesthood office praise the Lord amen that's the reason why no no no amount of theologic a man learn if you want to be in the fful ministry you got to be washed by a prophet right you got to be anointed and placed into the office are we together but that was the the the the original washing but then every time they come to sacrifice he does not need a complete body wash again he goes for a feet wash praise the Lord every time he comes over to the Tabernacle for sacrifice he goes for a feet wash and that was the same thing that Jesus was introducing to the New Testament Church when he took a tow and a basing and then he watched the disciples feet and then he said you do a one onto another amen we have our original watching amen we we we have been uh H Washed by the Water of the word amen amen when God called us praise the Lord out of sin he put us in the basing he washed us he set our mind on Christ but yeah when we come to service every time we need a feet wash yes he had to wash our feet to help us to walk right amen so it is it's not a whole body watch I mean the word the Holy Ghost is just going to pick up something and address a little bit thing in your life address a little bit thing in this person life you walk right this way say things this way approach things this way talk to things this way ask for forgiveness you know address these things he he it's it's it's a feet wash because when we come back for the next service again he's going to give us a the priest had to wash their feet before they step into the holiest of holy that's why Jesus says leave her she's doing this against my barrier praise the Lord hallelujah amen now so H H uh but yet here is that uh uh you know brother BR is bringing us to the place for us to be able to realize even though it's a it's a 70 week prophecy that concern the Jews amen but maiah the priest just like Moses got a gentile bride praise the Lord amen maiah the prince he's going to have a gentle bride are we together even though h h h the the the the scene looks ugly David had to send Urias out there for him to be killed and he took Bel Sheba but yet from theba will come a son called Solomon that will build a temple that will represent Jesus amen amen son of David upon his throne and that's supposed to be a fulfillment of the millennium are we together amen praise the Lord now so you see I say this and then I close uh uh the other night when we had the the the worship night with uh brother brother young I read a scripture there out of the book of uh uh uh Isaiah there and talking about the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness praise the Lord amen the G of praise for the spirit of heaviness because uh I mean that's that's what uh uh uh uh the that's what the melenia temple is all going to be about the Bible says it's going to be uh had I had another quote here but I didn't add it to my notes so they will not be able to project it for you but uh uh uh yeah that was so so much in myself I did not but when God set up the millenum uh uh uh Temple he will anoint the most holy net th holy but the most holy but when the king Take his strong for 1,000 years Glory she's she's over now the anointing of the most holy will be the last thing that will take place when the Tabernacle is erected the resurrection has come the Jews has returned Christ and his bride has come the Jews the 1,000 and uh uh one 144,000 are seal the millennium has taken place there will be an anointing when the most holy place will be Anointed The the holy the holiest of holy and the most holy the most holy place is the century where God live between the cherubin so you see you look at it and in your mind you think about a place but what God is actually talking about is you right praise the Lord amen what he's talking about is you are we together because the promise of the Millennium is their Christ and his bride will be just like Adam and Eve and we know that that Bride is a gentle bride that came out of all the church ages all the ones that stood for the word for their a for their day all the ones that were able to rise above all the Asim of their day all the Scandal and the things that were going on they were able to rise buff because as the enemy com in as a FL the spirit of of the Lord rais up a standard and these people were able to benefit from the standard that has been raising in their day to take a stand for God praise the Lord not enough to be a church member not enough to get our names on the book but to take a stand for God take a stand for the word are we together amen so he goes ahead he says uh uh uh uh uh uh the most holy plac is the center where God live between the cherubin and this time Christ will sit in the most holy place with their anointing upon him and and they will need no sun there for the lamb in the midst of the city shall be the light the sun will will never go down in that City praise the Lord and it would and it would never because Christ will be the light the anointed one and the King will come and take his throne for for 1,000 year to reain praise the Lord that is our future that is our future when you look at the word and look at the things that are happening in the word there is nothing here to live for the only reason why we are here is getting ourself ready for that place is getting ourself ready for that place what what what are you going to do with 1,000 years at least 1,000 years is determined for you you know that is 1,000 years right here it's Now setting how many years you going to spend here it's not setting praise the Lord amen amen the younger d just like they all are dying right praise the Lord and we don't know about which way we going to go what about illness or what about some kind of H H uh uh accident or whatever it is you think about it think about it the the the the the Saints in the First Ages think about it the woman ones that had to go through the the the lion Den the ones that had H the the MTI of Jesus Christ you know that that that they were thrown there to be to be killed by ly why they did that why they willingly surrounder because of that city right wow because they know that no matter how much time they stay here they will never live one day before God praise the Lord and if you take some of our ages into days we're not even we're not even uh h h p a minute yet our age is still beaten in seconds whether we will clock a minute or net we don't know it's only God that knows when are we waiting for when are we waiting for and what are we waiting for to really rise up to the m praise the Lord you don't have to think about that in the Millennium because it's 1,000 years that is determined for you you don't have to think about it praise the Lord and what you trying to think about what you going to do you'll never be able to figure it out so all you have to think about now is how can I get myself ready for that place amen praise the Lord that's what the brother bam says when the when the Old Testament SS when they preach about the Rapture they was expecting the Rapture in their day and time yes we that are alive and remain that's what they said they didn't say day that will come they were talking about it in their time and he says they die with that anticipation and it is the anticipation that will bring them off the grave they will rise up with of the Grave with that se he said just like just like Abraham looking for a city whose maker and Bild is God praise the Lord and when the dead resurrected after Jesus gave a loud loud cry brother says when he entered the S he say Sarah is this the city yeah no he will still in his journey he will still yet in his journey he was just passing through because that was just a type of of the city it was it was the natural Jerusalem he were just passing through because it was filled with hatred filled with smokers filled with drunkers and and all the evil that was not the city that God promised him a city who makeer and Builder is God it's a people it's a people that's what Jesus taught us Abraham was looking for the Physical City but when Jesus came he said you are that City on the hill and every city on the Hill has influence right every city on the hill has influence when you get in town that's the first thing you see is the one down in the slum nobody know if it's if it's there if you don't get in that area you don't even know if there is a slum you don't even know if there is a ghetto praise the Lord time is filling amen we seen all the different transition that is taking place on the earth things are changing so rapidly we must not be making decision decision should have been already made glory be to God hallelujah hallelujah amen and just like that woman prepared our lord for the next stage of his ministry there's a bride on the earth amen there's a bride on the earth if I can say in another way she knows that she's the melan temple amen you are a break in that Temple I'm a break in that Temple glory be to God hallelujah and she's preparing herself to be anointed and her and her anointing is not going to be an oil that will be pulled down her anointing is going to be just like Solomon Temple when the shakana glory the pillow of fire came down Elohim God stepped down in the building when everything was in place praise the Lord we're going to call these same bodies that we struggle in we're going to call it Out of the Dust amen that's what the bride is that's why the people of God they are under the influence of the Holy Ghost wanting more of God identifying their struggles putting it before God seeing appreciating what the grace of God is doing in their life is that just just uh uh uh joining Church making church there age have more Church than than any age have had we have more churches than any age have had pretty much every day of the week there is service going on somewhere every day of the week every day of the week praise the Lord salad is supposed to be resting the saans are there also they having their service so every day of the week church is going on somewhere but there's a people there's a bride that is placing herself into a millennium material she's putting herself into a temple material she want to be a Dwelling Place she want to be a habitation for God that's her desire she know the power is not in her hand she's not the Builder no God is the Builder but her desire praise the Lord she said Lord mold me I want to be a perfect break so I can fit my place and God has sent a word you have sent a word the message of the hour to anoint this bride that that is the thing that is capturing us that's the thing that is capturing us that is the thing that is inspiring us that is the thing that is opening our eyes right praise the Lord musician you can come let's
