TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and then finally at the hospital when the doctors was operated and giving no hope or not much hope of ever seen come through again then when he was at the end of his road then father's gra at him and the glory of the Lord came down on him in the room and he was just said just F in God's Beauty and when love has been projected then it's time for a Sovereign Grace to step in it'll do it every time you look the strange thing of how we human beings like to do things ourselves but we are children of God and many times we have to just take a seat and sit down till God comes around does it his way and notice a little child I was just sitting back there a few moments ago talking talking to a very fine medical doctor from Chicago who I had the privilege of having breakfast with this morning and we were speaking and he perhaps he knows this I'm sure does many times you have a little child and he gets on a little uh Timber tantrum we call it our home oh he's just sticking and squealing and going on he's go to tear up everything and go to hold his bread and usually a mother will come and shakeing and throw him up in the air and try to get him get his best I don't think this the case in history for whatever remember died he just has to run to the end of his road and then nature takes over that's the way with us Christians sometime we just have to run to the end of the road and let Grace take over we have to run all our theology out so God can really get the work you believe that and God does work in mysterious ways his wonders to perform now I've noticed this that each one of us as Sons and Daughters of God many times I have thought of Pentecost where said they were all in one place and one Accord now where there's Unity that was power and then if we only knew that each one of us in a um amateur way is a Creator uh we are sure that you understand that you see the little success that the Lord has given me as I'm to testifying this morning of success is because of this one thing that the patients that I'm praying for in the sick line I have to enter into their Fellowship of suffering with them and th reason I can't have a parine where you just run through like a bunch of sheep coming to a yard you've got to feel the the need of that individual standing before you if you don't you can't have the feeling of it like Paul rer once said said he was going to work one morning so he in his life had a little well of disagreement and he said as he started out he kiss his wife said bye she was crying but he always walked out the the G turned back and said bye she say goodbye so that morning when the same routine PassTime he said goodbye and she said goodbye said he went out the street and begin to think what if something would happened to me today or something happened to her that I know we never meet again in this Earth You got the thinking about it and said God begin to deal with you you ran back to the house real quick jerk open the door just standing behind the door still weeping said he never said one word to her but just pulled her around and kissed her again turn that back around went out went to gate turn back said goodbye but she said goodbye like she said the the difference was the last time there was a feeling in so that's the way it is there got to be a feeling there's got to be something that that's projected from you to meet the person you're talking to you meet the girl down in Mexico we were talking down there and on the platform there was an old man came to the platform who was Dr I looked down his old wrinkled seat and they were probably never had a pair of shoes dust all over the poor old man and he want to kneel down and take out his Rosary for prayer be and watch the sa raise him up and to this I said no need of doing that but when he put his arms around Bri I thought you know and my daddy would live just been about his age and here I am with a pair of shoes on I look down and it wasn't fit him or I to give him a Sho but to feel that whole man so de cry and then after all was that never maybe a good meal no clothes Harry to wear maybe life that had a lot of burdens but only a a man of like you would know then to be shut off and darkness where he couldn't see something inside him begin to bleed oh God that poor mortal a man like I am as a healing he loves eats drinks lives he a man and he's in this condition while praying for him put arms around him his old hands rain across my shoulder P I said heavenly father if this would make me feel to him like that what does it do to you in a few moments I heard him screaming and going on he receive his now what it is is love love e I I took a hold of her hand and he knelt down and his old patch shirt faded out and as I prayed just a little prayer I thought I seen the wrinkles in her forehead kind of frown Satan said to me of course you know that's just the real action of the muscles she's dead but as a continued to pray her hand gripped mine like that and Satan said again it's just the muscles but I just kept on praying in a few moments she raised up and she said who are you and her old husband so overcome by the bringing of life again to his sweet wife he threw his arms around her and begin to scream mother I slipped out the door of the ambulance and I said can you get me back to the platform and the man said there's 2,000 people between here and the door he said I'll take you around in the back of the parking lot and see if I can make the way in and just to show that God will respect those who hunger and thirst for righteousness when we got to where the line of the chartered buses was I heard a noise and I looked and it was a young colored girl nicely dressed in Arkansas in those days had strict segregation and she was blind and she was trying to find her way around calling for her papa I noticed her because she was kind of tall and she was saying oh papa where are you and feeling with her hands and saying won't somebody help me to find my papa well I Stood Still no one knew me because I'd just been in the temple all the time and they couldn't get near the place so I just stood there just a moment and I looked at her and she said somebody please help me find my papa nobody seemed to pay any attention to her and I was standing still watching her she come moving through the crowd not thought of old blind Anna in the temple that when she had prayed so long and waited for the consolation of Israel and when they brought our Lord into the temple to do for him after the custom of the law the Holy Spirit Led her through that crowd her being blind up to where he was was and I Stood Still and the young woman come moving on up and finally she staggered right into me she said pardon me and she started again and I said who are you looking for young lady she said sir I'm looking for my papa she said I we come over here from Memphis to see the Healer and said my papa was trying to find a way for me to get in and he told me to stand still but they pushed me out of the place and I've lost where I was standing and I'm blind and I can't find my way back would you be so kind she said to help me to the bus for my papa can find me now this seems like being a hypocrite but I said what did you say you come over here to see she said I come over to see the Healer she said you see sir I've been blind for years and she said I heard on the radio this morning of a man who got his sight and said Papa got the money ready and we got on the chartered bus and I come over to see him and now they say you can't even get near the building I said you don't believe in such stuff as that do you I said in the days when we've got such fine doctors she said but what you see sir they can't do me no good and I said you mean to tell me that you believe that the prayer of that man would do something for me or for you and she said like this I'll never forget it she said I'll tell you what I'll do if you'll just help me in where that man is then I'll find my papa what a rebuke to me I thought of blind Fanny Crosby she had heard of this other man being healed the other blind person and I thought of finy Crosby when she wrote pass me not oh gentle savior hear my humble will cry while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by thou the stream of all my comfort more than life to me whom have I on Earth beside thee or whom in heaven but thee while God is healing an angel's Temple he can heal in this Upper Room amen he's a God who healed that man on that wheelchair last night brought that with cancer off of the cop to rejoice when he couldn't even move the one who healed Little Ricky the one who sent the message all the way across the sea and spoke to that woman dying with diabetus and here sets her sister here this morning call back he's the same God now amen amen and I looked at her and I said to her I maybe I'm the one you're supposed to see see how God Lots things just exactly right why was I taken to the back she grabbed me by the lapels in my coat like that and she said are you the Healer I said no sister I am not I'm just your brother she said I want to see the Healer and I said I hope that you see him someday and I believe you will she said what is your name I said brother brandom she said you the one I want to see and I said now no one knows me I'll pray for you but don't let it be known take your hand and I couldn't pull her hand hand off of my lapel she was holding on for dear life Hallelujah and I said to her I can pray if you'll believe she said that's all I asked you to do and we bowed our heads and while we were praying I heard a scream and she ran out into the L throwing people one way or the other and she fell on the ground screaming I who was once blind can now see a few weeks ago I got a letter from her oh her eyes are 2020 she don't even have to wear glasses or nothing it's amazing grace of God that does these things it's something that Jesus Christ gave to his Church to enjoy the Privileges of good health I remember that night as we closed I might say this when the Lord give the ministry to me to go pray for his children as you all know I've been brought up in a poor home and that's the reason I'm uneducated and can't speak and so forth but I ask the Lord I don't want to be great I don't want to be popular I just want to be honest that's all I desire that you can know that I telling the truth because I represent him and when I started on the field to pray for the sick I I didn't have a suit to put on and I never taken an offering yet in my life and my brother CER boy at that time had been in an automobile accident and had cut his clothes all up and he gave me that old suit and uh trousers were torn pretty well and my wife went down to the 10 cent store and got some of them patches you iron on with the iron you know and she'd fixed up the trousers pretty well and the pocket was torn out and I got me a needle and thread and kind of whipped the pocket over you know patched it up sewed it and I'm not very good with the needle and I remember when they would introduce me to ministers such as we have here this morning I was kind of ashamed of the coat it is on the right side and that's I had to reach my right hand so I hold my hand sleeve down over that Tor and pocket and reach out my left hand to shake hands with the ministers and saying excuse my left hand but it's closer to my heart but the thing was that I was ashamed of that old torn pocket but when those people saw that young Ethiopian girl with her sight there stood an old man there with a club in a Twisted foot he said I know who you are brother brandham I've been standing here three days in this rain if you just ask God God will heal my foot what can be done at that time I said to him my brother if you believe that Jesus died and rose again the third day to make all these things possible hand me your club and when he handed the club he wasn't just kidding he meant it and I seen with my own two eyes that Twisted club foot come straight and he jumped into the air and begin to scream four men rushed around me but people mothers with their little babies trying to get in close to enough just to touch that old ragged coat and God was healing them it wasn't the Ragged goat no it wasn't the one that was wearing it it was the Lord Jesus that's here this morning hallah honoring their faith he leads us in mysterious ways because he loves us he makes it so simple until it goes over the head of the wise and prudent as he said it would and shall reveal himself to babes such as will learn I am sensitive enough of the Holy Spirit it to know now that there's many people that are suffering right here in this building and why not us just settle it now and accept what Jesus did for you all the same God was out there that night is the same God that's here right now and you have the same needs that they had and he is no respector of person the scriptures are true these things are done that it might vindicate that we're living in the last days in the shadow of the coming of the Lord as one speaker just said a while ago and being called in to the president to the cabinet and so forth to ask the question what can be done there's nothing can be done done just get ready to meet the Lord we have sinned away our day of Grace and there's only one thing left and that's the coming of the Lord and these signs and wonders that you see taking place are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
