TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning Saints if the video is showing right now what you should be seeing is at the front of the church I was giving a quick update on the work that weird we were gonna meet with a few of the brothers here on Saturday overdue to the conditions of the city right now we decided to hold off so instead we're just giving a little video update for everybody to see and then we'll go ahead and transition back into our regular Sundays go and finish the message we were listening to as we go through the video all this kind of walk you through what you're seeing and what's happening here as we go in I think we're still on the outside of the building so as soon as we get in here then we'll start showing you what you're seeing there's been quite a few changes we did our best in the measuring of the building without being able to course to enlarge the building in any way just rearrange our space to make it better here's the foyer area here what you're seeing is just not too much has changed directly in the foyer other than you're gonna see that the door opening there going into the sanctuary is going to be enlarged a little bit to make it a little bit easier for handicapped access or a larger wheelchair access if necessary the foyer changes are going to be that the walls are all getting repainted the trim is getting repainted and there is new LED lights going in the ceiling there we can see the bathrooms no changes are happening in the bathrooms themselves in either the men's or the women's other than the doors being repainted here's one of the changes you're seeing is that the nursery has changed a little bit we've shifted it over so brother ones office is that doorway to the right there and then the nursery is the doorway to the left we've removed that sink and cabinet unit that was in there and also that old tape library in order to give us some extra room and here I think we're gonna walk into the sanctuary you all bill to see and there we've removed both the office and the sound room the only thing that's going to be left is a little booth an audio-visual booth for the sound and audio-visual technicians that will be working in there which is going to give us approximately an additional 19 seats in the sanctuary which is actually about 30% more seating than what we had before which would give us a little bit extra room and it also should help us as we are dealing with the changes with coronavirus and having to space people out once we were able to get back to service here that's okay we have about a minute left on our video and just kind of panning around here we've also made some changes I don't know if you can see it but up in the front corners there there's some little box boxed out areas and look like pop outs and we're gonna use that to rerun all our audio-visual cabling so we don't have all that cabling on the floor anymore creating a trip hazard and this is facing back that the audiovisual booth you can see in the back instead of going all the way across with just a window which is a small booth little raised booth that allows us to get some additional seating in there as well and and just open it up and make it feel more open all the lighting in the sanctuary has been changed you can tell us a little bit cooler light it all went from all those old lighting commercial lighting to new LEDs we should also help in the winter with the flickering of lights and whatnot and I think that is about the end of the video so just so you guys can see what's happening and try and keep everyone up to speed and at this time we're going to go ahead and switch back over to the message for the morning god bless you or is it you mean your was that far I'm sorry alright number one come up here lady right which way

we at now we're at the end we're at the time where something has to be done said yes or no God's got to be found right or wrong today I preached two sermons hard trying to tell you what he is tell you your time is closing what he is what he was and now when we look tonight let's look at him now every person in the name of the Lord Jesus keep your seat now don't stir around set real still until your call let the little children now if I happen to say bow your head do it right quick honey cause evil things leave such as cancer and diseases and it goes out amongst the people and gets into others all that believe that and no it's the scripture say Amen we find in the Bible that evil spirits went from one to the other when this cast out and they try to find a place and how many times have we seen in the meeting people come to the meeting perfectly healthy and well set there and criticized and a day or two air that be found totally blind or strictly the cancer paralyzed the because they were unbelievers I'm not responsible for them only for the believers many of them went the institution many years ago and still there some went to their grave just because of being arrogant unbelieving there's no place for an unbeliever now it's a place for believers have faith in God Heavenly Father now the meeting is yours it's been yours all the time now I can speak on your word but now from now on I can't speak you're the one who speaks now Lord let it be knowing that your servant has told them the truth may people here may be many are here sick and won't even be in the prayer line but you're still here Lord you can heal out there just as you can heal anywhere let thy word be made known in Jesus name I pray amen now if I get your undivided attention for just a moment I want to look down this prayer I don't really believe I know one person are you in this prayer line all strangers to me you know what I don't know you raise up your hands if you are they are how many out there knows that I don't know about you raise up your hands out there see sure 95% of people here I don't that's true now here's a little woman I never seen her in my life she's a total stranger to me now she may be here for sickness she may be here maybe she's done something maybe she's here for finances maybe it's domestic trouble maybe she shared for someone else I don't know I have no idea but here is exactly a picture that's in Saint John the fourth chapter a man and a woman meets for the first time and no doubt that the young woman that met Jesus he was much older than her because he they said he looked to be 50 or over 50 and probably this young beautiful woman was out there at the well was just a young girl and here again tonight two people meet young and old without knowing one another and now she stands there they some reason she's there I don't go she might be staying there as a deceiver she might be stay there saying something when it isn't just see what will happen if it is you watch what happens now I don't know the lady I've never seen her she just held her hand a while ago I was a stranger to her and I hold my hand she's a stranger to me I never seen her well now if I just as a man I have to say lady what is the matter with you what are you doing here what do you want and she say mr. Branum I'm I'm here because I suffer with a cancer I suffer with TB I suffer with a tumor I'm out of money on my husband left me or I'm not married and my boyfriend did so she'd have to tell me well I'd say all right I'll pray for you lay my hands up on you and say Lord God give this woman what she wants hey man Jesus do it let her go away well I guess if she believed that she'd get well that's all right that's been a ministry for many many years but it was promised in the last days that as the angel God was dwelling in a human body they come up just before Sodom burned and he said with his back turned to the tent or Sarah lost and told Abraham what she was thinking in the tent God in a human flesh wearing human clothes and that's the only way God can do it today is when he gets in your flesh see showing that God would be manifested in human flesh Jesus said as it was at the days of Sodom so would it be at the coming of the Son of Man we have a messenger Billy Graham and them down there in Sodom but the elected church received a message and a messenger now if this little lady if the Holy Spirit will say he'll do it but if he would come and tell me what you're standing here for or what you won't or something you've done or something you're about to do well you know it'd have to come from some supernatural source cause we're just any here that would be right one then you'd know it had to come from a supernatural force if the Bible said that Jesus did that same thing and promised to do it again in the last days then you'd leave with him how many would be the same name then you'd see Jesus you'd see his word now you say you see the word the Bible says he is the word and the Bible said that the word discerns the thoughts that's in the heart is that right then it would be the word spoken to human lips discerning the thoughts nah I can't I have no way of doing it see cuz I don't know but he does and he is the word and he is the one that can take our two spirits like and woman at the well in him and blamed it then go away and show me just what she's here for what she's done or what she wants or something then I can speak it and say it that's up to her and I say brother brain can you heal her no no I can't do that he's already done it by stripes you were healed but that's just to raise her faith to let her know that if he knows what she has been and what she's wanting he knows he knows how to give it watch you will be at your words is that right now everybody believes it now be real River and you people out there now without prayer cards you pray now I remember Jesus passed through a group one day and a little woman touched His garment and he turned around said who touched me he looked all over the congregation till he found her and told her she had a blood issue and her blood stopped at that time see now the Bible said that he now is a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities is that right I'm looking at your brother weighs sitting here by his wife just recently that man was standing here while I was preaching just like Paul was preaching all night one night and this man dropped head right in the audience and the Holy Spirit brought him right back to life again he is a witness Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever how many numbers did see brother wait would like to see him raise up your hands never gonna see brother way would you stand up here's the man update about where he's sitting right now here's his wife a registered nurse standing right there he had no pulse going his eyes turned back to his black knees face heart attack doctor told me he had heart trouble before that I found on discernment not all go and told him and he had heart trouble and then all of us his heart stopped from down he went and there he was laying there perfectly gone that's about six or eight times that I've seen the Lord Jesus bring back the dead I've seen him do it and he can do it tonight now I take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of God in the name of Jesus Christ the irreverent watch I want to talk to you lady I've been preaching you seen just to catch your spirit that's exactly what I'm doing think there's something in you a life or you wouldn't be standing there you be it's a farm laying there and you'd have no life in you but bet there is a life in that flesh it controls you see and now even your thoughts and what you think the words you say and everything is what you live by the that's what you are is your words your thoughts and whatever you are now we are we are here believing now the Holy Spirit like Jesus told a woman bring me a drink and when she brought she said but you you shouldn't ask me that I'm a I'm a Samaritan you're you are a Jew we don't have no customs with each other no no wait words with each other now of course we are both Gentile and we're standing here just believing on God now if his spirit comes by me for a gift and can tell you what that you know whether it's right or not but you've lived that part of the line then then you have a gift to believe it and if you will believe it and he will tell you about it that's all over they will work on everyone here now everybody real rave room and ladies suffers with something wrong in her throat it's a throat condition that's right raise up your hand I've never seen her in my life that's right that's what she shared far for me to pray for her throat now right there as soon as I said that or just before she was she knew that there was something near something come near right then you can see the emotion of Honor a real sweet feeling like struck that light that you see in a picture or he had George that light that was in the picture is hanging right over the woman right now see it's another dimension she is a believer not a make-believe her she's a belief now beach you are a believer you believe me to be his servant I probably have to be to know that you believe you can tell you other things that's on your heart all right your something's on your heart is somebody you're praying for child you believe you can tell me what's wrong with it it's got a virus not right you believe God can tell me who you are you're Miss Walker you're not from here you're from the South Georgia you're going home well Jesus Christ your child so god bless you sir call [Music] now here's another one I don't nor never seen her she's just a woman standing there now though I've been preaching all together since about 8 o'clock is 10 now that's 2 hours I mean here that one discernment weaken me more than 2 hours of preaching that's see you said you mean to say that oh yes that woman who touched the hem of His garment he said I perceived that virtue has gone out of me strength is that right that's what it does now here's a woman that I have never seen Billy went over there if you notice something picked up that boy that we have here with us George he's a Baptist boy I want you to see that what we're talking about is God [Music] his father's family's a nice people there in Mexico missionary fine man and his father sick too I'm just waiting for him to come I just watched clothes charge now this lady I don't know her I never seen her I suppose we're strangers one another we don't know each other but now the Holy Spirit the sweetness of Jesus being present we're all witnessing that now if the Lord Jesus will reveal to me something about you now if I could heal you I do it but I can't do what he's already done the only thing if he was standing here tonight with this suit on it he gave me well he couldn't heal him because he's already done it by His stripes we were healed see but the only thing he would declare yourself by the word that he promised and make you see that he's the same yesterday today and forever and he promised to do it now if he will use me to tell you what you're here for would you use the faith that you have in him to believe that you receive what you have are here for with all your heart all right may the Lord grant it see the lady has something wrong or an examination shows it is a ruptured stomach that's true
