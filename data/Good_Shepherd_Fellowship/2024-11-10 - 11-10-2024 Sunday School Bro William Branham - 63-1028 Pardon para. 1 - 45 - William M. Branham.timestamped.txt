[4:54] we deem this such a great privilege to
[4:56] Stand Here among the saved
[5:00] and can sing this glorious old Hymn of
[5:03] the church Lord I
[5:06] believe to see the Faith of Our Father
[5:09] still living in the hearts of his
[5:11] children down Through the
[5:14] Ages and as the song has just told us we
[5:18] are on our way to canaan's
[5:20] land we pray father tonight if there be
[5:24] some here who has not made that decision
[5:28] yet that's not not come to the place
[5:31] that that they can just only believe the
[5:34] word I pray that this will be the night
[5:37] that they'll make that final say and
[5:42] accept Christ as Savior be filled with
[5:45] his Spirit we thank thee for this group
[5:49] that's called the Full Gospel

[5:54] for
[5:55] righteousness we're happy to know that

[7:15] Jesus name thy son
[7:17] amen be seated
[7:27] [Music]
[7:30] it's
[7:30] [Music]
[7:31] a one of the greatest times of my
[7:36] life is when I get to stand before
[7:39] people to speak
[7:41] about the joy of my life Jesus
[7:44] Christ what he means to me and then to
[7:48] have the privilege of sharing this Joy
[7:51] with someone else who has never had this
[7:56] Joy uh speaking the other day I'm used
[8:00] to be a boy preacher this is 33 years in
[8:02] the
[8:04] ministry and I lived upon the reputation
[8:07] of a boy
[8:09] preacher but now I passed that
[8:12] time and now I'm becoming the old
[8:16] preacher but each day he as a song said
[8:21] he grows still sweeter than he was the
[8:24] day before as I begin to cross over the
[8:28] halfway mark and looking towards the
[8:30] setting of The Sun Christ becomes more
[8:34] to me day by
[8:36] day and when I have these privileges
[8:39] stand before businessmen and women of
[8:43] the
[8:44] communities and to speak to them about
[8:47] something that means more to them than
[8:50] than anything in the
[8:52] world that is eternal life amen I do not
[8:57] think there's anything any greater
[9:00] and the that I could think of than
[9:03] eternal life when you're young you begin
[9:06] to think about well as a boy you're
[9:10] playing tops and a little girl is
[9:13] cutting paper dos after a while it's
[9:15] your education then or you go to marry
[9:18] the girl with brown eyes or blue and
[9:20] then the house is to be paid for the
[9:23] children's to be educated and where you
[9:26] at but I'm so glad that there's
[9:28] something that
[9:30] real after this is all over then you
[9:33] enter in to something that means more
[9:37] than these other things which they are
[9:39] they are essential certainly they are to
[9:42] who's going to be the mother of our and
[9:45] father of our children and our homes and
[9:48] so forth and the education of the
[9:49] children but even that all perishes it
[9:53] goes but life eternal is the greatest
[9:58] thing I know of it satisfied me when I
[10:01] was a young boy it satisfies me now
[10:04] while I'm a middle-aged man and I'm sure
[10:07] when the curtains are falling around my
[10:09] life I'll be happy to go meet the one
[10:11] that have spent my life
[10:13] for
[10:14] now to brother Tony the the president of
[10:19] the chapter here and I'm happy to be
[10:21] here with him in fellowship tonight with
[10:23] brother Carl Williams and other chapter
[10:26] uh Executives or Representatives and
[10:29] with all you visitors with us we're
[10:31] happy to be
[10:34] here one time I was speaking I believe
[10:37] was at Little Rock Arkansas in the robis
[10:40] Memorial
[10:42] Auditorium and there had been a
[10:45] man healed had been several years on
[10:48] crutches sitting on the street selling
[10:51] pencils and he could all just twist his
[10:54] limbs was paralyzed and get around
[10:56] people felt awfully sorry for him one
[10:59] night he come into the meeting and he
[11:02] got a prayer card and got into the line
[11:05] and was
[11:06] healed and the next day he had his
[11:09] crutches on his back walking up and down
[11:12] the street
[11:13] testifying and I was trying to speak and
[11:17] and uh after a while he raised up and he
[11:19] said uh brother brandom he said I'm kind
[11:22] of wit sins he said when I heard you
[11:27] speaking he said I thought thought you
[11:29] were a Nazarene that's what he was and
[11:32] he said and then I seen so many
[11:35] Pentecostals around he said somebody
[11:38] said you were
[11:39] Pentecostal and then I heard you say
[11:42] that you were a Baptist was Arin in the
[11:44] Baptist Church said I get it all mixed
[11:47] up what are you I said oh that's easy
[11:50] I'm a Pentecostal Nazarene
[11:53] [Music]
[11:55] Baptist
[11:58] together when I I come among the
[12:00] Pentecostal people a few years ago which
[12:03] the Lord sent me over when he are dained
[12:07] that I should pray for his sick
[12:09] children and the own denominational
[12:12] church that I was with at that time
[12:14] didn't believe much on praying for the
[12:17] sick or Divine Healing it was foreign to
[12:20] them they told me I'd become a Holy
[12:22] Roller and well maybe I have become a ho
[12:27] I don't know but I'm awful happy and
[12:29] whatever I am and someone said I'd lost
[12:33] my mind I said then just leave me alone
[12:35] because I'm more happier this way and it
[12:37] was the other way so I I just feel good
[12:40] this way and I it's been joy
[12:45] unspeakable but when I had come among
[12:47] the Pentecostal people I I thought there
[12:51] were only one group of them and then
[12:54] come to find out there just about as
[12:56] many groups cut away in them as it was
[12:58] in the Baptist Church that I came
[13:01] from then I wouldn't take sides with any
[13:05] groups I tried to stand between all of
[13:07] them and say we are brothers see and
[13:11] that's been my attitude ever since to
[13:13] see the great Church of the Living God
[13:16] United together in faith and prayer and
[13:20] effort and then when the Full Gospel
[13:23] businessman's uh set up their organism
[13:28] because they are not an organization
[13:30] they're an
[13:32] organism and that took in all groups and
[13:35] it gave me a place and they tuck me
[13:38] under their wing and I'm very grateful
[13:42] for the opportunity to speak for the
[13:44] Christian businessman because there I
[13:46] can express my belief among all the
[13:50] groups at the same
[13:51] time and it's been a great thing to me
[13:53] and I belong to one organization that's
[13:56] the Full Gospel businessman and to do
[13:59] that there's now in Africa where we are
[14:03] planning going right away down in South
[14:06] Africa where the lord gave us one of the
[14:07] greatest meetings that I suppose he ever
[14:10] did give us was down in South Africa
[14:13] where we saw 30,000 blanket natives
[14:16] received Christ as Savior in one
[14:18] afternoon service they registered 30,000
[14:22] the next morning while Sydney Smith the
[14:24] mayor of Durban called me on the phone
[14:26] which was with at the meeting we had
[14:28] some bought around 200,000 at the
[14:31] stadium or the dog or the
[14:33] racetrack and he said go to your window
[14:36] and look out the window and there came
[14:39] seven van loads and them great English
[14:41] trucks is practically almost across this
[14:44] room full of crutches and Wheelchairs
[14:47] and and things that the people had laid
[14:48] on the day before and they were walking
[14:52] behind the trucks singing with their
[14:55] hands in the air the song that you sang
[14:56] a few moments ago only believe all
[14:59] things are possible
[15:01] and I my heart I said Lord this will be
[15:06] a Memorial Day to me and the few days
[15:09] the day was only to be there three days
[15:11] and that's where I'm returning back
[15:13] again now and there are three days and I
[15:18] I just don't know what all taking place
[15:21] that come about by just one Miracle the
[15:24] Lord did at the platform give a a boy
[15:27] that was walking on his hands and feet
[15:29] like a dog restored him to his right
[15:32] mind and straightened him up before the
[15:35] people and the day before those people
[15:38] had to be fenced off because they were
[15:40] having tribal war and now they were at
[15:42] peace walking with their arms around
[15:45] each other singing only believe all
[15:47] things are possible I tell you the grand
[15:49] old gospel though in its Simplicity has
[15:52] never lost its power when it preached in
[15:54] the simpleness of the resurrection of
[15:57] Christ and uh it grows dearer to me each
[16:01] day and if you're a businessman here
[16:04] tonight and you haven't come into any
[16:07] businessman's Fellowship let me
[16:10] recommend this Full Gospel businessman
[16:12] you don't have to belong to any church
[16:14] or or every church that you're in It's
[16:17] Perfectly all right it has a title Full
[16:20] Gospel businessman but it don't have to
[16:23] be a full gospel man to do it Methodist
[16:26] Baptist Lutheran Presbyterians even
[16:28] Catholic priest whoever it is there you
[16:32] know I believe Jacob dug a well and the
[16:34] Philistines running away from it I
[16:36] believe he called it malice or something
[16:38] he dug another one they running away
[16:39] from that he called it strife and they
[16:41] dug the third one he said there's room
[16:43] for us all so I think that's what this
[16:45] is there's room for all of us here and
[16:49] we'd be glad to have you in this Tucson
[16:52] are you here to come in and fellowship
[16:55] with us and then don't forget the
[16:58] Phoenix meeting and now I know we're not
[17:01] supposed to uh give advertisement from
[17:04] the platform here because we made that a
[17:06] policy but being this is all connected
[17:08] with the Full Gospel businessman I'm to
[17:11] have prayer for the sick and preaching 4
[17:15] days prior the meeting at the remata
[17:18] this coming December January the
[17:22] 193r 19th to the 23rd four day I'll
[17:26] begin on the 19th is that right I begin
[17:28] on the 19 and then I have 4 days meeting
[17:32] and to you toon people next Sunday night
[17:35] I'm praying for the sick over the
[17:36] Assemblies of God grant way brother
[17:39] Arnold Max church if there's someone
[17:42] sick and like to come in I'll be
[17:44] speaking there the Lord willing next
[17:45] Sunday night praying for the sick and
[17:48] now may the blessings of God rest upon
[17:51] you and if you have your Bible I would
[17:54] like to get quickly to the word because
[17:56] I know many of you work tomorrow and uh
[18:00] will speak to you tonight from a
[18:02] scripture that I want to read out of the
[18:04] book of
[18:05] Romans Romans the 8th chapter and we
[18:09] want to begin at the 28th verse and read
[18:12] down the 32nd verse
[18:16] inclusive Romans
[18:20] 828 and we know that all things work
[18:24] together for good to them that love God
[18:27] to them who are called according to his
[18:31] purpose for whom he did for know he also
[18:35] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[18:39] image of his
[18:40] son that he might be the firstborn among
[18:44] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[18:47] predestinate them he also called and
[18:51] whom he called them he also
[18:54] Justified and to whom he justified them
[18:58] he also
[19:00] glorified what shall we then say to
[19:04] these things if God be for us who can be
[19:08] against us he that spared not his own
[19:12] son but delivered him up for us all how
[19:16] shall he not with him also freely give
[19:19] us all
[19:22] things may the Lord add His blessings to
[19:25] the reading of his
[19:27] word and
[19:29] now I want to speak on the subject of
[19:34] pardon the Bible said here tonight that
[19:37] he gave us all things well we certainly
[19:41] could not speak on all things but we
[19:45] will take one thing that he has given us
[19:48] and that is
[19:50] pardon and I think that's a glorious
[19:53] word to be
[19:55] pardoned because we are all guilty of
[19:59] sin we've all sinned and come short of
[20:02] the glory of God and God through his son
[20:05] has pardoned us from this guilt of
[20:08] iniquity and sin and a pardon reminds me
[20:13] of a story I read once of a in the
[20:16] Revolutionary War I believe it was that
[20:19] there was a man a soldier foot soldier
[20:24] that had did something that was the had
[20:29] found him guilty and he was sentenced to
[20:31] be shot I believe it was neglecting his
[20:33] poster Duty in time of
[20:36] battle and he um he was going to be uh
[20:39] killed by a firing
[20:42] squad and one fell felt so sorry for
[20:45] this man until he finally made his way
[20:48] to the uh the great President Lincoln
[20:53] lincol being a Christian gentleman they
[20:55] said he was riding up in his Carriage
[20:57] when the messenger met him and he fell
[21:00] up on his knees and said Mr
[21:02] Lincoln president of the United States
[21:05] kind
[21:06] sir he said I ask Mercy for one knowing
[21:11] that you are a Christian and know that
[21:14] you have tenderness in your heart for
[21:18] the weary he said my friend was at the
[21:22] post of Duty or where he was stationed
[21:24] but when the guns was roaring and the
[21:27] cannons firing he got scared and he left
[21:31] the post of Duty Mr Lincoln you didn't
[21:33] mean to do it he's a good man and now in
[21:37] a week from this day he must die by a
[21:40] firing squad there's no way to save him
[21:44] except you will sign his pardon Mr
[21:48] Lincoln with tears in his eyes pulled a
[21:50] piece of paper from his brief and wrote
[21:53] on there I Abraham Lincoln pardon this
[21:56] man of such shall not die and signed his
[21:59] name to it and the man gave him God's
[22:03] blessings and returned back to the
[22:05] prison and said to his friend I have
[22:08] your pardon and he pulled it out upon a
[22:12] piece of paper to show him and the man
[22:13] said don't mock me here I'm fixing to
[22:16] die and then come with such as that I do
[22:18] not believe it I just can't believe that
[22:21] isn't so any man could sign his name
[22:23] Abraham Ling he said but this is the
[22:25] president's
[22:27] signature said you are pardon and he
[22:30] turned his back and walked away and the
[22:33] man died under the firing squad and then
[22:38] here is a a a release from Abraham
[22:42] Lincoln the president of the United
[22:44] States to release this man and yet they
[22:47] shot him so it was tried in the federal
[22:50] courts and here was the
[22:52] decision a pardon is not a pardon unless
[22:56] it be accepted as a pardon Pard so this
[23:00] tonight that I read that God gives us
[23:03] all things and he gives us pardon it's
[23:06] pardon to those who want to accept God's
[23:09] word as pardon but it only just to read
[23:13] it it doesn't mean that you are pardon
[23:17] it means that you've got to accept it as
[23:20] your pardon that God gave his son to die
[23:25] in your stead and then it's a pardon
[23:29] released from guilt is what we wish to
[23:32] place on this a pardon from God is a
[23:35] release from guilt not the Turning Away
[23:39] by
[23:40] psychological doctrine of some sort that
[23:43] might in some way give you a little
[23:45] feeling that you have uh done what's
[23:49] right but joining church or taking up
[23:51] some Creed but it's a
[23:54] release from your guilt by the power of
[23:59] Calvary something has released you
[24:01] there's no more guilt the Bible says I
[24:05] believe in Romans 51 there is therefore
[24:08] now no
[24:09] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[24:13] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[24:15] after the spirit now a man when he is
[24:19] released from sin man or a woman there
[24:22] is no more desire in their heart to walk
[24:26] after the things of the world he is
[24:28] freely pardoned and becomes a new
[24:31] creature in Christ Jesus and his
[24:33] affections are set on the things that
[24:35] are above where Christ sits at the right
[24:38] hand of God he's freely released he
[24:41] doesn't have to uh have some priest to
[24:45] tell him or some minister to tell him he
[24:47] knows in himself that he is pardoned
[24:50] because he's as accepted up it upon the
[24:54] grounds that God sent it to him through
[24:57] Jesus Christ what a feeling it is to be
[25:00] free from
[25:02] sin I was told when the emancipation of
[25:05] the Proclamation was signed for the
[25:07] slaves in the South many years ago that
[25:11] the set time that they were free was it
[25:15] sunup on a certain morning and they all
[25:17] got out from the old plantation and many
[25:20] of the young men climbed way to the top
[25:22] of the mountain because they could see
[25:24] the sun uh come up first and then the
[25:28] older man a little beneath that and then
[25:30] the women and children at the bottom and
[25:32] they were waiting a long time before
[25:36] daylight called slave
[25:38] belts hard trials had marked their life
[25:42] with sorrow and they long for that day
[25:46] that when they know that they were
[25:48] pardon and the emancipation of
[25:51] proclamation said it this certain day at
[25:53] sunup they are free and they were
[25:56] longing to see that out when the sun
[25:59] come up so anxious till they climb the
[26:02] mountains oh if Sinners tonight could
[26:06] only be that
[26:08] anxious to know that you're pardoned
[26:11] you're pardoned the minute that you
[26:13] accept Jesus Christ as your
[26:16] savior then you are
[26:18] pardoned they said that the young man
[26:21] waited and as soon as the sun began to
[26:24] shine in the East they scream down to
[26:26] the older we are free and the older down
[26:30] to the women and children we are free we
[26:32] are free because the sun was up oh when
[26:37] man has sold out to sin and when the Son
[26:42] of God came up out of the Grave that
[26:44] morning for our
[26:46] justification I think it ought to be a
[26:48] scream across the Nations we are free
[26:51] from sin and shame freely
[26:55] pardoned by the bonds of cow
[27:00] no greater thing could be given to the
[27:03] human race when man sinned in the Garden
[27:08] of Eden he crossed a great Chasm
[27:10] separating himself from the Eternal one
[27:14] man at that time was eternal with God he
[27:18] had no sickness sorrow or death man was
[27:21] not made to
[27:23] die hell was not made for man hell was
[27:28] created for the devil and his angels and
[27:31] not for mankind because they were
[27:34] created on Earth to be Sons and
[27:36] Daughters of God but when man sinned and
[27:40] stepped across the boundary line between
[27:43] right and wrong he separated himself
[27:46] from God leaving himself no way back he
[27:50] was totally lost he could not come back
[27:55] because he had
[27:56] sinned but God rich in mer Mercy
[28:00] accepted a
[28:02] substitute because he had said the day
[28:05] you eat thereof that day you die God's
[28:09] justice and his Holiness uh
[28:12] requires death because it's his word and
[28:16] he must keep his word in order to be God
[28:19] and now the love that he had for the
[28:21] human race and yet had to see them
[28:24] separated from him and the fellowship
[28:26] that he had with his children children
[28:28] in the Garden of Eden and that
[28:30] heartbroken condition that he's had to
[28:32] be in all that time because his word
[28:36] said the day you eat thereof that day
[28:38] you die then we can rely upon this
[28:41] whatever God says is true it must come
[28:45] to pass God cannot take his word back
[28:49] see because he's infinite and he's
[28:52] Eternal and his first decision is
[28:55] alltime decision he doesn't have to to
[28:59] take it back because he learned more
[29:01] about it he's infinite to begin with and
[29:04] therefore When God says anything it's
[29:07] perfectly that way it can never be
[29:09] changed because it's the perfect
[29:11] decision and then the way God acts upon
[29:16] uh the subjects that accepts his
[29:18] decision it will forever act upon every
[29:22] subject that accepts his decision that
[29:24] way therefore if he made a way for a man
[29:27] to be saved
[29:28] the first way he made has ever remained
[29:32] the same way am and if God promised
[29:35] healing to the sick upon Faith to
[29:39] believe it it ever remains that way he
[29:42] cannot take it
[29:44] back he must ever remain the same way
