========================================

[Music] The sand. [Music] This is an old hymn. It's really a blessing. you enjoy this the words as much as I will enjoy singing. I sung this many decades ago. I just thought of it yesterday. [Music] The sanded in the foot [Music] of the stranger of Galore. [Music] And the voice that subdued the rough pillows will be heard in Judea no more. But the path of that lone with joy I will follow today. For the tolls of the road will seem nothing when I get to the end of the way. For the tolls of the road will seem nothing when I get to the end of the way. There are so many hills to climb upward. I often am longing for rest. But he who appoints me my pathway knows just what is needful and best. I know in his word he has promised his strength shall be be as my day. For the tall of the road will seem nothing when I get to the end of the way. For the tall of the road will seem nothing when I get to the end of the way. [Music] He loves me too well to forsake me or give me one trial too much. All his children have been dearly purchased. [Music] And Satan can never claim such. By and by I shall see him and praise him in the city of unending day. And the tall of the road will seem nothing when I get to the end of the way. And the top of the road will seem nothing when I get to the end of the way. When the last faithful step has been taken [Music] and the gates of that city appear. And the beautiful song of the angels float out on my listening ear. When all not all that now seems so mysterious will be bright and as clear as the day. The trolls of the road will be nothing. When I get to the end of the way, [Music] the to of the road will be nothing when I get to the end of the way. Thank you, Jesus. [Music] [Applause] Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Glory to your name Jesus. Amen. Thank God for that wonderful special tonight. Let's go ahead and stand as we drink the order of service will sing the last song. Hallelujah. [Music] From my mother's womb, you have chosen me. Love has called my name. I've been born again into a family. Your blood flows through my veins. [Music] I'm no longer slave to fear. [Music] I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. [Music] I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. You're a miserable me with a meloy. You surround me with a song of a deliverance from my eneies till all my fears are gone. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. From my mother's womb, you have chosen me. Lord, ask my name. I'll be born again. into your family. Your blood flows through my veins. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear.

Uh I saw the Lord high and lifted up. He was high and lifted up and his train filled the temple. Hope I'm The right right verse now [Music] saw the Lord. He was high and lifted up and his strength filled the temple. He was high and lifted up and his strength filled the temple. Angel cry holy. Angel cry holy. The angel cry holy is the Lord. I saw the Lord. I saw the Lord. He was high and lifted up and his strength filled the temple. He was high and lifted up and his strength the temple. The angels cry holy. The angels cry holy. The angels cry. Holy is the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Isaiah chapter 6 tonight. That's what I'm singing that song because that's what I'm reading from. Amen. Isaiah chapter 6 tonight. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Isaiah chapter 6 tonight. And u I prayed and hope that the service on Sunday was a blessing to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They turn the word upside down. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was their testimony. It can be yours also. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't have to turn the entire word. Just turn your room upside down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you turn the house upside down. Then you can turn the driveway and the lawn in order of there upside down. Amen. Praise the Lord. Isaiah chapter 6 tonight and uh uh our young uh technician Emmanuel having a birthday coming up. I think it's on Friday or sometime this week. Happy birthday, Emmanuel. And we thank the Lord for for uh the young. Amen. Isaiah chapter 6 let's uh uh remember many years back I think it was about 8 n years uh or so yeah around that time you know you you always be wanting to you want to be a missionary been talking to me about wanting to be a missionary. Uh when you are traveling, I want to travel with you. But I think as he's growing, he's growing out of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you will grow right into his position. &gt;&gt; So Isaiah chapter 6, let's read from there tonight. And trust that the Lord will will give uh blessing to the reading of his word. Amen. In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon his stronghold the temple. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And his train filled the temple. We sang this little song yesterday morning after we got before we prayed and the Lord just blessed us with his presence. &gt;&gt; And uh above it stool the saraphin. Now what I want us to pay attention to here is that the scripture says uh Isaiah saw the Lord sitting upon his throne that was in a vision. He was high and lifted up and his train filled the temple. Pay attention to that. His train filled the temp the temple above it. above his train. The saraphin each one has six wings. With twins they cover their face and with twins they cover their feet and with twins they did fly. And one cried unto another, that is the saraphim now crying on one onto another and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory." and the post of the door move at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke. Then sorry dr something cold that I was not supposed to do but it's okay then say I wo is me for I'm undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwed in the midst of a people of unclean lips. My eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts. Then flew one of the saraphene unto men, having a life coat in his hands, which he have taken with the thong from of the altar, and he lay it upon my mouth, and and said, Lo, this have touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is ped. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also I heard a voice of the Lord saying whom whom shall I send &gt;&gt; and who will go for us? Then I said here am I sent me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Here am I sent me. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat while you turn to Ephesians chapter 6. Why you turn to Ephesians chapter 6 tonight. Praise the Lord. I hope you all had a wonderful wonderful week going on for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I hope you all had have a wonderful week going on uh uh for you. So, Ephesians chapter 6 in my reading there. I said from verse one, but I won't read from verse one. I will read from verse 10. If you said verse 10, I said from verse 1 to 10, but it's from verse 10. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we rise not against flesh and blood, but against principality, against power, against rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil days and having done all to stand. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul is now coming to dress. Stand therefore having your your Leon's guilt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness. And then he goes on and then he goes on and and and and we you will see here when you when you count the the the the dress code of this uh Christian soldier uh uh uh Paul actually gave us seven of them. Seven of them. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So he gave us seven of them. Let's look at it together. And verse 14, uh uh you standing there for and your layers gide with truth. That's one. Your breastplate of righteousness, that's two. Your your your feet shs with the preparation of the gospel. That's three. Above all, take the shield of faith. That's four. Wherewith ye shall be able to quench the fairy dat of the wicked. Take the take the hermit of salvation. That's five. And the sword of the spirit which is the word of God. There are six. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The seventh is praying always. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praying always. Now, so tonight I want to I want to take a a little talk tonight that I call wash that seven. uh is is actually a quote. I just took that phrase from a quote that brother Brandon shared in uh souls that are in prison. He says this in in the message souls that are in prison. He says uh uh the seven is always a mystery. Wash that seven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the seven is always a mystery. Wash that seven. So when you see right here all the armor that Paul gave us, six of them are physical. The seven is a mystery. Praise the Lord. Because you don't put on prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't put on prayer. You put on the hair. You put on the the the shade of faith. You put on the breastplate and all of that, but you pray always without ceasing. Praise the Lord. Amen. So like like like he says here, he says the seven is always a mystery. Watch there seven. That's the finish. &gt;&gt; That was the coming of the Lord. Heaven was quiet, silent. Nobody moved. He's talking about the seven the seven seal. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm taking that little thought tonight. Watch that seven. That's what I want to go. But I'm that I'm I'm going to use that to be able to jump to something tonight. and uh and just trust that the Lord because what what actually I want to do tonight is that u like I said before, you remember when we talk about uh Moses telling the children of Israel that uh if uh if a man steal a sheep, he must restore it four times. &gt;&gt; And and and what we learn from there is that God deals with principles. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God deals with principles. You see, the reason why the law was given, it was not for us to keep it because nobody can keep the Lord. But God gave the Lord to be able to show our need for a savior. &gt;&gt; When you realize that you can't keep the Lord, then you found out that you have a need of a savior. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So you see there are a lot of principles the entire world that God created he created it with principles and until we until we understand the principles of God you will just be you will just be following the strength trying to keep this and trying to keep this and trying to do this and trying to evolve this because there are a lot of things I mean God could he could have created the entire world in one day. Why he used six days and the seven he rested &gt;&gt; is a principle. &gt;&gt; He put the principle of our redemption in creation. So when you understand God's principle, then you can be able to unlock the secret, you can be able to unlock the blessings of God. you can be able to unlock because lot of things that people look at from the Bible all they see is just rules don't do this don't do and done that's all they see but they don't see God's principle now so and that is the reason why uh uh uh uh God promised for the mysteries to be revealed in this day to be able to show us his principles. So, we're going to look at some tonight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. It's always a mystery, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. At the at the the the wedding of Ka, Jesus took six pot, you know, and told him to fill it. He told the woman uh the uh the word you have five husband the one you are with is now your husband that was the six. Where was the seven? &gt;&gt; The seven was a mystery. He was the seven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the seven. &gt;&gt; You look at the city of refuge. You go back there. You read it in in in uh uh in Exodus. Uh uh there you will find that there were six city of refuge. And yet Jesus will come and say, "Come unto me all you that labor and I will give you rest." &gt;&gt; So the seven is always a mystery. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, Brother Brandham in the message uh uh in the on the wings of a snow white dove, he talks about that vision concerning the problem he had in his stomach. &gt;&gt; You know, uh that stomach he had uh uh you know, in the vision, he swallowed that animal that was battering his stomach. It bothered him all of his life. But the Lord told him it was just six inches long. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Why? Six is six is the number of men. Six is a human number. Six is the number of time. Praise the Lord. And the seven will bring him his healing. &gt;&gt; So watch that seven. It's always a mystery. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. That's the reason why after every seven years we we experience a major change in our life that we don't even understand because it's a mystery. We we are breaking into a new age and new things happening all in our mind, our body, everything. That's not where I want to go tonight. But I just have to stir myself up. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just I just have to stir myself up tonight. So I will be going in in and out of uh wash the seven is always a mystery. Now this is the thing that caught my mind on this. That's the reason why I I'm saying this to you because as you read the word of God, as you read the message of the hour, uh uh I mean you can't know God by letters. &gt;&gt; God is known. The prophet of God said he's identified by what? his characteristics. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And one of God's characteristics is that he's the God of principle. &gt;&gt; You got to watch his principle. &gt;&gt; The moment you see it, it will never lie. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It will never lie. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the God of principle. Now, so on on on Sunday, uh uh time is not my friend yet. I have to run. Something I I really wanted to speak on tonight uh uh in bringing this to you, but I have to go through this for us to get there. And and what it is is that I was down in in uh uh uh Johannesburg this long long time that I that I I went away and I spoke on the subject and I I I I treated something and the Lord really blessed it in a way that I have not dealt with that subject before. And I and I thought after the service, I thought about it and I said, "Well, maybe when I get home, I will review it." I've spoken about it year before, but in the way that the Lord bless it, uh uh it was it was different. So, I want to see if I can be able to go in that direction. If we don't do it today, tonight, we will finish it on Sunday. So, but on Sunday when we when we spoke, we dealt with the the wars of Isaiah chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The wars of Isaiah chapter 5, which of course we we said that uh Isaiah were describing the the the the civilization that was supposed to come. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Woe unto them that build house upon house. war unto them that call good evil. War unto them that raise up early in the morning and go after strong drinks. I mean, he he just he's prophesying. He's dealing with the culture. He's dealing with the the the present destructive h civilization. But now, watch here. Now, if you go back to Isaiah chapter 5, uh we don't have all the time to run after it, but if you pay attention on Sunday and you count those walls, they were six. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you count the walls, they were six. Wo unto them that join house to house. One, war unto them that rise up early in the morning and go after strong drink. Two, woe unto them that drink iniquity. Three, woe unto them that call evil good. Four, woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes. Five, woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine. Six, where is the seven? It's always a mystery. The seven will come in the next chapter. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Whoa, it's me." &gt;&gt; That was the thing that just It just it it it just blew my mind. &gt;&gt; It just it just threw me. I mean, it it threw me against the wall. &gt;&gt; I I said, "Oh my god." &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; A principle of redemption is right before my eyes. So I then went back and and and and I' I've listened to brother brand message I think just few days a couple of uh last week on his presence because he preached that message in September. So I I had to go back again. There was some things I so I had to go back and listen to it again just to be able to pick up some few things. But that's where I want us to go tonight. That's what that's what I want to grab your attention tonight. We're not just coming to church just to be in church people. We are not just coming to church just to play religion. God is releasing his his his presence, his being to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's he's releasing himself to us. And if there is ever a time that we need &gt;&gt; h God as a person is right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. right now with all the craziness that is that is that is going on in the world and especially in this nation with with all the the the the the religious things that is going on. I mean we we have to prepare ourself. &gt;&gt; We have to get a hold of God. &gt;&gt; We have a promise one of these days this church these churches those will be shut. I was just thinking about that when when uh when uh when I started showing to you in a scripture that churches begins from home. That was one of the thing that was in my mind. I wanted to go down that route. It begin uh uh in homes. It will end in homes because when the church's doors are shut, we will have to meet at homes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because now unless you are preaching the revealed word, unless you are preaching Jesus Christ, you are so tempted to say something and you might be misunderstood by people on the on on on the internet and then pretty soon before you know they start running to your church to to put you in in in in handcuffs because I mean the whole society now is just so polarized. &gt;&gt; Yeah. with everything that is happening. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You could say something and not even trying to go in the way of politics or what is happening and and and and somebody will just misunderstand you and and then blow blow you on on on YouTube and make you saying that thing over and over and over and everybody that hear it don't even know you, they will start to hate you and and where is that place? Let's go down to that church and and all of that there. But that's not what I'm talking tonight. &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to show you tonight is that watch that seven &gt;&gt; is always a mystery. Even in your life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Even in your life. &gt;&gt; The things that God will do, the things he will allow, &gt;&gt; wash that ser &gt;&gt; because if you can wash it and grab it, you get the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be in the midst of it. If you don't see it, it does not mean anything to you. &gt;&gt; Watch that. Seven is always a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. So that's the thing that caught my mind here. Sis Walls as I spoke about uh uh uh talking about the the the you know the the the society the cosmos uh and and and you know the word because we what we were talking about is turn they turn the word upside down. So we were looking at cosmo. We were trying to see how that the world was already upside down. These guys were just trying to bring it back to where it's supposed to be the way that God wanted it to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so we were looking at that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh but just just just thinking on that, just meditating on that. Then uh it got to the place where my mind I was just I was just reading this and and I says, "Oh my god, I've not seen this." I read this. I preach preach uh message after message from here. I've not seen this until a couple of days when the Lord just u now so that's what I want to go tonight you know that's what I want to go tonight that's exactly where I want to go tonight this is a prayer meeting I will take the message uh uh the great commission I'll take the message the great commission let's let's go quickly if I have found grace in your sight listen now if I have found grace in your sight through God you take My word for this brethren, if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing, when a man has done you wrong and he's absolutely justly, I mean, he has done you wrong and you know, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I was just thinking I was just thinking uh uh you know I was just thinking about what I just said uh and and what what was running to my mind is that it is always in a time of crisis you know when people start feeling you know the need of crisis that's when they start running to God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I mean uh the churches will soon start getting fooled again because people will uh uh you know somebody says uh when is is is is having trouble that's when man runs to the moon. The moon is a type of the church. So let's let's go ahead here. The prophet of God says if I have found grace in your sight through God you take my word for this. If a man if a person if you if you want a blessing and get a blessing when when a person has done you wrong and he's absolutely wrong. I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong. He's done you evil. Don't mention that. You take him to prayer before God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said take my word for this. If I if I mean anything to you, praise the Lord. I mean this this is just a a humble simple way to say if you consider me &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; to be anything to you, &gt;&gt; take my word for this. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There there is there's something he say here. That's what I want to come to. He says if a man has done you wrong, don't mention that you take him to prayer before God. That is one of the difficult things to do. That is one of the difficult things to do. It's It's not him to do it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; No, it's not him. God has to get a hold of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you to do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not him to do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I also show you where it is now. Himmon, Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says uh and don't take it in a way of just a selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our father where the prayer should be made in his presence and say father yes my brother or yes my sister he's justly. He deserved punishment because he has done me evil and I don't see why he did it. Then let God go to talking to you. Allow God to talk to you. Now that's that's why I say is this thing is not human because the problem there is that many times when we say we feel sorry for people it is not it is not in a place of us having compassion. It is in a place of us having sympathy. &gt;&gt; Now we've been taught compassion is the will of God. &gt;&gt; So if you approach it this way you will be having compassion on that person. &gt;&gt; Right? Praise the Lord. Because most of the time when we when we when we say that we we feel sorry for a person, the way our mind channel been feeling sorry for a person is that is uh uh you know I I just wish that God would whip that person back. I just wish that God would really give it back to him 10 times that he did. That's the way we feel sorry for the person. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together now? So he says here and uh standing should stand in the present God our father. The way the prayer should be made say father yes my brother he's just he deserve to be punished. He's done me wrong. I don't see why he did it. Then let go talking to you and you will see maybe we have read this before. We'll see. you will see maybe what that man has been through. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now that's when you are coming to the place of having compassion for him because now you are beginning to step in his shoes. Now you are beginning to think, "Oh my God, how the devil is trying to destroy this man, brother." You are no longer thinking about what he did to you, but you are thinking of how God is how the devil is about to destroy this man life and Satan purpose for this person is to send them to hell. You start getting so mad with the devil. You're not even thinking about what the person has done because now you are getting so mad that the devil has blind this guy. He can see that Satan is is is using him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Then let God go talking to you and you will see maybe what that man has been through. The devil has twist him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong. Before you leave the throne of God, you will feel sorry for that man. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will be sympathizing for that brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You'll be stepping in his shoes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "And and and and when you get back down to work ever again, when you come out of prayer, when you come from out of prayer, which mean you have already broke the barrier of of of of getting over your frustration, you have broke the barriers of getting over all the thoughts that is going through your mind. You have broke the barrier of getting all over your emotions that you don't even know where you are. You're so lost in the spirit. You are so mad with the devil and I mean you are just reing it down on Satan. You are a beast. You are a serpent. You are cursed from the beginning. I rebuke you. I mean you you are so much on the devil when you get back down to earth. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you will go over to that brother and shake his hands cuz you know what he has been through. you understand that it is just the devil that has messed this guy mind up. The devil has just messed this person up and that they are they they are just they are just filled with uh with with person stuff from the devil in their mind in their spirit. I mean when you open their mouth you can just smell the breath of Satan. cuz you know what he has been through. You can't stand with a mortar in the presence of God and condemn anybody. &gt;&gt; I don't believe no sir. Even if he is a rank sinner, &gt;&gt; you ever get into God's presence, &gt;&gt; we're coming into his presence now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was where Isaiah got in chapter five. He could see the evil that was in the word. You know, word unto them that is doing rise up early. Woe unto them that is wise in their eyes. Woe unto them that are drunk. Wo unto them that are that are immoral. Woe unto them that are abominable. He could see all of that. But when he came into the presence of God, &gt;&gt; when he came into the presence of God, &gt;&gt; and he stepped beyond his mind, beyond his emotion, &gt;&gt; he couldn't see the destruction of the city or the pollution of the city, he could only see himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; He could only see himself and his need for God. &gt;&gt; When he's out there, he was seen uh the world is evil. He's righteous. But when he gets in the presence of God, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He see his need &gt;&gt; for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if he's a ranked sinner, you can't stand with any mortar in the presence of God and condemn them. How it's so easy for us to to uh forget these things. You know, we can we can forget forget about it. When we when we say we forget about something, we we pack it nicely and forget about it. You pack it and keep it to the place where nobody will touch it. When you're ready, you go pick it up again. Praise the Lord. Watch that seven. &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery. &gt;&gt; When when Isaiah broke into that principle, it changed his life forever. &gt;&gt; When he broke into that principle, it changed his life forever. His life was not the same. Read Isaiah 1:5. And after chapter 6, read the rest of Isaiah. It's completely different. his ministry changed the things that he begin to see right in chapter 7 he saw 700 years telling Ahaz I gave you a sign ask God for the sign he said no I can't ask God he said is there anything too hard for the Lord asking for the sign behold a virgin shall conceive let me tell you now let me give you a sign if God will make a virgin to conceive &gt;&gt; it changes life it change his ministry. He was no longer looking at the filthiness around him. He was break into a vision, looking at the promise, looking at the millennium, Isaiah 53. He was looking at Calvary. I mean, he was he has he has gone. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he broke into a he broke into a principle of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our sight is is uh all we can see is as far as our nose. That's why we quick to condemn. That's why we quick to criticize because it's just right our nose. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wanted to say something, but I should just keep it. Go ahead with this. No. So, that's that's what is bringing us to the subject. Now, I'm not going into the mysteries or nothing like that, but I just took this because it's a principle that never fail. It never fail. You can take it all through the scripture. It never fail. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; When Ruth took the courage and broke into the field of &gt;&gt; Bo. when she took the courage and Moab Gil took the courage to break into the field that field the field of the harvest was was gathering with men that have drunk and they were drunk. They have drank all night. They are rejoicing over the harvest. It was a place for only boys. girls were not invited. But she took the courage. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because she wanted something from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She brave herself to sneak that nobody will see her. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How will she be able to identify Boas among all these drunky men? She had to be tipping over her toe, dashing down and and and you know, holding her breath so nobody can hear her breathing even when the guys came closer. But then when she got there and she was able to find Boas, she cover herself with his skirt. I'm going to get to that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; She used his skirt at the end of uh of and and she just cover herself. &gt;&gt; When Boaz realized, Amen. he got a a feeling a stranger is in my tent. The Bible says he commanded his men to give her six val. &gt;&gt; He gave her six. One, two, three, six. It's because the seven was a mystery. &gt;&gt; The seven was himself. &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. It never failed. &gt;&gt; The seven was himself. &gt;&gt; He knew that it was time to redeem this woman. &gt;&gt; She needed redemption. Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; watch the seven. It never fail. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, yes. Yes. Isaiah here. Isaiah, he's he's breaking into this place here where the uh uh uh uh you know uh can use the ad. He go got it into the temple. And I mean this guy pouring out his heart before God. He don't even know where to begin from. But he got a principle from God. Not even having the revelation of this thing. And then he never even knew the seven. He didn't even know that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But he stepped right into it. He stepped right into it. Praise the Lord. And sometimes that is the way with our life. You can walk right into the into the seven seals and don't even know it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But because you have stepped into it, God is going to bless you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You are stepped into a place with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says right there that uh uh uh where is this guy name? Kenas. Coena was just doing what he was doing but he did it one more time and God says your arm has reached up to me. &gt;&gt; He was just doing what he was doing. He was not publicizing it on Facebook or going on on on YouTube or Instagram, nothing. He was just doing the Bible says he was a man that gave arms. But there was one more time he did it. &gt;&gt; An angel came down. &gt;&gt; And say, "Your arms has reached out." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; One more time he did it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He broke into a seven seal. Whenever you get into the presence of angels, &gt;&gt; glory, &gt;&gt; you are in the seven seats. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery. It's always a mystery. &gt;&gt; Now, so we see here, you know, he he gets to that place and and and he says, "Lord, woe is me. I'm a man or dumb. You just watch that. He did not He did not talk about the president. He didn't talk about the king and say, "Oh, Uzia." He didn't talk nothing. &gt;&gt; It was him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was him that Lord, this is my time. &gt;&gt; I'm the one in need of prayer. I'm the one that need to be changed. I'm the one that needs help. &gt;&gt; I'm the one that needs deliverance. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that God, one of the angels took a coat of fire &gt;&gt; from off the altar. &gt;&gt; Come and touch his lip. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say your lip is clean and your iniquity are forgiven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It changed his life. It was almost like Jesus saying to that woman, go and sin no more. It was not a commandment. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was an instruction. It's two different things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he has taken the sin desire out of her and said, "God, even if you try, you will never sin again." &gt;&gt; It was not an instruction &gt;&gt; or a commandment. He was instructing her. &gt;&gt; Something has happened to you. &gt;&gt; When I wrote it on the ground, I wrote everything that was in you on the ground. I raised it. God, even if you try, you will never. &gt;&gt; Since I gave you water, you never come back to this place again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; She thought it was just a casual conversation, but that word was a word of eternal life. It was a word that could go through her body and change her desire. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The very people she was ashamed to run and walk before she went all in the city. Come and see the man that told me the things that I've done. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was power in the word to change her life that very moment. &gt;&gt; She didn't need to go through all your seven step and 12 steps. Now see what brother Brandon was saying here. I'll leave the rest with you. Amen. See what he was saying. He says uh in Revelation chapter 4 uh uh uh uh uh uh throne of mercy message. He says, "Now listen, in a year that Yuzia, King Yuzia died, I I saw also the Lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple glory." What? His train. There it is. What is his stream? He says angels &gt;&gt; being his tree that follow him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So there were two sets of angels. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's what I wanted you to pay attention to. &gt;&gt; Because the trains were not the saraphins. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; the train was the cherubim. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not the saraphins. See what he was says here. He says uh uh uh uh his train. There it is. Angels being his train that follow him. The the train the train's what come behind. &gt;&gt; Okay. The train is what come behind. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Train is what come behind. His train filled the temple. Now watch the what he says. And above it stole the seraphim and each of them had six wings. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this was the complete throne of God because the servants are the one that are responsible for prayers and praises. &gt;&gt; But the train is the god to the throne. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We you we will go on a little bit here and see and see what he says here in the message influence of another. He said, "Notice, Asa know that he must find something different." So what he did? What did he do? He went to the temple. He uh he raised up his hands and he cried to God and he fell into a vision. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You people that don't like crying, I don't know how how it's going to happen to you. &gt;&gt; You know, he cried to God. He fell in the vision. And as he fell into the vision, he saw God not on a thrown down year, but lifted up way up. Oh my. His train was following him and and lifted up into &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Wednesday night. It's almost 5 minutes to 9:00. Don't get me to stop preaching now. Amen. Don't &gt;&gt; get me to stop preaching. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm just feeling so good tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His train that follow him and and and and lifted up into heavens and he saw back and forth through the temple saraphine flying. And so what brother Brandham is alluding here told is that is that Isaiah was caught up into the constellation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's why he's illoney yet when he sees this he says yeah uh uh uh where am I praise the lord &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; follow him lifted up in and he saw back and for through the temple saraphin frying oh mine saraphin it means burner the word saraphim means burner uh uh which is next to the altar actually the saraphins is the one who received the sacrifice and cleanses the wor the the worshippers and then present him to God. The saraphene does that. Now this saraphene was angelic being and they are very next one to God right at the altar. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God and and God want to bring every one of us into that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This the the the woman had the word she never she never calculated. &gt;&gt; She never calculated because it is it is God unwritten principle. The same reason why God had to work six day and rest seven. That very same reason. the same reason why he had to do that wrongs all the time. That's is the same reason why uh uh he allowed six men in the in that woman's life and then at the seventh he came on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the same reason why he allowed Boaz under inspiration gave her six B load because the next day Boaz is going to redeem her. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; these are divine principles. &gt;&gt; They are divine principles. We said all of these things, we hear them, they become so common to us. That's what brother B is saying here. If you consider me to be anything, take this from me. Praise the Lord. Now, so we see here uh uh we see yet I mean I've I've already uh uh gone through my time here and uh uh let's let's let's just see if we can we can be able to to uh do something here before we we go home. And uh really what I wanted to bring to you is is that principle so you can see it is is for you so so you can be aware of it. So you can be aware of it. If you listen to the message the wings of the snow white door brother even experienced that God gave him that vision of that animal many years back. But just at the time where his healing would come, God brought the vision back to his mind. He said, remember in the vision, it was only 6 in long. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And no matter what we go through in this life is just 6 in long. Praise the Lord. That's God's measurement. You might think your trial is just 6 in. It it have to be in human time. It never goes beyond human time. It never goes beyond him time. God's that God's length to be able to to to measure your sickness, measure your sorrow, measure your pain is just 6 in long. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is the reason why we have a 6,000 years time spent on earth. The seven is a mystery, a millennium. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The seven is a millennium. It's a principle. You have to see it. You have to believe it. You know, because sometimes what what happened to us is that we we we get to this place where we we we get we get to to to to soon, you know, running our mind, exercising our mind. So what happened is that uh you start to think okay it's it's uh it's three years I've been going through this now. &gt;&gt; So you counting for for seven years that's your time. That's not God's time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Maybe in God's time you have you are just at the end of your six. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The thing about it there is that he don't want to work on your calendar. He want you to believe &gt;&gt; that this is his principle. &gt;&gt; And if you believe that God is your internal principle. &gt;&gt; So it gave you faith to know that when the seventh comes, you will break into the mystery. &gt;&gt; You will understand the mystery of your trials. you will understand the mystery of your pain. &gt;&gt; Don't put God on your watch or put him on your calendar. &gt;&gt; You are just giving the devil room to mess your mind up because now you finish counting seven. Nothing happened. &gt;&gt; I told I thought the seven is a mystery. My own servant is dark. &gt;&gt; It's because you are on your you are you are on your time. You're not on God's time. &gt;&gt; Maybe to God you just maybe to God you have not even started yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's a principle. &gt;&gt; It's not a time principle. It's a divine principle. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's almost like when Moses said, you know, uh uh uh uh uh when when you when you when you catch the man that that steal uh uh uh a sheep, you can't catch him. You can't catch him. There is no way you can catch you can't catch the devil. No, you can't catch him. This guy is sneaky. Praise the Lord. There is one that can catch him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. There is one that can catch you because we go through those exercise. Oh, you know I I I grabbed the devil. You have to restore. The Bible say you will restore res. &gt;&gt; It's a divine principle. And what God want you to do is to believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is to believe it &gt;&gt; that Lord you gave these principles for us for our benefit and as I see it in your word is playing out in your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many servants came to Job? The Bible says the first one come say your children are done. The second one come how many? Count it four. So right in there, a principle of restoration, &gt;&gt; a seed of restoration was already sown. &gt;&gt; Are we are we together? &gt;&gt; But then how many years did it take take God to to to to redeem Job? 14 years. But the principle will never fail. It will never fail. &gt;&gt; God say I will restore all that the pa want the the kanga want the caterpillar the locust. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When it goes through those four stages I will restore. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you go through justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost himself, I will restore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is not restoring your physical body. David said, "Restore my soul." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you go through those experience, then God is bringing consciousness to your soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; You start to walk with God from the rim of your soul, not your mind, not your eyes, &gt;&gt; now your environment, &gt;&gt; your soul has stepped up in the place. &gt;&gt; But the Bible say in walk with God. It was not a physical feat. No, he have got into a realm where he started believing God. &gt;&gt; He could walk with God into the future. That's the reason why he could prophesy &gt;&gt; and talk about the judgment in the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's late tonight. &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My work is just to just to be able to to arm you, give you things for you to use. I don't know how to entertain. Amen. Because I'm not just a funny guy. But I just come up with all of these little message by the by, you know, by the the the, you know, the the inspiration of the Holy Ghost just to, you know, uh uh uh just to be able to encourage you. Praise the Lord. Love the Lord tonight. Are we grateful &gt;&gt; that God say watch that seven? You know the thing about it then is that it is God that is watching your seven. He's watching when you come into the seven when you will come into the seventh cycle. Pray for me. Just hold this thought. We will go we will go there on Sunday because where I want to get to here is is to is to just show you uh the benefit of what what God has given to us in this last day. [Music] Let's bow our heads and pray. Heavenly Father, the hour is late. Lord, the hour is late. More than 50 years. More than 50 years going on Lord God to 50 plus stay counting since your servant the prophet left God. Your word has been here. We have made doctrine out of it. We have made forces division. But Lord these were divine principles. that you give to us for this hour that we are living in. That's why your prophet would tell us over and over, you never ask us to understand. You ask us to believe. When we see a principle and we see what you have done in your word, let's believe that that same God, that same God that could change Sarah body. That same God is here tonight. That same God that could come down in the furnace fire that the burning flame will not even burn the clothes on those Hebrew boys that same God is here tonight. If we see those things, they are not just Bible stories. They are reality. raise our faith, Lord. Let's get away from all this uh religious spirit and church playing. Let's let's go in just like Isaiah. Getting away, Father, from uh uh uh just learning how to criticize and just gossiping and and and and fussing and and just going into that chamber and say, "Wo is me, Lord. [Music] I'm a man of unclean lips. [Music] and the manifold cleanings. [Music] Father, you know how long we will have to be here. You know exactly the meaning, the second to the rapture. Father, you know the the exact time, oh God, where we will step into our servant, where we will step into our mystery. You know, Father, Lord, that exact moment, it does not come, it's not by power or by might. It does not come by our hard work. It does not come by our smartness. It comes by our surrounding to you. It comes. I believe Asia went to the temple that day frustrated. His good friend is dead. He don't know what to do. But he realized that he needed you. He needed something to change. He can't continue this way. [Music] Father, you know all Lord God that will become of this uh local assembly. We can we are doing the best that we know how to do Father to be able to encourage your people to be able to lead them Lord. Father, [Music] we're looking forward to God. Father, Lord God, we are watching that seven. It's a mystery. I don't know how many I don't know the number where we are. I can only wish that Lord Father, we are in the number of grace. I can only wish that Lord God this assembly has gone through deliverance. Father, maybe we are in the six Lord with all our human errors and failures just playing around us Lord and and we are becoming not very concerned. [Music] But when the seventh come on the scene, it's a mystery. You brought it for every man in the Bible. You brought it for the woman at the word. You brought it Lord God for now for for Ruth and now me. You're going to bring it for us. Lord, [Music] I pray that God you bless us Lord. Bless your children. Oh father God as we as we go home and the rest of the week, everything we be going about to do. I pray that God you will keep each and every one of us. Oh, Father, bless your people in their home. Lord if there is any house of God father that is struggling Lord God we pray that oh father God may it be lifted up Lord God out of whatever Lord Jesus [Music] bring us to that place in our prayer life oh God our commitment our devotion to you I pray Lord Jesus Father, we ask for strength, Lord. We ask for strength, oh God. And all you bring us to that place, Lord Jesus, where all our childishness and foolishness will be gone away. And pretty soon we will know that, Father God, it is for this reason you have us to be here. We love you tonight. We love you tonight. Father, I wish that Lord, I know that God, Father, your children know. Lord God, we don't come here to play games. Lord, we come so you can make yourself known to us. We want to break into something. Lord, the prophet said the dynamics of this church will be the outpouring of the Holy Ghost. Oh, give it to us, Father. Give it to us when the young people will experience the Holy Ghost. Lord, our little children, Father God, something that would just be so real to them. Oh God, we love you tonight. We love you tonight, Father. We love you tonight. Oh, we love you tonight, sweet Jesus. We love you tonight. come and go with us now, Lord. Father, those that are traveling, Father, Lord, carry us safely. Bless the rest of the week until we meet Sunday morning. Watch between every one of us, Lord. Bless the little ones, Lord, the babies. We love you. We thank you tonight. Thank you father in Jesus name we pray. Let's stand to our feet. Spirit of God move. Write your word in my heart. Fill my hope. [Music] Lord consume my life. Spirit of God and I want to be so that you can come and feel me. Oh spirit of God. Oh yes. Write your word on my heart. Feel my whole being so my life. Oh spirit of God. Oh, I
