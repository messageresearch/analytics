========================================
[Music] [Music] I got into [Music] something uh I want to thank the Lord real well for undertaking for brother caps' boy it um just so happened and this is a little time that I come back to Indiana know they're not recording this I suppose we're not and so then don't see nobody in there so they I come back go squirrel H and so U I guess Charlie's is going to have to put up with me him and Nelly and I'm down in Kentucky now for a day or two to squirrel hunt so uh i' rather miss anything any other kind of recreation than come here on about the middle of August and go squirrel hunting with Charlie Banks and all of them it's kind of a traditional thing with me and so um I took Joel when we was here the other time everybody got sick Chang from that real hot climate down to this to this cool cool climbat you got here I know you think this is not cool but you come out to Arizona once it's 109 the shade when I left the other morning and then around midnight in the night when the cool air come down off the mountain it's still 96 see that's at midnight when the cool air was coming down and so it's that place is all right in the winter time but it's for scorpions and lizards in the summertime not human beings even all the animals take off for the mountains they just can't can't stand it and I'd been out to shoot my little rifle in uh somehow I just want to tell you about the little caps boy and I said and Joel I just have to give him the rifle cuz he cannot shoot me we got it shot in and I I driving tax 50 yards and I said to to Joel Joel said Daddy I believe I can do that poor little fell that had a headache I've been praying for him a high fever he went out the range with me uh any uh 2 over 10 boore and a 22 R flip crosses its line of fire at 25 yards is then again at 50 just the same if it's 2 over 10 so then um and I shot it in 25 yards and so I had two more tax and I put of you if Joe didn't drive both them tax I didn't have any more tax so I put a little bit of piece of an old clay pigeon and been bursted there what Trap Shooters shoot at just about a qu of an inch across and tuck it out on 50 yards and he cut it half in Two and the scope was set for my eyes just a few years older than he was so he said you know what I've got to go by and tell Billy to keep off of my feet from now on so I said well I tell you what said let's go down show brother Norman that I said Joe and matches across the world I don't care who it would be nobody now the tax wasn't drove sideways they were drove straight through and that piece not over uh I guess a quar of an inch and a 16th thick and a qu of an inch high he cut it half and two at 50 yards I said there's no one in the world could have made a better shot they a Champions could have done the same thing but you couldn't have made three better shots than them the attack's Not Bent just a straight hole through the paper where the attack went through and uh I said no one could have made a better shot oh I think his headache left him right away and I said well let's go show this to brother Norman which works for the Field and Stream brother Tony str's Sporting Goods place he said um let's go buy Billy first he said I I just want to tell Bubby something and um frankly his brother's never done that good so he said we go by there first and just as I got in the door Billy was stilling his pajamas and he said we went out early because it gets so hot and U so he said um the phone ring and I said uh he kind of looked at me like that I said maybe a sick call it was brother caps for his boy in the operating room then with pontis and that pending and uh just now he told me his boy's recovering real real good so see how God just worked out even the voice of that little boy Joe instead of going down to brother Norman wouldn't have been there and come up and brother capside joined together I don't say it was our prayers that done it but it did mean something to him for us to make contact like that and frankly that's what when you got you got to have faith in what you're doing see and that his faith the call and Billy was is putting in money he said this must be a real long distance says he putting in PR $5 for the change in a three for a three minute call and I thought it' be coming from New York or out in one of the islands or something but he made a person to person called to get Billy instead of blow you see and that's what it cost him to do that and now his boy is recovering brother cap said the doctor giv him very little hope of ever coming out of it you see from the operation and we're thankful to God this morning amen very glad for it now we got in towards daylight this morning and uh I had about 3 hours sleep and and I'm pretty tired but when the church come time to come to church well I I come down and uh uh the Lord willing now I've got to go down and Kentucky and said then I've got promise to speak one Sunday while I was back here and I better make it this next Sunday because the following I'll be I have to go back because I'm going away again up in Canada so I I better make it next Sunday and next Sunday morning and um brother Neville said why don't you just go out and greet the people and talk to him just a few minutes I said brother Neville I haven't even opened my Bible already I said uh he said well go out and say something to him and sister Neville I I I don't know how you do it um he's a very persuasive fell but while I don't get a chance to say this when the place is all packed and crowded and everything but I'm very grateful to God for a pastor like brother Armen neille faithful just as faithful as he can be to the cause and never hear him grumbling I sat back there I had a good half hours talk with him while I was enjoying brother man and uh so I'll tell you more about that when we get Colorado this year so when we was U enjoying this message and uh I got a good talk with brother Neville I said I don't even get to tell the people nothing about our fine Pastor I said are the people treating you right said it couldn't be any better and I said well that's what I'm glad to hear when a pastor's satisfied and the people's satisfied it makes a real good good church and then God is satisfied and I think to see him satisfied together especially in this day of the message that we're carrying I think that shows the continuity of the message with the people and with God see and I'm very grateful for brother Arman Neville and his fine wife and family and I pray that God will keep them loyal to him and the cause and if it so please him may we be standing here in the tabern tacle when the Lord Jesus comes for us you see to take us away at the rapture we hope we're both so old brother NE one head one arm around the other and stand there on our King still trying to hold up then we'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye these old Robes of Flesh will drop and rise and SE the Everlasting prize and Shout while passing through the air farewell farewell Sweet Hour of Prayer we moved on up then heard about brother kummer's healing from the Lord and so thankful for that so many things so I am grateful to be here this morning and I thought instead of I'm always coming here with a certain text and speaking I thought i' just come out this morning and I said brother Neville I'll watch the clock real easy and probably let the people out on time and and just talk to you from the heart a few minutes just things just that we just have a no they're not taping it or anything so we just have Fellowship while it's just a church F sh see just us together so let's pray dear Jesus we are grateful to you for the privilege that we have of assembling together here no as I looked upon this Tabernacle early this morning after midnight passed by I thought of how you have stood by it and I think of the Old Pond that was here and big old weed standing up right about where this pullit sat as a little boy I I stood here and Mr Ingram said we could have the lot for just a little money and pay something down and no money no collateral or nothing to offer but just to try how that then as full face value was little over $2,000 with 20 years to pay it out and now Lord look at it now while it was in its infancy still sitting down in a hole here water pouring into it how that you promised us by the word I the Lord have planted it out of water day and night lest some shall pluck it from my hands the same time the people said within 6 months it'll be turned into a garage but literally thousands of souls has found Christ here at the altar and the Tabernacle the babst Tre has constantly people has been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Calling upon his name washing away their sins thank you hundreds of crippled Afflicted blind halt lame cancer eaten has walked away from this platform come in dying men women boys and girls and gone out to live a new life with a new Flesh on their bodies and walking again leave their wheelchairs crutches and so forth all got this 30 years of service father remember the morning that we laid the Cornerstone and you gave the vision over there showing the place packed and jammed a beautiful corner I I knew that that could not fail so thank you for all these things many of them has done fought a good fight and finished the course and kept the faith laying out are waiting resting now from their labors and their Works fallowing him waiting for the hour for the trumpet to sound and to Spring forth again into New Life a new body many of them old and shaken some young middle Ag and so forth but thy name be praised for all now we're standing here again before the the living and the dead I pray that you'll anoint your words this morning I don't know one thing to say but I pray that you'll furnish that which you've always did it Lord bless our pastor brother Neville his wife bless the trustees Deacon boards every member of the body made together we live so in this life that in the life to come we'll have eternal life help us this morning to take Corrections from the spirit and the word that we might prepare ourselves as we move away from the doors this morning determined in our heart to live a better life than we have in the past we ask it in Jesus name amen now I I just opened the Bible here and it happened to be a few minutes ago I'm I'm in Revelations 3 so I'll just uh read here on the the uh message to the ladyo Sea church and I want to announce also brother Nev just tell me brother Parnell is I had to look down in seam C here is in a in a Revival just this side of Memphis at the any of you know where the old wimpy the Hamburger Stand used to be he's got a a tent sitting in there trying trying to uh bring in the sheep and find if there's any lost ones out in that way that's been ordained to life that he might win through his ministry to Christ and he closed it up for Sunday on account of the services being the Tabernacle and that's very loyal of the brother and we want you to know that the service will be open Monday and night following next week and I know you're all Cally invited out to hear Brother Parnell bring his message of the the love of Christ and now let us read from Revelations the third chapter just a portion to say that we read the Bible because what I'd say might fail but what he says won't fail and I don't know where to start from what to do where to go but I'm just reading the lady to see a church age unto the angel of the Church of Lady of sin write these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness and the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy Works th are neither cold or hot I would wor the cold or hot so then because art lukewarm and neither cold or hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because I says I'm rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that th wretched miserable or poor blind naked I counsel of thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich white reignment that thou mayest be clothed and that thy shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes say that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent you know somewhere in there as I was reading uh you excuse me a minute I I found some place that sounded good to me and I don't know just where it was at now um here it is and knowest thou not wretched miserable poor blind naked oh my that's kind of the picture here of the church off the day now it's uh I think that that church age here that we're speaking of of course I've got the church age coming forth now in the books but being that is the lady ofm Church age that we're in let's just look at the conditions I don't want to take any text or anything because we're not just talking casually as we'd see to talk on whatever the Lord would lead us to do but something that would help us let's think of the lady Sea church age and its conditioned today as far as I know I don't see anything to hinder that this time of uh the coming of the Lord Jesus outside of the Readiness of his church I think that one of the the prophecies yesterday coming up in the car we drove it in two days from Tucson here right 2,000 miles the billion I and so we um now that wasn't breaking any speed laws we stated right I sat there if he's driving I'm all all got my fist back like a shotgun with a hammer back I see him G I said wait a minute boy uh we are told give Caesar watch Caesars then we come in down here last night a little girl in sprawled across the road about 3 years old mother dead over in a ditch some drunken boy coming from the RC's 18 years old driving 120 mph on the left hand side of the road killed and I guess he was dying too then you're going to realize what it is give season c Watch Caesars innocent people dying a little three-year-old girl lost her life because of some drunken Soldier uh driving 120 mph estimated on the wrong side of the road coming up over the hill shot right down killed him all right there together I he was dying too so and you can see even though the innocent party was doing now that boy is guilty of coldblooded murder I think if a man would be caught on the road drinking he ought to be given 10 years flat for a premature premeditated murder any man because it just any man we we'll never do any good with politics it's rotten God's idea of having a king a righteous King is right the politics just simply spread out you can buy anything out cheat Li steel everything else as I said a few Sundays ago and look look where you're at nothing but just a crooked massive everything but a righteous King can make his own laws and you can kill a man there no good politics that's all right you get out of it see and so it's it it the democracy is a good idea but it won't work you're like communism all things in common it sounds good but it won't work no the God's of having a king like David was was right and you got one mind centered over like one leader and a bunch of geers so forth you can't take two or three of them then you mess them all together you come up with any kind of an idea so we find the conditions today ready for the coming of the Lord but while brother Neville and I and these other brothers are trying to Shepherd a flock I've got something on my mind now that comes that we might talk about that is I got a letter the other day from a fine lady I never got it come through another person and she was certainly tearing me to pieces or trying to was saying did you ever can't you Christian businessman do something to stop brother brand said because that he's got this book out now called the lady see a church age bringing out more and said he's just simply tearing Pentecostal Doctrine to Pieces said now he's talking about the initial evidence ain't speaking in tongues and said then he's again swimming preachers and this was a woman preacher and her boys some of the best friends that I got in the world she they're among the best friends that I got and she said now and this man and wife is eating bread breakfast with him they said brother Bram look at this would you think it and pulled out a letter I said well sister she just don't understand the boys told me their mother was a woman preacher and and she didn't go for the message and now she says in here she said now he said women should not have authority over man said how about BBE in the Bible Paul's help her certainly she was a seller of goods and uh Paul asked the people you think Paul would say let the women keep silent in the churches not permitted them to speak and turn around and say now fee be my helper in the gospel you should go to preaching a few nights well he' contradict his own word and said then top of all I believe it was Esther was one of the judges in the Bible said a woman was a judge in the Bible if that's not authority over man and this businessman that was healed right here in the church not long ago he said now his wife said brother BR that always puzzled me I said well sister how would that puzzle you said well here is the woman judge I said that's politics not the church am I don't have nothing to do with the church Paul said let him be under obedience as also sayth the law and the law can't put a woman up to be a priest can't put it up you never seen a woman high priest you never seen a woman a priest nowhere in the Bible you never seen a woman a preacher in the Bible certainly some of them was propheus and so forth marry him and different ones and Esther one of them was a judge over Israel sometimes they were Queens over them and so forth like that king and queen the decease of the king the queen had to take his place to the elect of another king and so forth and two in Tucson Arizona we got a woman judge there in the city that's reason the city is so polluted and we got a woman ain't got no business in politics she got no business in the O over any Authority in the church her place is a man's Queen at home outside of that she has nothing and we know that to be the truth you will never find I know that sounds oldfashioned but I'm responsible and I know that after my going away from this Earth them tapes and them books will be living on and many of you young children will find in the days to come this is exactly the truth because I speak it in the name of the Lord now we wonder how a woman that's a good woman and she is brought on this Earth by her loyal husband a good man some of the finest boys that I I ever met their man uh I've ever met and just quickly just as soon as they heard the message they were sold on it 100% now that can only come by for ordination the only way it can come now the question is here I thinking that see now why the Lord was bring me back a know it no know it not th naked miserable wretched blind and know it not before I get to that spot I might brief what I said a few days ago here in a message on I believe it was the uh God of this world blinded the eyes of the people that they absolutely worship the devil in religious Services did you all get that all of you understood it and then in that same message I brought the subject that a woman wearing immoral clothes indecently she is be judged at the Judgment bar as a street prostitute that sounds awful strange let me draw you a little picture now here is an attorney in the city a young fellow and he's a nice man as far as as politically I imagine he may be decent in his politics and then um he goes with a girl that's very popular they fall in love and Mary they attend to all the parties and the great uh things and they all drink together finally she uh he has a nice home he lives in a nice neighborhood he's a well thought of amongst the people but he both of them drink she wears shorts cuts her hair wears makeup everything just as sexy as beautiful woman displaying herself well she never goes to church at all neither one of them so moving next door to him comes a woman from the Baptist Church or the Methodist Church her and her husband now this woman uh let's make it Methodist because [Music] [Music] l [Music] [Music] [Music] in oh
