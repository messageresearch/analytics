[27:10] Lord
[27:11] tonight praise
[27:13] God if you have come to hear from God
[27:17] you would hear the voice of
[27:19] God the voice of God is the word of
[27:24] God and you would hear the word and you
[27:27] know
[27:28] that this word is bearing your name tag
[27:32] on it you know that it is for
[27:37] you it's a very sad thing that you come
[27:42] to the house of
[27:44] God and you live the same way you came
[27:48] in as a matter of fact if you don't live
[27:52] the presence of God better than you
[27:55] came then you left worse than than you
[28:00] came you must receive something from
[28:04] God that is why we have to pay attention
[28:07] to the
[28:11] word when some are shouting praise the
[28:14] Lord
[28:17] hallelujah maybe it is not your turn yet
[28:20] when you are seated and nothing is
[28:22] knocking at the door of your
[28:25] heart that is not the time to take take
[28:28] your phone and start flipping
[28:30] through that is the time to pay more
[28:34] attention because God is meeting some
[28:37] people's
[28:39] needs and it is soon going to be your
[28:42] turn you don't know when your turn is
[28:45] going to
[28:46] be so if you are not paying
[28:49] attention the holy spirit will just come
[28:52] and just pass you by and then you leave
[28:55] church you said why did I even go to
[28:57] church
[28:58] praise the
[28:59] Lord God bless you all for coming
[29:03] tonight and um there are something
[29:07] something a few things the lord has laid
[29:09] on my heart and I would want us to look
[29:12] at them praise the
[29:15] Lord um if we can stand for the reading
[29:18] of the
[29:19] word and then turn to our turn our
[29:22] Bibles
[29:22] [Music]
[29:24] to Philippians 2
[29:28] Philippians
[29:45] 2 Philippians 25-10
[30:01] okay Philippians 2
[30:05] 5-10 I
[30:08] read let this mind be in
[30:11] you which was also in Christ
[30:15] Jesus who being in the form of God
[30:19] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[30:23] God but made himself of no reputation
[30:28] and took upon him a form of a
[30:31] servant and was made in the likeness of
[30:35] man and being found in fashion as a man
[30:41] he humbled himself and became obedient
[30:45] unto death even the death on the cross
[30:50] wherefore God also have highly exalted
[30:54] him and given him a name which is above
[30:58] every name that at the name of Jesus
[31:02] every knee shall
[31:04] bow of things in heaven of things in
[31:08] Earth and things under the Earth shall

[35:28] working no I am talking of a gas
[35:34] fireplace and what about a gas
[35:39] fireplace that you can move into a
[35:43] house or into a home or into an
[35:48] apartment with a
[35:51] fireplace and never turn it
[35:53] on till the time you leave or till the
[35:57] time you lease is
[36:00] over and what is special about
[36:03] it for those of you who have a gas
[36:06] fireplace when you go
[36:09] home when you sit at a distance you will
[36:13] not see fire there you can go and touch
[36:17] the
[36:18] glass you will not feel any burning
[36:20] sensation no
[36:23] heat but look
[36:25] further you will see
[36:29] something we call pilot
[36:33] light that there is always
[36:36] fire in
[36:40] there there is always at every given
[36:44] time when you look very very close you
[36:47] will see fire
[36:51] burning but you will never get that
[36:53] flame it is never going to produce heat
[36:57] you will never notice it but it has
[37:00] always been
[37:01] there praise the
[37:04] Lord and now the whole system is
[37:09] connected to the gas
[37:11] line that all you the inhabitant or the
[37:15] occupant of the house have to do is to
[37:18] flip the switch on and then you hear
[37:21] that sound
[37:23] boom and then there is
[37:26] light and then you you see it
[37:29] burning and then very soon the whole
[37:32] place is
[37:33] hot you can't even touch the glass
[37:37] anymore but until you do
[37:40] that that fire will always be there
[37:45] connected to the gas
[37:49] 24/7 and
[37:51] yet you will never have
[37:54] heat if that is what you are using as
[37:57] your source of heat you will never see
[38:00] the
[38:02] flame and then it struck me that that is
[38:07] how some of us
[38:12] are before you moved into that
[38:16] house that house had already been built
[38:19] with that inside
[38:22] there you didn't have to do anything
[38:25] about it all you had to do is just flip
[38:28] it on and
[38:31] off that God by his Divine wisdom has
[38:35] placed his seed in
[38:39] you he has placed his seed in
[38:44] you that seed of
[38:47] light it is
[38:51] there they can Heap all the sin of the
[38:54] world on you bury you under the weight
[38:57] of every
[38:59] it would never switch it off it is
[39:06] there and as small as it
[39:10] is as small as it is the whole of Heaven
[39:15] is connected to
[39:19] it that you just have to be so conscious
[39:24] enough to know
[39:29] that if I turn on the switch I am going
[39:32] to have a
[39:34] Revival sometimes we think having a
[39:36] Revival is 10 20 30 churches coming
[39:39] together and you have thousand 2,000
[39:41] people and there is no that is good it's
[39:45] fine we love
[39:48] it but if you can go in a meeting like
[39:52] that and still be the same after all is
[39:55] said and done then what is the
[40:01] Revival you can have a personal Revival
[40:05] with
[40:06] God that you can tap into into into into
[40:10] into
[40:11] God and get so w up by the Holy
[40:19] Spirit and you know that this is God at
[40:23] work and that it is not of men
[40:29] we carry that gem seed of
[40:32] life that fire in
[40:34] us it is there and we are not conscious
[40:39] of
[40:41] it and we just live
[40:44] anyhow a life of
[40:47] Darkness we don't even know where we
[40:49] belong we don't know whether we are
[40:51] going or we are coming we don't know who
[40:54] we
[40:55] are and all all we have to
[40:58] do is just turn the switch
[41:09] on I didn't know it was even connected
[41:12] to what I was going to say today but it
[41:15] happens to be to be in
[41:18] sync the
[41:20] theme of this message tonight is the
[41:25] weight of your confession
[41:30] the
[41:31] weight of your
[41:37] confession so just think about
[41:41] it a man or a woman that is carrying
[41:44] that seed of God in
[41:46] them and yet you look at their lives and
[41:50] you can't see it
[42:00] when you confess the
[42:02] Lord as your
[42:05] savior does it carry any any
[42:11] weight when you say the days of Miracles
[42:14] are not
[42:15] over does it carry any
[42:20] weight when you say a man can live a
[42:23] clean and a holy
[42:26] life does it carry any
[42:29] weight when you say you have
[42:34] believed does it carry any
[42:37] weight praise the Lord now the weight of
[42:41] your
[42:42] confession has nothing to do with what
[42:46] you
[42:48] confess it has nothing to do with what
[42:51] you
[42:53] see praise the
[42:55] Lord the disciple of the Lord Jesus in
[43:00] Antioch when the people looked at them
[43:03] their manner of dressing their word of
[43:06] talking the way they demonstrated the
[43:09] power of God healing the
[43:11] sick and demonstrating the power of God
[43:14] in holy living they looked at them and
[43:18] they said these are
[43:21] Christians in other words these are
[43:24] Christlike
[43:28] just by looking at their
[43:35] lives not at what they were
[43:38] saying but by looking at their lives
[43:42] they could
[43:43] say that these are
[43:46] Christlike they are
[43:50] Christians praise the Lord
[43:59] they had the Life of
[44:00] Christ flowing through their
[44:03] veins the Bible says let this mind be in
[44:08] you which also was in Christ
[44:11] Jesus you can't have the life of God or
[44:15] the Life of
[44:18] Christ without having the mind of
[44:23] God it doesn't work that way
[44:28] you can't
[44:32] have the Life of Christ without having
[44:35] the mind of
[44:37] Christ you can't have the mind of Christ
[44:40] and have the mind of the world at the
[44:42] same time the prophet
[44:45] speaking you can't be in your way and
[44:50] God's way at the same time it's either
[44:54] one or the other
[44:58] it's like serving two masters you can't
[45:01] serve two
[45:02] masters if the mind of Christ be in you
[45:07] then you will think like
[45:11] Christ and you need the mind of Christ
[45:15] to serve
[45:16] God you can't approach god with your
[45:20] human
[45:22] mind it is highly impossible to approach
[45:27] god with your human elements with your
[45:29] human
[45:33] mind that would only bring you to a
[45:37] place where you perform a
[45:40] religion okay you just perform your
[45:45] religion just do what you think you have
[45:47] to do not what the word requires of
[45:53] you and it's such a dangerous place to
[45:55] be
[45:59] when a man knows just too much to be
[46:04] religious that is a very dangerous place
[46:08] to ever
[46:09] be the mind of Christ in you will make
[46:13] you thirst for
[46:15] Holiness it will make you thir after God
[46:18] it will make you
[46:20] crave for the things of
[46:23] God it will num your desire for sin
[46:29] it will let you thirst and hunger for
[46:34] righteousness the mind of God in
[46:37] you would never bring you to a place to
[46:40] look at the world and seek after the
[46:46] world all your heart
[46:49] desire it's about the T of
[46:52] God you don't wander around
[46:57] and there is no wind of
[46:59] doctrine that can come and just blow you
[47:04] off because you are grounded in the word
[47:09] praise the
[47:12] Lord without the mind of Christ you have
[47:16] nothing to show for your Christian
[47:19] Life it's just
[47:21] you without the mind of Christ is just
[47:25] you
[47:27] remember we are talking about the weight
[47:30] of your
[47:31] confession praise the
[47:34] Lord
[47:36] now I wouldn't mention the name of that
[47:39] country but there was a country that is
[47:42] a country are are somewhere let me leave
[47:45] that country
[47:46] alone the president or should I say the
[47:51] head of state because he was a military
[47:53] Soldier he was he was a military person
[47:57] he told the Central Bank Governor to
[48:01] print more
[48:03] money
[48:05] because money was had to come by and the
[48:09] Central Bank Governor said no I can't do
[48:14] it he Wonder with his with with his
[48:17] people he said you have to print more
[48:19] money he said
[48:22] no and his men sees that governor and
[48:26] that was the end the world that was the
[48:30] last time the world ever heard of
[48:33] him nobody ever traced the whereabouts
[48:37] of that Governor that was his
[48:41] end and the pred the money anyhow and
[48:44] there was so manyy so much money in the
[48:47] economy and the money was as useless as
[48:54] useless as the trash beg you can find by
[48:57] the
[49:03] roadside a country can decide to turn on
[49:07] the money printing
[49:10] machines but if they don't have gold in
[49:14] their
[49:14] Reserve to back that money
[49:18] up is going to
[49:20] be just a little valuable than the
[49:24] ordinary paper you see
[49:26] because they don't have gold in their
[49:28] reserves to back it
[49:35] up and that is how sometimes our
[49:39] confessions
[49:44] are that we make the
[49:48] confessions and
[49:52] yet there is no life to back it up
[50:04] it is not so much about what you
[50:09] say we make the confessions all
[50:16] right but there is nothing that is
[50:18] backing it
[50:20] up you can look at your life and if you
[50:23] are that Earnest or if you are sincere
[50:27] you can say that oh there is a missing
[50:29] link
[50:32] somewhere and praise be to God if you
[50:35] can come to a place to see
[50:39] it that is if it exists in your
[50:45] life then it gives you room or the
[50:48] opportunity to change the
[50:51] Jus then you know that something must
[50:55] must be done
[50:57] praise the
[51:00] Lord the Bible says let your light so
[51:02] shine before
[51:04] men that they may see your good works
[51:07] and give the glory to your father which
[51:08] is in
[51:09] heaven that has to do with your
[51:13] life know so
[51:15] much about the things you say praise the
[51:20] Lord it is very very
[51:24] important that when you say
[51:27] something the person you are talking to
[51:31] should be able to see
[51:33] it in
[51:37] you they shouldn't try to sit and
[51:40] imagine what is this man talking about
[51:43] what is this sister talking about but
[51:45] they should be able to look at your
[51:47] life and then put it
[51:50] together that this thing this man is
[51:53] talking about this thing this sister is
[51:55] talking about I can see it in
[52:00] them the weight of your
[52:02] confession is the life you are
[52:06] living is the life you are
[52:11] living we are not living to please any
[52:15] man and sometimes we get to a place in
[52:18] our lives and we fear men more than we
[52:22] fear
[52:25] God that we we get to a place and we
[52:28] look across our shoulders to see who is
[52:30] there
[52:32] before we do what we want to
[52:35] do if you ever get to a place in your
[52:38] life and you have to look across your
[52:40] shoulders to look behind you to see
[52:43] whether there are any known faces
[52:46] whatever it is that you want to do it
[52:48] wouldn't end well don't do
[52:51] it don't do it
[52:57] if you a child of God you are not a
[52:59] child of God in
[53:01] secret you don't live a secret life your
[53:05] life is an open book your life is
[53:09] public people can look at you and see
[53:12] Christ in you but if they can look at
[53:15] you and not see
[53:18] Christ Lord have
[53:22] mercy they can say anything they want to
[53:25] say about you
[53:27] but when it comes to you and your God
[53:31] they will say
[53:33] but that sister is a
[53:36] Christian
[53:38] but that brother is a
[53:41] Christian praise the
[53:44] Lord what is the weight of your
[53:53] confession there was an auction
[53:57] now I have been in a lot of
[54:01] auctions way back in
[54:04] Africa where you go and they will sell
[54:07] everything nothing goes back including
[54:10] scraps those metal plates they look so
[54:13] useless if they were by the roadside you
[54:15] would not pick them but in an auction
[54:18] they are going to sell
[54:20] out they will just start from the low
[54:24] the lowest price
[54:27] $5 and this one say I give $10 this one
[54:31] will say oh 20 this say
[54:33] 30 and then when you hear going one
[54:36] going twice that means they ready to
[54:38] close that
[54:40] auction until somebody brings something
[54:43] higher you will hear
[54:46] sold and when they say sold you can
[54:50] bring 100 times the price it is
[54:53] sold but there was an option
[54:57] this auction here was not like any other
[55:03] auction and it was an
[55:06] auction of
[55:09] prisoners on death
[55:13] row that every
[55:17] year this Kingdom would bring one
[55:22] prisoner that was on a death row to be
[55:29] redeemed and then you have some rich
[55:31] people come around the
[55:34] clergy and they come
[55:36] around and that auction doesn't start
[55:39] from the lowest price and goes up no it
[55:42] starts from the top and guess who the
[55:44] auctioneer is the auctioner is always
[55:48] the
[55:49] prosecutor and then he
[55:51] comes he doesn't tell you how good this
[55:55] thing is and and how beneficial it would
[55:57] be for you to have it but he is telling
[56:00] you this man is a hopeless man this man
[56:03] is a useless man this man has killed a
[56:06] whole city this man has impoverished
[56:09] people he must die nobody should redeem
[56:12] him that is all he's coming to do and
[56:15] this is the price tag 1
[56:18] million there is nobody
[56:21] 500,000 nobody it keeps coming down then
[56:24] somebody says so yeah yes I give I give
[56:27] 100,000 and somebody says no 101 and
[56:31] then
[56:33] sold but one day they brought a
[56:39] prisoner and they put him
[56:42] there and all these redeemers gathered
[56:46] together and the persecutor came and the
[56:50] prosecutor
[56:52] said this man here Must Die
[57:02] he he was a
[57:05] drunk he was a
[57:08] robber he was fighting
[57:12] everywhere he is a
[57:16] meder and he listed all the
[57:20] crimes he belonged to a
[57:23] gang the most terrible gang everybody
[57:25] knew
[57:26] off and he said this man nobody has to
[57:30] release him if you release him he's
[57:34] going to go back to his old ways and you
[57:37] are going to pay the
[57:41] price and then he started 1
[57:44] million 500 100
[57:48] 50 till he came to
[57:52] $1 nobody offered to buy him
[57:58] then he said okay if anybody needed him
[58:00] for free take
[58:03] him and the people looked into their
[58:05] face and said no this man must die he
[58:08] has been so so wicked we are not going
[58:10] to redeem him and then he knew that he
[58:14] had come to the
[58:16] weights his life's
[58:19] end and he was just looking ahead in his
[58:22] in in his in his Mind's Eye how he was
[58:25] going going to be hang on the
[58:30] ropes and before they could close the
[58:33] auction a Man from Nowhere walk in and
[58:38] interrupted the whole
[58:40] process he said I am going to buy this
[58:43] prisoner and everybody turned and looked
[58:45] at
[58:47] him this man is dangerous don't buy
[58:51] him is the reason nobody has bought him
[58:54] else wouldn't have met him here he said
[58:56] I am going to buy him there a prosecutor
[58:59] said you can't buy him he's a dangerous
[59:01] criminal he said I am going to buy him
[59:03] what is the price tag he said 1 million
[59:05] he said you know what I am going to
[59:07] offer 2 million for
[59:10] him and then he bought this man to the
[59:14] amazement of
[59:17] everybody and when he bought him
[59:20] everybody was saying this man is just a
[59:23] matter of time and he's going to go back
[59:26] to the street it's just a matter of time
[59:29] and we are going to hear of him again in
[59:32] the purpose so they were just looking
[59:36] when they buy their newspapers they were
[59:38] just looking forward to see something
[59:39] like
[59:40] that but when this rich man bought
[59:43] him he sat with him he said you know I
[59:47] have seen a lot of potential in you a
[59:51] potential you yourself do not know you
[59:54] have so do you know what
[59:57] I want you to go back to school he was a
[59:59] College Dropout he said yes I will go he
[1:00:02] went
[1:00:04] back to cut the long matter
[1:00:07] short after several years he came out as
[1:00:11] a
[1:00:14] lawyer as a
[1:00:16] lawyer the first time the public would
[1:00:19] get to hear of him
[1:00:21] again it was not in any arm robbery case
[1:00:26] it was not in any M case it was not in
[1:00:30] any criminal act but he was standing in
[1:00:33] the
[1:00:34] court to defend
[1:00:37] somebody because he said that he was
[1:00:41] given a second
[1:00:42] chance and that he was also going to
[1:00:45] give people a second chance he said
[1:00:49] everybody deserved a second chance he
[1:00:52] had it and he was going to pay it back
[1:00:55] and he was offering his Services free of
[1:01:00] charge praise the Lord now this is not
[1:01:04] the most important part of this story
[1:01:06] the most important part of the story was
[1:01:10] any time he came to court the same
[1:01:14] prosecutor that wanted him
[1:01:17] dead he will be standing there trying to
[1:01:21] get somebody
[1:01:22] in and this man is on the other side
[1:01:25] trying to get him
[1:01:27] out even though he knew what to say he
[1:01:31] was a brilliant lawyer he knew what to
[1:01:35] say it was not what he said that made
[1:01:40] the
[1:01:41] difference but he got to that place and
[1:01:44] he said look at my
[1:01:47] life once I was a
[1:01:50] thief but I still no more once I was a
[1:01:54] robber I robbed no more
[1:01:56] once I was a drunk I drink no more once
[1:02:00] I was a murderer I don't kill anymore I
[1:02:03] was given a second chance look at
[1:02:06] me this man standing here deserves a
[1:02:09] second
[1:02:10] chance there is something good that can
[1:02:12] come out of his life and the people look
[1:02:15] at
[1:02:17] him he say if this man we all read about
[1:02:21] if this man we all knew today is stand
[1:02:26] here clean probably cleaner than every
[1:02:30] one of us on the
[1:02:32] jury then it means that this other
[1:02:35] person deserves a second chance and he
[1:02:38] won every single case in
[1:02:42] court
[1:02:44] why
[1:02:47] because his confession was not an empty
[1:02:51] confession it was
[1:02:54] backed by the reality of his personal
[1:02:57] life that the people will look at
[1:03:01] him and they can't question
[1:03:04] it he didn't leave anybody in
[1:03:10] doubt so it is not so much about what
[1:03:14] you
[1:03:15] say but so much about the life you are
[1:03:24] living that when you tell somebody about
[1:03:28] Christ can they look at your life and
[1:03:31] see Christ in
[1:03:33] you when you tell them you have
[1:03:36] believed can they look at your
[1:03:39] life and see a believer in
[1:03:43] you when you tell them God is real and
[1:03:48] he is still in the business of changing
[1:03:50] lives can they look at you and see that
[1:03:54] God in you that those that have known
[1:03:57] you before and from the time you said
[1:03:59] you have
[1:04:01] believed can then look at you and see
[1:04:05] any change in your
[1:04:08] life or you are the same old
[1:04:11] person just carrying the name of Christ
[1:04:14] in
[1:04:18] vain or they can look at you and it's
[1:04:21] just
[1:04:23] not you saying something
[1:04:26] but they look at you and they can't deny
[1:04:31] that
[1:04:34] indeed there is something real about
[1:04:37] this
[1:04:39] God praise the
[1:04:42] Lord It's
[1:04:44] good to let people know who you are
[1:04:48] where you stand what you
[1:04:50] believe but after having said all that
[1:04:57] after having said all that what do you
[1:05:00] have to
[1:05:03] show do you have something to back it
[1:05:07] up that you can say look at my
[1:05:10] life once upon a time I was a
[1:05:13] wretch once upon a time I was a thief
[1:05:17] once upon a time I was so Troublesome I
[1:05:20] was a
[1:05:22] headache but look at me
[1:05:26] see what the power of God can
[1:05:29] do that they can look at your
[1:05:32] life and see that
[1:05:35] oh indeed this is not the same person we
[1:05:38] knew
[1:05:42] before the weight of your confession
[1:05:46] your
[1:05:48] confession has a lot of weight praise
[1:05:51] the Lord
[1:06:03] and when I look at the
[1:06:11] man when I look at this man
[1:06:15] here his life rings the
[1:06:22] bell you can look at yourself
[1:06:26] that once upon a time you and I were
[1:06:30] Bound for the
[1:06:35] slaughter we were deeply immersed in
[1:06:41] sin there was nothing we could do about
[1:06:45] it we had nowh to
[1:06:52] turn all we were just waiting is to die
[1:06:55] and go to heav
[1:06:57] H but God rich in
[1:07:01] Mercy Sent His only begotten
[1:07:04] son who came and died in our place that
[1:07:08] we would live he gave his life for you
[1:07:11] and I he paid the price for our
[1:07:16] freedom he paid the
[1:07:18] price you don't belong to
[1:07:22] you you are purchased
[1:07:26] by the
[1:07:28] blood you are the pures of his
[1:07:33] blood and like that rich man set that
[1:07:36] that prisoner
[1:07:38] free we are
[1:07:42] not
[1:07:44] bought and set free so we would go
[1:07:48] back into sin
[1:07:51] anymore
[1:07:53] sometimes your friends some times
[1:07:56] relatives sometimes those who know
[1:08:00] you when you give your life to Christ
[1:08:03] what do they say oh don't mind him don't
[1:08:05] mind him it's just a matter of
[1:08:09] time he'll be coming back into this
[1:08:11] ghetto we'll be smoking that pop
[1:08:13] together don't mind
[1:08:15] him and when you give your life to
[1:08:17] Christ and you are serving God they are
[1:08:20] there waiting to see you
[1:08:23] back like those people were there
[1:08:25] waiting to see that
[1:08:27] man to see him back in the
[1:08:31] newspapers because they knew to
[1:08:33] themselves that it was just a matter of
[1:08:35] time that and he was going to commit the
[1:08:37] next
[1:08:39] crime when you say you have given your
[1:08:42] life to Christ there are people who know
[1:08:45] you who are looking at you they are
[1:08:48] monitoring you they wouldn't tell you
[1:08:51] and they are just
[1:08:53] watching and they are telling telling
[1:08:55] themselves that this man is going to
[1:08:57] come back this woman is going to come
[1:09:00] back and look the worst thing you can
[1:09:03] ever
[1:09:04] do the worst thing you can ever
[1:09:07] do after you say you have
[1:09:11] believed after you
[1:09:13] say goodbye to the
[1:09:16] world and then you turn right back and
[1:09:18] go into the errors from which you were
[1:09:21] delivered from that is the worst thing
[1:09:23] you can do
[1:09:26] then they say ah but we said it we said
[1:09:28] it we said he was going to come back he
[1:09:30] has come
[1:09:34] back what else can you ever tell
[1:09:40] them but when you go and they are
[1:09:44] waiting to see you back and you never
[1:09:47] come back and all the see you is growing
[1:09:51] in Christ your life is transformed that
[1:09:54] you are a new Creation in God that your
[1:09:58] life has changed they look at you they
[1:10:00] Envy
[1:10:02] you sometimes they try to pull some
[1:10:04] strength to see if they can get you
[1:10:07] back and if that is not working guess
[1:10:10] what you are influencing their
[1:10:15] lives if there was anybody that was
[1:10:17] going to influence them to serve God it
[1:10:22] is
[1:10:23] you because they knew you
[1:10:27] before they knew who you were before
[1:10:30] they knew how far you have
[1:10:32] come and now they know that that God is
[1:10:36] real that if that God can do it for you
[1:10:39] he can do it for me
[1:10:45] also what is the
[1:10:48] weight of your
[1:10:52] confession with freedom comes
[1:10:59] responsibility we are bought and paid
[1:11:02] for by the
[1:11:05] blood we are
[1:11:07] free there is Liberty in the house of
[1:11:10] God we are a free people but with that
[1:11:14] freedom comes
[1:11:18] responsibility not
[1:11:20] recklessness you don't do something
[1:11:22] because you want to do it
[1:11:29] someone bought your
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:32] Redemption you are now living to please
[1:11:35] him not
[1:11:43] you praise the
[1:11:47] Lord with freedom comes
[1:11:52] responsibility you don't desire your
[1:11:54] will anymore
[1:11:56] by the will of the
[1:12:04] father and when God has redeemed
[1:12:07] you he redeems you for one
[1:12:14] thing so you can serve
[1:12:23] him so you can serve
[1:12:29] him serve him in spirit and in
[1:12:35] truth in spirit and in
[1:12:39] truth can you set your heart
[1:12:43] tonight set your heart
[1:12:46] tonight and tell yourself in
[1:12:49] confidence that I am serving God in
[1:12:52] spirit and in truth
[1:12:57] can
[1:12:58] you if not what is holding you
[1:13:04] back what has been in your
[1:13:07] way what is the
[1:13:10] hindrance what are the
[1:13:14] obstacles what is holding you
[1:13:18] back and for how long would you continue
[1:13:22] to deal with that
[1:13:27] some of us have come come one year 2
[1:13:30] years 5 years 10 years 15 20 30 40
[1:13:37] 50 but if in all your years of
[1:13:45] service you have not actually entered
[1:13:49] into that inner courts of God you have
[1:13:52] done yourself a disservice
[1:13:57] to him that much is given much shall be
[1:14:05] required I remember one time I was
[1:14:07] talking to Dan and Joshua that was in
[1:14:09] those
[1:14:11] days and I quoted this scripture and I
[1:14:14] could look at Dan's
[1:14:17] face and I was trying to read what I saw
[1:14:19] from his face it's difficult to read a
[1:14:23] human being do
[1:14:26] and it was like
[1:14:28] H if to him that much is given much
[1:14:31] shall be required then it was better I
[1:14:33] didn't even know too
[1:14:38] much he didn't say that but I could feel
[1:14:43] it so I just went on I said look you
[1:14:47] know more so much shall be required of
[1:14:50] you praise the Lord
[1:15:02] it was so
[1:15:05] heartwarming so
[1:15:07] refreshing when that rich
[1:15:10] man who
[1:15:12] redeemed The Prisoner
[1:15:16] saw that the
[1:15:18] prisoner just came out went to school
[1:15:22] got a law degree and was practicing and
[1:15:25] not only that but when he started
[1:15:27] offering his
[1:15:29] services to the people who needed it he
[1:15:33] had a Common Language he said they
[1:15:37] needed a second
[1:15:39] chance and that was the same
[1:15:43] mind that the rich man
[1:15:46] had that was the same
[1:15:50] mind he had the mind of the rich man
[1:15:56] who said this man needs a second
[1:15:59] chance after all his
[1:16:02] education when he came out he was
[1:16:05] defending the people and he had the same
[1:16:10] mind that these people need a second
[1:16:15] chance the most glorious
[1:16:18] thing that could ever be is you having
[1:16:21] the mind of God
[1:16:25] the mind of God that same mind of God
[1:16:29] how had woman that was to the rich man
[1:16:32] that he could look at this man and see
[1:16:34] himself in
[1:16:39] him and when God can just look down and
[1:16:43] see that you have his
[1:16:46] mind that you are just living by the
[1:16:49] word Nothing by the word that you have
[1:16:52] held the word of God
[1:16:55] in high
[1:16:57] esteem and that if it will cost you to
[1:17:01] turn your back on the word you prefer
[1:17:05] death and when you ever get
[1:17:08] there you are going to see God in the
[1:17:10] way you never
[1:17:12] dream and we saw that in the lives of M
[1:17:17] M shedra
[1:17:18] Cano when they were asked to Bow before
[1:17:21] the
[1:17:23] image they had so much regard for the
[1:17:27] word that they had the mind of God and
[1:17:30] they knew who they were and what they
[1:17:32] were supposed to
[1:17:34] do and they said no it's not something
[1:17:37] we are even going to think
[1:17:39] about God will deliver us and if he
[1:17:42] chooses not so be it we are going to die
[1:17:45] for
[1:17:46] it we saw that in the in in Daniel's
[1:17:49] life when he was casting the Lions
[1:17:53] then when you give yourself to the
[1:17:57] word and because you have given yourself
[1:18:00] to the
[1:18:02] word which you can never do except you
[1:18:04] have the mind of Christ in
[1:18:07] you you can never do it until you have
[1:18:11] the mind of
[1:18:13] Christ that would make you to conform to
[1:18:16] the holy
[1:18:17] ghost that would make you to conform to
[1:18:20] the word of God that would make you to
[1:18:22] give yourself to the word Fe on the word
[1:18:26] live by the word that you would exem the
[1:18:29] word of God more than your your daily
[1:18:35] bread tomorrow when the journey is over
[1:18:38] God is not going to ask
[1:18:41] you what work you did how much money you
[1:18:44] made how many mansions you had it's all
[1:18:47] good I'm not against
[1:18:49] that what did you do with my
[1:18:53] word what did did you do with my
[1:18:57] word and except you have the mind of
[1:19:01] God the word of God would not mean
[1:19:03] anything to
[1:19:07] you and except you have the mind of God
[1:19:11] your confession is going to be nothing
[1:19:14] but an empty
[1:19:16] confession because you will say
[1:19:20] something that you don't have the life
[1:19:22] to back it up
[1:19:25] that people look at you so don't mind
[1:19:27] him he's a
[1:19:30] hypocrite the things he's talking about
[1:19:32] it can never be done why because they
[1:19:34] have not seen it in
[1:19:36] you but if they see it in you there is
[1:19:40] no way they will say oh that thing
[1:19:43] cannot be done because they are seeing
[1:19:45] it you are an
[1:19:48] evidence that it is
[1:19:52] true give yourself to the
[1:19:57] world I am not saying that when you give
[1:20:00] yourself to the word of God things are
[1:20:02] going to be Rosy and dundy and nice and
[1:20:06] no that is probably when you are going
[1:20:08] to guess the worst time of your
[1:20:11] life but if it is because you have given
[1:20:14] yourself to the
[1:20:17] word just tell yourself it is SW with My
[1:20:21] Soul
[1:20:24] when you are going through the storms
[1:20:27] because you have believed
[1:20:29] God tell yourself It Is Well with My
[1:20:34] Soul if because you have turned away
[1:20:37] from sin and have decided to serve God
[1:20:41] in spirit and in
[1:20:43] truth and because of that things are not
[1:20:46] going well tell yourself It Is Well with
[1:20:50] My
[1:20:51] Soul the devil can come and tell you see
[1:20:54] see how all your friends are prospering
[1:20:57] see how impoverished you
[1:20:59] are that your God is not real you know
[1:21:03] better tell yourself It Is Well with My
[1:21:10] Soul the devil will tell you you
[1:21:12] probably went to your girls your
[1:21:14] friend's room to go and borrow
[1:21:17] toothpaste in order to be able to brush
[1:21:19] your teeth that
[1:21:21] morning tell yourself
[1:21:25] It Is Well with My
[1:21:27] Soul if God has to keep me there so I
[1:21:31] can be faithful if God has to keep me
[1:21:35] there to honor His holy
[1:21:39] name I rather be
[1:21:41] there and no other
[1:21:47] place and always
[1:21:49] remember if it's because you have been
[1:21:52] so faithful to God and you are are doing
[1:21:55] the will of God you are walking in the
[1:21:57] perfect will of God and then you get
[1:21:59] into trouble just hold your
[1:22:05] peace sometimes these storms
[1:22:09] come because God wants to do something
[1:22:14] greater in our lives he is already doing
[1:22:18] something but he wants to take you to
[1:22:21] another level a higher level
[1:22:24] and
[1:22:25] sometimes you are so busy a child of God
[1:22:30] that you don't even have time to seek
[1:22:31] the face of
[1:22:33] God and God brings these obstacles and
[1:22:37] the obstacle is so big maybe from the
[1:22:40] beginning he brought a small one and you
[1:22:42] jumped
[1:22:43] it and then he brought another Higher
[1:22:45] One you scaled it and then he brought
[1:22:48] another one you probably want to Lo for
[1:22:50] a ladder and you climbed and jumped over
[1:22:52] it then now he break you to a very big
[1:22:57] one big
[1:23:00] enough to engage your
[1:23:03] attention big
[1:23:05] enough that you have to call it a
[1:23:10] halt because God needs your
[1:23:15] attention praise the
[1:23:19] lord we have 4 minutes to
[1:23:22] go in the message
[1:23:34] 1951 faith is the
[1:23:37] substance paragraph
[1:23:40] 43 and if there is
[1:23:44] anybody that I didn't like why I would
[1:23:48] try to make it right with
[1:23:50] them and I try to be as sincere
[1:23:55] here and act like a Christian as much as
[1:23:59] I can be at my home or
[1:24:03] anywhere everywhere I go I've always
[1:24:06] tried to do what was right and try to
[1:24:10] leave what I speak about and talk
[1:24:15] about and I'd rather any man would leave
[1:24:20] me a sermon than preach me one
[1:24:24] for we are written
[1:24:27] Epistles read of all
[1:24:29] men I'd rather live right and have my
[1:24:33] name
[1:24:35] clear where my master could
[1:24:42] say why my master could say he's a
[1:24:45] Christian and the people say he's a
[1:24:48] Christian I don't know one thing I ever
[1:24:51] seen him do wrong pray praise be to
[1:24:56] God again in the message
[1:24:59] 1957 the lamb and the dve paragraph 13
[1:25:04] now no matter how much you
[1:25:08] preach and got a real ill temper
[1:25:14] don't do
[1:25:16] you much good to preach see no matter
[1:25:20] how much you join
[1:25:22] church and try to to
[1:25:25] impersonate if you are crabbing and
[1:25:28] nasty with your neighbor you will never
[1:25:31] win him to Christ see is the fruit of
[1:25:34] the spirit as my wife used to tell me
[1:25:38] actions speak louder than
[1:25:41] words that's right leave me a
[1:25:45] sermon instead of preaching me
[1:25:49] one that's a good thing leave me a
[1:25:53] sermon
[1:25:55] instead of preaching me
[1:25:57] one if you have a sermon to preach the
[1:26:00] musicians can come over if you have a
[1:26:03] seron to preach to your
[1:26:07] neighbor your
[1:26:09] life is what does the
[1:26:12] work because that neighbor is looking at
[1:26:16] you day in day out as you are coming to
[1:26:19] church and going back they have their
[1:26:22] eyes on you
[1:26:24] sometimes you think they don't know
[1:26:25] about your movement when they are up
[1:26:28] there and they open their window they
[1:26:30] can tell exactly when you left home and
[1:26:32] exactly when you came
[1:26:35] back they know when you go to
[1:26:39] church and they know what happens in
[1:26:41] your
[1:26:42] home you probably wouldn't think about
[1:26:46] it if there is anything that is going to
[1:26:50] influence their lives it's not so much
[1:26:56] about you going to tell
[1:27:00] them God is
[1:27:02] real we have a a living God that is
[1:27:07] good God turn lives around God can
[1:27:11] change your life Christ died for
[1:27:14] us God has sent us a prophet oh that's
[1:27:19] wonderful but your
[1:27:21] life is what they are looking at
[1:27:25] your life is what does the
[1:27:28] [Music]
[1:27:30] preaching if what you are
[1:27:33] saying if what you are
[1:27:36] saying does
[1:27:38] not conform to the life you are living
[1:27:41] they look at you and they laugh at
[1:27:44] you they may not laugh at you in the
[1:27:48] face but they look at you and they laugh
[1:27:51] at you
[1:27:55] what is the weight of your confession as
[1:27:58] a
[1:28:00] Believer what's your what was the weight
[1:28:02] of your confession as a
[1:28:07] Christian what is the weight of your
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:12] confession when you say God is real what
[1:28:15] is the weight of your
[1:28:16] confession when you are telling your
[1:28:18] neighbor or your coworker about Christ
[1:28:21] how much weight does it carry
[1:28:27] do they look at you as a as a
[1:28:30] Storyteller as somebody that is talking
[1:28:32] about something they don't know or they
[1:28:35] can look at your
[1:28:36] [Music]
[1:28:39] life and say
[1:28:42] something this one just came
[1:28:47] in somewhere last year or was it last
[1:28:50] two years I want to work and I was
[1:28:53] assign to go help
[1:28:56] somewhere I think I told that story
[1:28:59] before and I had this butcher
[1:29:02] knife very very long and
[1:29:05] sharp and it was iced
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:10] meat slabs of
[1:29:12] meat that were so iced and they just
[1:29:16] came together so
[1:29:18] solid and I was trying to divide
[1:29:21] it and I used a knife
[1:29:24] I tried so you could imagine how much
[1:29:26] pressure I put on it and it just
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:31] slipped God is so
[1:29:33] gracious the easiest place the knife
[1:29:36] could have gone was
[1:29:38] here because this was the way I held
[1:29:41] it but God be so
[1:29:45] good the knife just
[1:29:49] cut this middle finger and this finger
[1:29:52] here just took it off
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:57] it took it off before I even realized
[1:30:00] it that when they called The First
[1:30:02] Responders and they
[1:30:04] came they looked at my finger and said
[1:30:06] no he's missing a piece of his finger
[1:30:09] and they had to go back to go and search
[1:30:11] for
[1:30:13] it that was how bad it was it was
[1:30:16] bleeding so bad they had to tie it it
