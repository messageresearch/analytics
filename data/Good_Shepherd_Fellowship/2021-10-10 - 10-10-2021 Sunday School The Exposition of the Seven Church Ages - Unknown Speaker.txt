========================================

[Music] so [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god what a thrilling thought is this that tree of life in the garden of eden which could not be approached unto because of the fall of adam is now given to the overcomer the flaming sword of the guarding cherubim has been sheathed but it was not sheathed air its blade was bloody with the blood of the lamb let us meditate upon this truth a while as we consider why the tree was denied to adam and his descendants but now aloud again god's intention for his creation man is to express his words in genesis adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed that is true is it not but did adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word then there arose moses what a great and mighty man he was yet he also failed to live by every word and that prophet the type of the great prophet to come failed in anger to obey the word and there was also david the great king of israel a man after god's own heart he failed by adultery when he was tempted but eventually in the fullness of time there came one the head even jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god then was satan foiled for here was one who lived by it is written and that masterpiece of god overcame by reflecting god's word then was this manifested perfect one given to the cross as the perfect lamb of god for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life and then that life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the word of god and now to these sons of god who by him overcome are given the privilege of the paradise of god and the constant fellowship of jesus christ there will never more be any separation from him whether he goes his bride will go what is his he shares with his beloved on a joint air relationship the secret things will be revealed the dark things will be made plain we shall know as we are known and we shall be like him this is the heritage of the overcomer who has overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of testimony to jesus christ how we long for that day when the crooked roads will all be straightened and we will be with him time without end may that day hasten its appearance and may we hasten to obey his word and thereby prove our worthiness to share his glory he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank god in the last age there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ chapter 4 the smyrnian church age revelation 2 8-11. and unto the angel of the church of smyrna write these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death introduction in order to refresh your minds i want to point out again how we arrive at finding the names of the messengers to the various ages god in his sovereign will has seen to it that the history of the new testament church was not lost even as he saw to it that the history of israel would not be lost by placing it in the bible and corroborating it today from multitudes of scrolls earthen vessels and other artifacts that archaeologists have discovered and interpreted we actually have a running commentary of bible history from the first page up to now thus by reading history we can find out what man or men in the various ages were the closest to god's original pattern the apostle paul the ones that god used to bring his people back to the word of truth would be the ones to examine then out of those there would be one for every age who would stand out the clearest as the closest in word pattern and power that one would be the messenger the ages also are found by a study of history one simply needs to read the ages as found in revelation and it all patterns perfectly with history as indeed it must since the church ages were foretold by god and their very conditions revealed then of necessity the history that would follow would be as the bible sets forth it is that simple but then simplicity is the key to the word now with all this i have not simply been a student and a historian i have sought to be a spiritual minded man and it was only with the definite approval of the spirit of god that i chose the man i have chosen this is true as god knows my heart the messenger using our god-given rule of choosing the messenger for each age we unhesitatingly declare that irenaeus was exalted by the lord to that position he was the disciple of that great saint and warrior of faith polycarp and it is no doubt as he sat at the feet of that great man he learned the christian graces that flowed from his consecrated life for polycarp was one of the truly illustrious saints of all ages when viewed in the light of a blameless life you will remember from your own reading that polycarp was martyred too old to flee and too sincere man to allow another to hide him and then suffer a penalty for doing so he gave himself up to death but before he did he asked for and was granted permission to pray two hours for his brethren in the lord for the governor for his enemies and his captors like the great saints of all ages and desiring a better resurrection he stood firm refusing to deny the lord and died with a free conscience he was placed at the stake untied at his own request and the fire was lit the fire bent away from his body refusing to touch him he was then pierced through with a sword as this was done water gushed from his side drowning the flames his spirit was actually seen to depart in the form of a white dove released from his bosom yet for all this great testimony this student of john the revelator was not militant against the nicolaitan system for he himself leaned toward organization not realizing that the desire for fellowship and what appeared like a good plan to foster the work of god was really a trick of the enemy with irenaeus this was not so he was militant against any form of organization also his life history wherein he served the lord was one of much manifestation in the holy spirit and the word was taught with unusual clarity and conformity to its original precepts his churches in france were known to have the gifts of the spirit among them for the saints spoke in tongues prophesied raised the dead and healed the sick by the prayer of faith he saw the danger of any kind of organized brotherhood among the elders pastors etc he stood solidly for a unified spirit-filled gift-manifesting local church and god honored him for the power of god manifested among the saints he was also clear on his understanding of the godhead and since he was the disciple of polycarp who in turn was the disciple of saint john we can know for sure he had as perfect teaching as is possible on this subject in volume 1 page 412 of the anti-nicene fathers we have this statement by him on the godhead all the other expressions likewise bring out the title of one and the same being the lord of power the lord the father of all god almighty most high creator maker and such like these are not the names and the titles of a succession of different beings but of one and the same he pointed out clearly that these are but titles as his rows of sharon bright and morning star fairest of ten thousand etc neither is there but one god his name is lord jesus christ thus with his strict adherence to the word his wonderful understanding of scripture and the attendance of the power of god upon that ministry he is the right choice for the age it is altogether unfortunate that the other ages did not have in their messengers such a balance of fruit power and leadership in the holy spirit and the word smyrna the city of smyrna was a little north of ephesus at the mouth of the smyrna gulf because of its very fine harbor it was a commercial center renowned for its exports it was also distinguished for its schools of rhetoric philosophy medicine sciences and fine buildings many jews lived there and they were bitterly opposed to christianity even more so than were the romans in fact polycarp the first bishop at smyrna was martyred by the jews and it is said that the jews desecrated their holy day saturday to carry the wood that would make his funeral pyre the word smyrna means bitter being derived from the word myrrh myrrh was used in embalming the dead thus we have a twofold significance found in the name of this age it was a bitter age filled with death the two vines within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the true vine on the part of the false death was not only the seed of the false vine but even in the true vine there was a creeping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after pentecost and no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of god as seen by multitudes of examples in the old testament organization was growing apace confirming and augmenting the death of the membership for holy ghost leadership was deposed and the word was replaced by creeds dogmas and man-made ritual when israel entered into unlawful alliances with the world and formed fellowships by marriage the day finally came when the world took over and babylon carried away the people of god into captivity now when they went into captivity they went in having a priesthood a temple and the word but when they came back they had rabbis a theological order of pharisees a synagogue and the talmud and when jesus came they were so corrupt that he called them of their father the devil and this in spite of the fact they were of abraham according to the flesh in this age we see the same thing happening however as all israel is not israel but a little group were the true spiritual israelites so there would always be a little group of true christians the bride of christ until he came for his own in this city there were two famous temples one was the temple erected to the worship of zeus and the other was erected to sibily and between these two temples was found the most beautiful road of ancient times called the golden street to me this depicts a further inroad of paganism that had already started in the first age but was known to exist only at rome the joining of the two temples of a god and goddess is the seed of mariola tree wherein mary is called the mother of god and receives honor and titles and powers giving her a co-equality with jesus christ the golden street that joins them is a picture of the greed that caused the nicolaitan organizers to join state and church because they knew the wealth and power it offered them as the ephesian age was but the seed bed for the tragic pergamian age that was yet in the future this smyrnian age was the rain the sun and the nourishment that ensured the vile corruption that would confirm the church in idolatry which is spiritual fornication from which she would never rise death was permeating her route to branch and they that partook of her partook of bitterness and death this age lasted from 170 to 312 a.d the salutation revelation 2 8 these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive the first and the last which was dead and is alive now these are not the words of a man a mere man could he speak from the grave would say i am the first and the last which was alive and is dead the first thing that happens to a man is that he is born is alive and the last thing that happens is that he dies so this is not a man speaking this is deity man adam took life and turned it into death but this man jesus took death and turned it into life adam took innocence and turned it into guilt this one took guilt and turned it into righteousness adam took a paradise and turned it into a waste howling wilderness but this one is coming back to turn an earth rocking and reeling with destruction into another eden adam took a life of fellowship and joy with god and turned it into a desert of spiritual darkness that brought forth all sin moral decay pain suffering delusion and corruption that wars within the souls of men but this one from all the tragic death and degradation that filled mankind brought forth a life of righteousness and beauty so that as sin once reigned unto death even so might men now reign in righteousness by one christ jesus and not as the offense was though terrible indeed it was but now much more is his gift unto eternal life and here he is walking in the midst of those whom he has redeemed even his church and what were those who were redeemed were not many like paul murderers and corrupters were not many like the dying thief robbers and men killers all trophies of his grace all brought back from the dead all made alive in christ jesus the lord i wonder if you noted this salutation to the first age and then noted the one to this age just put them together these things sayeth he that holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks in the midst of the churches these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive this is one and the same person and he is letting us know that the church is his as the seed of the fruit is in the midst of the fruit so is he the royal seed in the midst of the church as the seed alone has life in it so is he the author of life to the church his walking signifies his untiring care of it he is the chief shepherd watching over his own that is his right for he bought that church with his own blood that blood is the blood of god the one who owns that church is god very god he is the first and the last that title spells eternity he was dead and is alive he paid the price so he has sole ownership of the temple of god he rules it he is worshiped in it he resents anyone taking over his lordship and authority no doubt the reason he introduces himself to each age as deity is to warn and comfort the people he warns the false vine and he comforts the true vine this is the one true almighty god hear him and live conditions of the age revelation 2 9 i know thy works and thy tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan the key to this age is most evidently tribulation if there was tribulation in the first age there is now predicted an intensified tribulation throughout the second age there is no doubt but what the following words of paul applied to the mass of christians wherever they were in the world and in every age hebrews 10 32-38 but called to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated he endured a great fight of afflictions partly whilst you were made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst you became companions of them that were so used for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him the mere association of kind-hearted people with the true believer might well bring death in return for their kindness now the lord god almighty says i know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says i know your tribulation i am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like israel they wonder if god really loves them how can god be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that is what they asked in malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you saith the lord yet we say wherein hast thou loved us was not esau jacob's brother saith the lord yet i loved jacob and i hated esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but god said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation because god hath chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in us job 23 6b you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered hebrews 5 8 through 9. though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this james 1 2-4 my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing why does he stand by the reason is in romans 8 17 through 18 and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what peter said is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god hebrews 12 6 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth but if ye be without chastisement whereof we are all partakers then are ye bastards and not sons now this special condition in smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of god this is the will of god it is needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it love suffereth long and is kind matthew 5 11-12 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass i know thy poverty but thou are rich there it is again see him walking up and down in the midst of his church like a father he is looking down upon his family he is the head of his household he is the provider he is the protector yet he looks on at their poverty oh how the untutored believer stumbles at this how can god bear to look upon his own in a time of need and not just stop it all just give in and lavish everything material upon them here is where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of god this too is needful remember he admonished take no thought for the morrow what you shall eat or what ye shall put on your father knoweth the things ye have need of he who clothes the lily and feeds the sparrow shall do much more for you these physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life for a man's life consistent not of the things he possesses but rather seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all material necessities will be added unto you the people of god are not material minded they are christ-minded they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above it is absolutely true the majority of christians are not wealthy rather they are on the poor side it was so in jesus day it was true in paul's day and it should be true today oh it is not too true today for the laodicean age is one of vast wealth where often the criterion of spirituality is an abundance of earthly goods my how rich the church is in goods but how poor in spirit blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is not meat and drink it is not material it is within us a rich man is rich in god not in worldly things oh christ the spirit i see your poverty i see your need you haven't very much of anything to boast of what you did have has been taken from you you gladly gave up your possessions in exchange for eternal ones you are laughed at you are scorned you don't have material resources to fall back on but you are rich in spite of it all your security lies in him who is your shield an exceeding great reward your kingdom is yet to come but it will come and it will be an everlasting one yes i am mindful of your trials and woes i know how hard it is to get along but i will remember all this when i return to claim you as my own and then i will reward you now this is nothing against rich people because god can save a rich man some of god's children are rich but money can be such a snare not only to those who have it but to those who don't have it way back there in the first age james cried out to those who were putting stock in wealthy people have not the faith of our lord jesus christ with respect of persons the poor there were trying to butter up the rich in order to get help rather than trusting in god don't do it says james don't do it money isn't everything money isn't the answer and today it is not the answer either we have more wealth than we have ever had and yet less is being accomplished spiritually it is not with money that god works he moves by his spirit and that moving of the spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the word the synagogue [Music] you
