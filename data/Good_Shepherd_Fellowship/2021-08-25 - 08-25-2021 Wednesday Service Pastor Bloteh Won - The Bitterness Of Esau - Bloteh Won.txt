the lord for giving us this time that we can be able to lift our voices to the lord in thanksgiving and praise and uh thank you musician that will be it for the singing for now if the lord bless the service will water the world with praise amen let's take our bibles we want to do something tonight and believing that the lord will bless it praise the lord amen amen praise the lord amen let's go to hebrew chapter 12. let's go to hebrew chapter 12. i told you i said when we get down on on some of this rabbit trail it's hard to live from there amen we start looking into uh birthright on sunday and then they took us around esa and jacob and we read the uh the scripture where paul there in romans quoted shake up a love e so i hate and it's it's hard to get off of such a subject so we will we will be doing we will be dealing with that we will want to use tonight and see if the lord will help us to be able to establish uh how how came it there because when the when the angels spoke to rebecca the angel never mentioned anything about jacob i love and esau i hate the injure on the touhou you have two nations in your womb the younger one the older one will save the younger one but then down through the ages uh malachi was the first one that mentioned that jacob i love iso ahead and and in the context that malachi mentioned that he was he was talking about israel questioning his love israel questioning his love it is very very uh interesting when we when we get down to the subject to to uh uh but you will realize that you know there in genesis and then all the way down here in in in malachi we see the prophet malaca bringing it there so it shows that the holy spirit was dealing with that subject as it you know as it progressed so we want to look at hebrew chapter 12 tonight so i won't keep you standing i kept you standing all through the time of praying and if you could stand that was that was good and i want to keep you all through the time of preaching praise the lord if you choose to stand and i will say amen let me take let me take uh verse 12 just just for the just for the a scripture reading verse 12 hebrew 12 12 and uh uh praise the lord verse four wherefore lift up hands which hang down [Music] and the feeble knees and and make straight path for your feet least that which is lame is turn out of the way but let it rather be healed instead of strailing god want us to be healed amen instead of walking contrary to his word he want us walk in the light and more we unfold amen as he's in the light follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see god looking diligently least any man feel of the grace of god leaves any root of bitterness sprinking up trouble you listen to these words as from god not as from me amen looking diligent at least any man fail of the grace of god leaves any root of bitterness sprinking up trouble you and thereby many be defined praise the lord i will come back to them least there be any fornicator or profane person as easter wu for a morsel of meat saw his birthright for you know how that after all when he will have inherited the blessing he was rejected now i taught jacob's toy his blessing praise the lord but this is after calvary when god located through the blood jacob never stole he was rejected you can be you can be stuck in your old testament brain and says jacob's toe is a blessing but when it comes through the blood when god looks at it jacob never stole he was rejected because he was a profane person for you know that after war when he would have inherit inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears let us pray father please help me tonight lord as our brother prayed oh god is his many attire lord i've identified with that and and so that's what i need your help precious lord and we so grateful to be in your house tonight we we thank you for the privilege that we can pass the pages of the bible and read carefully read the words that are written there on one of these days it will all be four memories precious lord when the church comes honor is pressure oh no it's time of trying many of these things that we read now and have been preached to us the holy spirit will have to bring it back to our mind but lord until that time we want to enjoy the privilege of reading your word and to thank you for it we pray that you bless the service tonight once again those that are following the service online we ask that you bless them those that are not able to be with us we also pray and ask that you bless them we are grateful father very grateful in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you can have your seat tonight you know so i was i was looking into this subject of uh uh you know jacob i love israel i hate and and i'm telling you is uh is uh is more than just a verse in the bible it's more than just a verse in the bible so i was i was kind of studying looking out of there tonight and and i got i got in uh there to the office office and you know and just and just tried to to uh just look at some few things before i uh came up here tonight i had a scripture in my mind the root of bitterness so because because i was i was going to deal with with ether tonight and how he got to that place honor what did the holy spirit describe his actions for his to state that god hit easter praise the lord i was i was listening to hello preacher and he was talking about you know there's there's uh there's a preacher that was teaching on this subject and one young man came to him and said i i'm having a serious problem preacher i forget the the brother name now he says i have a serious problem the preacher said yeah what he said he says i can bear the thought of thinking of god hitting the man it troubles me he said well i'm right there with you i have a serious problem too and my problem is i'm trouble with the fact that god can love a man i'm trouble with the fact that god can love a mortal man born in sin shipley in iniquity so you see they were they were both on different side of the fence we were not going to there tonight what i want what i want for us to to deal with is something that uh when you study many uh uh scholars who call it the the everlasting history is uh uh i mean you you talk about everlasting you talk about hatred it kind of troubles your mind but you have to know everlasting is a period of time it means forever and ever but yet it has an end it's different from intended hatred is not intended amen hatred can be everlasting it can be it can be longer than you then you won't want to keep it but uh you know uh it's it's not everlasting so i i was kind of uh looking into that you know studying and uh you know i discovered that many of the scholars look at that and uh we we would just we would just trust tonight and see how the law would help us but i want to go back you know i want to go back to uh a a little time of uh of uh history we want to go back and look look in the life of of easter we we did a little bit with that and and uh so we want to pray that lord will be able to help us tonight praise the lord amen glory be to god so but then when i got in the office just like i was saying i almost lose my thought just like i was saying when i got in the office and i says well i mean this scripture just been hanging on my head since last night i was actually standing on this last night and i mean i came came from from work that the kids were over to the entry place so i just went straight into the room because since sunday i'm telling you the president that was in this building uh i mean was was dealing with me all through the week i just couldn't get away from some things as as tired as my body was but uh uh i it was good and so i went i just went straight into my little my my my my hiding place and i saw that and started looking at this because there was no way i could i could get away from it so but then when i when i try to look at the scripture i says i notice over in the book of hebrews somewhere there and i look it up and then i see how it's connected to to to easter you know how it's connected to esa just just the next verse before the bible paul there talks about easter and his situation let's look at that again god bless you brother d.a go to have brother dda with us amen amen uh some of us will remember him some would not but did he pass here uh was that five years ago five years ago he spent some time with us here then and went over to portland maine where he is now and but we have we have kept in good contact uh uh he's a he's a very very very good friend of mine praise the lord and a good good good friend of mine we we keep in contact and you know he he told me in there he says he says brother won't i choose you to be my pastor i say well okay i'll find somebody to take care of you until you come back praise the lord but he's uh we've been we've been good and he's he's kind of a stuck today he seems to be stubborn with that but the grace of god has has helped us alone amen he's been praise the lord but let's go back to that again uh uh that's that's fine right in verse verse 15. but just just just follow follow follow the way the holy spirit is bringing these things slowly and you know paul from verse 1 started talking about cloud of witnesses he gets down he starts talking about triers and talking about rebuking chastening and he goes down and and then he comes here to this place in in in in the in the scripture where he's talking verse 14 follow peace with all men amen follow peace with all men now uh it's it's almost like we we are in a china because we're dealing with israel now so we are in a china okay the holy spirit is is going to come up here and talk about easter and in his situation but paul uh through the holy spirit now is preparing us for that so he said follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently least any man fill of the grace of god praise the lord least any root of bitterness sprinking up trouble you and thereby many be defined praise the lord so bitterness can actually corrupt you to sin bitterness can lead you to fornication it can lead you to adultery praise the lord just hovering bitterness it can lead you to filthiness it can expose you to some of the horrible things the spirit of bitterness can lead you to pornography and all of that it's a terrible thing this enemy root of bitterness spring up sprinkling up trouble you and thereby many be defined at least there be enem fornicator so you see he's he's tying it i'm not just saying these things but i'm trying to put it in in in you know in perspective so you can be able to see how how the holy spirit what the holy spirit is dying paul is not just saying things because he want to say it he's on the an inspiration of the holy spirit at least there be any fornicator or profane person praise the lord but he start up to say follow peace strive to be peaceful with all men and all that you can do strive to be peaceful jesus says when he hits you on this cheek turn the other one praise the lord it is easy for you to just turn around and get away from there then for you to turn the other one for them to slap you you know you won't do that so it's easy to just turn the other way and go strive for the for the spirit of peace with all men holiness he says least there be any fornicator or profane person as easter as easter you go back to the third of of genesis i mean isa was not even married at that time he was not married he said that paul is saying that israel was living in fornication no that's not what paul is saying paul is bringing us to the place to realize that something contaminated the spirit of israel and that thing was bitterness bitterness contaminated the spirit and then and then paul now he's helping us the same one that said we have cloud of witnesses around us which means being a prophet he could look beyond the mortal reign now he's helping us tonight for us to be able to see how god look at the spirit of bitterness you might have never uh uh uh have fornication or live wrong or or you know go into any kind of a sexual life but if you have the spirit of bitterness in you it's almost like brother branham says he says the spirit of organization he said the same spirit that will bring people to organize he says is the same spirit that will make a man a young man to live in fornication and a married man to live in adultery they are prophets prophets deal with spirits prophets live most of their life in a spirit realm than in the natural realm are we together have your way tonight lord least there be any fornicator or profane person as easier who fought a morsel of meat saw his breath right for a muscle of meat why is the holy spirit tying that act of a man that is hungry praise the lord why is the holy spirit tying that to a profane person why is the holy spirit tying that to unclean living because the the the spirit that was on him is the same spirit that put young people in the street to do prostitution just for little or no money it's the same spirit that will makes a man to break the word of god just for a little sense of pleasure so you see this thing runs deep it runs deep and we will pray that the lord will be able to help us but what i want to deal with here tonight uh like i said if if we go back we want to look at a little bit of history tonight if the law will help us and then uh whatever you know the grace of god will be able to to uh lead us we will go from there so as we look at this we'll realize the other as paul has set this place for us he's helping us to see that easter god bitterness in him he got bitterness in him have i'm having a lot of scriptures before me i'm trying to just collect myself together now but if we go back a little bit if we go back if we want to do justice today so go back and look at easter because what we would drive to here is that uh the scripture right there in genesis chapter 25 when it talks about easter taking the polish the bible says and there his name was called edom and then down in the in the in the scripture you realize there was a people called the and those came from easter right praise the lord but let's go back to father abraham abraham actually had three women in his life one was sarah the mother of isaac the son of the promise praise the lord the second woman was heger she's the mother of ishmael praise the lord and then when sarah died abraham mary keturah and keturah had six sons praise the lord now so we have we have isaac we have ishmael we have the sixth sons of keturah but you'll realize here out of isaac came ether and jacob okay out of ishmael came the ishmael actually had he had 12 sons and uh came the ishmaelites and then out of the six sons of keturah came the arabians where we presently have today saudi arabia praise the lord every nation in modern history that now endured around israel came from these sons of ishmael and the sons of keturah praise the lord so then in genesis 25 verse 30 that was where the uh the first time that uh edom was used from jacob because of the rareness of the soup so there in the scripture you you realize that uh the land of seer s e i arrow and edom they always have you know relations okay and i'm just i'm trying to to lay out some things here so uh uh i mean we we can be able to establish our tasks together now uh in genesis chapter 28 verse 9 if we look there in genesis chapter 28 i'm kind of struggling a little bit to stick to my mind my notes here or as i'll be all over the place verse nine then went easter to ishmael and took and talked onto and took on to the wives which he hired mahala the daughter of ishmael abraham's son the sister of [Music] if i pronounce it right or wrong to be wife but where is this stop going ishmael i mean easter is now going to emerge with the with the uh ishmael nights and and pretty soon as as we will look through the scripture because the the wonderful thing about it there is that the word that this bible recorded all the nations that is recorded in the bible state exists it's just that with history and walls their name did change you know as children you read the bible and you read about this nation it looks like it was a word that existed before and that word did god destroy is the very same word that we are living in today amen now so uh uh as as we look at this we're going to see that easter out of bitterness he called mega himself with the ishmaelites and pretty soon they were all co-mingle together that's the reason why now people from that region are all called arabs but biblically they are now all arabs among them they are the they are the the the the they are the the ishmaelites and they are the arabs praise the lord but because they have cold meager as we look through the scripture and uh i i bring some other things to you from from the prophet but that nat nat i want to just kind of uh do it on on history yet a little bit so we realized that uh uh edom is to the southeast of the dead sea and yeah the southeast of the dead sea and right there we realized the other uh it is stand to the both side of the uh the arabians and it connects itself to the dead and the red sea so all that area that's where you find this group of people but they they all call me together now because what you were you from all of these you will now understand the lasting history of all the nations around israel while they hit israel are we together because what we're trying to to deal with here is the bitterness of easter give birth to the history and the wall in palestine praise the lord amen and as we travel together you will realize that this would take us to god and my god that's what bitterness will do but let me let me share something with you i was i was talking i was talking to uh to some young people and uh and and and the holy spirit just helped me say this thing and i left from there being blessed i don't know if they were blessed but i left from there being blessed [Laughter] praise the lord you see in the scripture joseph his brother hated him amen his brother saw him to the egyptians but you see the way joseph dead with what his brother did he never allowed bitterness to enter his heart and because he did not have bitterness there was no room to revenge what makes a person to revenge is bitterness [Music] are we together yes joseph here for no reason he can't even understand it at first he thought his brothers were joking they put him down down the hall and then he's uh he's help me help me nobody is coming stinky okay i don't know what i've done i'm sorry whatever i've done i'm sorry in his mind he's thinking that they would get over it and it would come and take me out praise the lord and he's standing right there his brother's standing there and he see them taking money from these uh from these uh uh meetings or whoever group they are taking money from them and the man carrying him he's looking at his brothers samia help he's looking at his brothers and they put him on the wagon and he's he's looking behind and his brothers are fading from his eyes as the chair keeps going he cried and he cried and he cried he couldn't understand why they did it to him so he never put no meaning the thing that makes you to keep things is because you put meaning to it [Music] i don't understand why they did this to me if you don't understand it leave it i don't understand why they don't like me but i think you already have a reason why they don't like you you already establish a reason why they don't like you maybe it's because maybe it's because and as you settle down with that thought in your mind then you start to plot with that thought right you start mixing your own person you start mixing it in your mind and you mixing and you start cooking it together the very thing that is going to kill you when i get back i'm going to show myself to them i don't even care about them and then you go on and you go on you're just cooking that thing in yourself i will show them they think i'm stupid and you just keep cooking it praise the lord if you were cooking it in somebody's heart it would be better you cooking it in your own heart and jacob joseph went away and he kept thinking about it wow why they did this oh man and he cried and he cried he missed his father he missed his brothers he still missed him sure he still missed him and because he could not make sense of why they hated him there was no way for him to establish revenge in his heart oh he was hoping that one day he would see them one day he would go back in and see them maybe i mean i said young man i was sitting i was asking why you had to treat me like that why you did this to me the y was just there sure praise the lord but as as he went on and as he grew and as the lord was dealing with him instead of the brothers giving him an answer god gave him an answer right yes he said you meant it for evil but the lord turned it out to be good [Laughter] oh man praise the lord amen but then it's a complete opposite this is easy that came to his brother and he said look i'm dying give me this food yep i mean it is breath right you can have it if that's all you want praise the lord but then when he came back going to make the search for his father when he came back in in in and realized that his dad has blessed easter i mean has blessed jacob yeah my goodness he says you took my breath right and you took my blessing again i would kill this boy and you see what happened is that he got so mad so angry what brother balaam says anger is nesto insanity when you get angry you lose your mind he got so angry until he turned the anger against his own parents that he would not listen to the advice they shouldn't tell him where to get married and who to get marital you see the parents never did anything to him right but you see their anger and that bitterness make him now to be more off a white man he can turn it on anybody praise the lord have you ever experienced that just coming from in a in a rough talk you're not happy and someone say hi yeah hi what did that person do innocent person it's because your spirit is is cooking in that anger there's no way to put up a smile what's happening nothing praise the lord so he turned the anger on his parents he would not listen to them he was he was he was you know very mad he decided to travel down go down to the ishmaelites and get his wife live any way he want he really now became a wild man but problem there is that he was dealing with bitterness and with that bitterness in his heart there were a lot of profane things that came to his mind when i grabbed that boy i would kill him i would kill his children i would kill his wife he wouldn't have a grave i mean over and over every night he slept with that thing in his mind every night he came out with a new plan praise the lord he never only had a root of bitterness he had a tree because it brought forth a nation called edom that hated israel it affected other nations until today till because the day is almost almost until tomorrow is still putting our fruits are we together now pretty soon you will soon learn to start understanding what god hate what was it that god hate are we together praise the lord now so we realize here the so as as uh as the nations went by let's look a few scriptures tonight like i said i'm trying to lay the foundation here you realize in numbers chapter 20 in numbers chapter 20 uh maybe you can write them down uh edom refused israel's passage when they were on the adjoining refuse you see many years back i remember preaching a message called generation conflict and i took that message from the statement that a woman that aware made when she said our father told us praise the lord our fathers taught us things that was that i said from the parents to the children sometimes it takes the parents conflict down and the next generation passed that conflict down to the next generation those people that were mean to our father and just that one word would breed rebellion in the children against those people even refused passage to israel is there in numbers chapter 20. but yet over in deuteronomy chapter 23 god forbid israel to i help edom and god says they are your brothers praise the lord in numbers chapter 24 balaam he predicted that edom will be conquered in joshua chapter 15 god told joshua that he must not encroach on the land of the now see see this thing so you realize here that god is dealing with this thing in a completely different way if you just take it in a kind of knowledge of god hit easter you're going to get you you will get the whole picture wrong praise the lord amen because just like i said there is nowhere there in genesis chapter 25 that the angel told rebecca anything about god hitting easter sure and here we said all down here god is still protecting those people telling joshua don't even crush upon their land they are your brothers but yet edom is now being the brother to israel they are finding ways after wins to still fight against israel second chronicle chapter 20 the joined the moabites and it read against judah and you can go on and on and on and on it will surprise you when you study to realize that herald the king that all of the babies to be killed that he was an edomite herald the king because it was another hero that ordered the head of john the baptist to be cut off he was an edomite praise the lord and if you are you said it also herald the king honorables jesus was crucified he was also an evil might you see that's the reason why in the scripture talking about herald you remember how jesus distraught him go tell that fox so you see there's there is there is a lot of things that uh you know that that there is a lot of things that constitute all to this scripture to that verse i don't want to i don't want to pass my page but uh you know just to see that it was his own fault praise the lord amen you know it is not just for the fact that that uh uh [Music] uh isa was hungry it is it is it is the fact that the thought that runs with that is the idea of a person that feels that they can get whatever they want when they want it how the one whatever the one that can get it he wanted he wanted the food he could get it that kind of for that kind of attitude when a person feels that they can get whatever they want however they want it they can get it it's all of those things that comes to it and that is a prosperity as we'll soon discover it's all tied to it praise the lord but tonight for this prayer meeting as we have poured our house before god thanking god we want to use this time and endure on bitterness that became the soul problem of edom hovering unforgiving spirit became the sole problem of essa oh may god search us tonight praise the lord may god search us tonight you realize that most of our spiritual struggle is because we are stuck somewhere in our spirit man follow peace with all men and that peace will bring you holiness unto god you want the holy ghost follow peace with all me that was the root cause of isa problem the bible says he despised the breath right he care less about it but yeah when he realized that his brother talked to birthright he was not happy it was not like he did not care about it in a sense the other he never wanted it does not mean anything to him but it's just that attitude of thinking that i can get whatever i want any way i want it praise the lord that you can even disperse your health you can despise time you can despise god you can just because whatever you want you set your mind on it i can get it it is that kind of a spirit kind of a driving spirit that was in easter and nobody can tell me anything different sure oh my god be merciful and may he help us praise the lord in rebellion he called maker himself praise the lord yes if you even read the scripture you will see how yeah i mean even his parents mother tried to talk to him is there no other women somewhere i mean he didn't care it was not his problem that thing was eating him up he was trying to gain forces that when he's a return i would pay back praise the lord but you realize with joseph all the things that he was doing from from the fact that he identified his brothers everything that he was doing to them was to hide his identity he was not doing it to them in revenge because he was he was just at the edge to reveal himself he was shaking he knew that this was these guys were his blood right least the least mistake he made he knows that they will realize there is something different about this man so he kept doing things just to hide his identity right but there was now one root of bitterness in him because of how he did with the rejection he said you meant it for evil but god turn it out for god praise the lord when he came back the next time just like the scripture we read on sunday he brought them on the table they sat down he gave them the best place to sleep when he even had one of his brothers so they can go and bring uh benjamin back when they all came back and that brother starts to tell them gentlemen i really enjoy my state if the hard present is i really want to be in prison people were feeling me in the morning they brought clothes for me to word i'm in the air-conditioned room oh my goodness egyptian praising is that really where prison is i mean before they came back this god cheek was sticking out praise the lord so you can see there was there was now one root of bitterness jacob joseph was just doing all of those things just to hide his identity waiting for benjamin waiting for little benjamin to appear before he can show himself praise the lord when he saw little benjamin that she had the same wound with him he could not hold himself the bible said he went behind the curtain and he cried he never cried out of vestation or out of anger it was a tear of joy because in his mind he says oh my brothers lord thank you you kept them safe is your father still alive the lord and because he did with that matter god bless him because he gathered his heart that no root of bitterness would enter god protected him he was not raising money so he can bring an army and goes kill those men and their children right search me oh god in all my heart today praise the lord search me oh god and all my heart today i'll say something tonight oh god be merciful praise the lord just help us lord just help us what a girl we serve his ways our paths finding out amen god's ways are past finding out that's the reason why the scripture says he searched the range and the heart he's looking in your heart amen he's all caring about how you are dealing with your situation in your heart what a god we self praise the lord are we together tonight amen amen oh praise the lord jesus thank you father thank you lord i'll look in at a scripture this uh yesterday evening i might share that with you on sunday and jeremiah deals with that jeremiah called out seven nations in the book of jeremiah and all of those nations that jeremiah called out the uh state presence nations that are all around israel and god mentioned them one by one that he was going to deal with him and mention what they did to to israel god remember they are wrong the the uh the hatred towards israel praise the lord amen as we stand together you will realize that we all know that that god is the great fountain of love amen and actually there is no hate in god praise the lord as also he's the great holy god there is no evil in him but yet the scripture says an evil spirit from the lord when and anoint those prophets they have prophets solomon said this in proverbs chapter four verse 23 keep the heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life whatever you keep in your heart we live because your heart like brother branham said in spoken word is the original seed he said the heart is a womb it's a womb just like how a child lives in the womb that's how whatever you keep in your heart we live praise the lord and if you don't mind whatever you keep in your heart my life longer than you praise the lord am i live longer than you depending on what it is it might even have to kill you and live on because it's a spirit the heart is warm oh may the holy spirit just search our house tonight he just search our hearts and know our thoughts praise the lord search our hearts lord and know our thoughts time
