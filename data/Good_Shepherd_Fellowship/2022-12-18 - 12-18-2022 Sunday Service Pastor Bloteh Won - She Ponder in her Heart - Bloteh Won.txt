[Music] a the word to be born amen [Music] then I know they can't be born in you and me and she kept this thing and upon the bear with faith she believed in God when he says something new was glory to you and made the world to be born amen and I know they can be born and you and me yes and she kept these things and on the bed thee with her she believes in God when he says something new was going to start amen [Music] then I know they can be born in you and listen on our feet as we continue to sing and she kept these things and fond of them leave within our hearts she believed in God when he says something new was going to start ever [Music] one more time now and she kept these things and from the bed she believed in God when he says something new was going to start oh in the world to be born amen I know they can't be born in you if the world could be born and Mary yeah in the world be born in me I know that he can be born in you if the world could be born and married oh if the word to be

be it all all that just sing it to the Lord now yes be unto me I call into you calling to your promises I can't stand said oh yeah [Music] is true that sets me free calling to your word O Lord being that was merry confession to the angel oh yes to me calling to the world oh I call it you your promises [Applause] it's true that sets be free falling to your word O Lord it all to me Hallelujah praise the Lord let's turn to the book of sin Luke thank you musicians let's turn to the book of Saint Luke it's in Luke Chapter 2 I want to take a little thought here for a Christmas message if we want to call it a Christmas message we know Christmas to the believer is is worship amen praise the Lord and I go into all of the the hidden things that are produced around Christmas we already know it's not Christmas or Christmas in the Bible we know all of that we know the history but yet we will say Merry Christmas to you amen praise the Lord so say Luke Chapter 2 let's read from verse 8. and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their floor and Lord the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone around about them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them feared for behold I bring you Good Tidings of great joy we shall be to all people are you part of those people this morning amen For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be assigned unto you now the angel is speaking to the Shepherds on the field the angel never went to the priest in the temple the angel never went to Herald the angel is speaking to those Shepherds that are on the field and they shall be assigned unto you ye shall find the Babe wrapped in sweating cloth line in the manger and and suddenly there was wave the angel and multitude of heavenly host praising God and and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will tow us men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us now go even onto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the Lord have made known unto us I'm reading him something going through my mind that's what I'm kind of for stuttering and they came in in his and found married and Joseph and the baby lion in the manger and when they have seen a they may known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard a wander at those things which were told them by the shipper but Mary kept these things and she pondered them in her heart that's why we were singing that chorus as I was thinking about the scripture that song keep playing through my mind and I was hoping that I get it right this time amen but Mary kept those uh all these things and she pondered them in her heart praise the Lord why did she pondered him why did she Ponder are the things that the Shepherds were saying because those were the very same thing that the angel told her the Bible says when the angel said it all those that heard it they wandered it was strange to them but to Mary it was like a Vindication it was like a re-eco so she pondered had those things let us pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus it was just not a song this morning Lord but if it was our confession the word could be born and married thou word that the angel said a virgin shall conceive unto us a child is born and unto us the son is giving father thou word Lord was birthed by Mary and there's a word that is promised to this age of God the father is going to be a bride Lord there's a word that is promised to this age that there's going to be a rapture father there is there's a word that is promised to this age Lord that this is the age of the manifestation of the sons and the daughters of God if that word concerning the the Virgin giving birth could be born in Mary Lord father we certainly believe Lord that the promises for this day can be birthed through US Lord oh God we are not father going to bring Lord a baby in the manger we are going to bring a mentor Christ it's no longer the baby wrap in the manger Lord this is Christ that will be birth in US father we pray that God you will bless us this morning I would just want to pray for strengthening and just pray that God you will just help me this morning Father in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed while you sit there and follow the word be be praying for me and uh I need I need a little help this morning amen I need the Lord help praise the Lord it's easy to slip away from from preaching and just get into teaching this morning but I'm hoping that to keep you long because I can't stand very long amen praise the Lord amen let me read something here from the message unveiling of God let me read something from the message unveiling of God but before we do that let's go to the Book of Matthew let's go to the Book of Matthew oh I I will allow you to read it I would allow you to get back home and read it um really need your help Lord but what I wanted to read what I wanted to point you back to Matthew is there too uh the Shepherds got to see the Lord Jesus before the wise man praise the Lord because the very night there the Lord Jesus was born there was when the angel appeared unto the Shepherds that was the same time the wise men saw the star but it took the wise men two years to travel down to see the baby that's the reason why over in Matthew Herald had to kill children from two years or down because Hera was he was going off of uh what the wise men said to him when they saw the star they related everything so hero was was working on that information so when the wise man came Jesus was a little child when the Shepherds got there Jesus was a little baby praise the Lord so I just I just wanted to bring that to you so you uh we will we will realize that we're not we're not going to do it a whole lot on the manger we want to go in a different direction we want to talk to ourselves because just like I was I said we we also have a promise to be able to birth Christ in this day amen that is the purpose of the church now so let's let's take uh something here from uh on villain of God if uh if the the technicians are ready to put my praise the Lord now now uh Birdman preaching that message unveiling of God he said now my subject this morning I trust that God will reveal this and each time if you will take the tips and listing follow this now I hope and trust that you you have had a spiritual understanding of what God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out praise the Lord you mean that God can be saying something to you without saying it directly that's the reason why over and over in the Bible in the Book of Revelation he said he that has an ear let he hear what the spirit is saying to the church praise the Lord and I believe that God is now referring to our little two antenna on our hands I believe he's referring to uh uh being able to hear what is not set out literally praise the Lord Jesus said except you know except the people eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood they have no life and and they'll stumble the people you know so it's it's all through the scripture you see how God speaks to Moses and he he will say things to Moses you know I want to make you a kingdom of priests you know what you are you you are a peculiar people to me and he's saying all of those things and yet he's asking the people if you would keep my Commandments and do those ordinances that I have given to you now so uh in in in in some way they could put a conflict in the in the mind of a reason or in the mind of someone with a kind of mind they would think that this they sound confusing God is saying one thing but we realize that like I've always said God language is what the spirit said his language is not English it's not French it's not German it's not Spanish amen so let's read this as we go ahead again and each one if you would take the tips and listing and I hope I trust that you will have a spiritual understanding of what that God has been trying to say it over to the church without saying it right out see it is it's a thing sometimes we have to say things in in such a way that it might thin down it might bring some to go out some to leave and some to ponder some to ponder over praise the Lord amen now I would think that it will be uh uh uh you know it would be uh not a good thing if if things are said purposely to make people to feedback but you see yeah uh truth you know truth is not defined by what we think truth is because truth is not only what a man said it's true truth Jesus make us realize that truth is a person I am the way the truth and the life amen praise the Lord so you see sometimes things are safe out of the scripture things I said sometimes God will say his truth I mean it was truth that God told Jeremiah that the people will be going into captivity for 70 years you see it's something that came back all the way from the book of uh uh numbers and when you study back there uh when God brought the people out of the land of Egypt he told them that assist this you can work in the seventh day you must rest praise the Lord he placed that also in the Lord of redemption there was a year called The Jubilee year where a person can can can give out their land and then because actually in Israel then we're not sold you know the land belongs to the Lord so if a person will lease the lane like we were saying and then at the time of the Jubilee the land will return back to its owner now so also we we see that God told the children of Israel they had their Harvest time I mean they are planting season and he told them that you can be able to sow the land you can tell the land you can work with the land but you must give the land a rest after every seven years but what happened was when the people came into the promised land they never did that they never gave the land its rest praise the Lord and let me tell you you have a land this body you must give it rest praise the Lord amen I'm not putting you on the seventh year or the seven day rest but I'm just I'm just trying to to grab your attention this morning Jesus said all you that labor and have the heavy lady come unto me and I will give you rest we know the rest of the believer is the Holy Ghost amen that is the rest that is the spiritual rest to the believer but beyond that our bodies need rest I would just throw that out there and then you figure it out so because the people never give the land rest for all of those years God was going to claim rest from them that was the actual purpose behind the 70 year captivity in Babylon God was going to claim the rest of the land from the people because the refuse to give the land its rest and now giving the land is rest it went into all different form of a dollar train and different things and uh you know uh putting their children through the fire and different things you read a book of Jeremiah you see the above the whole purpose of the Bible learning captivity was the the disobedient the breaking of God's Sabbath praise the Lord the breaking of God Sabbath so we see that here so uh uh Jeremiah was saying that and and zedekiah the rest of the other priests could not believe it how high can Jeremiah said that we will go into captivity for seven seventy years he says I mean that that's that's unbelievable we are God's people I mean what you are saying is not true I mean Jeremiah was put into praising he was weapon and all of those things so I'm only saying that to come right back to my thought here sometimes things I said from God Amen to team down the crowd you know to get people out and that's how Jesus was able to reduce his crowd when he says eat my flesh and drink my blood and people left and well sometimes things are said for us to ponder over because when you ponder over things it's a way it's it's a kind of a spiritual uh digestive way to be able to take things from your mind for it to resident in your heart praise the Lord because God's purpose of his word is not for us to keep it on our mind the mind is the is is the Battleground amen you want that word to resident in our heart we have to say things in such a way that it might tend down it might bring some to go out some to leave some to ponder over but that don't but that's don't purposely it must be done that way then it might be that there are some who say you mean God will purposely do a thing like that just like the Jeremiah example that I gave you in different example in the scripture you mean God will purposely that's the reason why the people could not easily believe Noah's message that God will destroy the word and only save you and your boat are you telling us that God will destroy the entire world only you and your animal on the boat how can you reason there out how can you reason it out praise the Lord now they might be gone there are some will say you mean that God will purposely do a thing like that he said in the day he does here today he said one day uh uh he had a thousand around him okay that gave that example except you eat my eat the Flesh of the son of man the Son of God the son of man who drink his blood you have no life in you so we we uh we want to take that little uh version in the in the in the in the in Luke Chapter 2 where we read verse 19. but Mary kept all of those things and she pondered them in her heart praise the Lord amen she pondered them in her heart and just like I said the reason why she pondered over those things is because all of those things that the Shepherds were saying were the very thing that they injure to her praise the Lord don't you feel good when you read the Bible and you see the law ministering something to you and then the Shepherd come and said the Shepherd come and saved from the back of the pocket it makes you to ponder law where you're in my kitchen were you in my bedroom listening to me praise the Lord that's exactly what was happening to Mary here amen and now you will realize that it was the same angel that spoke to Mary that was the same angel that spoke to those Shepherds it was the same angel that came down and spoke to Joseph woke him up and say Joe don't put this woman away what is happening to her is of the Holy Ghost it was the same angel that spoke to Zacharias praise the Lord amen so it was a season where the angel was in the neighborhood the angel was in the area he was he was visiting those people in the area uh you know visited uh um Zacharias concerning his wife Elizabeth and I I was thinking how to be able to make a transition talking about uh the subject we were talking about the Barons Rejoice into what we we will be talking about this morning so I'm really praying that the Lord will be able to help me amen and saw the angel visited the Zacharias and and make him to know that his wife was going to have a child that was the angel Gabriel that same injured was the angel that met uh uh uh Mary uh the well and uh and the angel told Mary you're cursing Elizabeth is also expecting a child now the angel did that for a reason because Elizabeth has passed the age of childbirth so now you have to remember now the angel told Mary that the Holy Ghost will overshadow you Mary said how would this thing happen what an interruption I don't know how many weeks or or it was to her wedding the angel comes right in there then interrupt the whole wedding plan and and Yaris says she's going to be a child and uh uh and the Holy Spirit I mean the angel is telling her that the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you but the angel how to tell her that Elizabeth you're cursing is also expecting just to be able to to bring up her faith that she that was called barren amen she that was called Byron is also expecting so in in another sense the angel was trying to make Mary to realize that I'm not only dealing with you I'm also dealing with Elizabeth amen praise the Lord you are coming honor a promise but I'm also dealing with Elizabeth praise the Lord amen so we see that uh uh uh I mean it's just beautiful in the scripture it's beautiful in the scripture to see the ones that and here is it also that the angel visited uh uh this all uh priest in the temple amen the angel visited him so you see there there was a small group of people and maybe about eight and I can count them with my finger there's there's John and Elizabeth John had a visitation Elizabeth had the experience of the child and uh married and Joseph and then Hannah and and uh uh Simon Simeon in the temple also were visited by the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost told him that you would not die until you see the law of Christ praise the Lord and uh and then also the shepherd so almost about uh seven or eight people there they had a small group of people now and this was a major thing that was happening in the world this was a junction of time this was a a a a a a breach in God's Own history but yet it was just a few few people the hardest experience and it was not just like uh you know they were convincing themselves they were telling themselves they actually had an experience praise the Lord when they have gone years and years and years with no uh uh no visitation just like it was in the time of Samia the Bible said there was no open vision do you know what it was to come out and say an angel told me an angel told me that my wife Elizabeth will have a child praise the Lord even even Zechariah struggle over accepting it then just say okay because you you can say Amen your mouth will be close until the child comes instead of you saying amen you can't say Amen to the word your mouth will be close because it was something that had never happened in history praise the Lord they have read it in the Bible I mean happy India time they have read it in the scripture like better bam said he had a lot of examples there he had the example of Sarah he had the example of Rachel he had all of those examples right there but because the word has just become a form they have just been saying it they have not had a physical experience they know that God is a provider but they have really never seen God putting a whole sack in their room when the window is locked and the door is like where did this bag pass from they have never seen it praise the Lord but it was a new day it was a new day it was it was uh it was at the junction of time when God when all that was in God's mind as a thought he was about to literally manifest it he was his word was going to be made flesh praise the Lord his word was going to be made flesh you have to remember when God said let us make man in our image and in our likeness praise the Lord I believe in my heart that was worth out of our problems started from because there was no creature that God expressed in making In His Image and in his likeness then when it came to men so we we realize here that go highest form of expression is to be made flesh they are his highest form of expression to be made flesh amen he revealed himself through His prophets God speak through dreams through visions and different things but it's his highest form of expression is to be made flesh and you ever said that God's word was going to be made flesh and a virgin was going to bring forth this body a body without prepare me that is also said in the psalm a body would they are prepared me in heaven is my Throne the Earth is my first two God says there is no place I can do Earth but there will be a body that will be prepared for me and I will step in that body now so all of this promise was coming to pass but yet they were just a few people just a few just a finger finger count not even 10 10 uh a person has had an experience or we can also count the wise men in praise the Lord but it was just few people on the face of the Earth that had an idea of this great thing that was going to happen so you can see here that's the reason why Mary pondered over it that's the reason why she stood there she listened to those uh uh Shepherds talking and it became comforting to her praise the Lord it became comforting to her that she's not deceived it was not just a bad dream or or a kind of for I I don't have a mental problem because the very thing that the angel told me is the same thing that these Shepherds are saying praise the Lord amen so as we will look into this subject this morning uh like I promised you to to be able to go fast I want to I want to go over to uh uh uh spoken word is the Original Seed we're a better Brandon taught us that uh actually we have two spiritual warm whenever the word is preached whenever God speaks to his people we have a womb of our mind that we first receive the word in the mind is a womb praise the Lord amen and and our heart also is a womb so he speaks here and he says spoken word is the Original Seed he says now the word that God speak to multiply and replenish the Earth listen to this now the word when God said he the Bible said he blessed man and says man must uh uh uh uh multiply and replenish the Earth according find a place to learn father that the word caught into the womb of a virgin because when God spoke that word and said man must multiply and replenish the Earth you have to realize that it was it was the spoken word of God praise the Lord amen so if if if if Adam and Eve who have just kept long believing God's word and moving you know in the power and authority they have definitely they were going to bring there will be a time where Adam was going to speak to his wife and says I want sons and daughters and she was going to bring it forth so that's why brother Branham is saying here when God said that that spoken word move on through the Earth amen for the spoken word of God to be able to produce life if for no place to land why because Genesis 3 came in amen Genesis 3 came in were the second uh uh you know uh deceived even and make her to believe that whatever God says you know what you know God is he speaks so deep uh uh uh and and right in there the you know the sex acts were allowed so it was it was that's that's the reason why it becomes a permissive wing and it's only blessed under the marriage covenant amen sex act is only blessed under the marriage covenant so we see here the Alberta Branham says that word is finally finally this were caught into a womb of a virgin a virgin is going to bring forth what God said unto us as son is born unto us a child is born a son is giving a a virgin that word is going to create life praise the Lord that word is going to create life so that's the reason why if Jesus said he that believeth in me will have eternal life it is not when we die before we have it that word that is spoken if you believe it you are a possessor of eternal life while you are in this body praise the Lord while you are in this bother you are a possessor of eternal life now when we die Hallelujah are we together now so the word caught into the womb of a virgin now he goes down he says now there is a womb of the physical there is a womb of the spirit praise the Lord did you believe that there is a spiritual warm and a physical form and the mind is a womb of the spirit Paul days with that in the Book of Romans he talks a whole lot in in their sins now so we see here that uh uh that's that's the place that we want to we want to travel because if we if we say you know if we confess that uh you know uh if the word could be born and married that same word can be born in us then we must have a womb to be able to receive the wording amen we must have a womb to be able to receive the word praise the Lord so that that is the thought that that we we we want to go through this morning praise the Lord now so we have a we have a we have a spiritual warm we have a physical warm there they are too warm we have the more the the womb of the mind and we have the womb of our soul amen he goes down he says the mind is a womb of the spirit what to to take in and let out that's how they they commit adultery now when brother Branham was dealing with this he went he went back to Genesis chapter three that let me let me let me let me just read a little bit and uh and be able to cap ourselves yeah that's how they committed they committed adultery uh let's let's set on Devil's Spirit Port then uh something against the word of God then she committed adulterate Satan hit Eve mine and in the womb of her mind she doubted God's word then comes the the actual art praise the Lord so what brother Branham is dealing with here is that the the the the the the the the the mind of the womb is very important that nothing can affect our body until that seed has been sown in our mind praise the Lord when he saw that seed uh uh in in Eve mind that you will be like God nor in Good and Evil praise the Lord when that seed was sold in her mind and like brother Branham says she stopped for the white and she reasoned on it it weakens the body right praise the Lord when seeds are sold in our mind and and our mind received those seeds then brother Brown says that's how our body now surrounded to the Arts whatever it is whether it is lie lost whatever it is so we realize here that the mind is a very powerful one and the only way that we can ever be born again is first in the womb of the Mind receive the word and then the spirit comes on top of that and bring it there you are praise the Lord amen so we see these two minds and and uh and uh and and and when when uh when the scripture says she ponder over those things she thought about it it was in her mind she was reflecting on listening to those uh Shepherd she was reflecting on what the angel said to her but you see what the angel said to her has already been resident in her heart because yeah she's experiencing a child she has already brought for the child the child is lying there but it's becoming more real to her she's rehearsing in her mind or reminding herself that this is what the angel said praise the Lord now so we see this that uh uh that the church the Bride of Jesus we are just like Mary in uh in in in this state we have a promise for our day praise the Lord what is that promise the son of man being revealed again that's the bride promise so the bride has a promise to be to to to birth Christ again but you see this time it's not going to be uh uh uh a ball that's separated from our body is going to be expressing breath in Christ through your body like Paul who says is no longer I that live but Christ that live any means amen so we're going to bring for Christ this is going to be a bride Christ in bright form but for us to to be able to get to that place you know for us to get to that place we will have to go through the same process of conception praise the Lord amen now that's the reason why we took the type to be able to talk about why God Through the Ages gave Abraham a promise but yet he hired his wife to be Barren for about 25 years give Isaac a promise and and yet Rebecca was was Byron and and and even Jacob a promise and all these Patriot their their wives had to go through through these things now you see this is God saying something without saying it out he's saying it because he allowing it to happen in the life of these women when he already told Abraham that Abraham will become the father of many nations but yet he allowed them to go through a a dry season allow them to go through a Barren period why God does that praise the Lord amen now Genesis chapter 3 the Bible says and God said unto the woman the seed of the woman there are seas shall bruise the head of the serpent and he shall bruise the heat God giving a woman here a promise of redemption that the woman will have a seed in the seed of the woman will become an overcomer the seed of the woman is going to turn history back again the seed of the woman is going to bring them back to that place where God wants a man to be but how many years how long did it took for this seed to come praise the Lord how long God how to raise a people called the Jews and give them the Lord and all of his ordinances just to prepare a bloodline because the Messiah would travel on that bloodline praise the Lord every every the uh uh uh Jewish Guild I was as I was studying last night I came across that I mean last week you know and and that's the reason why uh uh uh child birth was very important to this patriarch because they were all looking to that promise of the seed of the woman now but in their mind is uh they never taught it like the way it happened to Mary they just thought that maybe my child will be that one that will that will that would be the Messiah maybe my child you know so so Rick Richard there you know uh uh uh struggling with Jacob give me children Lisa died so every one of them was looking to that promise but see how many years it took you know how many years it took God promised to have a bride Paul says I expose you to Christ as a church virgin but God had to take his church through Seven Ages the messenger Paul came in a Ephesian Church age and he laid the foundation but the church had to go through seven Church ages and even went through a dark period praise the Lord amen I was I was studying and I came across something that was that was very very beautiful this is Christmas around the time where Jesus was born the the Jews they were at a place where they kept looking for This Promise were oh Jacob said the scepter will not leave Judah until shallow will come there was also a promise that they were looking to the Messiah so just in that time when Jesus was born they had a they had a lot of uh there was a lot of uh both with the sahindrance and uh the the sahindrance that made made of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and all the different groups that was there that was the name of the air on the World Council of churches or the Council of churches among the Jews now so uh they were coming to the conclusion that uh the Romans are now ruling over them but God has made a promise that the scripture was not going to leave Judah so which means God was always going to raise up a king from the time of David God Israel will always have a king but now Yara said that uh they they announced subjecting themselves to a Roman King Herod and and and there is no king in Israel praise the Lord so that was one of the reason why the struggle to believe Jesus as the Messiah because what they did not realize is that uh the the kingship that was coming through David down and Jesus in that lineage too that this their King was going to be the amaziah in their mind they separated the kingship which means they were going to have a king on the throne and during that time a king of Judah and that will be the same time the Messiah would come are you understanding me praise the Lord so how can we talk about a messiah how can we say that he is the Messiah when we don't have a king in Israel the scepter was taken from Judah so which means the prophecy that Jacob prophesied it's incomplete because the shelter will be in Judea there will always be a king on the throne praise the Lord when the Messiah comes so how can you say that this man is the Messiah and we have hero as our King it's broken in the scripture praise the Lord it's kind of a broken in the scripture but you see God's word will never fail now one of his world will be broken because just at the same time where the Messiah will be born because it's a fulfillment of scripture that is that is intertwined because here is the wise man here a true uh uh uh the vision the scene of the stars that they saw in that and you read on that brother Branham will always uh uh uh kind of for relate the Stars to the pillar of fire now so uh with that with the Stars that they saw this wise man is is seen a star that is identifying that a king is born amen this order this or the wise man is seeing the star that is that is identifying that uh you know uh there's there's a seven Bond there is there is one that is born and is going to give his life and and they came with those gifts to be able to identify so right in the gifts of the wise man the King was identified and the Messiah was also identified praise the Lord because I because uh because the the Jews believe that you tell them about the Isaiah 53 they will tell you that that should be the Messiah praise the Lord so in the wise man gift God was able to identify the king line in Judah and God was also able to identify his seven which is the Messiah but yerry is the whole sahindra's Council it was a very big rehistory it was a very big discussion that God has turned his back on us if not this word is broken because we are told that there will be a king there is no way we can prepare for the Messiah until there is a king praise the Lord amen now so you see that's the reason why they can they can they can put the promise up toward the Millennium in because the uh you know the son of David will be only strong they can put the promise up to that time because they believe that there also will be a time where they will have a king on the throne but God have his way to fulfill his word praise the Lord amen in one birth in one birth he's fulfilling both the king of Judah and he's giving them the amazing praise the Lord now so we see here that that is the same thing to the church we have a promise amen we have a promise of the manifestation of the sons of God we have a promise that we will be adopted we have a promise of the Holy Ghost now you see it's easy for you to look at the church and look at the things that is happening around the Church of men that have creeped in on a word according to the scripture they have brought different doctrines to build the accounts and and men that have gotten themselves for wealth and different things that is happening around the church and you and you look at it and you ask yourself is this Rapture thing even truth praise the Lord amen because you see the way the human mind works is the other uh uh uh you know uh we we expect to go from uh uh uh uh you know at Birth we go have our first birthday in our second birthday and you know we we never expect to skip a birthday praise the Lord you never hear the person say I have a promotion in my birthday I was two I was four years from now I'm six praise the lord we expect that but then also it's also out of place where you you can see the life of a young child and you you ask uh what is the age of the child is this or what the child she's she's 80 years old wow she behaved like 12. all she behaved to make sure for her age praise the Lord what what brings that experience is because you know what a nine year old should do you in your mind you know the way that a nine year old or the 10 year old should behave but now to to be able to associate the behavior of the child with the age about for you praise the Lord amen I'm coming to something insane there now so you see that uh uh when you when we look at all of the things that the church have gone through you even look into the ages let's leave laodisha for now but you look into the ages to just see how the church went through I mean a deadly persecution that was called The Dark Age praise the Lord a deadly persecution until the uh uh uh uh uh room Rose to the place word I mean the uh the church was controlling the word it was controlling the government you know every King had to had they had the pope ahead of them but yet in such a Time the promise of a bride was State truth the promise of a Rapture was State truth the promise of adoption was State truth but yet God allowed his church to go through all of that if you were living in such a time you see that's the reason why Paul wrote that letter to the to the the church in Thessalonian about the rapture the reason why because the testimony church was on a social persecution and some started to believe that the Rapture has already taken place so Paul had to write them and reassure them that that time will not happen until there be a man of sin if you read history the Thessalonian church has always been a persecuted Church praise the Lord you see so things happen what I'm trying to say is that things happen in our lives we get down to our dark period or we get down to our Long Point that there is no way you can be able to associate the promise of God and the things that are going on in your life you look at those things you say sir how can I be a child of God praise the Lord amen the age has gone through it time has gone through it but God's word never fails praise the Lord he said he was going to have a church and yet he has a church that's the reason why when when uh uh uh the greatest move of God has raised on the scene the church system will always want to believe that it must come true then that's why they want to come to this place of a World Council of churches because uh I mean every one of us must believe the same we are serving the same God everybody on the same level praise the Lord amen and I believe that was the same thing that was happening to Young Mary all my friends are getting married at 18. she has plenty out that she was going to by 18 years I hope I have someone to take my hand in marriage praise the Lord here come Joseph we know he was he was a bit older than her history proved that he had a wife his wife passed away so he had children you know but God how all of these things planned out because he knew the path that he had laid down for Mary's life so he needed the right person to be there to be able to support her in that difficult time praise the Lord Mary believe brother Branham would talk and says how Mary went to the well he says in my being after uh uh uh uh a service are the synagogues and she listening to the priests reading this very scripture you know you know you know the message he said Joseph she and Joseph might have been reading Isaiah 9. about a virgin shall conceive and they are talking how could that be now so you see this whole thing about pondering over the word Mary started even before she she got an experience of what the shepherd was saying she was thinking how would this be how will a virgin be conceived praise the Lord amen now I don't want us to to dwell on Marion and leave ourselves out of out of out of mind I want I want us to think about ourselves because this is our day this is our time praise the Lord so brother Brandon would demonstrate how she kept that word on her mind she kept that that word on her mind a virgin shock and see how would that happen so what what was she doing she was taking the seed of God's word into the womb of her mind you see that's how God bring his promise God don't bring his promise when we are complaining and arguing when we are comparing with other people you know and just get all sorts of ugly thoughts on our mind no God bring his word to pass when we take the promise of God's word and keep it on our mind she kept that promise on how would this happen wow praise the Lord Brother man says that she and Joseph talk about it he said Joseph said I was very disappointed when the priest said you know things that God used to do he don't do it anymore he said I first saw this there was just something in me that did not agree with that because I believe he is the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord amen so if pondering over the word is if keeping the word keeping the promise of God on her mind could produce that word in her body it can do the same for you praise the Lord it can do the very same thing for you so the prophet of God says after almost an entire week she had this thing on her mind going and going and and there she went to the world and there she made that experience let's read something here uh we have seen his time brother Brahm says when you see something here in the scripture you say well now I believe that was just for the Apostle I believe Jesus did that in the days gone by amen praise the Lord like you are especially when it comes to decency it comes to you know uh uh uh faithfulness it comes to uh uh uh uh you know people are respecting their home respecting their family respecting their marriage vow they say oh that's Old Testament think amen people dressing decent is oh that's Old Testament think now you see whenever you do that you push the word away amen you push the seed of God because this Bible like Jesus said man shall not lay by bread alone but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God what is written in this Bible is every word that has come from out of God's mouth praise the Lord I believe that was just for the Apostle I believe Jesus did they are in the days gone by but the Bible said he is the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord just the same then if there are sins to be a question to you and you ponder over it he's saying if you read something in the scripture like I said before you read something in the scripture and it surprised you is always an opportunity it's always God's way of getting your attention praise the Lord because you're not reading you're not reading my my word even for you to say well let me see what brother one will say about it no no it's getting your attention if you if you just realize that this is God's word or I can help you to do is to just help the environment of your mind if you come in and ask me brother one I was reading this in the Bible that the Bible says uh uh you know uh and she kept all these things and Ponder on them well what I would tell you is my inspiration about it I believe that she was thinking on what the angel told her praise the Lord but God that have caught your attention amen so that's what brother Brown is saying here if you just ponder over it if you just stop right there that that's that's what the you know uh Wednesday service was such a blessing anyway brother brother Jordan brought the the message on Wednesday night if you just if you just stop right there they say oh Lord what are you trying to say to me amen well I don't understand this but I just believe there is something you know there there is that moment that moment where the word grabs your attention there is something there that just can't leave your mind praise the Lord amen you you might be listening to a tank and remember say something something with that a seed would drop in your mind the rest of everything that is being said even this morning you'll be sitting right here the preacher will say something there is just one thing would wrap your mind the other ones will just be going over you keep thinking on that you keep thinking on it wow what he said that what does that mean it's always an opportunity praise the Lord if you would just ponder over it like brother Barham says here if you were born away you can make it out and you see the things happen and you wondered about it then the angel of the Lord in some way in some way praise the Lord sometimes it's not in church praise the Lord sometimes you are just out and about doing your own thing but something happened and that word that you have Ponder on comes back to your mind praise the Lord the Bible says the angels of the Lord are in come about us amen they go with us when we are out there praise the Lord sometimes they use things out there and remind us it's just that we pull ourselves so much to the Natural realm then to the spiritual realm if we become sensitive to the spirit of God is sensitive to the voice of God praise the Lord you will know when the angel bumped your shoulder you ponder over it you can't make it out you don't have to reason it you don't have to make a story by yourself just keep it on your mind say Lord what is this Lord whatever it is be it unto me according to your word amen amen you can make it out you see things and and then you wanna he says then the angel of the Lord in some way way if you will be sincere praise the Lord because sometimes it's not just all about giving you great understanding sometimes it's addressing things in your life sometimes it's addressing things in your life if you will be sincere say yeah Lord that's true yeah I really need to deal with that I need to deal with that I need to I need to get over that Lord make me tired amen just make me tired with this thing it's true yeah I'm the one you're speaking to the Lord is true it's your word if you will be sincere amen he will reveal it to you and then it's no more a question is the truth it is those kind of experience that no man can preach you out of is those kind of an experience that no preacher can preach you out of praise the Lord because you witness God dealing with you he witnessed God dealing with you the preacher only come and confirm what God is saying but if this this matter if you and God no preacher can preach you out of faith praise the Lord amen now that's what I want to bring to your mind that word at the time that Jesus was born was as busy as our word today just like how their Christmas season is visit around the world commercial everywhere and and purchase every word and then and basically that word was busy because it was just about the time where Caesar sargassa asked people to go back here for taxation it was a busy time just like our world is busy but yet God yet Angels were appearing to people yet God was speaking to people I believe in the best world today God can still speak to you God can still deal with you praise the Lord it was a busy word they were traveling all over the place everybody had to go back to to their birth city for the sensor we in a busy world praise the Lord of out of Kovac everybody is trying to balance their their their account where we are burning out our money we spend our money you know we got a balance our account and all of these things are happening we want to get a better job we want to get a better education in order that all of these things we will keep dealing with fat until they put us six feet but what I want to bring to your mind in such a Time Angels was still appearing praise the Lord people were still experiencing Angelic visitation God was still dealing with some people and I believe it the same thing today that there are people that God is dealing with praise the Lord amen or when it came to the Shepherds it was it was there they were doing their normal Duty they go they went to work they were on the field and it was their working time they were not just there hanging out that was their job they were shepherds but yet God was dealing with them on their job Samia was in the temple God was dealing with him on his job Zacharias was in the temple waving incense the Bible say he was a righteous man and God met him at his pulse of Duty God met him at his job if we would just be sincere praise the Lord and don't make other people our problem realize that we are our own problems like I said Wednesday night I mean the bride is all about relationship it's all about relationship that's that's the thing salvation is about we have to realize relationship was broken in Eden When sin came it broke man from that intimate relationship with God so the coming of Christ a savior on the cross a blood sacrifice is to put us back into relationship now for us to stop at a religion or stop at a church is to have that relationship and that relationship with the father will affect every other relationship around us that's why John will say why would you why would you say that you love God that you can see and your brother that you see you don't love him how can you say you have relationship with the father and I believe that's what this message is all about it support us in an intimate in a closer relationship with God so much that it will affect our relationship with our children it will affect our relationship with our parents it will affect our relationship praise the Lord with the ones that are around us it does not mean that you will not have battle yeah you have people that will hate you amen but the Bible says if a man Waits pleases the Lord praise the Lord if a man Waits pleases the Lord even his enemy will be at peace with him are we together now so you have to realize that it was not married Choice Mary was not planning in her life that I'm going to be this girl that the the the I will be this girl I will you know I will keep myself and I will bring forth the Christ child no it was not that's the reason why the angel says Thou our favor it's a favor go a favor you God choose you he call you to this holy calling it's a favor that we have to be able to recognize the message of our day to recognize that there is a prophet that have came into this generation to recognize that the seal has been open Redemption is back in our hands we can go back to the place that Adam has fall from this is not just for knowledge or for understanding or just to be a slogan but it's a privilege it's it's Grace it's a favor that has come in our hands y'all are highly favored among women and I believe that this bride is highly favored praise the Lord you cannot take you cannot take my poor example of Christianity to say well if if I mean I I don't believe in no you cannot take any man's failure to make it a message truth no the message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord he's our champion no man is out no man is your champion no Pastor is your Champion Jesus Christ is your Champion he was the one says I gave my life freely and I take my life back again he was the one that paid the price on the cross of calvary praise the Lord so why why we're in man failure stop me from going on with God why should a man said I don't believe anymore he said because he don't believe I also don't believe praise the Lord oh we love man we love our parents we love our pastor but we have only one champion that's the Lord Jesus Christ he is our champion glory be to God Barbara said God is Simplicity he says what Mary taught although no matter what the outside taught she pondered all those things praise the Lord I believe from the very beginning Mary having her wedding on hand and now she's going to be expecting a child a sure she talks what would people think about me praise the Lord and I'm sure that talk went through her mind what would people think about me but you see our times goes by The Talk change who am I that gosh you favor me praise the Lord when she started saying that the wise men traveling two years to come and testify of the very same thing that she said an angel spoken to me when she saw the Angels she pondered but this time her pondering was different her pondering was different ah different pondering in our life we go through trials and there and how am I going through this praise the Lord just like Sarah the angel came there and talking to Abraham your wife Sarah will have a child she laughs the angel said why is Sarah laughing Abraham also she said no I did not laugh praise the Lord she lied about the first life but when the child was born she named him laughter she named him laughter because the Bible said she laughed I be the virus see my age that God will visit me oh God what is truth praise the Lord so her last laugh was different from the first life the first love was in disbelief the last life glory be to God amen so I believe that Mary had different section of pondering things would happen she would sit there and she pondered I believe even Jesus being on the cross she sat there she pondered because right when she took Jesus to be dedicated Simeon told her this child is for the rising and the falling of Israel praise the Lord and that man told her of things that she would go she said every time she she would listen to it she would she would pull her in her heart praise the Lord what kind of a child this would be that would be for the rising and the falling of Israel she's not talking she's just taking those words in your heart taking those words in Your Heart Lord give me Grace Lord help me give me Grace the Lord amen Lord help me give me Grace what do you think she taught when she when when Jesus says a little why you will see me no more what what what was she Ponder do you think that she was rejoicing my child is going to die for the word for all of those things all of those messages that we preach starts to come back to her mind all of those messages praise the Lord what Mary taught although no matter what the awesome word she pondered on all those things they hate it in their heart or she hid it in your heart they know they couldn't say nothing about it against it God speaks it to his men sometime saying hold your peace don't say nothing about it praise the Lord amen because it is only God that knows the intents of our heart the devil don't know the intent of your heart no but he has a way to know it you frustrate you and pretty soon you will say it out amen all he can do is just put a little bit of pressure on you and then pretty soon frustration you get you you allow frustration to get the best of you and then he will say it out you allow you to say it out but you see brother bam yet is is using also married experience how she she All Through the Ages you think about you think about David being anointed as a boy to be king when when uh when uh uh uh Samuel anointed him Samuel anointed him as a king but now going through everything that he went through in sawhouse Saw Troy and Javelin nahim he asked him King am I King is this the way you treat King praise the Lord and then when when he had to be a a a fugitive running on the hills and running all over the place he pondered over those things why is this happening to me why am I going through this Invincible Union Brother Band says that's the way that God beings for his people he bring us down to a place where we take an inventory of our life he said he allowed tension to come on us he said tension is good for the Believers because it makes us to take an inventory and make us to re-examine our walk with God praise the Lord and he says when you have looked through your life and you have looked around and and and there is not a reason you can't find a sin that you have done you can find what is happening then you know that God is just setting you out for the blessing praise the Lord because the religious word in every religion every religion has learned to believe that evil is because of something you have done when things are happening wrong to you you got to go and appease the Gods hmm and it's not like that all the time praise the lord it's true sin is is the reason of all of our problems but sometimes when you are going through things it's not because you there's a there's a there's a sin you have done or there's a sin back in your family no sometimes God is just setting you apart he's just setting you apart praise the Lord amen oh that's that's a scary place to get for you to be set apart among everybody that's the scary place to get amen all human life we like it you know why you just call the person named stand up and start giving them all the praise or we like it amen we try to act humble we don't want to smile buff ET what is happening is just like you taking an air and pumping the flesh you're putting air in the flashlight praise the Lord but when God does his the one that we're supposed to rejoice in a smile at when he pulled us aside praise the Lord glory be to God you have found favor with God you have found favor with God Amen that God can deal with you at the age that you are you have to you have to remember amen he's the ancient of day praise the Lord age does not matter to him what matter to God is his purpose praise the lord it's his purpose That's What mattered to God not age now Suburban says he said that's how he deals with his men he allowed them to ponder over those things they had them in his in in their heart they know they can't say nothing about it they just watch to see God moving on the scene seeing wow this thing will happen praise the Lord and sometimes they die with those things that he kept in their heart praise the Lord amen sometimes they die with those things that they kept in their heart question and answer he says and I pray that each one of these will take these things in their heart and may they ponder over it and think like this yes there is there is the church there is these things that's what the Bible says Birmingham talks even about the man on the on the road of image Clippers and his friends he says and as his friends Clippers and his friend was on the road of imayers very much discouraged but they were pondering on the scriptures and that was the thing that Drew Jesus on the scene they were pondering on the scriptures praise the Lord amen what a privilege we have uh you know as as uh as Believers of the message of the hour let me see it that way amen what a privilege that God would take us through the scriptures and teach us like this you know teach us like this that even the negative things that is happening in our around our life are enough to give us muscles praise the Lord enough to be able to encourage us to keep pressing or keep saving the law because that's God's law of dealing with the Earth he takes the Earth through a dry period of time a bar on the earth and yet he brought forth a guardian of Eden out of it like I said God is more concerned about his purpose he's concerned about his purpose concerning your life there's a purpose there's a word that is hanging over you just like Thy Word of a virgin conceived was hanging over Mary and when the angel said it unto her thank God she had the grace to say be it unto me according to your word thank God she had the grace to say be it unto me I call into your word do you know what what it would have been for Mary to her just start yelling the other way embarrassing the Angels yeah see that somebody talking to me yet about time I'm going to get conceitful what is that bad dreams praise the Lord but you see God always prepare us because God will never be embarrassed on his word when he's about to bring his word to pass he will never be embarrassed even if it's an embarrassed situation he's the one that make the fabric of our body he knows how to hold you down praise the Lord he knows how to make you to think right when even the situation don't look right he knows how to condition our mind and condition our heart because God will never be in on his word praise the Lord musicians you can come when we receive the word him only will first take the word into our mind will receive the word in our mind brother Brown says the right Mentor approach to every word of God the word that you have received on your mind as you think about it do you fuss with faith do you argue or do you give that word back to the Lord and say Lord your word have been spoken I'm just acclaim
