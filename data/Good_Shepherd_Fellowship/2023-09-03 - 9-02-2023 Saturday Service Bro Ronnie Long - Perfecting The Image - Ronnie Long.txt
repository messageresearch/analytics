this amen amen now we wanted to bring our family but it just didn't work out this time so maybe if there's another time Lord willing will bring them but we send greetings from them and we got five little ones and the wife back home and so they're here with us in spirit and of course to bring greetings from our pastor brother Lawson and the church back home instead of Gucci with the one and said their greetings whether Andrew said to greet you in the church brother Andrew Glover so we know just uh we're just Kindred Fellowship we got to meet Brother Juan uh there in Alaska a few months ago and I walked in the middle of service I've got Flo flew in and I just walked in he was already preaching I said man I don't know what this guy's preaching but I like this man we just found a good fellowship and a good Harmony and it wasn't just a few minutes of sitting in there and he was already preaching my notes I had for the next service so we were we were in one Accord amen praise the Lord I know it's hot but we're here to praise Him Anyway amen amen so just we just get comfortable together and try not to take too much time I got a timer here so thank you for the musics and the songs but if you have your scripture open our Bibles thank you brother appreciate you amen I told the guy in the back I said is this is this on is this working I don't usually use one of these so my hands are liable to do anything so I just want to open with this quote familiar to us Brandon would say we're not come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message and the message is Christ he is the word that's right we're to get into it beneath it yes sir that is what we're supposed to do so that's what a what a word Prophet said a word church would do is to get in the message to get underneath it so just so we're all in one Accord that's where I'm coming from tonight is we want to be in the message of the hour which I believe is Christ if you have your scripture Return of the Book of Genesis return to the first chapter maybe while you have that word open tonight we just approach the father and if there's a need on your heart in in opposition of all the circumstance I believe God can still meet that need no matter how you feel or what it looks like or nothing I could bring or say can meet that need but God Alone could meet that need as we look at this scripture let's just raise our hands before Him Father we love you Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord how you brought us this far Lord by Just Your unmerited Grace Lord and father one more time as we just set aside this day in this moment Lord to come in and not just see one another and Lord not just to fill a seat but Lord I hear from you Almighty father Lord I ask that you just opened your scripture to US One More Time Lord father Without You anointing it is just words on a paper but Lord will you be the life in it tonight father Lord I pray you speak to the needs father Lord I Surrender my own thoughts father my own ideas Lord the directions father I Surrender it all to you Lord I pray that you would just take the Lord this vessel tonight this voice and use it for your glory father Lord I give you all my strength in my in my might father Lord I pray that you bless your people in this building tonight father bless those that are sick at home that would like to be here father couldn't be here I pray that the Holy Spirit would visit them where they're at father but Lord for us in this assembly in these four walls tonight father I pray we look Beyond just what we see or feel Lord but we see a Heavenly Kingdom coming down father Lord that's our desire I pray there's there would be healings father you touch every sick and Afflicted in our midst father I pray there'd be Deliverance father deliver the oppressed and The Afflicted oh god father I pray there be filling of your Holy Spirit tonight oh God those that have need father a refilling of fresh out pouring father I have need of you father and Lord I pray you come our way Lord use your word father to open our hearts we pray in Jesus name amen amen the scripture says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters the 26th verse was saying God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good amen may God bless his word tonight you may be seated and God looked at everything he had created in the time and effort he'd spent in the and all of all of his his work was completed and God looked upon that and he said it's very good I think that's words we can we can take to heart tonight no matter how we feel or what we what we think about ourselves God looked upon his creation and he said it's very good and so tonight I just want to take this this this for a thought that maybe we will just if we can we'll I don't know if we'll finish it tonight or not we got another service tomorrow I think if you don't run me off but the image will speak for itself the image will speak for itself so God created man in his own image and after his likeness and he created man in all his ways in the spirit of a Man was created after the image of God right so that's what we read there in that scripture and I know you're a well-taught group but forgive me if I over uh over teach or over say something you already know but just we'll just be in one Accord all right so God created uh the image of what he wanted to portray God created uh he didn't just he didn't just happen happen you just happen to be the way you are but God so created you in his mind that he made you exactly how he saw you this was before time began right now the scripture we're reading is Before Time began and so God created you in that image and God looked at you and he said you're very good so this weekend if we don't get anything else I want to encourage us that you're right where God wants you to be just trust in the word you've been placed in because he's already said it is very good so to think about this Creator and and the way the way that we think about all of the all of the stars in their place and the planets in their orbit and everything is so specifically designed by it but there must be some intelligence behind it I I think Roland won a court of that it didn't just happen this way but there's a power that placed all of this together if the Earth was just a few degrees away or a few degrees further then it would be too hot or it would be too cold but this must be by some design that we're here right spinning in this space that we're in right amen are we in agreement what we're right here spinning in perfect order with God's creation and the thing that God had thought of all this in his mind and I don't know how it all came about and so size tells us it maybe took 300 million years for all of this to come about and that's that's fine with me I don't dispute that I don't know how long it took God but I know God created the heavens and the Earth and as as this as this uh Cosmos is coming forth and as the planets are coming into existence and and he's placing the Earth right where it needs to be in orbit with the sun and the gravitational pull that it would have and all this just coming together in the mind and the Creator right and he sees this image and he's speaking these things into existence right because we know that the first thing we just read there in Genesis the first thing to come was not like but the first thing to come was the voice of God right and God said so the spoken word is the original right it's the first thing that there ever was when when God tells Moses to write about this in Genesis he's riding right from the lips of the Creator himself and he said write it like this Moses and in the beginning God said amen so in the beginning before there was a light or a sun there was there was a spoken word that's right and that was the first thing to come forth and then by that all of this was created right and I I just want to take a step back and to look at the creation that we're on and to think of how marvelous it is and maybe some of us uh you know come from different parts of the world or have been able to travel all over the world or maybe we've just stayed right here in Minnesota but wherever you go you see the beauty of God's work right you see the that it didn't just happen this way but there's there's an artist behind this there there's there's such a there's such an eye for for beauty behind this that he would make all this and we go to Africa or we go to the rain forest or we go to Alaska or we go and all over we go everywhere I travel I just see the hand of God and I see it amongst his people more than anything and you meet a bit of the Bride over here and you meet a bit of the Bride over here and a brother here and a sister there and you see the work of the hand of God right and you see all this coming together and this didn't just happen but somebody thought of this in their mind yes like an artist that was that was portraying his thoughts and so maybe it took 300 million years for all this to come together and to be in existence into for all the science tells us that it took hundreds of millions of years for there to be enough calcium and enough iron and enough salt in the Earth for us to exist right for our bodies made up of these elements and they tell us it took all this time for this to degrade in the layers of the earth and the layers of the of the different phases of the Earth's core and all this took time together now I'm not teaching a geography lesson but I want us to see the the power of God and so he takes all this time to put it together and to think I I heard brother Ed biscoll say this one time and it really stuck with me if God spent 50 million years making the Earth that we would dwell on for just 70 years how much time did he spend making the focus of his creation how much time did he actually spend on the ones that were the apple of his eyes so if you spend all this time creating this earth and the trees and the ozones and the layers of the earth how much time did he spend on you now you might not think that there's something important or something worth value but God thought you were value God thought you were the apple of his eye so God in his mind had thoughts right now we look at God in this in this in this in this portion here as as the artist and if you go to an art gallery or if is there any artists in here tonight maybe somebody that draws or paints or and and so when you look at somebody's artwork now I can't draw I can't paint but when you look at somebody's our artwork you're seeing their thought right right you're seeing their mind you're seeing their thought expressed you're seeing what they have on the inside of them I could tell you what I'm thinking but the best way for me to to tell you what's really in my vision is to draw it for you is to explain it to you is to break it down and to show it in an image something tangible and then you can see what I'm talking about right now I can I can explain to you uh you know a lot of different things I can explain to you how I've been in in Brazil at the start of the at the start of the Amazon river right and I could explain to you how there's these two rivers that come together and there's a gray one and there's a black one and they come together and there's a solid line and that's the start of the Amazon I've seen that but for me to describe it to you it doesn't do it justice right but if you be standing Where I Stood then you could see what I'm saying right the only way for you to really understand what I'm bringing is to have stood Where I Stood right so you can see the same thing that I'm portraying to you so we didn't just end up here by chance but God is trying to portray his mind he's trying to display his thoughts and that's where we come from and that excites me church because I'm not just here by circumstance I'm not just here because my mama and daddy or my grandma and grandpa but God Almighty has seen me in his eye in the back part of his mind and he said there will come this thought forward and it will look exactly the way that I've designed it I've thought of it in my mind it will be the display of my heart now if an artist pours himself into something he's pouring his whole heart into it right he's he's giving everything he is into that because he wants you to get what's really on the inside of him he wants you to get that painting in a way if you could just see this little this little Brook and this little cottage in these and you see the artist is trying to portray this to us and and he's he's taking the extra measures and the mixing the pain and the colors and all that color is not just writer this color is not just right or we can take it to music how many musicians we have in here and so in the heart of a musician he's got a met a melody in him yeah right he's got a tune in him and he's got to work on this until that tune comes out now a musician will play on the piano and he'll play on the guitar you know and he'll dig ding ding ding but it doesn't sound just right and so he'll stay there until it gets just right right he's not going to just settle for that's good enough but he's going to practice that until it sounds just the way he hears it in his mind now there's another there's another chord there there's something I can't quite find and I'm gonna stay there and I'm gonna labor in this until I can get the exact chord that I'm looking for right until I can see the exact fulfillment of what my thought is now to think of a musician or an artist or or somebody like that would labor in that how much more the Creator the great artist would labor in us not just settling for good enough is good enough but he's going to labor in us until he sees the perfect work fulfilled everything that's in his mind and his thought his creative power he's not going to settle for just good enough and that's why we go through the fiery Trials of this life because God won't settle for just good enough God will have a perfect church God will have a perfect bride there will be one without spot or wrinkle no matter what the chaos the world looks like God has already said there will come a perfect work and when he looked at this and he took a step back he said it is very good I like what I see I like what happened here I like that that people have took me at my word and they're the exact image of what I've seen in my mind we can turn to the Book of John here to pick this up and John 1 we know says in the beginning was the word yeah yeah and the Word was with God and the Word was God brother Brandon would take this to the 14th verse and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and full of Truth so in the beginning was the spoken word and that word was God amen that word was with God but then that word was cast into flesh right that word was spoken into flesh now the quote we read at the beginning of this what is the message of the hour it's Christ okay so if we could read this scripture like this and the message was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so Christ has been made Flash and dwells Among Us now I I don't believe that that just stopped somewhere back in the 60s I believe the message is still alive and it's made flesh and it's dwelling Among Us right and it was was in the beginning so it must also be the same at the end right the alpha has become the Omega so we're just in the middle of this waiting for this to finalize so we see where we have a part to play in this the word became flesh and it dwelt among them so God has a witness in this age now we look back at the perfect creation of Jesus Christ right the great artist God would would speak which would would have a thought and he would say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell and that body would come and it would come by a supernatural birth and it would and we know we know the Bible and we know the history of this but but just watch how God the great artist portrays this and he paints this and so Jesus comes and he's the perfect the perfect the perfect work of God he's a hundred percent man but he's 100 God he's the perfect work of God the perfect balance and there he is walking amongst other people that don't even know who he is and there's other churches that don't know who he is and the preachers don't know who he is and the religions don't know who he is but there he is the perfect image of the mind of God walking amongst them and they're studying of how to find him but yet he's walking amongst them and they don't recognize who he is but yet he's the perfect work of God so this artist has been describing what will come right through the mouth of Isaiah he would say behold the Virgin shall conceive and he's describing what this piece of art will look like when it comes but if I try to tell you what's in my mind and I can't portray it to you you're going to be left your own imagination of what it'll look like right and you might have a cow up in the tree somewhere and the grass on the moon and everything might be backwards because we're relying on our own information or our own imagination but when we see it come in view then there's nothing left to the imagination we have the real piece of what God was trying to describe and though he took the time to explain and explain and through the prophets and through the the book books that these men studied they were looking for the manifestation of the Masterpiece of God but when the Masterpiece came in front of them they didn't recognize it they didn't know who he was they they got off on their own man's imagination and they put their own spin on what it would look like when God came and even then the the art piece would speak to them he would say if you you say you have Abraham to your father but if you knew Abraham you would know me because he spoke of what I would be when I come now he's identifying himself to be the same one that spoke to Abraham the same one that spoke to Abraham and I find that in our age there's there's a there's an identified Masterpiece amongst this world and they don't recognize it they don't see it but I believe as a Church of the Living God we see the Masterpiece on display we we see God coming down and fulfilling his exact his exact mind in the hearts of the people and through the message of the hour right I find it that we're in this age where there's a there's a conflict in the land was was did this really happen was this really the case did this really is this is this is this and you see I I look back in the scripture to find where we come from now I grew up I grew up in the message I was I was born into a message home but that doesn't make me have give me any more rights than anybody else in fact you gotta you gotta actually go through a birth process sitting on the Pew and it's not that night and day transfer maybe one day you were in drugs and you were in sin and you were an alcohol and you were but you've got to change from that vile creature that you are into a blood box son or daughter of God you can't just remain and say well I was born into this the birthright is not just given but it's adoption right it's something that you move into so you can't just say well I was born into this and thank God you were but you've got to have a change within you the same change that the drunk has or The Prostitute has we've got to have the same change or we're just a Sepulcher on the Pew right we're just a closed tomb sitting in the chair we've got to have the Life of Christ at the the center needs and and the one born in church needs the same right so I had to come through the same experience that we all have had to come through through the blood of Christ through the path of repentance through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and find that I'm a Son of God right so we're not gonna We're Not Gonna Change the program of God for our individual thing but if God ever spoke it then that's the way it's always going to be it doesn't matter if our Daddy's a pastor doesn't matter if our grandpa is a pastor it doesn't matter if our if our if our Grandpa's the prophet himself we've got to come through the same birth that God commanded everybody would come through and he said absolutely absolutely you will not even recognize the Masterpiece of God until first ye be born again we've got to start there we can't we can't wait make it way down the road and then forget that we had a birth we've got to have a birth right so we know that tonight we we we we feel the urgency in this hour to get everything right right we can look around at the at the world and the chaos and see that everything's in disorder and everything is in disarray and there's confusion on in the news and this and that but beside all that there's a chosen word that's going to come forth there's a chosen people that will come out of this chaos and they will take God at his word and I say why not us I I say we've been given everything that we have need of to come out of this chaotic world that we're in and only Heap to the word of God and nothing else not my opinion not his opinion not your opinion not her opinion but only to the word of God not what some Bishop says or some hierarchy says but only what the word of God has already said it is the perfect plan right so we're moving through this this this thing called time looking for the final the final turn right yeah but but we're still expressing the mind of the artist through all of this and brother Brandon would take this and he would say there's inspiration that comes upon an artist and he would spend some time dealing with the subject of Michelangelo and Moses right he would say Michelangelo would take this statue of Moses and and he would he would begin to work on it he would labor I think something like 15 years 20 years or something like that on this statue and and and he would he would he would carve and he would carve and he would labor in this but he was he was trying to release an image in his mind Michelangelo I believe had the inspiration of God in this as the artist he would not stop until it was the exact image that was within his mind that's right and God's not going to stop on us until we express the exact image that's what's in his mind right where are the artwork of God and he's the great artist and he's not going to let up on us until we magnify everything that he saw in his mind all right so I said the brother some pictures I'm not really a PowerPoint guy but I sent the brother some pictures and uh uh maybe give that first one brother Maybe maybe they didn't come through are we okay am I going too fast am I going too slow Okay so this is a block it's pretty exciting right there's really nothing pretty about that right really nothing magnificent to us workers I work construction that just looks like a lot of work I've got to move that somewhere and it's gonna be really hard to do my back hurts just looking at it because I I don't have the mind of an artist I just look at that and I think well I've got to get that somewhere I got a transporter from A to B and it's going to be hard work but if you put that block in the hands of the right man there's something that he sees within there right there's something that lays within there there there's a value in there amen amen that that I can't see because I don't have the mind of an artist but if you put that block in the in the hands of an artist he's going to see something in there he's going to see something that's Way Beyond just this block or this face or just work or moving in from A to B but this to the artist is the most prized possession that he has and he's just got to go to work on this thing and he's going to labor on this and he's going to spend time on this and you think and if you saw an artist just take this block and take it to his home and he's so excited he said man I've got this block and I'm just really happy about this we're gonna have a good time and you think my this guy is crazy yeah he's lost his mind what is he gonna do with this block but as he begins to as he begins to put his hands to it as it begins to reveal what's on the inside of him yeah it becomes something beautiful right it becomes something Mighty and Majestic and he's revealing what's on the inside of him by the work of his hands right so if you have the next picture there this is the same block but in another phase oh now that looks pretty nice I don't know about you but I couldn't recreate that with a chisel and a hammer to think this was done around the I think it was the year 1500 or so and just a hammer and a chisel going to work now that came from that block did you see that in that block no you didn't see that in that black but there was a value in that block right whether we saw it or whether we didn't it's the same block but if you put it in the right hands it becomes a masterpiece right now this is Michelangelo's Moses of what brother Brandon would be preaching about how he took the time and see how detailed it is and see how how much how much was given to every precise detail of this he didn't leave out one thing but he didn't he didn't just settle for good enough but you can see the the framing in the cheekbones and the way the beard is and the arms and the positioning and the authority and the direction he's looking and everything has a purpose because it's how he pictured it in his mind yeah yeah and he's not going to just settle for good enough but he's got to have what was already in his mind yeah he's got to work on it and work on it but if you take that block and you put it in the hands of a master it becomes this now if that block gets sidetracked and ends up in the wrong hands they will never turn out looking like the creation it was supposed to be but it's got to be in the hands of the one who saw it to begin with right it's got to be in the hands of the one who said I know the value that's within that rock and I can make it show yeah and the famous quote that Michelangelo would say is I just needed to release Moses Moses was trapped on the inside of the rock I just needed to release him now the world might not see any value to you or you or you but God has has seen a value within you he has seen the authority within you he has seen the power within you he has seen the faith within you and he has gone to work on his Masterpiece and he's touched it with his hands and he's delivered and he's healed and he's shown and he's revealed and he's polished and he's cut away with his chisel and his hammer now I wonder if Moses could speak if he would say ow do you think Moses think about that block of granite we just saw and then look at this how much was carved away how much Rock was carved away from this from this masterpiece I I think if he could speak he would say ow he would say that was a lot of me that was taken away that was he would have been fine just in his original blackness but the the the the artist saw what he could be and he said if you'll just lay within my presence for just enough time I can make you the way I see you in my mind if you'll just lay within the anointing long enough he'll make you the way he sees you you don't have to work to it but he the great artist will go to work on you and he'll make sure that there's no impurities there's nothing out of out of out of cater but everything will be perfectly ordained the way he saw you in his mind before there ever was before there ever was a trial before there ever was a sickness or a circumstance or a defeat or an attitude or upset or afraid or a fear or anxious or depressed before any of that he'll ensure that you get back to the original creation of what he saw you in his mind but we've got to be willing to lay within the presence of the master we've got to be willing to lay within the anointing of the hour to let it do the work on us and to take away everything that's not of him so that we can become the fullness of the Masterpiece of God now this this is such an attention to detail here now think about this this is Michelangelo just a man that we we assume he was a Christian by drawing Moses or by making Moses here but we don't know if he knew the Lord we don't know anything about him and if he had that attribute to pay that much attention to detail how about the one that he got it from and you think that you're just here by chance I'm preaching to you now you think you're just here by circumstance or your parents or your grandparents or you just walked in because you had nowhere else to go but to think that if Michelangelo uh uh a sin born man can have that kind of attention to detail how much more does God have attention to detail in your life every in every in fear every inability every every conquering moment God has paid attention to every detail and he will not settle for less than perfection our Prophet did not come in this age to say that gods are going to have an imperfect bride but the prophet came in this age to declare to us that God already he has a Perfect Bride and it will come through this word and she will be the Fulfillment of the mind of God and she will look exactly like the way he saw her in his mind before there ever was before there ever was a creation he saw you he saw you now think about this now you can give me that next slide you might not know this but I thought this was interesting to think that God so this here is this tendon on this arm right and that tendon there is flexed and this muscle's flexed that tendon's raised up because this Pinky is moved he had enough attention to detail that because Moses was holding the tablet and his pinky was moved this tendon flexed in his arm now did Moses the statue have to tell that tendon to do that did Michelangelo have to tell his tendon to flex when he moved his pinky no he saw the position of the rest of the body and he knew that this part of the body would be in that position Mission because the attention to detail was there to say if this is doing this then this will do this now when you take a step you don't have to command your toes to spread out for balance but they do it automatically right because they're part of the body and they know how to move in the body they know that this moves with this and you walk in perfect balance and everything's in cater and in order because it's part of one body right so why would God have anything less than perfection in his body when one part moves like this the other part moves like this and when one part's in this position this part's in this position now we don't have to command that to happen but it's the body there's already an intelligence of the Holy Ghost within the body that tells it what position to be in at what time and where and how and what to do about it you see we're walking in the word so the word tells us what position we need to be in now all of us don't hold a microphone all of us don't sing a song all of us don't play the guitar but all of us are in the body right all of us are in a perfect position or should be moving when the body moves when the head moves the rest of the body moves when the head looks this way the rest of the body turns why because it's the command center the holy ghost in the church is the command center and we don't have to force it we don't have to work it up we're not working up into an emotion but we know how to move when the head is moving we know how to how to operate under the unction of the Holy Ghost in our body right because we're in the body of Christ are we not amen so if we're in the body then we're moving in one Accord with the rest of the body if you're trying to walk this way but you're you're this arm wants to stay back here it's not really going to work right but everything has to move in in perfect unison in the body right when one hurts we all hurt when one's Victorious we're all Victorious we're moving in Harmony in the body but the attention to detail he sees it now this is just a this is just a man you think that if he could see that going on 2000 years ago he could create this and see that attention to detail and think about how much it took to get that detail to come out look at the vein work look at the pinky and the in the skin detail and you see and that just is a man's eye but how much greater is the eye of God right Psalms 139 would say for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made in the Greek that word fearfully means beautifully beautifully and wonderfully made marvelous sorry that works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously rod in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book were all my members written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them this is to say in the Amplified we can break this down and in your book we're all written the days that were appointed for me when as yet there was not one of them even taking shape so this is the mind of an artist this is the mind of a creator and he's seeing his creation before there ever is elements to make it happen before there ever is the molecules and the atoms for it to come together he's seeing it David is saying in in form he's seeing the image of it and he's working towards that image this is out of the can we read this out of the church age book watch carefully now and see this before there ever was a speck of Stardust before God was God for God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God and he was known only as an eternal spirit the bride was already somebody say already already in his mind you want to know where you come from somebody say already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not yeah the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal yes this is powerful if you can see this you see this the thoughts of God are Eternal if you can see this you will see many things because this is a foundation Revelation if you can see that the thoughts of God are Eternal you will see many other Revelations come together as what the prophets telling us you will see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore he he as God must be omniscient and if he is omniscient he is he is not now learning nor is he taking counseling within himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he could add to his knowledge then he's not amnition he is omniscient he has never had a new thought I want to sink in Prince he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God now this is powerful thus the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he is drawn up in which one they will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God so I just want you to Pat yourself on the chest you're real you're real are you really here are you really here you're really here because you are an eternal thought of God his thoughts are Eternal and they are real they never had a beginning nor will nor will not have a defeated testimony at the end but they will be victorious in every trial and in every circumstance through the blood that gives them strength right Revelations 12 would tell us how we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony now a lot of us bear a bad testimony if you ask us well I'm really sick today pastor I'm just defeated and now how is that an overcoming testimony right the blood of the Lamb is there that's right it did its work yeah there's power power Wonder working Power in the Blood okay so that's there right we believe in the power of the blood now we have a part to play in this what is the word of Our Testimony what is what we're def we're we're defying the devil with every moment that we have a breath we are victorious we are more than conquerors we are Overcomers we are not of this world but we are of another world we are not defeated but we are walking out on the ashes of the wicked because that is our testimony that is what the scripture says about us I don't believe brother one that God caused the man to keep his life free from the things of the world keep his life above reproach uh knock away supernaturally cigarettes and alcohol take his take not let him take his own life when he tried several times I don't believe it was just about the man but I believe a message had to come forward and if he did all that to bring a message out why would that message come and God goes through all that to tell you that you weren't going to make it [Music] why would God go through all that to tell you that that you just don't have enough faith and you might as well give up why would God go through all the trouble of all of all of this all of this this this belief that we're in and living a life above reproach and why do we have to act this way and why do we have to live above the world and why do we have to live above sin and and just so we can come in here that we're not going to make it I don't hear that when I listen to the message I don't hear that I'm just not gonna make it when I listen to the message but when I listen to the message I believe that there's two folds to this Brother Juan I believe he's Elijah in every way I believe the message brought forth the voice of Elijah casting judgment and casting what will come but he's also cerebral message to the world which is to walk under that Covenant of Grace hearing that only that I am walking in the perfect will of God and it's Grace Grace Grace over my life it's the message of zeroable to the church that we are going to make it you are going to make it despite your own inability despite your own weakness God will perfect his strength through our weakness that's what he said the message to do I don't read this Bible and think that I'm going to end up in a lake of fire I do not identify myself with that I identify on those that will walk out on the ashes identify myself on those that will be caught up in Heavenly places I identify myself on those that will tarry until they're endued with power for on high I identify myself with those scriptures they are more than conquerors their Victory through Jesus Christ faith is our victory what are we identifying Our Testimony with you what's the word of it is it defeated is it barely here is it barely going to make it or are we walking on every promise and every word strong in every promise now we could take this to we could take this back up to Romans 4 for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness he staggered not somebody say not nah he's staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong somebody say strong strong in faith giving glory to God that's a powerful testimony to have to think about when Paul who spares no expense being nice Paul would have wrote whatever he wanted to write but Paul wrote that under inspiration he staggered not but was strong in faith unto every promise now is that going to be the word of your testimony when you're done here has given to the church now we go back and we read the book of Genesis and we find out that that is not Abraham's life yeah Abraham was just a regular old guy working a regular old job worshiping regular old idols hanging out with his regular old family but there was something inside Abraham that his brother didn't have that his daddy didn't have that his sister didn't have that his mama didn't have there was something inside of Abraham that God knew was there because it was a creation in his mind and he said there'll be a time when I'll have an Abraham and I'll place a seed within there and at the appointed time I will resurrect the seed with inside him and he will come to me and I'll do it by calling him by name Brad is that what the scripture says but then we look at Abraham's life and we say well he started out as an unbeliever he wasn't born in a good message home he didn't wasn't born to good parents they were Idol worshipers they were probably cheaters and Steelers and drunkards and everything else but there was a seed in him yes now we look at Abraham Abram when he's when he's hauled out of Babylon and he's walking out you think he was Victorious and everything after that Abraham didn't even know where he was going Abraham had no idea he just knew he'd been called out and he was walking by faith and not knowing and he let his nephew pick what direction he would go right because he didn't know where to go he said you choose so lot chooses and Abraham goes this way yeah but it was all according to the plan of God because God's seeds are ordered he knows exactly where they're at and you might have thought that you chose or you turn left because you wanted to but God Almighty knew what direction you would turn and how to get you underneath this word when you needed to be underneath it you're his art piece you're his Masterpiece and he knows just how to get you where he wants you to get you into position and then we look further into the life of Abraham we see that he laughed at the promise of God before Sarah did he laughed if the mess of God now we quote that as Sarah laughed at the promise of God but Abraham left first right he doubted right there but yet when his testimony is written is there a contradiction there no no sir but when his testimony is written about his life Paul says he staggered not but was strong in faith so we see here from Paul that it's not how you start or what's in the middle but it's how you finish fish it's not how you started out in this life it's not the cards you were dealt or I'm just like this or I just have this issue but it's how you finish this you'll be called by name to a higher plane than your birth name or your birth mom or your birth Daddy but you were called to be a finisher of the work of God and in the days of the voice of the seven Angel the mysteries of God what are we we're the express mystery of God and in the days we listen to the voice of the word we will finish it we're finishers friends there's not another generation coming there's not another church coming there's not another Prophet coming there's not another age coming we are called out of this age to be a finisher that is our commission this hour not just to come fill a seat and say well my mom did this for 50 years and I just want to be in her shoes no we're called to be a finisher we're called to go beyond what any church has ever done but to think that we're the express Masterpiece of God such attention to detail you think he sent you here without the right equipment filter you think he just cast you out into the worst age that there ever was and say I hope you make it not my God not the god that has paid such attention to detail in my life and the times you didn't think he was there he was there and the time you thought you were all alone and nobody heard you and you said I wonder if anybody's even hearing this prayer God was there and you wonder how you ended up where you're at tonight sitting in this seat it was God Alone in his Mercy that brought you here we would have been dead we would have been drunk we would have been in a in a in in some slum house somewhere we would have been destitute bankrupt in a cardboard box but God in his Mercy has brought us into the fullness of the word which is the richest place we could ever be in this revelation there's nothing outside this there's there's nothing out there to Crave or to desire but this is the only satisfaction in life and I don't believe that we come to this rock and we we come here to in a weary land to find a dry Rock but we come in a weary land of fine water this word does not tell me that I'm not gonna make it I don't know what you read but this word does not tell me that's right that I'm just gonna get right to the finish line and not have enough faith I don't identify myself with foolish virgin this word does not tell me that I'm just going to get to the finish line and I'm going to run out of the holy ghost power and I'm gonna have to go search the Pentecostal church for it that my cup will be overflowing With the blessings of God through the word that makes it perfect that's what it tells me what does it tell you that's right I believe it tells us that we're Overcomers I believe it says that they somebody say they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony now what word is on there what's the word on your board Brother Band would talk about driving down the road and he would be driving past billboard after billboard and he would be ignoring them and all of a sudden one would say hungry hungry and it would catch his attention why because he was hungry and the Simplicity of that one word message over that board caught his attention and he he looked at that board he said I am hungry and it just said on the bottom and said three miles ahead and he ended up eating at that restaurant because that sign caught his attention that's right so there's that there's a there's a signpost there's a sign that is to catch our attention it may not be a lot of this or a lot of that but it might just be a one-word message but it catches is our attention and by that we come to the Fountain we come to get more we want what the what the picture says we're hungry blessed is he who hunger and thirsteth after righteousness for he shall be filled so he shows up to the table and he says I'm hungry feed me now what if that message would have said hungry turn around two miles well he would have found himself searching yeah yeah but that wasn't the original message we're Minneapolis right so in Minneapolis I'm sure if you drive around here not very far you'll pass some Billboards right and somebody thought of that billboard some uh advertising marketer Guru thought of this billboard that it would be just this great thing to attract people to their Holiday gas station and it has this image on there and these words and that was the original message in his mind but you leave that sign up there for a couple days and in the middle of the night ah you people don't have that here but we have it out in Ohio and these these these people will sneak in the middle of the night and they'll graffiti ride over the top of somebody's brand new billboard and they just put all this money and all this effort into all this to to track somebody to what they're trying to sell and somebody comes in there and writes a word you can't even read over the top of the billboard and then another one another one and another one and it comes and there's all this stuff written over the billboard but there's an original message that's right right underneath all that graffiti that was there before the graffiti got there you might think that depressed or defeated is the word of your testimony or maybe cancer or maybe diabetes or maybe just anxiety or maybe fear maybe maybe fearful is just the word in your testimony but if you would if you would just take off the graffiti there's an original message underneath that that somebody we when we were in the streets we used to call it bombing right and you go out and you bomb the sign underneath where somebody has bombed that sign there's an original message down there and if you could just wash away the graffiti in your life you would see that there's already a word over your life and it says overcome the word of Our Testimony defeated is imony most gonna make it is not my testimony weak and faith is not my testimony but graffiti has covered my life with I'm just not gonna be this or I'm just not gonna be that but if we could just take the blood of the lamb and wash our board clean wash your sleep clean and see what the original one is down on the inside there's an original you there's an original message there's an original thought of God down there but it's been covered up with man and his idea right right there's an original message Untouched by this man's thought or that man's thought or so and so or this or that or this there's still an original message we can't look and say ah there's just too much fanaticism or ah there's too much of this we're letting the original message just go to waste what we ought to do is fulfill the commission of restoration of the prophet and get back to the original message that he preached now it's not enough you know this Brother Juan it's not enough just to quote what the prophet quoted I can say a quote to you and make you think that you'll never make it I could actually read brother branham's words and make you think that the days of Miracles are passed he would say oh bless God they're doing some Miracles are passed now if I don't read that in the spirit that he preached it and I decide I'm gonna say well the Church see the difference the same words but the spirit of it's wrong the spirit behind it is twisting it to its own Advantage so you've got to recognize the spirit that the prophet brought it in it's not just enough to quote him or to read it but you've got to catch the spirit of the message you've got to catch the vision that if this is really easy to discern I hope it's okay everyone but this is really easy to discern Church everybody with the Holy Ghost has discernment that's right okay now I know that some have a gift of knowledge and a gift of wisdom and a different gifted discernment that's okay but everybody with the Holy Ghost has discernment for the word right so it's really easy for us young or old new or or fresh or or been in this message season it's really easy for us to to to determine who's speaking to us does it bring you down into condemnation tell you that you're not going to make it tell it that you're unworthy tell you that you're just never gonna Never Gonna amount to anything the Rapture is not for you this message isn't for you yeah it might be true but it's not for you it didn't come to you it didn't call your name now that's easy to identify yeah that's right why would God come down and tell you that he wouldn't God's not going to change his pattern despite your weakness so it's easy to identify if the word if the words that are coming into your mind are bringing you down it's not of God so if you're reading the message of the hour and that quote has got you so terribly vexed and you just think I don't know if I'm gonna make it you're not reading it the right way you're not reading it under the spirit that the prophet preached it in but the prophet preached it under the spirit of Liberty under the spirit of Grace under the spirit of Mercy under the spirit of love the Capstone of this age is love so if you're not hearing love when you hear it go back and listen to it again it's easy to discern if it's taking you out of the myri clay it's the right spirit amen not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord it's by the spirit of How It's brought right now now men have taken this message and graffitied all over it and maybe say what they wanted to say and took this and twisted this and manipulated this and you know what really it's not all their fault because how many remembers uh 30 years ago I don't know how many of the message 30 years ago I'm 30 I'm gonna be 36 next week remember 30 30 years ago we couldn't just pull out our phone and search what the prophet said it it just wasn't there you had to know somebody who knew somebody who had a stack of books or and then you had to go through that book and try to find exactly what you were looking for out of 1200 messages well at that time it was only 1100 messages you had to go through and find what you were looking for out of all these books or you knew somebody that had a computer right and you had to wait with this list of questions and when you got to them you'd say I want to look up all these things and that was how we had to take the message in I remember being just a little guy and that's how that's how that's how brothers would do it my dad would just read books books I'm looking for a quote I'm looking for a quote and now I could just pick up my phone I can just type in a few catchphrase words boom we're blessed Church young people you might not realize it but you're blessed the word is in full View you see you used to have to come to a holy man that had the whole Complete Book and he would only give you the part of the quote that he wanted you to hear are we okay I don't know how we got here but come on and he would only say what he wanted you to hear out of that book and he would say well this is what the prophet said and you would say let me see but all the excuses are off the table now we have a revelated word God has used the weapon of technology for our good and has opened the word unto us that is to whosoever will thirst let him come let him come because you can have the whole word all you've got to do is download an app and you can search the entire word you don't have to go over to a holy man's house and ask for it but you see the church is beginning to steer to this man or to this man or to this man because they were the only one with the food but we're not in that age anymore we're not in the age where we have to wait on this one or that one or what does he say about this but we can actually go and hear what the prophet said about it in the spirit that he set it in and we can hear him shouting and we can hear him running around and you see that's why Perugia Was Defeated because there is actually a presence of God yeah but when you couldn't hear the tape for yourself it was always a dry sermon but when you hear the prophet's voice he's running around the table and he's begging on the table seven times why because he wanted you to hear the voice Hallelujah I don't know how we got here friends but back in those days there was there was a lot of labels put over a lot of things well don't act too crazy or you're Pentecostal don't act too crazy or fanatic or you know that was those are the dead birds up there and they just they just want the word the word the word but we want the power and you see all these divisions taking place right yeah putting their own word over the top of the original message and all these divisions the schisms and elbows rubbing and yeah and just friction and but we're not there anymore that's not our fight that's an old fight I believe we're a Joshua generation four is down here in caterers barnia let what's been done been done that's what been scoring been scoring we're moving into the promised land where a Joshua generation chosen to overcome every opposition in this age I'm not gonna let some old fight keep me from my victory well I can't go over there because of this well I can't do this because of this that's an old fight and I say it's time to move on into perfection lay aside the waist and so easily beset us and let us move on press come on press into the Promised Land so back in this day just 20 or 30 years ago I remember my dad had this set of red volume books it was all the set you remember sis it was all that you know this is and he would that's how he studied brother he had these books and he just I mean and they had red duct tape on him he had studied them so much and he was just reading through him reading through him well one day his steel book went missing his favorite book he was devastated well you can't just go get another one the brother was making him and passed away and so on and so forth he couldn't just go replace it so he went on for a couple years and just you know he had he had Pages printed out and he was preaching on messages and this was back in the mid late 80s early 90s and we go over to this brother's house in another state and we're sitting there around the living room and he's got his bookshelf and he's got the whole red volume set my dad I wanted to read this quote out of the steel but begins to flip through it and yeah yeah there it is there it is it's like that looks like my handwriting oh he flips a few pages back and I've made the note in the same place that you made it that looks like my handwriting right there and he flips to the back of the bug it's certainly not surely not no sure enough says this guy's name right there man we've got the same hand right not only do we have the same handwriting we've got the same revelation Shane that with this scripture and this and this and this it's all written right here yeah we've got this we're in the same channel it was about this time I was probably just a little bit younger than you and I remember things got weird in the room I just remember looking around I'm not a very spiritual guy but I could pick up that things begin to get odd I thought man something's not right here right he's flipping through the book and the brother's kind of fidgeting a little bit yeah yeah yeah you know you know you know how it is you're under the same anointing The Same Spirit my Dad flips in the back of the book it just I saw where his name was just a little bit of a curl on that label that was there you thought no there's no way Jordan they got really weird and he just rips off the label and his name is under that label he said this guy stole my book oh I didn't know I didn't know you didn't know it was mine and then it got really weird in the room well my wife must have done that and so they agreed to disagree and you know so on and so forth but you see how easy it is to put a label over the top of something else and if you don't know the original source of that you might think that that's the testimony of your life you might think that defeated is how your life finishes you might think that upset or angry or alone or afraid or or uh just a Castaway might be the end of your testimony but we've got to look at that little corner where the label's at we've got to look down there with that Able's been put over because there is a table on the heart of a man a fleshly table that a label cannot touch a false Doctrine cannot touch but there is a there is original mark on the heart of a child of God that God put there not with ink but by his eternal thought he has been there since before there ever was time your origin of God there is not another one like you there's not an impersonator of you there's that a doppelganger of you you are the only one you're the thought of God that has come forth in this age and God did not send you here to fail God did not send thoughts forward to fail but God sent thoughts of Victory to overcome the world he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world it's him in you doing the work because his thought is already in there why so much hurt why so much why so much sickness in murders and killing and in the back part of the mind of God there was attributes that needed to be expressed and and we we're there fellowshipping Brother Juan in the back part of the mind of God and we're we're we're we're having we're having Fellowship but God's got attributes he wants to express that's right oh I've got it within me to be a Healer healer what's that sure there's never been a sickness what's the sickness oh it's a you know it's something in your body I'll go sure yeah and those attributes in God begin to need to be expressed I have an attribute inside me to be a savior but none's lost I'll go send me Lord here am I and these thoughts begin to come into God's mind said I have an attribute to be a comforter but there's nobody in discomfort I'll go I've got an attribute to have an anointing on the people so much that they can walk into a fiery furnace they could walk into a lion's den they can be torn apart they can be sawing asunder they could be they could they could be they could be torn in half and mothers killed in front of their children and vice versa I've got to have an anointing so much to show that I can be a comforter and there was thoughts that came for the Dark Ages and the martyrs and there was thoughts he thought he thought I have to have a thought of a man who will Who will grow up in the ranks of religion and know everything in and in and out of the scripture and he'll know all the Scrolls and he'll speak seven languages and he'll know everything there is to know but one day I'm gonna come and knock him off his high horse and he's gonna humble himself and he's gonna preach a dirty gospel that came through somebody he thought was of no value but he's gonna recognize the message and Paul came in the mind of God and there was a thought of Paul that come forth and he would be the messenger to that age I don't have a thought of somebody who had the courage to defy the highest Authority in the land and they'll tape and decree over his door and he'll show up to the church one day and he'll rip the decree off his door and he said we're gonna have church and a thought of Martin Luther came into the mind of God and it began to come forth in these these thoughts of the Masterpiece begin to come out and the mind of the artist began to be revealed and he began to and thoughts begin to come out Through the Ages you thought my it's a beautiful work it's very good what I've done but I've got to finish it I've got to cap this masterpiece I need somebody who'll go in the darkest age where there's sin on every door where's the days of Sodom all over again whereas the the days of Noah all over again where there's there's technology and and and and pervertedness and everything on every corner but I need somebody who will go there without even a physical presence to look to right but they'll go there with the confidence to know that I sent them and I sent my word with them and I said here am I I said God I'll go I'll go to the darkest stage you know that that the seven vials of the ages and that last age is really dark but there's that little bit there that's not empty space prince it's light it's where the light is and God said I've got to have a thought that will walk in the light in the darkest in flesh and was dwelts among them and those works that he did they also did because it was him and them doing the works and they had to come mission to fulfilling that age they would be the final voice we're not just here by chance but we've been given the greatest privilege we've been given the most Authority out of any church gone by the same Authority that was given on Mount Transfiguration is given to the church in this age this is my beloved Son hear ye him I don't believe it was just for our sheep wave I believe it's for us I believe it's for the church right now what are we doing with the goods that we have my Authority authority over every Spirit but Abraham would wait for it wait for it he would say he's here right I take every Spirit under my control my message is to declare to the church he is here and if he's here he's already taken every spirit is is under submission to his control and his will and you might think that I can't get this thing off of me oh yes you can you be a greater power than you than you've been given the greater Authority than you realize God has sent his word not that you can deal with circumstances not that you can just deal with the situations in your life but that you could overcome every enemy oh every enemy but this one know every enemy [Applause] everyone under the commission of the Holy Spirit every spirit is subject under that Joshua be the Fulfillment of that in those five Kings yeah without time to get into it but Joshua didn't didn't kill those five Kings he called his five generals over and he said you put your foot on the neck of that enemy you put your foot on the neck of imagination if you of sickness you put your foot on the devil that's rocks you down you do it the Joshua commission to the church is for you to do it him and you doing the works we have the authority I'm not gonna back down I'm not gonna Retreat I'm not gonna give up this message has not lost power but it's as strong today as it ever was I could stay stronger because there's more of us believing what he said if I could just get five well I've got news there's more than five Elijah said I'm the only one but there was seven thousand already there but remember if I could just get five but if God would allow him to see through time and see this church in this end time walking in step with the word fulfilling the commission which they be given yeah here we are the church has come the hour is not it's time to rise under authority of the adoption of sons and unto them he gave power somebody say power I didn't give unto us weakness to retreat but he gave unto us power to become the Sons and Daughters of God under authority of the word where my daddy's from he's King his word is the final word and I am his ambassador to this earth I have the same authority of which he has I I'm join heirs with Christ and about being joined heirs then I'm enjoying power am I being joining power I'm enjoying Authority if I'm enjoy Authority I'm enjoying commission to fulfill every word that's been given to the church in this age I've got news for the devil we're not giving up we're not turning around I'm not going back to where I came from you're not gonna scare me or intimidate me away from this but I have been given a commission and authority to walk into every promise that's in the word because it's speaking of me because it's calling my name and it said Abraham and they called him by name it's been to Israel here but the but the H in the Hebrew language you know what it is it's a breath you cannot say Abraham without putting breath into it and saber hum it's a breath so God caused life to come into Abram who was once just a dead seed there but when he breathed the breath of life into him he became the expressed image of what was in the back part of the mind of God and Abraham came into existence well I gotta say to the church tonight we're not just stuck with our dead Creeds we're not in some tradition we're not in some denomination but the Breath of God Almighty has come into the church in this hour and he's breathed the breath of life and changed our name that's right I think it's time we wash our board clean well I just barely made it in here why don't you wash it off yeah why don't you wash off that old word and say I'm walking out of here with Victory I walked in here not knowing if I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost why don't you wash that off and know that you know that you know that you know why don't you wash off whatever the world called you and why don't you say what God has already called you wash it off what does your board say let me say this I'll try to close here young man what's your name huh Emmanuel you know you know what LeBron James is you know what Michael Jordan is you know who sponsors them Nike Nike sponsors them you know what Nike means victory it's the Greek symbol of victory so Nike has sponsored these these men that that play basketball because they want them to represent Victory and they don't just put their sponsorship to anybody but they only give that sponsorship to the best because they are going to represent their brand they're going to represent what they stand for Nike stands for victories they're not just going to give it to some benchwarmer somewhere they're only going to give it to the all-star because they want them to represent the power that they are Nike is victory in the Sports World this brother back here is wearing a Nike shirt it means Victory it's the it's the Greek symbol of Victory so you walked in here with Victory on your shirt you might not have recognized it but you walked in here with Victory on your shirt this brother here is wearing Nike you walked in with Victory on your shirt you see you might not have noted coming in but that's what it means he revealed now I'm not preaching about Nike but Nike doesn't give LeBron James a sponsorship lest he signed a contract yeah yeah and LeBron James has to sign this contract that he's gonna only wear Nike material he can't show up to the game wearing Adidas he can't show up to the game wearing Reebok ram1 he's Gotta Wear Nike 's his sponsor and so he signed this contract and not only did they give him all the clothes he needs they give him shoes socks close day clothes basketball clothes any kind of clothes he wants headbands finger sleeves they give him everything he has need of and 200 million dollars and his only requirement is he has to perform to represent the Nike emblem and if he starts slacking off the Nike is going to call him and say hey you're booted go call in one right but he's Victorious so Nike wants him to represent them Tiger Woods Nike represents Tiger Woods Cristiano Ronaldo they're sponsors Nike doesn't just give that sponsor to anybody they're look at all the names I just listed you've all heard of them why because they're superstars in the sports world right you know brother bam said that Christ came in this age to sponsor us and he's given us sponsorship in this age now he didn't just come to sponsor anybody or a make-believer or so and so but Christ came in this age to sponsor the real believer because his brand is Victory his brand is overcoming his brand is never defeated never lost a battle never retreated and how could we properly represent that sponsorship walking into the house of God defeated and down and depressed no you can only you've signed a contract friend you've signed a contract and he has provided everything that you have Meetup he's provided your clothes your food your house your bill money he's provided he's provided Health he's provided family he's provided healing he's provided everything that you have need of and Provisions for the future and how could we walk in here well I hope I win today man you're wearing the Nike humble and it's so much more than a Nike emblem God put there before the foundation of the world and he signed it with his own name you're wearing the name of Christ and if you're wearing the name of Christ you better represent what Christ would do Christ is not just gonna go off in the corner somewhere and say well I wish the preacher was preaching to me today no Christ is the worst and wherever the word is that's gonna be he's gonna be right in the middle of it saying preach buddy preach yes that's right because he knows what the word is and when the word is cast upon a seed the seed response it says that's nothing but the truth yeah and let me tell you a secret Church it don't take an lld or a PhD or some degree from some college and don't even take proper English but when the word Goes Forth and it strikes the seed all's the reply needs to be is that ain't nothing but the truth can we all say that tonight that ain't nothing but the truth [Music] oh you don't know how far gone my prodigal is you don't know how far gone those two boys were but if it worked for Hattie Wright it'll work for you mama if it worked for Hattie ride it'll work for you Andy if it weren't for Hattie ride it'll work for you brother that ain't nothing but the truth it don't take a work up it don't take a shout you just gotta believe the word and March on friends we're not defeated we're not cast down I feel like brother one that that boy brother bam talks about when he says he he says uh the Emancipation Proclamation day he says one of those slaves was faster than the other one right and they were not believing it some say nah it's not true they're we're not really free just get back to work get back to work he says no no I'm not gonna get back to work I'm free right I'm free I'm not gonna listen to you or him or anybody else I'm free I'm gonna go free and that that man ran faster than everybody else and you know what he did he didn't just clear the hill and keep running when he got to where he could see where there was freedom and liberty and rejoicing he stood up on the hill and he said hey we're free we're free [Applause] whom the son has made free is free it's not my fault if you stay in the bars I've said you're free you said you're free the message claim to declare you're free we just gotta take a step into freedom take a step into Liberty take a step into Authority take a step into the full word it's our commission friends this is why we've been put here Hallelujah the music players will come we're free yeah yes yes I don't care what the back can say about me or with the Presbyterian say about me I don't care where the Pentecostals say about me I'm free I'm free to worship I'm free to praise him I'm free to enjoy the word I'm free to read it day and night and Night and Day I'm free to do it whenever I want it's our choice if we stay in captivity I say it's time to go free maybe you didn't recognize that you've been sponsored by Christ but now you know amen he didn't just sponsor you but he put his name on you yeah that's right his reputation that's right everything that he represents in this fought for everything that he is is riding on you now God wouldn't just do that to anybody [Music] he knows you're Victorious you might look like a block of granite to everybody else out there but he knows he knows what happens when you just get into his hands my friends maybe you feel like you don't have any value why don't you just get in the Master's Hand yes remember brother Brandon would tell that story about that Old Violin is sitting there in the corner all dusty and nobody played it and it was just there all tarnished and worn out and the auctioneer would start to auction it off he said what do I have for this Old Violin a dollar 50 cents 25 cents a nickel nobody wanted it nobody would buy it nobody raised their hand and maybe tonight young person you feel that way you feel like you're not worth a nickel maybe nobody would come and vouch for you and stand up for you maybe not pay a quarter for you and what value do I have for this move of God but all of a sudden they were about to just close out the auction and Let It Go that old man came from the crowd he grabbed the violin and began to play a piece on it you begin to play there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins where Sinners plunge beneath the flood we begin to play this melody and the violin was so powerful that everybody in that oxygen just was filled with tears filled with tears the auctioneer was crying and all the bitters were crying and the old man was crying and the violin was just doing what it does [Music] it back to the auctioneer now this is the same violin he didn't polish it he didn't clean it he handed it back after it had been touched by the master oh yes what do I have for the violin two thousand three thousand four thousand five thousand the same violin but in the hands of the master became Priceless and you might feel like you're not worth anything but why don't you get back in the mess of the Matter's hands when's the last time you let God have his way in your life when's the last time you say Lord I don't want any of me I just want to be played by you I just want you to play me Lord Play This Old Violin it's Rusty it's old it's tarnished all but when it's in the Master's hands oh Hallelujah begins to be a piece of art but you see value comes by a revelation not what a man says I can tell you you're you're this or I could tell you you're that but it's just words less it come by Revelation but when God ever strikes it within the heart of a Believer I died for you yeah I went to the cross for you yeah I thought you were worth it I thought you were worth saving I thought my I thought you were worse spilling my blood when that Revelation strikes the heart of a man I can't talk you out of it I can't tell you you're worthless there's no amount of of psychology I could give you that would talk you out of that Victory because it's been revealed to you yes that he died for you and you alone that comes at a time of Revelation [Music] [Applause] [Music] nurse Plus we need [Music] us [Music] I wonder if we can just stand and seen this Hallelujah [Music] [Music] play [Music] place [Music] [Applause] [Music] tonight let it wash your board please deny in that video [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] friends I think about this we just play that maybe you walked in here with a lot of different things on your board a lot of things just labeled over you maybe some church labeled over you or some man or some woman or some fear or some devil some lie label something over your life and you thought you'd walk that way the rest of your life there's the blood think about this I know it's I know it's hot guys we just worship him I think about this thank you brother Brandon will come into a into an insane Institution one time not knowing what to do there's people crazy and straight jackets screaming running around and he's just a man without a commission of the word just a man standing there you thought Lord what am I gonna do here watch what would I do here and just as he thought that a young lady walks up to him that was a nurse there she says are you are you brother random he says yes she said well I'm so glad you're here he says where do I even start yeah young lady looks at him and says I wish you'd start with me he said start with you I said are you a patient here she said yes I'm a patient here I said well you don't look like a patient she said well would you like to hear my story friends God always wants to hear your story he's always got time to hear the details she begins to express to him her story of how she didn't think she'd end up there she was born in a good Christian home good Christian parents just a little bit by a little bit the devil began to paint other names on top of her [Music] started dating this boy and her parents told her not to she did it anyway and that boy began to begin to woo her away from her security we were away from the church the man says that boy poisoned her drink and took something from her that she would never get back she thought she'd be like that the rest of her life wasn't her fault she disobeyed one word and that's where she [Music] 'd being a Christian girl she thought condemnation she'd never get free from it I'll just go to church and I'll just pretend like it never happened but it wore on her and it wore on her and it wore on her until she didn't come back to church no more she found herself out in drugs and alcohol and and a whole different scene altogether parents lost touch with her felt too condemned to keep in contact with him I believe the Lord's saying this for a reason she's in and out of Institutions she said I I came to be a Catholic thinking I'd get free from it and I went into the Catholic school and there they they said this this and this and they gave me some psychology and they gave me some pills and they sent me on my way in just a few months I was doing the same thing I was doing before that went in there but worse I've been in this is my second institution I've been in he said well you don't look crazy so do you believe that it's a spirit that makes you do that she said I've always thought that but they told me that wasn't that wasn't real it was just mind over matter and I just had to get over it but the prophet of God there face to face whatever tells her it's a spirit that's making you do those things and you can be free from that you could be free from that Spirit she thought I just thought I'd be this way my whole life he said don't you want to be a good wife to somebody I would love that more than anything but who would have me Larry me and he says I know somebody that will [Music] I that'll take you how you are I know a guy that'll come right down to where you're at in the middle of your sin in the middle of your confusion and he'll marry you he said why don't we pray this Spirit off of you she got down on her knees and he said he had just begun to enter into prayer the anointing barely touched down she felt a little bit of emotion and stood up and said glory to God I'm free he said Oh no you're not sis he said you're just turning the page if you walk out that door you'll be exactly the same way you are you'll be bound and you'll never be free from that thing he said why don't you just why don't you just give it to God why don't you just surrender all that you are why don't you take the label that Satan put over your life and tear it off and recognize you're a daughter of God he said they even got down and began to pray and the anointing of God dropped down there he said with snot and tears they began to get deliverance from that spirit and she got she got free from that thing and said I'm free glory to God I'm free he said now she's a Deacon's wife in a church with a family is anything too hard for our God my friends I don't know you I've never seen many of you before I don't know what's on your mind on your heart but I wonder if we'd have the faith like that little woman did and say Lord start with me you want a Revival in this place start with me you want a Revival to help break upon the young people in this neighborhood Lord start with me this church should go into higher places it's ever been Lord start with me you want the Miracles to return the days of Miracles to come back into the house of God say Lord start with me here I am unworthy father Lord every every eye closed Lord of hands are raised it's by faith father Lord I I recognize that there's a presence in this room it's not not from a man but Lord you're here to do something father pray that there'd be an outcry from a heart to say Lord start with me Lord I want to be different than I came in I want to be changed and I came in Father oh I want to be free from all this mind battle I want to be free from all this condemnation I want to be free from all this turmoil in my spirit I just get so wadded up I can't even enjoy the word because I think it's not for me I want to be free from that father I pray that if there's someone within the sound of my voice that's caught in bondage I'm sure in this word is not for them I rebuke that Spirit of the word take your take your leave from that child of God oh friend if you could see it the way God sees you you're his revealed masterpiece he didn't just put you here but he thought so delicately about you he thought about every angle in detail and he puts you here to fulfill his commission his purpose his word and this hour well father I I pray that you start with me Lord father let the word transform start with me father [Music] father I pray you start with me [Music] rejoice [Music] or may I see [Music] away [Music] oh why don't you just let it

that was uh the dying teeth rejoice to see the fountain in his day while we were singing that I just saw the picture in my mind Zachariah said there will be a fountain in the house of Debbie [Music] now all the time that young man living and doing everything [Music] how Revelation came in that hour that last hour of his life with his hands stretched on the Roman port his feet kneeled [Music] that he could just turn his shoulder and said Lord remember me [Music] that's the only thing he said Remember Me and by inspiration that this writer would say the dying teeth saw the fountain that Zechariah spoke about [Music] now I want to say tonight we come to church and just to have the time being in this in this hot building [Music] but I would say that the grace of God has come down tonight [Music] and the Holy Spirit was able to move in such a way I want to encourage you and I also want to challenge you tonight [Music] if you are dealing with anger if you are dealing with some sense of frustration [Music] whatever you are dealing with and you know that you are dealing with now that you're starting you are beginning to think in your mind what am I dealing with but what you know that you are dealing with [Music] think about yourself being stretched on the Roman pole there is no way you can imagine that that was a capital punishment they put their nails through your vein the weight of your body is pulling you off the cross and you have just those Nails holding you back [Music] it's a place where all hope is gone it's a place where there is no way out you are not coming down the Romans make sure that you are not coming down there is no way you can you can ease your pain the pain is constant the pain is there [Music] I don't know about you but I I just don't want this service to be just another service [Music] that we will make the sacrifice to be here just because we want to have another service you know where you are dealing with you know where you are dealing with you know what is on your mind you know where the enemy trying to trouble you and him you know the place in your life where he's trying to create distrust [Music] just before we come to the close of the service tonight whether you are a young man and whether you are a young woman this is brother Ron the first time preaching this in this church he just met brother Jordan back there and remember that he knew one another back in Arizona [Music] he flew in today I never met him we never met until he drove to service tonight and for him to just go right I knew that the Holy Spirit was speaking because I was just listening to the message uh he are the light of the word and brother Brandon was talking about billboard so as soon as he said that I could say it out hungry 30 miles to hell [Music] because the Holy Spirit just there with me this afternoon and there caught an inspiration from there [Music] I don't know about you but I'm sitting there and I'm hearing the things that he's saying in a different places that the Holy Ghost is leading him to talk about [Music] and I'm sure there's a brother uh I wouldn't believe the other foreign if Jesus was in a copper body tonight [Music] if the Lord Jesus Christ was in the physical body in this building tonight and this whole Community didn't know that he was here and just few of us that I gathered here tonight I don't know what you will have done will it just be enough for you to sit there and just look at his face and say is this really my Lord we'll just be enough maybe you might have slept up your phone to take a picture of him is that all you have done tonight or will you have been and say I waited for this moment [Music] that woman married that came by and saw Jesus Simon has invited him and he's sitting there and everybody looking people taking selfie with Jesus [Music] they are pointing and telling their little child you see him that he's the miracle worker but she didn't sit there she didn't stop she came forward she took a step forward because she was burdened with something there was something she was tired with and she realized that she had she had this this is her moment I don't know if it's your moment tonight we have gone past the day where we have to beg people because the walls that are coming forth are the ones that have got a revelation under I've seen the fountain in the House of David a fountain drained from Emmanuel vein the dying teeth saw it I don't know if you saw it tonight but that Fountain broke in this building and said you are free that Fountain broke in this building you have no reason to go back and be haunted with with evil habits you have no reason to give yourself a reason why you should keep doing what you are doing when you know that you're not happy about it you know that it's not pleasing you you just trap into it you can break free tonight I don't know about you tonight Saints I don't know what about you tonight but you see sometimes God takes the unusual movement sometimes God will calm down [Music] in a place that looks very uncomfortable he will come down in in a simple way that God will inspire our brother he brought up he brought us an image that capture our mind [Music] and brought us a word that drive down our spirit for our soul to be felt tonight I don't know what about you I don't know what you're thinking in your mind I don't know what is occupying your mind more than the word that was preached tonight all the dying teeth saw the fountain in his days he saw the fountain that Zechariah spoke about I don't know if you see that tonight I don't know if you have seen the power that was released tonight to break you free [Music] oh sweet Jesus oh sweet Jesus oh sweet Jesus [Music] oh sweet Jesus what a merciful god you
