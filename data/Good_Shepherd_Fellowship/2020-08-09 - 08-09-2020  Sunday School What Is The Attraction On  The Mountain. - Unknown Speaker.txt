========================================

[Music] behold today cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay all that do wickly shall be as stubbles now this is not that's malcolm 3 was the first coming now here's the next coming even the dr scofield here i certainly don't agree with him in these footnotes but he's got it lined out here right the commission of john the malachi 3 and the second coming of christ and elijah before hands all the proud shall burn up saith the lord of hosts and it shall leave them neither root nor branch where's the eternal hell in but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise with healing campaigns healing in his wings you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in that day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts remember the law of moses my servant which i commanded him in horeb for all israel the statues and judgment here's the coming of elijah behold i will send to you elijah the prophet the last closing scripture of the old testament i'll send to you elijah the prophet before the coming of that great and dreadful day of the lord now that couldn't have been john no see the world wasn't burned up the righteous walked out on the wicked no no before the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse notice the accuracy of the holy spirit that it would not confuse them two comings of elijah malachi 3 said behold i send my messenger before my face jesus asked about john he said if you can receive it this is who the prophet said i'll say my messenger before my face this is the elias that was to come malachi 3 notice the scripture so accurately gives it watch what this to show the thumb who wants to believe them who wants to see remember jesus stopped in the middle of a scripture because part of it was fulfilled and to rest for his second coming to preach the acceptable year of the lord bind up the brokenhearted and stop not bring judgment to the gentiles until his second coming notice this scripture here parallels that and he elijah shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children now speaking of malachi 4 and i'll get it mixed from al qaeda 3 john elijah who came in the days before the first coming of christ turned the hearts of the old patriarch fathers to the message of the children the new message now watch and the hearts of the children to the fathers in his second coming in the last days he turns back to the apostolic faith again amen see how perfect the scriptures line up that was the end of the old testament the old testament now we see there's light in the evening time what is it it's the top mount treetop as i said this morning we've come up through denominations through not an orange tree like uh spoke of this morning but we've had grapefruit lemons all kinds of other things that wasn't like the beginning at all but after don't miss it here it comes after all the denominations is played out they didn't have any light you begin with there'll be a day that can't be called day or night what are they doing what are they doing what does a a lemon do on an orange tree it takes the original life of the arms that's coming up and perverts it through a lemon that's what the denomination has done to the word of god made the word of god of no effect by their traditions that's thus saith the spirit of the lord they have brought forth lemons grapefruits not oranges but what did the prophet say the same one that said for our text tonight rejoice old daughters of jerusalem shout loud daughters of zion are your kings coming to you meek and lowly setting up on the fall of an ass notice that same prophet said there will come a time of the ripening of the sun set up on the earth to ripen the fruit why couldn't it ripen there's no fruit there to ripen but the life is still traveling on it come up to a grapefruit to be an orange found out it organized it was a grapefruit it went again it come out that time of lemon but on again it turned out to something else and in the last top of the tree it's turned out to a tangelo which is half orange half lemon a mixed breed a perverted thing come on to a perversion living off that same tree the shock almost deceived the elect it looks like an orange but it ain't but it shall be life when she grows beyond organization when she gets out of pass organization it blooms out again she'll put forth oranges like she was when she went into the ground and then it shall be light what's this attraction what's this happening fulfilling god's word there's two witnesses of the old testament that this would happen let's take john 14 12 of the new testament jesus said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also also in luke 17 22 to 30 he said as it was in the days of lot for sodom has burned so shall it be at the return of the son of man that day when the son of man is being revealed oh just look at the scriptures the son of man jesus christ the same yesterday forever grow to pass denominations throw it into the top of the tree what did he say in john 14 or 15 every bridge that's in me that doesn't bring forth the fruit it'll be cut off and pruned thrown into the fire and burn whatever branch that'll bring forth fruit it'll be purged oh there will be a true former and latter reign in the last days upon that little group that come with him on this little donkey low and humble no doubt or denomination crying hold santa to the king that comes in the name of the lord what's the matter today what's the attraction on the mount not long ago standing this pulpit it was said by the holy spirit the day will come that when they'll drive down a stake in front of your house they'll move your gate thought you'll bypass it not be angry i seen my gate tore up laying out upon the hill sign i seen the hill in front of me all dug up boards and things laying there worse somebody mashed it up he said i looked and there was a little ricky that had got up there and knocked that gate out done this i said why didn't you tell me you got smart with me and i had to hit him and when it did i said i haven't done this since i was in the ring but i just want you to know and i swatted him on and when i knocked him down i picked him up again knocked him down again i picked it up three or four times and kicked him over the hill so then i went over there and i said that ain't right i picked him up and shook his hands i said i'm not angry with you but i just want you to know you can't talk to me like that and then when i turned and come back the holy spirit was standing at the gate said now bypass this when that stakes drove down turned westward this book is everything that i need this book is a good recipe the way the show was to go around my trouble amen that book is the word and that word is god bypass your troubles it'll tell you what to do three years ago i heard a friend of mine the city surveyor lives down the lane from me driving a stake down i went out there and said what's the matter mud mr king son personal friend said billy they're going to widen this road you all remember yeah i said it may be the bridge i told brother woods i said hold your property maybe that bridge is going to come through up here something to lane was tore up bricks rocks brought all over everything so he said i said hold your property and then when i mr king told me that was going to happen i went instead of my wife sitting there honey there's something written about that thus saith the lord somewhere i went and got my book looked into it it said it shall come to pass eight years later then when i looked at it i said it's time now honey we must turn west two days after that standing in the room about ten o'clock one morning us went into the spirit of god i saw that little cluster of doves flying look at them little birds you remember amen i've seen seven angels in the form of a pyramid come rushing into me said turn westward go to tucson be 40 miles northeast and you'll be picking a huckleberry or a bullhead or they call it there off your clothes brother fred sophman's sitting there looking at me right now was there that morning i forgot about it i said a blast went off like an earthquake that shook pretty near everything there was in the country i don't see how a man could survive it i was scared i stood at phoenix you always singing tonight bear me record i preached on the sermon sirs what time is it where are we at i went west many of you here got that tape many of you here heard it said year or more for it happened i went west wondering what was going to happen one day i got a call from the lord i told my wife i said honey i'm probably my work is over i didn't know i said bro god's probably finished with me now and i'll be going home you go get with billy take your children god will make a way for you somehow want to live true to god see if the children get through school raise them in the administration of god she said bill you don't you don't know that's true i said no but a man couldn't survive that one morning the lord woke me up said get up your sabine attention i took a piece of paper and my bible the wife said where are you going i said i don't know i'll tell you when i come back i went up in the canyon climb plumb up where the eagles was flying around i was watching some deer standing there i knelt down to pray and raised up my hands and a sword struck my hand i looked around i thought what's that i'm not beside myself here's that sword in my hand bright shiny glistening in the sun i said no there's not people in miles anyway if you're in this canyon where could that come from i heard a boy said that's the king sword i said a king knights a man with a sword e the voice come back said not a king sword but the king's sword amen the word of the lord said fear not it's only the third pole it's the vindication of your ministry i was going hunting with a friend not knowing what was going to happen and someone called me the one who criticized me about that picture of the angel of the lord the one who took it i had to go to houston about his son or he's going in the death row he was going to be killed in a few days he met me there and thrown his arms around he said thank the very man that i criticized comes to save my only son you mean society give me a what they call an oscar or whatever you want to call it we're saving a life then we went back i went up in the mountain to hunt there brother fred and i one morning when i walked down i'd already got my javelina and i looked and seen the place for the one i said brother fred go over on that mountain early in the morning now about to break a day and i'll get on the other i won't shoot at the hog won't kill him but if they start over this way that hurt i'll shoot in front of him and run him back brother fred went out there and there's no hogs he waved at me and i seen i went down in a canyon some big chasms sun is just coming up i come around the other side of the hill not thinking nothing about the prophecies sit down waiting resting i thought what happened to those hogs i picked up my sat down like indians do you know cross-legged i looked on my overhaul leg and there was a bullheader i picked it up i said that's strange here i am about 40 miles northeast of tucson there's my little boy joseph sitting there waiting for me and as i started to look i've seen a herd of hogs come out about a thousand yards from me up on a mountain i throw the bullheader down i said i'll get him i'll go get forever fred and i'll hang up a piece of paper let know which way to go on this old katia here and well get brother friend i started up the mountain running as hard as he could on the other side all of a sudden i thought somebody shot me i never heard such a blast that shook the whole country and when it did standing before me with seven angels in a cluster met brother fred and emily said what was that that was it what are you going to do return home for thus saith the lord the seven mysteries that's been hid in the bible all these years these denominations and everything god is going to open those seven mysteries to us in the seven seals there was that circle coming up from the earth like a mist forming when it did it went from up into the mountain began to circle on westward from the way it come science founded at wild 30 miles high and 25 miles across just exactly in the circle of the pyramid and the other day standing there turn the picture to the right and there's jesus as he was in the seven church ages the white wig on showing supreme deity he's alpha albiga he's the first and the last he is the supreme judge of all eternity standing there to confirm the message of this hour and there shall be light about the evening time what's it all about what was it i went westward up on that same mountain passing up with banks woods there said throw up a rock say to mr woods thus saith the lord you'll see the glory of god the very next day he's standing there a whirlwind came down and blasted the mountains out rocks cut the top of the trees off about three or four feet above my head made three big blasts the brothers come run over there was about 15 man stand there preachers and everything else what was it he said what was it i said judgment is striking the west coast about two days after that their earthquake almost sunk alaska what is this light up on sunset mountain in the carnota artists of arizona what is this strange thing that happened up there that the people's been driving east from west picking up the rocks that laid around their horse truck and every one of every one rock has three corners on it that it tore off the 3r1 they're laying on dust on paperweights across the nation what is this strange thing up on sunset mountain in the carnotal forest junior jackson listening in you remember the dream he had it on turpin going towards the setting of the sun and this happened on sunset mountain it's the evening time sunset time the sunset message to a setting of history a setting of prophecy rather being fulfilled and it shall be like at the evening time up on sunset mountain in the coronado forest 40 miles north of tucson get on the map and see if sunset peak there that's exactly where it happened i never knew it the other day everything that shall never die it's constantly unrolling itself from the very thing happening to the picture being jesus standing looking at us and now exactly on sunset mountain and the sunset light the evening light has come god vindicating himself what is it it is the facts that god in christ are one the white how many seen at the white wig upon him as we talked in revelation one see the supreme deity supreme authority no other voice no other god nor than nothing in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily the angels themselves was his wig amen what's happening up on mount sunset god confirming his word that's what all this noise is about notice it's god fulfilling his promised word again of revelations 10 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh angels message the mystery of god should be finished the hidden mystery of revelations 10 1-7 the last message to the last church age fulfills exactly in this age saint luke 17 30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed and there shall rise false prophets and false christ show great signs and monitors insomuch to deceive the elected if possible that people still in doubt and as usual the church is just as puzzled and the science all through tucson yet they're writing pieces and put the paper way back over on mount lim and then big cameras didn't see it rising up from where we were standing drifting on towards the west showing the time is over he can't go over a little piece there it's at the west coast judgment struck just the very way it went going right up over phoenix right on across on to prescott across the mountains to the west coast right on up into where was they going right on up into alaska and she's thundering heading right that way and the observatories and all of them and tucson are still asking research of science trying to find out what it is so high there can't be fog mist or nothing up there what did it where's it at they're just as puzzled at that supernatural halo hanging out in the sky as it was when the magis come in following a star saying where is he that's boring king of the jews what was it god fulfilling his word there shall rise a star out of jacob and the god of heaven promised the evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir but now it's history it's past the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir and what's this attraction god fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever let us pray dear god i have helped the people at length much longer than i intended i pray god that something was said or done that will cause people out everywhere to understand and by seeing and understanding they might believe that god the true christ and the words that's being confirmed is a confirmation of his word being perfect and being fulfilled in its season now lord jesus from your own words you said that the world would be in a sodom condition we know that we can look at it and you said in that day as it was in sodom there was three messengers sent to the gentile and hebrew world and one of them which was god himself the son of man revealed himself in a human form and performed a miracle insomuch that told abraham what sarah was doing behind him in the tent you said it would repeat again when the whole gentile world would be in a sodom condition and we're here lord other prophecies confirming the same thing of sending elijah in the last days the spirit of elijah upon the earth to bring the hearts of the fathers or the children back to the fathers now pray god at this hour that you will confirm your word that you are the same yesterday today and forever granted father they are all yours i pray that you'll grant these blessings and confirm what's been said for the glory of god in the name of jesus christ amen just speak a word as a man confirm a word is god to say something is one thing god to do it is another thing god don't need any interpreter he does his own interpretation now we're fixing to have a prayer line to pray for the sacred god willing and we know that there's no one no man no woman no human being no angel that can heal you for god has already did it he made the preparation the only thing you have to do is receive it there's no man no angel no nothing not even god himself can forgive you for your sins it's already done jesus did that the cross but he'll never prosper you anything or profit you anything until you accept it the only thing can be done is orders that's been given by god for believers to lay hands on the sick that's been through the ages they've done that through revivals and they've called it god abraham's seen many signs but there come a time when abraham saw his last sign just before sodom was burned that was god manifesting himself in the form of a man you believe that did jesus say it would repeat now how many in here and out in radio or i don't have telephones across the nation if you're still listening in get ready now for prayer be free you just got these handkerchiefs here now i cannot tell god what to do no far be it from even trying it he's sovereign he does what he wants to i can only obey and i only can say what he says and now they're standing around the walls they're packed in as congested i wonder if we could ask god on these words what is this attraction if god would move among us again there may be strangers here and move among us and show his blessed face among us show his spirits here show that he's the same yesterday today and forever but every one of us after these two strong messages could believe it to be sold could you do it all right instead of calling a prayer line then hot congested standing against wall i look around this way to call them a prayer line you couldn't do it let's stand in there could i call it this way you're sick cots everything else laying you couldn't do it so set where you are and believe god if you do have a prayer card hold it it'll be good we'll get to you if you want to come to a line but you don't have to come to a line that mr shepherd last sunday night never come through no line i don't i don't guess he had a prayer card is mr shepherd here tonight or is he is he here he's in the bank do you have a prayer card mr shepherd you didn't you didn't he's sitting right there again tonight that's a good place to be brother shepard not only have to be there but just have faith but remember a little woman touched his garment and he felt it and he's the same yesterday and forever and the hebrew letter in the new testament said that he's a high priest tonight that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities you believe that have faith in don't doubt it believe it and it'll come to pass you could have what you what you've asked for if you can believe it but you've got to believe it will you do it well all of you believe it how many will believe it now god bless you i don't know who's who i don't know none of you it's not my business to know any of you it's god's business and all these things but he will do it if you'll believe it will you believe it now now dear god surely we're not a bunch of hybrid christians we shouldn't be somebody has to be petted and babied you don't have that kind lord you have rugged believers the very presence of god sets a man's heart on fire like abraham he believed god you made yourself known to him then you appeared to him and performed a sign and he believed you you turned his body back to a young man and also his wife which his wife was part of his own body then come forth the new child the promised son god you promised that it'd be the same thing in this day i pray that you'll confirm this word and we'll deal right on that one promise there that it will be like it was in sodom just before sodom was burnt and judgment struck sodom the gentile world so judgment is fixed and strength the gentile world and the jews got three and a half more years through the period of tribulation jacob's trouble the continuing of the 70 weeks of daniel but the gentiles are numbered it's time to go and you'll give that sign and you said it would be again granted god there we're in your hands do with us as you see fit in jesus christ's name amen [Music] you
