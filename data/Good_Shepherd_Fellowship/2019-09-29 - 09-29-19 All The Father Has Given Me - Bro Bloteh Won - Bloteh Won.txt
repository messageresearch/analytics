little bit here praise the Lord amen amen I mean it's so good to be in the house of the Lord amen we thank the Lord for his blessing upon our life and in the opportunity that he happens to be here this morning and rather how to go over to North Dakota yesterday morning in brought a team in all the brothers that send their greetings and we want to continue to remember those brothers down there and pray that the law will be able to help them they have some huge challenges there but we know that there is no challenge that is greater than I was gone amen praise the Lord you know while I was I was studying in the week I was listening to something reading a brilliant book actually and and he said that you know when you are flying on an aeroplane and as as how you go as high when the plane takes off and the planes that are going up the moment you get above altitude the things of the earth starts to lose shape and then when you start seeing things and can be able to identify them then you are losing attitude which means you are coming closer to the earth praise the Lord but as far as you are going from the earth the mole thing starts to lose shape just wondering what is down there you know just just looking in and it gets smaller and it gets smaller and then they disappear praise the Lord and and I believe that is it with the life of a child of God you know having something this morning for the young people I remember it many years ago was just a faded we can put my little my little quiz up some years back you know we had to be school because of the wall in different things so when I moved to the area cause I've already gone into the ministry and but I decided to go back to school so I had to take an entrance I remember this question and I prayed I never forget about it here I tear a leaf and how to take this math test and he had this question that is about angles our brother Jody he was asking about okay this is the question two angles that make a straight angle being out of school for a wide in Assad right there you know I pray before I went to take my test now I just sitting there now looking at the question two angles that make a straight angle just looking at the question I did not know the answer so I started thinking I said well I don't think it will be the first I don't I don't guess it would be the second but my mind was between supplementary angle and complementary angle and then I laughs I said to myself I said well Amanda has a a complicated life can never be straight but a man and I live a life of supplication can be straight so I cycle supplement supplementary and eternal that I pass and I pass the entrance I surprised myself oh praise the Lord and you know and on and on you know there's a way that that God these with us each and every one of us there are things that will speak to you they might never speak to me I might never speak to anybody you know people get out they look on nature and it just started crap it starts to cry remember yesterday we were talking with the brother Darren we went for breakfast and we were just talking something I can't remember the train of thought and I just said something you know I was just saying something or finding courage I mean I was just saying something like I will always do and I mean it just you know bruster out into a crying service and and and it's because of the way that God designed us in the message I've heard but now I see verbatim talks about a channel of communication every man that God made there's a way that God bill to communicate to you there's a channel of communication praise the Lord and and sometimes you know and that is the way it is with every one of us so you know sometimes I will see some things and I appreciate one of the brothers you know you coming up a little bit on what we were talking on Wednesday night I think I kind of misuse the word but it was because of what was on my mind that's a bird Brandon preached a message called statue of a peppermint it's actually stature of a person named but you know in the statute of a perfect man and I talked about this this morning looking and the book of Sam Sam chapter 19 David thought about were the statue of the Lord is right and you know when I when I read that to me a mind smokin re brain for me to better understand their I say the statute of the Lord is upright because when when Moses talked about the statues in the statues and the ordinances in in in Old Testament in the book of Exodus Leviticus he was talking about the statute of the Lord in all of the head Moses was talking about pretty much what brother Branham was talking about because the statue that was given to Israel was not really a monument because God has already told him not to build a graven image after no kind Deuteronomy chapter 4 go to Israel you know I never come to you in a form of a bird or in a form of a beast when I came to you it was my word that's God's greater form that he can come to everybody that's his word amen so the statue that was given to Israel was the Word of God but yet their word was given to Israel because God was going to bail he starts you in his people that's the reason why man India fitted India physical representation they will bail a statue of Abraham Lincoln or a statue of George Washington you know just like I was saying and put it in a garden but when God is building his statue he's building it in a living being amen it starts by faith in virtue and knowledge and temperance to bring us to bring us to the starts you of Epiphany now when you look over in the book of Genesis we will now say that Adam you know God built a statue of a perfect man in Eden but God give us a statue of a perfect man because there was a perfect man God and Adam was made in His image praise the Lord so one time I was also doing something like that and I don't know I you just have to pray for me like a - a brother yesterday I say it takes two people to make a good pastor amen it takes you to make a good pastor if you ever have a good pastor it would take it would take your ability to bear with me praise the Lord amen and one of the brothers in one of the meetings we were I guess maybe he was sleeping in you know and and the preacher said something in everybody you know was shouting and rejoice and his jam out of his sleeping you know and his wife accent What did he say say well I know he said something good because everybody's shouting praise the Lord yeah but I appreciate each and every one of you it's good to be in the house of the Lord and I see our sisters there from campus good to see you people sister Sarah praise the Lord and it's good to see you people praise the Lord Alleluia amen but Joseph want us to pray for him it's having a kind of fat infection in his hands and it's causing pain for him so we will remember him this morning and let's just stand to our feet a little bit so we can read the wording and hope not to keep you long this morning praise the Lord Amen and like I said thank you for bearing with me some time I say one thing and I'm going man waiting saying another thing another thing I wanted to say before we we just pray here is that uh I think last service was was it was a tremendous service this is what happened sometimes people instead Jesus said a Good Shepherd we leave the ninety-nine and he would go after one but here is the thing with the Sheep most of the time we don't want to be the 99 we want to be the one amen praise the Lord so if the Shepherd leave the ninety-nine I'm going after the one as long as you are not that one then you feel like oh what is he going after the one and not going after me praise the Lord he's going after that one because the one is you know it's part of us praise the Lord when the one come back to this fall is completed so if the if you know if if the service you notice is is going after young people and maybe you know you have grown in grace and you think the message is too little for you just be the 99 wait letter won't come back praise the Lord just be the night tonight and I think that was what happened in Sunday yesterday I mean last Sunday I mean it was a service I was going after one maybe I was that one maybe you was that one but what I would say also is the other you know we all have a story we all have the dealing of the Lord some people might choose not to speak about it some people story we only hear about it when we get on the other side amen but if God laid on the heart of a young man or a young woman to come and share with us what the grace of God has been doing in their life and we expect you and myself to stay there and appreciate what God has brought that person true but just is that my Jesus I love thee let's sing that now I love I know [Music] yes for me Oh [Music] Oh see I read my gracious my shots ready I say [Music] oh yeah I love my G oh my gracious my gracious yes my just ribbit my fear [Music] Hey [Music] ah [Music] my [Music] Allah bless you thank you musicians let's go to the Book of Isaiah Isaiah chapter 49 Isaiah chapter 49 verse 13 sing o heaven and be joyful all earth and break forth into singing all mountains for the Lord have comforted his people and will have mercy upon his of like a science here the Lord have forsaken me my Lord has forgotten me in a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of a womb yet they may forget yet I will never forget thee behold thou behold I have grieving thee upon the palm of my hand the walls the walls are continuously before me praise the Lord Allah bless you may have your seat let's go to sin John chapter 6 and have expert joining to do accountable audio reading for us this morning so we will just place in John chapter 6 it's a beautiful story there may be that's why we might have for the service this morning and then find a lot of time to preach but I want us to read through the chapter that's in John chapter 6 this for me for Jordan you ready you go right ahead chapter 6 after these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee which is the sea of Tiberias and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased and Jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples and the Passover a feast of the Jews was nigh when Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto Him he saith unto Philip when shall we buy bread but these may eat and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do Philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them and every one of them may take a little one of his disciples Andrew simon Peters brother saith unto Him there is a lad here which had five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many and jesus said take the men and sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand and Jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten then those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that profit that should come into the world when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward Capernaum and it was now dark and Jesus was not come to them and the sea arose by reason of a great wind to the flew so when they had wrote about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see Jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid but he saith unto them it is I be not afraid then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat their saved that one wherein to his disciples were entered and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they didn't eat bread after that the Lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to Capernaum seeking for Jesus and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you ye seek me not because he saw the miracles but because he did eat of the loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed then said they unto Him what shall we do that we might work the works of God jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that ye believe on Him whom he had sent they said therefore unto Him what sign show us now them that we may see and believe thee what does thou work our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven 3 then jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto Him Lord evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out where I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone would see at the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day the Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this Jesus the Son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith I came down from heaven Jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and had learned of the Father cometh unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of God he hath seen the father verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life I am that Bread of Life your father's did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father had sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard thing who can hear it when Jesus knew and himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth this offend you why did if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said Jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the Son of the Living God jesus answered them have I not chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil he spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve a me praise the Lord then we can pray and go home this morning amen would that be enough oh you want us to preach should we preach a little bit okay thank you for bearing with us Amy you look at verse 66 verse 66 now realized that this is in John chapter 6 verse 60 system from that time many of the disciples went back and walked with him no more now you would just think you would think in your mind you know how how can this work how did it work out that these people that walk away from this truth and I mean and walk with him no more they were just recorded in the 6th chapter and the 66th verse praise the Lord sometimes I need to explain myself you see what I'm going with this is 6 6 6 they seen the truth the truth is standing right there before them and they walk away from it and yes John will recall that in his sixth chapter the 66 verse I never wrote the Bible it was long written before everyone of us Berta Branham never wrote the Bible amen but you see those are some other things you will read you know that that make us to believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God praise the Lord I was really I was listening to a young man testimony in yesterday and and I thought about of the same scenario of you you know the young man I grew up and I mean he started following his grandmother at honor the Jehovah Witness teaching and then he came to the place after many years and started seeing some you know some some errors in the teaching and conflicting the errors of the organization and making it the errors of the Bible praise the Lord why because he believed his organization was carrying him to heaven so if the organization is not having a problem then the Bible has a problem praise the Lord and then he's saying here in his testimony I'll get to what I want to say this morning but he's saying testifying year that you know I you know I started I started struggling with some things in you know and then how he read there from Timothy and how the women must be in subjection you're a but you know we have seen some great intelligent women why you know and he start bringing all these political words of misogyny and sexism and all of the earth and and I was saying thinking I was sitting there and thinking to myself why don't people see the power that God put in subjection praise the Lord and that's what religion would do religion would take one person one of God's creation to beat on another creation of God praise the Lord but the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ would never do that I said to myself I said this young man that is talking he you know his wife had a baby for him I wonder why he never thought why didn't I get pregnant and my wife was not the one that carry the child amen because if he will see to the place well wonder when the scripture asks that the woman must be in subjection and she must learn if he will see that to be an evil thing and he sees me right now I'm now serving God I don't believe in God I don't believe nothing to dad now that's what an intellectual faith will do it can carry you just as far as you can go but when their faith have not dropped from your mental conception to your soul if we carry you as far as they can go and it will hang you just like a hang Judas praise the Lord in Genesis chapter 3 when God told the woman you bring life into the earth praise the Lord and the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent God gave the woman he gave this woman the promise of redemption the issue of life was given to the woman praise the Lord we have to know that God he's the author of life amen he's the life giver he designed us amen but yet in the woman he has given this ability to be able to be conceived for try and carry the child in in all the changes that were happening before the child has its full body form the warmer will bear were barren and she will go through all of that now if that is not powerful if that is not powerful that God who gave to this woman that promise that vet you three Sacre vet she was not giving to a man go never give a man sacrifice you but three sacraments you was given to the woman and the prophet of God said it was because of redemption that God gave the woman that three soccer vets you is because God is trusting this woman with a commission of life she will be the life Giver and that is the reason why over and over in the scripture every time it comes to speaking about Redemption God will always when Abraham was losing strength he was losing strength and and he was anxious to have a child go to him I am your exceeding and great reward amen I am your exceeding and great reward come and lean on me go I was telling everyone I'm coming breasts straight from me God became L shudder he became a mother to Abraham praise the Lord right in the word we read this morning from Isaiah here is God speaking about Zion he's speaking about Jerusalem and he's saying there Jerusalem you think I have forgiven I have forgotten about B he said no just like a mother will not forget about her son that she has born I will never forget about being for a matter of fact I have engraving you in my palm praise the Lord Jesus he's to a man olive and he was so heartbroken of how the religious system has tucked the people far away from God into tradition he said Jerusalem Oh Jerusalem how I will have cover you now like a rooster the rooster don't have her I will have half of you like a hand I will bring you together that's a motherly love that's God taking the form of a mother whenever it comes to the Lord that he has for his people praise the Lord I just feel sorry for that young man I think it would have been a better he stand a better chance if you have said I don't understand this I don't understand what it's written like that you stand a better chance for God to bring understanding your way because the scripture says if any man secret wisdom let he acts of God and God would grant it to him whatever man would just look at that in and said sir I don't know why the Bible would says this and I don't want to have nothing to do with it there is nothing about this God now we're talking this morning on all the father has given me and where I want to go into this morning is intellectual faith versus divine right halation praise the Lord on Wednesday night we speak we spoke a little bit there on ask chapter 19 how I pullo's and those men that's to honor John teaching they were kicked I was looking at the timeline from the time John the Baptist preached and he was arrested and put into prison to the time of Acts chapter 19 that was about forty years or a little bit plus and you think about it after those people sat on that revival that just lasted six months I mean when John the Baptist came on the scene everybody knew something was happening in Jerusalem praise the Lord because they have heard the kind of for preaching that they have never heard before he was not afraid of anybody praise the Lord and he was calling the people to repentance he saw how they were dressing in the adage and he rebuked them for the address call he rebuked them for the correct for the corruption and ash that they all come to the water than beef and be baptized he had a ministry and it was to introduce the Messiah praise the Lord and when John's two on Jordan the update and said behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he have introduced the Messiah amen he came to the climax of his ministry even though he stood around a little bit too you know for the loose ends together and even there the imprisoned he sent some of his disciples and said go and ask is he the one all is dead is that another one we should be looking for Jesus said blessed is he that is not offended II mean well what what what what attracted me to this is that they keeping power that was aimed at six months half of a year revival that could keep those people the Bible speaks of them there in Acts chapter 19 that they were dedicated now you find people that you know they confess the Holy Ghost they confess the move of God the time God they confess the saving power the Mormon is still having an issue with scriptural things or maybe a problem with their system the first thing they do to tell that it no longer believe this thing this starts to go back to the scene filter came out of which mean all you here to was just in your mind and you have never been here I mean if your belief is has become a principle that have changed your life even if you don't like my preaching even if you don't believe this message it never changed the Holy Ghost from keeping you living a holy life why would a person said there is nothing to this message and any go right back to the word they go back into our door traitor go back into living wrong they go back into dressing wrong are we together that is the trouble of intellectual faith those men are chapter 19 they never had intellectual faith John spoke about the Messiah they never saw the Messiah but yet the world was in your heart Jesus came and their history and a half years ministry they never never follow the never went to the Torah my olive where Jesus was preaching I mean here - John what don't give them they were faithful they were dedicated they were looking for the Messiah they never had the opportunity to see him in flesh but because they were dedicated and truthful to the word that John gave them when Paul came alone it was not difficult they never saw Jesus in the flesh but they saw Jesus in the world praise the Lord amen and we see those things all through the scripture Paul said our mouths have forsaken me he talks about Alexander Smith and all of these people that was standing with Paul he went with him they saw him healing the sick they saw him doing that I mean with with all the churches that he works with they saw this man going into prison coming out of prison preaching the same gospel but when he got to the place that he could not understand why with such a man of a ministry of the caliber of Paul he will be complaining with her eyes problem I mean they could not put those things together how can he be praying for people and even his own alive it's not even better no no this thing of psychology there is something about this thing intellectual faith we only carry the pressing so long it can carry a person so long but it will not be able to deliver you on the other side praise the Lord amen and will now be able to deliver you on the other side and right over here in Saint John chapter 6 that's the reason why we had to read the entire chapter we saw a year there were Jesus and the amazing thing here is there I'm John in writing in writing his testimony or his record of Jesus he brought Jesus right into the feast if you read from sin John chapter 2 sin John chapter 1 John did a lot of introduction in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the world wars if I Fletcher word took on flesh he came unto his own his own receiving neighbor and many John did there to introduce Jesus as the word amen but he brought it right into the feasts from sin John chapter 2 altars in John chapter 7 there was a time where Asia was celebrating oh there are seven feasts or this happy between that time are we together and right here in st. John chapter 6 it was the feasts of a living bread now you follow me now John is talking about Jesus here introducing Jesus and his approach was different from Matthew we spoke on the four Gospels before much you introduced Jesus as a king amen he introduced him as a king right there in the beginning of Matthew that's were it was a where is he that is born King of the Jews mark introduced him as a seven look deal with him as the son of man but John was a different kind okay man he was a different kind when he talks about Jesus he said he was the word from the beginning amen the word right from the beginning right from God's mind the one by whom all things were created are we together but yeah he brings Jesus right into the feasts for sure and and fulfill what Jesus said he said I am the lord of the Sabbath which means the Sabbath and all the feasts that was given to Israel in Thompson's shadow was speaking about Jesus that's why right here on the feast of unleavened bread he comes out and tell the people I am the bread from heaven they just come from the synagogue's and they are doing the unleavened bread celebration and this man is saying he's the brain why because they're that ordinance the Moses gift to them was speaking about this man it was speaking about Jesus and he's coming right there to identify himself with the feets he never went to celebrate the feasts just read recently on carefully Jesus never went into the feasts why because he was the fulfillment he waited for them to come from the feast and he's too out and saying you people coming from eating unleavened bread I am that Bread amen you following your tradition come and eat my flesh and drink my blood how can this man say this people who rather follow the laws the crease and the dogma of a tradition than to take the word in flesh this word want to embody your flesh praise the Lord this world want to be flesh in you this word is not satisfied of you reading every morning and every evening if it can live in you praise the Lord it's not satisfied the Bible is looking at you take me from the pages the word is saying I want to get from the pages I want to embody you I want to live in you I want to live through you just like Adam was a living monument this world want to be a living Bible in you praise the Lord see that's the thing that breaks God's heart we can cherish this Bible and we must cherish it and we we must respect it we can keep it on or put it to the best place in our house amen but if the word is not having three minutes in your life God is so heartbroken they want to keep me in a book when I want to live in them people want to keep me in a book and just put me on a shelf that's my Bible or Jesus thank you Oh God on these words to move out of these pages leaving you he never went to the office amen the scripture says right after he fed the monster - you and all of that he got on the boat he went on the other side how are we to get him when he fed the people with the loaves of bread a little bit ago you know where does the the scripture was playing this morning we were listening to and I was there the Bible says right there in st. John chapter 6 there were five tiles in men I remember a preacher that said to mean he said brother won't read that strict read again I read it was 5000 men and then I went on he says you realize that we have said over in almost a jesus prayer five times in the scripture only counts are the men not the women and the children amen and then when we get down to counting the children we have to look for boys and girls so God just sealed it up praise the Lord Amy let's go ahead so the scripture says after Jesus fed him this is wow this is he that the scriptures spoke about now realize now read now the Bible says and Jesus slipped away from them because they were thinking to make him their king the Jews wanted to be free from the Romans amen if this man can feed 5000 with a loaf of bread and the fish my goodness we can start our own government he can be our King we can be quite away from the Romans he would feed everybody they were looking to a physical and material manifestation I mean they were looking for what he can do for them what he can do for them and that's what people call religion that's what they call church it's what what they can do for me what the church can do for me praise the Lord that's what Jesus came they came on the other side to meet him and says oh my sir we've been looking for you Jesus are you not really coming after me because you you want the word you are now after the teachings you are not after being change you are not after ignoring the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob you are just after your belly what can feel you are walking walking aside to you for the time praise the Lord you know after the changing power how would you get it so when Jesus went on and started to tell them your father ate manna in the wilderness well I am the true bread that came from heaven now these very people that were thinking to make him King there's every people that said just yesterday when he fed him that this is he that the prophets are spoken about when he identified himself with the scripture the I am the true bread that comes from heaven is this not Joseph's son it's not the boy that fits my table the last time the one that Joseph sent to hang my door praise the Lord just yesterday they were saying this is he that the scripture or the Prophet spoke about so what does prophet spoke about how did they conceive it it was just mentor say today I mean that we apply it to so some things that please them and when it didn't matter pleased him when it did not pleased it they were not apply it to it are we together but you see the trouble year is there we all receive the word true mental faith that's the trouble it is when a word is preached we receive the word through our mentor faith and then it leaves from you and then becomes divine revelation in the heart amen now that word becomes divine revelation in the heart when the individual believe that that is God's Word it's there in a mental ring when the person starts to think how can that be really sign says this and the Bible says this how can that be and it's that's the reason about reasoning about the word in your mind that would just be a mint of faith oh okay I see okay yeah okay okay I see because because because it's just a mint of faith no matter how you can explain it the Word of God is true because God said so amen the Word of God is true because God said so because you believe that there is a living God let's read this up a second coming he says as a man thinketh in his heart the scientists said that God got everything mixed up there was no mental faculty in a heart to think with he just think with his mind his mind was the only thing he thinks and net with his heart with the mind but God said as a man thinketh in his heart praise the Lord Amen now you see science always want to come and disprove what God says using God's creation let them make their own amen let them make their own this man that God has seen as a man thinking in his heart God made a man God knew that there was a compartment in a man's heart the blood does not runs true a few week ago medical science found that in the center of the heart it's a tiny little place that don't have blood cells or anything around it and the claim is the occupation of the sole animal doesn't have it so after all God was right when a man thinketh in his heart are we together and we realize people most especially living in such an age and information age praise the Lord where we have truth information and false information but you see people believe in all of the things that is out there and don't know nothing about the God that put it out there and that is the thing that is killing that is killing many people after going 10 years 20 years 30 years 40 years calling to a belief system and it has never if you're whatever you believe cannot be able to make God real to you praise the Lord if you are just believing it for the rules you are setting yourself a time bomb praise the Lord I mean because when you're fit drops down in your heart it brings a birth amen and that birth will bring a life that is not your life is God's life amen the new birth brings God's life many times we want to think that a new birth is our life because I stopped smoking no because I saw God taking cigarette from me in my life that's what the new the new birth is is the life of God it's making career to you because you can see your weakness and your failure yet you can see God working on the inside you can see God helping you that's what the new birth is it's not your personal possession it's not your personal possession for you to be boastful about it I was born again my life change I'm not like you it's not your personal possession you have never seen what our birthdays because with the new birth you will see your old man lying on the body on the bed and you will see the brand-new man praise the Lord that's what a divine favor would do that's what a divine revelation will do it will bring a breath in your life that's why every day you will go by and your time go for grace praise the Lord that's the reason why when the man is born again or the woman is born again and they can see this birth they cherish it amen they cherish it they know that it's precious because I can see what I am I can really see how awful I am but I thank God for this precious gift that he have given me I thank God for this precious gift when I start to get angry and start grinding my teeth no angle you want to destroy this baby that's when the word becomes a divine revelation because what a revelation does is that a reveille to you a reveal it gives you a vision of this new life and what is doing how it's helping you what many people takes the new birth in an intellectual way I went to the revive where I said Jesus Christ I said it's in a prayer and they can go one week with a good feeling and the next week they don't know what is happening why because that experience is just it's just mentally you want to understand Jesus say you can you feel where the wind come from you feel a blowing you don't know where it's coming from you don't know where it's going you can understand it sometimes gonna put your life on the wheels and he's trying to deal with certain thing in your life are you trying to impart setting grace to you and you get on the wheels and things are happening I can understand it oh-ho but I believe there's a new life Gary I know it's because of this new birth this thing is happening to me I can understand it but I believe it and because I know it is God's life and Noah story to come out good it's going to come out good because everything he made in the beginning was good the scriptures say it was good and he made this it was good he made it was good until it became very good but intellectual faith it's killing people we want to understand everything we want to have our life so line as before we know what is going to happen from now what is the time it's almost 1:00 o'clock I don't even know what's going to happen before the time reached one o'clock you know we get we get we we are actually at this place where our life is so scheduled until we want to put God on that schedule 7:00 a.m. this is what we're supposed to do we have in our our exercise to do our medication to take our breakfast the kind of a food that we must eat in between this time - that's the everything is so schedule it's not a bad thing I mean it's not a bad thing if your life that way is to help you it's not a bad thing but where it becomes dangerous it's worth we want to apply that to what God is doing we want to process all of that through our mind amen I give my life to God now yeah okay I received the holy God and this is going to happen and this is going to happen in this is going to happen he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he is the rewarder of those that diligently seek Him are we together containing for the faith there's quite a difference you mean having intellectual faith than a divine faith there's where you are my Baptist friends fail to go on because intellectual fail would just put you to the place make you to believe that you have it everything is okay praise the Lord but understand this understand these principle people right from the beginning when God started working he never rested every other day god there's something new he never rested until he got a man in His image if God did that to the earth is the same thing he's going to do to you every day you will have your daily challenge God is working on you he's not going to rest until he gets you in His image you get intellectual faith by that but it must be a divine revelation to you that just came out of my heart intellectual faith is not enough you can know the books of the Bible you can know the verses in the Bible you can know the course of the message it's not enough you must be able to identify what God is doing in your life he wanted people that's one of his three for purpose that he can have the preeminence in the people that was saying that my will but let your will be done I don't understand it but I believe law you are in control praise the Lord I don't understand it but I believe you are in control I mean do we understand how we sleep this whole thing about sleep have you ever thought about it what real asleep is I know I put something into your mind I don't know myself I just need and pray commit myself to God go to bed praise the Lord but the thing about it they're the reason why I say this is that you want a bed last night you woke up this morning you believe that you are here you believe that you are here if you and I yeah we will not see you in service this morning are you here are you here do you believe that you are here amen oh this whole thing is a dream to you do you believe you are here you are here I believe I'm here I believe you are here and we together just as a person you know are you born again then the first thing instead of yes or no or by the grace of God thank God for what God is doing my life the first thing we go to is to explain what a new birth is that's not it's mental faith well okay when you say born again what do you really mean do you mean the new birth or when did I accept the Lord Jesus Christ or sense when I've been going to church all of those things then we get into doctrine we want to explain it let me really explain what I mean to you Oh Lord Jesus do we work in a salon do a work in us instead of appreciating what we know let us as preciate what you are doing what we are feeling in us what is happening in us because you can explain what is happening there you can explain the flame that is that is burning in you they almost want to burst out you can't you can't explain it you just feel a joy inside of you just feel the goodness of the Lord when you realize that God has been so good to you you feel so good in you it's almost like you want to explore but you don't even know where the explosion would come out of sometimes we are afraid I don't know whatever can water out of my mouth out of my head I don't even know so we try to continue in intellectual faith it's killing people it's killing good people seeking to understand and understand and understand no matter how much you know you will always need to know no matter how much you know you will always need to know praise the Lord amen you always need to know you can be in the building you know every crack and corner of that building when you get to a door that is luck you always want to know what is happening behind it so no matter how much you know you will always need to know because there was situation I will come up and you will want to but when their divine revelation is settled down in your heart you know that God is and he's in control praise the Lord he's in control it just makes you to trust and just love and just believe it's really little bitty and in the end we'll find a place to close on this the Holy Spirit is a personal experience of the birth the new birth regeneration making a new creature in Christ unveiling of God he says you can explain faith it's something that you believe and it's so solid that there is nothing else can take its place it's when it has dropped down here amen you can feel it you know is there you might be trouble in the spirit worried but you can fit it in your heart and it brings you to the place to know that it's going to be okay because God is in control Second Coming you you can have intellectual fit by year in the world and perceiving it in your mind and accepting it upon those basis which is intellectual faith you hear the word yeah that makes right yeah that sounds good perceive it in your mind you pause for a while oh okay I see where he's going okay yeah yeah yeah he's preaching the message receive that in your mind and upon the basis of that you believe okay yeah that's true because it makes sense and that would just be intellectual faith welfare is that there Jesus was speaking up in Saint John 5:24 he died hearing my word and believed on him that sent me hath everlasting life that doesn't comes from intellectual faith there comes from a born-again experience as a man thinketh in his heart he's born again and from that comes forth I thought his soul not from his mind but from his soul something that tells him that it is wrong and country and encontrar is wrong amen I hope you get it you know it anyhow oh now what the doctor says what the doctor says what the Evangelist says you know every time in your soul you can bring it right back home amen no matter what the doctor said about your be of your medical condition you can bring it right back home you know right down in your soul that's a God I have that separated me from my mother womb and kept me all this time it is just like they're flying the spirits I spoke about this morning the higher you go the smaller life situation becomes to you when your problems are becoming so big and so visible to you you are losing attitude I mean when they are becoming so visible and the beginning to trouble you you can identify you can see what is happening here you can see what is happening here you can see everything around you are losing attitude praise the Lord then you beginning to dissent you better step on that gas and take it up again brother you better find another route of faith and just get up into the heavens world those things will start disappearing from your eyes amen life situation you will just see them they're just looking like a you can't really identify it is there but it's look is so small because you are so much in his presence praise the Lord and that was the difference between the LA Ephesian Church those people got a divine revelation your revelation and a true revelation will keep you I mean even when there is no church when there is no preacher it's a life inside where Bram says is what the dog eats and make the outside of the body clean it's what it keeps inside when we start struggling with things in our mine and giving our said reason why we should do things what's the special when it's contrary to the Word of God then you just been following the Lord all of these years just by a mentor faith your experience with God must affect your life when the Pharisees I mean those wise men came and asked for Jesus that's for the king we have seen his time and we have come to worship Him harro called them those tribe they could sit right there and turn into the book and said go to the Book of Micah chapter 5 that's what it's written is supposed to be in bed to him that's what our prophet said out of Judah will come it's time they knew what the scripture says but Jesus walking right into their presence never affected them a look at a woman at a will look at me remodeling that came falling down at his feet they knew her life they could see whatever but she said right knee right there wept use her hair clean his feet and Jesus said go and sin no more what a word what a word to hear from the Masters mouth it was not a commandment he was pronouncing and declaring on her life now a woman caught in adultery praise the Lord now I could see him here on to his feet say okay master see you you say you do you know Moses said this and but now you said what do you say about this praise the Lord amen glory be to God he says neither do i condemn thee go and see no more where Benham talks about representation he says the woman at the well had a representation in her amen she had a representation here's where the struggle was the mountain she was talking about in Samara was Mount Moriah that was where God met Abraham so she's saying this you said it's in Jerusalem that we should worship but this is where God met our father Abraham are you greater than him praise the Lord that's what she was taught but down in her heart there was a representation praise the Lord and when Jesus got down to telling her how fat you have six husband and the man that you live with is not your husband she said I perceive you know when when the word stat this guy's in you amen the word start taking all the disguise from on you all the place you are hiding man glory be to God she says sir I perceive now you are a prophet that's what the divine faith would do what are you reading your Bible or whether God is dealing with you in your own private closet or whether is under the preaching of the word you don't go hiding yourself it becomes a love affair you want to run out and embrace him you said Lord Here I am I need more of you I want to get closer to you I want to understand myself better praise the Lord I want to understand myself better deal with me bring me closer to you that's a divine faith that's a divine faith the scripture said Enoch walked with God and he was not that man had a revelation he never had hi in those days but whenever he gets out to walk he goes talking by himself and people think he's losing his mind he was walking with God there was something real to him when he goes talking Lord you know you know what I'm dealing with father I thank you for a good day today and he go just talking and sometimes he laughing by himself and people think oh wow this guy's strange he was walking with God that's how God want to be personal in our life amen he want to be visible to you pressing help in time of trouble I'm telling you intellectual faith that was what Judas had in his faith hang him and them as the cup was made Alexander all these people they had intellectual faith they when we pour all of these years since how can a man be like this owner one coat he has what a court has to do with what God is doing in a man's life why should people limit God's dealing with a man with material things when we are not saved by a corruptible seed we are saved by an incorruptible seed so God is doing an incorruptible life I mean work in our life and this whole age has limit God to corruptible things with a prosperity gospel and that's why these people were doing the owner wanted him for what he could gave to them what they could eat what they could drink but the reason why go on you because you have always been part of him all the father has given me welcome to me musicians you can come forth oh the father has given me welcome and I will not lose one now one I will lose Lord I believe in you passing their Lord I believe [Music] [Music] [Music] I be hey you I always believing I can't see you [Music] aha your presence of baby I put my frost lettuce farewell No Cantus is for where [Music] yes [Music] I always I can't see you lie pp MA your presents are fine I believe and I bless my [Music] lettuce say wow [Music] I can take this tour

sit in the mess of few people and you think that everybody is saying something and everybody that agreed with one another or that made sense I see why they all believe it when God you gotta stay with what God is doing in your life and how he's making himself real even if the popular opinion don't go for it you got hope you gotta keep it close [Music] even if as the Lord Watari [Music] and maybe you don't feel a world I you know you I don't want to follow this message and the more than I mean you people talk a lot about better better than even Jesus Christ and whatever it is but go back to your experience go back to those things they have to affect your life that I've taken habit away from you it was not a man it's not a work of a man one of the dangerous thing is when people just conform they see people doing things so they start doing it there is no life and then there is no birth in there but those things that God has given you by an experience those things that God has rough in your life don't let no man take it away don't let no situation take it away you have to believe this was God [Music] since we have seven the Living God our God is a living God the one that we serve he's the creator of heaven and earth we can limit God to forms increase a man's opinion [Music] we have to believe God for who he is [Music] sometimes we struggle to understand something [Music] you [Music] I was talking to a young person [Music] and what telling me no y-you know what this this up this this young brother says well I don't know the he asks the young sister what does she know
