confessed buried in the seas of forgetfulness the heaviest thing you'll carry is a lot of guilt and shame but you were never meant to bury it so let it go in jesus name our god is slow to anger and he's going to forgive our sin so let him put it under the blood [Music] that's as far away as the east is from the west what sin what's in that was gone the very minute you confessed it's buried in the sea [Music] of forgetfulness oh lord please deliver me for my accusing memory nothing makes me weep this way [Music] but when i hear you say [Music] what's in what's in that's as far away as the east is from the west what's in one that was gone the very minute you confessed it's buried in the sea [Music] unforgiveness [Applause] amen that's what it's all about saint what sin amen as soon as you confessed it faster than you could say it he was already forgiving you so he had already paid the price at calvary saints of god think about that he knew every every mistake every sin everything that you do before you were ever born think on that let's pause see law amen and yet he knew when we were unlovable when we were just sinners but yet he was still willing to pay the price because he esteemed you and you and you and you and you because we were created to have communion with him hallelujah hallelujah oh say just let that sink down deep this morning amen amen brother juan come on up here let's just sing that song there's coming a day hallelujah oh my key of g [Music] [Music] with no heart it shall come [Music] now [Music] what a day [Music] that will be [Music] the one who says

amen we want to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ it's good to see each and every one of you i know we couldn't wait to come you know i somebody scared singing and i came in it was a little bit emotional for me just to have everyone that came in so it's good to have each and every one of you even those that we're now able to make it and following the service online we greet you all in the name of the lord jesus praise the lord it's just so good to be back in the house of the lord amen not actually the building but with the people praise the lord so we are grateful for that and uh i will come behind brother scott again and say thank you to each and every one of you brothers that put tireless time into having all of this this weekend actually should have been our 25th anniversary meetings this local assembly is 25 years old so we were planning to have a special meeting this weekend to [Music] bring many of us that are new and young to the history of this church to kind of catch up with faith and also to rededicate ourselves after 25 years that the lord will be able to help us to serve him better than we did in the past year so we were actually setting this weekend up for the meeting on friday saturday and sunday so we spoke about that last week and i mean last year sorry and so i went to thinking i mean having 25 years anniversary what different can we do are we going to i didn't want us to rent at a hotel i wanted for the services to be here so we started thinking about it and i felt in my heart like i inherited this church with this building so i thought that well maybe i could do something special as as as an appreciation to the people so uh we came up with this project we spoke with brother jordan and a few of the other brothers says well maybe we can just change the carpet paint the building break down the office and uh but jordan said okay i'll work on it and he went together and he put a plane together and this was supposed to be at three weeks work it turned to be a four months work uh the man that we hired for the job good gentlemen good christian man we would not demonize them just the that for some reason they could not get the job done on time and it just couldn't do it right so you know i would leave from work every day and come and meet them here and i would tell them i said look you are robbing me i don't have an office i don't have a place to come in and you know and just have a private time when i get home i want to spend time with my family and so i'll come here all the time but it came to a place where we talked that it was necessary for us to just come get to on a good end and even end with them and then whatever that is left over with the help of the brothers we will be able to finish it ourselves so last sunday we worked all through the night i think we left from here last saturday maybe about 1am or so to be able to have last sunday service here which of course you and i year because we had ladders all year i mean the video did where not to show you this place you wouldn't have believed it you know ladders and wires all over the place i think you can see one standing out there in the hall you know i preached on the ladder last sunday but a farmer we have a ladder you're going to get on jacob's ladder this morning praise the lord so but that was the purpose of this and for no we will not regret it for one for one reason for no reason that's what i want to say and we are so thankful to be able to have a body to be able to have people that we can call our brothers and sisters and people that god has given to us to be able to grab the vision of what we are trying to do on this little corner and uh and we we've been so glad you know all of these years all the few years that we've been we've been working with this assembly so because we were not having an anniversary meeting because of the change of everything that was happening we just thought that i just thought i know uh you know i i fought with some of the brothers he says wow the place is not done let's just get it right i just i just felt in my heart it's not you know it's not the it's not the building you know what we want is the word of god in the midst of the people so so i called brother farmer i know we throw up meetings and meetings over and over cancer with him call him back cancel with him so i just called him the other week i said well we will not have the anniversary meeting but we will sure have you come and preach for us that we can be leaving there we will have got everything done and have a saturday night sunday morning service but we just we couldn't get it done and i'm telling you brother farmer was he was into the plow yesterday put him simmering on the wall and plastering and everything so we had a great time here and but here we are it feels so good to be with god's people if he's so good to be with brothers and sisters of light precious faith praise the lord we will greet our dear brother and his wife from pennsylvania but brad there's uh brother anderson sister christian dad but andrew's father-in-law uh they drove down and to visit with them and came to service with us god bless you we thank the lord for granting you a safe travel praise lord amen amen sister grace it's so easy to forget about you when you are here you know because you are home and sister grace and her boy is from tennessee visiting with her dad and mom bruce cat and his wife and uh and everyone that is following us online this morning so brother farmer will be preaching this morning whatever the lord placed on his heart as we normally do and this evening we will we will get back uh maybe an hour before the service stack i love to play the tape only believe [Music] 1961 was in that meeting that the holy spirit called brother brother farmer out as a little boy and and he'll tell you all about it tonight and the reason of that one is because we still have eyewitnesses of what we believe like i said last sunday after all period experience with the lord jesus he said we are not following conan devised people but we are eyewitnesses [Music] of his resurrection that was one of the reason and the second reason is that after being away out of these months i thank the the chief shepherd for keeping you amen because there's no way i could keep you praise the lord but i said that every time i say lord you are the chief shepherd you know where your people are you know their needs even though we are not gathering together but you are able to minister counsel pray for them i mean just just help them in whatever ways and if we just passed the microphone to testify this morning there are some testimonies that we just run and just fill this wrong but we want to give the time to the word of the lord amen so the second reason was to be able to create an atmosphere that will build faith we all know we are living in strange times there never been a time we have to come to church with max take our temperature the hand sanitizer and all of that and these are just strange times [Music] but these are the times where we need faith because jesus said when the son of the son of man come will he find faith and we can say yes lord if you come you will find faith you will find people contending for the faith that was once delivered to the sins [Music] so we will use this evening service to build faith and uh and he will preach to us and just as the holy spirit will lead him we will pray we will worship and we will just commit everything in the hands of the lord let's stand to our feet and let's sing amazing grace it was amazing grace where family you can come up [Music] god [Music] like me [Music] oh but now i'm [Music] amen thank god for his amazing grace there's a little song that we sing at home i don't know if y'all know it or not if not i'll try to teach it to you it says lord lord lord you've surely been good to me lord lord lord you've surely been good to me lord lord lord you've surely been good to me you have done what this world couldn't do it's a little bit of a happy song but church i believe we've got something this morning to be happy about then it goes on to say you healed my body when i was sick then another verse even says you saved my soul when i was lost and then there's another verse you know we can get healed and get sick again [Music] but when he fills you with the holy ghost and we are sealed into the kingdom there's no taking that away because we're sealed to the day of our redemption oh lord lord lord you've surely been good oh lord lord you've surely been good to me lord lord you've surely been good [Music] you healed my body when i was sick you've surely been good to me you saved my soul when i was lost you've surely been good you saved my soul [Music] now now if he hasn't filled you with the holy ghost i was talking to some of the brothers yesterday the most dangerous time to drive a vehicle is that twilight time when it's not really nighttime and it's not really daylight i don't care if it's in the morning just as it's breaking day or if it's in the evening when the nighttime's coming on the deer will come out because they feel comfortable being in those shatters right on the side of the road it's the most dangerous time and you let a christian that gives their life to the lord but they've not come under the seal of the holy ghost it's the most dangerous time of the world oh but to us that have entered in it's the most glorious time [Music] if you can't sing this from this last verse from the bottom of your heart i challenge you to not leave the building until you know that you've been filled with the holy ghost oh you killed me with the holy ghost you've surely been good to me you filled me with the holy ghost you surely thank [Music] me amen god bless y'all it's good to be back up here with you been several years but we uh i i've enjoyed my time already you'll be seated for just a minute if you want to i've enjoyed my time already with you over at brother carlin's yesterday was just sharing some testimonies seen the lord just do some wonderful things brother uh juan hernandez here with us he told brother scott he said if you don't give me a a seat on the front row i don't think i'm even coming but you know you get to talking about the lord and we've got a promise of this that when we start talking about him that he comes around amen and uh my i thought one time brother juan was just gonna jump up and run off on us you know he but the presence of the lord comes around and and you know i i live for that uh you know we've sent a meeting here uh uh i guess it's been about four years ago out in new mexico and and the presence of the lord was so real that there's a a minister a brother kenny capps sent a a message a a missionary and he goes all over the country and his wife was in the meeting and they had a little boy there at the time about seven or eight years old and just the presence of the lord swept through the building while brother wayne lawson was preaching he went skipping across the platform hollering i'm going in the rapture i'm going in the rapture and just wave after wave of the presence of the lord swept through and that sister thought she was leaving the ground right then and turned around to grab her little boy's hand because she didn't believe him i'm not content to live out of that presence i don't want it to just be a for a little time here and a little time there but oh i just i'm not content [Music] you take somebody that really gets hooked on drugs they're not happy unless they're doing drugs i want you to know i'm a junkie of jesus i'm hooked on jesus i'm an addict to jesus and it's my desire to stay in his presence [Music] god bless y'all brother juan thank you for having us up here and you know this may not be the official 25th anniversary meeting and i know he wanted to have different preachers come in and but you know really all we want is one preacher and that's the lord jesus christ and the lord willing we'll we'll talk to you on that in just a minute but if you want to stand with me again we'll we'll read a couple of scriptures and uh uh witnessing to a lady there in the the the motel this morning her name was mary and she'd ask that we would remember her husband and her son both of them needing a touch from the lord we how many believes that the lord is the best mechanic that there is i've seen it as a matter of fact a minister that was with y'all down there at manchester brother dale potter one time he had a transmission go out on him on a car while he was out on a preaching trip and they laid hands on the car and god healed the transmission and he drove it for another 50 000 miles amen one time i was going up north to visit my daddy and it started a snowstorm and i had a little old four cylinder uh plymouth champ it was back around 81 or 82 and it was an 80 model it didn't have that many miles on it but it started cutting out and i i got out and i popped the hood and i looked at it and i i thought well i don't see nothing wrong there's no fire jumping all over the place and we got back in the car started driving a little bit farther and just about two miles down the road it started cutting out again and i pulled over on the side of the road you know sometimes when you don't know what to do just follow instructions so i prayed and i got done praying and it was just laid on my heart to uh i asked my wife i said do you have an old burp diaper or something we had small children in the car with us and so she uh she said yeah i've got one and uh i said let me have it and i popped the hood and i wrapped that burp diaper around the distributor i've never heard anybody doing that but we got in the car and drove the rest of the way up to chicago and he never missed again he's the best mechanic that i know of yesterday in brother scott carlin's driveway uh sister carlin's brother joy come up a doctor fine man just really enjoyed talking to him oh he he got to uh witnessing to us a little bit about how that a cell in your body is made in such a way said i told him said you all need to build a big huge model to show people how that those things work and just enjoyed talking with him a little bit and uh he got in his car to go off and he just had it in the shop and they told him that the fuel pump was bad on it that when it got heated up that he couldn't restart it he walks out to the car the truck wouldn't start he didn't ask for a mechanic he asked for somebody to come out and lay hands on the truck we popped the hood and we looked at the engine i i couldn't tell anything was wrong but he didn't ask me to come out and look at the engine he asked us to come out and pray and you know a couple of brothers just laid hands on that truck one of them told him said go ahead and try it out he hit the starter switch and drove off that's my god if he's concerned about a a a 2010 model gmc pickup truck what do you think he thinks about a son and a daughter of his that's life of his own life flesh of his flesh blood of his blood amen let's just bow our heads before we read lord jesus we come to you lord so thankful that of what we've seen you do lord you you brought us to the word you give us eyes to see and ears to hear lord you've filled us with your spirit and sealed us in oh how i thank you for it lord and asking now as we're gathered with these people lord oh another milestone of so many 25 years lord of this assembly being here to to be a lighthouse and a witness to your loving grace lord how many years that brother juan has been here with him lord we appreciate those things all but most of all lord we appreciate you may you come down amongst us lord take me and use me for thy glory i pray in the name of jesus amen amen god bless you if you turn with me in john chapter 12. i'd like to read a couple of scriptures starting there at the the 20th verse down through the 24th john 12 and verse 20. and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast and the same came therefore to philip and said which was of beseda of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus philip cometh and telleth andrew and and again andrew and philip tell jesus and jesus answered them saying the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily i say unto you accept a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it shall abide alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit and then also in ephesians the fourth chapter very familiar scripture starting at verse nine now he that ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might feel all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ may the lord add his blessings to his word and you can feel free to be seated but if you later feel like just jumping up and praising the lord that's fine too against such we have no customs you know what a striking thing uh we uh we find that took place here and it had been just an odd day altogether that you know the lord jesus had had told a couple of the disciples said uh tell you what i want you to do you go over here to this village that's right over here by us and just as soon as you get into town you're gonna find a donkey tied up with a little old colt foal with her and no man's ever ridden on that cult but i want you to loose it and bring it and if anybody asks you anything about it just tell them the lord has a a need of this and they'll turn it loose to let you bring it so they went and they found that to be true they uh uh of course we can find in matthew and mark where it it goes through the whole story of it uh of how that they said uh hey ma'am what are you doing turning that cold loose and uh they said the master has need of it and of course the lord jesus got upon that cold and you know we're surrounded by a virus right now in case you hadn't heard and nobody knows what to do for it they don't have a vaccination for it but i know an inoculation amen they they give us advice to do things one way and then a month later tell us no that's the wrong thing to do don't do it and a month later tell us go back to doing what we told you to do in the first place they don't know what to do because they never rode this donkey before but i want you to know that the the creator of the donkey it didn't have to be broke by somebody to ride when he got on it he had dominion over it the same way that you and i have dominion over every circumstance that's apt to come up in our life we've been given dominion over all things are under our feet by the name of jesus christ amen oh it had been a strange day he rode into town and when he did they were pulling off their coats and throwing it down and and they were cutting limbs off of trees and and strewing them down in the way that that the lord jesus would come through and the donkey was walking on this carpet of clothes and limbs that they had thrown out there and they started hollering hosanna blessed be the king where we get the song that we sing hosanna blessed be the rock and you know the thing of it was they did not even understand they were being moved by the spirit oh i think it's important for us to get in the spirit the prophet of god told us that we ought to pray for revelation more than everything else but they was inspired to do it and they didn't even realize that they was living what zechariah 9 9 had had prophesied that it that would be done it was a strange time the lord jesus was coming into town and you know it wasn't the first time that he had went down to jerusalem the scripture tells us when he's just a 12 or 13 year old boy you all know the story that three days journey back mama and daddy starts looking for him and they can't find him and they thought that he was with them and how we see that typed out with the nominal church they just keep going on and they thought that god was with them they've not seen him in their midst they've they've not felt his presence for years and years but they thought that he was with them but i got news for you wherever you've left him is where you got to go back to so we see that when they could not find him but they had turned around and went back and no doubt as the lord jesus was going into jerusalem for this passover feast those things came back to mind and he might have remembered about how that when they came and said where have you been he said i've been about the father's business i said maybe joseph looked at him said son ain't no carpentry work to do down here he said oh but we're building a kingdom oh yeah i was about the father's business you might be the one that provides the meals that i eat but you're not my father because what was wrong in in mary was of the holy ghost it was another man a strange day and you know the scripture tells us when we if you was to read the entire chapter there in in uh john 12 of how that the lord jesus was fixing to go to a dinner before the the passover down at mary and martha and lazarus's house and there was a lot of people that was coming into town for this passover feast but they wasn't just coming to see jesus they also wanted to see lazarus because they had heard that there was a miracle that had taken place and they wanted to see him and the jews were so against the ministry of jesus christ that they wanted to kill lazarus because lazarus as brother one was saying this morning was a witness of the miracle that had been done they didn't only want to kill jesus they wanted to kill a witness so the same way that the enemy trying to tear down the message of the hour trying to tear down the ministry of jesus christ in this day is also desiring to tear you down because we are witnesses of what god has done hallelujah what i'd like to look at for just a few minutes is the fruits of the ministry of jesus christ so one of these greeks that that comes in they they they go up to the disciples and to philip and andrew and says sirs we we'd love to see jesus okay can you get us an appointment with him can you get us an interview with him so they talked it over amongst themselves and they go and tell jesus and jesus said boys it's time oh don't you just love it when god says it's time amen you might have been praying for healing for a long time you might have been praying to come back to church here for three months but wasn't you glad when somebody gave you a telephone call and said it's time amen it's time all things are ready oh we're longing to hear that once again aren't we amen but the lord jesus presents himself to these greeks which remember was a type of you and i he was surrounded by the jews but now he's turning to greeks and he doesn't walk out and say i'm the messiah that you've been longing to see he didn't say i'm jesus of nazareth but instead he started teaching them of the law of sowing and reaping now we're surrounded by farm country up here and i don't know of any of these farmers sister carlin that has ever went out and planted one bushel of corn that they was expecting this fall to get one bushel of corn out of this 140 acres how much you think you're going to get oh they might be expecting 120 bushels an acre but he ain't looking back for one bushel because if that corn of wheat goes into the ground and it dies it's going to bring back many times an odd way that when somebody says i want to see jesus he starts talking about a corn of wheat dying amen a lot of people came to the prophet of god and they said sir we want to see jesus the first thing he go to doing is preaching to him about divine healing and how to accept it they say but we want to see a miracle but first we had to be taught how to even accept it these greeks desire to see the lord jesus and the lord jesus started telling them about a crop that was fixing to come behind him a striking odd way that the lord jesus had of presenting that and we know that the prophet of god used this subject matter a number of times uh uh on why sirs we would see jesus the unveiling of god the masterpiece spiritual food in in due season boy i'd like to stop right there for a minute but maybe we'll do that tonight things that are to be let me back up here just second but the last four or five messages that brother branham preached before he went off the scene three times he brings up these scriptures in things that are to be on the rapture and on leadership the only one that i know of of the last sermons that brother branham preached that he did not mention these scriptures was communion and when you've got communion you've got john 12. amen sounds like he right there at the end he was really trying to get us to see something doesn't it you know when when the lord jesus was speaking there was times that he was driving a point down and we read it in our scriptures and it he'd say verily verily and of course the the scholars had looked into that and they told us and and the prophet of god made mention of it that it it the meaning of that was truly truly i say unto you it's putting emphasis on it but here we find at the very end of the prophet of god's ministry of how he put emphasis on three different times just right in a row that he mentions these things now the ministry the fruits of the ministry of jesus christ now the world has a pattern and in that pattern you notice you you take a preacher that it seems like that the lord does a little something in his life and all of a sudden they want so and so ministry pardon me for calling a couple names but they don't mind publicizing what uh kenneth copeland ministries billy graham ministries all these other uh uh jimmy swaggart ministries order order my books from jsm and i wonder if we haven't even let that trickle down into the message just a little bit let me tell you something it better not be about the man you lift up a man and that man will fall the prophet of god said don't put him on a pedestal we don't look to paul for our salvation we don't put paul on a pedestal we don't even put the prophet of god on a pedestal but the message that he brought was the word of god it was not it was not william branham ministry it was the ministry of jesus christ god's not willing to share his glory with anyone it's not brother one's ministry that has brought this church to the worship that you have it's the ministry of jesus christ that brings us to worship amen amen we don't follow that world pattern you know we read in the scriptures and even when it looks like that it's calling a certain man's ministry the prophet of god he uh many many many times and looking at the word zoe the life of god now some people would say oh brother force that only means life if a prophet tells me that a word means the life of god it's the life of god amen if he tells me that logos was the word of god whether it was written or that the written word is just a thought that's expressed i believe that logos was logos when it was still in the mind of god if it had never been written yet but god said let there be didn't have a voice to speak it through but the thought of god that was in his mind it was then that it was still logos when he saw you and i before there was a foundation to the world oh my we was talking about this on brother scott's back porch here uh yesterday just a little bit the the world does not have a foundation that's made out of concrete and steel beams but it's held into its orbit by the the contrast between the gravity of the sun and the speed that it's going around and ten other you know they used to say nine planets when i was in school but about like your brother said you know he was talking he said now when i went to to medical school they said this but now we know more about it you know when when we was in school i saw dinosaurs they said nine planets but you know they had better telescopes now i guess so they they found that there's another one but all of these things even though we didn't know there was a tenth one there it was helping hold this earth in the orbit that it is then that's just the foundation of this world and then this earth is just one of ten planets that's in our solar system and they tell me that when we look up at night at the milky way that all that that looks like a white fog that in that band is all little teeny tiny stars and we can't even count how many that there is but then they estimate that there are as many more uni in the universe as much as we can see in the whole milky way there's that many more milky ways out there and then we try and put god in a little bitty box somewhere that if god don't do something the way that we think it fits in in our little theological box that god can't do it that way you ain't gonna put god in that box he's the one that made all of it he's the one that made you and i the ministry of jesus christ now in the dialogue that brother branham would look at him and see these words from how it came in the new testament directly from the greek i i don't know the greek i can't pronounce it amen but the word that they use for ministry when it was when paul was speaking to timothy and telling him take make full proof of thy ministry it wasn't so that timothy could say this is my ministry see timothy was saying the same thing that paul said so because paul was preaching the ministry of jesus christ timothy was also preaching the ministry of jesus christ amen spirit led unorganized but just however the lord led to do it he'll lead an apostle to preach one way he'll have a teacher to do another he'll have an evangelist to do another he's got a pastor doing another but it's all by one spirit and it's all the ministry of jesus christ to his congregation brother david at home doesn't have a congregation the lord jesus has a congregation and my pastor is over that little group amen you know then that way if somebody gets up and they decide that they've got to leave it it don't it keeps us from getting hard feelings because it wasn't our people anyway it's god's people amen and when people come in we just glorify god because this is more of the body of god's people we're we're not a divided people hello we've got the world cosmos out here rioting because it's this against that against that against that and some of them say they're with this and actually what they're doing is fighting against all of them but that's not so with us because we that are in christ we are one we are one what makes a librarian sit down with an american with a guy in and with a disc and we're the colombian that we can all join together and praise the same lord jesus and rejoice over the same quotes amen what is it that does it it's christ in you the hope of glory fellowship and with christ in you the hope of glory with christ in you the hope of glory and it's christ fellowshipping with christ because we're all in him amen amen this word ministry was service boy that lets the wind out of my sails doesn't it forest farmer don't have a ministry imagine that brother one invited somebody up to preach to y'all that he don't even have a ministry he plays steel guitar somebody says oh brother farmer that that's a ministry of music well if you're going to call it a service because i'm not there for anybody to see me when i'm playing music just like all these folks that's playing music here this morning they're not up so that uh oh man listen to this rep nope the only thing they're there to do is to help set the atmosphere where that the ministry of jesus christ is welcome to come down amongst us so they are also partakers of the ministry of jesus christ and just welcoming that spirit down that we can rejoice in him that saved us and sealed us into him it's not an individual ministry that's why that we can have four or five ministers come together and it's just like one is building a platform for the next night and then for the next night and then for the next night and then and it's not a competition god don't fight with himself no but you've got different vessels but they're just pouring out that same oil it came from the same spout you take on those seven golden candle sticks i i'm sorry i'm getting sidetracked because i can preach right here for about three or four hours on those seven golden candlesticks on the original it had a word that was down that center stem now you remember the all seven of them drew out of one bowl of oil it was the same oil that was feeding paul's day that is feeding our day to day that's the reason why that we're entitled to have an ax2 meeting right here this morning amen i was in a service one time down in old mexico and i i said something my interpreter didn't know how to uh how to translate it so i reworded it and i don't even speak good english no wonder i'm hard to interpret into spanish and so brother sandy beach was there next to me and i i reworded it and he just stood there he still didn't know how to say what i was saying in my old hillbilly english so i turned around and i said something else and his son baruch was sitting down here about where you're at sister and he just kindly bugged his eyes out like that and then just a few minutes later we were had an open pavilion uh uh open sides around it just a ten roof and and there was too many people there to to get them all under and there was some that was outside like back behind where you three brothers are back there and i would say something before brother sandy could even interpret their their rejoicing throwing their hands up and i thought well they're just getting caught up in the spirit of the thing but after service baruch comes up and he said brother force that is so neat now the only spanish i know is what you can find on a mexican food menu they taught me to say dyla bendiga and they kindly smile at me i know i'm not pronouncing it right but they know what i'm trying to say that's god bless you you know i i wanted to learn how to say thank you and god bless you i don't have a need for the rest of it but the brother said that when brother sandy didn't know how to interpret that i turned around to him and told him what to say in spanish in the same dialect that they used in that village and the brothers back there then for five minutes was hearing in spanish before brother sandy ever interpreted what i said that's what happened in the upper room in acts 2. [Applause] my son clifford was uh we got the witness into a pentecost uh a pastor there in our town and uh uh of course he was fussing at my son and he said clifford i ain't even sure that you've got the holy ghost i ain't never heard you speak in tongues clifford said my daddy's been in more than acts 2 meeting than you've ever been in amen they all heard it they was all turning around and saying to each other are all of these men galileans how is it that we're all here and whatever everyone i'm saying i thought you told me that guy couldn't speak any galilean but that's the way we heard it that's my god amen why is it that sometimes that we can be sitting in a service and the lord go to speaking to us directly and we get outside and you walk up to somebody and you say oh brother did you hear what brother juan said in there he said well what was he saying well he said such and such such and such and that's exactly what i just went through today and i really needed that you say i never heard him say that and so you go down you go tell brother jordan i want a copy of the tape if brother once said that i must have fell asleep or something and you go back and you listen to it and you come out you say brother brother juan didn't say that oh yes he did he just preached on it yeah i heard that he just preached on that you go back and okay here's this there's this but he don't say that but we hear it in our own language sometimes what the spirit is saying it never was said vocalized but the spirit of god the ministry of jesus christ drops down something that was just meant for you what meant for everybody but you heard it oh the glory of god amen if a corn of wheat abides alone again you pardon me for calling a couple of names but you hear him on the news all the time if bill and melinda gates the biggest charitable foundation in the world if they never die out to self all they will ever amount to is bill and melinda gates when brother branham was preaching the seven church ages in 1954 he said a grain of corn if it abides it abides alone it'll never mean no more than one grain of corn it'll never amount to one more than one grain of corn you and i if we do not totally die out to self that christ can reign through us and take us and use us i will never amount to one more thing than just the son of glenn and gwendolyn farmer that's all i'll ever be one day there'll be a chunk of granite with my name carved in it and that's it but when we can die out that christ can live through us that the book of acts is a continuation because you and i are living it out though we may come to church we may pay tithes we may put into the offering i want you to know it was a blessing to me yesterday to come in and see just the brothers all coming together you'd have thought we was fixing to have church here yesterday afternoon would you man everybody come up shaking hands i'm glad the colvin police wasn't around they'd said y'all ain't got mask on you ain't sanitizing your hands but we were shaking one another's hand and everybody coming in put an arm around the other one y'all ain't immediate family oh yes we are same daddy [Music] hey man [Music] amen we we all got the same name this is jesus christ hallelujah [Applause] we can donate our our time to the church but if you don't die out to self it'll never amount to nothing but just one person oh but you take somebody that will find an altar i don't care if it's in the front of the church or if it's in your chair or if it's in the woods or if it's in the woodshed the prophet of god said that he didn't even know how to pray when he tried to give his heart to the lord so you know what he did he got a pen and and wrote down a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z and he said i know the lord how it knows how to put it together so you'll know what i'm saying and he died out he died out you know in my flesh the older that i get the more of glenn farmer i see in this flesh you know what i'm saying sometimes i have to watch what i eat because my daddy had to watch what he ate are you hearing me i still love to hunting fish don't y'all get mad at me i still love guns my daddy loved guns my daddy loved to hunting fish are you hearing me but this flesh is unconvertible but there's something down on the inside that it pulls this flesh into subjection to the word of god because it got changed and it's no longer the life of glenn and gwendolyn farmer but it's the life of the lord jesus christ brother branham said his mama was half cherokee indian and he said i still love the outdoors he said there's something that even my conversion didn't take away from me you may have something because we're part of god's flower garden of variety some of us are marigolds some of some of y'all some of us is dandelions but sometimes people don't even want us around but you know what in the spring of the year they sure are pretty yellow out there when nothing else is blooming yet amen and then you got some that they are just genuine roses i've got a rose bush there i i i enjoy messing with them things a little bit i i hope you don't think i'm too awful sissified just because i uh love flowers but i i do know this there's a quote and i'll find it for you if you want me to where the prophet of god said that we could learn more about god looking at a bouquet of flowers for one minute than what you could learn in a seminary for years amen i've got a rose at home that's called a mr lincoln i i don't go out and buy my wife a lot of flowers i grow yeah i i'll go out when when the crocus are blooming when the iris says i i i'll keep her base full right there over the sink you know where i've got one that's called a mr lincoln it's a dark red rose and it is the most fragrant rose i think in the world you cut that rascal off i can take it in the house and sherry can be back in the bedroom she'll say you brought in mr lincoln didn't i'm talking about in five you know what i'm saying and i believe that god's got some people but you can't even get in the same room with them until you know that you've been in the presence of a son or a daughter of god amen oh lord let us magnify the creator that has made us amen we can do all these things for the church we can support it we can take brother one out to eat every sunday but if we don't die out all you'll ever be is a meal ticket for brother one and the guy that's always there to work on the church well i thank god for but the kingdom of god is more desiring than just somebody that works and somebody that pays their tithes and somebody that gives in the offering somebody that's willing to play the music it's life [Music] every every vision every dream every nudge have you ever had one of those times that you really felt like that you you ought to do something and and you know isn't it amazing how busy that we get sometimes we get so busy that we can't even let the lord have his way in our life the way. do you all know what i'm talking about i'm a married man are you hearing me i'm a married man you say brother farmer you ain't got a ring that's cause i lost it this week i lost some weight and i'd i'd drive down the road and i'd play with that ring i knew it was loose and i thought you know what i've got a smaller ring at home that i used to wear when i was a younger man you know ain't that crazy you're small then you get bigger and then when you get older you start getting smaller again i don't understand i don't understand how a how black and white cow can eat green grass and give white milk either but yeah that's just the way lord does things and that ring went to get a and and i thought you know what i really need to pull that off and put it in the ashtray and and and go back and and get that other ring trade out for but but i don't want to take off my wedding ring now i can't find it but i was already nudged to do you know i've got to worry that sometimes when the lord just lays something on your heart and and you you just drop what you're doing and go do it i call them gold star days you know hang that one on the calendar man lick that baby and stick it to it i need a reminder of this one and you know it happens to us all the time each and every one of us god gives every one of us a gift in our life they let me play guitar at home just so i won't sing i can even write a song and somebody else will offer to sing it okay but no matter what it is god has given you something. god has given you something and when god gives it to you for the body that is as much a part of the ministry of jesus christ amen as the prophet of god was amen you may not touch as many but gods give you something i sat and told the brothers here just the other night i've seen the lord do more in my life around a dinner table than what i've seen in big meetings amen there's a brother out in murphy idaho this morning that i was in a meeting up in genoa illinois three years ago and uh i was sitting talking to a couple brothers and my attention got pulled to brother carlos back over here somebody just called brother carlos name here to to me yesterday or the day before the this is the one that he had a great testimony brother scott where you at was that you yes here you go he was going through a time of depression and i was sitting there talking to some people and my attention got pulled back over my shoulder and i turned around and i i said brother come here and and he didn't hear me or he didn't think i was talking to him i said brother come here so somebody grabs him and says hey bro brother farmer's hollering at you and so he says you want me i i said yesterday i i said come over here i said i just felt led to to say this and and i thought maybe you'd like to hear it and i went through how the lord had delivered somebody everybody else got up in a few minutes and left the table brother carla stayed there he said why did you call me over here i said because i felt led to he said i've been fighting a suicidal spirit for over a year i said brother do you believe that god delivered you of it he said yes i do i said the prophet of god said if something comes to you strangely or mysteriously check it out by the word and consult your pastor i said he's right over there why don't you go talk to him and bear witness of it the man stood up the next morning and was given testimony that the lord jesus had delivered him it wasn't because of something that i preached in that meeting i wasn't even one of the preachers i was just there to support the meeting but my attention was called back to brother carlos because brother carlos had a need and the lord jesus finally got forced in condition that he was listening to jesus and even after hollered at him two or three times oh god help us to be persistent in the ministry of jesus christ we don't give up just the first time that something comes about if we did we would not be gathered here this morning [Music] the contractors may have dropped the ball the brother stepped in and picked up the ball and run with it the prophet of god said it like this if johnny won't bring in the wood you bring in the wood brother jordan he come in you'd have thought that he was ramrod in a big construction job all the brothers go up to him what can i do what do you need me to do we do our i i believe the the scripture says it according to our several abilities don't ask me where it is but i i believe that's the way that it's worth it so everybody was just doing whatever they could you may think what i'm saying is a little bit strange you know there's a few quotes there's a few things that that brother branham said that that is so unusual that it's just been striking to me all my life it'd be okay if i share one of them with you one time there was a brother was talking to brother branham that he wanted him to come by his house i believe he lived up at sellersburg indiana and brother branham said uh do you live in a white clobbered house got a picket fence around it and he said yeah he said brother brandon have you ever been there you said yeah i was there just a few minutes ago he said i didn't see you said i was there in a vision there was another one that brother branham in a prayer line called out a man and he said in your bedroom he said you've got baseboards that's made out of tongue and groove flooring now you almost have to be a carpenter to to know what i'm talking about there but what it is it's flooring that that has a lip on it and then a groove on the other side where it snaps kindly together like that and the prophet of god told him it was painted red and told him what kind of wood that it was painted with are you hearing me yes but now there's another story that brother branham tells and that was that there was a lady that was sitting down in the church a a hat or a seat there and she seen a a a mama with a sick baby that was bringing them in and she had a prayer card in her hand and the compassion of that mother sitting back there uh looked at this mama holding a baby and she said sister said here why don't you sit here in my seat and i'll go find another one and she said well you don't have to do it and she said no i i just want to do that for you and she said well thank you thank you so much and she said what he heard said i see you've got a prayer card but would it be okay if i prayed for your baby and she said well certainly honey that that would be wonderful and the little mama just reaches over and prays i we don't even have any word that she was carrying a bottle of oil in her purse to anoint that baby we don't but she prayed for the baby and she goes and gets a seat she can't even get one on the main floor now she has to go way up in the balcony but that night in the prayer line the man of god was discerning the case of the prayer card that that mama had and she said he said there's a woman sitting way up in the balcony that she gave you her seat and asked if she could pray for your baby and she prayed the prayer of faith for it your baby's already healed go your way giving god the glory that lady up in the balcony was as much a part of the ministry of jesus christ as the prophet was telling them that that's where the healing took place amen amen amen we exercise faith amen faith was accounted to abraham for righteousness the lord just leads one of us to do something and you do it and you see what's taking place brother juan will tell you i really don't eat that much in the motel this morning i went down and got a cup of coffee and they had a little old bag there had a a apple in it and a a granola bar and uh i had a little old cherry cheesecake roll that they had cut up and wrapped up in saran wrap and and a bottle of water and i got one of them and i started to take something to the truck and i thought well i'll fill up my coffee and there was a little lady sitting in the the room there where they had these little bag deals i already got my breakfast are you hearing me and all of a sudden i wanted another one of them rolls but i already got mine pride tells me you ain't you ain't going up and asking for another bag but i got drugged i walked by i filled up my coffee i just i walked back i said ma'am do you have another one of them back she said are you going to church i said yes ma'am i am i said matter of fact i'm preaching this morning would you tell your congregate i said well sis i'm not the pastor i said but yes i will i told her i said she said well it said you don't even have to tell the whole congregation i said no i'm going to tell the whole congregation i said see if you see a mama with a little baby crying you can have more compassion for that mama with that crying baby than what i can us daddies get woke up at night but it's mama that rocking the baby all that long hello no matter what the lord then it was from that you know what i ate the little old roll and the rest of it is in the bag if the lord has to use me all of a sudden getting a taste for something to pull me into his will to do what he wants done now if i had my wife and a grandbaby in that room with me they don't charge anymore for the room and they gladly give me three bags but you know my pride i i i'm going back and asking for another bag today i'd rather go down to mcdonald's buy a sausage but maybe there wasn't somebody in a in mcdonald's waiting on the counter that needed prayer hello every move that we make the sons of god are led by the spirit of god amen oh all you black brothers and sisters in here you got one over on me right now because there's another little story about a prophet one time that was flying on an airplane and it took a storm to ground that plane in memphis tennessee but he had a letter that he needed to send out so he had plenty of time to go down to the post office so he heads down that way and as he's headed back for the plane something says go this way so he goes that way and he's thinking boy it's about time for that plane to take off but he said keep walking so he goes on walking and he gets on down he said in one place he said lord i i asked the lord why would you bring me down to this district down here by the the river just keep walking pretty soon there's mama out there leaning over the fence morning parson how did you know i was a parson parson you ever heard about that shooting that woman he probably preached on her a dozen times he said yes ma'am she said well i was a woman like that woman the lord gave me a son i tried to raise him right but he got out in the world picked up a disease said i got to pray and lord works my lives and elijah of this day had to come to meet that woman it may have taken a storm like what we had in town here the other night to ground that plane but god can create the storm to cause a plane to land in a place that it ain't scheduled to land you start a ruckus on a plane where they have to land it in a place other than where it's designated for they'll throw you in jail but they ain't gonna throw god in jail he created the storm he's the one that grounded the place branham said i laid my hand on that oh ain't jemima's back and said it was wet with a dew where she'd been out there in the wee hours of the morning how did she have that dream there's another place not right there but there's another place that brother branham tells that story and she said where's that briefcase you're supposed to be carrying brother brown said it's back in the room the ministry of jesus christ working through a mama hanging over a fence amen your mamas wonder why it is that sometimes that you have to pray and pray and pray and the baby's sick or your husband's sick and then all of a sudden something just comes over you that you drop down on them knees and you know that the windows of heaven was open and you know that your voice got heard and you say satan you're a liar you can't make my baby stay sick i claim it's healing in the name of jesus christ and you walk in and the fever's broke like that it's the ministry of jesus christ amen amen you and i are the fruits of the ministry of jesus christ amen amen how many children have we got in here 12 13 years old anybody how old are you son you're 11. that's close enough lord can speak to you son are you hearing me you dedicate your life to the lord the lord speak through you one time there's a little boy that he wasn't even but three years old and the ministry of jesus christ worked through that boy and woke him up he he had been dedicated he was taken down into eli's house his mama when when mama couldn't have a little boy that she wanted to have she said lord if you'll just let me have a little boy i i'll dedicate him to you and when the spirit of the lord was really calling out he he goes run into eli and said did you call for me said no son i ain't called for you you're going back to spit a little bit later eli heard his name called again he went in and asked eli or samuel went in and asked eli again did you cough for me no son i ain't called for you and the third time that backslid preacher realized that god was doing something three-year-old he was working through the lord jesus at 12 or 13 when he was down there amen you're never too young you're never too old if you're a preacher don't talk to me about retiring we're in a war we're not in nine to five my daddy was in world war ii i talked to a lot of veterans all the time i haven't heard of any of them that in the middle of a battle bullets whizzing all around them hey sarge i'm checking out it's five o'clock are you hearing me it ain't five o'clock yet y'all have just come up to a 25th anniversary it's a mile post are you hearing me on my way up here i seen mile markers all along the way hello cena sign said minneapolis 46 miles it doesn't tell me exactly how far it is to brooklyn center but i know i'm

ministry of jesus christ but i know i'm getting real close to my destination i've seen the mile markers 25s behind you now brooklyn center good shepherd fellowship 25s behind you i don't know how much farther we got to go but i've got a feeling we're gonna be there in just a little bit but we ain't gonna quit working yet because there's still people that do not know the lord jesus there's still people that have not come into the fullness of the baptism of the holy ghost they've not been sealed to the day of redemption there's still something for us to do we've got family members we've got friends we've got church folks with struggles that we're still going to keep provoking one another to good works i know sometimes you may think i'm a little bit of a neurotic but i want you to know i love the lord time i was preaching down in oklahoma and they there's a bunch of young men and and they was all sitting on the front row and one of them had just got into an argument with mama of course brother force didn't know anything about it and i go down and i'm preaching on the subject of provoke one another to good works you know paul wasn't always just a real pleasant guy to talk to most of us would not have wanted paul to be our pastor if your pastor got up in front of you and started preaching he said the way that y'all were acting i'm glad i didn't baptize none of y'all some of y'all say i'm of donny reagan some says i'm a tim pruitt i'm i'm glad i didn't baptize none of you would have got aggravated at him hello and hey those are good brothers i'm not throwing off on them but but it's just sometimes we we put tags on everything at any rate this boy he'd been fussing with his mama he said what are you going to do mom provoke me to do it and i walked down and grabbed that boy by the hand i said stand up and and he just sat there i pulled him up i said the scripture said provoke one another to good work he said i thought brother farmer is going to grab me by the time jerk me up no i i i wouldn't have done that but church 25 is behind us let them come to the music because a song just come to my mind and y'all's going to have to sing it because i ain't got to wash it i have not got to mile marker 26 to brooklyn center yet neither of you we don't know what lays right in front of us but the song goes like this the cross before me the world behind me the cross before me the world behind me the cross before me the world behind [Music] we ain't got time we're gonna have to run instead of walk though none go with me yet will i follow [Music] no turning back i have decided to follow jesus i have decided to follow jesus i have decided to follow you no turning back is is that what you is that where you're at in your mind if it is then you're one of them ain't you y'all know that i'm a little different key though brother [Music] i'm one of them i'm one of them now i'm so glad that i can say i'm gonna be [Music] now they were gathered in the upper room all praying they were baptized with the holy ghost when fostered service came now what he did for them that day he'll do for us to say i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them i'm one of them [Music] i'm so glad that i can say of them now come my brother claim this blessing that will cleanse your heart from sin it'll start to enjoy they'll drink the flames [Music] oh i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them [Music] [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah what an opportunity that god will give us such a privilege to be part of this ministry the ministry of jesus christ praise the lord you know after paul had his experience [Music] on the mountain after the pillar of fire met him on the road of damascus and god started dealing with that prophet and showing him the things from the old testament and all the things that that the holy spirit was was fulfilling in his church he said this thing he said god has made us able ministers of the new covenant under the old covenant he was from the tribe of benjamin he could have never been the minister he could have never been a priest but under this new covenant god has called us from all walks of life he has brought us from different backgrounds he had brought us out of different situation to this ministry praise the lord and the success of jesus ministry was to be able to put the disciples on the same platform that he was on he never belittled them he never make a big class in the small class he brought every one of them to the same platform the works that i do you will do an even greater work she will do and i believe that's where the holy spirit has brought us brother branham says you are minister with me in this covenant [Music] praise the lord if there is one thing to be grateful for with the many things that the lord has done for us is to be grateful to the place where he has made us co-workers praise the lord is the restoration of bringing us to that place where eve was with adam before the fall they were co-workers they were called equal that's the privilege you and myself have you know we sang that son just now now i decided to follow jesus the the story behind our son the inspiration came out of the ministry of thomas we spoke a little bit about that last week and all the trouble he had to believe the resurrection of jesus christ but after our lord appeared and he had an evidence of his resurrection he got on the board and sailed somewhere there in india going to all of those different tribes and different groups [Music] and uh there was in one kingdom there there were to believe the gospel accepted the lord jesus and the the the the king of the time refused and brought this man and his family to uh to a death squad and ask him when he forsake jesus he said i have decided to follow jesus and right before him his children was killed he said if no one followed no one go with me and i will still follow [Music] his wife was killed [Music] he said the cross before me and the world behind me [Music] and that stand for the world brought a conviction to the entire village that's where we got our song from as they say people in this generation we can say the same i have decided to follow jesus let's just buy our house together [Music] no matter what the enemy tried to troll in our way [Music] i got a news for him this morning we didn't call ourselves two days he called us this was not our choice this is this was not our path of choice but he called us and he placed us on this choice [Music] i have decided to follow jesus oh i have decided to follow jesus oh i decided to follow jesus no turning back no turning that oh yes i have decided to follow jesus [Music] to follow jesus [Music] oh the cross before [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the world [Music] oh [Music] lord turn me down [Music] you know there is something about anniversary when a man and a woman comes to their wedding anniversary it does not count their differences in age [Music] it counts what they have achieved together the man can be 100 years old and a woman just a 20 year old girl [Music] and as we stand together [Music] realizing that [Music] there were decisions that were made even though we were not here 25 years ago but we can put our shoulders to the wheels [Music] an anniversary brings every one of us to the same place appreciating what we have achieved together many of those that started this group has moved on to different assemblies many of us are came from different places but here we are supporting the cause of the gospel lifting up the name of jesus christ [Music] and what a message that is befitting for us to realize that we are called to the ministry of jesus [Music] christ no matter how little it is [Music] young people [Music] let's think about this and think about the word thing about the message that's preached to you this morning i said what brother farmer said this morning singing our song before he preached [Music] he filled me with the holy ghost how many of us struggled a little bit to sing that verse but yet he has been good to us [Music] one more time young people [Music] let's sing this verse again i've decided i have decided to follow jesus [Music] jesus my lord [Music] to follow jesus oh yeah [Music] to follow jesus to follow jesus my lord lord turn it down your turn if you want to recommit your decision this morning [Music] you have you made a decision some years ago then you've been troubled if you want to recommit your decision as we rededicate ourselves [Music] for the coming years that is before us oh i believe the preacher will be glad to pray with you and there's some that want to read commit themselves as we all rededicate ourselves let's lift our hands in the building if you feed our way yes lord yes jesus [Music] i pledge allegiance to the land [Music] you're not recommitting yourself to me you're not rededicating yourself to me we all are rededicating ourselves to the lord [Music] i want to do my part even if it's the least i can do in the ministry of jesus christ if it's to be a housewife to support my husband to take care of my children i want to do the least i can as a son of god as a daughter of god [Music] oh [Music] with all that i know i am [Music] one more time my brother farmer will pray for us i pledge allegiance [Music] father [Music] i know your word for this day has told us that the people take on the spirit of a pastor lord but it's not that we want to take on the spirit of brother juan but that we follow him as he follows christ lord and then when he's manifest in the holy spirit that that's the spirit that we take on lord god we thank you for this this time of of marking the distance lord but father as the song says of amazing grace your grace will lead us out grant it lord father help us all to continue to grow in your love your grace in revelation lord that if there'd be anything that we would be falling short in lord that we'd come into it in a greater abundance than we could ever imagine let it be oh god i pray father knit our hearts together in your love [Music] we commit ourselves this assembly into your hands in jesus name amen [Music] praise the lord amen amen amen thank you jesus and we will dismiss here in a little bit saying few sons to worship we were trying to look for the best restaurant to take you to today we did all that we could but we sure short distance they turn our crowd and our number down so the least we can offer you is a slice of pisa with some wings i hope you appreciate it i almost want to say that uh [Music] so right after the service we have a tent put up in the back even if you have to go just stop buying get something to eat or get a bottle of water whatever it is and we will use a little time of fellowship maybe an hour or so and then when you hear the tips playing it will be right time for us to come back here we heard the weather was going to be horribly hot today i was just praying lord oh my goodness father can you just save us from that praise the lord so let's get a bite and as soon as you hear the tip playing it would just be time for us to come have a bite fellowship with one another and then we will come right back here we follow a little bit of that of that message you know i've said this before to disassembly brother branham i was just listening to that in the dreams and the visions that led to the seals but brandon was talking about the vision he had going to brother angie bright where the lord told him he says stole the food that's how you would keep the people and i would tell you that this this revival this message has has been kept because of that obedience to what the angel told him if we never had these messages on tapes we would have been worse than any group we have it on tapes and yet we have all the problems we have different doctrines polygamy and different things that have come out of this message if we never had it on tape we would have never even knew what a true revival is and those messages on tapes i believe one of the reasons that god told his prophet is to be able to sustain an atmosphere because it's the atmosphere that brings the result if we cannot get the atmosphere we can never get the result of the book of arts the tapes are not to bring brother brandon black from the grave i look to see him in the rapture the tapes are to sustain the atmosphere that we keep this bride to the coming of the lord and that's why we play the tips for the tip does not heal you the tip builds your faith for you to receive your healing because when you hear what god has done and you hear uh uh the man of god calling by discernment it based your faith for you to believe that if god did it then he can do it now that's why it does [Music] praise the lord and and that that's why we encourage ourselves you know sometimes you play tapes like even we play tapes for our sunday school some people don't listen they just feel like well i can listen to the tip anytime i want to listen to it when you despise that it's hard for you to catch up with the atmosphere of what the holy spirit is doing in your local assembly praise the lord so the lord bless you we will sing a few songs here to worship will be dismissed and we all will leave the building we'll find a way to hang under the tent and all because of the social distance and all of that we try to do all of that just so we can be able to you know break our crowd follow the lord and as much as we can do to be able to serve the people so the lord bless you we we sing this song well we made it 25 years so why not sing amazing grace i made it over praise the lord i don't know where i left my dancing shoes this morning i'm telling i'm so tired want to bed almost four a.m this morning so let's just sing there together and then we can go and spend time with one another amen amazing grace oh yeah oh yes [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] yes [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] i'm [Music] [Music] oh [Music] praise the lord amen amen praise the lord all the way being tongley amen but we've been praising the lord we've been praying let's sing that and we'll be dismissed in jesus name [Music] oh yes we were praised
