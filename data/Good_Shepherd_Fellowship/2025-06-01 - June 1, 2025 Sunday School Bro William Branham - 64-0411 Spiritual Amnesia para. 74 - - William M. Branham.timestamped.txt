[0:36] and get the voice of God behind it.
[0:37] They'd only laugh at it and make fun of
[0:39] it. You know the old saying, fools will
[0:42] walk with hobnail shoes where angels
[0:44] fear to try.
[0:46] That's what this spiritual amnesia does.
[0:48] Makes people get to a spot to where they
[0:51] have no feeling on the inside of them.
[0:53] They don't want nothing that's
[0:55] spiritual. Take a real spiritual meeting
[0:57] where the Holy Spirit's healing the sick
[0:59] and discerning the thoughts that's in
[1:01] the heart and put it in among all the
[1:03] churches. It's a great rally out here in
[1:05] this stadium. And look what would happen
[1:06] in a few minutes. Everybody be getting
[1:08] up, walking out. They have nothing to do
[1:10] with it. They don't want nothing to do
[1:11] with it. They'll listen to some
[1:13] intellectual talk, but when it comes to
[1:15] the power of Jesus Christ and his
[1:17] resurrection and the Holy Ghost, they
[1:19] want nothing to do with it because it
[1:22] condemns them. It sets them a fire. But
[1:26] the thing that they ought to know, no
[1:28] chastisement of course is pleasant for
[1:30] the season, but it if you yield to it,
[1:32] it it brings the fruits of repentance.
[1:35] So we find out when this spiritual
[1:37] amnesia get a hold of the people, then
[1:40] they are they're in a bad condition. Now
[1:42] we find the same now. Now I want to you
[1:45] must be identified somewhere. You must
[1:48] show your life shows tonight where you
[1:52] are identified. You are identified
[1:55] either in Christ or out of Christ. You
[1:58] are not halfway. There's no such a thing
[2:01] as a drunk sober man. There's no black
[2:03] white bird. You're either a saved or
[2:06] you're not saved. You are a saint or a
[2:09] sinner. One or the other. And your
[2:11] spiritual attitude towards God's word
[2:14] identifies you exactly where you're
[2:16] standing. Amen.
[2:18] God's word vindicated proved that the
[2:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost is just the
[2:23] same as it ever was on the day of
[2:25] Pentecost or any other time. And Jesus
[2:27] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[2:29] forever. And your attitude towards that
[2:32] identifies whether you have spiritual
[2:34] amnesia or not. Right? No matter if
[2:38] you're a deacon, even if you're a
[2:39] preacher, it doesn't make you they get
[2:41] it, too. So, we find out it's contagious
[2:44] and hits the whole thing. Now we notice
[2:47] now to be an American to be American I
[2:50] must be identified with my
[2:53] nation. Now listen
[2:56] close to be an American when I am born
[2:59] here in this country I become a citizen
[3:03] and I'm uh identified with this nation.
[3:06] All it is I am.
[3:10] all that it has been. I am for I am
[3:14] identified as an American. Then I have
[3:17] to take all of its shame, all of its
[3:20] glory. Whatever it is, I am because I'm
[3:23] identified with it.
[3:26] Amen. Amen. I want you to get it. Amen.
[3:30] I'm identified as an American citizen.
[3:33] Then all it was, I am. All it is, I am.
[3:39] I must be part of it. I've got If I'm an
[3:43] American citizen, I'm part of
[3:46] America and all that it is I
[3:50] am. I must never forget this. If I want
[3:54] to remain a true American citizen, I
[3:57] must remember that I am what my nation
[4:01] is. For I'm identified with my nation.
[4:05] to forget her or or to fight for her or
[4:08] to die for her or to stand for all she
[4:12] stands for. I must stand for it.
[4:15] Amen. What my nation is, I am. What it
[4:19] stands for, I stand for it. To be a
[4:21] lawyer American, I'll be ready to die
[4:23] for it, fight for it, stand for it, do
[4:26] anything there is. I'm part of it. Amen.
[4:28] You can't pick on it without picking on
[4:30] me. When you say something against it,
[4:33] you say it against me. For I am an
[4:35] American. They say it against you as
[4:37] American. What they say against this
[4:38] nation, they say against you. For you
[4:40] are a part of it. Don't you never forget
[4:44] it. When you do, then you've got
[4:46] amnesia. Sure enough. And remember,
[4:49] you're no more American citizen when you
[4:51] can't become a part of it. You must be
[4:53] what America is. You must be also.
[4:57] I must be partakers of her. This is my
[5:00] nation. I must be partakers of her. What
[5:03] she is, I
[5:05] am. See what she was. I am. No matter
[5:10] what she was, I'm still what she was to
[5:13] be an American. I landed on Plymouth
[5:16] Rock with her with the forefathers. I
[5:19] had to. I am part of her. I wrote with
[5:23] Paul Rivere to warn her of her dangers.
[5:27] If I'm a real American citizen, I landed
[5:29] on Plymouth Rock. I rode with Paul
[5:32] Rivere to warn her of her
[5:35] danger. Do you know what I'm meaning
[5:37] now?
[5:38] I crossed the icy Delaware with George
[5:41] Washington with his barefooted
[5:43] soldiers. I was there where I'm
[5:46] identified with this nation.
[5:50] What he did there was part of me. What I
[5:53] do now is part of him. I was identified
[5:56] with Washington at the Delaware. I stood
[6:00] with Stonewall
[6:02] Jackson when the odds were so great
[6:04] against him. And they asked, "How can
[6:07] you stand like a Stonewall when the odds
[6:10] is against you?" A little bashful
[6:12] blue-eyed fellow kicking this dust with
[6:15] his boots. He said, "I never take a
[6:16] drink of water until I thank Almighty
[6:18] God for it. I have to stand like a
[6:21] stonewall with him." Amen. uh stood
[6:25] there with Stonewall Jackson to be
[6:28] American. I'm identified with him and
[6:30] his
[6:31] stand crossing Delawarees fighting
[6:33] battles. I hosted the flag. I was with
[6:37] them when they hosted the flag on Guam
[6:40] after thousands of American soldiers
[6:42] gave their life. And when that little
[6:44] group went up there and throwed the flag
[6:45] up, I was identified in that raising of
[6:48] that flag. Every one of us was all
[6:52] American citizens was identified with
[6:54] that flag hanging over Guam.
[6:57] I heard that they put that flag up
[6:59] there. Tears running down my cheeks.
[7:01] That was me. That was you. That meant us
[7:05] all when was identified there with that
[7:09] all she is I am. All her glory is my
[7:13] glory. All her shame is my shame. If
[7:16] she's done shameful things, then I have
[7:18] to stare her stand her reproach. If she
[7:20] receives glory, I receive glory with her
[7:23] because I'm identified with her. Now, to
[7:26] be identified, American has to stand for
[7:29] all America's shame, all America's
[7:31] glory, all she ever was, all she is, or
[7:33] what she will be. You are identified
[7:36] with it. Now, to be a true
[7:39] Christian, you have to be the same.
[7:43] We don't want to forget that.
[7:46] All that he
[7:47] was, I'm identified with
[7:50] him. I'm identified with him. Notice,
[7:55] and he is in me and I in
[7:58] him. Notice that every Christian that's
[8:02] a real genuine Christian Christian was
[8:05] with him when the morning stars sang
[8:07] together and the sons of God shouted for
[8:10] joy before there was the foundation of
[8:11] the world. We were identified in the
[8:15] immortal realms with God 10 million
[8:18] years before the world was ever formed.
[8:21] I was back there with him if we got
[8:23] eternal life. I was there with him. I
[8:25] was identified with him when the morning
[8:27] stars sang together and the sons of God
[8:29] shouted for joy. I was with him when he
[8:32] called
[8:33] Abraham at the age of of 75 years old
[8:38] and his wife being
[8:39] 65 and told him they were going to have
[8:42] a baby. I was with him when he took his
[8:46] stand up on thus sayaeth the Lord. I'm
[8:48] going to have the baby. I stood with
[8:50] him. Every other Christian stood with
[8:52] him. Amen.
[8:54] I was with him when his temptations
[8:56] come. I was with him when he went up on
[8:59] top of the mountain to offer up Isaac. I
[9:01] was with him when the ram appeared. I
[9:04] was with Joseph when he was rejected of
[9:06] his brothers because he was spiritual
[9:09] and the rest of them was carnal. I was
[9:12] with him when I know the reproach he had
[9:14] to stand by his own brothers. What he
[9:17] was I am. Amen. What I am, he was. For
[9:22] we are all one in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[9:28] I was with Joseph in his cave grave. I
[9:32] was with him when he went to the right
[9:34] hand of Pharaoh. You had to be
[9:36] identified with him. I was with Jacob
[9:39] that night when he wrestled all night
[9:41] with the
[9:43] angel. I wrestled myself. I know what he
[9:45] went through with. So I wrestle with
[9:47] Jacob the same time he did.
[9:51] For I am his brother. I was with Moses
[9:55] when he went out into Egypt. I was with
[9:58] Moses at the burning bush. If you're a
[10:01] Christian, you are identified with them
[10:03] Bible characters.
[10:05] Don't forget it. Amen. I was with Moses
[10:08] when all the people turned against him.
[10:11] I was with Moses when he crossed the Red
[10:13] Sea. When he raised his hand and walked
[10:15] forward and the Red Sea opened. I was
[10:18] identified in Christ right then and I
[10:20] was with Moses at that hour. Hallelujah.
[10:23] Whatever Christians has been, whatever
[10:25] believers has been, every believer now
[10:27] is identified with that same person.
[10:30] Whatever it is, you must be identified.
[10:33] Don't forget that. When you do, you got
[10:35] spiritual
[10:37] amnesia. You've forgotten who you are
[10:40] now. Identified with him, with Moses
[10:43] when he crossed the sea. I was with
[10:45] Elijah in the days of Ahab when they had
[10:48] to make a choice who they would serve.
[10:52] God our Balum. We was with him on Mount
[10:56] Carmel when he had to make this choice
[11:00] for we are identified in the body of the
[11:03] same God that he was identified in. So
[11:06] if we are identified in that body then
[11:09] we must remember we were there with him.
[11:14] Right now I was with David when he was
[11:17] rejected by his own brethren.
[11:20] I was with David. You were too if you're
[11:23] a Christian. You have to be identified
[11:25] in his
[11:28] rejection. I was with the Hebrew
[11:30] children in the fiery
[11:32] furnace when the the fire couldn't burn
[11:35] him because of the presence of the
[11:37] fourth man. I was with Daniel in the
[11:40] lion's den. I was identified in there.
[11:43] When the angel of the Lord
[11:45] identified him in there, I most surely
[11:49] was with him at
[11:51] Calvary. I must be identified with him
[11:54] at Calvary. Amen. I must be there to a
[11:57] place that where not also was I
[11:59] identified with him at Calvary, I died
[12:02] with him at Calvary. Every Christian
[12:05] must die with him at Calvary. If you
[12:07] don't die with him at Calvary, you can't
[12:09] be none of his. I was there when he
[12:11] died. I died with him and then I was
[12:14] with him when he raised up from the
[12:16] dead. Hallelujah. I come up on Easter
[12:19] morning with him in the resurrection.
[12:21] Whatever he did, I was right there with
[12:23] him. Every believer was the same. And
[12:26] now I am seated with him in heavenly
[12:29] places in Christ Jesus with all the
[12:32] powers of hell conquered to him.
[12:35] Every Christian believer was seated the
[12:37] same way because you have to be
[12:39] identified.
[12:40] Now I find myself in this last days with
[12:43] the many of the believing Christians
[12:45] identified in his
[12:47] ministry. He is the same yesterday,
[12:50] today and forever. I find myself in this
[12:53] day identified in his ministry. Do you
[12:56] find yourself that way believing it,
[12:58] walking with it? Notice the works that
[13:01] he did. He said the believer would do
[13:04] the same
[13:05] thing. The works that I do shall you
[13:08] also. Then can you be identified with
[13:10] him? Then when the reproach comes on the
[13:13] word, can you stand the reproach like he
[13:16] did? See, identified with him. I was
[13:19] identified with him. I was with him at
[13:21] the day of Pentecost. I was with the
[13:23] disciples up there. Identified with them
[13:26] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I
[13:29] wonder if the church hasn't got amnesia
[13:32] so much now that they don't, some of
[13:33] them don't even believe there is such a
[13:34] thing as the Holy Ghost.
[13:36] See where the church has got a very bad
[13:39] case of amnesia. See, they have
[13:42] forgotten that that was Jesus Christ
[13:44] back there. They have forgotten what
[13:46] Jesus Christ was. They have forgotten.
[13:48] They thought he was just a a lawmaker or
[13:51] a prophet or a good man. They forgot
[13:54] that he was God. They forgot that he's
[13:56] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[13:58] And the church has got a bad case of
[14:00] spiritual amnesia. They have forgotten
[14:03] all these things. They don't understand
[14:05] it no more. We must be with the
[14:07] disciples at Pentecost. Identify with
[14:10] them. I was identified with Peter's
[14:12] sermon on the day of Pentecost in Acts
[14:14] the 2 chapter. I heard what he said. I
[14:18] believe what he said. I obeyed what he
[14:20] said. Now I'm identified in the same
[14:22] thing. Amen.
[14:24] Don't get spiritual amnesia cause you
[14:27] will you identify yourself with
[14:28] something else. Stay right with that
[14:30] word. was with the church when it was
[14:33] commissioned by Jesus Christ in Acts the
[14:35] 16th chapter. Go ye into all the world
[14:37] and preach the gospel to every creature.
[14:39] I want to be identified there. All the
[14:42] world to every creature. These signs
[14:44] shall follow them that
[14:47] believe can be identified in that. Well,
[14:51] are you identified with that? Or have
[14:52] you got some spiritual amnesia that you
[14:55] find out you don't believe those signs
[14:57] follow the believers? See, if you don't
[15:00] believe it, then you have spiritual
[15:02] amnesia. See, you've forgotten that God
[15:04] promised that. He said, "These signs
[15:07] shall follow them that believe." Don't
[15:10] forget it. You can't forget it to be a
[15:12] Christian. You must be identified with
[15:15] it. You must be identified with St. John
[15:17] the 14th chapter, the 12th verse. He
[15:19] that believeth in me, the works that I
[15:22] do shall he do also. Don't forget it.
[15:27] If you do, then you've got spiritual
[15:30] amnesia. You've forgotten who you are.
[15:32] You've forgotten what your testimony
[15:35] means. How about he said, "If you abide
[15:38] in me and my word in you, you can ask
[15:40] what you will and it'll be done for
[15:41] you." Are you identified there to
[15:44] believe it? That is the truth. Mark 11,
[15:46] when he said, "If you say to this
[15:47] mountain, be moved and don't doubt in
[15:49] your heart, but believe that what you
[15:51] have said will come to pass, you can
[15:53] have what you've said." Amen. Can you be
[15:55] identified there to believe it? That is
[15:56] the truth. If it hasn't, then you're
[15:58] getting spiritual amnesia and it it you
[16:02] forget you lose your Christian balance.
[16:06] You can't tell where you've belong. You
[16:08] say, "I'm Methodist. I'm Baptist. That's
[16:09] what I know about it. I'm Pentecostal.
[16:11] I'm this that the other." Watch out.
[16:13] That may mean that the disease sign is
[16:16] showing on you that you've got some
[16:18] spiritual
[16:19] amnesia. You say, "Well, brother
[16:21] Brandon, I believe this. I don't Now
[16:23] wait just a minute. If God promised to
[16:26] do these things and said they'd be in
[16:27] the last days and your creed will keep
[16:30] you promised. That's a good sign. I can
[16:33] see the disease sign on you. It's
[16:36] spiritual amnesia. You have forgotten to
[16:39] identify yourself with the word. Amen.
[16:42] That's right. You say, "I don't believe
[16:45] that the sick are healed." You got
[16:46] spiritual amnesia.
[16:49] You say, "I don't believe in the baptism
[16:50] of the Holy Ghost." Spiritual amnesia.
[16:53] You say, "I I don't believe that God
[16:55] promised to do these things in the last
[16:56] days." Then you've listened to a creed
[16:58] or some doctrine instead of the Bible.
[17:00] You have spiritual amnesia. Amen. You
[17:03] don't know where you do belong, man.
[17:05] You're confessing a Christian and
[17:07] denying the word. Amen. Brings you right
[17:09] back to spiritual amnesia again.
[17:12] Don't know where you stand. You got
[17:14] spiritual amnesia. You can't identify
[17:17] yourself with the scriptures. You have
[17:19] to be with the disciples. You have to be
[17:20] with all the scripture. with the church
[17:23] when his commission. But now when the
[17:25] church was commissioned, go ye into all
[17:27] the world and preach the gospel. These
[17:29] signs shall follow them and believe.
[17:32] That was her
[17:33] commission. Now they have that was the
[17:36] commission. But they have gotten a bad
[17:39] case of this spiritual amnesia just like
[17:41] Eve got on the on her around through the
[17:45] garden one
[17:46] day. Now she's like Israel suffering
[17:50] from this same disease. an allergy from
[17:53] a seminary diet that'll give you
[17:56] spiritual amnesia. Get some seminary
[17:59] diet and you'll get an allergy and then
[18:02] the first thing you know you'll get
[18:03] amnesia real bad. You won't believe
[18:04] anything the Bible
[18:06] says. That's what's the matter with the
[18:08] church today. That's what's the matter.
[18:10] We can't have revival today. That's
[18:12] what's the matter with the people today.
[18:13] They've been so drug over coals of
[18:15] everything and every ism it could hatch
[18:17] up till they don't know what is right
[18:19] and wrong. Exactly. Amen. She can't
[18:23] remember her Lord. She can't remember
[18:25] his word. She can't remember the
[18:27] promise. That was what was the matter
[18:29] with Israel when Jesus come on the
[18:31] scene. They could not remember that a
[18:34] virgin shall conceive. They could not
[18:36] remember that Moses said, "The Lord your
[18:38] God shall raise up a prophet like unto
[18:40] me." Amen. They had spiritual amnesia.
[18:44] That's exactly what the church has got
[18:45] today. He said, "It shall come to pass
[18:47] in the last days that these things would
[18:49] take place that we taking place and the
[18:51] church set just apostles. Amen. What is
[18:55] it? Spiritual amnesia. Amen. We call
[18:58] ourselves Pentecost and can't divide and
[19:00] can't identify ourselves in the word
[19:02] preaching the power of the
[19:06] resurrection. And doing exactly what he
[19:09] said he would do. Then watch out. Our
[19:11] denominational system has got us into
[19:13] spiritual amnesia.
[19:15] We're suffering. We don't know where we
[19:17] belong. One takes his papers from this
[19:19] church to the other church and this
[19:21] church and this ism and that isn't. See
[19:23] what we need again is another Amos to
[19:26] come on the scene. But thus sayeth the
[19:29] Lord. Amen.
[19:31] Would we receive him? Not like they did.
[19:34] They never received him. They wouldn't
[19:35] receive him today. He couldn't get his
[19:37] head in a place hardly to preach. That's
[19:40] exactly right. Because the church is
[19:42] suffering with this spiritual amnesia.
[19:44] Now why God promised in this last days
[19:48] when the son of man would be revealed
[19:50] according to Luke 17th chapter at the
[19:52] sign it was taking place as Sodom would
[19:55] take place again. And the people see it
[19:58] done and some of them don't even believe
[20:00] it. They think it's telepathy. They
[20:02] think it's a devil spirit. What is it?
[20:05] They're suffering with spiritual
[20:07] amnesia.
[20:09] Exactly. They can't understand their
[20:10] Lord. Jesus Christ is the same
[20:13] yesterday, today, and forever. What he
[20:14] was then, he is now.
[20:17] Amen. But what's happened? Just can't
[20:20] identify herself no more with the word.
[20:22] Why? She she don't know whether she's a
[20:24] lodge or whether she's a church. She
[20:27] don't want to be called a lodge and she
[20:28] can't be called a church. Course to be
[20:30] called a church would identify herself
[20:32] with Christ. That gives her spiritual
[20:34] amnesia and she don't want to be called
[20:35] a lodge. So it ain't the Pentecostal
[20:37] church, the Methodist church, the
[20:38] Baptist church. It's a Pentecostal
[20:40] lodge, Methodist lodge, and Baptist
[20:41] lodge because she can't be identified
[20:44] with the word. And when the word's made
[20:46] manifest, they still don't believe it.
[20:49] Disease, spiritual amnesia.
[20:51] Can't identify themselves. They don't
[20:53] know where they belong.
[20:55] That's right. It's just exactly like
[20:58] hybriding something. As I've often said,
[21:01] I always thought one of the most dumbest
[21:03] things I ever seen was a mule. See, he's
[21:06] a hybrid. See, his mother was a mayor.
[21:09] His daddy was a donkey. And he don't
[21:12] even know where he belongs. And the
[21:13] first thing you know, you you you can
[21:15] breed him and get a donkey and that or
[21:18] get the mule, but the mule can't breed
[21:19] itself back again. See, he don't you
[21:23] can't teach him nothing. He's
[21:24] hard-headed. You'll never do anything.
[21:27] You accept them big long years and he'll
[21:28] wait the longest day of his life just
[21:30] before he dies to kick you. That's all.
[21:33] He's always waiting for something to
[21:34] bust it on you if he can. That puts in
[21:36] mind a lot of so-called hybrid
[21:38] Christians. They've hybrid in a church
[21:40] until they got the disease of
[21:41] spiritualism.
[21:43] They can't reproduce nothing again. You
[21:46] talk about hybrid corn. Hybrid corn is
[21:48] nothing. It's the worst thing you ever
[21:49] put in your mouth. Anything
[21:51] hybrid. That's the reason you have to
[21:53] take these little hot bed plants and
[21:55] hybrid stuff and spray it and doctor it
[21:57] and baby it. Why? Because it can't keep
[22:00] the bugs off of it. But a genuine fair
[22:03] bread, you don't have to put no
[22:04] disinfect on him. He's got power within
[22:07] yourself.
[22:09] Take that keep the bugs of unbelief off.
[22:12] But a real genuine spirited man. Take an
[22:16] old mule and you're going to talk to
[22:17] him. Say, "Say boy, I want you to do
[22:19] this." You
[22:21] su big ears working them down. I've seen
[22:24] a a lot of Christians about like that.
[22:26] Soal. You say Jesus Christ the same
[22:29] yesterday and forever. These signs shall
[22:31] follow that believe. Huh. I believe the
[22:32] days of miracles is passed. Huh? Huh?
[22:35] See, he don't know what he does believe.
[22:37] He don't know. He don't know where he
[22:39] come from. He don't know where he's
[22:40] going.
[22:45] He's got horse amnesia.
[22:48] He don't know where he come from. He
[22:50] can't go no farther. But I like a
[22:52] genuine thoroughbred. Oh, he's gentle.
[22:55] You can talk to him. He knows who his
[22:57] papa was, who his mama was, who his
[22:58] grandpa and grandma was. He's got
[23:00] pedigreed papers to show where he come
[23:02] from. Not like a pedigreed Christian
[23:04] that can go all the way back to the word
[23:06] of God to the day of paper and identify
[23:09] themselves there with the saint where
[23:11] the power of the Holy Ghost came upon
[23:13] them. That's a pedigreed Christian. He
[23:16] knows where he come from. He's not
[23:18] identified with Methodist, Baptist, or
[23:19] nothing else. He's identified in God's
[23:21] word. He knows exactly where he's
[23:23] standing with.
[23:26] The royal blood of his father flows
[23:28] through him. The blood of Jesus Christ.
[23:31] He knows what it does. He believes every
[23:33] word. God works through him and confirms
[23:35] it with the signs that he promised to
[23:37] follow. He hasn't got no spiritual
[23:39] amnesia. He's a genuine. Hallelujah.
[23:42] Third bread. I like that. But the church
[23:45] today has got a bad case of spiritual
[23:47] amnesia. It doesn't know where it
[23:49] belongs. It's forgot all about it.
[23:51] Forgot all these things that makes it a
[23:53] church. What made us so rich as we are?
[23:56] It's got into the place of Lady Osia
[23:58] again. Back into that rich place like
[24:00] Israel was when it was poor and had to
[24:02] trust God for everything it could do.
[24:04] Everything that God had trusted God.
[24:06] Then God was with it and it was
[24:08] spiritually moved on. But when it got
[24:10] rich, here's what happened. Their cities
[24:12] built up and their women got immoral.
[24:15] Their man permitted it. Their preachers
[24:17] let down the bar and their denounced the
[24:20] prophets. And that's the kind of a
[24:22] condition they got into. What caused
[24:24] that? But forgetting where them
[24:26] blessings come from. Amen. Do you
[24:29] Methodist? Are you Baptist? Are you
[24:31] Presbyterian? You Methodist, can you
[24:33] remember John Wesley?
[24:35] You Baptist John Smith wept for the
[24:39] affairs of people till his wife would
[24:41] have to lead him to the table. His eyes
[24:43] swell shut from crying and praying all
[24:46] night
[24:48] long. What's the matter? John Wesley
[24:50] said one of the great things I believe
[24:53] it was one of the early Methodist
[24:54] fathers said the disgrace of the
[24:56] daughters of the Methodist church was
[24:58] being beginning to get so early they
[25:00] were wearing rings upon their finger.
[25:02] What would he say now with shorts on
[25:03] them? What happened? Spiritual evil.
[25:08] That's right. Exactly what it is. Forot
[25:11] where you come from. You've got all
[25:14] these things because God's goodness
[25:16] goodness did it to you. Do you think
[25:18] this is a
