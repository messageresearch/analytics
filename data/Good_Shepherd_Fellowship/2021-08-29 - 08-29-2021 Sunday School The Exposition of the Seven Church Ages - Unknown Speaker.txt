========================================

[Music] so [Music] no one can deny that educated men say that all they did was pour water on them because it was easy to find little holes of water in many places and when they pour water on them they do it in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost as if those titles were real names and as if there were three gods instead of just one but stay in that organization and try and preach the truth of immersion in the name of the lord jesus christ and you will be put out you couldn't be led of god and stay in there it is impossible now paul was a prophet taught by the holy ghost if paul baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and said anyone that did different from his preaching was accursed then it is time to wake up and see that the church is no longer controlled by the holy ghost but it is controlled by the nicolaitans acts 20 27-30 for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them paul saw it coming but he warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with its false doctrines he knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a holy spirit ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it this is a far cry from paul who said that when all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship and the church corporate has never learned this lesson from the scripture nor from history every time god gives a visitation of the holy spirit and people get free after a while they bind themselves right back to the very thing they came out of when luther came out of catholicism the people stayed free for a while but when he died the people simply organized what they thought he believed and set up their own creeds and ideas and repudiated anyone who said opposite to what they said they went right back to catholicism with a little different form and right today many lutherans are ready to go all the way back oh yes in revelation 12 that old had many daughters these daughters are just like mother they set the word aside deny the work of the spirit of god subjugate the laity and make it impossible for the laity to worship god unless they come through them or through their pattern which is nothing but a blueprint of unbelief from satan himself where oh where are we spiritually we are in a wilderness of darkness how far we have wandered from the first church pentecost is nowhere in view and the word cannot be found apostolic succession which today abounds is not found in the word it is a man-made device it supersedes illegally the truth that god not man has set his leaders in the church peter was not even in rome yet they lie and say he was history proves he was not there are people who read history but shrug their shoulders and go back to believing a lie where can you find the vicar of christ in the word no one takes his place yet it has been done and people accept it where can you find that added revelation is accepted by god especially revelation contrary to one already given yet they accept it and rest on it where do you find a purgatory where do you find a mass where do you find paying money to get out of hell it is not in the word but men put it in their own book and by it took over the people ruling them by fear where do you find that man has the power to forgive us as though he were god grievous wolves is hardly strong enough to describe them nicolaitanism organization man over man get back to god repent before it is too late see the handwriting on the wall it is writing judgment as the sacred vessels were desecrated and thus brought the wrath of god now the sacred word has been desecrated and the spirit grieved and judgment is here even at the door repent repent go back to pentecost back to the leadership of the holy ghost back to the word of god for why will ye die the voice of the spirit revelation 2 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches it may be that millions will hear these words or read them but how many will pay heed to them that we do not know but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of god enlightening him if your ear is open to the word the spirit of god will make the word real to you now that is a work of the spirit i can teach you the truth but if you don't open your ear to hear it and your heart to receive it you won't get the revelation now notice it says that the spirit is speaking to the churches that is plural not singular the spirit did not have john write this down for a local ephesian church nor for the first age only it is for all church ages but this is the church of beginnings and thus it is like the book of genesis what started in genesis holds true throughout the entire word and finally closes out in revelation thus this church beginning in acts is god's blueprint for all ages until she closes out in the laodicean age watch it carefully let every age take heed for what is going on here is only the start that little tree that was planted is going to grow it is going to grow through the ages this then is a message for every christian through every age until jesus comes yes it is for it is the spirit speaking amen the reward promised revelation 2 7 to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god this is the future reward to all overcomers of all ages when the last call to battle has been sounded when our armor has been laid down then we will rest in the paradise of god and our portion shall be the tree of life forever the tree of life isn't that a beautiful figure of speech it is mentioned three times in the book of genesis and three times in the book of revelation in all six places it is the same tree and symbolizes exactly the same thing but what is the tree of life well first of all we would have to know what the tree itself stands for in numbers 24 6 as balaam described israel he said they were trees of line aloes which the lord hath planted trees throughout the scriptures refer to persons as in psalm 1. thus the tree of life must be the person of life and that is jesus now in the garden of eden there were two trees standing in the midst of it one was the tree of life the other was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil man was to live by the tree of life but he was not to touch the other tree or he would die but man did partake of the other tree and when he did death entered into him by his sin and he became separated from god now that tree back there in eden that tree which was the source of life was jesus in john chapters 6 through 8 jesus sets himself forth as the source of eternal life he called himself the bread from heaven he spoke of giving himself and that if a man ate of him he would never die he proclaimed that he knew abraham and that before abraham he was he prophesied that he himself would give them living waters that if man drank he would never thirst again but would live eternally he showed himself as the great i am he is the bread of life the well of life the eternal one the tree of life he was back there in eden in the midst of the garden even as he will be in the midst of the paradise of god some have an idea that the two trees in the garden were just two more trees like unto the rest of those that god had placed there but careful students know that this is not so when john the baptist cried that the ax was laid to the root of all trees he was not talking of simply natural trees but of spiritual principles now in first john 5 11 it says and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son jesus said in john 5 40 and ye will not come to me that ye might have life thus the record god's word states plainly and clearly that life eternal life is in the sun it is no other place first john 5 12 he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life now since the record cannot change be taken from or added there unto then the record stands that the life is in the sun since this is so the tree in the garden has to be jesus all right if the tree of life is a person then the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is a person also it can't be otherwise thus the righteous one and the wicked one stood side by side there in the midst of the garden of eden ezekiel 28 13 a thou satan has been in eden the garden of god here is where we receive the true revelation of the serpent's seed here is what really happened in the garden of eden the word says that eve was beguiled by the serpent she was actually seduced by the serpent it says in genesis 3 1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made this beast was so close to a human being and yet was pure animal that he could reason and talk he was an upright creature and was somewhat in between a chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man he was so close to being human that his seed could and did mingle with that of the woman and cause her to conceive when this happened god cursed the serpent he changed every bone in the serpent's body so that he had to crawl like a snake science can try all it wants to and it won't find the missing link god saw to that man is smart and he can see an association of man with animal and he tries to prove it out of evolution there isn't any evolution but man and animal did mingle that's one of the mysteries of god that has remained hidden but here it is revealed it happened right back there in the midst of eden when eve turned away from life to accept death notice what god said to them in the garden genesis 3 15 and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel if we give credit to the word that the woman did have a seed then the serpent must have surely had a seed also if the seed of the woman was a man child apart from the man then the seed of the serpent will have to be in the same pattern and that is another male must be born apart from human male instrumentality there is no student who does not know that the seed of the woman was the christ who came by the instrumentality of god apart from human intercourse it is also just as well known that the predicted bruising of the serpent's head was an actuality of prophecy concerning what christ would accomplish against satan at the cross there at the cross christ would bruise the head of satan while satan would bruise the heel of the lord this portion of scripture is the revelation of how the literal seed of the serpent was sown in the earth even as we have the account of luke 1 26-35 wherein is set forth the exact account of how the seed of the woman came into physical manifestation apart from the instrumentality of the human male and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god as the seed of the woman was literally god reproducing himself in human flesh so the seed of the serpent is the literal way that satan found he was able to open the door to himself into the human race it was impossible for satan for he is only a created spirit being to reproduce himself in the manner which god reproduced himself so the genesis account tells how he produced his seed and introduced or injected himself into the human race also recall that satan is called the serpent it is his seed or injection into the human race we are speaking of before adam ever had carnal knowledge of eve the serpent had that knowledge ahead of him and that one born of it was cain cain was of born of begotten of that wicked one first john 3 12 the holy spirit in john could not in one place call adam the wicked one for that is what he would be if he fathered cain and in another place called adam the son of god which he was by creation luke 3 38 cain turned out in character like his father a bringer of death a murderer his utter defiance of god when faced by the almighty in genesis 4 5 9 13 and 14 show him to be absolutely unhuman-like in characteristics seeming even to surpass any account we have in scripture concerning a confrontation of satan by god but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me notice the exact way the record of god sets forth the account of the births of cain abel and seth genesis 4 1 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord and she again bear his brother abel genesis 4 25 and adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name seth there are three sons born from two acts of carnal knowledge by adam since the bible is the exact and perfect word of god there is no mistake but a record for our illumination since three sons were born from two acts by adam you know positively that one of those three was not the son of adam god has recorded this in this exact manner to show us something the truth of the matter is that eve had in her womb two sons twins from separate impregnations she was carrying twins with kane's conception sometime previous to that of abel's see those twins again perfect type as always to those who think that this is not possible let it be known that the medical records are replete with cases where women have carried twins who were of separate over and separate insemination with the fertilization of the eggs being days apart and not only so but some of the records show that the twins were fathered by separate males recently worldwide coverage was given to a norwegian mother who was suing her husband for support for herself and her twins one of which was white and the other black she admitted that she had a negro lover the two conceptions were about three weeks apart in beaumont texas in 1963 the records again set forth a multiple birth where in pregnancies were many days apart in fact so much so that the woman almost died along with one child in childbirth now why did this have to be so why was it that the seed of the serpent must come this way man was created for god man was to be the temple of god the place of god's rest the holy spirit was man the temple acts 7 46-51 who found favor before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob but solomon built him an house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will ye build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye satan has known this all along he also wants to indwell man even as god so does but god has reserved to himself that right satan cannot do that god alone appeared in human flesh satan could not and cannot do that he does not have creative powers the only way for satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the serpent in eden even as he entered by evil spirits into the swine at gadara god does not enter animals but satan can and will to accomplish his ends he could not have a child directly by eve as did god by mary so he entered into the serpent and then beguiled eve he seduced her and by her did satan have a child vicariously cain bore the full spiritual characteristics of satan and the animalistic sensual fleshly characteristic of the serpent no wonder the holy spirit said that cain was of that wicked one he was now i want to go into some certain proof we have that there is a definite affinity between man and animal it is a physical thing do you know that you can take the embryo cells from an unborn fetus and inject them into human beings then those thyroid cells will go right to the human thyroid the kidney cells will go right to the human kidneys do you realize how stupendous this is some intelligence guides those animal cells exactly to the right place that intelligence accepts those cells and puts them in exactly the right place there is an affinity between animal and man they can't intermingle and reproduce that has been tried but back in the garden that intermingling did take place and the chemical affinity which still exists proves it for back in eden the serpent was an upright creature he was close to man he was almost man satan took advantage of the serpent's physical characteristics to use him to beguile eve then god destroyed that pattern of the serpent no other beast can commingle with man but the affinity is there now that we have come this far let me try to crystallize your thinking on this subject so you can see the necessity of our going into the serpent seed doctrine as i have we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life was jesus the other tree is definitely satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree now then we know that both of those trees had a relationship to man or they would never have been placed there they must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of god in their relationship to mankind and to himself or we could never impute omniscience unto god this is all true so far is it not now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the earth the purpose of god was to share his eternal life with man ephesians 1 4-11 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will revelation 13 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him satan whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world but that life could not and would not be shared in any other way than through the way of god manifest in the flesh this was a part of his eternal and predestinated purpose this plan was to be to the praise of the glory of his grace it was the plan of redemption it was the plan of salvation now listen closely god being a savior it was necessary that he predestinate a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being that is one hundred percent correct and multitudes of scripture bear it out as does the very pointed verse of romans 11 36 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first but before god could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to raise and save man had to fall the fall which would be caused by satan had to have flesh to make fall satan had to come through flesh also but satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would christ come in human flesh to restore the fallen but there was an animal the serpent so close to man that satan could get to that beast and through that beast he could get to human flesh and cause the fall and inject himself thereby into the human race even as jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies like unto his glorified one thus what god worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan and when satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of god then man could not get to the tree of life in the garden certainly not it wasn't time but an animal animal had caused a fall had it not but animal life be shed was taken and his blood shed and then god had communion with man again then there was to come a day when god would appear in flesh and by means of his humiliation he would restore fallen men and make him a partaker of that life eternal once you see this you can understand the serpent seed and know that it was no apple evade no it was the degradation of humanity by intermingling the seed now i know in answering one question another one is apt to come up and people ask me if eve fell that way what did adam do for god lays the blame on adam that is simple the word of god is forever settled in heaven before one speck of star dust was made that word god's law was there exactly as it is written in our bible now the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she is an adulteress and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back that word was true in eden as it was true when moses wrote it in the law the word can't change adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway she was a part of him and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself he would not let her go so eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he sold the human race into sin that he might have eve for he loved her and so those two sons were born sons that would be the fathers of the human race that was even now polluted and what does the record say of them read the record jude 14 and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied genesis 5 is the chapter of genealogy of enoch it gives that genealogy thusly one adam two seth three enos four kanan five mahilalil six jared seven enoch notice that kane is not mentioned the line of adam goes through seth if cain were the child of adam the law of the birthright would have given cain the right in the lineage also it must be noted carefully that in genesis 5 3 it says that adam lived 130 years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name seth nowhere does it say that cain was in adam's likeness yet he would have to be if he were his son for the law of reproduction is emphatically that each brings forth after its likeness we must also credit the fact that in both genealogies in genesis and luke cain is missing if cain were the son of adam it would be said of him somewhere that cain which was the son of adam which was the son of god it does not say that for it cannot say that of course students for a long time have set forth two lines of men one of which was the godly line found in seth and the other the ungodly line as founded by cain and it is strange but true these same students have never told us how it was that cain was the kind of person he was while abel and seth were of the spiritual godly line factually cain should have been spiritual and able less spiritual and seth even more so and right on down the line because each succeeding generation has always gotten further away from god but no cain comes forth as wicked as no man ever has been described for he violently withstands god and the word now let this be known scripture does not play with words whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eyes to see it is there for a purpose in that word it says genesis 3 20 and adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living but no scripture ever says that adam is the father of all living if there is not this connotation to be placed upon genesis 3 20 why would it be mentioned that eve is the mother of all and no word said about adam the fact is that though eve was the mother of all living adam was not the father of all living in genesis 4 1 eve said i have gotten a man from the lord she does not credit adam with the fatherhood of cain but in genesis 4 25 she says for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew she does not say god had given her another seed that would have been christ for he is given this son seth was appointed instead of abel she recognizes her son that came by adam she does not now recognize cain for he came by the serpent when she says another seed instead of abel she is saying that cain was different from abel for if they were of the same father she would have had to say i have been given some more seed i don't believe everything i read but it is certainly a curious thing that the march 1 1963 issue of life reports psychiatrists as saying exactly the same thing we are discussing now i know that all psychiatrists don't agree with each other but here it is the fear of snakes is not a conscious revulsion but an unconscious one if it were a natural fear people would just as happily stand fascinated before the gorilla or lion cages their unconscious thoughts keep them staring at snakes that lure of snakes is unconsciously sexual that it has been through the ages is seen by the people in generation after generation going through the same thing snakes have always been and always will be repulsively attractive the snake has always stood for that which is both good and bad it has been a phallic symbol through the ages just exactly as the garden of eden description we find the serpent the personification of passionate evil it is almost universal amongst the various uncultured tribes that the snake is associated with sex and often worshiped in conjunction with it the study of sexology brings that out in many instances now i would like to know where these people got that from seeing they are uneducated and never read the bible but even as the story of the flood is known throughout the world so is this truth of the fall of man known they knew what happened there in eden now right here someone is going to ask me this question did god tell eve to watch out for the serpent or the serpent would seduce her now listen god didn't have to say one thing about what would happen just get the point of the story he simply gave the word he said not to partake of knowledge partake of life life was the word of god death was anything that wasn't the word of god she allowed one word to be changed and right then satan had her god could have said don't pick more fruit off the trees than you can eat satan could say look that is quite right you see if you pick too much it will rot but here is a method of preserving the fruit and yet at the same time you can pick all you want so you see you can have your way and god's way at the same time the devil would have her right there he that is guilty in one point of the law has broken the whole law don't fool with that word that is exactly what happened in the ephesian age before it ran out in about 170 a.d and what did that tree produce the tree of knowledge produced death cain killed his brother abel the wicked killed the righteous it set a pattern it will keep that pattern until the restoration of all things as spoken by the prophets the tree of knowledge produced clever men men of renown but their ways are the ways of death god's people are simple but spiritual minded leaning toward god and nature calmly tilling the soil caring for truth rather than wealth the seed of the serpent has brought tremendous commerce wonderful inventions but with it all comes death their gunpowder and atomic bombs kill in war and in peace time their mechanical inventions such as the car kill even more in a time of peace than do the inventions of war destroy in times of trouble death and destruction are the fruits of her laborers but they are religious they believe in god they are like their father the devil and their ancestor cain both of them believed in god they go to church they mingle with the righteous as do tears mingle with the wheat in so doing they corrupt and produce a nicolaitan religion they spread their poison in every effort to destroy the seed of god even as cain killed abel there is no fear of god before their eyes but god loses none of his own he keeps them even in death and has promised that in the last day he will raise them up conclusion to him [Music] [Music] so do [Music] so [Music] so [Music]
