[13:18] Hallelujah put your hands together for
[13:20] Jesus this morning Hallelujah all right
[13:24] let's go ahead and SE we have a
[13:25] testimony this morning God bless you
[13:27] Sister Naomi
[13:56] hello you
[14:11] um thank you praise the Lord um I give
[14:14] this testimony for the glory of God and
[14:16] thank all you Saints for your prayers
[14:18] for my brother Joel I have a really
[14:22] interesting testimony to tell you and it
[14:25] could take a long time so I'm going to
[14:26] cut it really short my brother Joel is a
[14:30] doctor he's retired because of having
[14:33] had multiple aneurysms over the course
[14:36] of years and it was too becoming too
[14:39] stressful and so he's had all these
[14:41] surgeries um I don't even know how many
[14:44] at least six major
[14:46] surgeries um this last time when he went
[14:50] to the doctor and he found out he had
[14:52] another aneurism he said I'm done I'm
[14:56] not doing any more surgeries I'm just is
[14:59] going to trust the Lord to shrink this
[15:03] aneurysm and he said I'll go back in 6
[15:05] months and have him have the doctor
[15:08] check but he said I'm just going to
[15:10] trust the Lord to shrink it it was 10 cm
[15:14] or and it's the biggest one he's ever
[15:17] had now there's a lot of medical people
[15:20] here so I'm sure you know what that
[15:22] means okay they have to they have to
[15:24] cool down the brain and everything in
[15:26] order to have this surgery it's really J
[15:30] anyway um in the course of his trusting
[15:33] the
[15:34] Lord for this last one to
[15:38] shrink he woke up um let's see three
[15:42] days ago and he felt like he needed to
[15:45] cough and when he did there was blood
[15:48] came
[15:49] out and so he was rushed to the hospital
[15:52] because he has this theorder that's so
[15:55] huge again and they they put him in and
[15:59] they said his bronchial tubes were
[16:02] leaking blood from that AA that's
[16:05] enlarged and so even my brother who's
[16:08] been very positive and trust the Lord
[16:10] all these
[16:13] years he was resigning himself to death
[16:16] actually but I I went up there to the
[16:19] hospital he was in ICU and I just I
[16:22] believe in what you say makes a
[16:26] difference really cuz the high priest of
[16:28] our profession you know and so I just
[16:31] asked Joel and his head was bowed and
[16:33] we're talking about somebody out there
[16:35] he's in a denominational Church okay but
[16:38] he knows the Lord as best as God's given
[16:41] him ability to receive and I mean he's
[16:45] had faith that I can't believe it um
[16:48] just stuff and he's been writing books
[16:51] to for the glory of God in his medical
[16:53] practice and he's got this Vision to
[16:55] finish and he's got gos the stories to B
[16:58] CU he was a doctor for over 40 Years
[17:01] anyway he um in the ICU there and I was
[17:06] just talking to him and he was so weak
[17:08] and his chest hurt so bad he was leaned
[17:11] over you know just my big strong brother
[17:13] you know he's just leaning over and I
[17:16] said Joel do you still believe that by
[17:20] his stripes you are healed and Joel as
[17:23] he was leaning over hardly any strength
[17:25] that even stood up and his precious
[17:29] mouth yes I still believe
[17:34] and and when we were up there and I'm te
[17:37] because it's so precious not cuz I'm
[17:39] unbelieving I'm just totally the
[17:41] opposite anyway so um you know we could
[17:46] spent my other dror brother and I were
[17:48] up there for a couple hours and then we
[17:50] went home and we had laid hands on him
[17:52] and prayed for him and Jesus name and um
[17:55] the next morning they were going to do a
[17:57] bronchoscopy just see how the how it was
[18:00] going and the doc oh I forgot to say
[18:03] this there was another incident that
[18:05] happened years ago where um you know God
[18:09] leads us to do stuff and it's because we
[18:12] believe and um years ago I there was a
[18:15] situation where I I needed to pray for
[18:17] somebody and I felt to point to them in
[18:20] jesus' name that that vessel would
[18:23] cauterize in jesus' name the Lord
[18:26] reminded me of that with my brother Joel
[18:29] and I reached forward just nothing big
[18:31] dramatic which I tend to be but I just
[18:34] you know just said I just cauterized
[18:36] those bronchial tubes in jesus' name and
[18:39] that's it and then we left and then the
[18:42] next morning they were going to do the
[18:44] bronchoscopy and the
[18:46] doctor the the people that were checking
[18:48] this they were like
[18:51] uh
[18:53] uh what's going on here there's no more
[18:57] fresh blood going into his
[18:59] [Music]
[19:00] lungs they're actually baffled my
[19:03] sister-in-law she said and she's gone
[19:05] through all this with my brother and she
[19:07] said she said um they're it's an enigma
[19:11] they don't know what happened and so now
[19:14] let's just believe for God to shrink
[19:16] that aneurisms to do you know the
[19:18] testimony that could come out of this
[19:20] everywhere there's people he's been
[19:23] doctor all these years he's got
[19:25] relatives on both sides of the family
[19:27] and all over the place that have have
[19:28] been
[19:30] watching what's been going on with them
[19:32] all these years and he still loves the
[19:35] Lord with all his heart and he said
[19:38] originally he just said you know before
[19:41] I was afflicted I went astray but now I
[19:44] have kept Thy word isn't that something
[19:47] the Lord I'm I'm controlling myself
[19:56] okay amen amen let's put our hands
[19:59] together for Jesus this

[43:01] Shalom and all is well come on brother
[43:09] James there is a
[43:21] place
[43:24] so little
[43:36] his praise the Lord amen song says all
[43:41] all is well amen amen a l l not some but
[43:47] all amen and that's what God wants for
[43:50] our lives I believe in the Bible it's
[43:52] written elij Elijah Elisha went and
[43:55] asked that woman um when when you saw it
[43:58] come uh says is all well with you is all
[44:03] well with your husband and is all well
[44:06] with your child and so showing you that
[44:09] God loves everything to be well with
[44:12] you and everything and anything that's
[44:14] connected to you as well he wants it to
[44:17] be well amen so he knew the husband was
[44:21] a um lukewarm believer that's the one
[44:24] that asked is the service today why you
[44:27] want to go to to the man of God there's
[44:29] no service today he was a a Sunday
[44:33] Christian and he didn't believe you
[44:35] could go to church on Wednesday and but
[44:38] despite that God said is all well with
[44:41] him
[44:45] Hallelujah so just showing you the how
[44:48] God looks at
[44:49] you how God is concerned about his own
[44:53] he's not just concerned about you and
[44:55] you're a Believer and then he's not
[44:56] concerned about your
[44:58] child Auntie
[45:01] Jima right his son was dying and he was
[45:05] dying because of his own um misdeeds and
[45:08] everything else so he deserved in other
[45:10] words he deserved what he was getting he
[45:13] had made his bed and so he was sleeping
[45:15] on
[45:16] it that's what people would say that's
[45:18] what yeah it was his fault right yeah
[45:21] mother despite what mother tried to
[45:23] teach him over the years he was not
[45:25] obedient and so
[45:27] he was he dug his grave or made his bed
[45:31] and he must sleep on it that's what life
[45:35] tell us and everybody would tell us but
[45:37] not in this
[45:38] case the mother said if I could only
[45:41] hear him say he's
[45:44] saved I could only hear him say
[45:48] that and because of
[45:51] that and AD
[45:55] playing and to
[45:58] I mean this flight schedu was
[46:00] disrupted
[46:02] right all those people in the plane that
[46:05] I suppose that appointments and
[46:07] everything else wherever they were going
[46:09] but God says this can take a back seat I
[46:12] have something more important to attend
[46:14] to this
[46:16] morning and all that was based on a
[46:19] backs sing young man disobedient young
[46:22] man but on the other side was a
[46:24] believing mother
[46:28] Glory that's right and that's what God
[46:30] looked at come on and and she she was
[46:34] alone right we didn't hear about the
[46:36] whole church coming together with her
[46:38] was just
[46:39] her I guess everybody else was speaking
[46:42] low tones and saying I suppose that's
[46:45] the end of it all poor girl poor sister
[46:49] poor
[46:50] mother what can you do yeah I I I I
[46:54] thought I always thought she could do
[46:57] things
[46:58] better but here's God looking at her and
[47:02] here's she talking to God sir and here's
[47:05] God answering
[47:06] [Music]
[47:08] her and saying go to the gate I'm
[47:12] sending my Prophet to you and and then
[47:15] he shows his Pi picture because she
[47:18] asked him where's your
[47:22] hat come on says raise your
[47:25] heads well I left at the hotel says I
[47:28] saw you when I saw you you had the Hat
[47:32] on imagine how God wants this thing to
[47:34] be so real to her he's showing it things
[47:37] that oh
[47:39] my I says woman do you know me do you
[47:42] know my name is I said I don't even know
[47:44] your name all I know is I ask God to
[47:48] come and send
[47:50] Elijah for the Salvation of my
[47:53] voice and God showed you showed me your
[47:57] picture and so from 3: in the morning
[48:00] I've been
[48:02] here God hallelujah that was now that
[48:06] was carefully selected by God to be in
[48:08] the spoken word nothing in the is in the
[48:11] Bible by chance and nothing is in the
[48:14] spoken word or in brother braham's
[48:16] experience by chance right everything is
[48:18] carefully selected it's by
[48:21] Design because it's supposed to be
[48:23] delivered to you again and something
[48:25] must happen to you when you read that
[48:27] yes it's connected to you somehow
[48:29] connected to your faith somehow so when
[48:31] you come to the same Junction you'll be
[48:33] able to relate to that and and that
[48:36] becomes oh your experience
[48:39] too Hallelujah so we thankful to God for
[48:42] his grace and mercy tonight this morning
[48:45] so glad we would be here be able to uh
[48:48] have this Junction with you you know
[48:51] these are Junctions in life
[48:53] Journey we we have all those things in
[48:55] our lives so everything that's what the
[48:57] Bible says the footsteps of the
[48:59] righteous are ordered by the LA yes
[49:02] times we we take it casually now the
[49:05] problem with that is the prophet says
[49:06] when you regard the scripture
[49:08] superficially you also get a superficial
[49:10] understanding that's right so if you
[49:12] look at things casually you're also
[49:14] going to get things too but we want to
[49:17] pray that the spirit of wisdom and
[49:18] Revelation would anoint us this morning
[49:21] so we can see things the way God wants
[49:22] us to see them amen so God be with you
[49:26] and God bless you you like to maybe
[49:28] quickly uh say our thanks and
[49:31] appreciation to pastor and for his kind
[49:34] kind hospitality and letting us have his
[49:36] pit this morning and all that goes with
[49:38] it and fellowship with you Saints of
[49:40] Life precious Faith um my name is
[49:43] brother Juma like he say to you Juma
[49:44] being a Muslim name brother James jumer
[49:47] born born
[49:49] [Music]
[49:50] Muslim yeah prise the Lord but
[49:55] God Amen here I am this morning
[49:58] preaching the the unable Riches of Jesus
[50:02] [Music]
[50:04] Christ disowned by my family disowned by
[50:07] my M my dad and mom when are still in
[50:10] high school and made to choose between
[50:12] going to further in my education and and
[50:15] join and and rejoining the Muslim family
[50:17] I said look I I I I've come too
[50:22] far he has given me enough of Heaven in
[50:24] my soul I can't turn
[50:27] back amen and here I am this morning
[50:30] than and and and not only me uh my young
[50:34] brother also followed he's a preacher in
[50:37] the
[50:37] UK then the other one is a deacon in uh
[50:41] in Dubai my sister is also in the faith
[50:44] and my my my father when he passed on he
[50:46] was he was he was believing and so what
[50:49] more can you
[50:53] ask Hallelujah he's worthy of praise
[50:57] Glory and Honor this morning so I
[50:59] believe this morning God has something
[51:00] in store for us so Pastor came out there
[51:02] and he said to me um what's the message
[51:04] title and then I was confused for a
[51:06] moment because when he was when he got
[51:08] out of the room and I started reading
[51:10] some things and looking at some notes
[51:11] and and then I started going some other
[51:13] way and so when he came to ask me what's
[51:16] your meage title for a moment I
[51:18] was but look this morning we're going to
[51:20] talk about the birth path bride's birth
[51:23] path the bride's birth path
[51:27] the thought there being conception was
[51:30] in
[51:31] eternity but but the manifestation is in
[51:34] time conceived in eternity and
[51:37] manifested in time I believe we we know
[51:40] all about that we've read that we we we
[51:42] have an understanding of that but then
[51:44] we want to trust God to give us maybe
[51:47] something that we missed last time or
[51:50] that maybe we must know or maybe that he
[51:53] must add to this other one and that
[51:55] other one because God I was saying to
[51:57] Pastor brother that you see the Bible
[51:59] says Heaven is my throne and the Earth
[52:03] is my food stool so God FS all time and
[52:05] space and now he he takes his mind and
[52:08] compresses it and puts it in the
[52:12] Bible so then if that great God who
[52:15] fills all time and space takes all his
[52:17] mind and compresses it into a small
[52:20] Bible then it
[52:22] means there's more to it than what we
[52:24] see
[52:28] yeah so it means every hyphen every full
[52:31] full stop or pose or comma is is more
[52:35] than we think it
[52:36] is so this thing is
[52:39] compressed that's why he says if you
[52:41] read any Scripture and you don't see
[52:43] Jesus Christ read it again that's right
[52:47] so this book is loaded that's
[52:52] right and guess what it's not only the
[52:55] book
[52:57] but the the ls of the book The the ones
[52:59] that eat the
[53:03] book they they they they're going to a
[53:05] hard drive which is
[53:07] preloaded with computer terms now you
[53:10] you can preload it okay quickly turn
[53:13] with me if we can uh for scripture
[53:17] reading I would like us to read from
[53:19] Matthew Chapter
[53:21] 13 um just a couple of scriptures there
[53:30] so I I just want to ask you
[53:33] to um like brother Braham says put on
[53:36] your spiritual thinking caps um maybe
[53:40] have something to write with because I I
[53:43] tend to just go maybe times just
[53:46] scriptures or just quotations scriptures
[53:49] and quotations and so we might have I'm
[53:53] one of those like brother B says you
[53:54] know he's he's he's got a rambling
[53:56] spirit you can't keep in one place and
[53:58] he goes from place to place um and so
[54:02] times I I could go all over the place
[54:05] but at the back of my mind I'm trying to
[54:08] bring out this fact that the bride must
[54:10] know who she is amen and then the Go's
[54:13] promise is when she knows who she is the
[54:15] rapture will
[54:17] go and I like to us to to understand
[54:20] that we are not here just to to have
[54:22] church uh we we don't this is not
[54:25] regular
[54:27] routine uh brother bam says going to
[54:29] church then home and then work and then
[54:33] church and then home he says that's the
[54:35] regular routine says that's not what it
[54:38] was meant to be no
[54:41] sir God is higher objectives than that
[54:43] for you amen so look at looking at
[54:46] Matthew uh 13 we will read from verse
[54:50] 50 uh 53
[54:57] so we we ought to have a better
[54:59] understanding of what's happening around
[55:01] us than just an election than just uh uh
[55:07] the
[55:08] economy um than just U Israel
[55:13] versus the Palestinians or any we must
[55:17] have a better understanding more more
[55:19] than the everybody's
[55:22] understanding we the bride of Jesus
[55:24] Christ and she has the mind of Christ
[55:28] and she knows what God wants done with
[55:30] the word okay so from verse 53 let's
[55:33] read together I like us to read together
[55:36] like to hear your voices read with me
[55:38] let's go and it came to pass that when
[55:42] Jesus had finished these Parables he
[55:45] departed than 54 and when he was come
[55:50] into his own country he Tau them in
[55:53] their synagogue in so much that they
[55:56] were astonished and said whence is this
[56:00] man this wisdom and this Mighty works so
[56:04] they were perplexed didn't understand so
[56:06] they had a
[56:07] question where where is this man getting
[56:10] this wisdom number one and number two
[56:13] these Mighty works okay
[56:17] 55 is not this the carpenter son is not
[56:23] his mother called Mary and his Brethren
[56:28] James and Justice and Simon and
[56:32] Judas and his sisters are they not all
[56:37] with us whence then has this man all
[56:42] these
[56:44] things and they were offended in him but
[56:49] Jesus said unto them a prophet is not
[56:53] without owner save in his own country
[56:57] and in his own house
[57:01] and many mighty works there because of
[57:05] their
[57:07] unbelief so they they they talk
[57:10] themselves out of Miracles or Mighty
[57:14] Works their
[57:16] attitude
[57:18] there Christ was full of Mighty works
[57:21] but the
[57:24] attitude made them to have none of those
[57:27] or or just a little of those and so we
[57:29] would like to Bow our head and pray and
[57:31] then we read other scripture after we
[57:33] sit let's bow our heads and pray
[57:35] gracious kind loving Heavenly Father how
[57:39] grateful we are this morning to be in
[57:40] divine presence Lord to be among Saints
[57:43] of like Precious Faith the redeemed of
[57:45] the Lord oh God are we as the prophet
[57:49] told us the value of your redeemed that
[57:52] even if you was to have the blood of
[57:53] Jesus at the literal blood in in a
[57:55] picture in a glass and how we'd walk T
[57:59] to Toe with it not wanting it not
[58:02] wanting it to spel Lord but he say
[58:05] because it's precious but he says how
[58:07] much more is the the purchase of that
[58:10] precious blood he says that's even more
[58:12] precious than the blood itself and
[58:14] that's the Bride of Jesus Christ the
[58:16] ones that were bought by that blood we
[58:19] thank you Father that this morning
[58:21] before me is the Bride of Jesus Christ

[59:53] talking about it was a preacher would
[59:56] didn't take long always preach 10 15
[59:58] minutes and and just like clock workor
[1:00:01] but this other day he preached I don't
[1:00:03] know for three hours or something and
[1:00:05] then they they got back to him and asked
[1:00:06] him but what happened
[1:00:08] today didn't he have the sweet because
[1:00:11] it D it in his mouth and then by the
[1:00:12] time it dissolves stops there this time
[1:00:15] lo and behold looked at it was a button
[1:00:18] so it it took long to dissolve it didn't
[1:00:21] even
[1:00:23] dissolve kept on going
[1:00:27] but I suppose if if it comes to that
[1:00:30] there's a purpose for that there's a
[1:00:31] reason for
[1:00:33] that all right while we're while we're
[1:00:35] sitting can we turn to Luke chapter
[1:00:38] 22 um and read from verse I think
[1:00:42] 35 22 and read from verse
[1:00:50] 35
[1:00:51] so I believe you came um under
[1:00:54] expectation
[1:00:56] so see there there's principles and
[1:00:58] there's laws that God God works with and
[1:01:01] one of them is the that law of whatever
[1:01:04] you desire he'll give it to you if you
[1:01:06] seek him you'll find him uh if you draw
[1:01:10] near to him you'll draw near to you if
[1:01:12] you thirst of righteousness you will be
[1:01:14] filled um so God works with laws uh God
[1:01:18] doesn't do things halfhazard uh he's um
[1:01:21] he does things is it uses numbers right
[1:01:26] uh and he uses
[1:01:28] laws um so if you look in Revelation
[1:01:32] chapter 11 it would say there was given
[1:01:36] to me a re like a road and I was asked
[1:01:39] to measure the temple and measure the
[1:01:41] Altar and measure the believer amen so
[1:01:44] three things were measured the temple
[1:01:46] was measured the altar was measured and
[1:01:49] then the worshiper who comes to Worship
[1:01:53] in a measured temple on a measure alar
[1:01:56] has to be measured to
[1:01:59] amen so God is specifics to whatever he
[1:02:02] desires or wants it has to be certain
[1:02:05] design certain color certain height
[1:02:09] certain material certain quality he
[1:02:11] doesn't just take anything no no he says
[1:02:15] God is a spirit and so they that worship
[1:02:19] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[1:02:23] truth you have to know who he is in
[1:02:25] order to give him appropriate worship
[1:02:27] that's
[1:02:28] right Y in other way it won't work you
[1:02:31] have to see how he wants it done and do
[1:02:34] it the right way and then he says well
[1:02:37] done he's okay Malachi chapter one he
[1:02:41] says um the the Earth knows his master
[1:02:45] um children know the the father um
[1:02:48] people know their the governor or
[1:02:51] governor of the state or whatever uh but
[1:02:53] he says Israel doesn't know their God he
[1:02:55] says says if I be a father where is mine
[1:02:59] owner you say this Mal chapter 1 he says
[1:03:03] you you give me for for sacrifice you
[1:03:05] give me
[1:03:06] lame
[1:03:08] sacrifices he says I want to challenge
[1:03:10] you that's the Bible he says you take
[1:03:11] that and give it to your governor and
[1:03:13] see if he'll be happy with
[1:03:14] you yeah that's God he says take that
[1:03:18] lamb thing lamb and and with the my with
[1:03:22] the ribs showing and everything else
[1:03:25] says give that to your governor and see
[1:03:27] if he'll be happy with you says but you
[1:03:30] want that you want me to to be happy
[1:03:31] with that you you want to give me
[1:03:34] anything and everything and call it
[1:03:36] worship and you expect me to be happy
[1:03:38] with
[1:03:40] you when we say we meet on time you come
[1:03:42] in at the time because God to you God is
[1:03:45] an old daughtery
[1:03:47] grandfather who puts up with anything
[1:03:49] and
[1:03:50] everything says no way that's right you
[1:03:54] see so if you have to know who he is
[1:03:57] amen know his nature know his character
[1:04:01] know how he desires you to approach him
[1:04:04] and then tore the line that's right and
[1:04:07] and then he can you find his you find
[1:04:09] him ready to to bless you to to embrace
[1:04:11] you and to give you whatever he's
[1:04:13] promised to give
[1:04:14] you amen praise the Lord hallelujah okay
[1:04:19] we in Luke chapter
[1:04:22] 22 I'm sorry was that a bit of a damper
[1:04:25] was that a bit of
[1:04:30] a that's God's word right prise
[1:04:33] God yeah so so if people will com in and
[1:04:37] and then uh you know Pastor you know
[1:04:39] this month things things just didn't
[1:04:41] work well and I can't pay my tithes you
[1:04:43] know or I can't can only pay part of it
[1:04:45] because you see I to H this thing came
[1:04:48] and um you know it was my only chance to
[1:04:51] do it and you know Pastor I've been
[1:04:54] praying for this thing and on and on and
[1:04:57] on and on and then
[1:05:01] so that's what happened so I'm sorry
[1:05:04] I'll make I'll make out for it next
[1:05:06] month for the other month what can
[1:05:08] Pastor do what can the trustees do but
[1:05:12] what can God do thing is not Pastor he
[1:05:15] the one who gave the Commandment that's
[1:05:16] the
[1:05:18] problem it's like no was AR I told you
[1:05:21] if you start pulling I have a problem I
[1:05:23] like Noah AR
[1:05:29] when when no when the Bible says that
[1:05:31] and when no had completed the act the
[1:05:34] Bible says and God closed the door not
[1:05:38] Noah Noah built the ark but the one who
[1:05:41] closed the door was
[1:05:43] God you why would God close the door and
[1:05:47] not let let Noah do it usted he
[1:05:50] entrusted everything to Noah to get the
[1:05:53] material to to get the the equip and
[1:05:56] everything and to build it and all and
[1:05:57] then at the end of it it taks it from
[1:05:59] nowhere it says I'll have it now thank
[1:06:03] you so thank you for what you've done
[1:06:05] it's now mine and then and then the
[1:06:08] Bible says and God closed the door why
[1:06:10] would God do that says because it's
[1:06:13] judgment time now because friends will
[1:06:16] come to know after judgment is in
[1:06:18] session and say Noah come on man I'm the
[1:06:20] one that helped you that time when
[1:06:22] things were difficult no one else could
[1:06:23] help me I was the only one that
[1:06:26] ra my put my neck on the Block for you
[1:06:28] yeah I'm sure you can vouch for that and
[1:06:32] know as a human
[1:06:33] being would say yes true that's on the
[1:06:36] record I can't deny that so
[1:06:40] no let me
[1:06:43] in one good turn deserves
[1:06:46] another if not now then
[1:06:49] when if not me then
[1:06:52] who come on man and now as a human being
[1:06:55] would be you know tempted to make a
[1:07:00] plan open the door and say Well only one
[1:07:04] this ones only you maybe not your not
[1:07:06] your nephews and everything only
[1:07:08] you but the thing is this was not his
[1:07:11] project that's right it was God's
[1:07:15] project it was this wasn't nothing to do
[1:07:18] with him it was God all the way through
[1:07:21] the Bible says it came to pass that when
[1:07:23] men began to do wickedly then God said
[1:07:25] in his is at the end of All Flesh is
[1:07:26] come yeah so I I'm going to destroy the
[1:07:29] whole world and then okay I've got to
[1:07:31] make a plan for those who will
[1:07:34] believe and then he did that and he
[1:07:36] called Noah to be part of it Noah is not
[1:07:38] the owner of that project and and so God
[1:07:42] says I will close the door amen because
[1:07:45] when God closes no man can open
[1:07:48] amen it's
[1:07:51] done and and so when God gives you a
[1:07:53] commandment even if men want to change
[1:07:56] it they can change it but you have a
[1:07:58] problem with God you still have to
[1:08:01] account to him am so if he gave you
[1:08:04] whatever he gave you he he expects a
[1:08:08] return amen
[1:08:11] amen if he gave you five talents he's
[1:08:15] coming back and ask you to give an
[1:08:18] account for the five
[1:08:19] talents remember the Bible says so he
[1:08:22] says that King was going our away for a
[1:08:23] long time and he called his servants and
[1:08:25] he gave this one five he gave this one
[1:08:27] two he gave this one one and then after
[1:08:30] a long time he came back and he said the
[1:08:33] courau in session and he says what did
[1:08:37] you do with what I gave you and so the
[1:08:40] the first one with five
[1:08:42] says I used it I invested it and I made
[1:08:47] another five out of it now I've got 10
[1:08:50] here you are sir and the King was so
[1:08:52] pleased and said good and faithful
[1:08:54] servant pronounce a blessing on him the
[1:08:57] one with two the same thing but Lord and
[1:09:00] behold he came to the one with with one
[1:09:03] the one with one and he said you sir
[1:09:06] says me
[1:09:09] I here's my
[1:09:12] story after having studied you knowing
[1:09:16] your nature and your
[1:09:18] character that you want to reap where
[1:09:20] you have not
[1:09:22] sown you expect too much from too little
[1:09:26] I decided I didn't want any problems
[1:09:29] with you yeah I didn't want any issues
[1:09:32] so what I did was I took what you gave
[1:09:34] me and I wrapped it
[1:09:39] carefully and put it away where no one
[1:09:42] could touch
[1:09:44] it I mean here's
[1:09:46] your whatever dollars $100 whatever if
[1:09:49] you can check the the serial
[1:09:53] numbers yes original EX exactly what you
[1:09:56] gave me I never swapped it for another
[1:10:00] note in case you say I I used it then I
[1:10:03] brought it back I never did yet is
[1:10:08] original and the master said Wicked thou
[1:10:11] Wicked
[1:10:12] servant you knew exactly who I am and
[1:10:15] what I like and what I don't like why
[1:10:17] didn't you
[1:10:18] then go to the those guys that that that
[1:10:22] uh that pay interest so that after to
[1:10:25] sometime I would have had some interest
[1:10:27] on my
[1:10:28] money but look at this this man never
[1:10:31] even touched that money so he never
[1:10:34] robbed this man he kept it original but
[1:10:38] that was not how the master looked at it
[1:10:41] says when I give you anything I give you
[1:10:43] to multiply
[1:10:45] it
[1:10:48] amen so here here here's the thing when
[1:10:52] God gives you anything he doesn't expect
[1:10:54] you just to keep it
[1:11:02] hello amen if God gives you anything
[1:11:05] that he gives you amen now he he is
[1:11:10] Hebrews 138 same yesterday then forever
[1:11:12] he's a god of
[1:11:14] continuity uh so what there's a keystone
[1:11:16] of the Bible whatever he T to do he has
[1:11:18] to keep on doing it and it's done for
[1:11:20] the last time he he he always adds he
[1:11:24] does not subtract so you learn his
[1:11:26] nature you learn that he does not
[1:11:29] subtract if he gives you anything he
[1:11:31] wants you to multiply it just like it
[1:11:33] did from from Moses right up to this age
[1:11:37] right like it did from Luther to this
[1:11:39] age like now we in the Masterpiece age
[1:11:42] we we in The Headstone age it it didn't
[1:11:45] remain at the foot level he adds and
[1:11:47] adds and adds until he comes to the
[1:11:49] climax amen amen hallelujah so he says
[1:11:53] what is what is a storm the prophet say
[1:11:54] what's a storm it says it's water and
[1:11:56] and wind and rain it says but rain what
[1:11:58] is rain uh it says it's water that God
[1:12:02] created but the devil got into it
[1:12:05] churned it up and W it up and then it
[1:12:07] brings
[1:12:08] destruction he said what about the
[1:12:10] hurricanes and everything else the wind
[1:12:12] is air which God created but then the
[1:12:16] devil got a hold of it and started
[1:12:18] training and then it brings
[1:12:19] destruction God made it's made by God
[1:12:23] but the devil got a hold of it and it
[1:12:25] brings death and destruction so whatever
[1:12:28] God gives you don't let the devil get a
[1:12:30] hold of it he gives you a voice use it
[1:12:33] in his
[1:12:34] service I right you young men because
[1:12:36] you're strong gives you strength use it
[1:12:38] in his
[1:12:39] service so he wants profit from whatever
[1:12:42] he gives you right but when you come to
[1:12:44] the bride type now you come to uh our
[1:12:47] sister the Rebecca in the Bible when
[1:12:49] elazar comes to Rebecca he's got 10
[1:12:52] camel Lords that of of gold and
[1:12:54] everything else right gifts okay is that
[1:12:57] so 10 10 camels and then he says to in
[1:13:01] his prayer he says Lord let it be that
[1:13:03] the girl the damel that I will ask and
[1:13:05] say give me water to drink for
[1:13:09] me then she will give
[1:13:12] me and stop there no no then she will
[1:13:15] also give my
[1:13:18] camels let that be the one and that's
[1:13:21] what happened when he asked her she
[1:13:24] water she gave him water water and then
[1:13:25] she also moved on to give the camels and
[1:13:29] there would how many turn and last time
[1:13:32] I checked a camel drinks 200 L of water
[1:13:34] in 3 minutes oh wow and she did it for
[1:13:38] 10
[1:13:40] Hallelujah she asked to give water to
[1:13:43] him but she also moves into overdrive
[1:13:46] and gives it to the
[1:13:48] camels that's right and the cam just
[1:13:51] doesn't drink a little bit like this it
[1:13:52] drinks a whole drum in 3 minutes
[1:13:56] so you're talking of a bride type here
[1:13:58] that when God asks you of anything if
[1:13:59] you're real real bride you know what he
[1:14:01] really wants from
[1:14:03] you oh my you don't just come right just
[1:14:07] on time no
[1:14:08] sir you don't just come into church just
[1:14:10] on time no sir you do more than that
[1:14:13] Hallelujah your skats are not just on
[1:14:15] time on on on the knees right on the
[1:14:19] just on the borderline no
[1:14:21] sir neither here neither there just no
[1:14:24] sir thank you thank
[1:14:26] you this is your nature the nature of
[1:14:29] the Bride you're not playing on the
[1:14:31] border no sir it's in you to to to
[1:14:35] please your lord it's in you to you
[1:14:37] catch the mind of the spirit and you do
[1:14:40] it amen praise the Lord so they we could
[1:14:44] not be blessed here because they their
[1:14:46] attitude was wrong yes so they they were
[1:14:50] looking at it from natural level they
[1:14:52] said who is this man his father we know
[1:14:56] and it's Joseph he's a
[1:14:59] carpenter his mother Mary never went to
[1:15:01] school as far as we know so we know who
[1:15:04] she is we know a IQ she's never done
[1:15:07] anything extraordinary except that story
[1:15:11] how giving birth without a husband
[1:15:13] that's but that's what we know his
[1:15:16] brothers we know we know them the
[1:15:19] sisters we know them so if you are going
[1:15:21] to um to plot a graphia
[1:15:25] okay you got his father we know his
[1:15:28] sister we know his brothers we know
[1:15:32] his we know so you you join all those
[1:15:35] you got a box right so you got this box
[1:15:39] here his father we know his mom we know
[1:15:40] his brothers we know his sisters then he
[1:15:42] joined the corners there then you got
[1:15:43] the box so Jesus according to you now
[1:15:47] must act within thex the
[1:15:53] box so he must just must be like
[1:15:56] everybody else not
[1:15:59] extraordinary he must fit in that box
[1:16:02] but there's a problem here Jesus was not
[1:16:03] born of of of of of these parents here
[1:16:07] Joseph
[1:16:09] no the
[1:16:11] Lord he was from Heaven
[1:16:15] himself so he could not fit that
[1:16:18] box so they're looking for him in the
[1:16:20] wrong
[1:16:21] place they placed him wrongly so here is
[1:16:24] if youare if you if your diagnosis is
[1:16:27] wrong more than 90 time 99% of the times
[1:16:30] your your prescription will be wrong
[1:16:33] right yeah if you if you go to the
[1:16:36] doctor and the doctor says to you okay
[1:16:38] this wound here this festering wound I
[1:16:40] think it's just an ordinary wound so but
[1:16:42] in the meantime it's cancer right in the
[1:16:45] meantime it's cancer and he says well to
[1:16:47] him is okay he prescribes uh what you
[1:16:51] call
[1:16:52] elastoplast yeah just an order bandage
[1:16:55] that's it that's what ites it and then
[1:16:56] it gives you aspirin or whatever it is
[1:16:59] painkiller and ask you to go
[1:17:03] home it's
[1:17:05] misdiagnosis right so if you if you
[1:17:08] follow that line if you miss if you miss
[1:17:10] out Miss on the
[1:17:11] diagnosis you're going to more than
[1:17:14] likely miss on the prescription yeah
[1:17:17] you're going to bring damage or you're
[1:17:18] going to bring
[1:17:21] death are we are we are we together so
[1:17:23] they miss on the prescription only the
[1:17:25] diagnosis here they thought he was just
[1:17:27] an ordin man but in the meantime he was
[1:17:29] more than a man it was God himself here
[1:17:33] hallelujah so when you look at this this
[1:17:35] bride would be saying she if is is the
[1:17:38] Bride of Jesus Christ that we dealing
[1:17:40] with uh she must understand who she is
[1:17:43] she must understand what it took to
[1:17:45] bring her here she must understand the
[1:17:48] mind of the the one who would begin the
[1:17:52] whole program so that's why we go back
[1:17:55] before
[1:17:56] Genesis you come in Revelation chapter
[1:17:59] 13 and chapter 17 13:8 17:8 it tells you
[1:18:04] the the names the names were in The Book
[1:18:07] of Life when before before the
[1:18:09] foundation and the lamb was slain when
[1:18:13] before the foundation and then Hebrews
[1:18:16] 4:3 will tell you that the works were
[1:18:18] finished before the foundation
[1:18:21] Hallelujah so when you come to the bride
[1:18:23] now she's got this she must get this
[1:18:25] understanding she must be awakened the
[1:18:28] reason why the prophet came the message
[1:18:30] came is to awaken her to who she is
[1:18:33] where she came from what it took for her
[1:18:35] to be what she is that's
[1:18:38] right if you don't know who you are like
[1:18:41] if then the devil will sell your dad
[1:18:46] yeah amen yeah if you don't know who you
[1:18:48] are if you don't know what you have you
[1:18:51] exchange it for nothing remember the boy
[1:18:52] with the stamp we found the oh this
[1:18:55] stamp this this post posted stamp or
[1:18:58] something and then to him it was of it
[1:19:01] was equivalent to what ice cream or
[1:19:03] sweets right and he got these sweets and
[1:19:05] ice cream he was happy with that but
[1:19:08] when this man who bought it took it to
[1:19:09] town he got $5,000 out of it the value
[1:19:13] depends on the one that is holding it
[1:19:17] the one that's observing it so if you
[1:19:19] don't know what you have you underrate
[1:19:22] it or underrate yourself yeah or you
[1:19:27] undervalued amen so here's the here's
[1:19:30] here's Satan coming to Eve and she is
[1:19:33] the answer to Genesis 1:26 and
[1:19:36] 27 let us make men in our own image in
[1:19:39] our own likeness and let them have
[1:19:43] dominion all right so and here comes
[1:19:45] Adam as an answer to Genesis 1 126 and
[1:19:48] 27 a man in God's likeness and image in
[1:19:53] likeness and let them have dominion so
[1:19:56] image and likeness equals Dominion is
[1:19:59] that so let us make men in our own image
[1:20:02] and their own likeness and let them have
[1:20:05] dominion so image and likeness equals
[1:20:08] Dominion right sir so here here they
[1:20:12] come now and they reflection of what was
[1:20:14] in the mind of God for a man the man
[1:20:17] that he wanted and so if when she comes
[1:20:20] she's a part of
[1:20:22] that and and and Satan comes now and
[1:20:24] says yeah has God said now here's
[1:20:27] another thing the devil doesn't tempt
[1:20:29] you on what has not been said his main
[1:20:32] temptation is what you have been given
[1:20:35] yes like after this service you come and
[1:20:39] try and take what you had out of
[1:20:41] you after Jesus had fasted for 40 days
[1:20:44] and 40 nights what was his
[1:20:46] temptation the
[1:20:48] food so you can know which way he's
[1:20:51] going to come from what you have been
[1:20:54] going through through yes see Dev is not
[1:20:57] confused he I mean he's author of
[1:20:59] Science and science deals with physics
[1:21:01] and and and and mechanics and and and
[1:21:04] lws and everything else and definitives
[1:21:07] and Mathematics and everything else so
[1:21:09] he doesn't do things halfhazard he he he
[1:21:11] sizes you up and he measures you up and
[1:21:14] and and so that's why he's uh was the
[1:21:16] first like somebody said the first
[1:21:18] genetic
[1:21:19] engineer he could mix
[1:21:21] jeans you knew any other animal would
[1:21:24] not mix
[1:21:25] their seeds could not mixx with the
[1:21:26] human seed and so he this he knew that
[1:21:29] it was only this
[1:21:31] Beast who whose seed could cross with a
[1:21:34] human seed and produce a
[1:21:38] life so you're not dealing with somebody
[1:21:40] in overnight boy you're dealing with
[1:21:42] somebody who's got more than 6,000
[1:21:43] experiences years of experience that's
[1:21:45] right and and and so that's why when
[1:21:48] when when now God comes and tells you
[1:21:50] don't do this and you play around with
[1:21:52] that the devil is right there next door
[1:21:54] you
[1:21:57] he he's he he knows you more than you
[1:21:59] know yourself yeah that's
[1:22:02] right so we we we want to come to
[1:22:06] something here
[1:22:07] um if you don't understand your age you
[1:22:11] will not understand the message of your
[1:22:14] day if you don't understand the disease
[1:22:17] you will not understand the prescription
[1:22:20] the
[1:22:21] medicine so if you don't understand Le
[1:22:24] you want to understand the message of
[1:22:25] this
[1:22:27] hour then you you you'll be happy with a
[1:22:30] Feelgood message as an answer to this
[1:22:33] age because it's because you don't
[1:22:35] understand this
[1:22:37] age there's many places all over the
[1:22:39] world where they preaching signs and
[1:22:41] miracles is the main thing uh of the
[1:22:45] message but Pentecost did that years ago
[1:22:47] yes that's right that's right we have we
[1:22:51] looking our own country we've had that
[1:22:52] we've had a miracal rival Miracles
[1:22:55] happened know there's a time when you
[1:22:56] couldn't get fuel for your car we we
[1:22:58] couldn't get gas for your you call it
[1:22:59] gas yeah we couldn't get it not diesel
[1:23:02] no no kerosene nothing but yet people
[1:23:05] had to
[1:23:07] travel people had to travel and so what
[1:23:09] did Brothers do gathered around the car
[1:23:11] and say Lord and begin to pray like in
[1:23:13] the book of Acts we have to we have to
[1:23:15] travel amen we have to go fuel or no
[1:23:18] fuel and so what do they do get water
[1:23:20] from the
[1:23:22] tub fill the car
[1:23:25] and close the thing and then lay their
[1:23:27] Bibles on it and pray and
[1:23:31] travel yes sir a lot of things happened
[1:23:34] in that time does didn't our Prophet
[1:23:36] tell us that the church always uh
[1:23:38] prospers under persecution when things
[1:23:40] begin to get hard that's when Saints
[1:23:43] begin you know the Believers really
[1:23:45] start to
[1:23:47] believe we we we we went through all
[1:23:50] that we saw all that but it times you
[1:23:52] know when we have everything like
[1:23:53] brother man says when you have
[1:23:54] everything then Faith takes a back seat
[1:23:56] because everything is
[1:23:58] mechanical become so mechanical but let
[1:24:01] Saints look at this um Here Comes God in
[1:24:04] this last age to give us an
[1:24:07] understanding of what age we we are
[1:24:09] living in and then give us an
[1:24:11] understanding of what it would take to
[1:24:14] be an overcomer in that age because the
[1:24:17] problem the the prophecy is in Genesis
[1:24:19] CH sorry in Revelations chapter 2 and
[1:24:22] chapter 3 remember the church ages
[1:24:25] every age there is a bless there's a
[1:24:28] diagnosis and then there's there's a
[1:24:30] prescription and then then there's the
[1:24:32] the reward for those that overcome in
[1:24:35] every every one of those ages yeah so
[1:24:38] but when you come to our age now let's
[1:24:40] let's turn let's turn to um oh let's
[1:24:44] finish sorry sorry let's finish Luke
[1:24:46] 22 we I want us to read verse from verse
[1:24:50] 35
[1:24:55] okay yes let's go let's read from verse
[1:24:58] 35 could I just
[1:25:02] yes I think we we must move now uh let's
[1:25:06] read together verse
[1:25:07] 35 and he said unto them when I sent you
[1:25:11] without purse and script and shoes let
[1:25:15] you anything and they said nothing they
[1:25:18] didn't like anything right 36 then said
[1:25:22] he unto them but now now he that has a
[1:25:26] purse let him take it and likewise he
[1:25:29] script and he that has no sword let him
[1:25:32] sell His Garment and buy one for I say
[1:25:36] unto you that this that is written must
[1:25:41] yet be accomplished in
[1:25:46] me and now no that second part so he's
[1:25:50] not putting in the part that was written
[1:25:53] about
[1:25:55] which has not yet been okay
[1:25:58] fulfilled and he takes it out of Isaiah
[1:26:03] 53 this part that we reading next are we
[1:26:06] together are we together are we together
[1:26:07] make sure we're together here now it
[1:26:09] says for I say you that
[1:26:11] this this that is written must yet be
[1:26:16] accomplished in me and he reads it now
[1:26:19] and what does he say and he was reckoned
[1:26:22] among the transgressors
[1:26:24] then stops
[1:26:26] there and then he continues with this
[1:26:28] sentence for the things concerning me
[1:26:33] have an end now that end there means
[1:26:37] purpose amen the things concerning Jesus
[1:26:40] the things happening to Jesus the
[1:26:43] experiences that he's going through have
[1:26:46] Arisen that's what that statement says
[1:26:49] but he injected that part of Isaiah 53
[1:26:52] which says uh he was and he was reckoned
[1:26:57] among the
[1:26:59] transgressors he takes it out of Isaiah
[1:27:01] 53 so he says the things concerning me
[1:27:05] have a
[1:27:06] purpose my life is not just an ordinary
[1:27:10] life my life is not just from Pillar To
[1:27:14] Post you know where everything is
[1:27:16] determined by the economy where
[1:27:18] everything is determined by the landlord
[1:27:21] by the boss or by whatever my life is
[1:27:23] beyond is more than that amen Amen
[1:27:27] Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the head of
[1:27:29] the body and whatever happens to the
[1:27:31] Head must also happen to the body oh my
[1:27:35] that's that's where Jesus this morning
[1:27:36] to see this journey that we're in that
[1:27:38] is not just an ordinary journey and so
[1:27:40] our experiences are not ordinary either
[1:27:43] no no sir everything is ordained to us
[1:27:46] and there's a purpose for why we go
[1:27:48] through what we go through yeah somebody
[1:27:50] say Amen to that yes sir did the Bible
[1:27:53] say God will not allow you to be tempted
[1:27:57] yes above what you are able to
[1:28:01] bearen oh my look at that amen we see it
[1:28:05] in job when the devil came to God and
[1:28:07] says and God said to him have you
[1:28:09] considered my servant who job that
[1:28:11] there's none like him and the devil said
[1:28:13] well you see it's because it's because
[1:28:15] it says okay you want to timey say yeah

[1:28:24] then he said okay give me
[1:28:26] extra and God says oh you want to try
[1:28:29] him again he says yeah but add some more

[1:30:46] looks backwards like oh my election
[1:30:48] looks back to it's all election here and
[1:30:51] then God looks at what looks at what he
[1:30:53] elected
[1:30:54] and he's able to bring it why so
[1:30:57] predestinate looks back to for knowledge
[1:30:59] so he saw Abraham in future he saw him
[1:31:02] doing all these things here and he says
[1:31:03] because of what I see I'm going to bless
[1:31:06] him right here oh my

[1:31:51] mountain right so he tells him is where
[1:31:54] he's coming from and where he's going to
[1:31:56] end he the in between doesn't tell
[1:32:01] him uhuh he doesn't tell him about the
[1:32:03] in
[1:32:05] between no he
[1:32:07] doesn't I remember uh last time we met
[1:32:10] with Pastor in in in Petoria he was
[1:32:13] preaching they asked me to say a few
[1:32:15] things that just before he finished the
[1:32:17] services and spoke on Luke 8 and22 where
[1:32:21] Jesus said to the disciples let us go
[1:32:22] over to the other side M yeah and then
[1:32:25] the Bible says and he went to sleep he
[1:32:27] said that statement and then he went to
[1:32:29] the back of the boat and then he fell
[1:32:32] asleep and then the the the disciples uh
[1:32:36] went in the ship and then they started
[1:32:37] the journey and halfway through that's
[1:32:38] when the storms came up and he was
[1:32:42] storms started he was still
[1:32:44] asleep storms increase he was still
[1:32:47] asleep the boat began to shake and
[1:32:50] everything else and he was still
[1:32:52] asleep there was not enough shaking to
[1:32:55] wake him
[1:32:58] up he was not
[1:33:01] moved Lord no sir see why he had already
[1:33:05] spoken it let us go over to the other
[1:33:11] side it was already
[1:33:14] spoken and when God speaks his word he
[1:33:16] believes his word and he acts upon his
[1:33:20] word amen he he he didn't have one eye
[1:33:23] closed and one eye open no to see if he
[1:33:26] was working out no sir he he he had
[1:33:30] already
[1:33:31] budgeted for everything else in the way
[1:33:35] here so to him it was
[1:33:38] done but to these ones here they didn't
[1:33:41] understand how he
[1:33:43] works but he he was he was training
[1:33:46] them and then that's when they got so so
[1:33:49] so fearful you see to them because they
[1:33:52] were in the five senses
[1:33:55] in the
[1:33:56] humanistic and so the human element
[1:33:59] applies fear comes in okay you talk
[1:34:02] about their sight they could see all
[1:34:04] these Billows man you talk about the
[1:34:07] hearing my you could talk about about
[1:34:10] feeling you could talk about taste you
[1:34:12] know when you're in big trouble you know
[1:34:14] your mouth dries up man become
[1:34:18] salty and of course the mind in the five
[1:34:21] the five senses of the spirit start
[1:34:23] operating me M you know all those things
[1:34:25] start operating here and and somebody
[1:34:27] would have thought man if only this
[1:34:29] thing had happened when I was just five
[1:34:31] five five five meters from the shore I
[1:34:34] used to be a champion
[1:34:36] swimmer right I could have swam out of
[1:34:39] this if only it had happened sorry it
[1:34:41] didn't happen that
[1:34:42] way God made sure it was beyond five 5 m
[1:34:47] amen it was at a place where you could
[1:34:50] not swim
[1:34:52] back you anything else people I I should
[1:34:55] have just listened you know you know I I
[1:34:57] didn't want to come there was that voice
[1:35:00] saying to me don't go or there somebody
[1:35:02] invited me the other side you know I
[1:35:04] should have listened to that but God
[1:35:07] knew you were supposed to be here
[1:35:10] yeah you were supposed to be in the boat
[1:35:13] not tomorrow not justest now this time
[1:35:16] right when trouble is in
[1:35:19] s the determinate councel of God God
[1:35:22] determined that would be here nothing
[1:35:25] going wrong in your life but it's God
[1:35:28] working his own will in your life
[1:35:31] bringing you through different Junctions
[1:35:33] so that his glory can be made
[1:35:36] manifest am and so all this all these
[1:35:38] things went through their mind they
[1:35:40] tried as humanly as possible to scoop
[1:35:43] the water out as much as I believe as
[1:35:45] much as they scooped out as much as came
[1:35:47] in it was beyond human effort right see
[1:35:50] the problem was this journey was not
[1:35:52] theirs they went not they were not the
[1:35:54] authors of this program here and that's
[1:35:57] one thing they should have just said
[1:35:59] Brothers stop stop a minute before we
[1:36:02] begin to fall apart whose program is
[1:36:05] this
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:08] anyway who is the designer who is the
[1:36:11] author of this program here amen so wait
[1:36:13] a minute that's Jesus and who's Jesus
[1:36:17] and what has he done what works has he
[1:36:21] done so with what he has done and all
[1:36:24] that he is can we say he didn't know
[1:36:26] about
[1:36:27] this is there anything too difficult for
[1:36:29] him didn't we see him there do other
[1:36:32] things greater than
[1:36:34] this did he not change water into
[1:36:37] wine and who what's water
[1:36:40] anyway amen and and so the the devil was
[1:36:44] telling them oh my fear Was Fear was in
[1:36:46] session it was telling them was
[1:36:48] whispering to them and was blowing oh my
[1:36:49] all the Billows was telling them you you
[1:36:51] you gone you die you'll never make it
[1:36:54] today I'm going to drown you
[1:36:57] today you should never have come out
[1:36:59] here I've got you come on brother and
[1:37:01] and then this all these things they were
[1:37:03] letting these things come in and
[1:37:04] everything else and their faith was
[1:37:05] going lower and lower and lower and
[1:37:09] lower but then the question would
[1:37:11] be the God had say let us go over amen
[1:37:18] and the devil was telling them you're
[1:37:19] going under
[1:37:22] right I'm going to sink you I'm going to
[1:37:24] drown you today they should have asked
[1:37:26] but what did he tell us yeah that's
[1:37:28] right he says we are going
[1:37:31] over not
[1:37:34] and whose voice or whose testimony would
[1:37:37] you rather
[1:37:40] believe the the one the the Creator or
[1:37:43] the
[1:37:45] creation the Creator says we are going
[1:37:49] over and the creation is saying you're
[1:37:51] going under so the question is whose
[1:37:54] testimony will you
[1:37:56] believe are you a Believer then whose
[1:37:59] testimony will you believe oh my whether
[1:38:02] the economy sinks or doesn't sink oh my
[1:38:06] like the prophet says sink or
[1:38:08] drown oh my see that word just one word
[1:38:14] from him created the heavens and the
[1:38:16] Earth he said let there be and there was
[1:38:19] and today the witness of it is still
[1:38:21] there with us that word that is there
[1:38:24] let there be it's kept the heavens up
[1:38:26] there it's kept the Earth down here now

[1:38:39] every need that's the same word that
[1:38:42] kept the heavens up there that keep so
[1:38:45] every time you wake up and can look to
[1:38:47] the sky and see there every time you can
[1:38:50] stand your feet on the earth and see the
[1:38:52] the Earth is still here here it
[1:38:54] testifies to the power of that
[1:38:56] word and that's the same word that
[1:38:59] you're hearing
[1:39:01] today oh
[1:39:03] my Peter says we have not believed the
[1:39:05] kind words or devices of women's fables
[1:39:08] and anything else but it's a pure
[1:39:11] word that's what you're holding on to
[1:39:14] see when Peter said discovered this he
[1:39:16] says Lord ask me to come say I want to
[1:39:19] walk on water he says he says beid me
[1:39:23] come beat me come and the next thing he
[1:39:27] started to walk Christ said come so
[1:39:31] Peter did not walk on water
[1:39:35] per he walked on the word
[1:39:38] hallelujah I mean he if he wanted to
[1:39:40] walk on water he could have tried it
[1:39:42] before but he so he couldn't do it and
[1:39:44] then he says but there's something that
[1:39:46] I can use here the word says Beed me
[1:39:50] come speak the word and my daughter will
[1:39:52] be healed a speak the word and I can
[1:39:55] walk here if you walk on the word you
[1:39:57] will not
[1:39:59] [Applause]
[1:40:00] sink because heavens and earth will pass
[1:40:02] away but God's word will never pass
[1:40:06] away oh my my my my you see there's an
[1:40:10] overriding power here overriding Factor
[1:40:13] it overrides the
[1:40:14] natural when you start believing okay if
[1:40:18] you take God's laws uh if you start
[1:40:20] working with the laws of God it's
[1:40:22] suspend spend it supersedes natural laws
[1:40:27] that's
[1:40:27] right yes sir that's why when you prayed
[1:40:30] for you must believe that the word is
[1:40:34] God and it will never fail and then it's
[1:40:37] going to come to pass so regardless of
[1:40:40] the symptoms you hold on to the word
[1:40:44] these are different
[1:40:47] dimensions so when you in the Old
[1:40:50] Testament if you killed somebody
[1:40:51] inadvertently made a mistake and you had
[1:40:53] a hole that we using and it was this
[1:40:55] thing came loose and then it struck some
[1:40:58] somebody and they died it was not
[1:41:00] intentional so God made a provision for
[1:41:03] that for Cities of Refuge yeah so you'd
[1:41:05] have to run you'd identify First the
[1:41:07] nearest City of Refuge and then run to
[1:41:11] that place if you identified and don't
[1:41:13] run they catch you they kill
[1:41:15] you if you identified and you run to it
[1:41:18] you must explain your case to the elders
[1:41:20] at the gate and then they see the
[1:41:22] marriage they'll let you in amen and th
[1:41:25] the the Avengers of Blood come up they
[1:41:28] and they try to get you they said no sir
[1:41:31] you can't amen God has made a provision
[1:41:33] for
[1:41:34] you then you have to stay inside that
[1:41:37] City that's right uhhuh you to stay
[1:41:40] until a certain
[1:41:41] time but if you got too smart or too
[1:41:44] excited and and then get out there and
[1:41:48] want to to like the din was it Diana
[1:41:51] this the daughter of uh
[1:41:53] brother who and Jacob went outside to
[1:41:56] check out the the others daughters and
[1:41:59] see how
[1:42:00] the you die yes you see when you are out
[1:42:04] here the law applies an eye for an eye
[1:42:09] but once you cross the border here and
[1:42:11] come into the City of Refuge then that
[1:42:14] law is
[1:42:16] suspended are are we are we getting this
[1:42:19] yeah brother says talk about talk say
[1:42:22] see this who talks about uh talks about
[1:42:26] drinking and everything is about
[1:42:27] drinking he says before you know it he
[1:42:29] falls into that category you talk about
[1:42:32] drinking you love drinking you read
[1:42:34] drinking about stuff like drinking he
[1:42:35] says you fall into that place say take a
[1:42:39] man who talk to vulgarity and he thinks
[1:42:41] vulgarity and then before you know it
[1:42:43] that Spirit catches up on you so if
[1:42:46] you're talking faith if you're beli in
[1:42:48] the
[1:42:49] word that's another dimension it super
[1:42:52] seeds
[1:42:53] the
[1:42:54] natural amen ohow yes sir so when when
[1:42:58] you look at yourself as the Bride of
[1:43:01] Jesus Christ you must understand it's
[1:43:03] not a question of I chose to the
[1:43:08] message I I believe the message it's
[1:43:11] more than that that's right my uncle my
[1:43:14] dad my mom they explained to me this
[1:43:16] message and then I accepted it and now
[1:43:19] I'm here good but you must go beyond
[1:43:21] that bless you must go beyond
[1:43:24] that this God is not in the business of
[1:43:27] trying things just see if they work no
[1:43:29] no no the works were finished before the
[1:43:31] foundation of the
[1:43:32] world so I'm saying January to December
[1:43:36] okay this is what November now you
[1:43:39] October okay thank you I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:43:41] I'm too fast I'm one month ah yet now
[1:43:44] God has been speaking to us service
[1:43:47] after service pastors I think I thought
[1:43:50] I heard him announced that you had
[1:43:51] brother Elijah last weekend then you had
[1:43:54] somebody else on Wednesday and so I can
[1:43:57] imagine before that your brother Dan
[1:43:59] from Zim and other places other people
[1:44:00] coming every one of them bringing a
[1:44:03] message every one of them being a
[1:44:05] conjugate or God using them to to help
[1:44:08] his bride here now this God is not in
[1:44:10] the business of just sending preachers
[1:44:13] there must be a reason why he's giving
[1:44:15] you those
[1:44:17] messages must be a reason why the man of
[1:44:19] God is laboring among you and I want to
[1:44:21] teach on this and I want to teaching
[1:44:23] that and I want to do this there there's
[1:44:25] a reason and there's a God is
[1:44:27] measuring your
[1:44:29] faith so because when your faith comes
[1:44:31] to a certain Junction then things happen
[1:44:35] amen uh paragraph Okay page one of uh
[1:44:40] this sorry I'm just I'm going
[1:44:43] on I haven't I this just coming in so
[1:44:46] it's not on my notes but this is page
[1:44:49] one of spiritual food and Jew season he
[1:44:50] says I want us all to accumulate
[1:44:54] all that you have seen all that you've
[1:44:55] done all that You' have seen and all
[1:44:57] that's been done he uses the word
[1:45:00] accumulate so I I I I believe we're
[1:45:04] World taught church and we have had
[1:45:07] different preachers come and and then
[1:45:09] the the the question would be um what is
[1:45:14] God wanting of us at this juncture what
[1:45:17] does he want us to understand by
[1:45:20] now so when I yesterday we said Genesis
[1:45:25] 12 God calls Abraham come out of your
[1:45:27] Kindred Nation come and follow me
[1:45:31] chapter 13 uh lot departs from him and
[1:45:34] then he he lifts up his eyes and God
[1:45:37] says whatever you see I've given it to
[1:45:39] youuh then chapter 15 The Covenant is
[1:45:42] confirmed and then chapter 17 God says
[1:45:45] to him I am the almighty God walk before
[1:45:49] me and be thou perfect amen hallelujah
[1:45:53] he never asked for perfection in chapter
[1:45:55] 12 no chapter 13 14 15 16
[1:45:58] 14 was the the the battle the great
[1:46:02] battle right then MEC meets him chapter
[1:46:05] 13 is asked to count the the dust of the
[1:46:09] of the sin so shall your SE be chapter
[1:46:11] 14 is is the communion chapter 15 is as
[1:46:15] to come the the
[1:46:17] stars but he never asked him for
[1:46:20] Perfection until chapter 17
[1:46:25] so this is God dealing with you and me
[1:46:28] amen there there's places there's times
[1:46:30] where he doesn't he silent but then this
[1:46:33] comes a time where he wants to
[1:46:35] understand what you understand by what
[1:46:38] he is given you how he he has been
[1:46:42] talking to you the messages he been
[1:46:44] giving you he wants to know what have
[1:46:46] you done with them amen what is your
[1:46:49] understanding with all that God has been
[1:46:51] doing to you amen messages has been
[1:46:53] giving you the experiences that you've
[1:46:55] been going through he he wants an answer
[1:46:58] from you or an acknowledgement from you
[1:47:01] or that you
[1:47:04] understand what has been done yes amen
[1:47:06] that's right amen so it says uh page one
[1:47:10] that's page one of spiritual food and
[1:47:12] Juice season and I want to get built up
[1:47:15] now in the this holy Oracles of God in
[1:47:20] the faith the faith of this hour
[1:47:24] Mark that part the faith of this hour
[1:47:27] yes the faith of this hour not any other
[1:47:31] hour right yes all right the faith then
[1:47:36] it stops it's going to take more faith
[1:47:39] than ever was in any
[1:47:42] age you mark that too yes for this has
[1:47:45] to be rapturing Faith to be taken up
[1:47:50] amen and so because of that we we want
[1:47:53] you to believe
[1:47:55] tonight in all that we have
[1:47:59] seen
[1:48:01] heard the word that you have heard
[1:48:04] preached the signs and wonders that you
[1:48:07] have seen
[1:48:09] done we want you to
[1:48:11] accumulate all that together in your
[1:48:16] heart and consider it whether it if that
[1:48:21] be God or
[1:48:26] not so what they've been hearing what
[1:48:29] they've been
[1:48:31] seeing is not supposed to to go to
[1:48:36] waste the fish and the bread that has
[1:48:38] been
[1:48:39] broken to feed the
[1:48:43] bride The
[1:48:44] Leftovers must not be thrown away but
[1:48:48] rather they must be gathered together
[1:48:50] yeah and stored amen for reference
[1:48:55] amen this is not ordinary bread and they
[1:48:57] should not let it go to waste yeah amen
[1:49:00] this are not ordinary fish they must let
[1:49:02] it go to waste that's right God said no
[1:49:05] you don't you don't throw away that
[1:49:08] that's that that's that's Miracle yeah
[1:49:10] it was five BNS remember and two fish
[1:49:13] and and he multiplied
[1:49:15] it you see and you see how it came about
[1:49:18] they said no go let the children go let
[1:49:21] them people go and buy in the in the The
[1:49:22] Village because time is late now Pastor
[1:49:25] cut the seron time is late there's no
[1:49:27] shops around here they have to go far to
[1:49:29] buy and he said they need not
[1:49:33] depart you read your Bible he says they
[1:49:35] need not depart so what do we
[1:49:40] do I don't brother I don't understand
[1:49:43] Pastor I'm trying to tell him you see
[1:49:46] he's not even seeing outside that the
[1:49:47] it's dark now and these people here are
[1:49:49] hungry mothers with children and
[1:49:51] everything else and tell him to cut his
[1:49:53] message close the service so that the
[1:49:56] people can go and buy and Jesus saying
[1:50:00] they need not depart so what do we do
[1:50:03] then he says to them you give them to
[1:50:07] eat we we don't have anything that's why
[1:50:10] we saying close the
[1:50:13] service it says okay what do you have
[1:50:16] him says we don't have anything he says
[1:50:20] check around says the only thing that
[1:50:22] you could find was five BS and two fish
[1:50:25] the lunch of a small boy remember say
[1:50:29] was not the ordinary loaves because
[1:50:31] there's no way a small boy can eat Five
[1:50:32] Loaves unless he's been
[1:50:38] smoking the wrong stuff if this right so
[1:50:43] he he say say those five bands I don't
[1:50:46] know what you call them here West
[1:50:48] Africa m whatever you call them and it
[1:50:52] says he said they say to them they said
[1:50:54] what is this among so
[1:50:59] many that's the scripture he says what
[1:51:01] are these among so
[1:51:05] many oh brother did you hear that
[1:51:07] brother amen what are these this is not
[1:51:10] sufficient this is nothing to to write
[1:51:12] home about we can't even start to talk
[1:51:14] about anything there's nothing
[1:51:18] here but brother cut the cut out the
[1:51:20] drama let's just go he says give them to
[1:51:23] me amen oh you bring them to me now
[1:51:28] there was about 5,000 men not counting
[1:51:32] women and children statistics will help
[1:51:34] you know that it's more if it's 5,000
[1:51:37] men then you must have maybe 7,000 women
[1:51:40] and and and it's extra children more
[1:51:42] than men normally so if you're talking
[1:51:44] 5,000 men then women would be maybe
[1:51:47] 5,000 or 7,000 you're talking of over
[1:51:49] 10,000 people yes and he says make them
[1:51:52] sit
[1:51:53] yeah then he get the five BNS and the
[1:51:55] two fish and the Bible says he looked up
[1:51:58] and gave thanks he didn't look at
[1:52:01] them he didn't fix his eyes on the bands
[1:52:03] and the
[1:52:04] fish but he looked up amen and began to
[1:52:07] give thanks see looking at them would
[1:52:10] not change them looking at your problem
[1:52:12] won't change it yes but looking up to
[1:52:14] him we can change things will do
[1:52:17] something for you that's right and he
[1:52:19] began to break it and he began to give
[1:52:20] them and so they were he was he was
[1:52:22] breaking it and giving and then they
[1:52:23] receive and they give and they receive
[1:52:25] and you see this scripture would say
[1:52:27] give and it will be given to you but the
[1:52:29] moment you do this there no need for you
[1:52:32] to be
[1:52:33] given the moment you think well I see
[1:52:36] the way the the food is coming it's not
[1:52:38] as fast as it was maybe there's a
[1:52:41] problem the supply
[1:52:44] chain when this when the when the when
[1:52:47] the squirels begin to come
[1:52:51] slower and it's getting dark and then
[1:52:53] the prophet says I think I've got enough
[1:52:55] I think I'm going away he comes back and
[1:52:57] says are you now
[1:53:01] doubting you've already spoken it yeah
[1:53:05] right that woman who was told what you
[1:53:07] have in your house they've come to take
[1:53:09] the boys my boys away but my husband was
[1:53:11] your servant and he says what do you
[1:53:13] have in your
[1:53:16] house Oh my he says what first what do I
[1:53:19] do what can I do for you then before she
[1:53:21] answers what do you have in your house
[1:53:24] yes now just shows God how much he wants
[1:53:27] to help you yes and he says now go he
[1:53:30] says we have a little oil says that's
[1:53:32] enough we can start from there yeah amen
[1:53:35] a little says that's enough he says now
[1:53:38] go borrow empty vessels that's right of
[1:53:41] how many neighbors all your neighbors oh
[1:53:45] my wait a minute wait a minute Prophet
[1:53:48] maybe I didn't make myself clear I just
[1:53:50] have a little oil
[1:53:52] yes I know prescription is God borrow
[1:53:56] empty vessels from all your neighbors
[1:54:01] amen all your neighbors not some of your
[1:54:03] neighbors not your closest all your
[1:54:06] neighbors that's right then when you
[1:54:09] have them go close the door start
[1:54:11] pouring oh
[1:54:14] my is she must believe the prophet now
[1:54:17] she must believe you see maybe didn't
[1:54:20] but he's a prophet
[1:54:22] what do I have to
[1:54:24] lose you know he's a man of God that's a
[1:54:28] prescription why sit we here and
[1:54:31] die so she must believe this and then
[1:54:34] she starts pouring the oil suppose she
[1:54:36] does it in the first and five and the
[1:54:37] number 10 drum and then the other one
[1:54:40] the oil starts
[1:54:43] stuttering drips and stops and and oh I
[1:54:47] knew it I knew it not
[1:54:51] last but the question was would
[1:54:54] be this was this is this little but how
[1:54:57] come the first vessel got filled yes how
[1:55:00] come the second one God through and now
[1:55:02] you're doubting
[1:55:03] here and then you you look in to see if
[1:55:06] there still oil I mean to beginning with
[1:55:08] there was not enough in yes that's right
[1:55:11] so why should you even look
[1:55:13] here that's right if you started to walk
[1:55:15] on that level keep on that level there
[1:55:18] from Faith to Faith to Faith to Faith
[1:55:21] and watch the Miracles and fold
[1:55:23] hallelujah amen so God has carried you
[1:55:26] his word he has given you message after
[1:55:28] message after message you want not to
[1:55:30] accumulate all that and start to see
[1:55:32] what God has been
[1:55:34] saying oh my what has he been saying to
[1:55:37] me over this this whole year last year
[1:55:40] and this year this month last month
[1:55:43] that's right what is this expectation of
[1:55:46] my faith and understanding amen but the
[1:55:49] bride must mature she must understand
[1:55:51] it's not a mle just you know like they
[1:55:53] say in in business there they say we can
[1:55:55] have a lot of H activities in the in the
[1:55:57] business people people running up and
[1:55:59] down and and driving in driving the
[1:56:01] drawing the resources and everything
[1:56:02] else but the the owner of the business
[1:56:04] is is not just worried about the
[1:56:06] activity he wants to see what the bottom
[1:56:08] line is yes after you've done everything
[1:56:11] that you've done at come end of the
[1:56:13] month or or the first quarter they want
[1:56:14] to see how much have we
[1:56:16] made because you are in business to make
[1:56:18] money yes so they ask what what is the
[1:56:21] bottom line
[1:56:22] so after having church after having
[1:56:25] service after service the whole year the
[1:56:26] whole whatever month God Is Watching and
[1:56:30] seeing how much faith has come into the
[1:56:35] church we we we mustn't have one
[1:56:37] testimony in one
[1:56:39] year it must be every
[1:56:44] day God's power to transform must be
[1:56:47] transforming hearts and
[1:56:49] lives Sinners must be saved amen oh my
[1:56:53] the the the the Cen statue must be
[1:56:57] revived the sick must get
[1:56:59] healed Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:57:02] today and
[1:57:04] forever Mir Miracles is is just God's
[1:57:08] power that he's using you see and it's
[1:57:12] unlimited one place brother says you you
[1:57:15] should have he says You must keep the
[1:57:16] devil on the Run keep him on the
[1:57:19] run but but if you have your this is if
[1:57:22] you have a vision correct that's what
[1:57:23] must happen but today the other way
[1:57:25] around it's it's like we are victims
[1:57:27] we've got the victim mentality we we
[1:57:30] just made it by the grace of God you
[1:57:32] know the devil the devil the devil the
[1:57:34] devil we become more of the Devil's
[1:57:37] Advocate and yet he's supposed to be
[1:57:39] under your
[1:57:41] feet amen amen you see you see you came
[1:57:45] from God's mind I was I was going to
[1:57:47] read quotation here from U I think from
[1:57:52] one of the messages he says God God's
[1:57:55] thoughts he always had his thoughts and
[1:57:57] you were a part of his thought right
[1:58:00] yeah so then when God thought of you and
[1:58:02] spoke that was that was he says you'll
[1:58:04] never do that again because you went out
[1:58:06] of his mind then now you became
[1:58:09] expressed amen he says you you are not
[1:58:12] like it's not like a man who has a a
[1:58:14] design that he has blueprint which he
[1:58:17] says after I get some money or I I I I
[1:58:20] win the lot to I will I will build this
[1:58:24] he says he might never win the lotto and
[1:58:26] so that design or that blueprint will
[1:58:28] stay on the
[1:58:29] shelf he he thought of that right and so
[1:58:32] he put it on paper right and then now
[1:58:35] it's it's Gathering dust on the
[1:58:37] Shelf because it was not a part of him
[1:58:40] that's right says but the bride is the
[1:58:43] opposite she's a literal part of
[1:58:47] him without her he is not complete
[1:58:52] just think about that now that's right
[1:58:55] he can't do without you that's in the
[1:58:57] message who do you say this is he can't
[1:58:59] do without you you a part of him I think
[1:59:01] I'll read this a couple ones then we we
[1:59:03] we we close um but I want us to to
[1:59:07] challenge us
[1:59:08] on what do you say or who do you say
[1:59:12] this is what has God been doing with you
[1:59:14] is he true is he alive is he real to you
[1:59:18] is he working on your case working on
[1:59:20] your life
[1:59:23] is he keeping his promise to
[1:59:27] you is he really directing your
[1:59:31] footsteps that's right is he really
[1:59:33] concerned about everything that concerns
[1:59:36] you I know he said you will even the
[1:59:39] hairs of your head are
[1:59:41] numbered not counted right
[1:59:45] numbered so he knows number
[1:59:47] 56 number
[1:59:50] 2003 that is part of it is hanging on
[1:59:53] your comb the blower blew part of it
[1:59:57] away that's how much you knows about
[2:00:01] your hair
[2:00:03] amen he knows the one that's turning a
[2:00:05] bit gray and a bit
[2:00:08] white you know you knows what's remained
[2:00:10] the B
[2:00:12] shop he know they it by number
[2:00:16] right amen and then Psalms 139 would
[2:00:20] tell you from verse one you have tried
[2:00:22] me and you know me right my words before
[2:00:25] I even speak them you know
[2:00:27] them if I to take the wings of the
[2:00:29] morning and go out there you know where
[2:00:31] I am if I to make my bed in hell you
[2:00:34] know me says he says such knowledge is
[2:00:38] too wonderful for me if he knows you
[2:00:41] that much will he then forget about you
[2:00:46] today because the economy things are not
[2:00:48] working
[2:00:50] right because Russia is doing this and
[2:00:52] Japan is or this other way is doing
[2:00:54] this he says you are the apple of my
[2:00:59] eye oh
[2:01:01] my so when we look at that we we see we
[2:01:05] our then our approach should
[2:01:07] change okay I I I have the sorry brother
[2:01:11] I don't know if you can pick this up for
[2:01:13] me
[2:01:16] um he says you you you you no longer

[2:01:37] um
[2:01:39] ohy
[2:01:43] 66 paragraph 66 just notice how few
[2:01:47] recognize him to be the anointed word of
[2:01:48] that day God in the beginning being
[2:01:50] infinite know all things from the
[2:01:54] beginning and the only thing that the
[2:01:56] these things are is the display of his
[2:01:59] attributes remember we were talking
[2:02:01] about conceived in eternity and
[2:02:04] manifested in time those attributes so
[2:02:07] an attribute you have an attribute it's
[2:02:09] your thought you think of something then
[2:02:11] you speak it then you take it that's God
[2:02:15] he in the beginning if you now listen to
[2:02:18] this if you ever was or ever will be in
[2:02:22] heaven Hallelujah if he ever was or ever
[2:02:27] will be Amen in heaven you were in
[2:02:30] heaven to start
[2:02:33] with
[2:02:35] Hallelujah I came from God and I go back
[2:02:38] to
[2:02:38] God Amen and I passed through time we on
[2:02:43] a journey that started from the mind of
[2:02:46] God and now we in time we're going back
[2:02:48] to God
[2:02:49] again I'm going back to way I came from
[2:02:53] right going back to my father's house
[2:02:54] like the prodal son he did not start
[2:02:56] from the from the from the pig St he
[2:02:58] says I will rise that's Resurrection
[2:03:01] right and go back to my father
[2:03:04] reconciliation and when you got back to
[2:03:06] Father father was always watching out
[2:03:07] for him oh my it's like Steven when he
[2:03:11] went up there he says what did you see
[2:03:13] Heaven open yes and Jesus
[2:03:17] sorry standing not
[2:03:20] sitting standing to receive
[2:03:24] him he says here comes one of my own
[2:03:27] here comes a Victor I can't stand I
[2:03:29] can't sit I have to
[2:03:32] stand oh my when you think of what God
[2:03:34] we make God
[2:03:36] stand now look at
[2:03:38] this God so loved the world that he if
[2:03:43] you want to see how much he loved the
[2:03:45] world watch what he gave yes you get
[2:03:48] that if you want to see how much God
[2:03:50] values you what he gave or what he did
[2:03:54] to bring you
[2:03:56] in your true value is it how he values
[2:04:02] you one place he says God must have
[2:04:04] loved Israel this is the king uh is itam
[2:04:06] or something who helped Solomon to build
[2:04:08] the temple he says when Solomon gave him
[2:04:10] this brief and told him this story my
[2:04:12] father designed this and my father
[2:04:14] desired this but God stopped him he says
[2:04:15] I want to do it and I'm determined to
[2:04:17] build a great house for a great God you
[2:04:22] you hear that yeah a great house for a
[2:04:24] great God you have to know who he is in
[2:04:26] order to worship him the way he
[2:04:29] is and says and King when the king
[2:04:31] looked at that he said no this is
[2:04:33] beautiful he says you know what it means
[2:04:35] God must have loved Israel for him to
[2:04:39] give them a king like
[2:04:41] you oh my if God loves the people watch
[2:04:45] what he will give them as pastors or
[2:04:47] Elders because they guide you they help
[2:04:49] you but if he doesn't love you he gives
[2:04:51] you anything
[2:04:53] yes that's why he refused for some he
[2:04:55] didn't want soul to be their King says
[2:04:58] this guy will take this will take this
[2:05:00] would take make your give them a list of
[2:05:02] what he was going to do but they still
[2:05:04] maintained we want him all the
[2:05:06] same now when God loves the people watch
[2:05:09] what he gives them what word he sends to
[2:05:11] them what messages he gives them amen oh
[2:05:14] my just check your times what others are
[2:05:16] getting you might be surprised God loves
[2:05:19] you so much he gives you his word more
[2:05:21] of the word and more of the word and
[2:05:23] more of the
[2:05:24] word so look at that he

[2:06:55] was in the beginning by himself God
[2:06:58] dwelt Alone with his thoughts you'll
[2:07:00] never do that again because his thoughts
[2:07:03] are now being made
[2:07:05] manifest and that's why we are right
[2:07:07] here this day it's God fellowshipping
[2:07:10] with his thoughts which are being made
[2:07:14] manifest oh
[2:07:16] man so he doesn't just see you as a
[2:07:19] number he just doesn't see you as a
[2:07:21] black man white men whatever it is as a
[2:07:23] group as a church no sir he looks at you
[2:07:25] and he sees his thoughts made

[2:07:49] never leave you then he'll go with you
[2:07:51] to end no I don't believe he brought me
[2:07:55] this far to leave me amen if he called
[2:07:58] you then he'll go with you Hallelujah

[2:13:08] day you you can't make them do anything
[2:13:11] outside of
[2:13:13] thatall because of where they came from
[2:13:16] because of who they are manifested
[2:13:19] attributes they can only speak of where
[2:13:20] they came from their DNA speaks of God
[2:13:25] himself amen you did you know the
[2:13:27] prophet says to you science always
[2:13:29] follows the word opening yeah right
[2:13:32] Luther when he found the you can go on
[2:13:34] the horse that time here was Luther
[2:13:37] right he was the hor when the horses
[2:13:40] were were the mode of
[2:13:42] Transport justification was the
[2:13:44] message when when you added and be came
[2:13:48] the the the motorc car he was Wesley too
[2:13:51] in England right yeah is that so yeah
[2:13:55] then then after that what happened then
[2:13:58] then there was the the right Brothers
[2:14:00] the airplane right and then what happens
[2:14:03] on the spiritual side amen
[2:14:05] Pentecost prise God okay the first one
[2:14:07] and the second one were Earthbound but
[2:14:09] the third one was up in the air
[2:14:12] justification and sanctification amen
[2:14:15] was out here but the third one was
[2:14:17] Pentecost speaking tongues and spiritual
[2:14:20] things right right all going parallel is
[2:14:22] that so Matthew 13 let them let them go
[2:14:25] grow to together all right then after
[2:14:28] that what happened after the right
[2:14:30] Brothers after the airplane what did we
[2:14:33] get astronaut and on this side after
[2:14:36] Pentecost what we have the message of
[2:14:38] this hour
[2:14:39] here hallelujah going where beyond the
[2:14:43] Aeroplane is that so and that's why in
[2:14:46] the in in the Bible here when Elijah
[2:14:49] would go away in the rapture he was
[2:14:51] going around with who with Elisha right
[2:14:54] and then it went from place to place
[2:14:56] before the extraction point and then
[2:14:58] there was a place where Elisha now
[2:15:00] Elijah is now with Elisha and is about
[2:15:02] to be raptured and the Bible says and 50
[2:15:05] of the sons of the Prophet stood a far
[2:15:08] [Music]
[2:15:10] off before the Rapture there must be a
[2:15:13] clear distinction here between Pentecost
[2:15:16] and the message 50 means Pentecost and
[2:15:20] 50 of the s of the Prophet stood are far
[2:15:22] off just before the Rapture here so
[2:15:25] there must be an Awakening between them
[2:15:27] and the Rapture of a people must be
[2:15:29] awakened to who they are to what they've
[2:15:32] been given and then the faith that must
[2:15:34] be released from that Faith from that
[2:15:36] from from that
[2:15:37] message oh my
[2:15:41] Hallelujah you see if you're looking at
[2:15:44] the the first and the second and the
[2:15:45] third the pilot of the airplane the
[2:15:47] driver of the car and even the hor Rider
[2:15:50] they have three things in common they
[2:15:52] can eat the same food there no there's
[2:15:54] no special requirement the pilot can eat
[2:15:57] whatever food you eat and still fly the
[2:15:59] plane and then they they dress the any
[2:16:01] way the same way too there there's no
[2:16:04] special requirement and they can have
[2:16:05] shoes and walk the same way special
[2:16:07] requirement no special requirement but
[2:16:09] when you pass that when you go to the
[2:16:11] fourth one Everything
[2:16:15] Changes the diet
[2:16:18] changes the work changes
[2:16:21] Everything Changes brother they have a
[2:16:23] space walk not an ordinary walk special
[2:16:25] food everything is changed when you come
[2:16:29] to the fourth one and that's this age
[2:16:31] everything has to change our attitude
[2:16:33] has to change the way we worship has to
[2:16:34] change we have to know who he is how to
[2:16:36] worship him everything else changes
[2:16:39] that's why even the titles of those
[2:16:40] messages tell you who God is tell you
[2:16:43] how his his relationship is with you and
[2:16:46] how he wants you to worship him how he
[2:16:48] wants you to relate to each other oh my
[2:16:51] everything there a there was a okay when
[2:16:53] when we look at the the horse ride the
[2:16:55] airplane to the to the spacecraft this
[2:16:58] this a Quantum shift here yes okay there
[2:17:02] is a Quantum shift things get there must
[2:17:05] be different yes if you get a
[2:17:08] revelation Prophet says if you get a
[2:17:10] true spiritual revelation of God and of
[2:17:14] the two Spirits operating within the
[2:17:16] framework of the Christian church he
[2:17:19] says you will be invincible God that's
[2:17:21] right you've been immune
[2:17:24] church God you will never be the same
[2:17:27] again God there will be no ordinary
[2:17:29] service that you can ever attend right
[2:17:32] here never be an ordinary Church day and
[2:17:35] there will be no ordinary Sunday right
[2:17:37] because God makes everything new and
[2:17:39] makes everything special amen when you
[2:17:42] know that when God wakes you up in the
[2:17:44] morning it's not an ordinary day it's a
[2:17:47] special day because he wants to do
[2:17:49] special things with you
[2:17:51] because you are special in his sight you

[2:20:05] he's not dying and they change their
[2:20:07] attitude they say no he's a god this one

[2:20:11] wizard see this man was under
[2:20:15] assignment amen God had said I've raised
[2:20:18] you for a reason I've raised for a
[2:20:21] purpose oh my when I think of this and I
[2:20:23] go back to Genesis and God is creating
[2:20:25] the mountains and everything else and
[2:20:27] what you know what he does in Genesis
[2:20:28] chapter one he puts a prophet's face on
[2:20:31] the mountain right that's right right
[2:20:34] here in America yes so God is creating
[2:20:37] mountains in Tibet and creating
[2:20:38] mountains in Canada in America in
[2:20:40] whatever in Africa and in Australia all
[2:20:43] those mountains is
[2:20:44] creating and then it zeros in right on
[2:20:48] America that's right it zeros in on a
[2:20:50] certain place yes and he puts a face
[2:20:53] that's right of a man called William
[2:20:55] Bram
[2:20:56] yes in
[2:20:59] Genesis chapter
[2:21:01] one and then not only that he goes on to
[2:21:04] the seven mountain peaks of montal lier
[2:21:08] right and he put seven mountain peaks
[2:21:12] speaking about his message standing in
[2:21:14] the Gap you read
[2:21:16] that in Genesis
[2:21:21] that's right preparing the arrival of
[2:21:23] the
[2:21:26] attributes amen oh my and then it's not
[2:21:30] only him right you know that under that
[2:21:33] messenger is me names yeah you know
[2:21:38] first SE says you hear the plan of it
[2:21:39] the messenger catches that there's an
[2:21:41] announcement in heav catches the mystery
[2:21:42] starts preaching it there's a temporary
[2:21:44] judgment on then there's the Believers
[2:21:46] who believe it they're sealed under his
[2:21:48] message so when he's put that face in
[2:21:51] that mountain guess what is in his mind
[2:21:54] amen there must be a people to believe
[2:21:56] that message a people that are ordained
[2:21:58] with him there amen so when you the
[2:22:02] arrival of the Manifest of the
[2:22:06] attributes God has them in his mind here
[2:22:08] so when he's creating he's got them in
[2:22:11] there yes amen oh I hope somebody sees
[2:22:14] this we're closing now amen when he is
[2:22:18] creating the world okay we go back God
[2:22:22] when God wanted to create the mountains
[2:22:25] okay or or the rivers or sh fish rather
[2:22:27] brother says what does he say tell us he
[2:22:29] had to have water right for the fish to
[2:22:32] swim
[2:22:34] inen for for the trees here to Heaven
[2:22:37] Earth for the trees to be planted and
[2:22:39] grow in it doesn't do things the other
[2:22:42] way around it doesn't doesn't work
[2:22:43] hophazardly so he he makes a
[2:22:47] preparation for whatever is going to
[2:22:49] come amen so he made a preparation for
[2:22:52] those attributes oh my did brother say
[2:22:54] he made mountains because he knew I like
[2:22:57] mountains he made Rivers because he knew
[2:23:00] I like to
[2:23:02] fish what are we talking about the
[2:23:04] mystery of a pre-planned life right
[2:23:06] that's what he says in things that are
[2:23:07] to be yeah that's right he says your
[2:23:10] life down here was pre-planned
[2:23:12] God knew what you liked oh my yes he
[2:23:16] designed that that that that City for
[2:23:19] you
[2:23:21] oh come on
[2:23:23] now you you're not just a happen stance
[2:23:27] you did not just happen to be in this
[2:23:28] age but it was God who designed that you
[2:23:31] be here in this last
[2:23:32] age so here you you must come there's
[2:23:35] the first the one that came first in the
[2:23:37] first age and God says that's fine he
[2:23:39] says what about these ones God said no
[2:23:42] these ones are special they are not for
[2:23:44] the first age they are not for the
[2:23:45] second age they are not for the third
[2:23:47] age these are designed for the last
[2:23:52] age and the last age is where he himself
[2:23:56] Revelation 3:14 introduces himself as
[2:23:59] the god of the
[2:24:01] amen amen he says I am the amen that's
[2:24:05] what he says in Revelation 3:4 and the
[2:24:07] prophet tells us whatever introduction
[2:24:09] he makes has everything to do with what
[2:24:12] he's going to do in that age and he says
[2:24:15] amen stands for
[2:24:17] finality stands for prevailing Pro
[2:24:20] promise oh my so in this age there is no
[2:24:24] promise that can just go like that every
[2:24:28] promise has to come to pass am it say a
[2:24:32] prevailing promise Hallelujah he's
[2:24:35] appearing to us as the
[2:24:38] amen the god of finality and I want to
[2:24:42] say anything that was in the pending
[2:24:43] tray amen has to move from the pending
[2:24:46] tray everything must be finalized
[2:24:50] your issues must be finalized your case
[2:24:53] must be finalized I don't care what it
[2:24:55] is when you know who he is you must
[2:24:57] approach him the way he
[2:24:59] is
[2:25:01] amen nothing pending about you that's
[2:25:04] right it has to be finalized if not now
[2:25:06] then when if not me then who oh my I'm
[2:25:10] just an
[2:25:11] attribute oh my and and and I'm must
[2:25:14] reflect where I came from there's a
[2:25:16] purpose for me to be here that's right
[2:25:18] Hallelujah and God put in inside you
[2:25:21] everything that you need to go through
[2:25:23] time and come back into eternity amen
[2:25:27] and that's why you come to church to to
[2:25:28] to be uh awakened to that reality so
[2:25:33] every message you check in every message
[2:25:35] you find there's a pit of it there bit
[2:25:36] of it day and that brother spoke about
[2:25:38] this that and you put them together you
[2:25:40] you accumulate amen all this here oh my
[2:25:43] in why Christ speak says and all this
[2:25:45] draws a picture for us it's not just
[2:25:48] stories that's why those Tripes and the
[2:25:51] Shadows is is all to for you to by the
[2:25:54] spirit of God to draw a picture see
[2:25:57] yourself before time in time and after
[2:25:59] time see your yourself identification I
[2:26:02] don't know how many time the preach that
[2:26:04] you must see yourself in the word right
[2:26:06] you must see yourself in the scripture
[2:26:09] you must see a part of yourself there
[2:26:11] that because this is The Book of
[2:26:13] Life hallelujah amen every life is in
[2:26:17] there and and so when when it's being
[2:26:20] opened by the spirit of God you see
[2:26:22] yourself there right like that like
[2:26:23] little boy who from the countryside who
[2:26:25] never seen a mirror come come to to
[2:26:29] Auntie's house and she he runs across
[2:26:31] there and he see somebody's running
[2:26:32] across then he stops and says but what's
[2:26:34] that he does this and he does this but
[2:26:36] this there's a boy there was doing the
[2:26:37] same thing I'm
[2:26:38] doing something came to him says that's
[2:26:41] you that's right says mom come see
[2:26:43] something he says what is it he says
[2:26:45] come see this it comes says what is it
[2:26:47] says mom look at that says that's me
[2:26:49] there if I do this that one does that if
[2:26:52] I do this that that's the same thing
[2:26:53] with us here today we see ourselves in
[2:26:56] aunti Jima we see ourselves in Peter we
[2:26:58] see ourselves in Esther oh
[2:27:02] my his attributes being made manifest in
[2:27:05] time in Esa you get the the the
[2:27:07] conception is she doesn't understand
[2:27:09] what is happening the real problem she
[2:27:10] says but what what's happening to my
[2:27:12] uncle says your uncle is behav funny and
[2:27:14] strange he's moved from wherever he was
[2:27:16] he's now at the gate he's now put on
[2:27:18] sackcloth and everything else oh my he's
[2:27:20] looking filthy and everything oh says oh
[2:27:22] take this go give him so he gets this C
[2:27:25] she get and then going try and give it
[2:27:26] to him and he says what are you doing
[2:27:28] what's what's this song say Esther sent
[2:27:30] this to you what says she doesn't
[2:27:32] understand tell her I'm not after
[2:27:34] clothes this is more than clothes this
[2:27:36] is The Superficial what you're talking
[2:27:38] about then they went back and they said
[2:27:41] he refused he says this is not the time
[2:27:44] this is not the case so what is the
[2:27:46] problem and then the Bible says when she
[2:27:47] asked what and how what is happening
[2:27:50] here then you see she was upgrading her
[2:27:54] understanding of the time and the
[2:27:57] season and the requirement and then she
[2:28:00] was told the whole story and then when
[2:28:03] it was given to her to to Modi Modi M
[2:28:06] said go tell her she must be prepared to
[2:28:11] pray
[2:28:13] intercede when they told Esther she said
[2:28:15] no I can't I'll
[2:28:18] die and then the Final Answer came again
[2:28:22] if you think you are going to
[2:28:25] escape God will raise deliverance from
[2:28:28] another Angel because he will always
[2:28:30] deliver his children that's right with
[2:28:32] you with or without you yes God will
[2:28:35] keep his word so when she understood
[2:28:38] that then that's when she walked into
[2:28:40] moved into that cycle again come to a
[2:28:42] place where she said I understand I have
[2:28:45] to step up be being a Jew I must
[2:28:47] recognize who I am must recognize I was
[2:28:49] put here for a reason I must recognize
[2:28:51] that God is depending on me to live that
[2:28:54] life out so they say all my maidens were
[2:28:58] going to fast now she recognized the
[2:29:00] importance of those people around you
[2:29:02] was not just maidens to minister to her
[2:29:04] and then give a good life no they were
[2:29:06] here for prayer prayer warriors they
[2:29:08] were here to fight the battle with her
[2:29:10] oh my those people that are around you
[2:29:12] they're just not your church brothers
[2:29:13] and Church Sisters these are attributes
[2:29:16] that came from the same mind of God and
[2:29:19] then there's a an element in this one
[2:29:20] that you don't have and that's why you
[2:29:22] need them and when this one comes
[2:29:23] together great things begin to happen
[2:29:26] here Saints out of the whole Bible you
[2:29:29] can see the manifestation of those
[2:29:30] attributes because they come from God
[2:29:33] they bride cannot persecute bride yeah
[2:29:35] that's right you cannot you cannot be
[2:29:38] anything outside of the word that's
[2:29:39] right God bless you it's 130 God be with
[2:29:42] you

[2:32:52] had no relative there was there was not
[2:32:54] another person no party going on no no
[2:32:58] distraction nothing it was just Adam and
[2:33:01] Eve and all that was given to them was

[2:33:52] responsibility to keep his word he
[2:33:55] commit his word to
[2:34:00] us Jesus said man shall not live by
[2:34:03] bread alone but by every word that comes
[2:34:06] from God's
[2:34:08] mouth what a responsibility
[2:34:14] amen may God help us may he give us
[2:34:17] Grace and I can say the the Lord is
