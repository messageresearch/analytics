and praise God shall we be seated for a moment musicians God bless you for setting the pace I don't have the best of voices tonight but I'm trusting God to see us true praise God um whatever you are trusting God for just believe God wants to honor himself in the lives of his children there but accept you give God room you would never see it manifest just make room for God make room for him and let God come in God bless you Sister I've been asking of you good to see you yes make room for God and let God come in and see God work in your life praise be to God there was a part of the story brother Joshua left out last week and um when he was giving his testimony and I just want to pick just that and then we'll move on he went to a hospital asking them to do to evaluate him for the surgical operation and this hospital here I examined him and told him he was not qualified for it because his vision was just too bad so he goes to work and somebody at work tells him about um laser surgery then he started praying about it and then he had a dream if I get it wrong you correct me he had a dream and in a dream was it a man who told you you would see a voice a voice taught him in the dream that you are going to see again are you going to see or you're going to see again I want to say that my left eye came open but for some reason my right eye was still closed and I noticed in the dream it took a little a little bit longer but it had opened and as soon as I did that I woke up and it was right after I had prayed about the next procedure or evaluation I was going to and then praise be to God Amen good so now he leaves this hospital here which says he was not qualified and he goes to this Hospital and they tell him you you qualify and then on the day of the surgery he goes to the hospital that says he's qualified and for some reason they say you know what before we do the surgical oppression you have to go to this hospital here which says you are not qualified and they have to consent to it before we do it it doesn't make sense does it but then he goes and the same people that said you didn't qualify they said oh you qualify praise be to God then these people had to do the surgery what I'm trying to bring us to is that never underestimate what prayer can do that's right never never never underestimate what your prayer can do it's okay to ask for prayers it's okay because the Bible makes us to understand one which is a thousand and two will chase ten thousand I thought I was good at math until I saw this praise be to God two would bet if for any reason you have to fight it out and sort it out on your own do not let your faith waver praise be to God when you go on your knees it doesn't matter what is on your knees it doesn't matter whether what you're on your back it doesn't matter whether you are behind the steering wheel just let it be you guys remember of the story I told you when I was behind my truck and that thing was coming again yes I didn't have to go on my knees behind the steering wheel I just sat down it was not even I wouldn't I just said oh Father do not father have mercy I mean don't just I need your help please father just don't let this I just I just spoke I wouldn't call that a prayer and it was it was just over praise be to God so I'm just using it to set the tone tonight we are going to look at something I have not forgotten that we've not read our scripture yet I have not started but I'm very mindful of our time tonight I don't know how much time I'm gonna I'm gonna get um it's nothing much it's just a I mean um just a little lesson here I want us to look at which I have titled getting away with everything getting away with everything and at work probably three months or a little under three months I changed my department I used to be in Syria I have moved to baking stroke meals stroke pets and we froze some items actually it was meat that was ground and we froze it and we were splitting it and I had a butcher's knife very big and long and I was using it to split the the meat and it was icy so it slipped and one is slipped in fact it's just been a miracle when it slipped the easiest place the knife was supposed to go was right here because I had his hand on it and the knife went this way and when it went I've had knife cuts and machete Cuts plenty times okay you will feel the instrument going through you and you throw the knife away but this time I finished cutting myself before I realized I had done it that was how fast it was so if the knife had come anywhere here I would have cut through before even realizing it and I took these two fingers script went into the nails and actually if you looked at it it was like a piece of my finger was gone it was so vivid that when the First Responders came they tried to stop the blood it wouldn't stop and the surgeon have lost the finger I said nope so they went there to look for it that was how bad it was and it was a test day the following day I wasn't supposed to go to work I had taken it off so I didn't go to work so the Monday I went to work and the people were surprised I came to work I'm fine except we heard about you I said yes this is it he said no this was not what we had I said but this was what happened they said you cut your cut yourself I said yes this is it and honestly I didn't think the fingernails were going to grow back might have grown back so the same week I was sitting down and one of the First Responders he is um the the the shift lead for the first shift and then he was sitting with his colleagues and I was sitting down doing something on the computer what happened to you last week I said I cut my fingers and the other guy said yeah it was really really bad and he has the biggest stitches I said no and the first responder who came and saw what happened and was not looking at my fingers healed just in less than one week and he says something he said if you have God in your life the way Donnelly does you can literally get away with anything on that [Applause] praise be to God and I sat down and the whole place was quiet and from there on the conversation changed praise be to God that you can get away with anything and I'm here to tell us that you can get away with everything yeah not with anything but with everything praise be to God and it's funny yesterday I was just sitting behind my computer getting ready for this it was it's been a busy week I have just been going left and right I was just sitting in the process of his friend that that they don't call me here very soon they found my way they were calling me I never had time to look at anything we are just trusting God anyway and another person comes he was trying to discredit somebody on the job I said no it is not true and he said you sit down behind your computer all day writing sermons and they come here and they look at here they don't say anything and you got away with it and because of that you think you are telling lies and he again says I'm getting away with something so I started wondering it looks like I'm getting away with too many things praise God it's interesting shall we stand for the reading of the word shall we turn our Bibles to Romans 8. thank you Romans 8 I'm reading from 23. ah sorry sorry let's take Romans 6 first Romans 6 23. Romans 6 23 and I read for the wages of sin is death by the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen praise be to God now let's go to eight one eight one that is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who work not after the flesh but after the spirit may the Lord add His blessings to the religion of his word in Jesus name amen shall we be seated as I said this is a little teaching and I'm just trusting God to minister to us getting away with everything the first scripture we read is saying that the wages of sin is death now we all know what wages are if you are working you earn wages it's something you work for you put Time and Labor into it and then you are rewarded so sin will put time and effort into it and the reward you get is there the wedges of sin is death now let us look at death we all know what death is and I believe that when the Bible says the wages of sin is death and it's not the type of death we know it is not the physical death because it's appointed unto man wants to die says that everything that has a beginning has an end so it doesn't matter whether it's a sinner or a righteous person what I say just all the unjust we all come to the end of that road and we can look behind us and we can tell of our loved ones that have lived for God in all honesty they have done their work they are finished with their Duty and God has called them home if that is the death the Bible is talking about then where does The Sinner come in praise be to God so it is not Jesus one time told his disciples that our friend Lazarus is asleep let's go that we will wake him up but they didn't understand that language and when he realized that they did not understand that language then he spoke in a language they understood and he said he is dead he is dead praise be to God the Bible says in Psalm 116 Psalm 116 verse 15. you can note it down the Bible says that precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his sins precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his sins we are not talking about Sinners here but do not forget the Bible says the wages of sin is death so what type of sin are we talking about here we will get there in a minute for a Believer or a child of God There Is No Death for a child of God we just fall asleep because it's like going to bed at night you fall asleep guess what because there is a morning coming when you are going to wake up so for a child of God There Is No Death in our vocabulary we just fall asleep and we can visit a few places because when Saul went to the witch of endo and asked him asked her to call Samuel when someone came back someone said why have that disquieted me he was having rest when a man stays on Earth are over when the purpose of which God has brought you into this life is over when you have accomplished the task God just takes you home to just go and rest from all the labor from all the headaches from all the disappointments from all the struggles from all the trials the persecutions God just takes you home to go and rest now whichever way you look at death brother Randolph said that means separation separation whether it is physical death or spiritual death it causes what separation when we take physical death when somebody physically crosses over to the other side that person is separated from the rest of humanity and we should get to the spiritual aspect in a few minutes praise be to God now so someone said why have that disquieted me and now you realize there was a question that was once asked I believe it was Joshua asked me that question and um I I I answered him and later came back again um because I realized there were things I left out now we know that when a man dies that is the end of it and how come the witch of endo was able to call back some more not just any person but a prophet of God that a witch was able to call him said that the Old Testament sins under the blood of bulls and goats even though they died Justified they died believing they were the sons and daughters of God believers people that walked before God and demonstrated the power of God in every way possible they could still not get to the presence of God there was a holding area A Place Called Paradise where these Souls went to awaiting the perfect sacrifice said in that Realm it was easy under the blood of bulls and goats for their spirits to be called back but when the Lord Jesus Christ died the Bible says he took captivity captive he emptied Paradise and under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ there is no power right that can go in there and bring out the soul and then nothing the spirit of a man or a woman right nothing it is just not possible and you hear people that go into Superior spiritism um I know I have been a Catholic before and they talk about the six or seven books of what and what and what I don't know why we got we ever got that from and they use that to call spirits and they will tell you oh um we just call the spirit of Peter a demon showed up a demon showed up but not Peter and Brad says some way that if a man dies and they are able to call that person's Spirit back it means that that Soul was not saved that means that Soul was not safe it could also happen as I just mentioned about Peter that we know where Peter is no evil spirit can call him back but whenever they go and they are burning their candles and they are chanting something shows up and they say that it's Peter it could also happen that a child of God will depart this Earth and they will call that person's spirit and something will show up and not that person it's possible but if that person shows up that means that's so was not saved praise be to God as I said it's a teaching a little teaching and I've titled it getting away with everything praise be to God now physical death it's just something that if Christ carries all of us will go in the way of the flesh but there is another aspect which is spiritual death and that is a dangerous one there is nothing good about this a man can be living and yet spiritually that man is dead spiritual death is when you when you now the Bible says that there is hope for the living there is hope for the living you can be separated from God but if you are alive there is hope for you what causes the suppression is sin so so long as you are alive even though you are separated from God by sin but there is hope for you why because that blood that was shed is still speaking is when you come to the end of your road and you don't repent and you die in your sin then you are eternally separated from God brother Bradham said that the way a tree leaves that is why it falls so if you live in sin and you end it you end up dying in sin don't expect that some miracle can just happen no it doesn't work that way that's why the Bible says that work out your salvation with fear don't take things for granted we are living in an era where sin has so much been trumpeted so it doesn't look sinful anymore and people think it's okay every day every day examine yourself every single day examine yourself if there is any area in your life you have to plead the blood keep leading the blood right do not let the sun set on it and when you go before God don't speak grammar he sees you the way you are in the inside what is there to hide you go to the hospital because you are sick anything they tell you to do you do it because you want to get well and sometimes it's like they are invading your privacy but you are sick they need to get to the root cause of it and why do you go before God and you want to sugarcoat things just go to him the Way You Are your heart's opened praise be to God praise be to God so there is another day if you come your life yet you are dead and sin is such a dangerous thing never underestimate sin and what sin can do in a man's life God does not associate himself with sin he loves sinners but he hates sin so if there is sin in your life you think God hates you it's because he has nothing that is in you it's not you and if God is going to condemn sin and sin is in you that means God has to condemn you God hates the very sight of sin the verse appear the very sight of evil right can you imagine the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross he never committed anything but he became sin on the cross bearing our sins and he created my God my God why have that forsaken me why because at that moment he was just hanging there as Sin now God did not even want to associate with it that is how dangerous sin can be praise be to God if there is sin in your life you better destroy it or it will destroy you shut up don't keep fighting that demon we are home for the Holy Spirit If Heaven for evil spirits as a matter of fact they shouldn't even feel comfortable coming around you let alone live in you there is so much power in the word of God to transform in a life praise be to God in the garden God told Adam and if the day you eat of this free you will surely die now we all know the story how they add the fruit and indeed they surely died I know we have looked at a physical side a lot a day unto God is thousand years to man and no man has ever lived above Thousand Years so yes the very day the age of that food that very day they died in the sight of God but there is a spiritual side I want us to also look at because sin causes separation the wages of sin is death sin causes suppression that for God to reconcile with man and innocent lamb had to die so God would have Fellowship with man and we can look at Old Testament Church that that was the order that was established that men go out of the will of God and then they have to come with an animal confess their sins on the animal the animal doesn't have to have any blemish the animal dies in their place so they would live so they will have that relationship with God but that was not perfect because it was the blood of bulls and goats it forgave them their sins but that desire was still there that they went right back to it that's right praise the Lord getting away with everything a lot of the times now a lot of the times we put the horse I mean the cat before the horse David said and iniquity am I shaping and his sin did my mother conceive me so your very conception was out of the perfect will of God your very conception before you were ever born you were a sinner to begin with you didn't have to commit any evil to become a sinner you were born a sinner the reason why people do the things they do they cheat they lie they fight they commit adultery commit fornication they steal they kill is because of sin now a lot of the times we look at it the other way around we said because this guy murdered he's a sinner oh it is because he's a sinner that's why he made it this person is not even right so he's a sinner no is because a person is a sinner that is why they are not living right yeah and brother says that sin is unbelief so if somebody has not believed they will do anything they will do anything and you know I can't say this enough it's a good thing reading your Bible remember that the devil still knows the scripture it's a good thing coming to church praise be to God but before you ever show up the devil is already here he has never missed a church service you have to enter into the inner courts of God and have a true relationship with God that is what differentiates you from just being a religious person I have something just for being around my mind what is that praise be to God the letter caliph by the spirit Giver of Life don't be satisfied with your religion never stop at a religion brother Brown says Cain was religious religion is man-made it's not what God has done it's what you have done right yeah and what you can do God is not your religion praise be to God the letter caliph by the spirit giveth life get into the spirit fist with God have a true relationship with God now when you take the Bible you can feel something going on you don't read the word of God that you're reading newspaper you sit down you feed on the word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God you are feeding on the word of God and you know you can just get so hooked up just one scripture and you never get over it that is why there is a true relationship there is a communion going on between you and God praise be to God we need to get there don't accept anything less you are responsible for what you do with the word of God you are not responsible for what someone else's someone else does is just you do we have to pray for one another yes do we have to intercede for one another yes everything that affects you affects me anything that affects me affects you we are a body of Christ but remember that it boils down to you and to you and God Alone praise be to God so dear a lot of the times we turn the table the other way around so if men had to commit evil to become a sinner the Bible wouldn't say that in sin did my mother conceive me you were already one before you came so everything you were doing until Christ got a hold of you you are doing it because that was the nature of the the Fallen soul you couldn't help it and no man and it's sometimes funny you talk to people and they will tell you I have this going on I have that going on I have to stop before I come who told you you could stop if you can stop before coming they don't even come at all right if you can do it on your own it that people say God helps us who help themselves who told you that if you can help yourself you don't need the help of God God helps those who cannot help themselves that you come to a place you know you are needy praise be to God you know you can't help this situation you just leave it to God you let God take over and see God work my mind was just going round and round and round was it Monday I believe it was not yesterday so that was Monday and I was just thinking of what God has done for Joshua and I I said it just came and I said so all the bad buttons is what was doing he was not seeing [Music] and then I thought just came to me so if you are seeing they're driving worse wait thank God for his grace I thank God for his grace that he can come and leave songs tonight praise be to God her brother brother brother lawyer you guys will wait tell the staff of my lawyer to come and they'll jump through the window and they are gone praise be to God it comes to that point in a man's life when God has taken a hold of that Soul there is nothing you can do anymore you just have to sail with God just have to step in as small as me as much as God gives you Grace and just go with the flow it's amazing what God can do with the life of man if you can only submit yourself submit your will just turn the steering wheel over to God and be a passenger can you imagine you are traveling a road you have never traveled on before and God is sitting in the passenger seat you want to be The Driver praise be to God yeah so it's one of those things yeah now our evil ways did not make us sinners and for that matter our good works would never make us righteous if it took works to become a sinner it will take weeks to become righteous but we became sinners by representation and our righteousness would have to be by representation whether you do good or evil it's an indication of the condition of your soul praise be to God what am I bringing us through the Bible says good works are as filthy rights in the sight of God it will not carry you any voice have that in mind as we go on faith without works is dead good words are good but without faith they are useless our faith is by faith our righteousness is by faith in Christ Jesus in some way a lot of in a lot a lot of places where brother said show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works praise be to God so wax have their place you can't say you have faith when there are no words back in it but works do not profit on their own right now God sees faith but no man sees faith when there is Faith in here God looks down there and he knows that his faith but I can't see you a brother or a sister and I tell all that is straight in here I don't know that but by your works I can tell whether there is Faith here or not so the effect you have is going to produce a life that is why the Bible says by their works you shall know them telling you the condition of the soul of the person by their works we shall know them so faith it's a good thing but it must produce life there is no way you can justify it when the life that the life that is supposed to accompany it is absent getting away with everything talks about you look at a baby or maybe a little child or children and you see how innocent they are and sometimes oh you love to have been in that condition because they are innocent that a man that is born of God when you are cleansed by the blood the brother was said for you and I when you are cleansed by that blood you are more innocent than the baby when I first heard this my antennas just came up I said what I never thought of it that way that when you are Washed by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ you are not as innocent as the baby no you are more innocent um my innocent that is how powerful the blood of our Redemption is getting away with everything getting away with everything I have Mary Magdalene here I want to skip that um I would also yes so you just have to he died for us but you have to accept the pardon we can talk about that man who was going to be hanged I mean The Gallows um he was given a partner he refused it um we can skip that but you have to accept the pattern for it to be effective if you don't accept it it doesn't mean anything to you for it to mean something to you you have to accept the pardon now once I was looking at it something came to me about a dream that Daniel Curry had that great evangelists who won a lot of souls to God and in his wordless imagination he probably thought everything was right with him like we sometimes do either out of arrogance or maybe out of ignorance ah something things just sometimes sleep under the carpet and it's not always all right and that in the dream he saw that he came before The Throne of God and he touched by the time he was going to get to the gates the gates were going to open wide open and he was just walking and they will heal him that was not how the story went he got there so who are you so I'm that great evangelist um what's your name you don't know me I'm Daniel Curry who won a lot of souls Christ sister we've never had a few we don't know you but I think let's open the book and check so I can't see your name they say no I ought to be there check it again no I didn't find your name sir say you know what just go and appeal for your peace and when he appeared Before the Throne of God the slightest things the smallest things the days he never regarded where the very things that just got before him and he saw that no and when God started asking him questions he was as guilty as hell all he could do was plead the blood all he could do was plead the blood he saw that he was just good for nothing but for hell all he could do yes Father it is true I told a lie here I did I plead the blood and then he had that voice that sweet voice The Voice we keep hearing every single day trying to direct our paths and we turn it down here and there he hears The Voice father he stood for me while he was on f i stand for him praise be to God all the sins other iniquities that were in his way had to give way because Christ had stood in for him never classify sin sometimes we classify sin we look at the beginning is and we are quick to repent of them but we look at certain things oh this is just too small oh this is nothing oh this doesn't mean anything it means something the way the big things appear before God that is the same way the smartest appear before him and the sight of God Sin is Sin there is no big sin and there is no small sin I have told you guys how I love famine and back home we used to use machetes hoes and hosts a lot and sometimes you are waiting with a machete and the big trees that are in your way you cut them down because you are not out of your mouth you just walk into it no you will cut it down as you're going through and sometimes you see a small stick that is just hanging a brush small very tiny that is just hanging I know you get so close to it you just put it aside instead of cutting it down you aside and then you are waiting and then you forget of yourself you come back there guess what it ends up poking your eyes they're very smart is you overlook you're underestimate the danger they can do they are the very things that would end up being a stumbling block in your way maybe Daniel Curry he may have seen those things but so this is just too small what does this mean and we are you not we we we we do that now we're classify sin is sin and sin ought to be treated like sin sir never take things for granted in the last few days I have used that word countless number of times never take things for granted praise be to God I don't know why never take things for granted under the blood your sins are not seen by the father as a matter of fact in the sight of God they don't exist he was wounded for our transgression so he was bruised for our iniquities your sins no matter how dangerous they are your iniquities no matter how terrible the way the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ forgives you of them all there is no sin that is too big that he cannot forgive as a matter of God As a matter of fact underestimate testing power of God when you come to a place to think that this sin is too big for him to forgive limited the power of God there is no sin there is no iniquity that is properly confessed under the blood that would ever come after you and hunt you anymore we are humans your mind will go down memory lane and with God picking filthy things from the dairy laundry and the devil is good at it just to mess your day up she will never forget of but God looks down and he doesn't see it because it's under the blood God doesn't see it that the devil goes before God every day every moment at every opportunity this is what he has done this one he has done again this is what he has done again this is what he has done again and God looks down and everything is under the blood and the father says I don't see anything the Lord can't you see what he has done I don't see anything getting away with everything with some getting away with everything you ever did wrong every sin you ever committed every iniquity you ever committed since you knew were right and you couldn't do them this you knew were wrong and you went ahead and did them [Music] that under the blood when they are confessed under the blood praise be to God the blood who washes you and you are as clean as clean as the as clean as will get there I know order the blood every sin Is Forgiven it's like dropping dropping dropping ah close no matter how dirty it is you drop it in a bleach it takes everything out of it and when God looks down upon you a son or daughter of God he is looking at you through the blood screen of the Lord Jesus Christ the blood it's a bumper the blood of Christ was shed for us it doesn't matter what condition you find yourself in there is hope for the living if there is any sin if there is any iniquity if there is anything you have to confess confess it under the blood let the blood of Christ that was shed for us take complete control and in the sight of God you never did it to begin with a lot of the times we beat ourselves up we can wait until we get headaches and and God looks at us and he wonders what is going on your sins are forgiven what are you beating yourself about and that is why the devil gets us that a time we have to use just to praise God and to enjoy more of God we easy to think about things we did in the time past which don't anymore exist because the blood has taken control praise be to God so our problem area has always been that we accept that by Adam sinning we also sin that because he fell a lot of the times we don't have problems here but we hardly accept that Christ died for us and by his righteousness we by faith have been made righteous by once my sin by one must sin our sins was by representation and our righteousness would have to be by representation your works would not do and we struggle with this a lot of the times and Men who want to work their way through salvation it is because we think that we become Sinners by the things we did so to become righteous we have to do something I don't know that for me is the class of tonight's message I don't know how many are with me here tonight that we get to a place to think that because I did this this this that I became a sinner so for me to be a righteous person I have to do this this this no you became a sinner by representation and you'll be a just man and a just woman by representation it is not by your calculation it is not by your ability it is not what you can do or what you are able to do stop working your way through stop working your way through that would never help you in any way at best that will only make you religious there are other places where the people are here they give themselves to be bent to be cut to be whipped you are just punishing yourself for nothing you have lost the main cracks the main thing you have lost it so that is why our struggles are It Is by faith our righteousness is by faith in Christ Jesus it's not by words it's by faith getting away with everything Isaiah 1 18. if we can turn our Bibles to Isaiah 1 18. Isaiah 1 18. come now and let us reason together say the Lord the Lord himself giving us an invitation what a wonderful gesture now there are some of us here in all our lives we can only see the White House from a distance women never enter through those Gates but here the almighty God who created heaven and earth is giving us an invitation and brother Branham said that she is the Lord does not fail God speaking to his children Isaiah 1 18. and let us reason to get us here of the Lord do your says be a Scarlet they shall be as white as snow nor they be red like crimson they shall be quite as wound again it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what you have gone through it doesn't matter how much abuse you have taken at the hands of the enemy it doesn't matter what sins and what iniquities you have committed no the Lord is beating you come and let us reason together come let us reason together God did not send his only begotten son to condemn it to the world to condemn it better the word through him might be saved God is not interested in you going to hell no hair was not made for anybody Head was made for Satan and his fallen angels God has an expected end for you God has thought of peace concerning you know that you are special in the sight of God know that you are unique in the sight of God when you get up and you step out there know that you are a child of God that is working our day dress alike speak alike behave alike conduct yourself as a son as a daughter of God conduct yourself alike and wherever you find yourself know that the angels of the Lord is there you don't have to see to believe because sin is not believing as the prophet of God said you have to believe than you would see I know I told a story here before it's a story I love and I will tell it as much as I can praise be to God about that little girl some of you have heard it once some of you have heard it twice and probably somebody here over here hearing for the first time praise be to God that little girl that went to church the I would go to church every evening every Wednesday night and would close at 9 30 and on her way home she would just be sinking and going he said it was a bush Puff here in America we are very very privileged and as a matter of fact we are spoiled that we can't even come to church when our car is down we are very spoiled as a matter of fact it doesn't matter how close we live to church it doesn't matter how good the weather is if there is a problem with my car and I can even drive the further there's a problem I'm not coming elsewhere the church is probably maybe five or ten miles away and it will take you two hours to get to church and for some people it even takes longer because they are working that they will walk by the time they get to church they are already dirty by the time they get to church they're already sweating and they go and sit in that room there there is no air condition like we have it here and they sit there and they hear they would listen to the word of God in America we are support because you go asking for coffee and they'll ask you the type of coffee you want they will ask you the type of milk you want after telling a type of milk you want either two percent one percent five percent what does that mean foreign Lord have mercy this was a bush path this little guy walks on that bush path to go and praise God to close walk on that same path to go home and she's working and singing and praising God not knowing a beast of a man realized this girl doing this every Wednesday and he went and lay Ambush on that road Wednesday night waiting for this girl because he knew that the girl was going to walk back on that path lo and behold they are flying in the bush there when he heard the girl singing and coming and when the girl got closer all he saw were Ant-Man the guy was just working she didn't know what was going on foreign she didn't know what was going on she was just walking and praising God but there were men on the left men on the right that were holding arms they were out to the tits escorting her home and he fell down as dead till they passed I was told the story in 1988. these guys came from tema uh that was uh in the city I was in the north and they were sharing that story and this was in a shaman one of the most dangerous areas it took the regime of Rollins to quite to quieten them down they were committing armed robberies broad daylight and the police wouldn't go there so when you step out today no that God has given his angels charge over you musicians you can come over no that God has given his angels charge over you no that you are a son of God that you are a daughter of God speak with authority and when you speak belief because a lot of the times God is waiting he's just waiting to see you move to see you act and what do we do we're also sitting there and waiting on God getting away getting away with everything getting away with everything we have gotten away with everything we've gotten away with our sins we've gotten away with our iniquities we have gotten away with sickness everything the fall brought upon Humanity we have gotten away from them all not with some we didn't get away with some we got away with everything under the blood of our Redemption we got away with everything and the devil can never impute sin or to you because the Bible says that he that is of God sineth not [Music] the devil can never impute sin on you [Music] we may stray here a little straight there a little but just remember that there is still Blood On The Mercy Seat [Music]
