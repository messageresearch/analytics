action that we might come out of this place and say didn't our hearts pain as we speak with us move us aside our shortcomings and all that we are and above all almighty God I pray may you be a blessing to our pastor father may we not be a disappointment to his expectation but Lord may you exceed this expectation as always that is your character yes that you do the exceeding abandon above what we pray ask all think I ask that did be so tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless this congregation and also for the welcome and the privilege of standing in before them and preaching the word I ask that Lord you have your way with us tonight father we want to approach the service as though it might be our last and if ever it is our last we want to give our all in all because one of these days Lord the last prayer is going to be prayed the last song is going to be sung for the Rapture shall be upon us help us father capture this moment and maximize it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for thou art the Good Shepherd may you come into this good flock in this Tabernacle called the Good Shepherd have mercy father in Jesus name I pray amen and amen praise the Lord praise the Lord I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord so I happy to be in your midst amen I'm so glad when I go to a place where the pulpit has been designed for short people praise the Lord many times I've had to go to pulpits where there's an adjustment pseudo-platform where you stand because the preachers there are very tall but ah he is a man I say eye to eye with so I'm grateful to God praise the Lord do you love the Lord amen I'm so humbled and thankful for the invitation from our precious brother he is a well-traveled preacher with so many friends across the world so for him to have a select deliberate choice to call me for these meetings I'm very humbled and I truly appreciate him as a friend and as a preacher he did preach so well for us in our church such that I'm under pressure praise the Lord so so grateful again to meet his family and also to also have my friend brother Bill brother William a man so hosted us uh so well that I wish I had two tummies or so praise the Lord because the food was just so nice amen and I thought to myself I should have had this type of food in my youth because there now they've maximized the opportunity but nonetheless we thank God praise the Lord I greet you once again in the name of the Lord as we remain standing shall we turn to our Bibles I don't know whether my quotes and scriptures will be projected praise the Lord amen to uh Psalms chapter 23 verse 1 to 6. the thing that uh is a testimony to me is that throughout the year from the beginning of the year right after today I've just been preaching from Psalms chapter 23 and I've known brother one but I didn't know that the name of his church is called the Good Shepherd so to me that itself is a testimony I don't have to worry what to speak about I've got to speak about the Good Shepherd praise the Lord so Psalms chapter 23 which is a very familiar scripture but I always like to say there is nuggets in them familiar scriptures if we dig deep and look through the eyes of Malachi 4 5. amen so allow me to read the sound from Psalms 23 verse 1 to 6 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie in Green Pastures he leaded me beside the Still Waters He restored my soul he leaded me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepare is the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word he may take the comfort of your sins and while I'm still trying to relax myself I would like to also grip my precious elder brother from Liberia who have just met a couple of minutes ago praise the Lord he's a reverend so that also puts another layer of pressure praise the Lord because when you're preaching to a man of his caliber you'll probably go through scan through the scriptures you are saying to find the validity and the truth in them scriptures so I trust that somewhere there he will be a little bit lenient to his younger brother praise the Lord do you love the Lord amen praise the Lord now Psalm chapter number 23 is a very familiar scripture we've sang about it in Primary School we've read about it it's a scripture we've seen on posters in bookshops in places where they want to express that God is still the leader and the shepherd we've seen it it's not a new strange scripture that I have to go and ask the Sunday School to find a way of breaking it down for the little ones it's a scripture that is well known if you don't know Psalm 23 I don't know what you're doing with the Bible praise the Lord Psalm 23 is like there are the scripture the Lord is my shepherd a man that are the scripture that speaks about uh uh what we call the Lord's Prayer praise the Lord if you remember correctly The Lord's Prayer is something that we've memorized uh Through Time and Eternity praise the Lord even unbelievers know that there is a prayer that the Lord prayed so Psalm 23 is in that category are very familiar scriptures but I want you brothers and sisters as message Believers to not be familiar with scripture because the prophet speaks about the example of a man that lived by the sea too much he never be he never had the law of the sea until there was this young boy that wanted to see the sea so much never make the things of the word become common or familiar that is always power attached to a scripture there is always something significantly powerful behind every scripture despite and in spite of how much you think you know it somebody say Amen to that now as I was approaching 2023 praise the Lord you begin to scour through the scriptures to look for things to help you think about what theme to speak about in 2023 and couldn't come any better with the scripture of Psalms 23 and I particularly am so happy that I never would have invited myself to a church called the Good Shepherd of the flock praise the Lord so in God's wisdom I couldn't have come in 2022 I wouldn't have come in 2020 one I had to come in 2023 while I'm preaching about Psalm 23 to this flock named the Good Shepherd of the Flocka oh my that just makes me so excited if I Don't Preach anything spiritual I'm more of a zealous to know that in 2023 I preached in this congregation somebody say Amen to that so I'm happy or by myself because I'm here praise the Lord preaching about Psalms 23. let me put a disclaimer out there there is nothing new nothing fancy it's just what God has put upon my heart for today praise the Lord so the scripture starts by saying the Lord is my shepherd He is not saying the Lord is our I need you to you to note of that this is a scripture that is very selfish and I particularly hold it with a selfish notion I don't know about you but the Lord is my shepherd and because he's my shepherd he's led me to this place in Minnesota the place that I grew up reading in geography that there is a city with Twin Cities Saint Paul's and uh Minneapolis praise the Lord in the state of Minnesota so I'm walking through my geography Brook right now so I'm so happy that the great Shepherd has made me be familiar with all you folks so let me tell you if you are thinking that this is a scripture in the psalm for all of us you are thoroughly mistaken the scripture says the Lord is my shepherd because it's speaking about a personal revelation that David had having been a Shepherd boy himself he understood the responsibility and the weight that ownership and then you figure out there that if I have to be led if I have to be someone that is actually leading like I lead my sheep who would I want to be my shepherd and he decided conclusively that I don't know about my brother earlier I don't know about my father just say but I know for certainty that the Lord is my shepherd I could stand right there and just clarify that he is a very very selfish man there Comes A Time in one's life that God is going to be somebody that you are are familiar with or acquainted with and have a personal selfish relationship where he begins to guide you so let me tell you the Lord is my shepherd so I have come to tell you about my shepherd praise the Lord making him my shepherd does not exclude you you just have to have your own personal revelation and you can join us in this choir of saying the Lord is my shepherd praise the Lord says I shall not want praise the Lord the fact that the Lord is my shepherd He has a responsibility for my provision I shall not want praise the Lord if you have to delve deep into that part that says I shall not want praise the Lord it means I shall not diminish praise the Lord I shall not lack praise the Lord there is nothing that he has in store for me that will be beyond my rich praise the Lord and he says he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and he lead at me beside the Still Waters now the purpose for making the people of God lie in Green Pastures is such that they can defect yes with fresh food from the pasture now they are not supposed to be mobile when they are in the green pasture they are supposed to be lying comfortably eating as the shepherd is providing somebody say Amen to that then he says he leads me besides the Still Waters praise the Lord why so that there is no disturbance because you're feeding on the passage of God will determine what happens in verse number three verse number three says he restoreth my soul praise the Lord so there is no soul restoration without eating from the green pasture somebody say Amen to that that is why the prophet was given a mandate to store up the food yes because that becomes our Green Pastures and if we eat of that pasture then the next step which is so restoration takes place without Green Pastures there is no restoration without good food there is no restoration that's why the diet of the sheep is very particular you can give it what it's not prescribed to eat praise the Lord if you give it anything different to what's supposed to eat then what will happen is the soul will be malnourished and subsequently there will be no soul restoration the reason for the proper food to come to the ship is so that they can be Soul restoration somebody say Amen to that if there is sore restoration then God has accomplished this purpose he has shepherded you you shall not want he feeds you then he makes sure your soul is restored because when your soul is restored something has got to take place praise the Lord you begin to become a candidate of what we call the third pool because it's an operation from the soul it's not an operation from the body it's not an operation from the spirit it's an operation from the soul your soul must have what we call I don't know about you folks but I've read a lot about America amen down the South they call it soul food praise the Lord because food will be so nice there will be colored greens fried chicken amen uh you name it a barbecue ribs uh crayfish uh shrimp the more the food the more Soulful it is they say praise the Lord so we must never be furnished when it comes to the word of God say Amen to that somebody so he says he praise the Lord he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul praise the Lord he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay so I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thyroid and thy stuff they comfort me thou prepare us the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me I like that it's not us pursuing goodness and mercy is goodness and mercy behind us following us somebody say Amen to that praise the Lord says surely goodness and message shall follow me all the days of my life and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen of particular note in this Psalm is that it has 17 personal pronouns so it's a very selfish sound praise the lord it's not a Psalm I desire to say so Pastor what are you doing in front I'm only telling you about my shepherd hoping that he might become your Shepherd then together we might be able to say he's as mine as he is yours praise the Lord how many remember the story of brother Branham and his two daughters and uh Rebecca being young and the other one Sarah being also young and and daddy came from campaigns and and and Rebecca Ren and outran uh the little sister and gave daddy a hug and say Dad he's got all of me pray so I said I've got all of that he said said Rebecca and then Sarah somehow God gave her an instinct instant revelation of of of how to answer his sister he says you might have all of daddy but I want to tell you something daddy is got all of me praise the Lord so that's what I'm just trying to put across right there to you that I don't know about you folks praise the Lord but this is a very selfish sound you can join me and making it his he's becoming your Shepherd in your own right somebody say Amen to that so now if you count the number of there's no pronouns in this particular sound they are 17. the Lord is my one I too shall not want ye maketh me free you can read the whole personal pronouns in the 17 of them all just there is no inclusiveness he's not even speaking about his mama or his daddy he's not even speaking about the prophet who anoints him is just the Lord is my shepherd I shall not run me my me is is an i i it's a very very very selfish sound praise the Lord and the only other time we see selfish scriptures is when we see praise the lord the devil praise the Lord as Lucifer saying I shall Ascend to the most I I shall I I I in one scripture there's about four or five six personal pronouns of selfishness because he was a devil but right here I want to tell you brothers and sisters you can have an exclusive relationship with Jesus Christ that he becomes your absolute Shepherd praise the Lord you can give him all that you want so now I've got to put that scripture out to contrast the before I announce my title Jeremiah chapter number 23 verse 1 to 4. who would be unto the pastors that destroy and Scatter the ship of the my of my pasture saith the Lord therefore thus saith the Lord the god of Israel against the pastors that Feed My People ye have scattered my flock and have driven them away and have not visited them behold I will visit you upon the evil of your doings saith the Lord and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of the countries whether I have driven them and I will bring them again to my fault to their Falls and they shall be fruitful and increase and I will set up Shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no evil nor will be dismayed neither shall they be lacking saith the Lord now you find David and Jeremiah speak about this Shepherd how be it encapsulating all the qualities of a good shepherd it starts with a rebuke because they have not fed the Sheep but God being interested in the ship he gives a promise that I will always be a God that has a notion of a soul restoration so they cannot be so restoration unless the flock are fed and if they are fed then they will be fruitful and then he goes on further to say that when I feed your soul amen I'm paraphrasing then you will not fear praise the Lord and also you will not be dismayed and also you will not let and also you will have all the qualities of the Revelation that David had so you find Jeremiah is stepping into David's Revelation amen and the Revelation that David had as much as it was him relating to his God it was so inspirational that it became a standard of standards for the ship somebody say Amen to that and I give you to understand for a title I want to preach about The Marvelous Shepherd praise the Lord that's my title tonight that God is interested in being a marvelous Shepherd to you say Amen to that and have pre-fisted marvelous Shepherd there is a purpose and the reason why I put it like that praise the Lord and we all know that John chapter 10 verse 1 to 10 every obviously being the Church of the Good Shepherd it's a scripture you're probably too familiar with somebody say Amen to that it's the chapter of the Good Shepherd of the flock and I give you to understand Jesus himself who inspired praise the Lord David to catch the revelation of that intimate relationship of Shepherd and she ship and also give Jeremiah that same Revelation to capture the essence of being a good shepherd so for for that to be a good shepherd there had to be a contrast of a bad Shepherd and therefore out of it should come a marvelous Shepherd so you will find in the two contrasting scriptures the whole epitome of it comes and is encapsulated in John chapter 10 praise the Lord from verse 1 verily verily I say unto you he that entered not in the door into the sheepfall but climb it up some way the same is a thief and a robber but he that entered not in the door is The Shepherd of the ship to him the Potter openeth and the sheep hear his voice amen and equalities owned by name is shipped by name and lead them out and when he put her forth his own ship he got before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice the a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers a lot can be said about these scriptures but I'm just going through to get to the point in other words like you all say in America I'm cutting to the chase praise the Lord this number six this Parable spake Jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the dough of the ship praise the Lord all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the ship did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture you always see the predominant component in a shepherdship relationship is pasture and Leadership praise the Lord then he goes on to say the fifth cometh not but to steal to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly amen now that which was a revelation has now been made flesh and this time speak and say you shall not lack he further goes on to say no not only will you like you shall have abundance I've come that you might have your life abundantly you see lacking and provision could be breaking even but I've come to do more than break even in your life to give you a life that is fully fulfilled a life of abundance a life of provision a life where things are according to how you have eaten in the diet of the pastors I've given you when you come to understand nutrition you will understand that good nutrition means longevity good nutrition means strength good nutrition means immunity from diseases so if you are eating and feeding from the Good Shepherd he has to make sure that you eat from a menu in the diet that consists of the nutrients that will make you survive in lower this year in 2023 somebody say Amen to that praise the Lord praise the Lord I hope we're getting on okay it's an introductory service praise the Lord and I'm I'm overwhelmed that your response praise the Lord and I'm truly grateful to God for that amen so you see now what was David's Revelation amen what was Jeremiah's prophecy in Jeremiah was coming from a perspective of rebuking The Not So marvelous Shepherds and asking that they be turned to marvelous Shepherds and therefore my title is The Marvelous Shepherd praise the Lord allow me brothers and sisters to go again and read from this quotation seven compound names of Jehovah 18 praise the Lord now from here we want to make a quotation and now I have written out of the envelope here that I carried the seven compound names of Jehovah in other words it was Jehovah it was what Jehovah is is made up in these seven Redemptive names of his in other words God wants to identify himself by his characteristics and now God his attitude towards the people from Eden Back to Eden is left in these seven Redemptive names praise the Lord that makes me understand that if you were predestinated called of God from Eden before the foundation of the world and you are going back to God everything you will ever need God mix it within the framework of the seven compound Redemptive names at one point you either need one of them or two of them or all of them but whatever you require if Jehovah has to be Jehovah it's all contained in the Redemptive name somebody say Amen to that so the prophet came with it written on the paper like an envelope says I've written them all on the paper to read to the church and then he says the first one being Jehovah Jireh which means the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice praise the Lord the second one is Jehovah Rapha the Lord the Healer Manassas Shalom our peace then Roy is Shepherd now give I give you to understand he can never be a Shepherd unless he is of the highest order that's why my title is The Marvelous Shepherd and I'm preaching that in the congregation called aha so I'm here to tell you that your Shepherd ain't just good he's marvelous praise the Lord he is so marvelous in the word marvelous means he's full of Wonders things that will make you grasp in all things that will make you Marvel at his wisdom things that will make you be surprised at every time things that will make you think ain't God good things whenever you are caught between a rock and a hard place and you don't know how to come out he just comes out there he provides for himself a sacrifice everything marvelous somebody say Amen to that all right yay praise the Lord in the highest give God some crazy Place amen and amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord now to recap again we've got David catching it by Revelation we've got Jeremiah inspired to rebuke then now we have the Lord Jesus Christ coming on the scene and telling the people I am the Good Shepherd praise the Lord in telling the people that have come that you might have life and have it abundantly which means the formula for abundancy is in his compound Redemptive names at one point you need him to jail you at another point you need him to Rapha you and another point you need him for your peace at another point you need him for something somebody say Amen to that so is he he is our Rafa our righteousness and Shalom the Lord is present Lord Sharma the Lord the one I'm going to speak on is on Psalm 64. now I'm not speaking on Psalm 64. I'm speaking on the foundation of his personality encapsulated by a man through Revelation somebody say Amen to that when David wrote himself it wasn't just poetry or a song it now became much deeper because it connected with who God is praise the Lord and let me tell brothers and sisters in the message of the hour we have the correct diet to transform our bodies which means the pastors are too good praise the Lord from 1947 to 65 all that the bride needs is in them tapes and books somebody say Amen to that and in that span of life God wants to be known by his eyes characteristics the prophet says he is listen to this he says his attitude in other words how he thinks of you from Eden to Eden is wrapped up in these words praise and that is why you should never be a one-trick pony if you see somebody requesting and requiring something that you already have and you say well I'm not like that well I don't have to pray for that I have that somebody at some point needs something within the framework of the Redemptive names because God has always been wanted to be known as Jehovah not God almighty God almighty is for everyone but Jehovah is what you make him be he will be to you what you catch and have a revelation of what he is for you somebody say Amen to that so God comes in the beginning of the Exodus he speaks to Moses and says by my name Jehovah was I not known only they knew me by the name God Almighty which means it's an Universal name and just like if you come to America and don't understand a few things you'll see everyone is American from state to state until you find out that each state has its own governor and its Governor is its own laws and they all have different taxation system praise the Lord but they're all Americans what happens here is not what happens in Georgia it's not what happens in Florida amen is not what happens in the swing states it is but yet you all call yourself Americans praise the Lord now God knowing his nature that I cannot be a one-trick pony and operate and be predicted I will have to put a name that when Moses asked who to move up slavery sent me I'll say the I am so that you can fill in the party you want him to be in your life [Applause] Moses was told go and tell them that I am he sent me and then after a few chapters God comes down on the scene and says to Moses the name I am shall be a name for all generations which means you cannot Corner God you cannot box him you cannot say he is God because of this and that everybody is to experience God in their own revelation of who he is somebody say Amen to that I've had the privilege or amen or fellowshipping with people that have survived brutal War praise the Lord I've never been to where they were throwing stones I'm talking about people that dug bullets to those people they were not looking to pray for the house a house is what they were fleeing from they were looking for somewhere for to land which is that their request for God was Lord Make Me safe meanwhile someone is saying Lord if you are with me help me build this building that's a diversity and you must appreciate God in his uniqueness because each person has got to relate to God in their own experience praise the Lord so if you haven't experienced God in a certain way that somebody has experienced don't judge them because God put a very very very broad way of experience he says right as long as you come within the seven Frameworks right say Amen to that somebody I live in England and I've met people that have come as refugees to them those that came as refugees all they wanted was stability and they stay something that allows them to work every man within the framework of the laws of that state but to somebody who's never had to look for any Visa or stay in another place it's so it's so awkward that it's like why can't you go home praise the Lord there's no home to go to heaven is God's throne and Earth Is His footstool we should have that Liberty of knowing that God will provide based on our needs based on our experiences somebody say Amen to that hmm Blessed Be His holy name so what someone might be praying for might be different to what you experience and your prayers are as far as the East is from the west but God is still able to say oh you need me to gyro you I will jail you need me to give you a peace of mind I will give it right praise the Lord see I've come in a place where I know there are people who fled for their lives praise the Lord just wanting to survive others walked distances as far as their feet could carry them praise the Lord amen others praise the Lord they have lived a luxurious life the life is so boring they are thinking of suicide those are two diverse people the other one wants peace they want mental health the other one is running away the amen saying I just want survival their health is okay in terms of mentality they know that they ought not to die but somebody is so full of luxury they think that life could be better they even have enough money to buy a gun to blow their own head praise the Lord that one means the God of Peace the other one needs the good that provides they are coming from two different perspectives [Music] then you find somebody who was born barren they are issuing their prayer request is Lord just a baby I don't mind whether it's a boy or a girl others they just have babies they don't even have to pray for babies babies just come theirs is Lord provide for me to provide for my babies somebody say Amen to that and you find somebody with nine babies and a little apartment and then you find somebody with two babies and a large farm your provision level are different but God will still meet every request from every individual praise the Lord hey Pastor I I hope I don't get you into trouble I just preach how I feel praise the Lord amen I hope I'm helping somebody being able to put themselves in somebody else's shoes because if you haven't been in my shoes you will not understand my needs praise the Lord oh my my my I always get into trouble that's why I don't get invited in many places I just get into stuff that goes under the skin praise the Lord I'm not a generic preacher I'm just awkward you'll see the awkwardness doesn't start with my height it goes into my preaching as well praise the Lord so do you see how God wanted to identify himself he comes to the prophet he says right I've wrote them all here praise the Lord this is how God wants to identify with his people so I'll read that quote one more time so that I really cement it praise the Lord now from here we want to make a quotation which means it's something that you can put on a poster the quotation the prophet made we want to make a quotation and now I have written out on the envelope here that I've carried the seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah in other words it was what Jehovah is is made up of these seven Redemptive names of his and look we have highlighted now his attitude towards the people from Eden Back to Eden is wrapped in these seven Redemptive names so if you want to know how he thinks of you his attitude towards your challenge if it's kept if it's captured as a solution in the Redemptive names that's his attitude if you like he wants to provide praise the Lord if you have no peace you want to provide then the rest of all has always been said and done there is one outstanding attitude he has he wants to be your Shepherd he becomes Roy to lead you to guide you to feed you somebody say Amen to that allow me to read the beginning and ending of General dispensation 1955. now a man that's really got his face towards heaven no matter what takes place here on Earth he still got his face towards heaven his friends May forsake Him his family may forsake Him he's Pastor May forsake Him but there is one that won't forsake Him that's God and when your mind is made up I like that yes praise the Lord now in the message beginning and ending of General dispensation brother Abraham is dealing with the life of David and the Patriarchs the people that are in Babylon so that we have a clear understanding of what it is to be in this day because it's a day that's been prophesied about somebody say Amen to that then he goes on to say Daniel had bent all the bridges behind him he wasn't planning on going back anymore he wasn't watching his back his backside Trail he was looking forsaking those things which are in the past there must come a time where you forsake the things that are in the past he pressed on to the mark of High Calling that's what we should be doing that's what the church should be doing you cannot live in the past of who has abused you what has gone on whatever you've gone through whatever challenge you have faced you've got to come to a point where you say you know what I'm a Survivor and because I'm a Survivor God Will Make A Way you can't be 82 talking about a beast that happened to you at 16. there should come a time you have closure to that and know that whatever whatever couldn't kill you is because the great Shepherd was there to help you praise the lord we are living in a day where everything and everyone at some point has been abused the issue is let's find who hasn't been abused but how is it that we have people that have gone through the West gone to hell and back but when they found Jesus they found a great Shepherd their life started to be fed with the word as they were fed their soul was restored everyone your soul has been restored forgetting the things that are passed you move towards the mark of a high calling somebody say Amen to that if you are still living with the traumas of War when God brought you out of War we call that past traumatic stress disorder there is no scripture for that but the scripture we know that if you've gone through turmoil that same God can bring some peace upon your life amen that's right somebody said I'll give the message a chance don't come into the message with your hand over from your past life forgetting the things that are past put yourself in a position of saying this is a brand new start [Music] come to terms with what you've been through and understand I'm a Survivor and because I'm a Survivor I will not justify I will Thrive India because I will Thrive I will not just Thrive I'll live in abandoned life praise the Lord you should look like your past look like your future somebody say Amen to that that's the purpose and the point with which we should preach to forget the things that are past right Daniel had to bend those bridges Daniel never walked around telling people do you know me my name is Daniel I'm the one that was putting the ferry fan in the in the in the Lion's denim that survived Brothers now let me tell you the devil is real I was putting no that was an incident that happened and God kept him through that incident and when God keeps you through an incident no matter how painful it's a point for you to give God praise somebody say Amen to that so he says that that's what the church should be doing praise the Lord and as I notice then God permitted Satan to give him the test whatever you've been through who allowed it whatever you've come across that was very horrific and very painful who allowed it to give him the test and all they tested them by the fire they tested them by the Lion's Den and in every instant in every instant in every instant God brought them out more than Victorious [Music] do you see that many other testings of the righteous but God delivereth him out of them all how marvelous that is how we appreciate that I don't suppose when you're going through it file there is a sense of appreciation but the appreciation comes after you've gone through the trial then he says here then we appreciate that amen amen trials tribulations tests all working for the good after a while God can see then that he can put his trust in you and then he will do great things for you it doesn't start with great things first then you trust it starts with you going through trials tribulations painful horrific situation it means that you identify the plan of God then after he trusts you to worship after he trusts you to praise him after he starts you to begin to be a person with a consistent Christian life then yeah then then he can say right let's be let's make you more Victorious I've seen a lot of people that say if God loves me you see I will worship him if he does this and this and this and this wrong way of doing the formula the formula is you've got to be tried and tested and it's going to be thorough and see that you actually love him despite and in spite you've been to Hell and back and your thought process towards God has not changed yet this is right now let me bring you out now I can trust you now I can give you victories praise the Lord are you hearing me Church praise the Lord and he goes on he says now we find out that Daniel became an instrument in the hand of God while he was away from his own people out of his own City away from his own church in a Strange Land God used him are you hearing that away from his own people his church he is land so which means when God was dealing with Daniel as a young believer before the Lion's Den Daniel thought he loved God he thought he trusted God and it is true he loved God he trusted God but God wasn't so sure how far he can go with Daniel so he allowed and inspired the devil to have permission to inspire the people that were against Daniel and tell them right put a law and make sure that that law will find Daniel guilty and then when we do that we will sentence him then when we sentence him then we see what becomes of this guy then Daniel found himself one morning he just woke up the laws have changed men instead of Daniel crying saying oh God you brought me out of the land of our inheritance now we are here in Babylon things have just all of a sudden changed oh God kill that leader oh no no no no when the law was put Daniel used to close his windows when he prayed but on this particular day he says I will open the windows so that you don't have to investigate and send spice you'll see me break the law as I worship by God and they came and took Daniel then says Ah if the shepherd he has ordered my footsteps to go to the Lion's Den he will make a way in the Lion's Den praise the Lord so as he got to the Lions then he wasn't afraid because he had settled in his heart that Jesus Is My Savior if it's without God so then he got into there and the Lions lost their appetite for some strange reason these lions were fasting but on this particular day they lost their appetite the Bible says God closed the mouths of lions praise the Lord and as he was there praise the Lord yes the king who was his friend who knew that the laws of the myth and the peace would never be broken came to look for Daniel in the lands then which has never happened you can never look for a person in the Lions Den especially when the Lions have been fasted and especially when somebody tiny wasn't the first to be thrown in there that's right so the king came and said oh Daniel has your God delivered you how was he expecting an answer when everybody that's gone in there has never been able to say I'm alive it means Daniel was a complete different specie in terms of his relationship with God that's what we are expected yes the message of the hour and being a Christian in this day is not a picnic we go through real trials real challenges real excruciating painful things but in that if you can identify that the Lord is your Shepherd you will surely come out and when you come out you'll be good for praise the victories you have after you've survived cannot be compared to before so in other words it's a before and after I have seen people that do flipping houses they have a before when they buy start the project and then after the project has been done thoroughly the heaven after to tell you how dilapidated and gutted this property was but it was so much hard work we put into it so much that this is the end product that's the life of a Christian it is a before and in after before trial and then after trial and watch what God will do if you survive your child without without sleeping somebody say Amen to that so he says here Daniel became an instrument you can never become an instrument but God never wants you to share a theoretical gospel he wants you to share an experience yes you can't talk about oh I survived when all you had was a headache because you never drank much water you were dehydrated there must be stuff come your way that defy who you are yes and when they Define who you are you will know for certainty that God is your absolute so when you see David saying the Lord is my shepherd He is making God his absolute Believers all this listen to this now that's right out of his own City away from his own church in a Strange Land God used him now you can be away from whatever you may be you can be away from your loved ones or you can be away from your church but you can still be an instrument in the hands of God God can use you for a testimony or for anything that he wishes to use you for beautiful examples the Bible is just so shagged full of those things everywhere you turn don't you love to read the word congregation says hey oh I love to read it sometime we weep and here a few days ago I was reading in the room there and I just had to sit down and cry like a baby I just got up and walked around my chair and put my hand on my chair and looked down at my Bible again and I broke down broke out went around the chair again looked at it again and I thought oh God here is eternal life to every man or woman that will dare put their trust in him and believe it eternal life praise the Lord this is what the prophet did he had been reading his Bible throughout the night then as he was reading and it began to impress upon his heart so deep then he began to cry and then he put his Bible on the chair he looked at he says him there is eternal life looking just at the Bible look daddy that says oh then he went around the chase oh God if you know what this is and then you put your trust in it and then he did it a few times and he says oh and he said search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life they are they which testify of you amen then he goes on to say the word of God is a lemon to our feet what we that we should be guided then the light it's the light that follows the pathway that leads us from victory and you can never have Victory unless you've been in a battle now before you get a victory there has to be a battle and if there is no battles there is no victory which means victories start with survival stories what the devil meant for Eve remember the Good Shepherd in John chapter 10 he says the enemy comes to kill steal and destroy but I am calm that you might have life abandoned it can become more abundant than being Victorious and then thereafter have eternal life so that pathway to our Victory starts from Eden to Eden and in our survival journey we'll be using the Redemptive names praise the Lord are you happy so far praise the Lord I'm about to finish so we ought to be thankful for the battles and trying and it's God giving us the opportunity to have victories who can truly say thank you Lord for the battles and the flyings because it's God's opportunity for victories oh my those that make you a little bit better now see the battle come along somebody's saying something bad about you sickness come to you unto you maybe God give you those light afflictions that he might heal you and show you his favor to you let you see what he means by it he loves you the old Shepherd story that's told in Jerusalem in the Holy lands of a Shepherd was packing the sheep and said what are you begging it for says he's got a broken leg said how did you do that follow over the cliff said no I broke its leg he said why you're a cruel Shepherd to break the shepherd's leg said no I loved it do you understand what I'm alluding to most of you folks didn't pray to come to Minnesota no you were comfortable wherever you were but God wanted you here so trials came for all you know right now as we speak you could have been in some other place you could have been into but God didn't have a purpose for you in Timbuktu His science never LED you to Timbuktu the great Shepherd knew there's going to be a Shepherd so he had to allow the trials and testings to come from wherever you are so that you find yourself in destination Minneapolis sure that wasn't voluntary yes yes nobody chooses affliction nobody chooses nothingness to come upon their life but when it comes and you embrace it as God's leadership seeing that is the great Shepherd what will come out of it is much more sweeter than you can ever envisage praise the Lord that is why brothers and sisters no matter what you've been through don't live in your past live in your future somebody say Amen to that praise the Lord and listen to this as the prophet goes on sometimes God has to let let us break down just a little bit in health to give us extra attention to guess to get us upon his lap to who Us in his bosom when the doctor said nothing can be done how many have ever heard the news that we are so sorry your cancer that's when you say it's not mine your cancer is far gone it's malignancy is so much that there is nothing can be done then you walk into a humble church with God-fearing people and prayer changes things and then you see that what it took scientists to discover and measure and even tell you how far you can go out all it needed was for you to identify yourself as the Sheep of God praise the Lord and he says here it will give you extra attention to get us upon his lap to woo Us in his bosom when the doctor said nothing can be done then he take us into his bosom and say see I love you I'm going to let you get well oh Co doesn't that make life a little better congregation says he is so great he is a marvelous Shepherd what am I trying to tell you no matter how negative or nasty news comes upon you let not your first reaction be disappointment but rather have in you a reflex that says maybe God is trusting me right to praise him in spite and if I can Praise Him in my situation he'll be beautiful he will make a way maybe God wants to give me special attention have you ever noticed Whenever there is bad news that you clutch your Bible like you've never done before you listen to tapes like you've never done before that's God saying now let me woo you a bit let me show you my love but that didn't come by God sending you a present it came by God allowing his trust for you to let the Devil tempt you that's what he did to job being the great shepherd He under that guy will not sell out never he had properly tested and tried him and made him a guinea pig of perfection before the stage of a perfect man you has already testified to be perfect before we even knew what it took for Perfection that it took Faith virtue knowledge long-suffering Temperance right up to the Brotherly Love job was satisfied perfect amen and God was so happy with the Perfection of job he says but there's one more trial we just need to check so that before we put our stem for QC quality tested let's just make sure that a few things are in order this is even the devil wasn't interested in The Proposal slides let's have you considered myself and job the devil says why would I waste my time look at this guy you've blessed him which means you have generated him remember the Redemptive names are to work throughout from Eden to Eden you've provided for him he's got peace of mind the only thing he worries about is that his children might blaspheme so I have no business tempting job his account is okay his bank balance is fine his animals are producing well there's nothing wrong in his life why would I attempt and to top it all up you've put a hedge around him that's right and uh the devil said Lord you can't ask me to respond to him to a mission impossible says okay let's make it lighter what should we do to make it like this remove all the gods says okay we will remove the guards because we want to play fair but just don't touch his soul don't touch the guy see so what shall we do what are the parameters and if you understand that whatever you're going through parameters have been set right God will not allow you to be tempted above what you can be praise the Lord and with every Temptation there is a way of Escape he says right go ahead let's start with killing the animals it says no we want to do it in such an overwhelming Style we can't do it in installments we can make the ship die this year and the cows next year and the camels next year but one and then somewhere there we bring an epidemic and kill the children years later so let's all do it in one day and let's make sure one escapes now if you came to me to tell me my children are dead only I am escaped I'll kill you because I'll tell you why did you escape to come into me did you not have anything to do with the death of my children that's human that's humanistic but when God is flying your character he must make sure you have enough power for the victory he expects of you so he says let's do it in one day so job just wakes up on a particular Wednesday one by one it was so overwhelming such that the guy could be could not be consoled because God was sure of his Perfection just like God was sure of Daniel's Perfection yes Daniel lived a perfect life that there is nothing mentioned about Daniel's life that is disastrous God said put it on him to overwhelm him but was job overwhelmed no for some reason something within him knew that he can never fail me there is a master plan he is a great shepherd He is a marvelous Shepherd praise the Lord hence now the court goes on to say oh sorry person say sometimes when he gives us that then he becomes The Marvelous Shepherd amen and then now the prophet alludes to the fact that no wonder David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and how he leads us by the side of the Still Waters and restores their soul I want you to make particular note of Soul restoration because everything that God has to do with you he's going to do it with you from the perspective that you are part of it through your soul so without your soul being restored there is nothing that your faith will latch onto that will be profitable because it's not a head knowledge it's something within yes listen to this and anoint us are anointed in the presence of your enemy just to testify till your cup boiled over you know just how marvelous he is Anointed in the presence of thine enemy now the reason why I mentioned the term nevertheless Shepherd is coming from the original word for the meaning of marvelous in the Greek you will go to the scripture of Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 which says unto us a child is given and to us a son is born he shall be called wonderful that's the first on the names of the coming son the Lord Jesus Christ that word wonderful in Hebrew is Pala and Pele is the noun Pele is the adjective like Pele the footballer that word means wonderful and the only other time that scripture was used the first time it was ever used it was used in Genesis Chapter 18 when God said is anything too hard for the Lord so his name had to be called wonderful the other name for wonderful is marvelous that's why now I call him The Marvelous Shepherd and every time the prophet makes a comment on God's goodness as a Shepherd he uses marvelous Shepherd praise the Lord believe without this and he says oh my allow me to read this the Good Shepherd of the Sheep let me skip right up I've read there's quite a lot of stuff there to read let me skip right that to paragraph paragraph 22. sorrows and tears can never keep the shepherd away are you hearing that corruption he proved it at the grave of Lazarus Lazarus was one of his little lamps and he was lying in the body bottom of the pits and the stone rolled over it his body was molded the nose had dropped in the skin worms had eaten him up but the chief Shepherd come up to the Grave he node his ship by name and he speaks your name now calls you you answer now there's going to be a time set the prophet that he will call and I will answer him Lazarus was four days dead his body corrupted but the shepherd spoke in corruption knew its maker and the Soul there was four days journey watch this the body was decomposing in the grave but the soul was four days journey today from Eden to Eden are you with me and the body had been embalmed no blood the cells was broke he was rotten in the grave but the Shepherd Of Life spoke the name of his lamp and his lamp let out a bleach and said here I come then intriguing to me was the fact that this quotation had to be on paragraph 23. oh he is a marvelous Shepherd praise the Lord whether God is just trying to be humorous whether it's a coincidence but I don't think it is I honestly think that every time you read Psalm 23 and you go to the message the Good Shepherd of the word you'll understand the paragraph 23 the Lord says I am a marvelous Shepherd let him feed you you will feed you on his word the Holy Spirit lives by the word of God the great Shepherd of the flock suddenly he cannot lose one it would be a disgrace you say brother you mean to tell me that when the Bible looks it says God told Israel away down in Egypt I gave him you Palestine and now he wouldn't just let up there and be excommunicated the whole thing run them all out with the plague killed them all off he wouldn't he wouldn't have went up there and sent fear among them and drop them out of the country but he said Israel it's yours you go get it now that's where I used to have a dilemma whenever God sent you to go get something you almost think that it's going to be easy no you go get it you are thinking you will just be finding stuff that you just come because God said go get it the shepherd knows that he will not lead you unless he's given you capacity through the soul restoration so your faith is from your soul that has been restored through the feeding of the shepherd's food there when he says go for it you've got enough action and power to fight to obtain it so he then says it's yours go get it they had to fight for every inch of ground they stood on every promise in the book of The Great Shepherd is to his sheep which means the sheep have been well nourished their souls have been restored there's not enough devils in the hell that could ever stop the move of God that God fore ordained and so in their lives there is not enough abortions there is not enough depression there is not enough heartaches there is not enough death pain that you might have ever experienced that will stop the move of God that is put in your heart you see we are in the message in the message we shouldn't throw pity parties we should just point each other to the promise and as long as the word has been thoroughly put in the soul you can do more than you think you can do I have a friend of mine I won't mention his name but he's an ex is a very renowned Soldier so every time I'm driving with him in his BMW I'm asking him about a soldier things capacity how many miles have you walked what's the longest distance you've taken and he's kept on telling me that your body can take more than you think it can take only that it doesn't be subjected to those things now if a soldier by just training in the military knows what the body is capable of how much more should we know what our souls are capable of juicy brothers and sisters that whatever you're going through I've come to let you know here in Minnesota Minneapolis to be specific praise the Lord that greater is he that is in you and God through your Affliction has already trust some people have already been trusted they've seen the west of the West you can now be trusted to sit down with somebody with a problem that they can't put their head around and tell them it's going to be all right because you come out the other end may God bless you who praise the Lord as I invite our pastor praise the Lord how many believe that he's a great Shepherd tries to our [Applause] praise the Lord many times we find ourselves whenever something negative happens we think where is God does he love me he actually does that's the evidence that he does if you pass your test then you get the kind of trust that is always wanted for you to go through amen so we go through life in its stages in pain but yes there is one thing that should remain certain the power of God in our lives through his shepherding capability that is why brothers and sisters I'll tell you tonight when David said the Lord is my shepherd right there all the pain and the trauma he could have faced from his background of fighting his all Acceptance in his family Soul on the other side all the battles he knew that as long as I have got treatment at one point he came from a battle and he saw the whole entire family taken away he never he never bowed down and started speaking foolishly charging God foolishly instead what did he do he said bring me an effort and then he encouraged himself in the Lord It's the only scripture where you hear that men cried until they couldn't cry anymore and after crying instead of saying where is God they wanted to Stone David because they had a blame culture that's why I've come to tell you praise the Lord don't blame your past over your future rise up above it you have the capability the reason why you are not in some denomination and God LED you to the message he knew that's where there is the food that will allow your soul restoration he knew that there is the food that will allow a reboot you can feel on top of your situation again praise the Lord quit being a victim and don't have a victim mentality greater is he that is in you I can I will I do believe I can I will I do believe I can I will I do feel live does [Music] lead the Lord only in the Lord that Jesus is [Music] I do believe I can I will I do believe I can I will I do believe that Jesus heals me now Saints I'm going to say I know he's led me this far but I want a much higher of a relationship with him as my great Shepherd I don't want to be a victim of circumstances but I want to overcome every circumstance is a testament that God is my shepherd the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. one he leaded me to Green process though I lie in the value of the shadow of death don't never live your life with underlining fear because the Lord is still in control shall we pray our heavenly father almighty God we lift up holy hands unto you many times Lord our faith is crippled by the amount of fear we entertain but tonight father I pray in Jesus name the same Revelation you gave to David that you will stand up and raise his hands and say the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want father we want you to exclusively own us be the absolute of our lives and be our real Shepherd Let It Be almighty God that each day and its each moment we live as Christians we live a life that attracts more of you in our lives more Revelation and power available to us through the trials and temptations we go through knowing that father you never allow us to go into those things unless you have a plan to make us overcome and therefore Lord when we pass the test we almost we always come out the other end as your trusted servants to be used no doubt Lord this is an introductory service with the folks here I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that these few words I've been able to say may they take meaning o God in the hearts of your people may they be a people that will come out of this place and say did our hearts Ben as he speak with us father it's not a coincidence Lord that this is the church name the Good Shepherd oh God you are still the Good Shepherd of this ship and I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may you give them life abundant according to the promises you've given the promises that are sure and Amen Let It Be Lord you become not just a Shepherd in their lives but a marvelous Shepherd to operate and work wonders in their lives even as the prophet said oh I wish our time to speak about this individually I ask that Lord you might help these
