foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] book in the Bible and it is Trials like we go through now and his wife even at the closest thing to him on Earth so I want you to curse God and die to death he said thou speak us like a foolish the lord gave the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord and then when the spirit of God come upon him and he began to prophesy said I know my redeemer liveth and the last days you'll stand upon this Earth though the skinworks destroys his body yet my flesh shall I see God and he made a place to bury himself he said about by this ground and he's bought there and buried himself later on become a man named Abraham Church growing coming on up Abraham but now he had the potentials of God too everlasting life eternal because God called him now notice when he died or Sarah died he bought a piece of ground in Palestine near job's grave and buried Sarah Abraham died and also was buried with Sarah Abraham begot God Isaac and Isaac when he died he slept with Abraham in the same personal ground now when Isaac begot Jacob Jacob died way down in Egypt but being a prophet now with this potential this quickening power he said don't you bury me down here Joseph come here my Prophet son put your hand upon this hip that God crippled swear to the god of Heaven do not bury me down here what was in that man why wasn't Egypt just as good as any place he was he was a prophet you know where that Resurrection is going to be what's going to be in Egypt be in Palestine so put your hands up on my hip and you swear with a God that I've served you're my Prophet son that you'll not bury my bones down here take me up your honor and bear me Joseph being a prophet also ladies hands upon his daddy said I swear over the god of Abraham I think of Jacob I'll not bury you here they're talking about buried him up in that land why why when Joseph died he said don't you marry me down here don't bear me down here why God's got everywhere but he has a plan Joseph was a prophet he said someday listen to these words the Lord God will will visit you and we'll take you out of this land and when you go you take my bones amen that quickly power was in that boat oh we have the spirit of him that raised up Christ the dead dwelling he'll also Quicken your mortal bodies don't put my bones down here bury him up there but those are the promise when Jesus come here I've got a scripture here at Matthew 27 51 when Jesus raised from the dead job seen that coming said I know my redeemer living stand upon this Earth though the skin worms has destroyed this body yet my face shall see God I've seen him they know that was a prophet Abraham was a prophet Isaac was a prophet Jacob was a Prophet Joseph was a prophet and they had the revelation of God according to his word on that Easter morning when that one came and redeemed all those who had believed on him they raised too according to the Bible that quickening power come into the grave of job where there wasn't even a spoonful of the Dust of his bones left after all those hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years his bones had decayed it went back and turned back to the gases of the Earth just a mere Ash dustly there but yet when that's quickening power according to the word of God to the promise hundreds and hundreds yes thousands of years later when that quickly power would brought forth the grave job Abraham Isaac Jacob Harlem come out of the Grave with him the Bible said so Saint Matthew the 27th chapter and 51st verse is that many of the saints that slept in the dusty Earth resurrected it come out of the graves with him when he come up on Easter morning why they had that potential they had that quickening power see and raised up from the dead and went with him in the resurrection enjoyed the resurrection with him because they were full of that quickening power they had that genuine Easter seal where they say I wish sadly back the Old Testament wait a minute and first thesis Thessalonians the fourth chapter of the 16th verse oh she read that I would not have you ignorant Brethren concerning those that sleep that you saw or not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again the third day not make belief but we believe even so them that sleep in him shall God bring with him the New Testament Saints with that quickening power shall resurrect also at his second coming just as sure as the Old Testament Saints with all that quickly powerful in their bones and translations and powers and so forth as shown of God their prophets who the word of God came to they resurrected with him on that Resurrection Marty and with the promise of God that everyone that's in Christ Jesus will also come with him in his resurrection the quickly power of God upon the bones no wonder we lay hands on the sick no wonder we love one another we're brothers and sisters we shouldn't hate one another because we're corrected by the word of God we should love one another and have respects for one another you know if you don't it won't help you there's a little fellow sitting right here under this church now a few days ago that man believes little old boy had a cancer on his ear and he wouldn't say nothing about he's working up there at the house I've been on a hunting trip with him up there at the Mosley Brothers Dawson here was up here hunting brother William's son and I have to look over on his ear and I see his air all swollen up and I said what's the matter Donovan that ear he said Brother Bear it's been a long time but don't know I just missed calling him to the hand there that was a big cancer on his ear never said one word just held it without my brother in a day or two at that there was even a star left of it it was his respect to the god of Heaven by his quickening power kill that cancer and spared the life of Donovan words back there it's right what is these things look at your people here in Phoenix look at you people who's believed in this look the people who has this that lays our hands upon you watch what happens it's quickening power these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sink that quickly power Eagle to Eagle something's going to take place not equal to a buzzard won't work Eagle to Eagle raises from the barnyard to the heavenlies these signs shall follow them that believe and they're both in believe see that same quickening power of God represented in these two prophets Elijah and Elijah notice same word one of them is ketchup the others caught up catch up and caught up see he was caught up we'll be ketchup catch up with them meet him in the air be caught up to meet him in the air notice a bird has to have two Wings to balance itself is that right Elijah was a translating Wing Elijah Elisha was a resurrection wing see both of them together representing the saints that are living and the saints that are gone on remember Quicken to see the past the curtains how these people were quickened back there to look past the curtain and see down in this time those prophets look at Paul said in the last days how these people would be acting call themselves Christians he was a prophet full of the quickening power four sword come to pass we believe that don't we he received quick and power look at the quickening power today for telling things without one event missing not one time does it fail quickening power not the power of a man the power of God the power the abstract of Easter the resurrected Jesus has sent back the abstract to guarantee us that we're already quickened with him notice you remember the book businessman you're looking to pass the curtain of time and I begin to get older knowing my days are getting shorter now I get real I play that little piece of them ladies saying a while ago I've had it for about 18 20 years now I want to talk it Overlord they get out there and go to praying then acquainting power comes I'm rested up and I looked up there and I said look at the honor I remember that morning being called a past and my wife sitting back there laying on the same bed with me that morning and I was raised up and looked up in there she is asleep and I said if I'm gonna do anything to the Lord you better hurry up or hear it past 50. and the Holy Spirit caught me away and I looked over there I've seen those Saints just as certain I'm standing here but this desperate this sacred book laying here in a minister of the Gospel have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord about what happened I want you to tell me about it every time has it been perfectly at the platform every time has it happened just like he said this was thus saith the Lord I stood there and looked over that time I've seen tens of thousands times thousands coming young men and women run throwing their arms around me screaming I'll look right back see myself laying on the bed oh Lord let me look at past the curtain of time what is it it's creating power now it catches away that great quickly power the quickening power coming this last days that's what I'm in Arizona for right now there's many people sitting right here stood right here in Phoenix and heard me tell you from this very platform the saith the Lord how many remembers it uh of course something's fixing to happen I saw seven angels come didn't Life Magazine packet is the fog of it floated across here 27 miles high and 30 miles across it's not Fred stopping these other Gene Norman I'm sitting back there stood right there with them seven angels appeared right there on the hill to shut the heels through miles around like that there stood seven angels and thought a sword in your hand said go home and open these Seven Seals they're given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and the force and the Serpent's Seed and all these things it's been fussed about it's thus saith the Lord what is it's equating power coming to the church making it already this hour that we're approaching quickening power oh God help us to receive it even help us to believe it see it depends on what attitude you take to it or do you any good or not so you had to believe that if you don't believe it it won't do you one bit of good house Samuel stood there before that people and said have I ever told you anything in the name of Lord but what happened did I ever beg you for your money to live on no but we want the king anyhow that's the way the church is today they want their own ideas they won't pay a bit attention to either walk right around well it just go show the quickening powers not there Paul would say well I've spoke in tongues I jumped I shouted that's all fine but that quickly Powers there you'll recognize like a little ego that's his mama that's the word that's thus saith the Lord that's what God promised that's what was foretold that's exactly what happened we're Beyond any shed of Doubt potentially in the resurrection right now the Saints getting ready to be taken up in the air so Jesus so full of this quickly power said if you can destroy this Temple it took you 40 years you thought the bill I'll raise it up in three days why why could Jesus say that I want to ask you why could Jesus say a thing like that he knew that he was amen amen I wish I could make that stick he knew who he was he knew that every word God had wrote in there of him had fulfilled it he knew he was one David spoke of do you know you're the one the Bible speaks up yes do you know your position is in Christ if you're in Christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like everyday living to you well sure it's yours you are an eagle at your food he knew that by the power of God he would do it because it was prophesied he would do it that's the reason he wasn't scared to say destroy this Temple I'll raise it up in three days because David said I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption he know not one cell of his body would corrupt and he corrupts in 72 hours he said destroy this Temple I'll raise it up again in three days why he was so full of that quickening power that quickened every word he looked back and seen every word god wrote of him that Prophet said he'd fulfilled it he know that would be fulfilled too now every word that God said has your spirit said amen to it has been fulfilled in your life as a believer do you hold back on something say well my church teaches different then be careful Paul notice Eagles believe there's no question to them they believe it notice now he knew it would have happened because the word said it wasn't every word wrote of him had to be fulfilled he knew that it was written by the power of God by the holy prophets that had prophesied that he would do so and prophecy never fails it cannot the word of God can't fail and it is written in the by the spirit that is now also the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead if it dwells in your being your body it will also Quicken your mortal mortal then shoot it burn it do anything you want to make fun of it tear it down turn it down do what you want to God will raise it up for you said he would man every saint of God has that promise and he knows that that's the truth so fear not brother we already into Easter look now that Transfiguration just before we close Transfiguration we are all represented there and Transfiguration look what we are seeing today notice just what we're seeing today the quickening power of God where's all there there was a dead Saints represented in Moses there was a resurrection in Jesus Christ glorified Elisha Moses Elijah and Jesus all standing on the mountain the dead Saints the raptured Saints and Jesus glorified oh my God why you say I heard a guy say this you people why if you had this kind of power you ought to go out and tell people what you can do far be it from a real Christian saying a thing like that see surely we don't claim no power to but we do one thing when they looked her out of all this power upon him they saw Jesus only and a real True Believer don't care whether he's backing up a denomination or nothing about it he only wants one thing for you to see that glorified Christ makes any difference a real true Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ he did glorify Moses and glorify Elijah and glorify themselves and glorify nothing else but they seem to glorify Christ and any True Believer that's what's in his heart to glorify Jesus Christ that's what he's trying to get the people see not say well if you come join our groups if you come do this or do that oh don't do that don't do that see God's word which is Christ magnified and fulfilled the promise of this day in this great hour of Resurrection notice and it gives them joy to know that we are with him a flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones what a joy that's the only thing a real believer cares about they don't care about a denomination they don't care about an organization they don't care about what the other women think they don't care certainly not they won't do these things that these other women do these men will do them things they won't hang and baby around with some organization keep being putting out and afraid they won't have a meal ticket they don't care about them things there's nonsense to them there's only one heart's desire that is to see Jesus Christ glorify yes there conduct must be with God it must absolutely nothing else but just the glory of Jesus Christ and what is Jesus the word is that right amen amen now I noticed and seeing his same Vindicated method proving his resurrection now what is it seeing your life by his promised word that he said he's the same yesterday and forever proving that he's still alive I don't care if every door in the country's close to me and I'm as I said I was 56th of the day snapped out I'm at the heart attack age I mean all this other agent everything else well what difference it didn't make any difference to me when I was a kid it don't make any difference now one hour my numbers called my card out the rent I don't care if they ever know they ever lived on the earth it don't make me no difference you don't have to have no big monuments and big Billings to say that I was showing her one thing I want to let me all to know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and in my heart I hold his abstract and I know that Sunday although I may be drowning in the sea I may be killed in Africa I don't know what happened to me if there's one thing I know I'll hold the abstract Hallelujah door can be closed I don't make a bit of difference to me I'm not trying to glorify some man or some organization nor myself or another group sir nothing else I want people to see Jesus Christ is raised from the dead and his Spirit lives same yesterday today forever no wonder Jesus said fear not I am he that was dead but I'm Alive forevermore for now we are Redeemed by him and are risen with him and are now not will be sitting in Heavenly places in him now when we have this spirit in us the abstract shows that all of the doubts has been stricken off what Christ lives in amen Lord I live not me Christ lives in me not you live but Christ lives in you because his Living Word lives in you showing that all the accounts of all your methodists and Baptists and Pentecostal ideas and everything else are stricken off Amen in Jesus Christ like on mount's Transfiguration all the prophets and everything else is finished all the days of the Lutheran the Methodist the Presbyterian they're all right but this is my beloved Son hear ye him the word of this hour thou are the Seals when all the Mysteries back counter has been hit all these years then that Great Pyramid of time we're stricken off The Headstone making home down so that the Star of David will settle into its place and the great Church of the Living God will be raised like the wings of an eagle I doubt in our hand to Glory yes in now and now in our bodies with speaking with new tongues with prophesying and foreseen laying hands on the sick and they recover the world dead and all the things of the world we've passed from Death of the life and we now hold the power Hallelujah on that Resurrection morning when death seals will be broken we shall rise Hallelujah we shall rise amen there ain't enough devils in the hell to keep us from doing it we were forwarding of God for this hour the word of God manifests itself right through us and we live in the presence of God by the word promise of God Amen in a devil in hell can keep me from Raising the seals have been broken Hallelujah free I'm an eagle I'm no longer in a cage but I'm free of rays from the dead into the new life of Jesus Christ not only me but every man woman boy or girl sitting here that's been filled into that spirit of God is a new creature in Christ and you are a eagle we are alive today and enjoy the resurrection forevermore because he lives we are alive also and he's living us making us alive and the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in our being shall Quicken arm mortal bodies so that great Eternal Easter God oh take but give me Jesus amen [Music] I love him he's all the world to me and the cause that you are a part of him I am a part of you and you are a part of me and together we are part of him oh Christian what an opportunity we have we have opportunities to say Paul never dreamed of have it we had opportunities that Enoch and Elijah and all them never had the opportunities we have now and there's one little sheep out in her some of her and he'll not be satisfied until that one comes in the fall by the help of God in my vision and thus saith the Lord I'm returning across the sea that last little sheep may be a black one down there for all I know or they don't even think they got a soul but God knows different yes I'm going to sleep till the last day of my life to find that one wherever it is I hope I never have offended any of my brethren but saying these strict things out not as I don't want you to go to church sure I want you to go to church you go to church wherever you're going but just don't let that be your hope say well I belong to this or I belong to that whole brother sister belong to Christ go to church belong to Christ yeah yes amen let that let that potential if that isn't in you Quicken you right now to life won't you just receive it now this room's full of it I feel it all over me I know it's here the power of God the great Seer of visions the Great foreteller that can tell the things that it never fails a great one that can speak and no man can say it's an old a man can open and no man can shut he that was dead is now alive amen and alive today here in Phoenix walking amongst the newborn flowers [Music]
