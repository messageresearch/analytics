[35:09] praise the lord amen what almighty god
[35:13] we serve
[35:14] jesus is the girl we serve amen
[35:17] praise the lord the truth about that is
[35:20] that uh
[35:23] brother branham says jesus
[35:26] body after his ascension
[35:30] was is sitting on the throne of god
[35:34] when we get to heaven that's the only
[35:36] image that we will see
[35:38] but his his body is there as a memorial
[35:43] and that memorial is because
[35:46] of the blood you know the body stains as
[35:50] a memorial before the father
[35:52] that the blood was sheared for the
[35:54] redemption of the word
[35:56] amen praise the lord but
[36:00] the actual body of jesus is
[36:04] this body on earth is this body
[36:08] which is the church and uh the church
[36:12] is the greatest move of god that is on
[36:15] the earth
[36:16] so if you if we if we miss the purpose
[36:18] of the church
[36:19] if we miss the purpose of why we are
[36:22] gathering here
[36:23] i mean we miss everything praise the
[36:26] lord
[36:26] you know we miss everything can uh that
[36:30] that will be that would be the greatest
[36:32] sin you know that uh
[36:34] a man or a woman would commit is
[36:37] is missing the purpose of god for our
[36:39] lives
[36:40] praise the lord you know so we will talk
[36:43] a little bit about that this morning
[36:46] you know uh because
[36:49] even jesus said in saint john he says
[36:53] in that day you will no longer pray
[36:56] to me you know we prayed in the name of
[37:00] jesus
[37:01] but we don't pray to jesus you know
[37:05] i know just a lot of information for an
[37:09] introduction this morning but i pray
[37:11] that the holy spirit will be able to
[37:13] help us
[37:14] as we look into the subject this morning
[37:17] but we greet you in the name of the lord
[37:19] jesus
[37:19] we want to bring greetings from brother
[37:22] paul lafontaine
[37:23] uh just like i said wednesday night we
[37:26] met him over
[37:27] dead in uh in china
[37:30] uh brother uh juan and steve cassidy and
[37:34] myself travel there the
[37:37] uh to support them in the service they
[37:40] were having that night brother
[37:42] paul i actually forgot but he sent me an
[37:45] email
[37:46] uh earlier this year that he was going
[37:48] to be bringing his mother down
[37:51] to uh i think the milwaukee area
[37:55] and then he was going to get in contact
[37:58] with me and he was going to fly from the
[38:00] year and spend the sunday with us and go
[38:02] back and pick up his
[38:04] mother that's where his mother is
[38:06] originally from
[38:07] so they couldn't make the trip because
[38:09] of all of the
[38:10] kovic thing going on so they decided
[38:14] to do the trip this time around so
[38:17] brother joe got a hold of him and he was
[38:19] preaching there for brother jordan we
[38:20] went
[38:21] to visit with them a little bit and and
[38:24] have us
[38:24] had a service our sister we were praying
[38:27] for sister mary
[38:28] uh that was in the accident went to be
[38:30] with the lord
[38:31] last saturday so yesterday they had a
[38:35] funeral i spoke with her pastor
[38:37] bernard michael brown i was actually
[38:39] planning to go
[38:40] for the funeral yesterday
[38:43] but then something came up too so i
[38:45] couldn't go
[38:47] but uh uh they laid our sister to rest
[38:50] yesterday and uh and we want to
[38:54] just thank the lord for that praise the
[38:56] lord
[38:57] amen and uh
[38:59] [Music]
[39:02] one of our one of my senior brothers
[39:05] also back home passed away
[39:07] so they will be doing his funeral next
[39:10] week as well so
[39:11] i mean it's just been so many people
[39:15] going home amen
[39:17] praise the lord but if the lord is
[39:19] keeping us here
[39:20] i believe he's keeping us here for the
[39:22] purpose praise the lord
[39:23] amen so uh i mean
[39:29] i know we kind of escaped our
[39:34] our communion service last sunday
[39:38] but there are just some few things
[39:42] that uh we've been praying about
[39:46] and i'm hoping that we can be able to
[39:50] to have our next communion service
[39:54] coming up here soon by the grace of god
[39:57] but uh like you all know we never want
[40:00] to make those things
[40:02] uh you know just a tradition we never
[40:06] want to
[40:06] just get ourselves so common to it you
[40:09] know there's a blessing
[40:10] when the local church you know walk
[40:13] in the light of the scripture that way
[40:16] keeping communion
[40:17] watching one another faith baptising and
[40:20] all of those different things
[40:22] that the lord has instructed us to do
[40:24] there is surely a blessing for it
[40:27] and uh but yet you know
[40:30] we try to look at the local body
[40:34] you know and make sure that
[40:38] we can be able to bring those things uh
[40:41] in in the right time for it to be a
[40:43] blessing
[40:45] for it to be a blessing and uh
[40:50] there are some few things upon my heart
[40:51] that i've been praying about
[40:53] and just asking the lord how he's going
[40:56] to help us
[40:57] how he's going to lead us in dealing
[40:59] with those things
[41:00] praise the lord i'll find time for us to
[41:03] talk about it
[41:05] but this morning we will we will go back
[41:08] to
[41:08] uh a little bit of what we were speaking
[41:11] on wednesday night

[41:15] then he brought us a very wonderful
[41:17] message on the revelation of jesus
[41:19] christ
[41:20] and he hired us to be able to look at
[41:23] some few thoughts on that subject
[41:28] so this morning i would i would just

[41:32] spirit

[50:06] service like he did for us wednesday
[50:08] night amen
[50:09] we had a good time wednesday night and
[50:12] and we thanked the lord for that we were
[50:14] looking at the revelation of jesus
[50:16] christ
[50:17] and and like the way i said it is that
[50:21] the bride of jesus christ is the
[50:23] continuation
[50:24] of the revelation of jesus christ praise
[50:27] the lord
[50:28] we are the continuation of the
[50:30] revelation of jesus christ
[50:32] and this is what we were we were
[50:35] studying and looking the revelation of
[50:38] jesus christ which
[50:39] god gave to him looking at that phrase
[50:42] that god
[50:43] gave jesus the revelation of jesus
[50:46] christ
[50:47] praise the lord so we were trying to go
[50:50] back to genesis chapter 1
[50:53] uh and you know and we went to genesis
[50:56] chapter one in the beginning
[50:58] god created the heaven and the earth and
[51:00] we came to sin
[51:01] john chapter one in the beginning was
[51:04] the word and the word was with god and
[51:06] the word was god so
[51:08] we were trying to see god that created
[51:11] the heaven and the earth was the word
[51:14] you know uh in john chapter 1.
[51:18] now but this morning i want us to look
[51:22] at
[51:22] matthew chapter 1 matthew chapter 1.
[51:33] i just pray that the law will just
[51:36] capture us in this world and
[51:40] we can just have a prayer meeting at the
[51:43] end of this service
[51:46] instead of having a long long
[51:50] preaching we can have a prayer meeting
[51:52] praise the lord
[51:54] amen
[52:00] matthew chapter one
[52:05] we'll come back to our our subject in
[52:08] revelation chapter one matthew chapter
[52:11] one
[52:12] the book of the generation of jesus
[52:16] christ the son of david
[52:20] the son of abraham is
[52:23] is amazing in a way that god
[52:26] inspired these men to write this book
[52:29] why would they put the son of david
[52:31] before the son of abraham when abraham
[52:33] was before david
[52:35] praise the lord but you see god
[52:39] god god is into acts
[52:42] like brother branham said brother
[52:44] branham says god is into us
[52:46] amen god is into music you know
[52:49] uh uh and the way that god
[52:53] write his word the way he give his word
[52:55] to us
[52:56] is is is a perfect at work
[53:00] a kind of a beautiful artwork but
[53:03] uh i i keep you thinking i'm dead why
[53:06] they had to put david before abraham
[53:08] that's not what i'm talking on this
[53:10] morning anyway praise the lord
[53:12] the book of the generation of jesus
[53:15] christ
[53:16] this caught my attention i spoke on this
[53:19] years back one time in south africa on
[53:22] the convention
[53:24] i was i was after a long time i've been
[53:27] there i
[53:28] went to do uh uh end of the year
[53:31] convention
[53:32] and uh you know and
[53:35] the brother coming to preach all the
[53:38] services
[53:39] which of course i never knew that was
[53:41] the way he said it
[53:42] and and then i told him i said i said
[53:45] brother
[53:46] i'm i'm tired you know he says well
[53:49] you just have to do it
[53:52] you know so one of the evening i decided
[53:56] to take this subject
[53:57] on the generation of jesus christ reveal
[54:02] and uh i don't know if i did a good job
[54:05] but
[54:06] uh but i all i can remember was that i
[54:09] was tired
[54:10] now if you if we read this you go
[54:13] through
[54:14] the the the names here as the scripture
[54:17] speaks about it
[54:18] abraham beget isaac and isaac begat
[54:21] jacob and jacob
[54:22] judah and his brethrens and you go down
[54:25] and you go down
[54:26] and you go down now
[54:30] [Music]
[54:32] in verse 16 and jacob beget
[54:35] joseph the husband of mary
[54:38] of whom was born
[54:41] jesus who is called the christ
[54:46] now look at verse 17 so all the
[54:49] generation from
[54:50] from abraham to david uh
[54:53] 14th generation now the scriptures here
[54:56] it is kind of opportunity right at the
[54:58] beginning
[54:59] the generation of jesus christ the son
[55:01] of david the son of abraham
[55:03] but when you come down here the bible
[55:06] says all the generation from abraham to
[55:08] david because that's the way
[55:10] it is 14th generation and from
[55:13] david on to the caring away
[55:16] unto babylon our 14th generation and
[55:20] from the carrying away into babylon
[55:24] onto christ's
[55:27] 14th generation then
[55:30] verse 18 stats now the
[55:34] birth of jesus is on this wise i thought
[55:36] verse 1 told
[55:38] us that this was the generation of jesus
[55:40] christ
[55:46] praise the lord
[55:50] matthew said this is the book of the
[55:52] generation of jesus christ
[55:54] but is giving us all of this generation
[55:57] unto
[55:57] jesus christ
[56:02] praise the lord i'll leave you hanging
[56:05] in there a little bit
[56:08] i know you won't fall
[56:13] praise the lord
[56:24] we will come back to matthew chapter one
[56:27] let's go to genesis chapter five
[56:32] genesis chapter five
[56:49] genesis chapter five there's a reason
[56:51] why
[56:53] i want us to look at this and sometimes
[56:56] you get caught up
[56:57] in all these you know uh presentation of
[57:01] the scripture and sometimes you
[57:03] you miss the purpose because it all
[57:05] becomes knowledge
[57:07] and the word really don't go home
[57:11] the purpose of the word of god is for
[57:14] the feeling of our souls is for the
[57:17] changing of our life the healing of our
[57:19] body
[57:20] the the deliverance from the things that
[57:23] are bothering us those sin that easily
[57:25] beset
[57:26] us the word of god must come all the
[57:27] time to deliver us
[57:29] but sometimes when we get into this
[57:32] china
[57:33] we only stick up here
[57:37] praise the lord and uh
[57:41] and it sounds like a wonderful ceremony
[57:43] sound wow i never saw this in the
[57:45] scripture that's beautiful
[57:47] but the reason why god wants you to see
[57:49] it
[57:50] is to be able to arm you against the
[57:52] enemy
[57:57] praise the lord genesis chapter 5
[58:01] verse 1. this is the book of the
[58:03] generation of adam
[58:05] in the day that god created
[58:08] man in the likeness
[58:12] of god made he him
[58:15] male and female created he did him
[58:19] and blessed him and called
[58:22] their names adam male and female but he
[58:25] called their names
[58:26] adam so right in there god perform a
[58:29] wedding
[58:29] praise the lord and that's the reason
[58:31] why adam could not put away his wife
[58:33] because they were already blessed
[58:35] under the marriage coveted that's
[58:37] another thing in that day
[58:39] when they were created and adam lived
[58:42] uh a hundred and thirty years in in
[58:45] and beget a son in his own image
[58:50] after his own i mean after
[58:53] his image and called his name set
[58:56] in the days of adam
[59:00] after he beget after he had begotten
[59:03] said
[59:05] were 800 years and he beget
[59:09] sons and daughters and all the days
[59:12] of our all the days that adam leave were
[59:16] 913
[59:18] years and he died now
[59:23] uh let me let me take another example
[59:26] here
[59:27] um genesis chapter 37
[59:31] let's look at genesis chapter 37
[59:36] now what i wanted to show in that
[59:37] scripture as we look at this other one
[59:40] is that
[59:40] when it comes to the generation and as
[59:43] the bible
[59:45] will play it out with different
[59:46] scripture the generation of a man would
[59:49] take him back to his father
[59:51] but what will happen is that it would
[59:53] come back to him
[59:54] and it would continue with him to his
[59:57] sons
[59:59] praise the lord so the generation of
[1:00:01] adam
[1:00:02] took us back to the beginning when god
[1:00:05] made man
[1:00:06] in his image praise the lord
[1:00:09] it bring us to adam and then it take
[1:00:12] us from adam to his sons
[1:00:16] praise the lord that's a man's
[1:00:19] generation
[1:00:21] but what we saw in matthew chapter 1
[1:00:24] as the generation of jesus it ends with
[1:00:28] jesus
[1:00:32] praise the lord it will have easily been
[1:00:36] the generation of
[1:00:37] of adam that end with jesus or the
[1:00:39] generation of david
[1:00:41] that end with jesus
[1:00:47] are we together praise the lord
[1:00:56] genesis 37
[1:01:05] i think what is happening here in the
[1:01:07] scripture
[1:01:08] yeah as the bible gave us this
[1:01:10] information
[1:01:12] uh the bible
[1:01:15] is uh we have to know that
[1:01:20] uh our bible came to us from a
[1:01:22] translation
[1:01:24] so i'm that i'm not translate i'm not a
[1:01:27] translator
[1:01:29] i'm just i'm just trying to show us
[1:01:32] something
[1:01:32] in the scripture but
[1:01:36] you know uh uh genesis chapter 37 let's
[1:01:40] look at this also these are the
[1:01:41] generation of jacob
[1:01:44] joseph being 17 years old
[1:01:50] was feeding the flock with his
[1:01:53] brethren's
[1:01:54] and and the lead
[1:01:58] was with the sons of bihar
[1:02:02] and with the sons of
[1:02:05] zelfer his father's wife and joseph
[1:02:09] brought unto his father
[1:02:10] their evil report now
[1:02:13] as as we look at this also if the
[1:02:16] generation
[1:02:17] of jacob is talking about joseph but is
[1:02:21] going to go through the sons of
[1:02:23] of of jacob is going to tell you know
[1:02:26] talk about all the sons of jacob
[1:02:28] and he's going to go on and on and on so
[1:02:31] uh what i want to wrap your attention on
[1:02:34] the year
[1:02:35] where we were actually see it in isaiah
[1:02:38] chapter 53
[1:02:42] isaiah chapter 53
[1:02:46] it's one of the sublime scripture
[1:02:49] in the bible
[1:03:01] isaiah chapter 53 actually there should
[1:03:04] have been my scripture reading this
[1:03:06] morning
[1:03:07] but uh
[1:03:18] this is a prophecy of our lord jesus and
[1:03:20] we all know that verse eight
[1:03:22] let's look at verse eight
[1:03:28] he was taken from praising and from
[1:03:31] judgment
[1:03:32] and woosha declared his generation
[1:03:37] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:03:41] the living
[1:03:42] for the transgression of my people was
[1:03:45] he struck him
[1:03:47] praise the lord so that's the reason why
[1:03:50] martial can give
[1:03:51] us a generation of jesus christ from
[1:03:53] abraham down to jesus and he cannot go
[1:03:56] any further
[1:03:59] because by profits a year his generation
[1:04:03] will not be declared
[1:04:07] we can declare his generation
[1:04:10] oh my goodness are we together
[1:04:14] praise the lord amen
[1:04:18] who can declare his generation for he
[1:04:21] was
[1:04:22] cut off out of the land of the living
[1:04:26] for the transgression of my people was
[1:04:28] he struck him
[1:04:32] verse 10
[1:04:37] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[1:04:43] he have put him to grief when thou
[1:04:48] shalt make his soul
[1:04:52] an offering for sin
[1:04:55] he shall see his seed
[1:05:02] now nobody will be able to declare his
[1:05:04] generation according to
[1:05:06] what isaiah said in prophecy but when he
[1:05:09] went
[1:05:09] farther he said after after he would
[1:05:12] make this
[1:05:14] offering of his sword
[1:05:17] then you will see his seed
[1:05:22] so the generation of jesus christ
[1:05:25] is going to be a spiritual birth
[1:05:30] that's that's the reason why we are born
[1:05:33] again by the sea
[1:05:34] incorruptible which is the word of god
[1:05:41] amen do you see what i'm going to this
[1:05:44] morning
[1:05:45] the generation of jesus christ is not
[1:05:48] it's not named after natural birth is
[1:05:52] not
[1:05:52] named just like the rest of the other
[1:05:55] generation
[1:05:56] is named in the scripture
[1:06:00] because he will be cut off from the land
[1:06:02] of the living
[1:06:04] after he has died for our transgression
[1:06:09] but when he have made an offering of his
[1:06:12] soul
[1:06:15] then that's when his generation will
[1:06:18] begin
[1:06:19] when his spirit comes back on earth like
[1:06:22] it did
[1:06:23] on the days of pentecost
[1:06:27] amen when his spirit comes back on earth
[1:06:32] when he get a people for his namesake
[1:06:37] when he gets when he get a church when
[1:06:39] he get a bride he get a people
[1:06:41] that he's he's dealing with your life
[1:06:44] he's living
[1:06:45] it's not a generation that we can name
[1:06:48] by
[1:06:48] tribe it's not a generation that we can
[1:06:51] name by denomination
[1:06:53] it's a generation that we can name by
[1:06:58] birth
[1:07:02] praise the lord amen amen it's a
[1:07:06] generation
[1:07:07] that we can name by birth
[1:07:16] are we together
[1:07:19] verse 10 and he pleased the lord to
[1:07:22] bruise him
[1:07:26] he have put him to grief when thou
[1:07:30] shalt make his soul an offering for sin
[1:07:35] he shall see his sea
[1:07:39] he shall prolong his
[1:07:43] days after
[1:07:46] he has made his soul an offering for sin
[1:07:52] then he will be able to bring birth
[1:07:56] and he will see his seed and he will
[1:07:58] prolong his days
[1:08:01] praise the lord amen
[1:08:04] amen
[1:08:08] and the pleasure of the lord
[1:08:11] shall prosper in his hands
[1:08:15] what what what up what a prophecy
[1:08:20] what a prophecy the thing that god
[1:08:24] desire the pleasure the reason why
[1:08:28] he created the word because paul said we
[1:08:32] are made for his pleasure
[1:08:35] the reason why he made a word the reason
[1:08:38] why
[1:08:39] he stepped down from the great internal
[1:08:41] spirit
[1:08:45] the reason why he allowed all of these
[1:08:48] things
[1:08:49] will prosper in his hands
[1:08:52] after he has made his soul an offering
[1:08:56] for sin
[1:09:00] and he will see his seed and he will
[1:09:03] prolong his days
[1:09:04] and the pleasure of the lord we prosper
[1:09:07] in his hands
[1:09:13] oh my praise the lord
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:21] are you ready this morning
[1:09:25] praise the lord what a prophecy
[1:09:30] now if you look also in luke chapter 3
[1:09:34] verse 23 it brings also
[1:09:37] the the generation of jesus christ which
[1:09:39] actually is the genealogy of jesus
[1:09:41] christ
[1:09:42] if we have to look at it that way but i
[1:09:44] don't want to go into that
[1:09:46] but what the what what what matthew did
[1:09:49] is the same thing that luke did it's
[1:09:52] just that they both take it in a
[1:09:54] different way
[1:09:55] matthew run the generation of jesus
[1:09:58] christ
[1:09:59] up to joseph was married
[1:10:02] mary and when luke did it luke
[1:10:05] also run the generation of jesus christ
[1:10:09] but it was more of mary's family
[1:10:14] so what what the two apostles were doing
[1:10:17] under the holy spirit is to show that
[1:10:20] both
[1:10:20] joseph and mary was in the bloodline of
[1:10:24] jesus christ
[1:10:26] so both joseph and mary they were chosen
[1:10:29] god
[1:10:30] watched over the blood traveling their
[1:10:33] bloodline to make sure
[1:10:34] that these both people are the right
[1:10:37] people
[1:10:38] to be in the lineage of jesus christ
[1:10:41] just matthew showed joseph in the
[1:10:44] lineage of jesus christ
[1:10:46] luke shaw married in the language of
[1:10:48] jesus christ
[1:10:50] because when abraham was looking for the
[1:10:52] bride for his son
[1:10:54] he said don't take her from anywhere
[1:10:56] else but god
[1:10:57] to my father's house
[1:11:01] rebecca has to be of the same bloodline
[1:11:06] the isaac came from
[1:11:09] are you seeing the picture so mary and
[1:11:12] joseph
[1:11:13] how to be in the bloodline of jesus
[1:11:16] christ
[1:11:21] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:11:23] before we call them our wife we first
[1:11:25] call them our sisters
[1:11:28] and we must respect them as our sisters
[1:11:31] because brother branham says the world
[1:11:32] will be your sisters you must respect
[1:11:34] them
[1:11:36] because it's the same bloodline
[1:11:40] amen
[1:11:43] are we together it's the same bloodline
[1:11:56] oh yellow my mind is spinning this
[1:12:00] morning
[1:12:02] but i want to stay i want to stay in my
[1:12:05] in mind now
[1:12:09] my subject this morning praise the lord
[1:12:12] amen so we see here
[1:12:16] that uh uh
[1:12:20] machiu is
[1:12:24] showing us of trying to speak about the
[1:12:27] generation of the of jesus christ
[1:12:29] but it does not he does not speak
[1:12:32] of anything that has to do with a seed
[1:12:35] that comes after jesus
[1:12:38] in every in every generation that you
[1:12:41] will read in the bible
[1:12:42] whether it was a generation of abraham
[1:12:45] or the generation of adam or of jacob
[1:12:48] all the different generation even their
[1:12:50] enormous chapter three the generation of
[1:12:52] of aaron and moses is spoken of
[1:12:56] but it speaks of their children
[1:13:00] it speaks of their offspring after it
[1:13:03] speaks of their father
[1:13:05] it comes to them and then it speaks of
[1:13:08] their offspring
[1:13:11] but when it comes to the generation of
[1:13:14] jesus christ
[1:13:16] it becomes a mystery it becomes
[1:13:20] something that is hating because it
[1:13:22] comes to jesus
[1:13:23] on this wise jesus was born and then it
[1:13:26] did not say anything again it just go
[1:13:28] into his life
[1:13:35] praise the lord amen amen
[1:13:39] now this will now help us to see
[1:13:43] and understand the revelation of jesus
[1:13:47] christ the important
[1:13:48] of that revelation the importance of
[1:13:52] that statement of that expression in
[1:13:55] revelation chapter 1
[1:13:59] why the holy spirit have to say it that
[1:14:02] way
[1:14:02] the revelation of jesus christ that god
[1:14:05] gave to him
[1:14:11] because in this revelation of jesus
[1:14:14] christ
[1:14:16] that's where we will see
[1:14:19] his generation
[1:14:25] his generation will be revealed
[1:14:28] in the revelation of jesus christ
[1:14:32] praise the lord amen
[1:14:36] i don't know what i've said i've started
[1:14:37] sweating
[1:14:39] feeling good amen praise the lord
[1:14:43] ah yeah yeah it looks like you are
[1:14:45] pulling more out of me than i'm even
[1:14:47] speaking amen
[1:14:49] because it looks like my inner chef
[1:14:51] starts to work this morning or maybe
[1:14:53] it's a little bit hot
[1:14:54] uh yeah but so let's let's just go ahead
[1:14:59] now
[1:14:59] as we were saying on on on on on
[1:15:02] wednesday night the revelation of jesus
[1:15:06] christ
[1:15:07] that god gave to him
[1:15:10] for him to show unto his servants
[1:15:14] the revelation of jesus christ that god
[1:15:17] gave
[1:15:18] to him remember we read this on
[1:15:21] wednesday night i go back to that again
[1:15:24] question and answer on genesis
[1:15:26] and uh
[1:15:31] it's pretty much the same code i just i
[1:15:33] just added another one there the
[1:15:36] uh sister faith but it's
[1:15:39] yeah i just kind of repeated here's the
[1:15:42] message we have
[1:15:43] jesus was jehovah
[1:15:47] in building flesh come down in veil now
[1:15:50] god
[1:15:51] father son and holy ghost is not like
[1:15:55] your finger one
[1:15:59] like some people think
[1:16:03] the whole thing i i just unfolded to you
[1:16:07] a while ago
[1:16:10] that there's a trinity in
[1:16:14] the one i'm a trinity
[1:16:17] in one i'm so body and spirit
[1:16:20] in one person
[1:16:24] and everything you look at is in the
[1:16:27] trinity
[1:16:28] and a trinity in one there is a trinity
[1:16:32] in the act the bottom floor where the
[1:16:35] creeping things were the second floor
[1:16:37] was the flowers the flying things and
[1:16:39] the terraflow was nowhere in his family
[1:16:43] in the tabernacle there was a
[1:16:45] congregation
[1:16:46] a holy place and the holiest of holy so
[1:16:48] it's just three compartments
[1:16:50] but that is not with god amen
[1:16:54] god is one year old
[1:16:57] israel the lord our god is one
[1:17:02] amen he's not three person in one he's
[1:17:05] one person
[1:17:06] manifesting himself
[1:17:12] he manifested himself in three different
[1:17:15] offices
[1:17:17] are we together and the reason why
[1:17:20] is because of the greatness
[1:17:25] of our god that's the reason why we
[1:17:28] cannot reduce him
[1:17:30] to a denomination or to a church god is
[1:17:33] great
[1:17:38] are we together and this great god
[1:17:43] there is no way that we could
[1:17:47] comprehend him we could understand him
[1:17:51] he has to deal with us by dispensation
[1:17:55] and different
[1:17:56] manifestation for us to be able to
[1:17:59] understand him
[1:18:06] are we together
[1:18:23] so we see the tabernacle there there
[1:18:26] there are three
[1:18:27] places there then and and and and
[1:18:30] there's been three dispensations
[1:18:32] fatherhood sonship and the holy spirit
[1:18:35] dispensation
[1:18:36] see what i mean what we don't say
[1:18:40] our gods that's hidden
[1:18:44] and the jews know that but when you can
[1:18:47] make it to him that this
[1:18:50] jesus is god jehovah god
[1:18:54] not as not a second person or a third
[1:18:57] person
[1:18:58] is the same person all the time
[1:19:02] making himself manifest amen
[1:19:06] is the same person all the time
[1:19:09] manifesting himself breaking himself
[1:19:12] down
[1:19:13] amen praise the lord just so
[1:19:18] we can be able to understand him
[1:19:22] we can have an idea of the god that we
[1:19:25] watch it
[1:19:32] are we together
[1:19:37] even though the lord our god
[1:19:41] is one but not just one
[1:19:45] as my standing finger
[1:19:50] amen it's supposed to be
[1:19:54] in my mind i can say the lord our god is
[1:20:02] great
[1:20:04] not so much in his power but
[1:20:07] so much of who he is
[1:20:12] praise the lord so much of who he
[1:20:15] is just to know that right now
[1:20:19] as we are sitting down right now as you
[1:20:21] are sitting down
[1:20:22] listening to the sound of my voice god
[1:20:25] knows
[1:20:26] what you're thinking in your mind he
[1:20:28] knows how much your heart is beating
[1:20:30] he knows the number of the head on your
[1:20:32] head he even numbers them
[1:20:35] when the scripture says he numbers then
[1:20:37] does not means that he count then you
[1:20:38] know which one is one you know which one
[1:20:40] is two amen
[1:20:49] he knows how your mind is running he
[1:20:51] knows what you're thinking right now as
[1:20:53] you are sitting down and looking at me
[1:20:57] that's how great our god is
[1:21:06] there is nothing that is happening that
[1:21:09] he is
[1:21:09] absent from
[1:21:13] there is nothing that is happening now
[1:21:15] that he's absent from innocence that he
[1:21:18] does not know about
[1:21:28] that's the reason why paul says it's a
[1:21:30] fearful thing to fall in the hands of
[1:21:32] the living god
[1:21:36] it's a fearful thing
[1:21:39] to think that we have a secret in our
[1:21:43] life that nobody knows about
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:49] it's a fearful thing because there is
[1:21:52] nothing you can hide from god
[1:21:58] there is nothing you can hide from him
[1:22:01] there is not even a flea that can move
[1:22:03] without god maury
[1:22:10] that's how great he is
[1:22:16] that's how great and and and that is the
[1:22:19] greatness
[1:22:20] that he's pulling us into i would tell
[1:22:23] you that this
[1:22:24] age among all the ages because
[1:22:28] since this is the age where his days was
[1:22:32] going to be prolonged and his siege was
[1:22:34] going to be manifested
[1:22:36] this is the age this is the age
[1:22:39] where god brought his greatness so close
[1:22:43] to us
[1:22:47] praise the lord
[1:22:50] in the ministry of a prophet
[1:22:59] and that prophet ministry that same gift
[1:23:02] that was standing behind the pulpit that
[1:23:04] could tell people their names
[1:23:06] and things that happened to them when
[1:23:08] they were a little boy
[1:23:10] that a little child that same gift
[1:23:12] called the holy spirit
[1:23:14] is here this morning that is the god
[1:23:18] that we serve
[1:23:25] he knows when your habit begins
[1:23:28] he knows what he runs down talk not only
[1:23:31] that he knows
[1:23:32] but he knows
[1:23:37] the kill
[1:23:41] and he's able to deliver us amen
[1:23:49] are we together amen
[1:23:54] i'm trying to pull away from from from
[1:23:56] this mystery of godliness and we could
[1:23:58] run through scriptures here
[1:24:00] and and spin our mind and become so
[1:24:02] excited
[1:24:03] i'm trying to draw back and bring us the
[1:24:06] reality
[1:24:09] that we are not just playing church
[1:24:14] amen
[1:24:19] we are not just playing church
[1:24:24] we are in the presence of the almighty
[1:24:28] god
[1:24:34] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:24:37] in the presence of almighty god
[1:24:55] that same god
[1:24:58] that created the heaven and the earth
[1:25:01] amen that same god
[1:25:05] has began a new creation in you
[1:25:09] and myself
[1:25:12] and that is god's concern you see god
[1:25:16] watching over your life and he and he
[1:25:18] protecting you
[1:25:19] and he's providing for you is because of
[1:25:22] his creation
[1:25:23] the new creation that he has started in
[1:25:38] you
[1:25:40] are we together
[1:25:43] that's that is the reality
[1:25:48] that is the reality that that uh
[1:25:51] that that the devil tried to hold back
[1:25:53] from us
[1:25:58] he tried to hold back that reality from
[1:26:00] us if he can give
[1:26:02] us three gods a great one in heaven
[1:26:06] a lesser one that came and died and set
[1:26:09] him down by his father
[1:26:11] feeling sorry for us oh father forgive
[1:26:13] them
[1:26:15] and and and and and the holy spirit
[1:26:18] that we that that that we think we have
[1:26:21] we have control over because we have the
[1:26:23] holy spirit
[1:26:24] no he have us
[1:26:29] he redeemed us he possesses us
[1:26:37] amen amen
[1:26:40] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:26:45] that god gave to him
[1:26:49] oh there's just a lot of things we can
[1:26:51] go into this morning
[1:26:53] i was thinking about that yesterday
[1:26:54] while i was studying
[1:26:56] my mind was thinking about you know why
[1:26:58] brother branham called michael
[1:27:00] as there are places where he referred to
[1:27:02] michael the angel michael that's christ
[1:27:05] and and i would just start i was just
[1:27:07] trying to go back
[1:27:08] into all of that you know just like when
[1:27:10] we signed the song what almighty god we
[1:27:12] self you know angels by before him
[1:27:15] yeah and and brother branham tell us you
[1:27:17] know for god to become god he has to
[1:27:19] have something to worship him
[1:27:21] and he and he created the angels to
[1:27:24] worship him in the beginning
[1:27:26] but they were now worshiping him in in
[1:27:29] the form of the great intent of spirit
[1:27:31] because a worship is not complete until
[1:27:34] you have an
[1:27:34] image that you are worshiping
[1:27:39] amen so he became the image
[1:27:42] of the invisible god collusion chapter
[1:27:46] one he was the image
[1:27:50] of the invisible god
[1:27:58] and that image was not like something
[1:28:01] that is make
[1:28:02] unto god you see that's the reason why
[1:28:04] when brother branham said
[1:28:06] that that that adam was an amateur god
[1:28:09] and god made man in his image
[1:28:12] is not like you know god is here and he
[1:28:15] made something
[1:28:16] that looks like him no he made something
[1:28:19] that he can express
[1:28:20] himself true the
[1:28:23] image of god is something that god can
[1:28:25] express himself through
[1:28:28] something he can come endured in and
[1:28:31] give
[1:28:31] us an idea of who he is
[1:28:38] it's not god making image like man make
[1:28:41] image
[1:28:41] a man can make an image that look like
[1:28:43] to him michael
[1:28:45] angelo he makes an image that looks like
[1:28:47] onto a more
[1:28:48] like onto moses but when god makes an
[1:28:51] image it's something that god made and
[1:28:54] he expresses himself through that thing
[1:28:57] hallelujah yes that's the image of god
[1:29:02] yes yes and that is the only reason why
[1:29:06] adam can be an amateur god because god
[1:29:09] was expressing himself through others
[1:29:15] praise the lord
[1:29:20] are we together amen so the revelation
[1:29:26] of jesus christ that god gave to him
[1:29:32] when god
[1:29:36] let's let's read collusion chapter one
[1:29:44] i don't want to do a go-head teaching
[1:29:46] but it's just hard to be able to bring
[1:29:50] bring out the subject without going into
[1:29:53] this
[1:29:55] but i'm sure the lord is going to help
[1:29:57] us amen
[1:29:59] he knows where our heart is
[1:30:02] he knows what we are trying to labor
[1:30:04] under this morning
[1:30:06] praise the lord amen
[1:30:17] if you read from from verse one this is
[1:30:20] all talking about christ
[1:30:22] you know uh paul is talking about christ
[1:30:25] in an amazing way here but verse 15
[1:30:27] will bring us to the place uh
[1:30:31] verse 12 giving thanks unto the father
[1:30:35] which have made us meet to be
[1:30:38] partakers of the inheritance of the sins
[1:30:41] in light
[1:30:43] who have delivered us from the power of
[1:30:46] darkness
[1:30:47] and has translated us into the kingdom
[1:30:50] of his dear son in whom we have
[1:30:54] redemption
[1:30:55] through his blood even the forgiveness
[1:30:57] of our sin
[1:30:58] now you see what some sometimes these
[1:31:00] things are important is because
[1:31:02] when we come on the subject of the
[1:31:04] godhead
[1:31:05] in some ways it make us to feel that we
[1:31:09] have a superior knowledge of of the word
[1:31:11] of god
[1:31:12] and the denomination are in darkness
[1:31:13] because they believe in trinity
[1:31:17] that's not the purpose of the godhead
[1:31:20] the
[1:31:21] purpose of the godhead is to take you
[1:31:23] from the kingdom of darkness
[1:31:25] and put you in the kingdom of light
[1:31:28] for us to be the light of the world is
[1:31:31] god
[1:31:32] getting the hold of our life is not just
[1:31:35] to give you our
[1:31:35] understanding that jesus is god and we
[1:31:38] just stick with that
[1:31:44] praise the lord
[1:31:48] the purpose of the of the godhead
[1:31:58] is to be able to take us from the
[1:32:00] kingdom of darkness
[1:32:04] if god the creator of the universe
[1:32:08] if god is one if we have this
[1:32:10] understanding if it's the true god that
[1:32:12] we are worshiping then we will not be
[1:32:13] bound by change
[1:32:16] we must not be enslaved by habits
[1:32:19] we must not be uh uh uh uh you know
[1:32:23] being subjected to to defeat and fear
[1:32:30] that's the purpose of the godhead
[1:32:37] because what god trying to reveal to us
[1:32:40] is that you are the body
[1:32:44] you are the one now i have redeemed
[1:32:49] to be able to reflect myself true
[1:32:52] to be able to leave myself true are we
[1:32:55] together
[1:32:56] now so paul goes here and he says
[1:33:00] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:33:05] the firstborn of every creature that was
[1:33:08] the first thing that god made
[1:33:14] in one sense was to give birth to
[1:33:16] himself
[1:33:17] in another sense what to convince
[1:33:20] himself
[1:33:22] into a body of light
[1:33:25] that we call the logos in the beginning
[1:33:28] was the word
[1:33:28] the word was with god
[1:33:32] because this great invisible god
[1:33:35] the great internal spirit
[1:33:39] we cannot comprehend him his ways are
[1:33:42] past finding out
[1:33:48] praise the lord to know that
[1:33:52] he's in our midst this morning
[1:33:55] he's in our midst but yet he has
[1:33:58] given us a channel through which we can
[1:34:01] hear through him
[1:34:03] god is in our midst this morning it
[1:34:05] takes nothing
[1:34:06] for him to speak in this building and
[1:34:09] for everybody to hear him
[1:34:12] it takes nothing for god to do that this
[1:34:15] morning
[1:34:16] as i'm speaking to you it takes nothing
[1:34:18] for god to speak
[1:34:20] audibly
[1:34:23] but you see in his greatness
[1:34:26] he takes a channel
[1:34:32] because one time he tried the people say
[1:34:34] no speak to moses
[1:34:38] and let moses speak to us
[1:34:45] the god that created the universe the
[1:34:47] one that woke us up this morning
[1:34:50] the one that gave us birth in our body
[1:34:52] that we are breathing
[1:34:53] we are in his midst we are in his
[1:34:56] presence
[1:34:59] amen
[1:35:10] he's the image of the invisible god
[1:35:14] the one that the invisible god expresses
[1:35:18] itself through
[1:35:25] for by him were all things created
[1:35:28] that are in heaven and that are in the
[1:35:31] earth visible
[1:35:32] invisible whether they be troons
[1:35:35] whether they be dominion whether they be
[1:35:37] principalities
[1:35:40] everything was created by him
[1:35:44] can you think about it a god
[1:35:48] that created his own adversary
[1:35:52] only to show that he's god
[1:35:57] what a dominion whether power
[1:36:01] principality everything was created by
[1:36:03] him
[1:36:06] all things were created by him and for
[1:36:09] him
[1:36:11] amen and he is before
[1:36:14] all things and by him all things
[1:36:18] consist
[1:36:22] praise the lord that's that's the
[1:36:25] greatness
[1:36:28] and you know brother branham
[1:36:31] show us that the greatness of god
[1:36:35] is manifested in three ways
[1:36:40] as an only present god
[1:36:44] a god that is everywhere
[1:36:51] amen
[1:37:00] the omnipresent god
[1:37:03] and how many sins god that knows
[1:37:05] everything
[1:37:08] and an omnipotent god
[1:37:12] that has the power of everything
[1:37:15] that's that's the greatness of god
[1:37:18] that's been revealed to us
[1:37:19] in this hour
[1:37:23] the one that we are worshiping the one
[1:37:27] that we pray to
[1:37:31] is a god that
[1:37:35] he has the power
[1:37:41] praise the lord amen
[1:37:58] lord show us the father and he suffices
[1:38:01] us now my parents
[1:38:05] both before we were catholic my brother
[1:38:08] you see
[1:38:09] there's not much cattle left in me
[1:38:12] as as the triangle
[1:38:17] that's right yes they believe in their
[1:38:21] internal sunshine all
[1:38:25] uh there's three actual individual being
[1:38:29] god the father an old man with a long
[1:38:35] white beard god the son a middle-aged
[1:38:39] man
[1:38:41] and the holy ghost asks
[1:38:44] a mascot boy like there is no such thing
[1:38:50] there is only one god
[1:38:56] and i differently agreed
[1:38:59] with the organization of of penny custer
[1:39:04] that called the oneness like
[1:39:07] your finger is one
[1:39:11] that's wrong absolutely wrong
[1:39:15] jesus couldn't have been his own father
[1:39:20] and if god is a man then jesus
[1:39:25] was born sexually desired and not a
[1:39:28] virgin birth
[1:39:30] that said to the whole thing you see if
[1:39:33] he's one like your finger
[1:39:35] then what
[1:39:38] then he
[1:39:41] was his own daddy
[1:39:45] how could he have been that's wrong
[1:39:48] he's the father amen
[1:39:56] praise the lord
[1:40:02] great is the mystery of god reveal
[1:40:18] that's the greatness red brand i mean
[1:40:22] is this the time he says that was one of
[1:40:24] the mystery of god that was he'll honor
[1:40:26] the seals
[1:40:29] and we know all of those mysteries that
[1:40:30] were here under the seals were for the
[1:40:32] bribe redemption
[1:40:37] and god has revealed those mysteries in
[1:40:40] this day
[1:40:44] you see that's the reason why even with
[1:40:46] the message of the hour
[1:40:48] and and and all that god has given us in
[1:40:51] this age
[1:40:52] sometimes it's is it it just looks like
[1:40:56] you know uh like like brother branham
[1:40:58] says when when
[1:40:59] and you know when uh when the bride
[1:41:01] would find her place the rapture would
[1:41:02] go
[1:41:05] it's because even in some of these
[1:41:06] things
[1:41:09] we have the mystery of god we understand
[1:41:12] the revelation of god
[1:41:13] jesus christ is god but what are we
[1:41:16] doing with that
[1:41:16] even with those things in our hands
[1:41:20] the devil is still pounding our heads
[1:41:28] like brother branham said he says the
[1:41:29] name of jesus is just like
[1:41:32] the stick that moses had amen
[1:41:36] amen it's just like that roar he had in
[1:41:40] his hands
[1:41:40] when he stepped down there before before
[1:41:43] pharaoh knowing that they were the
[1:41:44] greatest army in the world
[1:41:47] but he could step down there in the name
[1:41:50] of jesus he could step down there in the
[1:41:53] name
[1:41:53] of the i am that i am
[1:41:58] and he was not afraid
[1:42:01] because he knew he has come in the
[1:42:03] presence of almighty god
[1:42:06] and that presence was going with him
[1:42:10] we know that brother branham sent us a
[1:42:12] prophet i mean god sent us a prophet
[1:42:14] brother branham was god's prophet
[1:42:16] we know that jesus christ is god we know
[1:42:18] we
[1:42:19] we have all of these things all is wrong
[1:42:21] to do this
[1:42:22] it's wrong to do we have all of them but
[1:42:25] yet with everything that god has
[1:42:27] equipped
[1:42:28] us with we are still living in fear
[1:42:32] we are still being tolerated by the
[1:42:40] devil
[1:42:45] that's the reason why young people we
[1:42:47] don't just want to bring you to an
[1:42:48] understanding we don't want to bring you
[1:42:50] just to a hair knowledge amen
[1:42:54] but we're trying to say there is power
[1:42:56] in this world
[1:42:59] amen there is power in this world
[1:43:02] if you just love the word for it to live
[1:43:05] through
[1:43:05] you then just seeking to know the word
[1:43:09] it's two different things amen
[1:43:13] seeking to know the word seeking to
[1:43:14] understand that god has seeking to
[1:43:16] understand this
[1:43:17] is just like you going to your
[1:43:18] university
[1:43:22] amen
[1:43:27] surprised me that uh we we go to higher
[1:43:30] institutions to become smart
[1:43:32] and people go there to learn to be smart
[1:43:36] and be better
[1:43:38] and it starts to do foolish things
[1:43:43] amen they place the wind to be smart and
[1:43:46] better
[1:43:48] it's the very same place they stay they
[1:43:50] start piercing their ear they start
[1:43:52] smoking they start doing things that
[1:43:53] they're not supposed to do
[1:43:56] [Applause]
[1:44:00] have the church not become the same
[1:44:02] thing we have come to this place in our
[1:44:04] age with the mystery of
[1:44:06] god reveal with god with what we have
[1:44:09] done in our age
[1:44:11] and we still sit under this word
[1:44:16] with fascists and gracious and
[1:44:18] bitterness
[1:44:25] and we put brother branham tapes on we
[1:44:27] listen to the message we hear the
[1:44:29] discernment
[1:44:31] all of those things just excite our mind
[1:44:33] the purpose of this world
[1:44:35] is to be able to live through us to give
[1:44:37] you a
[1:44:38] daily victorious life
[1:44:42] amen
[1:44:45] to give us a dealing victorious life
[1:44:50] that's the reason why john can say this
[1:44:52] young people greater is he that is in
[1:44:54] you
[1:44:55] than he that is in the world
[1:45:01] because on the island of patmos that's
[1:45:03] what he saw
[1:45:05] he saw the revelation of jesus christ he
[1:45:08] saw the one that was standing in the
[1:45:10] midst of seven golden candlesticks
[1:45:12] he saw the one that was revealing to
[1:45:14] john who is the first horse rather
[1:45:16] who is the second horse rather and the
[1:45:18] one that was doing it was jesus christ
[1:45:22] and he's the one that is doing
[1:45:24] everything in his church
[1:45:26] he's the one that is helping us to
[1:45:27] overcome he's the one that is changing
[1:45:30] our lives he's the one that is bringing
[1:45:32] us closer to him
[1:45:33] he's the one moving in the seven bowling
[1:45:36] candlesticks in the midst of the seven
[1:45:38] golden candlesticks
[1:45:39] it's jesus and jesus alone
[1:45:45] amen this revelation
[1:45:52] this revelation of jesus christ
[1:45:58] that god gave unto him
[1:46:01] right from the beginning right from the
[1:46:04] beginning the invisible spirit
[1:46:06] given to him as the firstborn
[1:46:10] of everything
[1:46:15] that's the reason why from genesis
[1:46:19] to revelation you remember when when
[1:46:22] samson parents
[1:46:24] met that angel manoa and his wife
[1:46:30] they said we will we will make a
[1:46:32] sacrifice
[1:46:34] an angel came
[1:46:37] and he says well what should we say
[1:46:41] is the one that have taught us these
[1:46:43] things
[1:46:45] the angel said to them
[1:46:48] behold my name is secret right amen
[1:46:54] they felt on their faces oh we have seen
[1:46:57] god
[1:46:59] with our eyes
[1:47:03] through the ages he's been revealing
[1:47:06] himself
[1:47:08] little by little little by little
[1:47:12] amen
[1:47:17] when he came and took on flesh
[1:47:20] that's when he was giving a human name
[1:47:26] jesus brother branham explained it this
[1:47:30] way
[1:47:30] it's like two men going to uh uh go into
[1:47:33] the ocean
[1:47:34] to go and and test the great seed and
[1:47:37] see
[1:47:37] all the component that is in it and one
[1:47:40] man take a whole
[1:47:41] business fill it up and another person
[1:47:44] just go with a spoon
[1:47:48] he says whatever element that guy that
[1:47:51] took the whole truck
[1:47:52] fought will get the one with the spoon
[1:47:56] will get the same
[1:48:02] amen
[1:48:04] jesus was the truck for the fullness of
[1:48:07] god
[1:48:09] was in him amen
[1:48:12] praise the lord amen the fullness of god
[1:48:15] was in him
[1:48:16] amen and you and myself we are just a
[1:48:19] spoonful
[1:48:21] i'm just a teaspoonful
[1:48:25] amen but the same element
[1:48:30] the same element
[1:48:38] praise the lord are we together
[1:48:43] the revelation of jesus christ is more
[1:48:45] than
[1:48:46] a doctrine
[1:48:50] it's more than a doctrine it's more than
[1:48:51] the teaching is more than what we can
[1:48:53] argue about that jesus is god and jesus
[1:48:56] is not god and
[1:48:57] i mean and and there is no trinity
[1:49:00] and sometimes we just we just get so
[1:49:02] arrogant about it
[1:49:09] even our lord jesus
[1:49:13] when he was here on earth the fullness
[1:49:16] of god
[1:49:16] dwelling in him you never see jesus
[1:49:19] going down
[1:49:20] to the synagogues to argue with the
[1:49:22] pharisees i'm your god
[1:49:26] i'm your god the god you are worshiping
[1:49:28] he's in me
[1:49:29] he never did that
[1:49:33] what he did was
[1:49:41] he says you know the son can do nothing
[1:49:45] except the father revealed to him amen
[1:49:49] amen he says the son can do nothing
[1:49:52] except the father reveal it to him
[1:49:59] he was trying to help them to see that
[1:50:02] is the mighty god
[1:50:03] expressing himself
[1:50:08] kind of changed a little bit from
[1:50:09] wednesday night but that's the thing i
[1:50:11] was thinking about
[1:50:12] yesterday i said lord let it let this
[1:50:14] just now turn out to be
[1:50:16] you know a kind of a just just a good
[1:50:18] semi let it not just turn out to be
[1:50:20] a a mystical things just to get the
[1:50:23] people excited
[1:50:25] but let's realize
[1:50:29] that the reason why god has opened your
[1:50:31] eyes
[1:50:33] to see
[1:50:37] these things
[1:50:42] is because he wants to reveal himself he
[1:50:45] wants to express himself through you
[1:50:47] he wants you to be an ambassador of
[1:50:50] christ he wants you
[1:50:52] to represent him amen
[1:50:56] let your lie so shine that man will see
[1:51:00] your good work
[1:51:01] and glorify your father
[1:51:06] in heaven praise the lord
[1:51:10] amen i can read
[1:51:14] quotes to you this morning that will
[1:51:19] that will make the head to stand on your
[1:51:21] shoulder when brad branham talks
[1:51:23] about what god is doing in the church
[1:51:27] i mean the the position of the church
[1:51:30] and the things that he has ordained for
[1:51:32] us in this age
[1:51:35] when he says the body of jesus is just a
[1:51:37] memorial
[1:51:40] before the father the actual body
[1:51:43] is this body on earth
[1:51:47] that is the reason why when paul was
[1:51:49] persecuting the church
[1:51:52] he says paul why are you persecuting me
[1:51:54] saul why are you persecuting me
[1:51:59] because that was his body on earth
[1:52:05] amen that was his body on earth
[1:52:09] and those are some of the things what
[1:52:11] jesus was trying to tell the disciples
[1:52:14] you can say anything about the son of
[1:52:16] man it will be forgiving you
[1:52:19] he says but when he comes in the form of
[1:52:22] his church
[1:52:24] one word spoken against it
[1:52:28] because the church is a mystical body
[1:52:32] god brings us from different family he
[1:52:35] brings
[1:52:36] us from different background and
[1:52:37] sometimes from different church
[1:52:39] teachings and he brings us
[1:52:42] into this body amen
[1:52:49] and we need to grab that revelation to
[1:52:51] appreciate
[1:52:52] what his grace is doing in our life grab
[1:52:55] that revelation to appreciate
[1:52:57] you know what he's doing in our midst
[1:53:03] appreciate the people that he has put
[1:53:05] around us
[1:53:08] sometimes the way that we we are we get
[1:53:11] sometimes uh caught up in either in the
[1:53:13] national spirit or in a tribal spirit
[1:53:15] that's the same way sometimes we do with
[1:53:17] church
[1:53:19] we get stuck so so much to our our old
[1:53:22] church
[1:53:23] ways and all church belief is hard for
[1:53:25] us to to find ourselves
[1:53:28] being fruitful
[1:53:31] where god place us
[1:53:37] praise the lord as a son of god as a
[1:53:40] daughter of god no matter where you go
[1:53:42] and you find yourself among believers
[1:53:47] as a child of god you must be able to
[1:53:49] rightly fit in
[1:53:51] as a one that loved the lord
[1:53:59] the revelation of jesus christ that god
[1:54:02] gave unto him
[1:54:06] now the bride
[1:54:09] is the continuation of that revelation
[1:54:12] he's continuing continuing that
[1:54:14] revelation
[1:54:15] in our life
[1:54:21] when he has offered his soul as an
[1:54:23] offering for sin then he will see his
[1:54:25] seeds
[1:54:27] why because brother branham says all
[1:54:29] that god
[1:54:30] was he pulled into christ
[1:54:34] and all that christ was he pulled
[1:54:37] into the church on the dead of pentecost
[1:54:40] because
[1:54:40] that's word amen
[1:54:44] that's where his generation started from
[1:54:56] praise the lord amen because
[1:55:00] if we could just continue in the
[1:55:02] alliance
[1:55:04] that matthew chapter one gave us what
[1:55:06] will happen here is that
[1:55:08] we will get stuck because it will just
[1:55:11] go
[1:55:11] completely in the jewish lineage and you
[1:55:14] and myself will be left out
[1:55:19] praise the lord
[1:55:25] by the gen the generation of jesus
[1:55:27] christ
[1:55:28] he see the ones that he had brought
[1:55:31] forth by his
[1:55:32] own life by spilling his blood it's you
[1:55:35] and myself
[1:55:38] amen that's the reason why the church is
[1:55:41] made out of
[1:55:42] jews gentiles samaritans by one blood
[1:55:45] god
[1:55:45] save all men that's right
[1:55:51] those are the things that he was trying
[1:55:52] to tell the disciples i have
[1:55:54] some other sheeps that are not part of
[1:55:56] this fort
[1:55:58] i have to go by the way of samira
[1:56:02] praise the lord that's why he gave
[1:56:06] us a gentile dispensation
[1:56:11] because we are all from one father
[1:56:15] amen we are all can can find ourselves
[1:56:19] in the genealogy of jesus christ
[1:56:25] praise the lord you read it right there
[1:56:29] in matthew chapter one
[1:56:31] that is one of the place you will ever
[1:56:33] see it
[1:56:34] in a scripture where names of women were
[1:56:37] put in the
[1:56:39] energy knowledge
[1:56:43] it talks about tema it talks about rehab
[1:56:47] it talks about ruth it also talks about
[1:56:50] the wife of
[1:56:52] uriah's belt shiver and they were all
[1:56:56] gentile women
[1:57:01] praise the lord but they were placed
[1:57:05] there to show
[1:57:09] the mystery that is around this
[1:57:11] generation of jesus christ
[1:57:13] that is not just a jewish church it's
[1:57:16] not just a jewish generation
[1:57:20] it's a generation that will be made out
[1:57:22] of all people from around the world
[1:57:27] praise the lord
[1:57:31] amen
[1:57:34] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:57:35] word was with god and the world was god
[1:57:38] let's just take another uh thought here
[1:57:40] to brother brennan
[1:57:42] hebrew chapter four we read a little bit
[1:57:44] of that look
[1:57:46] look like people could see that and that
[1:57:50] argue
[1:57:54] okay i have to close here
[1:57:59] certainly god is not three person
[1:58:03] if he is three god then we are hiddens
[1:58:07] which one is god they are
[1:58:10] all three one god
[1:58:17] is three offices of the same god
[1:58:21] he was the father
[1:58:24] in the form of the holy spirit the
[1:58:27] pillar of fire in the wilderness
[1:58:30] he was the son when he used the sonship
[1:58:34] office a little while and the world
[1:58:37] would see me no more
[1:58:39] i will go away i would come again and be
[1:58:42] with you
[1:58:43] even in you told the end of the world
[1:58:47] see he's the father who the sonship the
[1:58:51] holy ghost
[1:58:52] to is all the very same god
[1:58:55] working in three different offices
[1:58:59] father who sonship holy ghost saint john
[1:59:02] 5 7.
[1:59:06] now so over and over he's trying to help
[1:59:09] us to see
[1:59:11] one god manifesting in three offices
[1:59:14] that that we know
[1:59:16] amen but it was a great revelation like
[1:59:20] paul says great is the mystery of
[1:59:22] godliness
[1:59:24] it was a great revelation
[1:59:29] and it was not only for information
[1:59:32] but it was a revelation that should be
[1:59:35] laid through
[1:59:35] us
[1:59:41] a revelation that should be laid through
[1:59:43] us
[1:59:45] paul talks about the church coming to
[1:59:47] the image of christ
[1:59:49] just like christ was the image of god
[1:59:55] a revelation that should be lived
[1:59:57] through us to know
[1:59:59] that we have been purchased by his blood
[2:00:10] praise the lord to know that we are a
[2:00:14] son and daughter of god what what a
[2:00:16] greatest privilege we can have in the
[2:00:18] word
[2:00:20] what is the greatest calling that we can
[2:00:22] have
[2:00:25] but you see this age laudisha has
[2:00:28] reduced god to material things
[2:00:32] amen that the thing is the car that the
[2:00:35] drive that make them son of god or the
[2:00:36] house that they live in that make them
[2:00:38] children of god
[2:00:39] or how much money they have that make
[2:00:41] them children of god
[2:00:43] right it's the redemption
[2:00:47] it's what he is doing in our life
[2:00:52] amen
[2:01:02] the revelation of jesus christ
[2:01:05] that god gave unto him
[2:01:09] and he has given that revelation unto us
[2:01:13] unto the church
[2:01:18] amen you see that's that's the reason
[2:01:20] why right there in revelation chapter
[2:01:21] one
[2:01:22] brother peter referred that referred to
[2:01:24] that last uh
[2:01:26] last week and uh brother branham says
[2:01:29] when he stepped out of that pre-school
[2:01:30] office
[2:01:31] he took uh uh uh you know he took uh
[2:01:36] uh how you call it now his build and
[2:01:38] then he put it over his pipes
[2:01:40] at the first brother branham says he
[2:01:41] says that was christ in the bride form
[2:01:45] amen and then he took a father
[2:01:51] and he says that's christ in the
[2:01:53] priesthood
[2:01:54] office
[2:01:58] so it's that priest who offers that we
[2:02:00] are caught up
[2:02:03] to make intercession to bring
[2:02:06] daily sacrifice
[2:02:09] onto god daily sacrifice we can go every
[2:02:12] day
[2:02:16] bringing worship to our god
[2:02:21] praise the lord amen if we miss that
[2:02:25] church
[2:02:28] if we miss that if we miss the
[2:02:30] revelation of jesus christ that we are
[2:02:32] called to
[2:02:34] just like i said not just an
[2:02:35] understanding beautiful you understand
[2:02:37] you know that god god revealed it to you
[2:02:39] you can see it clearly
[2:02:41] but the purpose of that is for you to be
[2:02:45] the revelation
[2:02:47] it's for that revelation to live through
[2:02:49] you
[2:02:55] to be a witness in a dying world
[2:03:00] or to be able to reach out and bring
[2:03:02] other
[2:03:03] seeds of god because
[2:03:07] that's what the seed of god is attracted
[2:03:10] to
[2:03:10] is the revelation of jesus christ
[2:03:17] if your friend is a seed of god or your
[2:03:20] neighbor is a seed of god
[2:03:22] what they are attracted to is the
[2:03:24] revelation of jesus christ when he
[2:03:26] starts to see
[2:03:27] that revelation living out through your
[2:03:29] life
[2:03:30] this is why you are different there's
[2:03:33] something about you
[2:03:35] praise the lord amen
[2:03:41] well sometimes we we we
[2:03:44] we we quickly want to tell them about a
[2:03:47] prophet
[2:03:49] or we want to tell them about which
[2:03:51] church we go stone no
[2:03:53] tell them about the christ
[2:03:57] the christ that has redeemed you
[2:04:03] tell them about christ i was not born
[2:04:05] this way
[2:04:09] i i was not born this i've been saved
[2:04:12] god changed my life
[2:04:17] because if you're talking about a church
[2:04:19] they would just think that the church is
[2:04:21] abusing you because
[2:04:22] the church is robbing you from the
[2:04:24] society
[2:04:26] they were just think that the church is
[2:04:27] giving you a law oh i see you are
[2:04:29] dressing like that because of your
[2:04:30] church
[2:04:31] but if you tell them that god there's a
[2:04:34] god
[2:04:34] that has redeemed my life that god
[2:04:38] has changed me
[2:04:43] [Music]
[2:04:47] then they will see that revelation of
[2:04:49] jesus christ
[2:04:51] because that's where it starts from the
[2:04:54] seed of god brother branham says
[2:04:56] in in the revelation of jesus christ
[2:04:58] they are attracted
[2:05:01] to that revelation
[2:05:05] they know that no man can do this just
[2:05:08] like nicodemus said no man can do this
[2:05:12] they can realize that no young woman can
[2:05:14] do this in this age
[2:05:16] except god be with them
[2:05:20] don't realize that no young man can be
[2:05:22] like this no
[2:05:23] no couple can be like this except god be
[2:05:25] with him
[2:05:29] that's what nicodemus said he came by
[2:05:32] night he said master
[2:05:35] we know that you are from god because no
[2:05:38] man can do this
[2:05:40] except god be with him what he saw
[2:05:44] the revelation of jesus christ
[2:05:48] he saw the revelation of god in the body
[2:05:51] he knew
[2:05:51] that this thing that this man is doing
[2:05:53] is not a guesswork it's god that is with
[2:05:55] him
[2:05:59] and that revelation when when john wrote
[2:06:03] the book of first john the second john
[2:06:07] and ted john
[2:06:09] he just came from the island of patmos
[2:06:13] and he have seen all of the things you
[2:06:15] have seen the beast system he have seen
[2:06:17] the dragon he have seen everything
[2:06:20] but he have also seen the power that
[2:06:23] overcome
[2:06:24] in every age
[2:06:28] amen he's seen the power that overcome
[2:06:31] in every age
[2:06:32] every time the beast system rise up he
[2:06:34] saw the power that overcame
[2:06:38] he said young people
[2:06:44] is he that is in you
[2:06:48] the he that is in the world he says if
[2:06:51] you failed and you make mistakes
[2:06:53] we have an advocate don't stick there
[2:06:55] because your god is greater than your
[2:06:57] mistakes
[2:07:01] amen he says your god he says
[2:07:05] if our heart condemn us not we have
[2:07:07] faith with god he says but even if our
[2:07:09] heart condemns us
[2:07:11] god is greater than our heart
[2:07:16] since god is greater than our heart you
[2:07:18] are serving the mighty god
[2:07:20] there's a mighty god being revealed in
[2:07:22] you
[2:07:25] praise the lord amen no matter what
[2:07:27] you're going through no matter what what
[2:07:29] it seems like
[2:07:33] the thing that is pulling your heart to
[2:07:35] god
[2:07:36] the thing that is making you to to to to
[2:07:39] think about yourself and
[2:07:41] making you want to live for god more it
[2:07:43] has to be god

[2:08:25] we
[2:08:27] we want to be amen oh praise the lord
[2:08:32] this morning amen
[2:08:36] amen musicians you can come for
[2:08:46] instead of making it a teaching service
[2:08:50] i just thought that i would go down this
[2:08:52] route
[2:08:54] you know because like i said there are
[2:08:56] just some few things i need to
[2:08:58] we need to talk about you know there are
[2:09:01] some few things
[2:09:02] that we need to talk about
[2:09:05] when god when a church or a family
[2:09:08] or an individual is experiencing the
[2:09:11] move of god
[2:09:12] and god is doing something in our life
[2:09:15] or god is doing something in our home or
[2:09:17] he's doing something in our church
[2:09:20] we have to watch over there or he's
[2:09:22] doing something in our work with god in
[2:09:24] our
[2:09:25] you know our individual life we have to
[2:09:27] watch watch with that
[2:09:28] you see because the devil that's what he
[2:09:32] fights again he fights against that life
[2:09:35] of god
[2:09:37] you know and in this little assembly we
[2:09:39] have seen things that have gone and come
[2:09:42] and sometimes you know we get to that
[2:09:44] place and
[2:09:45] and it feels like you know we are
[2:09:49] getting there
[2:09:49] and pretty soon the enemy sneaks in
[2:09:53] and then he starts to destroy the life
[2:09:56] of the church
[2:09:59] and one of the one of the way he can do
[2:10:01] it is to get the people visiting
[2:10:03] everybody gets busy and everybody gets
[2:10:05] over busy and nobody paying attention to
[2:10:07] anything
[2:10:10] we're not paying attention to our family
[2:10:12] life we're not paying attention to our
[2:10:14] children's lives
[2:10:15] we're not even paying attention to what
[2:10:16] is happening in church
[2:10:23] and then before you realize the church
[2:10:24] starts losing its value and pretty soon
[2:10:28] you can feed it in the people
[2:10:31] i mean they are not worshiping god they
[2:10:33] are now pouring out their hearts like it
[2:10:35] used to be
[2:10:36] it just become a form we come and sing
[2:10:38] uh uh
[2:10:39] 15 minutes 20 minutes tell a minute we
[2:10:41] call the preacher he come and bring us a
[2:10:43] good lecture
[2:10:44] and before we realize we praise the lord
[2:10:45] we thank god we go out
[2:10:47] and we go home and that enemy gets right
[2:10:49] in there and you start destroying the
[2:10:51] church life
[2:10:51] [Music]

[2:10:56] young people he's not finding a way to
[2:10:59] get in and destroy marriages

[2:11:23] jesus said to the disciples without me

[2:11:30] and that is the same in this age without
[2:11:33] us he can do nothing he need a bride he
[2:11:36] needed people
