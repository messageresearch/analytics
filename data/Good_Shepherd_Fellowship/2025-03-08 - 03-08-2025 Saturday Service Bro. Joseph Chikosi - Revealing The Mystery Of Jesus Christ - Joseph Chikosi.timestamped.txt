[1:01:38] be with my wife sister Annie um I don't
[1:01:42] know whether you've been introduced to
[1:01:44] her but whether you have been introduced
[1:01:47] or not it gives me joy to introduce the
[1:01:51] most beautiful best cook in the whole
[1:01:54] world my my my life companion we are
[1:01:59] always
[1:02:00] together uh I always give this little
[1:02:04] story of this old Pentecostal
[1:02:08] Elder who was not very educated but he
[1:02:13] loved the Lord so much and he had a real
[1:02:15] experience of the new birth so the
[1:02:18] pastor once in a while would always give
[1:02:20] him to say a word or
[1:02:23] two so there was a wedding in the church
[1:02:27] and newly worded couple so the pastor
[1:02:30] after doing the ceremony said we ask our
[1:02:33] Elder to just come and say a few words I
[1:02:37] mean the Elder to this newly worded
[1:02:40] couple so the Elder came and blessed
[1:02:44] them and said you know you must stick
[1:02:49] together in the hard times always be
[1:02:52] together in the good times always be
[1:02:54] together and he says you be like Paul
[1:02:58] and Silas his
[1:02:59] wife they were always together he did
[1:03:02] not know that Silas was not Paul's wife
[1:03:06] but he was a very spiritual man I mean
[1:03:08] gifted in the spir but reading the Bible
[1:03:12] was was his problem so he so he he
[1:03:14] thought Silas was the wife of Paul says
[1:03:17] be like Paul and Silas his wife they
[1:03:20] went to prison together wherever they
[1:03:22] were they were together so I always call
[1:03:24] my wife
[1:03:26] Silas so it's my joy to present to you
[1:03:29] sister Silas can you stand sister chosi
[1:03:32] my blessed
[1:03:34] [Applause]
[1:03:37] wife amen so I'm so thankful it is was a
[1:03:42] joy today to get to meet brother Isaiah
[1:03:45] Brooks it has been a long long time I
[1:03:48] guess I'm 30 Old
[1:03:51] years we we haven't met for a long time
[1:03:55] but we remember very well just like
[1:03:57] yesterday when he visited Us in Zimbabwe
[1:04:00] in our church in muari he stayed in our
[1:04:03] home and it was our joy to host him we
[1:04:07] had wonderful meetings and meeting him
[1:04:10] after so many years I said to him you
[1:04:12] haven't changed much the only thing
[1:04:15] that's changed is is the hair that's
[1:04:18] that's uh that's betraying that you've
[1:04:21] been a around for a while and he says
[1:04:24] you haven't changed also only thing is
[1:04:26] you look a bit taller I said I said I
[1:04:29] don't think so I think I've lost a bit
[1:04:31] of weight so when you lose weight you
[1:04:34] look you look
[1:04:36] taller so it was nice meeting brother
[1:04:39] Isaiah Brooks and thank you very much
[1:04:41] for the sacrifice to drive all the way
[1:04:44] to come and be with us with the other
[1:04:47] saints that traveled with you and I also
[1:04:49] saw my son Samuel Chessa what a joy us
[1:04:55] to see a Zimbabwean a Zimbabwean smile a
[1:05:00] Zimbabwean
[1:05:02] welcome and uh his father was a close
[1:05:05] friend brother blessing and uh we worked
[1:05:08] very well in the ministry together and
[1:05:10] we happened to come from the same rural
[1:05:13] area in muari District there so we were
[1:05:17] quite bied when we would meet we always
[1:05:21] speak in our real deep uh dialect which
[1:05:25] others who live around the Harari area
[1:05:27] would never even understand but such was
[1:05:30] our bond and our friendship and it's
[1:05:33] good to see his son and to get to know
[1:05:36] that he's also ministering and God has
[1:05:39] been using him we thank God for that God
[1:05:43] who is rich in Mercy so without wasting
[1:05:46] much time I would like us to stand at
[1:05:50] this time and I'll pray before we read
[1:05:54] the scripture if you have
[1:05:56] any request something that you would
[1:05:59] like God to do for you you can raise
[1:06:02] your hand to God
[1:06:03] and he is still in the business of
[1:06:07] answering prayer he said where two or
[1:06:10] three are gathered in my name I'm in the
[1:06:14] midst of them so if you believe raise up
[1:06:17] your hand as we pray our commit your
[1:06:20] request to God lord Jesus we've invited
[1:06:24] you to come
[1:06:26] the song service has gone Lord Jesus the
[1:06:29] preliminaries have gone now the most
[1:06:32] important part of the service is upon us
[1:06:36] to preach the word to hear the word and
[1:06:40] Lord your word has the answer to
[1:06:43] everything that we have need of and Lord
[1:06:45] you have seen the hands which have been
[1:06:47] raised up by your children I want to
[1:06:50] lift up these hands also in prayer and
[1:06:53] saying oh Lord you who gave the promise
[1:06:57] that whatsoever things you desire When
[1:07:00] you pray believe that you receive and
[1:07:03] you shall have God I pray I present each
[1:07:07] request Before the Throne of Mercy
[1:07:10] knowing that you are the great high
[1:07:12] priest that can be touched by the
[1:07:15] feeling of our infirmities we want to
[1:07:18] thank you already for a finished work we
[1:07:21] thank you for answering us now Lord may
[1:07:24] you bless your word
[1:07:26] and bless our fellowship in Simplicity
[1:07:29] and in humility we approach the service
[1:07:32] in Jesus name
[1:07:34] amen amen I wish to read from the book
[1:07:37] of Matthew chapter
[1:07:40] 16 and also Revelation chapter 1 in
[1:07:45] Matthew chapter 16 I wish to read from
[1:07:48] verse
[1:07:49] 13 to
[1:07:51] verse 18
[1:07:56] and then from Revelation chapter one
[1:07:59] I'll read just verse one so let's start
[1:08:03] with Matthew
[1:08:06] chapter 16 from verse 13 when Jesus came
[1:08:10] into the courts of cesaria Philippi he
[1:08:13] asked his disciples saying whom do men
[1:08:16] say that I the son of man am and they
[1:08:20] said some say that thou art John the
[1:08:22] Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah
[1:08:26] or one of the prophets he said unto them
[1:08:29] but whom say ye that I am and Simon
[1:08:33] Peter answered and said Thou Art the
[1:08:35] Christ the son of the Living God Jesus
[1:08:40] answered and said unto him blessed that
[1:08:42] thou Simon but Jonah for Flesh and Blood
[1:08:46] ha not revealed it unto thee but my
[1:08:49] Father which is in heaven and I say also
[1:08:53] unto thee that thou art at Peter and
[1:08:57] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[1:09:00] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:09:05] against it amen let's go Revelation
[1:09:08] chapter one Revelation chapter one I
[1:09:13] read verse
[1:09:17] one the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[1:09:21] God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:09:24] servants things which must shortly come
[1:09:26] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[1:09:29] his Angel unto his servant John the Lord
[1:09:34] bless the reading of his word you may be
[1:09:35] seated let's look at
[1:09:38] the little title of revealing the
[1:09:41] mystery of Jesus
[1:09:45] Christ revealing the mystery of Jesus
[1:09:49] Christ we find here in the scriptures in
[1:09:52] Matthew Jesus is asking his disciples
[1:09:55] the people's opinions of him who do men
[1:09:59] say I
[1:10:02] am and why does that question come who
[1:10:06] do men say that I am this question comes
[1:10:10] because Jesus was a
[1:10:13] mystery that's why the question is
[1:10:15] coming the question what is the people's
[1:10:21] revelation of the mystery of who I am
[1:10:24] that's what is asking what's the
[1:10:26] people's Revelation what what do they
[1:10:29] think of me who do they say I am and the
[1:10:33] Book of Revelation which we read just
[1:10:35] starts there on verse one and IT
[1:10:37] addresses the issue of who Jesus is and
[1:10:41] he says the
[1:10:43] revelation of Jesus Christ so wants to
[1:10:47] bring who Christ is he wants to reveal
[1:10:50] the mystery of who Jesus is this is the
[1:10:53] answer to the question who do men say
[1:10:56] that I the son of man am so Revelation
[1:11:00] comes up the revelation of Jesus you
[1:11:02] want to know who he is this is the
[1:11:04] Revelation so the revelation of Jesus
[1:11:07] Christ that's in Revelation in other
[1:11:09] words the revelation of the mystery of
[1:11:12] who Jesus Christ is so let's look at
[1:11:16] this Jesus was a
[1:11:19] mystery his mysterious birth made him
[1:11:23] the mysterious
[1:11:25] person you cannot have a mysterious
[1:11:28] birth and then just be an ordinary
[1:11:31] person he was a mystery and his
[1:11:35] mysterious birth made him such a
[1:11:38] mysterious person in Genesis 3 on verse
[1:11:42] 15 he was the promised woman's
[1:11:47] seed how strange how mysterious how can
[1:11:52] a woman have seed
[1:11:56] it meant right there he was going to be
[1:11:59] virgin
[1:12:01] born he was going to come by Immaculate
[1:12:06] Conception which is evidenced by Isaiah
[1:12:09] 7 on verse
[1:12:10] 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:12:14] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[1:12:18] conceive and bear a son amen
[1:12:23] and shall call his name
[1:12:27] Emmanuel now in Matthew 1 on verse 23 it
[1:12:30] gives the meaning of Emmanuel behold the
[1:12:33] Virgin shall be with child and shall
[1:12:35] bring forth a son and they shall call
[1:12:37] his name Emmanuel which being
[1:12:41] interpreted is God With
[1:12:44] Us God With
[1:12:47] Us god with us as a child god with us as
[1:12:51] a son God With Us that's mysterious yeah
[1:12:56] how can God who is Spirit come to be a
[1:12:59] son to be a human being who dwells with
[1:13:02] us that that's a mystery no wonder why
[1:13:06] Jesus had to ask them hey who do people
[1:13:08] say that I
[1:13:09] am he knew who he was but he knew he was
[1:13:13] mystery to the people want to he wanted
[1:13:16] to check their Revelation and their
[1:13:18] Revelation was the cause of their
[1:13:20] rejection of him you could not be saved
[1:13:24] by a person that you were assuming to be
[1:13:27] a
[1:13:29] Jeremiah you couldn't be saved by a
[1:13:31] person whom whom you were assuming to be
[1:13:34] one of the prophets or to be or to be
[1:13:37] Isaiah that person could not possibly
[1:13:39] save you because Isaiah was not a savior
[1:13:42] neither was Jeremiah a savior for you to
[1:13:44] be saved by him you had to know he was
[1:13:47] Jehovah savior Jehovah in
[1:13:50] flesh he was Emmanuel God with us so he
[1:13:56] is he is he is cheing their Revelation
[1:14:00] here and may God help us to to revisit
[1:14:04] our revelation of who Jesus Christ is he
[1:14:07] he's more than just the man of Galilee
[1:14:10] he's more than just the Bible that we
[1:14:13] hold he is a living God living inside of
[1:14:20] you and me amen God with us as a son Son
[1:14:25] of God that is very mysterious God
[1:14:28] becoming a
[1:14:29] person God becoming a human being God
[1:14:33] becoming one of us no wonder the
[1:14:35] question was posed who do men say I am
[1:14:39] sure he was not an ordinary person he
[1:14:41] was very different he was very
[1:14:44] unique a virgin born son how can it be
[1:14:48] that's mysterious so he says who who do
[1:14:52] you think I am when you look at the way
[1:14:53] I came with when you look at the things
[1:14:56] I'm doing walking on the water and uh
[1:15:00] curing the Fig Tree and uh casting out
[1:15:04] devils and uh opening blind eyes and
[1:15:07] raising up the dead multiplying the laes
[1:15:11] and the fishes who do you think I
[1:15:16] am and who do you think he
[1:15:19] is he's the son of the Living God he's
[1:15:23] here tonight
[1:15:26] he's here tonight he's alive and
[1:15:30] well and is more than willing to sort
[1:15:33] out all our
[1:15:35] problems all our frustrations all our
[1:15:38] mind battles all our depressions and all
[1:15:42] our needs and desires is more than able
[1:15:46] to
[1:15:49] supply that's
[1:15:51] mysterious who do men say that I this
[1:15:54] Myster serious person am what is their
[1:15:58] revelation of me Matthew
[1:16:01] 1:8 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[1:16:04] this wise when as his mother Mary was
[1:16:07] spoused to Joseph before they came
[1:16:11] together she was found with child of the
[1:16:14] Holy Ghost that's
[1:16:16] abnormal that's that's abnormal that's
[1:16:19] not normal that's out of this before
[1:16:22] they came
[1:16:23] together how can it be that has never
[1:16:25] happened and that will never
[1:16:29] happen no one ever came that way we all
[1:16:33] have a mother and a father whether you
[1:16:35] like the parents or not but they are
[1:16:36] there they happen to be your parents
[1:16:39] whether your parent is a drunker whether
[1:16:41] it's a wish doctor whatever but that's
[1:16:44] your that's your father that's even the
[1:16:45] prophet was not very comfortable with
[1:16:47] his father he was an alcoholic he was a
[1:16:50] drinker but still that was his father
[1:16:52] and that could not be changed and so he
[1:16:56] was
[1:16:57] mysterious before they came together he
[1:17:00] was found with child of the holy ghost
[1:17:03] child of the Holy Ghost that's indeed
[1:17:06] mysterious that is strange that's a
[1:17:09] paradox no wonder why he was a mystery
[1:17:13] you can only become a
[1:17:16] mystery if you were born mysterious and
[1:17:21] unless you become a mystery you're not a
[1:17:23] Christian
[1:17:27] think about it unless you become a
[1:17:30] mystery you cannot be a Christian being
[1:17:32] an ordinary person who is understood by
[1:17:34] everybody loved by everybody well spoken
[1:17:38] of everybody if you are a real Christian
[1:17:40] you will be a strange
[1:17:43] fellow you will be an odd ball you'll be
[1:17:46] an odd person if you are going to walk
[1:17:49] with Christ you are going to be very
[1:17:50] different you are going to be just your
[1:17:52] own species your own type your own your
[1:17:56] own your own
[1:17:57] kind you will not be understood by many
[1:18:00] because you won't join up with them you
[1:18:02] will never go out with them to their
[1:18:04] parties and their worldly things you
[1:18:06] won't dress like them you won't act like
[1:18:09] them you won't even worship like them
[1:18:12] you just become so
[1:18:14] unique so you've got to be born again in
[1:18:20] a mysterious way in a miraculous way in
[1:18:26] an Immaculate
[1:18:29] way come on Amen what happened to Mary

[1:22:52] this in Luke chapter one
[1:22:55] when Peter said Thou Art the Christ he

[1:23:06] answer which had no scriptural
[1:23:09] background thou had the son of the
[1:23:11] Living God yes it was a revelation The
[1:23:13] Father revealed it but you see when the
[1:23:16] father reveals anything it's got to be
[1:23:19] scriptural right right amen you cannot
[1:23:22] just say it I've got a ration and and
[1:23:25] then when you check it with the Bible
[1:23:28] the Bible is saying one thing and your
[1:23:31] Revelation is saying another oh no you
[1:23:33] you dump that and take the word of God
[1:23:36] when Peter said Thou Art the Son of God
[1:23:40] we can check that repr with the word of
[1:23:42] God let's go to Luke chapter 1 look at
[1:23:45] this verse 35 then said Mary unto the
[1:23:49] angel how shall this be seeing I know
[1:23:54] not a man man he's answering Gabriel who

[1:25:38] be called The Son of God so you see now
[1:25:43] Hallelujah Peter was in line yes with
[1:25:47] the scriptures he didn't just he didn't
[1:25:49] just he didn't just scream out who who
[1:25:53] Christ was
[1:25:54] just because something got revealed
[1:25:56] which was no scriptural if it's a
[1:25:59] revelation it must have a SC
[1:26:03] Foundation someone say Amen a real
[1:26:07] divine revelation is based upon the
[1:26:11] foundation of the word of
[1:26:14] God that the Christ hallu son of the
[1:26:17] Living God let's check that Revelation
[1:26:20] with the word let's go back to how Jesus
[1:26:22] was born he was born in a mysterious way
[1:26:25] Hallelujah he came in a mysterious way

[1:36:43] power to become the sons
[1:36:47] of let's just look a little bit more
[1:36:49] here on how mysterious Jesus was in what
[1:36:53] he would
[1:36:54] say the way that he lived can you
[1:36:57] imagine a man of his caliber saying
[1:37:00] foxes
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:03] have birds of
[1:37:06] the but the man has nowhere to lay his
[1:37:10] that's mysterious how can he fail to
[1:37:13] have a place to stay when he could walk
[1:37:15] on the water when he could multiply
[1:37:17] loaves of then he says I nowhere to lay
[1:37:21] my hand he would just sleep wherever the
[1:37:23] Sun said if the sun set while he was in
[1:37:25] the mountain he slept there if the son
[1:37:27] set while he was he was at Peter's home
[1:37:29] he slept there wherever he was that was
[1:37:33] his home for that day yet he was
[1:37:36] God in flesh he was the
[1:37:40] creator he could have spoken a house
[1:37:44] into existence wherever he was and speak
[1:37:47] it into existence and the meeting is

[1:38:12] really matters right you don't worry
[1:38:14] about all these other things when you
[1:38:17] know but anyway look how let's just take
[1:38:20] it in Matthew 13 Matthew 13343
[1:38:24] Matthew 1334 and 35 all these things
[1:38:27] spake Jesus unto the multitude in
[1:38:31] Parables and without a parable spake he
[1:38:34] not unto them that it might be fulfilled
[1:38:39] which was
[1:38:40] spoken by the prophet saying I will open
[1:38:45] my mouth in Parable our out things which
[1:38:50] have
[1:38:51] never which have been kept secret from
[1:38:55] the foundation of the world he spoken

[1:41:04] look how strange Jesus was John 3:13 and
[1:41:09] no man have ascended up to heaven but he
[1:41:15] that came down from heaven even the son
[1:41:19] of man which is in heaven
[1:41:24] people who are listening hearing the son
[1:41:26] of man which came down from heaven which
[1:41:29] is even now in heaven that he was
[1:41:31] standing right there he spoke in
[1:41:36] par John
[1:41:38] 633 for the bread of God is he which
[1:41:42] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[1:41:45] unto the
[1:41:47] world John 6: 41:42 the Jews then memor
[1:41:51] him because he said I am the pr bread
[1:41:53] which came down from heaven and they
[1:41:55] said is this not Jo Jesus the son of
[1:41:58] Joseph whose father and mother we know
[1:42:01] how is it then that he says I came down
[1:42:05] from heaven it was a mystery he was a
[1:42:08] mystery verse 51 of John 6 I am the
[1:42:11] living bread which came down from heaven
[1:42:14] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[1:42:16] live forever and the bread that I will
[1:42:19] give is my flesh which I will give for
[1:42:22] the life of the world he kept on it
[1:42:25] mystery upon mystery on verse 52 the
[1:42:28] Jews therefore strove among themselves
[1:42:30] saying how can this man give us his
[1:42:34] flesh to eat let's go to John 7 verse 12
[1:42:39] listen to this and there was much
[1:42:42] meming among the people
[1:42:45] concerning
[1:42:47] him some say he's a good man others n
[1:42:52] but he deceive the people wasn't there
[1:42:55] much memory about brother BR yeah among
[1:42:59] the religious
[1:43:00] circles they were so astounded so
[1:43:04] astonished by his gift and they wanted
[1:43:09] even their that gift to be to be to be
[1:43:12] to be done in their churches so that
[1:43:15] they would fill up their their pews but
[1:43:17] when he started to open his mouth and
[1:43:19] start to explain things there was much
[1:43:22] murmuring
[1:43:24] yeah
[1:43:25] M there was much memory among the people
[1:43:29] concerning him he was a
[1:43:31] mystery John 7 the same chapter on verse
[1:43:34] 15 and the Jews marveled saying how
[1:43:37] knoweth this man letters have never
[1:43:43] learned if you read further he says my
[1:43:45] Doctrine is not of men it is from above
[1:43:49] am and Peter when he says Thou Art it
[1:43:52] was not his Doctrine it was from above
[1:43:55] God revealed it to him amen so because
[1:43:58] he was a mystery you know what because
[1:44:02] he was a mystery he caused a division
[1:44:05] among the people sure what he did he
[1:44:09] caused a division among the people and
[1:44:12] he said it in Luke 12 on verse 51
[1:44:14] suppose he that I am come to give peace
[1:44:16] on Earth I tell you nay but rather
[1:44:21] division then in John 7: 43 let's see
[1:44:25] what these people said after he had
[1:44:27] spoken to them so there was a division
[1:44:30] among the people because of him and I
[1:44:33] want you to know today he's the same
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:37] yesterday forever there will be a
[1:44:40] division if you have him in you you

[1:44:50] keep on walking with isau if you are
[1:44:52] Jacob
[1:44:53] going to come a separation and division
[1:44:56] let's go to chapter 9 John verse 16 John
[1:45:00] 9:16 therefore said some of the
[1:45:02] Pharisees this man is not of God because
[1:45:06] he keepeth not the Sabbath day and that
[1:45:09] said how can a man that is a sinner do
[1:45:12] such Miracles and there was a
[1:45:20] division this is beautiful was Aion you
[1:45:23] know when God said let there be light
[1:45:26] there

[1:45:31] Darkness one corner and when you are
[1:45:34] born again there will be a
[1:45:36] division there was a division among them

[1:50:23] paragraph
[1:50:24] 303 Watch God's Great Revelation
[1:50:30] unfold by lack of this
[1:50:33] Revelation is why we have so many
[1:50:36] different divisions among us and so much
[1:50:40] mockery so much division Among Us is
[1:50:42] because the people lack that
[1:50:47] Revelation see they lack that Revelation
[1:50:52] that
[1:50:53] teachers may God help us to
[1:50:58] teach the right Revelation that's
[1:51:02] right so even don't to speak
[1:51:04] mysteriously because as I said he was a
[1:51:07] mystery himself let's see what he said
[1:51:09] in John 2: 19 destroy this
[1:51:15] Temple and in three
[1:51:17] days I'll raise it up what is it talking
[1:51:21] about let's go to John
[1:51:25] 11:25 I
[1:51:27] am the resurrection how can person be
[1:51:31] the
[1:51:32] resurrection how can an individual be
[1:51:34] the
[1:51:35] resurrection I mean the resurrection is
[1:51:37] someone who's dead rising up but he's
[1:51:40] saying I am the resurrection you know
[1:51:42] what and on the same basis we can say
[1:51:46] tonight we are the
[1:51:48] Rapture why we possess that seed
[1:51:52] we have the Revelation that we shall not
[1:51:55] die but we shall be changed in a moment
[1:51:59] in the
[1:52:01] quick this Mortal will put on
[1:52:03] immortality so we can actually say we
[1:52:06] are the rupt yes he said he was in John
[1:52:10] chapter 10 quickly John chapter 10 17
[1:52:13] and 18 therefore do my father love me
[1:52:16] because I lay down my life that I might
[1:52:20] take it again
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:25] 18 no man taketh it from me but I lay
[1:52:29] down of myself I have power to lay it
[1:52:33] down and I have power to take it again
[1:52:37] his commandment have I received of my
[1:52:40] father indeed he was in mystery and no
[1:52:44] man ever spoke like him because no man
[1:52:48] was born like him in John 474 46 John
[1:52:54] 746 the officers answered because the
[1:52:58] Pharisees had sent some people to go
[1:53:00] take him and bring him but when they
[1:53:03] heard him speak hey when they heard him
[1:53:07] speak they were just powerless they lost
[1:53:11] all their power I remember when we first
[1:53:13] repented and we left the Methodist
[1:53:15] Church and the scripture Union movements
[1:53:17] and things like that and then people
[1:53:19] were being warned against us it by the
[1:53:23] denomination where we had laugh and they
[1:53:26] say never you give those people a chance
[1:53:28] to speak to you because they will just
[1:53:30] confuse you about the scriptures don't
[1:53:33] let them open the Bible he said wow how
[1:53:35] can a preacher say don't let someone
[1:53:37] open the Bible what what is he talking
[1:53:41] what is he giving to the people the
[1:53:43] Bible says there and no never men John
[1:53:48] 7:46 never man spake like this man
[1:53:54] verse
[1:53:55] 53 and every man went on to his own
[1:54:03] house what a conclusion what a
[1:54:06] conclusion they couldn't go to each
[1:54:09] other's house to fellow or talk about
[1:54:12] what each man went to his own
[1:54:15] house this is this is I don't know about
[1:54:18] this I don't know I don't know about
