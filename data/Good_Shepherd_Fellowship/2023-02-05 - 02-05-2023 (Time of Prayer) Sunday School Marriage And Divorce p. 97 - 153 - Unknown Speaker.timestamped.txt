[1:34] nature you know
[1:36] but when she broke God's word
[1:40] God made a man to be a ruler over her
[1:45] Genesis 3 16 if you want to put it down
[1:49] she was no more equal with the man
[1:53] she was a breaker of God's word don't
[1:56] you see she she the church down here
[2:00] the breaker of God's word that sold her
[2:02] completely out of continuity and that's
[2:04] what the church has done his wrote
[2:06] spiritual death upon the whole thing
[2:09] now you'll understand why hammered these
[2:11] things like I do
[2:13] truth
[2:17] this is Bible facts
[2:22] notice
[2:25] why does she do such a thing as this
[2:28] how could that lovely beautiful
[2:31] perfect woman
[2:34] I've seen a picture one time I believe
[2:37] it was in Greece of an artist that
[2:39] painted a picture of Eve she's the most
[2:41] horrible thing ever seen
[2:43] that shows a lot of carnal mind can look
[2:45] at
[2:46] but she wasn't she was beautiful
[2:49] of course she's perfect
[2:51] woman or woman
[2:53] notice
[2:55] why did she do such a thing being in
[2:59] that high order
[3:02] she was right with man co-equal with him
[3:07] but we all know now that she will lost
[3:10] her co-equalus with man when she sinned
[3:14] and God said man will be your ruler from
[3:17] here out
[3:21] now that's the scripture
[3:24] if you want to we can read it I'm giving
[3:25] you the scripture so save time for this
[3:28] big hook up across the country that you
[3:30] might read it yourself
[3:32] notice the reason she did that
[3:36] how did Satan ever get to her
[3:42] did you know Satan must co-equal with
[3:46] God one day
[3:49] sure was
[3:52] all but a creator
[3:54] he was everything
[3:55] stood at the right hand of God in the
[3:57] heavens the great leading chairman
[4:00] notice
[4:02] the reason that she did this she was not
[4:06] in the original creation
[4:10] she is not in God's original creation
[4:15] she is a byproduct
[4:19] therefore
[4:21] the beginning as Jesus referred to it
[4:24] she was not a original created being of
[4:27] God
[4:29] she's a byproduct of a man
[4:34] when Jesus referred to the beginning
[4:37] remember Adam was both masculine and
[4:41] feminist
[4:42] in the original creation one
[4:46] but then he was separated by a rib
[4:52] notice
[4:54] but a byproduct
[4:56] and notice the only
[5:00] one of all God's creation of every
[5:03] animal and anything else she was the
[5:05] only one designed this way
[5:08] every other female was in the original
[5:10] creation
[5:15] every other female was in the original
[5:17] creation
[5:19] but Eve was not in the original creation
[5:24] see that had to be made that way we'll
[5:26] get to it after a while
[5:30] notice in this creation she was in
[5:32] not in the original
[5:34] but a byproduct
[5:38] and in this creation there is now I
[5:42] don't want to hurt your feelings
[5:44] but I want to tell you the truth and you
[5:46] just said still you're doing nice
[5:48] there is nothing designed to be so
[5:52] deceitful as a woman is this evil
[5:55] there cannot be nothing else there's
[5:57] nothing made to be that way
[6:03] that's right
[6:04] also there is nothing that can be so
[6:08] easily deceived as a woman
[6:12] now the fall proves this statement to be
[6:14] true
[6:16] the fall in the beginning
[6:21] she was not in the original beginning
[6:25] creation she was in Adam
[6:29] but not in a female set herself at the
[6:33] beginning
[6:34] she was a byproduct me
[6:37] now there's nothing designed
[6:40] that can deceive and be deceived as easy
[6:44] as a woman
[6:48] there is nothing designed or can stupid
[6:52] as low as a woman can
[6:58] think now
[7:00] there's nothing designed in all creation
[7:03] that can stoop as low as a woman can
[7:07] she can tear a man's heart to Pieces
[7:10] easier than anything else there is in
[7:12] the world
[7:13] is his wife that that nice little wife
[7:15] get to run around some other man look at
[7:17] that Feller sitting there with these
[7:18] children of Tears dropping off his eyes
[7:22] she is designed that way
[7:25] she is designed to do this
[7:29] there is no hog
[7:32] no dog or no other animal designed like
[7:36] her Ark is stupid as low as she can
[7:39] stoop
[7:40] okay
[7:41] now that is true yeah amen with regards
[7:44] to my sisters
[7:46] I just want you to watch
[7:48] no animal can be immoral
[7:53] you call the dog a slept
[7:57] the female dog
[7:58] you call the male hog aside
[8:02] but her Morris is a million miles Beyond
[8:05] many Hollywood stars
[8:11] that's how low she's designed to stoop
[8:16] she can't
[8:18] just think of this now there's nothing
[8:21] in the world made in God's creation that
[8:24] can be immoral stoop that low
[8:27] you say wait a minute man we're going to
[8:28] get to that the woman has to say yes
[8:32] notice
[8:34] there's nothing designed to stoop Solo
[8:37] or be filthy but a woman
[8:40] a dog can't do it
[8:43] a hog can't do it a bird can't do it
[8:47] no animal is immoral nor it can be
[8:52] for it is not designed so it can be
[8:56] a female hog can't be immoral
[8:59] a female dog can't be immoral a female
[9:02] bird can't be immoral
[9:05] a woman is the only thing can do it
[9:08] I see where Satan went
[9:11] see
[9:13] but still she has she's ones got the
[9:15] power to say yes or no see depends on
[9:18] where she wants to hold herself
[9:21] now here we can see plainly the serpent
[9:25] seed work come in
[9:28] there's only one place he could go to
[9:33] that would nail it down somebody's blind
[9:38] it had to go to that
[9:41] notice
[9:43] the reason animals couldn't do it a
[9:45] female animal they were in the original
[9:48] creation but the woman was not in that
[9:52] original creation
[9:54] now we're going back to dig this up and
[9:56] bring it right down to the modern day
[9:57] and The Testament
[10:00] she is designed alone for Filth and
[10:03] unclean living
[10:06] a dog can
[10:09] no other female can
[10:12] it's just the woman that can
[10:15] a dog or any other animals
[10:18] once a year and that for her babies
[10:24] not for sexual pleasure
[10:27] but for her babies
[10:30] the old saw
[10:33] the old dog
[10:36] once a year one moment that's for her
[10:40] babies
[10:43] but a woman is designed for any time she
[10:46] desires
[10:50] I've got some stuff crossed out here now
[10:52] you can imagine the rest
[10:55] a dog can woman can
[10:58] I hope that the Holy Spirit reveals you
[11:00] the rest of this I crossed out here
[11:02] she is the only species BC uh female
[11:06] that is made prettier than the male
[11:12] there's not another specie among
[11:15] anything all other creatures of God is
[11:18] beautiful males
[11:20] such as in animals birds and so forth
[11:24] always the male is pretty
[11:29] look at the big buck deer big fine horns
[11:33] grape species
[11:35] and a little humble Doe
[11:39] look at the big rooster with all these
[11:41] pretty feathers
[11:42] and the little brown hen
[11:45] look at the birds the and the hen
[11:48] why
[11:51] why was it such of all the creatures of
[11:53] God
[11:56] every creature in the mail
[11:59] is the prettiest
[12:01] between the Sheep between the Hogs
[12:03] between the horses between anything else
[12:06] it's always
[12:08] the big male is pretty
[12:11] and in the birds but in the human race
[12:14] it's the woman that's pretty
[12:19] not the man
[12:20] if he is he's something wrong
[12:22] it's crossed up seed somewhere
[12:26] a richness that way
[12:28] wow
[12:29] why was it done
[12:32] to deceive
[12:34] her designer Satan is still working on
[12:37] her tooth in these last days
[12:40] let me stop here just for a moment
[12:45] pretty
[12:47] did you know at the first destruction
[12:49] internationally of the world or
[12:51] worldwide was because of pretty women
[12:55] when the sons of God saw the daughters
[12:58] of man were Fair
[13:01] they taken unto them women
[13:04] is that right
[13:06] have you noticed
[13:08] the increase of beauty of women in this
[13:12] day
[13:14] I have seen the picture of Pearl Bryant
[13:17] which is supposed to be the prettiest
[13:19] woman in the nation at one time
[13:21] there isn't a teenage girl in this
[13:24] school but what would outshadow her
[13:27] when it comes to Beauty
[13:29] the increase of the beauty of women is
[13:32] showing
[13:34] the time of deception
[13:37] when did the church look any more
[13:39] prettier than us today
[13:42] the thing is
[13:44] featuring great big fine buildings and
[13:46] millions of this and millions of that
[13:48] don't you see
[13:49] the deception
[13:54] now there's nothing can stoop like her
[13:58] and she is designed
[14:01] so that she can be deceiving
[14:04] and Satan is really working on her today
[14:06] in these last days
[14:08] because he is her designer
[14:13] I can prove that now to go right back at
[14:15] the beginning who started to work on her
[14:18] foreign
[14:22] God or Satan
[14:25] see that's her designer
[14:28] it's her Chief weapon to throw man to
[14:33] her filth
[14:35] being a pretty woman she could sway on
[14:37] me any way she wants to
[14:39] brother date to Bootleg jaunt down here
[14:40] gets a man it's a pretty woman walking
[14:42] down the street twisting herself half
[14:44] dressed
[14:46] that's what takes
[14:48] that's a deceiver right there
[14:52] and she's deadly with it
[14:55] absolutely deadly
[14:58] you may question me about Satan being
[15:02] her designer
[15:07] but that's the truth
[15:09] Satan designed her he still does it
[15:14] let me show you something in the
[15:15] scripture I got to take it back
[15:16] scripture and you draw your opinion as
[15:17] you look at it today
[15:20] Satan is the one who features that kind
[15:23] of beauty
[15:25] if we'll notice he was the most
[15:28] beautiful of all these angels in heaven
[15:31] is that right yes
[15:34] and he desired to make Heaven a more
[15:37] beautiful place than the kingdom of
[15:39] Michael
[15:40] is that right
[15:42] also to show this Cain was his son he
[15:45] offered a more beautiful worship
[15:46] decorate his orders with fruits and
[15:48] flowers and so forth
[15:50] is that right
[15:51] beautiful
[15:54] sin is beautiful
[15:58] what we call Beauty today
[16:00] and sin is deceiving by Beauty
[16:05] and never look at a woman going down the
[16:07] street and tell what's in her heart
[16:09] thing but I won't just say these things
[16:12] to what you can see why that Satan is
[16:14] her designer
[16:18] it's exactly right
[16:21] his own son proved it
[16:23] King
[16:25] now
[16:27] she's beautiful so she can deceive the
[16:30] world is beautiful so it can deceive I
[16:32] mean Cosmos the order of the world it's
[16:35] beautiful so it can deceive great find
[16:38] places and luxury remember the prophet
[16:40] Amos when he come up over look down into
[16:42] the City and see like a modern Hollywood
[16:44] is the little eyes
[16:46] got little under that gray hair hanging
[16:48] in his face and he walked down there
[16:50] with a message and burst out on that
[16:53] place he said the very God that you came
[16:55] to serve will destroy you
[16:59] right
[17:00] sin is pretty
[17:03] they picture Judas as some old drunken
[17:06] sought out here on the street somewhere
[17:07] and mouth hanging with flies in it and
[17:09] so forth and Judas Judas is handsome
[17:13] strong
[17:16] a Deceiver
[17:19] they that gotta watch around you it
[17:21] ain't a guy that the old farmer come
[17:22] here with a pair of overalls on to watch
[17:24] around your wife is that slicker
[17:28] he's a rascal
[17:32] sin is beautiful to the eyes of the
[17:36] world but God
[17:39] is not featured in that kind of beauty
[17:42] do you know that
[17:44] God is featured in character
[17:48] beautiful character
[17:50] in the Bible Isaiah 53 if you want to
[17:52] put the scripture on it's got rules of
[17:54] scripture wrote on the side here for it
[17:56] Isaiah 53 the Bible said of our Lord
[17:59] Jesus
[18:02] that there was no beauty that we should
[18:04] desire him
[18:06] and we hid as it was our faces from him
[18:10] is that right
[18:12] we just desire him because he wasn't
[18:14] pretty
[18:16] is probably a little fellow stoop
[18:18] shouldered Ruddy looking
[18:20] and it wasn't desirable
[18:23] to be a leader he didn't look like a
[18:25] leader
[18:26] talk with Common Street talk and so
[18:29] forth like the people does the common
[18:30] people so therefore he didn't look like
[18:32] he's any great scholar educated fine all
[18:35] robed up and everything he was just an
[18:37] ordinary man
[18:38] there was no beauty of him that we
[18:41] should desire him he walked in and out
[18:43] of man right along that didn't even know
[18:44] who he was
[18:46] he didn't look like a god walking along
[18:48] what we'd think was a god
[18:52] but the same he was
[18:57] did you notice when the Lord God said to
[19:00] you
[19:02] just Samuel
[19:04] go up to the house of Jesse and anoint
[19:08] one of his sons
[19:11] King to take Saul's place now the people
[19:15] chose Saul when Samuel absolutely told
[19:19] him not to do it
[19:21] he said God don't want you to have a
[19:23] king
[19:24] he's your king
[19:26] and said if I ever said anything to you
[19:28] in the name of the Lord but what come to
[19:30] pass
[19:30] I've ever begged you for money or
[19:32] something other from a living they said
[19:33] no you never begged us for money and
[19:35] whatever you said in the name Lord had
[19:37] come to pass but we want the king anyhow
[19:39] so they chose Saul look what the World
[19:42] shows look what Israel truth
[19:45] amen Israel God's anointed
[19:50] they chose a man that was Head and
[19:53] Shoulders above any man in the nation
[19:56] great big fine handsome looking fella
[19:59] and he always was a fly in the ointment
[20:02] he
[20:03] but God said I'm going to choose you a
[20:06] king to my choosing
[20:09] so he said Samuel I ain't going to tell
[20:11] you who he is but you go up there's one
[20:13] of Jesse's Sons
[20:14] Jesse his wife and all of them look
[20:16] around said yes our oldest son he's a
[20:19] great tall handsome man he looked just
[20:21] right for the king's crown he's smart
[20:22] he's educated he's a fine man I know
[20:25] he'll be just right he speaks his word
[20:26] properly when they brought him out
[20:28] Samuel Took The Crucible and went
[20:30] towards him he said no the Lord refused
[20:32] him
[20:34] so he went all the way down to six Sons
[20:38] and the Lord refused every one of them
[20:40] he said isn't there another one oh he
[20:43] said yes there's one he's back out there
[20:45] herding the Sheep he just sits back
[20:48] there and plays songs and sings it and
[20:50] shouts and goes on but he's the little
[20:52] old stoop shoulder Ruddy looking guy he
[20:54] would never make a king he said go get
[20:56] him
[20:57] and while David come in the sight of the
[21:00] Prophet The Prophet remember the heart
[21:02] and poured it up on his head said this
[21:03] is God's children
[21:07] not pretty
[21:09] but character
[21:12] God looks at character man looks at
[21:15] natural beauty
[21:17] it's deceiving
[21:20] that's why a woman was given
[21:23] that beauty for deception
[21:27] to deceive
[21:29] a beautiful woman if she don't use it in
[21:32] the right way it's a curse to her
[21:34] that'll Center the hell quicker than
[21:36] anything else I know of
[21:40] if she just if she can be pretty sure as
[21:43] long as she stays with her husband and
[21:45] does what's right and that that's fine
[21:46] and dandy but she can take that same
[21:48] thing in my how she can deceive with it
[21:51] for it was give to her to do so
[21:54] notice
[21:56] now but God is featured in character
[22:00] there was no Beauty we should desire
[22:02] Jesus but there never was a character
[22:04] like him on the Earth
[22:06] Hallelujah
[22:08] oh
[22:09] we find out today
[22:12] that uh
[22:14] that Church character
[22:18] Satan and his group look after big
[22:21] beautiful churches
[22:23] beautiful things
[22:25] that's what the world looks at today oh
[22:28] it's a pastor the great so-and-so time
[22:30] so and so so Priestly and godly walking
[22:33] out these big robes and things like that
[22:35] they called that beauty but the real
[22:38] saints of God looks for the character of
[22:41] the Vindicated word
[22:43] that's what the Saints did in that day
[22:45] when they seen Jesus he wants nothing to
[22:48] look at but they seen God was in him
[22:50] they seen God was with him
[22:53] that's how that those uh joab and those
[22:56] characters are with David a little old
[22:57] fellow but they seen the the man was in
[23:00] him they seen that God was in him and
[23:02] they knowed he was coming into Power
[23:03] someday
[23:04] they once through them other five
[23:06] brothers of God single-handed one killed
[23:09] 300 men once some women was picking some
[23:11] beans for dinner the Army gone away and
[23:13] he took a spirit killed 300 man
[23:17] for listings
[23:19] character why they stayed right by David
[23:22] they know the anointing was upon him
[23:23] they know he was coming into Power a
[23:27] pure picture of the church today that'll
[23:29] stand by the word we oh it's going to be
[23:32] made vindicating we know it's coming
[23:33] into Power someday
[23:35] although Saul he was a fugitive from the
[23:38] rest of Nations
[23:39] they know he was coming into power we
[23:42] know he's coming into power too so we
[23:43] take that word and stand right there no
[23:46] matter what it costs we have to cut
[23:47] Palestines or jump in a pit and kill a
[23:49] lion as one did
[23:51] we go anyhow
[23:53] because it's so
[23:55] that's why God designed it to be we look
[23:57] for character
[23:59] you may now ask me why did he permit her
[24:05] to be designed thus
[24:08] I don't want to take too much time cause
[24:09] God a lot more to say here
[24:14] why the question might arise then why
[24:17] did God make this woman like this
[24:20] why did he permit her to be like that
[24:23] it was for his own good pleasure
[24:27] sure now if you want to turn in your
[24:30] Bible just a minute let's turn to Romans
[24:33] 9 just a minute and show you something
[24:34] how God does these things
[24:36] if you want to to read it
[24:39] and we can see here what God does for
[24:41] his own good pleasure a Romans 9 14.
[24:47] then what shall we say then is there
[24:50] unrighteousness before God when he chose
[24:53] Esau or chose Jacob and rejected Esau
[24:56] before either boy could have a right to
[24:58] make a choice himself
[25:02] neither one of them before there was
[25:03] born still in the womb of the mother God
[25:05] said I hate Esau and I love Jacob
[25:09] see why
[25:10] for he said unto Moses I will have mercy
[25:13] on whom I will have mercy and I will
[25:15] have compassion on whom I will have
[25:16] compassion so then it is not him that
[25:19] willeth nor him that runeth but it's God
[25:22] that's yourth Mercy for the scripture
[25:24] saith unto Pharaoh even for this same
[25:27] purpose have I raised thee up that I
[25:30] might show my power Indy and that my
[25:33] name might be declared throughout all
[25:36] the Earth therefore he now what's your
[25:39] for he
[25:41] a mercy on whom he will have mercy and
[25:44] whom he will he hardneth thou will say
[25:47] unto me uh why then does he find fault
[25:52] for who has resisted his will nay
[25:56] but o man who art thou that rise against
[26:01] God shall the Thane form say to him that
[26:04] formed it why has Thou made me this has
[26:07] not the Potter power over the clay of
[26:11] the same lump to make one vessel to
[26:14] honor and the other to dishonor
[26:18] what if God willing to show his wrath
[26:21] and to make his power known endure such
[26:24] long sufferings The Vessel of Wrath
[26:27] fitted to destructions
[26:30] that he might make known the richest of
[26:33] his glory
[26:35] on the vessel of Mercy which he has a
[26:38] four prepared unto Glory
[26:41] now are you that'll happen
[26:45] God did it he had to make it this way
[26:49] it had to be there now listen
[26:53] now for about five minutes I want to
[26:55] call your attention to something
[26:56] what is God
[26:59] God is a great eternal
[27:02] at the beginning way back before there
[27:04] was a beginning he wasn't even God did
[27:06] you know that
[27:08] God's an object of worship and it wasn't
[27:10] nothing to worship him he lived alone
[27:13] and in him was attributes
[27:16] what is an attribute a thought
[27:19] now you get something else border on the
[27:22] lesson for tonight
[27:23] notice he was his attributes that was in
[27:26] him now it was in him to be father it
[27:30] was in him to be God it was in him to be
[27:33] son it was in him to be savior it was in
[27:35] him to be healer and all these things
[27:38] here are just displaying his attributes
[27:41] there's nothing out of order
[27:54] you think God didn't see the end from
[27:56] the beginning
[27:57] certainly he did there's nothing out of
[28:00] order just displaying his attributes now
