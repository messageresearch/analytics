week and uh we will just take few announcement and prayer requests here and then uh we will get into the fellowship around the world praise the Lord amen we want to say Happy Thanksgiving to to each and every one of you as uh we prepare to uh sit with our families and Lord ones and uh uh be grateful to the Lord Brother bam said is uh is uh should be a truth American uh holiday uh Christian in a sense they are the men used to gather and thank God for their Harvest thank God for their health thank God for their family and that's what it should mean to us praise the Lord amen I know that uh we're living in the society that is that that term to be truth but manying of what the society is as truth you know the go behind the monument and the dig the truth uh for the monument to be breaking down the go behind holidays and dig the truth uh so we can get rid of those holidays we have to know that the spirit that is that is driving those people is not a spirit of Christ praise the lord it's a spirit that uh that have got hold of this uh uh Nation uh way back uh uh uh in 1950s brother brandham was talking about how uh uh the spirit of communist is trying to break the American value and uh and and he says uh uh it's creeping into the schools is creeping into our politics and these are the spirits that is that is driving these people now men will always have to find their reason to fight for something so they might have behind civil rights they might hide behind Justice they might hide behind whatever they are hiding behind trying to Proclaim truth you have to realize that it's not the spirit of Christ praise the Lord because the spirit of Christ will first take us to the foot of the cross amen recognize that we are seen or saved by grace and then uh and then it would it would take us more closer to God it will brings it will bring us Christian value praise the Lord now what is what is the important of saying that uh uh uh after all Thanksgiving used to be where where they used to hang people and they used to eat food and and celebrate and all of that what is the value if we would just destroy you know uh uh uh the the principle of sitting down and saying thank you praise the Lord if if for the rest of America T giving is just to have a turkey on their table it must not be the same for you and you and I amen amen praise the Lord because we know it's not just one day every day that we live is a Thanksgiving to the Lord but if if that day is set aside it's almost like Christmas we know the myth that is around Christmas we know there is nothing truth about December 24th being the birthday of Jesus Christ it's not proven biblically but if the word will gather together and they will think that is a day for them to make a remembrance or a commemoration of Our Savior then we must do it better than they do it amen we must not get into their culture of uh uh meeting lighting funding party but it must be a day where we can say because he live amen we can say God send the greatest gift to the word praise the Lord they might have the date wrong we uh uh the date does not matter it's the gift that matter praise the Lord amen so we want to say Happy Thanksgiving to each and every one of you whichever way you choose to celebrate we pray that the Lord will be at your table we pray that he will be at your heart praise the Lord amen and as we go into this week uh there will not be service on Wednesday night like we normally do praise the Lord and uh we will have look forward to meet you on next Sunday but uh on Friday we will be having uh uh a little memorial for Brother Steve jamb BBE year uh uh the the deacons will give uh uh sheets out after the service this morning for direction for the funeral home time and uh and all the things but on uh on on Friday we we place on the sheet here I put a time for 6: p.m. we will start at 7:00 but I put 6: p.m. because uh uh uh the family will be inviting other people and uh uh we have a call of lateness so I just PST 6:00 p.m. so we can be able to get people in the building and we'll be able to start on time but whether people come on night we're going to start 7 700 p.m. and then we're going to make sure that we are out of here before 10:00 or by 10:00 so uh uh and then on Saturday uh comes the funeral uh uh the address is there you can take it and then uh find a place somewhere there in Crystal Lake that's for the funeral and then after the family is having the repass and and uh uh that it called the celebration of life and that is somewhere in uh uh krai the the address is also there so that would be for Friday and Saturday there's uh uh brother Steven Jambi that's have us here as Deacon and uh uh he and brother Ben came to the Deacon office at the same same time but uh I think because of his age and his experience brother brother Ben treated him as the head deacon now he's gone chronologically Brother D brother B should be our head Deacon praise the Lord and uh he's also traveling to Kenya for some family uh matters he be leaving in the coming week uh so he asked that we that we pray for him so he have a prayer request here we'll bring that to the Lord that's

praise the Lord amen and uh we have few prayer requests here that we be having some brothers coming in now brother brother uh brother Timon brother Timon will be coming in uh tomorrow uh if if I get

brother Paul that Ser as one of his deacons will be flying back after the funeral on Saturday brother Simon and and brother brother Steve JN BBE have a unique history they were all in the same Pentecostal Church uh uh and uh uh the brother that took the message to Liberia uh uh introduce the message to Brother Steve J BBE uh uh maybe brother Samu can tell you more of the story when he's here on Friday we might have him to speak Friday night and uh uh brother Simon at the time was a youth uh leader or a young preacher youth leader in the church so uh brother Steve Took the the little uh Lord God has spoken magazine that was preached by brother uh it was printed by Brother har H Bryan over in Canada those days it was a witness in material so he took it to brother Simon and uh there they were exposed to water B baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh uh so right in the in the Pentecostal Church they started creating an earthquake praise the Lord they started creating an earthquake brother Malachi uh brother William niman uh brother uh Alex nepe and uh uh a lot of those Brothers they were all part of that church uh uh Open Door Bible Church uh was a strong Pentecostal Church those days so uh right there they started creating an earthquake and most of those Brothers believed the message you know when they were exposed to the truth of water baptism and uh

chapter 52 Isaiah chapter 52 Isaiah chapter 52 now when you read Isaiah chapter 52 it's uh uh have 15 verses and uh we could do the whole uh reading the whole 15 verses but I would I would just read uh uh verse I'll read a verse or two but it holds a uh it holds a a prophecy it holds something that I I saw during the week uh in the scripture I don't know if I can be able to go into it but I took an inspiration to to preach from there so let's read from verse 7 uh let's read from verse 7 I we read from verse six therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that th speak behold it is I how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisher salvation

than we think oh God you come now Lord and bless us in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat this morning uh I want to take a thought from what we read entitled what we want to speak this morning how beautiful are the feet that bringeth good tidings how beautiful are the feet that bring It Good Tidings I I mentioned that when I said are the feet something came to my mind uh uh uh that's years back I can't remember the years now but uh uh we were there uh having uh uh um a civil crisis in our country and then we have left home you know we were you know driven from our home and uh I think there should be 92 or so alus whatever it was and uh we were in the were in the set town uh and then because of what was going on uh men of great statures everybody was trying to disguise thems you know dress simple you know and dress uh uh you know the the best simplest way that they can dress uh yeah that's I remember I said that how beautiful are the feet I remember my dad and uh so I think he was wanted to go out he was trying to walk up the street so he took uh one of my sister's Sanders it was an elas elastic Sanders he took the Sanders and he wore the Sanders you know he just pulled the elastic back and he snap on his feet and he went with his with his friend in the walking up the road and um and and it was not too long and and then he was arrested by one of uh uh the malians and or Rebel of who called him and uh uh but then good enough uh one of uh the senior officer was able to identify my dad he knew him and then you know he caught up the the court so and uh but uh the boy told my father he says uh we shall know them by their feet you know because he he felt like it was strange for this for this man the way he's looking to be wearing Gil Sanders so he knew that he was trying to hide himself so when I just now when I read how beautiful are the feet it just snaap in my mind so I couldn't help but share the story with you but we're going to talk about different feet this morning amen how beautiful are the feet that bringeth good tidings that's what we want to speak about morning when I was reading this actually I was I was I was studying I was listening to a commentary on Isaiah chapter 52 and as I was uh listening and and studying and uh uh I realized that uh there is not an even let me say this there is not an even that is on this earth that is not mentioned in the bible praise the Lord amen there is not an even on this earth that is not mentioned in the Holy Scripture that's the reason why we believe that this is the word of God praise the Lord it cover the day of creation amen and onto the time that God is going to work work this whole earth away not only that time it cover I will return back to the Earth to walk on the arches of the wicked it cover the Millennium the 1,000 year reign that is our future we are looking up to that amen whatever we are planning for we are planning for that 1,000 years I don't know what you planning to do but U I'm working on my plans and then it also cover after a thousand year rain with Christ a cover inity praise the Lord amen so as I was reading the the year there is something that that that caught my mind and I want to share with you uh I I will not have the time but uh if you if you look at the last verse you look at the last verse of Isaiah 52 that's verse 15 so shall he sprinkle many nations the Kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see for that which have not been told them shall they see and that which they have not heard shall they consider now this this is a this is a prophecy and then that goes right into Isaiah chapter 53 now in the in the new New Testament Church or the beginning of the New Testament Church there is an event of Isaiah 53 that have to do with the Ethiopian unic now if you read Isaiah 52 carefully and with lot of prayers you will see that the prophet Isaiah prophesy of Acts chapter 8 praise the Lord because it was Isaiah 53 the Ethiopian Uno was reading when Phillip was drawned to his chub are we together amen and uh uh uh but it it would take us a whole lot of uh Bible studies this morning it will take us a whole a whole lot of a Bible study but think about this look at verse 12 for for ye shall go not out with his none go by flight for the Lord will go before you and the god of Israel will be your re reward Philip joined that man from a Revival he never went by haste he never went by flight but God took him from Samra Revival and throw him on the desert praise the Lord man uh I mean uh it blew my mind some of the things I were looking at it blew my mind but we that's not way we we want to go into this uh this morning we can do it another time if the Lord will give us but we want to look at how beautiful at the feet of them that bring good Tiding now the thought really hait me spending time with Pastor Martin this gone week that he was here with us and uh uh uh uh we we had a good Fellowship together I mean this is this one of the time that we real that remember uh uh that was 2011 or before 2010 that that might have been one of the last revi uh uh convention I preach in uh uh in Nigeria before I travel I don't I don't remember but I was over in Abuja uh going for that meeting no that was not the last one that was my first time on that meeting I was in abja uh uh uh trying to get a a visa to Romania I was supposed to travel to Romania so I was working on my Visa and uh uh and uh you know and the brother that I was with he told told me what I'm going for the Easter meeting do you want to come and go with me I said well okay if I stay you know uh uh till that time I will go then and uh uh but then uh not being the dream but I had a dream and in the dream I I greeted Pastor Martin you know we we met and I greeted him it was so strange to me I was say wow you know I woke up in the morning but then we went for the meeting the exact thing happened you know he came and then uh and and and agree to him did not remember the dream until that thing took place and uh but he's he's a man that we love uh we don't know him we love him we appreciate him and uh uh for his uh his uh his St in the word amen for his St in the word so we had a good Fellowship but while we were fellowshipping together spending time together the thought his mean you know how beautiful are the feet that brings Good Tidings so then I went to start uh uh looking at it and uh that was what put put me into Isaiah chapter 52 and uh and I want to share some of uh uh uh that with you this morning praise the Lord I also had a had a time that I believe that was that was designed by the Lord we went out and then while we were coming I thought okay I would just we just go somewhere and then I will try to get some few things for him and then we went and then uh uh you know uh uh I just try to get some on the shirt for him and and then I just saw him as his as as his uh I said pastor Martin said you know what if if there's something you want take it and that thing almost broke the old man down because he remember his son son you know we came home no Sunday morning when we were driving to church we that happened on Saturday and then Sunday when we were coming to church and we were talking on something and then he said he says brother one what you did yesterday he says you never know what that means to me and I mean he started crying I was just I was just overwhelm so it was a good time for me praise the Lord enjoy the preaching if you did enjoy it but I enjoy the fellowship and uh uh but how beautiful are the feet that brings Good Tidings in Matthew in uh St John Chapter 13 Jesus at the end of his ministry he introduced to the church one of the greatest event that took place in history praise the Lord now that I said this I remember uh uh December 31st will turn out to be on the Sunday so we will see what the weather will bring for us but I'm hoping that we will have a morning service and I want us to have a communion service in the evening we might not stay late after the the whole uh uh December 31st Church tradition to stay until the next morning if we will have two services that day we might not stay uh uh late till the next morning uh because uh uh uh if we if I have to preach in the morning and then stay till the next day and uh uh uh it tells on my body praise the Lord so uh let's just pray that's that's what I'm having on my heart that uh uh if if the weather don't turn out to be rough if the weather turned out to be rough we will cancel the morning service and then we will come sometime in the afternoon and then we just go on with the service but I will wish that we'll have a time of communion and have a time of foot washing because I'm about to talk about foot washing that was one of the greatest evening that Jesus introduced to the New Testament Church if you look in the Bible the first time the Bible will speak about a feet being watch was Genesis 18 when when when Elohim came to visit Abraham praise the Lord concerning the promised son when Elohim came down Abraham said let me uh he says let a little water I prayed you be Fetch and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree he was talking to the angel that have come uh uh to visit him the second time the the scripture will talk about that it was when the two angels went to meet lot in Genesis chapter 19 lot said the same thing he says uh uh I prayed you I prayed you into your servant's house and TI all night and I'll wash your feet and you shall rise up early and go your way praise the Lord amen the next time the the scripture we talk about uh uh the washing of feet was uh uh the marriage of Isaac and Rebecca when Ela went to Rebecca parents to go and engage Rebecca for Isaac that the next time that the Bible will talk about feet watching it have now started becoming uh uh a tradition is now started becoming a custom among them that uh they will wash the feet of their guest the next time the Bible will address there will be when Joseph Brothers came to Egypt and Joseph sent the Egyptians to bring his brother into the palace he instructed them to wash their feet praise the Lord amen are we together praise the Lord and uh then we we see over in exodor feet took a different path and and it represented Redemption when God came down uh uh in Exodus chapter 3 he spoke to Moses he said draw not night hether put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where On th standed is a Holy Ground you know like I said the last time sometimes you just take the the concordance in your Bible or on your Bible app just put in the word go through the scripture and see uh you know well it will just blow your mind it will just blow your mind because it comes out in different way the next time will be when Zapora circumcised her son and took the forse skin and threw it at the feet of Moses a sign of the cross praise praise the Lorden and she said what a bloody husband thou are to me how beautiful are the feet that bringeth good tidings I don't know what's the size of your feet but I'm going to talk about your feet this morning amen praise the Lord amen your feet might not be beautiful pray maybe you didn't do cutting of the nails or the you know all the special things you do on your feet but how beautiful are the feet of them that bring Good Tidings praise the Lord are we together amen so it's a it's uh it's uh uh it's a great event you remember in Matthew chap 13: 7 Jesus told the disciples he said what I do unto you now ye know that but ye shall know after the Bible says after supper he took a towel and he tired it around himself he took a basin and he put water in it and uh and and and then he got down to the disciples he started washing their feet and weing it and and uh uh and he get a Peter Peter said no don't don't don't watch me was my whole body now Peter said watch my whole body because Peter was speaking about a Leviticus order because that's how the priest was introduced into the levitical priesthood they will first be watched Moses had to was them he would take a basing a very big top like the one we can do baptism in or maybe bigger than that and then he will pour water in it he will wash them from head to their feet and then uh uh before the congregation and they will come out of the water to go in there and change and then he will go uh uh uh uh uh and dress them in their in their Priestly Rob and he will bring them before the congregation and he will anoint them God was setting an order where uh uh uh it will have to take a prophetic Ministry to be able to bring a man into the pries to which is the fful ministry amen praise the Lord that's the reason why if a man will be uh uh h a successful fful Minister under the order of God for the New Testament he have to sit down and be watched God did it to Paul God had to watch Paul from all his tradition from all his Pharisees IDE did Tak him at the backside of the desert of Arabia for three years praise the Lord amen so that's what Peter was thinking about he was thinking about the Leviticus order I need to be watched Jesus said no he that is watch is watch Once amen now you will have to realize that under the Leviticus order when the priest is watched complete body he's watched once but every time of the sacrifice there was the lava sir before the brazing altar yes sir so before he goes to the sacrifice he will have to wash his hands and wash his feet it was something that they did every time praise the Lord so you see that's what we do when we come to the house of the Lord every service we come for a feet washing praise the Lord because we are we come to be reminded how to walk before the Lord how to walk with one another yeah are we together so Jesus said in St John chapter 13 verse 7 he said what I do unto you you know that but you will know here after here after you will know that and Paul will take that in Ephesian chapter 5 he will take there in Ephesians chapter 5 let's read it together because we're traveling now amen we're traveling now we want to see how beautiful our feet are praise the lord we spend a lot of time making our head and we don't know our will feet it are beautiful praise the Lord amen while you looking at your head God is looking at your feet are we together Ephesians chapter 5 love the Lord praise the Lord what a wonderful Jesus we Ser amen oh I love the Lord he's so good amen let's look at verse 24 in Ephesians chapter 5 now in Ephesians chapter 5 Paul speaking there before he gets to verse 24 and he's talking all of these things about uh uh uh you know uh uh he gets down and and talk about uh wife submit yourself to your husband and you know husband love your wife and then I mean we can get in there and then we become so personal but Paul is going to make us to understand Jesus said you will know Hereafter Paul being the prophet Messenger to the New Testament Church is now going to bring an interpretation to what Jesus said you will know herea are we together amen amen because that's what a prophet is he's a Divine interpreter of the word glory be to God now so Paul here teaching the Ephesian church he he says this and uh it talks about the wife and husband and all of that you can go and read it and then you fuss with yourself but that's fine verse 24 he said therefore as the church is subject to Christ now he's bringing it from the natural to the spiritual to be able to give us an idea but sometimes we get so stuck in the natural as soon as we start to say that and and and sometimes it's easy for us to start putting up a spirit of resentment and you won't get the blessing because he's driving to something praise the Lord amen he's just giving us a picture he says therefore as the church is subject to Christ so let the wife be to their own husband in everything husband love your wife even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the watching of Water by the word this is what Jesus said you will know Hereafter what I do unto you now he says you don't know but year after when the Holy Ghost will come every time you come to church I will be watching you amen amen every time you will have the watching of the Water by the word and that's what we come to church for yes Lord amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen amen and if you remember Jesus before his uh his crucification that will be in uh uh uh St John chapter 12 but Jesus stood there over in Matthew you remember Matthew 26 you remember when uh when when when Mary brought that Alabaster bus and and and you know she she she washed the Lord Jesus feet with her tears and and she break the box and and anointed him and and he made this statement he said wherever the gospel will be preached this is done unto my Memorial praise the Lord amen whever the gospel will be preach you just think about that M Mar Anointed The Lord after watching his Fe anointed him even before he came and did this in in in St John Chapter 13 to the disciples praise the Lord you see how how how powerful God is in his design you realize that if you are familiar with some of those things around the seals even before the seals were open there were people that that God gave dream and and and and even uh uh uh uh oh what what's the sister name she had a dream and and and and all of that was leading to the opening of the seals right all of that helped brother brandham to realize that uh this is what is happening all of those dreams brought him to the realization that this is what is happening that this woman will come and then uh get down on her knees and and and and weep and wash the feet of our Lord Jesus use her head and and wept his feet and and anoint him uh uh with with this costly oil and he would remember that now as the sacrifice of the word I'm I'm I'm now preserved as a priest I'm now being watched and now being anointed I can now go and step into that office to offer the sacrifice of the word praise the Lord when all the clergy and and and and and Pharisees priests they were all there but yet a woman got him ready for the job a woman got him ready for the job it's one of the greatest events church and that's why we are here let me read this to you the report reproach for the ca of the word I put this year to to kind of read it as an introduction of what I want to speak this morning because I want to I want to stay do my best to stay the uh in line now with what I want to stay with my inspiration I get not to get too SASS and running all over the place God has a time and a reason for that time to fulfill his word God know just exactly what he's doing what he's going to do sorry we done he he just have to receive it as he gave it to us we just have to receive it as he gave it to us he knows and there is nothing going to go wrong with what he has planned to do praise the Lord that's the reason why God do not worry amen God do not worry there is one thing that God can do he cannot do he can learn God cannot learn no because he knows everything he knows the end from the beginning amen praise the Lord nothing going to go wrong with what God has planned to do even with the word with what everything that is happening and everything that is going on nothing is going going to go wrong God is in control amen praise the Lord because God has a purpose for everything that he's doing Hallelujah am we can rest assur on that there has to be something rocket and high things to only bring out the real truth nature of the object you know rain is born in the r uh red lightning and tunder skies and if we didn't have rain we wouldn't have life but you see what it takes to bring rain thunder lightning flashing like anger and out of there comes rain a sea Must Die Rod corrupt smell and go back to the dust of the Earth in order to bring for New Life it takes the pounding of God turning over and over back and forth and pounding until all the drust is taken out of eight praise the Lord think about that that is just nature but think about yourself because just the way that God deals with nature that's the way he's dealing with every one of us for him to be able to bring his purpose out of your life he got to turn you around he got to put you back on the wheels he got to cause this to happen and cause that to happen just to be able to get he's he the one that made us amen praise the Lord amen the sooner we come to that realization the easy life will become for us you don't have a choice you didn't choose your birthday praise the Lord you can't choose the day you will die either you can until his purpose is done you're not going anywhere if you didn't know that let me tell you now amen until his purpose is done you are not going anywhere fighting to have your own way you are just building a little time of regret for Yourself Praise the Lord because whether you like it or not God is going to have his way yes sir in your life whether you like it it's not your choice is his choice it's his choice if you want it let's put it to the challenge your choice against his choice are we together not because his Shine the iron he says uh what is known as full gold shines like rear gold but to put the two together you see them out to one side you can hardly tell them apart but P them together you can tell it and the be the be always has to be till he sees or the beater sorry has to beat till he see his own image reflecting in the God and God set a time and has a purpose for everything he does there is nothing happened just accidentally to those who love of the Lord and Accord according to his purose see we are predestinated and everything work just right for that because he cannot lie he said that he said that was so and everything has a Time Ecclesiastes said it has a season and it has its way and God is behind every move praise the Lord every move every step of our life God is behind it praise the Lord amen we get to the end of the road before we realize oh wow God was behind it but he knew ever since that he was behind it praise the Lord before you even start the journey he knew he was behind every move and sometimes you think that everything is going wrong it's up to us that's how we think those things are put upon us triers and wondering is testing to see how we will react to an action and remember the reproach of the word the word has always bought a reproach All Through the Ages God anointed word has always been reproached and that's the reason it's so are for people who doesn't understand who know how to accept that reproach because I mean that's that's the way the the the sa Church the word says it I mean you serving God everything must be easy and now I'm serving God why why people don't understand there is a reproach that comes with the word amen it's not you being reproached it's is he being reproached praise the Lord and because you have joined yourself unto him or he have called you amen now you are bearing the reproach amen praise the Lord but if you would just remind yourself that this one that has been reproached since time has never lost a battle if you would just remind yourself that this one that have been reproached All Through the Ages has always come as Victorious if you would just remind yourself there and tell yourself pretty soon we will turn the corner can you remember the disciples returning back and rejoicing because the figure that they were counter water to stand the reproach of his name he said all that live Godly in Christ shall bear persecution reproach for the word you always have to stand this reproach in order to to give your testing see every man that come to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for so the trials and all of that that's your child training all of those things are just growing pains praise the Lord they are just growing pains there is nothing you you can do about it I mean when a child is teating they get fever there's nothing you can do about it there is no way you can stop that from happening there is no medication you can get let me prepare you so when your teeth is coming out you will not you will not get fever I mean don't do it you will kill the child that's right Hallelujah there is nothing you can do about it it's all part of your life Journey the sooner you start to embrace it and thank God the better life becomes for you are we together remember if he call you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening praise the Lord if God call you to bear his name to be a son and daughter of God there is nothing that will stop it sir from happening yes sir amen there is nothing that will stop it from happening the thief on the cross had his day and that was the last moment of his life when he says what we did we are guilty of Faith this man never did anything how did he know if he call you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening there's not enough devil in tth but what God word will be made manifest you are born for a purpose and nobody praise the Lord amen can we read that together you are born for the purpose you are born for a purpose and nobody can take your place praise the Lord nobody can take your place nobody can take your place praise the Lord nobody can take your place that's how God made this body every member of the body has its importance praise the Lord nobody can take your place and you have to what I want to establish is that we have to realize that that is God's word it has a reproach that comes with f amen but because it is God's word god spoken word it will have to bring forth of its kind yes sir praise the Lord you might have impersonations and everything else but they will never take your place right God's word will Triumph it cannot fail there is where every Christian ought to stand knowing that that just my introduction God bless you it's good to see you this morning let's get into our thought because I thought of trying to bring this this way way so we will be able to see and appreciate what we are called to what we are called to praise the Lord let me tell you we are not making a church we are not coming together to make a church the church of the Lord is never made by men Jesus said I will build my church and the gats of Hell shall not Prevail against it am praise the Lord amen amen we not coming together to make a church and uh you know uh uh uh and you know and and and do things that will make us happy no no no it's it's God that have called us praise the Lord he has called us together and there's no way you can get away from it try it I challenge you to try it now so when you look through the scripture you will see all of these different example that I gave of of God allowing this thing to happen yeah those angels came down to Abraham there and he choose to wash their feet and make them to feel welcome it became an eting cultured and and you know what and we we know about the foot wash flunky you know and and and all of that you know where they they come to the house and they have a Bott bucket or the tub there where you wash your feet and then you go in in the house and all of that but you will see that uh God kind of introduced that and here is said that uh uh the scripture that will introduce the Messiah Jesus Christ the greatest sacrifice of the word the the the Jews in the Torah called Isaiah 53 as the Hest the the holiest of holy of the scripture that's how they they term it that is the holiest of of holy of the entire scripture Isaiah chapter 53 and here is the prophet introducing the suffering seven praise the Lord he's introducing God becoming flesh to take upon himself the sin of the word he will be rejected by his own people but it will it will still not bother him praise the Lord and yet the prophet is introducing it as how beautiful are the feet that bringeth good tidings praise the Lord how beautiful are the feet that sound that salvation are we together praise the Lord now as I was looking at that I started to look at uh uh we know that over in in uh uh in Joshua ver make us to understand that firststep mean possession praise the Lord and then when I was looking at it in uh uh it also bring that out that four step is is uh uh possession but it also had a uh uh another uh definitions I want for us to look at it a little bit here this uh this morning praise the Lord are we together amen now so and you see that all through the scripture you see that and and and uh many times the the the message messenger that brings the message right from Eden the Bible says that uh uh uh the voice of God was walking in the garden calling out Adam Adam where are you the Bible mentioned walking and that will give us an idea that God was bringing that message on feet amen if the voice of God was walking he was bringing that message on feet how beautiful are the feet of them that bring It Good Tidings when in a strong concordance when you look at feet it says as used in Walking By by implication of steps it speaks of being able to endure praise the Lord you hear the word that says stay like a man Faith speaks of being able to endure according as coming is also speak as following the great told jinning it speaks of possession and time how beautiful are the faith that brings good Tiding praise the Lord to realize that this is not only speaking about the mesiah is not only speaking about the preachers in Romans chapter chapter 10 let's turn to Romans chapter 10 Paul used that also in Romans chapter 10 he referred to this very scripture that we are talking about you will see how he he plac it there Romans chapter 10 let's read from verse 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call upon Him whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher yes sir and how shall they preach except they be sent right as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel praise the Lord now you see Paul after the crucification he's bringing that very prophecy in a different way making us to realize that when God call us and he choose us it's for a purpose it's not just to come and warm the bench it's not just to you know uh uh H uh feel indifferent God do not have no less part of his body God do not have no useless part of his body every part of God's body is important that Paul will say even the ones that causing trouble he says they are necessary that's what he said in the book of Corinthians even the ones that are the Troublemaker they are necessary are we together how beautiful this message of Salvation that God been sending right down from Eden the seed of the woman the the the cherubin coming and protecting the tree of life and he's sending Abraham with a son of promise and Moses coming with deliverance and Joshua putting the people in the promised land David Rising as a king after God's Own Heart Solomon building the Temple feet he just using one feet to another feet and all he's doing he's bringing his message of Good Tidings choosing different men from different background praise the Lord think about it how will God why how how will he choose Solomon to build his Temple where the Shak Glory will come endur the beauty of Solomon Temple was the people they never only heard about what the pillow of fire and the pillow of cloud was but they saw it with their eyes because the Shak Glory har in the Tabernacle they could see it with their eyes am but this man mother his D fell with his mother in adultery BBA huah was killed and the scripture never change the language every time it talks about her it says uriah's wife praise the Lord right God never designed H H you know a loving H H story uh with with both of them and everything went well and it got married and Solomon was born God never designed that he went right into an adulterous pass but yet he raised up a son yes sir he raised up a man that he endure with wisdom praise the Lord it shows that when God choose a feet he do not looks at the pelic and the medic he just look at what you the message that you have to carry out praise the Lord whether your toes NS is called weekly or is God he does that does not matter to God what matter to God is that there's a message that must go out oh how beautiful are the feet that brings Good Tidings amen hallelujah I don't know what you doing with your feet though I don't know what you're doing with your feet how you looking at your feet praise the Lord amen read

the purpose is to bring you good tidings praise the Lord I mean you can do that by practicing it you can't watchh a man's side and say I got to do J that brother praise the Lord amen when uh when when uh brother Andrew glav preached I mean that that that young man he having so much energy amen there is not even room here for him to spin around he always spin around there's no room here for him to spin around he had to hop on his foot and spin around that that's his timey praise the Lord the moment you start pulling on the gift you bring out what is in the man praise the Lord amen and then Pastor Martin comes he preach like somebody talking to his [Music] children I enjoy him doing that amen amen even home back home that's how he preach you know he just keep knocking on this thing singing his song you see the thing that that that worry us is that we get so up in language we want we want hear new words we want hear Fancy call that's not a Ministry the character of the ministry is a life of dedication sir a life of consecration a man can pull a bunch of coats and bugs and bugs if he does not have an A A consecrated life he will just play on our minds oh wow oh whoo oh it does not bring no effect right is the Life of Christ behind that Ministry a man that is able to put himself before God Amen that we keep his face before God and say God speak to your people take me out of the way if there is anything that is in my life let it not be a hindrance to the people amen that's somebody that will come from the bed of cheating and lying right and then come and spin the head of the people the ministry is a life of consecration praise the lord it's not a business that's why brother BR said businessman should get out of the poopit because all they are concerned about is just taking their Millions that's right and how to get into the pockets of the people but if it is God's church God know how to take care of his people praise the Lord he knows how to take care of his people Lord how beautiful are the feet that brings good tidings I struggled yesterday because I I I wanted to take this from the place of the prophecy and and bring it where we all will see that I mean we will look at our feet at the end of the service praise the Lord amen the next time you are watching your feet praise the Lord amen and even when we have communion and feet watching sometimes people become so uh you know they become so Choice say W Feed they can watch W Feed they can watch you better get out of that praise the Lord if you have not washed someone feet is that person you should be running after it's that person that you should be running after is now your rep feet that you like to watch praise the Lord because you see even though it's a is it's an ordinance that the lord gave to us but he gave it to us for a reason he gave it to us for a reason that is the reason why we come into death by water baptism only them that are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are introduced into that oiness that's what the church is that's what we try to do when you say sister God bless you you are watching her feet praise the Lord is the watching of the Water by the word I'm praying for you amen I don't know what you going through but I'm praying for you you don't have to know everything amen that's why you are not called to wash their whole body you don't have to know everything praise the Lord and sometimes we just want to know because we want to talk let me read this to you then we'll find a place to close here how beautiful are the Fai that brings Good Tidings question and answered in Genesis we want to do something young our duty and if you are really born again of the spirit of God and says that's my duty to go to church I guess I have to go oh my well I want to do more than that I want to win some souls for Christ I want to do something I want to visit the sake or do something for him it's my duty to preach feral it's my duty to preach the gospel it's my duty to pray for the sake let me do something else let me get out and do something where God will honor Me by it praise the Lord sometimes we take coming to church just as a duty but it's more than there praise the lord it's more than that knowing that we coming for one reason we're coming to to fellowship and meet with our maker praise the Lord amen you know uh we we we turn to be very classic you know and people say brother B says three things that make you the member of the church your presence your offering your tithe I'm fulfilling all of that I think you know I'm I'm I'm in good standing but yet there is more to do praise the Lord there is more to do and there is lot that you can do behind the scenes there is lot that you can do behind the scenes for sure we come here we meet here Wednesday night Sunday morning I know for the fact there are people that comes and try to get the building ready after the while we we being a time where we went back and forth and we put schedule up and we you know we contact people But as God sometimes we work you know men order and Men strive we try to get ourself into it sometimes God don't use those things you come around and he will put burdens on people heart praise the Lord Sometimes some of the the the the the the scenes that do the sounds and things they come early before 10:00 because I was scheduled say 10:00 that that uh uh uh uh life thing is going to go life they try to be here before that time run through here I was here the other day and seeing one of the sisters doing there running through making sure that everything is connected and all of that praise the Lord how beautiful their feet bringing Good Tidings amen and all of the different things and even the things we do when we are not in church we have to realize that that commandment when the scripture says Thou sht not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain thou sht not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain and when you say you are a Christian you are taking the name of the lord it's not just what you say it's not just swearing that is ambassadorship that you will be joined to the name of Jesus Christ and we will take his name to places that we go things that we say things that we talk about he promised I will not leave you he said I will not leave you you just got a partner that tell you say I will not leave you where you going he say I will go there with with you I mean that's why we will not go to the club because we can't take Jesus to the club he said I will not leave you well sometimes we take him to places he still right at the door and wait for you to go have your fun and then as soon as you get back then he start dealing with your conscience say you just left me outside I told you that I will not leave you I will not forsake you Jesus never forsake right he never forsake his ambassadorship is not just misusing the name of God for all them that call on the name of Jesus all them that I have taken on his name that's what the Apostle Paul says when you take on his name as a Son of God as a daughter of God and your feet become beautiful why because he expects you by your manner of Life your conversation to bring good Tiding you are now on a mission you have become a Good News Messenger not a messenger of gossip and fces and evil speaking of you become a messenger of good news so if you don't have nothing good news to say then don't say anything right am look people that's what we are C that's what Christianity is about it's not joining the church no it's about you being an ambassador it's about you bearing the name of Jesus Christ even when you are to yourself even when it is you and your phone when it's you and your cell phone I didn't want it to be on evangelist I wanted to preach like a pastor this morning praise the Lord I don't know what the enery is coming from but I was I was praying I said Lord I don't I don't want to go into you know prophecy and start is chasing this scripture here the scripture I said Lord I'm I'm doing just like the disciples did Jesus said let's feed these people the disciples said Lord there was only a Le here with bread he said bring it the disciple went and got the bread from the little boy give it to Jesus he lift it up he blessed it and he gave it back to them I told the Lord I say take this little thought on my heart let me be able to speak to the people tomorrow not to run all over the place and run you through a lot of scriptures and through lot of Prophecy I mean we could spend we could spend the rest of the year in Isaiah 52 but there are a lot of beautiful things there but just to be able to think that prophecy how beautiful are the feet that bring Good Tidings praise the Lord to know that when God called a man or God called a woman and as he have gathered us from different backgrounds and different life and different upbringing to be able to achieve his purpose are we driven to the thought of why why are we here are we driven to that thought why do we come here I mean there are other nice churches around this place is just like a box why do we come here are we able to follow just in the past month what has the spirit been saying to the church we have all these brothers come around and they come to visit and you know they come and and we allow them to preach for us and uh I mean it's it's it's it's it's not just like uh you know uh trying to you know uh uh just just get somebody into to change the Flor what are we doing what are we achieving or are we just hoping that the next service will be better than this one because this one is too boring this guy should be preaching to us he's talking about feet you just got to go work in a nail salon what are we trying to achieve what are we doing here praise the Lord when we see some of the different changes and different and uh uh uh uh uh uh things that are happening and and different attitudes and even sometimes of our young people and I know you know sometimes people you know they think they're the preacher the pastor should come I mean you know I really think that he should say something about this praise the Lord don't be God to me amen don't be God to me if you see a situation is concerning to you prayed about it just prayed about it because it's very easy for for you to to tag me and just point on your board I'm waiting for him to deal with this praise the Lord amen or you want to come and talk to me feel free come and talk to me maybe I might show you something that you have not seen I might show you another side that you are not looking at every feet that walk through those doors and come in this building the Lord sees it as a beautiful feet every feet that walk through those doors and come in this building no matter what they they put on no matter what their background is for the fact that only God knows whether they are attracted here by a person or they are attracted here by the music or they are attracted only God knows what is attracting them here so if we would take the time to watch one another faith when you get in your prayer closet every time you pray for the brother you pray for the sister you know what you're doing you washing their feet you are helping them in their work supernaturally not knowing what they are dealing with not knowing what they are going through you just think about that woman coming right there in the house of Simon right there and and that was not the only time that she did that right there in the house of Simon with everybody looking at her she didn't care like I said on Wednesday night even to our young people you can dress cute and you know nice we love you but until God bring to your heart the need of a savior until you start to feel in yourself the need of a savior praise the Lord that's where the birth begin yes sir when you start to feel the need I need to be safe I need to change praise the Lord if not Church would just be a show off place for you you show off you show out you are on the the schedule praise the Lord but how beautiful are the feet you know what you do to a preacher after he have prayed and he have studied and and wait on the Lord and to come and meet a group of people sitting waiting to preach he's struggling to convey the thought and he want to achieve something you look at the time the time is going it's getting late he's striving but yet you are there and you are saying amen and you are saying thank you Jesus you know what you do to a preacher you know what will happen to a preacher if he just come into a church and you just put up a wall of resentment praise the lord we owe it to the Lord we don't know it's not you it's not anybody we owe it to the Lord there is not one preacher that comes in this little place and preach and don't say brother one you have a a good group of people they love the word amen I believe he's the one that pul that energy in us for us to be able to receive the word because that's all we want we want the word don't give us your personality give us the word that's right yes sir if you want to kill the preacher just reject him that's why put Jesus on the cross it was rejection Jesus Jesus died from rejection more than the nails that went through his hands it was not the nails it was his own creatures rejecting him and said crucified him if you want to kill your children reject him just a sense of rejection to your wife to your husband to a brother or a sister to a stranger that just come in our gates that don't know what you believe they don't know your standard they just come to Fellowship yes and you sh a sense of rejection because you just fill up with your religious clothes and You Think You Are Holy and better than them and you will not reach out to say oh God bless you thank you for coming am amen when you lose the need for a savior you are on the wrong path yes sir when you are not feeling that thing in your heart that you need God you better ask for help I'm earnestly telling you I'm not preaching to you I'm earnestly telling you if you are coming here and you don't feel the need or for Sav you please ask for help let's buy with
