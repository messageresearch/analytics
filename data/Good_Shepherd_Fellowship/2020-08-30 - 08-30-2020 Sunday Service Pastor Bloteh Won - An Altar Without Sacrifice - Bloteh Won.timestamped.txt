[30:45] we just
[30:46] want to read some uh or remind
[30:50] you or make coming like we will say
[30:53] then
[30:57] i heard brother hillary uh reading this
[31:00] uh
[31:02] concerning the the sisters prayer
[31:05] meeting
[31:06] it's just a sister's prayer meeting not
[31:09] from a sister's
[31:10] department women department amen
[31:13] now you have to remember that uh
[31:17] at the end of july we
[31:20] we taught a while that we were going to
[31:23] uh
[31:23] have couple of prayer meetings i make
[31:26] mention
[31:27] about the young people prayer meeting
[31:30] that we were planning we wanted to have
[31:32] a
[31:33] a kind of uh like a like an
[31:37] all night just for the young people amen
[31:40] that run from uh from a young age to 99
[31:44] you know if you can stand the night but
[31:48] i've been thinking about it and what i
[31:51] don't want to do
[31:52] is uh
[31:57] just to i want to bring you together for
[32:00] us to have
[32:01] a good time in the lord for us to have
[32:05] fun
[32:05] enjoy ourselves because that's what we
[32:08] should do
[32:09] as children of god but
[32:12] i also you know we've been talking about
[32:15] watching our steps as we go into
[32:18] the presence of the lord so they have
[32:22] made me to be thinking over this
[32:26] and while we think about
[32:29] uh finding the time i thought we would
[32:33] have done it
[32:34] this gone weekend and i did
[32:38] a couple of uh
[32:41] hotel preparation because
[32:44] we were going to come together uh have a
[32:47] time to sleep
[32:48] i was going to seize your cell phones
[32:51] and all of that
[32:52] but uh uh
[32:56] i kind of forgive myself some few talked
[32:58] about it
[32:59] why now started uh
[33:03] a prayer meeting uh in
[33:06] around like a saturday afternoon
[33:09] and see how much you can pray and how
[33:11] much you want to pray
[33:13] than bringing you and having everybody
[33:15] falling asleep on me
[33:18] oh i would be so mad praise the lord
[33:22] so and couple of other few things to
[33:26] uh uh i mean
[33:29] thinking and i will make comment on that
[33:32] we sent out a text message also
[33:36] for the couple's uh
[33:39] meeting we were going to that we wanted
[33:42] to do
[33:43] unfortunately i've not got response from
[33:48] many of the the couples as expected
[33:52] so i'm going to put that one on hold as
[33:56] well
[33:58] i think uh you know in in some way
[34:01] i would not want to say that maybe the
[34:04] cost of twenty dollars is expensive i
[34:06] don't i don't believe so
[34:08] i just believe that uh you know uh
[34:12] maybe you did not pay attention to it
[34:15] but
[34:15] uh that is something we we do
[34:18] every year where we we bring all the
[34:21] couples together
[34:23] and then we can talk i mean
[34:26] the menu part of it is just the least
[34:28] part of it but the fellowship
[34:31] and and the prayer time that we have
[34:34] is is very important and then
[34:38] we had a we had a brothers meeting
[34:42] which of course you know even at the
[34:45] time of that meeting few
[34:47] attended others
[34:51] maybe they forgot or you know they were
[34:54] busy
[34:54] but the thing about it there is that we
[34:56] know that we are busy
[34:58] some way somehow but we expect you to
[35:01] let us know
[35:02] if you will not be in the meeting or
[35:05] something come up let us know
[35:07] because uh you know that is just how the
[35:10] muscle would feel
[35:11] if we if we send out a message and and
[35:14] we never let you know
[35:16] you will not be happy about it so
[35:19] uh and then sometimes
[35:22] you know it's just just in that moment
[35:26] uh i will always go back to my general
[35:30] text to copy everybody that is in and
[35:33] send the message out
[35:35] and you see uh one of the things that is
[35:38] the other
[35:40] you know as a church as as we've been
[35:43] trying to talk about
[35:46] a church this is uh
[35:52] through our redemption through the blood
[35:54] of jesus christ
[35:56] this is the
[35:59] the closest family we have
[36:02] praise the lord and and that the
[36:05] the like i've said over and over the
[36:07] successful church
[36:09] a church will be successful
[36:12] because uh right from
[36:16] exeter when god told the children of
[36:19] israel
[36:19] he says build a tabernacle because i
[36:21] want to come down the door them on you
[36:23] and i will make you a family of priests
[36:27] you know so god's principle is
[36:30] kingdom principle now
[36:33] we are born in this in this uh
[36:37] a word of is democracy you know we face
[36:40] political
[36:42] parties and his presidents and different
[36:44] nations
[36:45] but the kingdom of god is not like that
[36:48] you know
[36:48] the kingdom of god that's the reason why
[36:50] over and over
[36:51] yeah the kingdom of god was never
[36:53] lacking unto a nation
[36:55] the kingdom of god was never lacking
[36:58] unto a tribe
[36:59] the kingdom of god was always lacking
[37:01] unto a kingdom
[37:03] because that's god's principle his
[37:06] principle
[37:07] is a kingdom principle and he alone
[37:11] rules he rings and we are all his
[37:14] subjects
[37:15] we are his children praise the lord
[37:18] and and and that also
[37:21] is uh is is uh is the purpose is the
[37:23] vision of the church
[37:25] man so while until the lord can be able
[37:28] to help us for us to be able to either
[37:30] grab
[37:31] that in a in a personal revelation and
[37:34] commit ourselves to aid
[37:37] i mean we would just uh uh
[37:40] we will be we will be doing just like
[37:42] the church war has done all through the
[37:44] years and it is
[37:45] all of those things that have breeded
[37:47] denominations
[37:48] that we have so many of them that we
[37:50] have lost count
[37:51] you know uh those years brother branham
[37:53] uses over 900 denominations but now and
[37:56] i can say we have lost count
[37:58] praise the lord so uh
[38:01] uh and and all of these things
[38:05] we we try to to encourage ourselves to
[38:08] do them
[38:09] uh uh just to bring us into
[38:13] fellowship with one another and also for
[38:16] us to
[38:16] appreciate you know the people that god
[38:19] has placed in our life
[38:21] as you know as a brother as a sister
[38:24] you know as our musicians as our
[38:28] officers and all of them and i believe
[38:31] that
[38:32] is the way we can grow as a church
[38:35] to be successful if we just think that
[38:39] the wednesday night and the sunday night
[38:41] services i
[38:42] uh you know it's all that we need for
[38:45] the church
[38:46] you are missing the match praise the
[38:48] lord amen
[38:50] you are missing the mag because what
[38:52] will happen is the other
[38:54] uh you will get a man that is a
[38:55] preaching machine
[38:57] and pretty soon he will run out of oil
[39:00] and then he will start formulating his
[39:02] own things
[39:03] you know because the spirit of god is
[39:06] not moving
[39:07] in the true in and through the people is
[39:09] just only one man
[39:11] and pretty soon you know uh different
[39:14] things can start happening
[39:16] so uh we have to pay attention to these
[39:18] things
[39:19] you know we have to pay attention to it
[39:21] uh uh
[39:22] you know when you think about things you
[39:25] you prepare for it
[39:26] and then you think that it will be
[39:28] something that people will appreciate
[39:31] and then nobody seems to or very few let
[39:34] me not say nobody
[39:35] you know very few uh uh
[39:38] thinks about it then in some way that
[39:42] uh it makes you to think whether you
[39:44] were doing the right thing or
[39:46] what's what's right what's actually is
[39:47] going on so
[39:49] uh this uh we were going to have brother
[39:52] prater
[39:53] and his wife coming in and we just
[39:55] thought that
[39:56] that would have been the time to you
[39:59] know
[39:59] uh just have our couple's prayer meeting
[40:02] but we will cancel it you know we'll
[40:06] cancel it uh
[40:07] uh for the coming weekend and then
[40:10] uh we will we will look for a better
[40:13] time
[40:14] again uh we look for the time to
[40:17] to be able to hold that and
[40:20] uh also the the
[40:24] young people prayer meeting just like i
[40:26] said uh
[40:27] we will we will also put the all night
[40:31] prayer meeting on hold
[40:33] for now and uh because
[40:36] there are just some few things that we i
[40:38] really want to get down
[40:40] uh you know to to the young people
[40:44] and uh which of course we're driving a
[40:46] few of them this morning
[40:48] as we uh as we
[40:51] trust the law to be able to help us so
[40:53] for the sisters prayer meeting
[40:55] uh i i dedicated to few
[40:58] sisters because what i wanted to evolve
[41:03] was making another preaching service for
[41:05] you
[41:06] i wanted to step out of it and have you
[41:09] sisters come together
[41:11] talk about the things that uh you know
[41:14] are concerning
[41:15] you know or things that you are sisters
[41:18] want to pray for
[41:20] what what you want as a church what you
[41:23] want as a church to bring your
[41:24] bring up your family in you know and
[41:27] encourage
[41:28] your friends co-worker to be part of
[41:31] you can just come together and and just
[41:34] have a time of praying
[41:36] and uh i also learned you know
[41:39] uh a text message was sent out if you
[41:43] did not get a text message then you can
[41:45] get back to us
[41:46] and maybe we don't have your number that
[41:48] is the reason why you did not receive
[41:50] the text message but as far as i know
[41:53] uh i gave them text i gave them numbers
[41:57] to send
[41:59] the information out and what i thought
[42:02] was
[42:03] you know people will make a uh
[42:06] a conversation out of it you know and
[42:08] then york will all
[42:09] talk and then find a time that will be
[42:12] suitable this thing is not a
[42:14] is just not a one night thing it is
[42:16] something that
[42:17] we want to grow ourself into because the
[42:20] house of god is the house of prayer amen

[45:13] and the half drive of manasseh and said
[45:15] unto them
[45:17] ye have kept all that moses the servant
[45:19] of the lord commanded you
[45:20] and have obeyed my voice and all that i
[45:22] commanded you
[45:23] ye have not left your brethren these
[45:25] many days unto this day
[45:27] but have kept the charge of the
[45:28] commandment of the lord your god
[45:31] and now the lord your god have given
[45:33] rest unto your brethren
[45:34] as he promised them therefore now return
[45:37] ye
[45:38] and get you unto your tents into the
[45:40] land of your possession
[45:41] which moses the serpent of the lord gave
[45:43] you on the other side jordan
[45:46] but take diligent heed to do the
[45:48] commandment and the law
[45:50] which moses the servant of the lord
[45:52] charged you
[45:53] to love the lord your god and to walk in
[45:55] all his ways
[45:57] and to keep his commandments and to
[45:59] cleave unto him
[46:00] and to serve him with all your heart and
[46:02] with all your soul
[46:04] so joshua blessed them and sent them
[46:06] away
[46:08] and they went unto their tents now to
[46:11] the one half of the tribe of manasseh
[46:13] moses had given possession in bashan but
[46:16] unto the other half thereof gave joshua
[46:18] among their brethren on this side jordan
[46:20] westwood
[46:21] and when joshua sent them away also unto
[46:23] their tents
[46:25] then he blessed them and he spake unto
[46:27] them saying
[46:28] return with much riches unto your tents
[46:32] and with very much cattle with silver
[46:34] and with gold
[46:36] and with brass and with iron and with
[46:39] very much raiment
[46:40] divide the spoil of your enemies with
[46:43] your brethren
[46:45] and the children of reuben and the
[46:46] children of god and the half
[46:48] tribe of manasseh returned and departed
[46:50] from the children of israel
[46:52] out of shiloh which is in the land of
[46:54] canaan to go
[46:56] unto the country of gilead to the land
[46:57] of their possession
[46:59] where they were possessed according to
[47:01] the word of the lord by the hand of
[47:02] moses
[47:04] and when they came unto the borders of
[47:05] jordan that are in the land of canaan
[47:07] the children of reuben and the children
[47:09] of god and half tribe of manasseh
[47:12] built there an altar by jordan a great
[47:14] altar to see to
[47:16] and the children of israel heard say
[47:18] behold
[47:19] the children of reuben and the children
[47:20] of god and the half tribe of manasseh
[47:23] have built an altar over against the
[47:25] land of canaan in the borders of jordan
[47:28] at the passage of the children of israel
[47:30] and when the children of israel heard of
[47:32] it
[47:33] the whole congregation of the children
[47:34] of israel gathered themselves together
[47:36] at shiloh
[47:37] to go up to war against them and the
[47:39] children of israel sent unto the
[47:41] children of reuben
[47:42] and to the children of god and to the
[47:45] half tribe of manasseh
[47:46] into the land of gilead the nehas the
[47:49] son of eleazar the priest
[47:51] and with him ten princes of each chief
[47:54] house of prince throughout all the
[47:55] tribes of israel
[47:57] and each one was and head of the house
[47:59] of their fathers among the thousands of
[48:01] israel
[48:03] and they came unto the children of
[48:04] reuben and to the children of god
[48:07] and to the half tribe of manasseh unto
[48:09] the land of gilead
[48:11] and they spake with them saying thus
[48:14] saith the whole congregation of the lord
[48:17] what trespasses this that ye have
[48:19] committed against the god of israel
[48:21] to turn away this day from following the
[48:23] lord in that ye have builded you
[48:25] an altar that ye might rebel this day
[48:27] against the lord
[48:28] is the iniquity of pure too little for
[48:30] us from which we are not cleansed until
[48:33] this day
[48:34] although there was a plague in the
[48:35] congregation of the lord
[48:37] but that ye must turn away this day from
[48:39] following the lord
[48:41] and it will be seeing ye rebel today
[48:43] against the lord that tomorrow he will
[48:45] be wrath with the whole congregation of
[48:47] israel
[48:48] notwithstanding if the land of your
[48:50] possession be unclean
[48:52] then pass ye over unto the land of the
[48:54] possession of the lord wherein the
[48:55] lord's tabernacle dwelleth
[48:57] and take possession among us but rebel
[49:00] not against the lord
[49:02] nor rebel against us in building you an
[49:04] altar beside the altar of the lord our
[49:06] god
[49:08] did not aiken the son of zero commit a
[49:09] trespass in the accursed
[49:11] thing and wrath fell on all the
[49:14] congregation of israel and that man
[49:16] perished not alone in his iniquity
[49:19] then the children of ruben and the
[49:22] children of god and the half tribe of
[49:23] manasseh answered and said unto the
[49:25] heads of the thousands of israel
[49:28] the lord god of gods the lord god of god
[49:31] he knoweth in israel he shall know
[49:35] if it be in rebellion or if in
[49:37] transgression against the lord save us
[49:38] not this day
[49:40] that we have built us an altar to turn
[49:42] from following the lord
[49:44] or if to offer their own burnt offering
[49:47] or meat offering
[49:48] or if to offer peace offerings thereon
[49:51] let the lord himself require it and if
[49:54] we have not
[49:55] rather done it for fear of this thing
[49:58] saying
[49:59] in time to come your children might
[50:00] speak unto our children saying
[50:02] what have you to do with the lord god of
[50:04] israel
[50:06] for the lord made jordan a border
[50:07] between us and you
[50:09] ye children of reuben and children of
[50:11] god
[50:13] ye have no part in the lord so shall
[50:16] your children make our children cease
[50:18] from fearing the lord therefore we said
[50:22] let us now prepare to build us an altar
[50:24] not for burnt offering
[50:26] nor for sacrifice but that it may be a
[50:29] witness between
[50:30] us and you and our generations after us
[50:33] that we might do the service of the lord
[50:35] before him with our burnt offerings
[50:38] and with our sacrifices and with our
[50:40] peace offerings
[50:42] that your children may not say to our
[50:43] children in time to come
[50:45] ye have no part in the lord therefore
[50:48] said we that it shall be when they
[50:50] should so say to us
[50:51] or to our generations in time to come
[50:54] that we may say again behold
[50:56] the pattern of the altar of the lord
[50:58] which our fathers made
[51:00] not for burnt offerings nor for
[51:02] sacrifices
[51:03] but it is a witness between us and you
[51:07] god forbid that we should rebel against
[51:09] the lord and turn this day from
[51:11] following the lord
[51:12] to build an altar for burnt offerings
[51:14] for meat offerings or for sacrifices
[51:16] beside the altar of the lord our god
[51:18] that is before his tabernacle and when
[51:21] fine house the priest
[51:22] and the princes of the congregation and
[51:24] heads of the thousands of israel which
[51:26] were with him
[51:27] heard the words that the children of
[51:29] reuben and the children of god
[51:31] and the children of manasseh spake
[51:34] it pleased them and fine house the son
[51:37] of elias are the priests
[51:38] said unto the children of reuben and to
[51:40] the children of god
[51:42] and to the children of manasseh this day
[51:45] we perceive
[51:46] that the lord is among us because ye
[51:48] have not committed this trespass against
[51:50] the lord
[51:52] now ye have delivered the children of
[51:53] israel out of the hand of the lord
[51:56] and fine house the son of eliezer the
[51:57] priest and the princes
[52:00] returned from the children of reuben and
[52:02] from the children of god
[52:04] out of the land of gilead unto the land
[52:07] of canaan
[52:08] to the children of israel and brought
[52:10] them word
[52:11] again and the thing pleased the children
[52:14] of israel
[52:15] and the children of israel blessed god
[52:18] and did not intend to go up against them
[52:20] in battle
[52:21] to destroy the land wherein the children
[52:23] of reuben and god dwelt
[52:26] and the children of reuben and the
[52:28] children of god call the altar
[52:30] ed for it shall be a witness between us
[52:34] that the lord is god
[52:37] amen let's stand on our feet uh hebrew
[52:40] chapter nine
[52:43] hebrew chapter nine
[52:53] hebrew chapter 9 let's read from verse
[52:55] 19
[52:58] for when moses have spoken every person
[53:02] to all the people are calling to the
[53:03] lord
[53:05] he took the blood of the calves and of
[53:08] the god
[53:09] with water and scarlet wood and hustle
[53:13] and he sprinkled both the book
[53:17] and all the people saying
[53:20] this is the blood of the testament
[53:25] which god has god hath enjoined
[53:28] unto you this is
[53:32] the book of the testament which god
[53:35] has enjoined unto you moreover
[53:38] he sprinkled with blood both the
[53:41] tabernacle
[53:42] and all the vessel of the ministry
[53:47] and almost all things
[53:50] are by the lord parched with blood
[53:55] and without sharing shedding of blood
[53:59] is no remission
[54:04] it was therefore necessary that the
[54:07] parting
[54:08] of things in the heaven should be
[54:12] purified with these but the heavenly
[54:15] things themselves
[54:16] are better sacrifices than these let's
[54:19] pray heavenly father

[57:10] will lead us
[57:12] and believing that you will be able to
[57:14] help us amen
[57:20] believing that he will be able to help
[57:22] us and we know that uh
[57:26] our god is our god is faithful praise
[57:28] the lord
[57:30] this morning the reason why we read that
[57:32] entire chapter
[57:34] is because there are series of things in
[57:36] that in that chapter
[57:38] that uh i'm hoping that we can be able
[57:40] to look at together
[57:42] and uh uh and just and just study a
[57:45] little
[57:45] a little bit i'm straightening off of
[57:47] the subject that we were talking about
[57:49] last sunday
[57:50] and we continue wednesday night where we
[57:52] were looking at uh
[57:54] the uh gauze family tree we were looking
[57:57] at the two sea lion
[57:58] and uh but this this caught my attention
[58:03] uh and i just thought that uh we can we
[58:06] can study it together
[58:09] uh you know trusting that the lord will
[58:11] be able to put his blessing upon
[58:12] it praise the lord amen we just we are
[58:16] so grateful
[58:18] praise the lord now as as we read the
[58:21] book of uh
[58:22] joshua let's uh let's just uh refer to
[58:25] that and give ourselves
[58:26] a picture uh this tribe the the people
[58:30] of god and ruben
[58:32] and half tribe of monastery joshua has
[58:35] called on to these people to come and
[58:37] help the
[58:38] the other brothers get their inheritance
[58:40] now we have to know that these were the
[58:42] tribes that that got their
[58:44] inheritance before the entire children
[58:47] of
[58:47] israel crossed over jordan joshua gave
[58:50] this tribe their inheritance their
[58:52] inheritance was on this side
[58:54] of jordan but he he asked them to go and
[58:57] help their brothers
[58:58] you know uh to to fight get you know get
[59:02] their inheritance in
[59:03] and after he had divided all the land
[59:07] and these people returned back to their
[59:09] place but now
[59:10] think about this now uh uh the children
[59:14] of ruben and and gath
[59:20] they were across the river and and and
[59:23] the tabernacle was
[59:24] shallow was on the other side of the
[59:27] river
[59:28] so uh if if the children of
[59:31] israel or the children of god needed to
[59:34] go
[59:35] to the tabernacle they have to go over
[59:37] jordan
[59:38] and there they go and make their
[59:39] sacrifices you know and everything
[59:41] because
[59:42] god was dealing with the people as a
[59:44] family he was keeping the tribes
[59:46] together
[59:47] now as as the as
[59:51] the the these people were returning back
[59:54] to the
[59:54] inheritance they realized that
[59:59] they are on this side of jordan the rest
[1:00:02] of the tribe is
[1:00:03] on the other side of jordan they they
[1:00:05] are far away in
[1:00:06] in one sense they are cut away from the
[1:00:08] people and they thought to themselves
[1:00:10] that it would be a good thing for us
[1:00:12] to build an altar that they called an
[1:00:16] altar of witness
[1:00:20] which of course the idea behind the
[1:00:23] altar of witness
[1:00:25] was that they would have a memorial
[1:00:28] for their children praise the lord
[1:00:31] are we together they will have a
[1:00:34] memorial
[1:00:35] so their children will
[1:00:38] remember all that the lord god of israel
[1:00:41] has
[1:00:42] done praise the lord now when
[1:00:45] israel heard that they have built an
[1:00:48] altar
[1:00:49] the first thing that came to their mind
[1:00:51] is that they want to start a
[1:00:52] denomination they want us they want to
[1:00:54] separate
[1:00:55] the people which mean they want to cut
[1:00:57] themselves away from us so
[1:00:59] we are not going to allow it so israel
[1:01:02] armed themselves and to go and challenge
[1:01:04] them if this is what you want to do
[1:01:06] we we will fight against you people just
[1:01:09] like our enemy
[1:01:10] and we will destroy your altar are we
[1:01:13] together
[1:01:14] praise the lord but when they got there
[1:01:17] and they realized
[1:01:18] and and and and the children of ruben
[1:01:21] and god said god forbid
[1:01:23] that is not what we want to do we are
[1:01:26] just building this
[1:01:28] uh uh we are building this altar
[1:01:31] so tomorrow you will not tell
[1:01:35] us that you know we are not part of you
[1:01:38] because
[1:01:38] now you have to remember in reading
[1:01:40] there they built the altar
[1:01:42] just according to the pattern
[1:01:45] the instruction that was given to moses
[1:01:48] they got
[1:01:49] a correct copy out of it
[1:01:52] amen they build it just according to the
[1:01:55] all
[1:01:56] i mean the the pattern that was given to
[1:01:58] moses
[1:02:00] and the owner wanted to have it as a
[1:02:02] witness
[1:02:03] oh we serve as a good idea then when
[1:02:06] they told the children
[1:02:08] of of of israel the rest of the tribe
[1:02:10] that this is what we want to do
[1:02:12] finney has said okay you have to
[1:02:14] remember now finney house is the one
[1:02:17] that that used a javelin and slaying
[1:02:20] that rebellious son of
[1:02:21] israel down in moab now he was already
[1:02:26] a commissioned into the priesthood so he
[1:02:28] was the one
[1:02:30] he was commissioned because god
[1:02:33] commissioned him because of the zeal
[1:02:35] that he had to
[1:02:36] to roll back the curse from the camp now
[1:02:39] so
[1:02:39] he hearing that these people are
[1:02:41] building a
[1:02:42] separate altar i mean he he i'm the
[1:02:45] people and he was the one you remember
[1:02:47] what god date
[1:02:48] did in the land of moab uh uh about
[1:02:51] poorer don't bring that don't bring that
[1:02:53] curse
[1:02:54] upon us you know in all of this he's
[1:02:56] telling the people and all of that
[1:02:57] but there are some things also that we
[1:03:01] have to look at when we look at closely
[1:03:04] because you see good ideas and good com
[1:03:08] opinion you know
[1:03:11] god don't bless all the time
[1:03:14] amen praise the lord it was a good idea
[1:03:19] for them to be able to build an altar to
[1:03:22] remind their children
[1:03:23] that was called the altar of
[1:03:28] witness
[1:03:30] praise the lord and you know what they
[1:03:33] told
[1:03:34] the children of israel also god forbid
[1:03:40] there are two things that we're going to
[1:03:42] keep away from this altar
[1:03:45] there will be no sacrifice there will be
[1:03:48] no burnt offering it's only for a
[1:03:52] witness
[1:03:54] praise the lord but i will tell you this
[1:03:56] morning if you don't have a sacrifice
[1:03:59] if you don't have a burnt offering you
[1:04:00] don't have a witness
[1:04:06] praise the lord now so you can see
[1:04:09] where we want to travel a little bit
[1:04:12] this morning
[1:04:13] if you don't have blood on your altar
[1:04:16] you don't have a witness
[1:04:21] because the testimony was a testimony of
[1:04:26] blood
[1:04:31] are we together praise the lord
[1:04:42] they had a very good idea they had a
[1:04:44] good they were
[1:04:45] it was a good plan it was a good you
[1:04:48] know for them
[1:04:49] for them for their children
[1:04:53] for their children to be able to
[1:04:56] remember
[1:04:59] the blessings of god for their children
[1:05:02] to be able to remember
[1:05:04] the commandments of the lord that was a
[1:05:08] good thing for them to build and
[1:05:10] alter
[1:05:14] but what good is it if you are not going
[1:05:17] to bring the full benefit
[1:05:22] what is good just to have like paul says
[1:05:28] he says to have the form of godliness
[1:05:33] and to deny the power thereof
[1:05:37] because honor the old coveted the power
[1:05:40] was in the sacrifice
[1:05:43] the power was not just in the altar
[1:05:48] the power was in the sacrifice the power
[1:05:51] was in the daily offering that was done
[1:05:54] upon the altar
[1:06:00] praise the lord as we as we as we study
[1:06:04] together you will see
[1:06:05] here uh what what happened
[1:06:08] to these people as the years went by
[1:06:13] you know as i was thinking about this
[1:06:16] just like talking about
[1:06:19] the the the young people prayer meeting
[1:06:22] and all of these things i just
[1:06:23] i was just thinking about what you know
[1:06:26] how to approach this how to go about
[1:06:28] this
[1:06:29] you know it's not just to have a prayer
[1:06:31] meeting is not
[1:06:32] just to have a young people meeting but
[1:06:34] what we want to do
[1:06:36] is to make this holy ghost gospel real
[1:06:41] amen we want our young people to see the
[1:06:45] evidence of the baptising of the holy
[1:06:48] ghost
[1:06:49] the importance of it
[1:06:54] that's that's what we want for them to
[1:06:57] be able to see
[1:06:58] the importance of it we want a memorial
[1:07:05] that that will never leave them and
[1:07:08] experience
[1:07:09] it's not just to punish them with you
[1:07:12] know
[1:07:12] god sent us a prophet you know brother
[1:07:14] branham was the prophet
[1:07:16] you know and and and we can say all of
[1:07:18] those things
[1:07:19] but if they have not come to that place
[1:07:21] of having an experience with god
[1:07:24] they will have all of the knowledge of
[1:07:26] this message and still walk away from me
[1:07:31] praise the lord they will have all
[1:07:35] of the knowledge of this message we have
[1:07:38] people
[1:07:38] that was right in the hands of brother
[1:07:40] branham he dedicated
[1:07:42] them erased right there in in the
[1:07:45] branham tabernacle and they knew him
[1:07:47] very well
[1:07:48] and and everything but because they
[1:07:51] never
[1:07:51] have blood on the altar
[1:07:57] they turn away from the very sacrifice
[1:07:59] that was given to us in this age
[1:08:05] are we together are you ready to go with
[1:08:07] me this morning amen
[1:08:10] praise the lord amen
[1:08:14] i mean we cannot get blood on the altar
[1:08:16] until a sacrifice is killed
[1:08:19] are you ready to kill the sacrifice this
[1:08:21] morning
[1:08:22] praise the lord amen
[1:08:25] oh i pray that the lord will just give
[1:08:28] us
[1:08:28] grace he will be able to help us what a
[1:08:32] brilliant idea
[1:08:35] they were so concerned about that their
[1:08:37] their their young people they were
[1:08:39] concerned about their children
[1:08:41] they don't want the other group on the
[1:08:42] other side saying
[1:08:44] well you people were across the river we
[1:08:46] don't even know you
[1:08:49] they were afraid of rejection
[1:08:52] they never wanted to be rejected
[1:08:57] so with all of these thoughts going in
[1:08:59] their mind we are yet across the river
[1:09:03] oh maybe we may not have the time to go
[1:09:06] down there
[1:09:07] for service all the while so let's just
[1:09:09] make our family alter
[1:09:13] we can make our family altar and play
[1:09:15] tapes
[1:09:18] praise the lord
[1:09:22] we can play the prophet tape make our
[1:09:24] family altar and just play the prophet
[1:09:26] tape
[1:09:31] but abraham says i mean telling 10
[1:09:33] minutes we can sit down
[1:09:35] you know uh have our quiet time for 10
[1:09:38] minutes
[1:09:39] and then we can do our song service
[1:09:41] let's just sing few songs
[1:09:43] and then you know we can press play
[1:09:50] praise the lord
[1:09:58] well we can go down there to the the
[1:10:00] tabernacle are shallow
[1:10:02] once in a while
[1:10:07] praise the lord but this is our memorial
[1:10:12] i mean we can use this to educate our
[1:10:15] children
[1:10:18] as much as that seems like
[1:10:21] an appealing idea
[1:10:26] their altar did not have blood on it
[1:10:31] praise the lord amen
[1:10:34] and do you know the reason why the
[1:10:37] choosing place
[1:10:38] where god has promised to meet his
[1:10:41] people
[1:10:42] the place that god puts his name
[1:10:46] there has to be blood
[1:10:50] amen when adam failed in the garden of
[1:10:53] eden
[1:10:54] god himself came down the bible says
[1:10:57] he wrapped them in a sheepskin where
[1:11:00] will he get it from unless
[1:11:02] he has killed a lamb
[1:11:07] praise the lord
[1:11:11] unless he has killed alam and that is
[1:11:14] the only way
[1:11:15] god will be able to approach
[1:11:19] man in their weakness and condemnation
[1:11:22] and whatever is going on with them
[1:11:24] he has to approach us by the way of the
[1:11:27] blood
[1:11:32] glory be to god
[1:11:35] excuses always come out of good ideas
[1:11:41] and shortcuts always come out of
[1:11:43] brilliant idea
[1:11:46] praise the lord but when we study this
[1:11:49] together you will see that it cost these
[1:11:51] people
[1:11:52] more than they ever thought it would
[1:11:56] have caused him
[1:11:58] praise the lord this brilliant idea
[1:12:02] they said no no no uh
[1:12:05] finney has that god forbid if that is
[1:12:09] ever our desire
[1:12:11] to separate to create a new church or a
[1:12:14] denomination
[1:12:15] may god slay us that is not our idea
[1:12:19] you know the devil will never come and
[1:12:21] give you any
[1:12:22] idea that his fist contrary to the word
[1:12:25] he will never do that he will give you a
[1:12:29] reason
[1:12:30] to carry out the word in a different way
[1:12:36] an appealing reason to carry out the
[1:12:40] world
[1:12:40] in a different way now you can see
[1:12:43] the contracts of this with jeroboam
[1:12:48] when jeroboam took over israel because
[1:12:51] rihabram was over in judah when joe
[1:12:54] abram took over the 10 tribes
[1:12:57] he cut them completely away he built an
[1:13:00] altar
[1:13:01] in in beltra he built one in down and he
[1:13:04] told the people
[1:13:05] he says look this is the god that has
[1:13:07] brought you
[1:13:08] out of israel you don't need to go to
[1:13:11] jerusalem
[1:13:14] now we can see that this this
[1:13:18] is a complete rebellion against the law
[1:13:22] and if you study the scripture and study
[1:13:25] a history
[1:13:26] the people left they went back
[1:13:31] to the tabernacle of david
[1:13:34] many of them now you see in history they
[1:13:37] were always said
[1:13:39] there was there was a lost 10 tribe of
[1:13:41] israel when you study
[1:13:43] you know people would talk about the
[1:13:44] lost 10 tribes there was never a lost 10
[1:13:46] tribe
[1:13:48] because you have to remember that these
[1:13:51] 10 tribes that were on the
[1:13:53] jeroboam they went into idolatry that
[1:13:56] was where ahab and all of these guys
[1:13:58] were birthed
[1:13:59] under this this rebellion that that
[1:14:01] turned into the worship of god and
[1:14:03] jessica came on the scene
[1:14:05] and all of that but there were people
[1:14:10] that were leaving their tribe to go and
[1:14:13] settle
[1:14:14] in the land of judah because they wanted
[1:14:18] to worship the god of
[1:14:19] israel
[1:14:23] praise the lord the ten tribes were
[1:14:26] conquered by the assyrians
[1:14:28] that gave us the birth toward the to the
[1:14:31] samaritans
[1:14:32] because when when the assyrians
[1:14:34] conquered them they dominated them and
[1:14:37] they corrupt them of their language
[1:14:41] praise the lord by the people
[1:14:44] whose heart was after the worship of the
[1:14:48] god of moses
[1:14:49] whose heart the people that wanted the
[1:14:52] sprinkling of blood
[1:14:53] they would leave the ten tribes they
[1:14:55] were run down to judah
[1:14:57] they settled down in judah because they
[1:14:59] were satisfied with the true watcher
[1:15:01] they knew
[1:15:02] that this was the sacrifice that god
[1:15:05] ordained for them to have
[1:15:10] praise the lord amen even though they
[1:15:13] were away from their land they were they
[1:15:15] were away from
[1:15:16] uh uh uh their settlement but what they
[1:15:20] wanted
[1:15:21] they wanted the god of israel they
[1:15:23] wanted the effect of the true worship
[1:15:28] but this one the altar of witness
[1:15:34] no we are not separating ourselves
[1:15:38] we are not building our own i mean we we
[1:15:40] are not starting our own church
[1:15:44] we are just building a family altar
[1:15:50] does that not sound reasonable every
[1:15:53] family should have a family altar
[1:15:56] praise the lord every home should have a
[1:15:59] family altar
[1:16:02] that's why the family comes together
[1:16:07] and we can put our needs and we can talk
[1:16:09] about the things
[1:16:10] that that concern us as a family we can
[1:16:13] bring
[1:16:14] our burden to the lord it's a brilliant
[1:16:16] idea every family should have a family
[1:16:18] altar
[1:16:20] beside the church every individual
[1:16:23] should have
[1:16:24] their own altar where they can meet god
[1:16:26] and cry out
[1:16:28] but what i'm saying this morning don't
[1:16:30] have an altar where there is no blood on
[1:16:35] praise the lord amen don't have an
[1:16:38] altar that is not sprinkled with blood
[1:16:44] because god will only hear your
[1:16:48] prayer through the blood
[1:16:52] he will hear your prayer by the voice
[1:16:55] of the blood
[1:16:59] praise the lord amen
[1:17:05] glory be to god glory be to god
[1:17:12] now see this this caught my attention
[1:17:16] that's what kind of drove me into this
[1:17:19] direction
[1:17:20] this morning and i want to study this
[1:17:24] together
[1:17:25] the way to have fellowship the way to
[1:17:30] have fellowship is through the blood
[1:17:32] amen we know that's the only way to have
[1:17:35] fellowship
[1:17:36] paul was trying to bring us moses
[1:17:39] tabernacle
[1:17:41] that when the sacrifice was made
[1:17:44] he pulled an house up right into the
[1:17:47] blood
[1:17:48] and then there there was a water that
[1:17:50] was missed with the arches
[1:17:52] of the heifer and uh and and
[1:17:55] he also dipped the half the the house up
[1:17:58] into it
[1:17:59] and then he sprinkle it on the people
[1:18:02] can you imagine all the people there for
[1:18:04] worship
[1:18:06] that is the blood of the sacrifice
[1:18:08] everybody want a touch of that blood
[1:18:10] because they want to be identified with
[1:18:11] the sacrifice amen
[1:18:13] praise the lord and that is that that is
[1:18:15] the way that we all must be desiring
[1:18:17] to have a touch of the word amen and say
[1:18:20] god speaks to me amen
[1:18:22] praise the lord i want the word to speak
[1:18:24] to me i want to have an effect of the
[1:18:26] word
[1:18:27] then you are identified with your
[1:18:28] sacrifice
[1:18:31] and then he did not want to stop there
[1:18:33] after he sprinkled the people
[1:18:36] first he takes the blood
[1:18:39] and then he sprinkled the bulk of the
[1:18:41] lord
[1:18:44] he would sprinkle the the the ark of the
[1:18:48] coveted
[1:18:49] because it was in the act of the coveted
[1:18:51] in the lord the tablets was laying
[1:18:54] and then he would turn around and he
[1:18:55] would sprinkle everything that is that
[1:18:57] is
[1:18:58] in the place of worship
[1:19:02] because everything must come under
[1:19:06] the blood i mean
[1:19:09] everything must come under the word the
[1:19:12] the the the worshippers the music that
[1:19:15] is played
[1:19:16] and everything it should be under the
[1:19:18] word
[1:19:20] that was what the the the sprinkling of
[1:19:23] the blood
[1:19:23] on the instrument meant we cannot play
[1:19:26] rock and roll music
[1:19:29] because we want to get the people hyper
[1:19:32] like get the people
[1:19:34] rejoicing so we we know everything must
[1:19:37] line up with the word of god
[1:19:40] it must all be sprinkled with blood
[1:19:43] everything in the tabernacle
[1:19:48] has to be under the blood
[1:19:51] praise the lord amen
[1:19:54] that's how much important it is
[1:19:58] even in the millennium we will be under
[1:20:01] the blood
[1:20:04] praise the lord amen
[1:20:07] even in the millennium we will be honor
[1:20:10] the blood sacrifice of our lord jesus
[1:20:13] christ
[1:20:15] glory be to god that how much the blood
[1:20:19] is important now let's let's read this
[1:20:22] together now
[1:20:24] the way to have fellowship let's study
[1:20:27] this together look
[1:20:28] when israel was divided was dividing
[1:20:32] up the land there was i believe
[1:20:35] it was god was one of them and perhaps
[1:20:39] they have tried they didn't go over
[1:20:43] into the promised land they stay
[1:20:47] on this side the borderline
[1:20:51] now you have to remember they were on
[1:20:54] the other side
[1:20:56] of jordan praise the lord
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:05] jesus visited that same people
[1:21:10] and look at the result
[1:21:14] of staying out of the full
[1:21:17] benefit of god's word
[1:21:23] look at the result of staying
[1:21:27] out of the full benefit
[1:21:31] when the scripture says don't forsake
[1:21:33] the assembling of the saints
[1:21:36] praise the lord amen when the scripture
[1:21:40] says
[1:21:41] repent be baptized in the name of the
[1:21:44] lord jesus you will receive the
[1:21:46] the gift of the holy ghost there is a
[1:21:49] benefit
[1:21:50] every promise every instruction that god
[1:21:54] has given us
[1:21:56] there is a benefit that's the reason why
[1:21:58] we cannot take a substitute
[1:22:01] we can we we cannot replace anything for
[1:22:05] the laws of god's word for the word of
[1:22:08] god that god has given to us
[1:22:12] and as much as itself as a good idea
[1:22:18] and finninhas and the rest of the
[1:22:19] children of israel agree with them
[1:22:21] oh okay we thought you all wanted to
[1:22:23] start your own denomination but you know
[1:22:25] it's a good idea
[1:22:26] for you to have this memorial in a way
[1:22:30] that you can remind your children
[1:22:33] let me tell you something they never
[1:22:36] needed one
[1:22:38] you know why they never needed one
[1:22:42] the data is red cross the jordan river
[1:22:47] amen when the cross
[1:22:50] the jordan river the water
[1:22:53] potted god gave them the same experience
[1:22:58] that moses and the children of israel
[1:23:02] had
[1:23:02] are the red sea praise the lord
[1:23:06] for all of those that were born in the
[1:23:07] wilderness that only
[1:23:09] year the testimony god opened the red
[1:23:12] sea god
[1:23:13] opened the red sea god gave them the
[1:23:16] same experience
[1:23:18] that the the priests went into the
[1:23:21] middle of the river
[1:23:23] and the water dried and the people
[1:23:25] crossed
[1:23:27] and what they decided to do they took 12
[1:23:29] stones
[1:23:31] and they brought it right into the
[1:23:33] middle of the river
[1:23:34] and they build those stones there as a
[1:23:37] memorial
[1:23:39] joshua told them so you can show your
[1:23:41] children tomorrow
[1:23:43] when they ask you what is the meaning of
[1:23:45] those stones you can tell them
[1:23:47] that that those stones were placed there
[1:23:49] by your fathers
[1:23:51] that was the time we walked through that
[1:23:53] land
[1:23:54] i mean through that river that water was
[1:23:56] dry up
[1:23:57] they had a time tested memorial
[1:24:01] they never needed to build one for
[1:24:03] themself
[1:24:06] praise the lord because the stone
[1:24:10] was right in the middle of jordan
[1:24:12] whether you are on this side
[1:24:14] whether you are on that side you can
[1:24:16] still look to the
[1:24:17] to the stones and point and says my
[1:24:20] father planted a stone down there
[1:24:23] amen you have the benefit of the revival
[1:24:27] because you have a time tested memorial
[1:24:31] are we together praise the lord
[1:24:35] but they just thought maybe we can go to
[1:24:38] an extra mile
[1:24:40] maybe we can do something more by
[1:24:43] building
[1:24:45] our family altar
[1:24:48] just according to the party just like
[1:24:51] how the
[1:24:52] the the altar is in shallow let's let's
[1:24:55] get them the
[1:24:56] exact measurement because we don't want
[1:24:58] to be wrong
[1:25:00] let's get the exact measurement let's do
[1:25:02] everything let's paint it the same way
[1:25:05] let's let's let's put curtains around it
[1:25:07] the same way
[1:25:08] it has to be just like the tabernacle in
[1:25:11] charlotte that was not god's instruction
[1:25:14] god never gave them that instruction it
[1:25:16] was just their own
[1:25:17] ideas and how many times
[1:25:22] i've seen family use their own idea
[1:25:26] and pull their entire family into errors
[1:25:32] praise the lord because we have a better
[1:25:35] idea of the message
[1:25:36] we listen to the message we read the
[1:25:38] prophet message
[1:25:42] if that's what that church decide to do
[1:25:44] it's up to them
[1:25:46] i mean we just go in there because it's
[1:25:47] our church but we have our own altar we
[1:25:50] will do it our
[1:25:51] own way
[1:25:56] praise the lord we will do it our
[1:25:59] own way why because
[1:26:03] we have the message we know what the
[1:26:05] prophet said about church order
[1:26:09] glory be to god amen
[1:26:15] praise the lord amen
[1:26:23] but branham said look at the result
[1:26:28] of staying out of the full
[1:26:31] benefit of god's love
[1:26:37] praise the lord look at the result
[1:26:43] that they brought upon themselves
[1:26:46] let's read a little bit
[1:26:50] and many other things we can bring from
[1:26:51] out of the word of god
[1:26:53] but i really this really struck me this
[1:26:56] this morning when i
[1:26:57] when i realized that brother branham
[1:26:59] said this
[1:27:00] i i spoke on the man of gabra
[1:27:05] some time ago and i was talking
[1:27:11] on the birthstone
[1:27:14] when godmother was going to give
[1:27:17] birth and the way she in the way she
[1:27:20] cried out
[1:27:21] in pains and talked about
[1:27:24] how how she suffer
[1:27:28] but finally you will overcome
[1:27:35] that was her cried on her birth under
[1:27:37] the birth pains
[1:27:39] you suffer but finally
[1:27:43] you overcome be to god
[1:27:47] and we realized that that thing followed
[1:27:49] that tribe
[1:27:50] of god
[1:27:54] but let's go on a little bit here you
[1:27:55] see what we will find out here
[1:27:58] when jesus visited them
[1:28:02] he went over to gatherera
[1:28:07] and that place of gatherer was
[1:28:11] the inhabitants of the children of god
[1:28:18] praise the lord and we know what
[1:28:20] gatherer is
[1:28:22] gatherer is a place that our great lake
[1:28:26] demon possess
[1:28:29] we find a man there fell with a bunch of
[1:28:32] demons
[1:28:32] out of counts until the demons could
[1:28:35] speak
[1:28:36] out of him we are legions for we are
[1:28:40] many
[1:28:42] it was a land full
[1:28:45] of demon possession
[1:28:51] the result of keeping ourselves out of
[1:28:54] the full benefit
[1:28:57] you can make your own religion in your
[1:28:59] mind
[1:29:00] you can make your own worship
[1:29:05] because that's one thing this this this
[1:29:07] age is full of is self-worship
[1:29:10] paul cried against that thing in to the
[1:29:12] church of kalusha because
[1:29:14] he saw the spirit among the people they
[1:29:16] were so proud
[1:29:18] until they worshiped himself
[1:29:23] an age of self-worship self-exaltation
[1:29:30] people talk about themselves too much
[1:29:32] more than they even talk about the lord
[1:29:38] the lord are we together
[1:29:42] see the result word
[1:29:46] they led their generation to just
[1:29:50] cooking out for themselves a good idea
[1:29:57] and they even told finney house and says
[1:30:00] this altar is not for burnt offering if
[1:30:03] you don't have an author for brand
[1:30:05] offering then why do you have an
[1:30:06] altar
[1:30:09] amen if you don't have an altar for
[1:30:12] burnt offering
[1:30:14] when we were setting on sacrifice
[1:30:16] there's one of
[1:30:17] the sacrifices that bring a sweet smell
[1:30:20] to god
[1:30:22] that is the sacrifice where the entire
[1:30:25] body of the beast
[1:30:27] is burned the only thing that is taken
[1:30:30] from that sacrifice is the flesh
[1:30:32] because god don't have no desire in
[1:30:35] flesh
[1:30:36] flesh stinks in god's nose so the only
[1:30:39] thing that is taking away
[1:30:41] from that sacrifice is the flesh but the
[1:30:43] entire
[1:30:45] body of the beast is burnt to god
[1:30:49] and it brings a sweet smell and then if
[1:30:52] you
[1:30:53] have an altar that you are not ready to
[1:30:56] give all to god
[1:30:57] you better break it down because god is
[1:31:00] not going to take half
[1:31:02] in american offering he's not going to
[1:31:04] take half
[1:31:08] they say this altar is not for burnt
[1:31:11] offering
[1:31:14] it's not for sacrifice why would you
[1:31:17] have an altar
[1:31:18] and you are not willing to sacrifice
[1:31:27] look at the result
[1:31:31] in another sense we can say they grieve
[1:31:33] the holy ghost
[1:31:34] and when you grieve the holy ghost you
[1:31:36] turn yourself loose for demon powers
[1:31:38] you can get born shall release your
[1:31:40] spirit on you
[1:31:42] because they were stayed there they were
[1:31:45] staying they were still worshiping they
[1:31:47] were still being called children of the
[1:31:48] of of israel they would still be leaving
[1:31:53] but slowly slowly
[1:31:57] the entire family was drifting off
[1:32:02] they were drifting off the original
[1:32:04] pattern
[1:32:05] they were drifting off of the experience
[1:32:10] when the people would go down to shallow
[1:32:13] where the sacrifice was where the burnt
[1:32:16] offering
[1:32:18] was lifted to god and the people would
[1:32:21] get an experience the shaking of glory
[1:32:23] will come down and consume their
[1:32:25] sacrifice
[1:32:27] they will come oh my goodness thank god
[1:32:29] the service well i was not feeling well
[1:32:31] this morning but when i went
[1:32:33] i mean after the the sprinkling of the
[1:32:35] blood
[1:32:36] i just felt good and these people they
[1:32:40] just had an
[1:32:41] altar exact measurement exact pattern
[1:32:45] exact appearance having the form of
[1:32:48] godliness
[1:32:52] praise the lord is that not where we
[1:32:55] are praise the lord
[1:32:59] is that not where we are having a form
[1:33:01] of godliness
[1:33:03] just because we can say we are in a
[1:33:05] message we identified with
[1:33:07] with the prophet of the hour when god
[1:33:11] has has promised prophesied that the
[1:33:14] world will be
[1:33:15] manifest the word that our last day
[1:33:18] prophet spoke will once again be
[1:33:21] manifested among the people
[1:33:23] he said the things that you saw
[1:33:24] temporarily in my ministry
[1:33:26] he said watch and see praise the lord
[1:33:31] the things that you saw temporary he
[1:33:33] said wash and see
[1:33:36] and we will never have those results if
[1:33:39] we take blood from on the altar
[1:33:42] we will never have those results if we
[1:33:45] don't have a burn offering
[1:33:47] if we are not ready to give all that's
[1:33:49] what preeminence
[1:33:50] is that's what preeminence is
[1:33:55] a bride a people that is ready to give
[1:34:02] all
[1:34:04] people argue about selling stuff
[1:34:07] yeah i mean the prophet said but this is
[1:34:09] the way i think about it
[1:34:12] you know this is the way i think it
[1:34:13] should be done
[1:34:19] slowly you find people
[1:34:22] destroy the entire
[1:34:26] family
[1:34:30] by separating himself
[1:34:33] having their own form of an altar that
[1:34:36] they have built an imaginary altar in
[1:34:38] their mind
[1:34:41] praise the lord i mean we can talk about
[1:34:44] speaking
[1:34:45] scar us into existence and we can all
[1:34:49] shout about it
[1:34:50] praise the lord that's the spoken word
[1:34:53] power
[1:34:54] but that spoken word power never went to
[1:34:56] the grave with brother branham
[1:34:57] it's supposed to be something that is
[1:34:59] among us where we can be able to speak
[1:35:01] speak speak against
[1:35:04] our temper against lust against things
[1:35:08] that are contrary to god's word speak
[1:35:10] the truth
[1:35:20] they had an altar without blood they had
[1:35:23] an altar
[1:35:24] and all they were just talking about
[1:35:27] when moses built the altar
[1:35:29] children when moses built this altar
[1:35:32] we were there in the wilderness
[1:35:35] when he built the altar we saw the
[1:35:37] shakka glory
[1:35:40] talking about the experience of moses
[1:35:44] can never give you the result of moses
[1:35:48] it can never give you the result because
[1:35:50] you are not applying the word
[1:35:52] you are not following the instruction
[1:36:02] look at the result
[1:36:06] of staying out of full benefit
[1:36:11] god want to give us the holy ghost more
[1:36:14] than we desire it
[1:36:17] amen he want to deal with our life
[1:36:20] more than we want god to work through us
[1:36:32] the result of staying out of full
[1:36:36] benefit
[1:36:39] praise the lord
[1:36:42] are we together jesus visited them
[1:36:46] he went down to gatherera that's where
[1:36:52] the word word that's word they made
[1:36:56] that's
[1:36:57] where they come from that's right
[1:37:00] and their attitude was
[1:37:03] still the same way
[1:37:07] their attitude will stay the same way
[1:37:12] what brother branham told us that make
[1:37:14] elisha
[1:37:16] to curse those children to the bed
[1:37:19] was because of what their parents told
[1:37:22] them
[1:37:23] about the prophet they sat in their
[1:37:26] house
[1:37:27] on their family altar these people
[1:37:29] calling calling on jehovah
[1:37:31] and they were laughing at god's prophet
[1:37:33] he's above-headed man
[1:37:38] praise the lord the children just talk
[1:37:41] exactly what their parents said
[1:37:44] and ran after that prophet in the street
[1:37:46] you bob had a man
[1:37:48] crazy man
[1:37:52] praise the lord but says the attitude
[1:37:55] never change
[1:37:59] when jesus casted the spirit out of that
[1:38:01] man
[1:38:02] into their swamp whether they rose up
[1:38:04] against him
[1:38:06] you have come to the you have come to
[1:38:08] destroy our livelihood
[1:38:10] you mean you prefer peaks
[1:38:14] then your son that was possessed with
[1:38:16] demon
[1:38:20] praise the lord you mean you prefer
[1:38:23] peaks things that you can make money out
[1:38:25] of
[1:38:28] then you have in a some year that is
[1:38:30] possessed
[1:38:32] he have left his family
[1:38:38] praise the lord all of these things that
[1:38:40] is happening in this age
[1:38:42] people raise a family four or five
[1:38:44] children and then they decide to walk
[1:38:46] away
[1:38:46] and all of that it's just it's just
[1:38:49] demon possession
[1:38:54] to destroy the life of the children
[1:38:58] they were still the same
[1:39:02] the result of not getting full benefit
[1:39:06] people you think about that
[1:39:08] the result of just having a halfway
[1:39:10] religion
[1:39:14] not getting the full benefit of the
[1:39:17] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:39:19] not going through with god
[1:39:23] praise the lord i mean when you go
[1:39:26] through with god
[1:39:28] he brings you to such a place your heart
[1:39:31] is so sweet and full of reverence
[1:39:35] that even if you have to go to a
[1:39:38] catholic church
[1:39:39] you will go there and you will respect
[1:39:40] what the people are doing
[1:39:42] even if you don't believe it you will
[1:39:45] not be arrogant
[1:39:47] and start condemning everything around
[1:39:48] the place
[1:39:51] if you have gone through with god
[1:39:55] your heart will be so sweet
[1:39:59] so humble
[1:40:02] that you can go anywhere
[1:40:06] anywhere and still be a christian
[1:40:09] and say be a son of god and still be a
[1:40:12] daughter of god
[1:40:14] the thing that will be back in your mind
[1:40:16] is not church or religion
[1:40:17] it will be christ how much i can be
[1:40:21] christ among these people
[1:40:29] we are struggling with spirit of
[1:40:32] condemnation
[1:40:33] you have not gone through with god yet
[1:40:36] praise the lord brother branham right
[1:40:39] there in ohio
[1:40:40] what the god did to him
[1:40:43] he went down there saw that all woman
[1:40:46] with the police fletching with the
[1:40:48] with the police and doing all that she
[1:40:50] was doing
[1:40:51] he said god just wept this whole thing
[1:40:54] off how long
[1:40:55] will you bear with the filthiness that
[1:40:58] is done
[1:41:01] god broke a vision to him and say your
[1:41:04] altar does not have blood on it william
[1:41:05] branham
[1:41:08] you need blood on your altar
[1:41:11] god broke a vision to him and he saw the
[1:41:14] blood
[1:41:15] as a bumper
[1:41:19] glory be to god what is the knee of
[1:41:22] having an
[1:41:22] altar and you don't have blood on it

[1:41:29] nice
[1:41:31] god love a bloody altar
[1:41:34] amen and blood the altar
[1:41:37] is one that is filled with confession
[1:41:39] and tears
[1:41:40] oh god i mess it up on me
[1:41:46] because every birth is a mess
[1:41:52] praise the lord god said well then
[1:41:56] brandon
[1:41:57] your altar does not have enough blood on
[1:41:59] it
[1:42:01] and god showed a vision every time he
[1:42:04] would do something
[1:42:06] there's a blood bumper that would stop
[1:42:08] the wrath of god
[1:42:11] when he came from out of that vision say
[1:42:13] oh my god have mercy on me
[1:42:16] praise the lord
[1:42:20] he has some blood on his altar he had to
[1:42:24] go and meet the woman
[1:42:27] he says can i talk to you a little bit
[1:42:30] the very
[1:42:31] woman he was condemning the very woman
[1:42:34] he wanted god to sweep to hell
[1:42:38] but when he took blood on his altar
[1:42:43] and went to talk to her she knelt down
[1:42:45] right there
[1:42:48] and died gambling with her sexy clothes
[1:42:51] on her
[1:42:52] filter that she was locking makeup
[1:42:54] she'll never right down there
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:43:08] glory be to god that's the god we serve
[1:43:13] and that's the prophet we believe amen
[1:43:17] praise the lord he was not he was not
[1:43:19] ashamed to tell us that he did not have
[1:43:21] enough blood on his altar
[1:43:32] what is the need of having an altar
[1:43:35] why there is no blood praise the lord
[1:43:40] all you can talk about is all the things
[1:43:42] that have passed
[1:43:46] i used to be this i used to be there i
[1:43:47] used to be that
[1:43:49] that's all they were doing they just
[1:43:50] have a furnish it just
[1:43:53] it's not for burnt offering feeling i
[1:43:55] don't get mad with us
[1:43:56] it's not for burnt offering it's not for
[1:43:57] sacrifice we just have a year
[1:44:02] this we did it the same party we did it
[1:44:05] the same
[1:44:06] measurement everything is just here
[1:44:09] for a witness god has already given them
[1:44:11] a witness
[1:44:13] we have many people that are building
[1:44:14] their own witnesses
[1:44:16] and not taking god's witness what is god
[1:44:18] witness acts chapter
[1:44:20] 2 when he says i will make you witnesses
[1:44:24] that is god's witness the baptism of the
[1:44:26] holy ghost is god's witness
[1:44:38] but brandon says the attitude was still
[1:44:41] the same way it caused them
[1:44:45] a bunch of hawks
[1:44:49] to have the meeting they asked jesus
[1:44:52] to leave their lane that simple
[1:44:57] attitude their fathers talked many years
[1:45:01] to build something that resembled the
[1:45:03] word
[1:45:05] and they never knew that they were
[1:45:06] separating themselves from the word
[1:45:10] the era said the word in flesh they are
[1:45:13] rejecting the word
[1:45:16] praise the lord all you can talk about
[1:45:19] brother branham live
[1:45:20] speaking things into existence and all
[1:45:22] of those things
[1:45:23] people will shout they will rejoice they
[1:45:25] will blow whistle they will kick their
[1:45:27] shoes in the air
[1:45:28] but bring that word to take flesh
[1:45:32] bring that word to their personal life
[1:45:34] this is all you are attacking me
[1:45:38] the words want to be made flesh in you
[1:45:47] he was our wave sheep god with him
[1:45:50] that god can be able to get a man born
[1:45:53] in sin
[1:45:55] born from unbelieving parents
[1:45:59] father was a drunker god is showing to
[1:46:02] us that
[1:46:02] the new birth has more power than your
[1:46:05] natural birth
[1:46:08] and no matter if you were born in
[1:46:10] prostitution born on the road don't even
[1:46:12] know your parents
[1:46:13] it does not matter to god
[1:46:18] it does not matter to god when god get
[1:46:21] his hand on your life
[1:46:23] he can rewrite your life
[1:46:27] [Applause]
[1:46:35] glory be to god
[1:46:41] they had the same attitude brother
[1:46:44] branham said it took hogs
[1:46:46] it took peaks to come to the revival
[1:46:51] pigs came to the revival when the people
[1:46:55] won
[1:47:06] praise the lord are we together yeah
[1:47:11] amen
[1:47:16] they didn't want nothing to do with it
[1:47:23] they had their own ways they had their
[1:47:26] own churches
[1:47:28] they didn't want nothing to do with
[1:47:30] jesus
[1:47:33] so they asked him to leave the lane
[1:47:39] it was from that time
[1:47:43] it was from that time that a
[1:47:46] seed was so to reject the word
[1:47:51] it was from that time they built an
[1:47:55] altar without burn offering
[1:47:59] they built an altar with no blasting on
[1:48:03] it
[1:48:06] a kind of a way of being savage in their
[1:48:09] mind we want our children
[1:48:17] we are guidance we must do the best that
[1:48:20] god has given in our power
[1:48:22] train of the child in a way that it will
[1:48:23] grow
[1:48:25] that it will not depart from it it's not
[1:48:27] your it's not
[1:48:28] your training that it don't depart from
[1:48:30] is the word that they don't depart from
[1:48:34] amen is the word that they don't depart
[1:48:36] from saul
[1:48:37] do us a whole lot to instill the word in
[1:48:40] them not our ideas or what we think the
[1:48:43] word says
[1:48:48] expose them to the word read your bible
[1:48:50] sound
[1:48:51] read your bible daughter let them fall
[1:48:53] in love with that word
[1:48:54] let god start dealing with your heart
[1:49:00] praise the lord let god start dealing
[1:49:03] with your young heart
[1:49:09] sorry rebecca i get to your question
[1:49:11] amen i jumped over there and i talked
[1:49:13] about that
[1:49:14] i brought the paper here with me how can
[1:49:15] i forget like this
[1:49:17] amen the young sister asked me some
[1:49:21] some very very nice question they got me
[1:49:22] thinking
[1:49:24] amen praise the lord
[1:49:28] amen it got me thinking nice question
[1:49:31] she asked me here we talked about
[1:49:32] genesis 1
[1:49:33] 7 yesterday you know talking about water
[1:49:38] above the farming you know understanding
[1:49:41] that the farming man was heavens and all
[1:49:43] of that
[1:49:44] you know what uh uh and and listen to
[1:49:47] this question
[1:49:48] listen to this question it's very
[1:49:50] beautiful listen to it in genesis 10
[1:49:52] 5 genesis chapter 10 in verse 5
[1:49:56] verse 20 verse 31 it talks about
[1:50:00] everyone after their own tongue
[1:50:04] amen but in genesis 11
[1:50:07] it says there was one language
[1:50:14] so what is the difference if everybody
[1:50:16] had one language
[1:50:18] then how can everyone have their own
[1:50:22] tongue
[1:50:24] i mean this case can make you thinking
[1:50:26] amen
[1:50:28] praise the lord they can make you
[1:50:30] thinking
[1:50:32] praise the lord they can get you to work
[1:50:36] i mean it's paying my wheels a little
[1:50:38] bit
[1:50:42] glory to god but that's how god
[1:50:45] these with your heart instead of us
[1:50:48] right in the billboard you know we
[1:50:50] believe this message this is the way you
[1:50:52] must do and this is the way you might do
[1:50:53] all you do when you just joined in a
[1:50:55] pretty altar
[1:50:56] there is no blood on that altar
[1:51:06] is no blasting on that altar let that
[1:51:09] word start dealing with their heart
[1:51:12] where they can start reading their bible
[1:51:14] and you see them sobbing in their room
[1:51:16] and crying oh god help me
[1:51:19] let this thing become real to me
[1:51:28] they were thinking about their children
[1:51:32] they had their children in their mind
[1:51:35] so they decided to build their own
[1:51:37] family altar
[1:51:39] but they kept blood from on the altar
[1:51:46] so the entire generation wayne
[1:51:49] not knowing the importance of the blood
[1:51:53] they're not knowing the importance of
[1:51:56] the smoke growing up to god
[1:52:01] all the know we have an altar
[1:52:04] we are in the message
[1:52:07] praise the lord we wear dresses
[1:52:11] in our church we wear dress
[1:52:18] in our church we wear dress
[1:52:25] we don't wear dresses we wear dress
[1:52:31] there is no blood on that altar here
[1:52:34] there is no blood on that altar here
[1:52:39] there is no blood on that altar and god
[1:52:42] is not going to take your family blood
[1:52:46] you don't have to put your family blood
[1:52:47] on the altar
[1:52:50] god will take one thing that's the
[1:52:52] bleeding word
[1:52:53] this word has to be bleeding that's the
[1:52:57] thing that gives life
[1:53:10] they had their children in mind
[1:53:17] or maybe if we do this if we get their
[1:53:20] attention maybe if we do
[1:53:21] they will be interested in the lord you
[1:53:24] pray for those kids
[1:53:25] get before god cry to god for them
[1:53:30] give them the word
[1:53:34] and let god go dealing with the heart
[1:53:39] having the form of godliness
[1:53:42] but denying the power thereof they can
[1:53:45] dress the message
[1:53:46] they can talk the message amen
[1:53:54] that blood on the altar and because they
[1:53:57] rejected the word
[1:53:59] they rejected the simple instruction
[1:54:02] they make an excuse a brilliant
[1:54:04] convincing excuse
[1:54:08] and even finny has to praise fell for it
[1:54:10] okay that's nice
[1:54:12] nice nice as long as you guys are not
[1:54:16] going to
[1:54:16] to to sacrifice i mean they needed a
[1:54:20] gideon that would break that altar down
[1:54:26] and say shallow we go
[1:54:29] they needed to gideon
[1:54:32] praise the lord father said
[1:54:37] boy you broke my my my my god there he
[1:54:40] said why are you talking for your god
[1:54:43] why why are you making an argument for
[1:54:45] your god god should be talking for you
[1:54:55] i mean sometimes you you study things
[1:54:57] and and it's just
[1:54:58] it just grabs you i mean this thing just
[1:55:01] frees me
[1:55:02] it frees me it frees me to know
[1:55:10] here is the god of israel still
[1:55:12] concerned for them
[1:55:14] he came in flesh and he's going down
[1:55:17] there
[1:55:18] thinking that it will bring a revival to
[1:55:20] the people
[1:55:23] jesus had this man in his mind
[1:55:27] he said we must go on the other side
[1:55:31] he had to go just for one soul
[1:55:34] because he was a seed of abraham
[1:55:39] he was from the tribe of god
[1:55:43] jesus was concerned about him but the
[1:55:45] people there
[1:55:46] they were so caught up in their own
[1:55:47] religion
[1:55:51] he had to go there all they could do for
[1:55:55] the man is just put him in chains
[1:55:57] chain his legs chain his hands because
[1:56:00] he's cutting himself
[1:56:03] and he's running after people that's all
[1:56:05] they can do and that's
[1:56:06] all this world religion can do just put
[1:56:11] us in chains
[1:56:14] and create division division and put
[1:56:17] hatred in the heart of the people
[1:56:19] they put the men in chains and they
[1:56:21] hated him
[1:56:25] that's all their religion could provide
[1:56:28] that's what happens
[1:56:29] when you have an altar without blood
[1:56:36] it's so pretty you don't want nobody to
[1:56:38] mess it up you don't want nobody to
[1:56:41] touch it
[1:56:42] so he said leave it late leave it like
[1:56:43] that no no no don't put your hands on it
[1:56:46] it's a pretty auto let it be there
[1:56:56] they had their own church they didn't
[1:56:58] want nothing
[1:57:00] to do with jesus so they asked him to
[1:57:03] leave their lane
[1:57:05] but he went anyhow because there was one
[1:57:08] soul
[1:57:09] calling him there was one soul
[1:57:14] calling him
[1:57:17] if we can just imagine that man in
[1:57:20] chains
[1:57:22] and way down in his subconscious
[1:57:25] he's thinking about the god of abraham
[1:57:28] the god that brought our fathers through
[1:57:30] the red sea
[1:57:32] way down in his subconscious
[1:57:36] i was thinking about a subconscious
[1:57:40] and i was thinking about
[1:57:44] on the message your dreams were
[1:57:47] imprisoned you
[1:57:52] praise the lord it was joseph dreams
[1:57:54] that put him in praising
[1:58:00] glory be to god i'm preaching this i'm
[1:58:01] not preaching that one yet amen
[1:58:03] so don't stop pulling me in there what
[1:58:06] are you talking i can feed it i can feel
[1:58:08] the current
[1:58:10] amen people want me to change now and go
[1:58:12] into that
[1:58:13] praise the lord amen
[1:58:17] glory be to god don't worry the same
[1:58:19] dream that i'm praising you your dream
[1:58:21] will set you free amen
[1:58:22] [Laughter]
[1:58:27] so just leave me now let me preach my
[1:58:28] message okay
[1:58:30] glory be to god oh my
[1:58:34] but way down in his subconscious
[1:58:38] he's thinking that's what that
[1:58:40] predestinated he does for you
[1:58:42] when you are so backslidded so confused
[1:58:46] so away from god you don't even know how
[1:58:49] to get back to your bible to make sense
[1:58:51] of reading it
[1:58:52] but down in your subconscious something
[1:58:55] tells you
[1:58:57] there is a god in heaven something tells
[1:59:00] you that this word is truth
[1:59:04] you don't know how to get back to it you
[1:59:06] hold your bible in your hands
[1:59:08] oh my god
[1:59:16] confused you are completely out of it
[1:59:33] praise the lord i was talking to a young
[1:59:35] man
[1:59:42] and
[1:59:44] uh i call him
[1:59:48] with my number he won't pick up so i i
[1:59:50] trick him
[1:59:54] i call him with another number and he
[1:59:55] pick
[1:59:57] when he realized i was the one he stuck
[2:00:01] i said what are you avoiding me why are
[2:00:04] you avoiding my call
[2:00:07] what's going on you know what's
[2:00:08] happening he says
[2:00:11] whoa yeah no you know when
[2:00:14] you talk a little bit this is well okay
[2:00:17] i mean you're feeling like just doing
[2:00:18] you
[2:00:19] are you enjoy doing you
[2:00:25] praise the lord but we had a good
[2:00:27] composition
[2:00:28] we were able to break the ice a little
[2:00:30] bit
[2:00:31] and then after he texted me back he says
[2:00:34] he said brother want thank you for
[2:00:35] calling me i really thought you were
[2:00:37] going to blast at me
[2:00:40] he says i really thought you were going
[2:00:42] to chew me up
[2:00:44] i said no but i'm not chewing you up
[2:00:48] i just uh just wanted to touch base with
[2:00:50] you amen
[2:00:51] and tell you that when you finish doing
[2:00:53] you god is waiting for you
[2:00:55] so you can do god amen
[2:00:58] [Applause]

[2:01:10] interesting amen

[2:01:25] this
[2:01:27] praise the lord you know when i'm going
[2:01:29] with this
[2:01:31] and i can see sometimes
[2:01:35] many many of our children
[2:01:38] are innocent sometimes
[2:01:42] sometimes we parents
[2:01:46] are the ones that build those altars
[2:01:50] and we drive them away
[2:01:53] because we build this image before them
[2:01:57] praise the lord
[2:02:00] i'll tell you one one of my experience
[2:02:02] that i had
[2:02:06] which of course it was
[2:02:09] i was just i was just just a child just
[2:02:11] a young
[2:02:12] child but and i didn't even know
[2:02:16] knew what it was but many of the times
[2:02:18] that's what happens
[2:02:20] and and this this family friend
[2:02:24] to my mama we used to run through
[2:02:27] neighbors who run through one another
[2:02:28] house so i came from the soccer fee and

[2:02:48] a
[2:02:48] dad on the ground and you know what i
[2:02:50] mean so when i got in

[2:03:42] to sleep
[2:03:44] and when i woke up everybody was going
[2:03:46] from the room

[2:04:01] an experience with god

[2:08:30] of god in my own skin
[2:08:36] i don't want to be sister this i want to
[2:08:39] be who i
[2:08:40] am
[2:08:43] i want to appreciate what you have given
[2:08:45] me
[2:08:47] appreciate what you are doing in my life
[2:08:56] glory be to god
[2:09:01] the bible says there stood as an
[2:09:05] altar of witness unto those people
[2:09:09] but it was a wrong witness it was a
[2:09:12] witness
[2:09:13] that we net bring convinced
[2:09:18] a witness that is just enough to make
[2:09:20] church members
[2:09:25] put the bible under the arm go and talk
[2:09:27] about the paradise and show
[2:09:29] people pictures in the paradise there
[2:09:32] will be no wall
[2:09:35] you see we'll be eating apple from the
[2:09:37] tree
[2:09:40] those kind of a witness don't make
[2:09:42] converts
[2:09:45] it was kind of a witness don't bring
[2:09:47] people to their knees
[2:09:49] but let me tell you the kind of a
[2:09:50] witness that does it when you go and
[2:09:52] tell somebody
[2:09:53] about how a sinner you were and i used
[2:09:56] to lie
[2:09:58] and i used to cheat but i met god
[2:10:03] that's the witness that speaks
[2:10:10] i was in out of this field
[2:10:14] i used to watch daddy movies
[2:10:17] but i mean god there with my heart and
[2:10:20] he changed me
[2:10:22] that is the kind of a witness because
[2:10:24] there is blood on that altar
[2:10:26] when blood is on your altar you are not
[2:10:29] afraid to confess your sins
[2:10:31] you are not afraid to testify of who you
[2:10:33] are
[2:10:35] when blood is on your altar
[2:10:40] not just a self made pretty altar
[2:10:44] you know everybody know you to be this
[2:10:47] nice guy
[2:10:51] oh yeah
[2:10:55] but when blood get on that altar
[2:10:59] then you are a witness
[2:11:05] musicians you can come
[2:11:10] we will continue praise the lord
[2:11:14] until we can fully sprinkle the blood
[2:11:18] amen until we can fully sprinkle the
[2:11:22] blood
[2:11:23] and spread it all over
[2:11:32] you see that's that's the reason why
[2:11:33] paul says
[2:11:36] he says in the book of hebrew
[2:11:42] he won against us separating ourselves
[2:11:46] he won against us
[2:11:50] creating separation among the brethren
[2:11:56] he won us the worshippers once parched
[2:11:59] that's why he said there is no
[2:12:02] remembrance of sin
[2:12:06] he want us not to forsake the assembling
[2:12:10] of the saints
[2:12:11] not to build not to build an altar for
[2:12:14] ourselves
[2:12:16] [Music]
[2:12:19] what are you reading the word what are
[2:12:21] you are praying
[2:12:23] you are not creating some
[2:12:27] self-imagination to yourself
[2:12:30] you are asking god to deal with me
[2:12:34] just as i am
[2:12:38] without no play
[2:13:00] just like what brother branham says
[2:13:02] choosing of a bride
[2:13:04] this is the kind of a decision that you
[2:13:05] made today
[2:13:08] you see the result five years down the
[2:13:14] road
[2:13:16] [Music]
[2:13:20] your personal altar your family altar
