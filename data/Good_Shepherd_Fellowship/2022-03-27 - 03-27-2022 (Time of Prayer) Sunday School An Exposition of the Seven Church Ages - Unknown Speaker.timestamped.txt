[0:00] [Music]
[0:49] so
[1:03] so
[1:10] [Music]
[1:33] do
[1:44] [Music]
[2:19] [Laughter]
[2:21] [Music]
[2:35] this ministry given them by our lord
[2:37] jesus
[2:38] and so when they died the ministry was
[2:40] over
[2:41] that is not so
[2:43] here in luke 10 1-9 we find that in the
[2:46] days of his earthly sojourn he had
[2:48] already started to give ministries of
[2:49] power to his own
[2:51] after these things the lord appointed
[2:53] other seventy also
[2:55] and sent them two and two before his
[2:57] face into every city and place whether
[2:59] he himself would come
[3:01] therefore said he unto them the harvest
[3:04] truly is great but the laborers are few
[3:07] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[3:09] harvest that he would send forth
[3:11] laborers into his harvest
[3:13] go your ways
[3:14] behold i send you forth as lambs among
[3:17] wolves
[3:18] carry neither purse nor script nor shoes
[3:21] and salute no man by the way
[3:24] and into whatsoever house ye enter first
[3:26] say
[3:27] peace be to this house
[3:29] and if the son of peace be there your
[3:30] peace shall rest upon it
[3:32] if not it shall turn to you again
[3:35] and in the same house remain eating and
[3:37] drinking such things as they give for
[3:39] the laborer is worthy of his hire
[3:42] go not from house to house
[3:44] and into whatsoever city ye enter and
[3:46] they receive you
[3:47] eat such things as are set before you
[3:50] and heal the sick that are therein and
[3:52] say unto them the kingdom of god is come
[3:55] nigh unto you
[3:57] who would dare deny the mighty ministry
[3:59] of philip who would dare to deny the
[4:01] mighty ministries of irenaeus martin
[4:03] columba patrick and countless scores of
[4:06] others who have had god's anointing upon
[4:08] them
[4:09] yes
[4:10] the bible way is the real way of the
[4:12] open door and i want to add my testimony
[4:15] to that
[4:16] the reason i have to do that is because
[4:18] i can only speak with assurance
[4:20] concerning what god has done in my own
[4:22] life
[4:23] so if you'll excuse a personal note here
[4:25] i will tell you how i know for a surety
[4:27] that jesus is the same yesterday and
[4:30] today and forever
[4:31] and that the power of god is still
[4:33] available to those who will believe and
[4:35] receive
[4:37] during my missionary trip to south
[4:39] africa
[4:40] god so blessed that when i came to
[4:42] durban the only place that could begin
[4:44] to accommodate the people was the huge
[4:45] race track which is the second largest
[4:48] in the world
[4:49] the crowd was well over one hundred
[4:50] thousand
[4:52] in order to keep law and order they had
[4:54] to put up fences to separate the various
[4:56] tribes
[4:57] they posted hundreds of policemen to
[4:58] keep the throngs quieted down
[5:01] those hungry souls had come for many
[5:02] miles
[5:04] a queen from rhodesia had come with a
[5:05] train of 27 coaches loaded with african
[5:08] natives
[5:09] they struggled in across the fields and
[5:11] mountains bearing on their backs for
[5:12] many and many a mile some loved one that
[5:15] needed help
[5:16] the whole country was stirred by the
[5:17] mighty works that had been manifested by
[5:19] the holy spirit
[5:21] one afternoon as i began to minister one
[5:24] of thousands of the mohammedans came up
[5:26] on the platform
[5:27] as she stood before me a missionary to
[5:29] the muhammadans began to softly implore
[5:31] the lord
[5:33] o for that precious soul
[5:35] oh for that precious soul
[5:37] he had been over there for years and
[5:39] years and according to his own testimony
[5:41] he had seen only one come to
[5:43] receive jesus christ as savior
[5:46] they were originally the medo persians
[5:48] whose laws change not
[5:50] they are so hard to win
[5:53] it seems that once a always a
[5:55] is a law amongst them
[5:58] well as she stood before me i began to
[6:00] speak to her and to all those thousands
[6:02] through the interpreters
[6:04] i said is it not so that the
[6:07] missionaries have told you of a jesus
[6:08] who came to save you
[6:11] you should have seen the people look at
[6:12] each other when i said that
[6:14] then when they had answered that was
[6:16] correct i went on and said
[6:18] but did the missionaries read to you out
[6:20] of this book
[6:22] i held my bible aloft for them to see
[6:25] that this same jesus was a mighty healer
[6:27] and that he would live in his people
[6:29] down through the ages until he came
[6:31] again to receive them unto himself did
[6:34] they tell you that because of that same
[6:35] spirit in them that was in jesus that
[6:38] they would be able to do mighty works
[6:39] even as jesus did
[6:41] did they tell you that you can be healed
[6:43] even as you can be saved
[6:46] how many of you would like to see this
[6:47] same jesus come down amongst us and do
[6:50] the same things that he did when he was
[6:51] here on earth long ago
[6:54] they all wanted that
[6:56] that is one thing they surely agreed on
[6:59] i then went on
[7:01] if jesus by his spirit will do what he
[7:03] did when upon earth will you believe his
[7:06] word then
[7:06] [Music]
[7:07] and here was that muhammadan woman in
[7:09] front of me
[7:10] the spirit began to move through me
[7:13] i said to her
[7:15] now you know that i don't know you i
[7:17] can't even speak your language
[7:19] she admitted that
[7:21] i said
[7:22] as for healing you you know i cannot
[7:25] but you heard the message this afternoon
[7:27] and understood me
[7:29] her indian interpreter answered back for
[7:31] her that she understood for she had read
[7:32] the new testament
[7:34] now the muhammadans are descendants of
[7:36] abraham
[7:37] they believe in one god
[7:40] but they reject jesus as the son of god
[7:42] and instead they take muhammad as his
[7:44] prophet
[7:45] they say that jesus never died and rose
[7:47] again
[7:48] they are taught that by their priests
[7:50] and they believe it
[7:51] i said
[7:53] but jesus did die and rise again
[7:55] he sent his spirit back upon the church
[7:58] that spirit that was in him is the very
[8:00] same spirit in the church now and it can
[8:03] and will produce what jesus produced
[8:05] he said in john 5 19
[8:08] the son can do nothing of himself
[8:11] but what he seeth the father do
[8:13] for what things soever he doeth these
[8:16] also doeth the son likewise
[8:18] now then if jesus will come and reveal
[8:20] to me what your trouble is or what you
[8:22] are here for
[8:24] if he can tell me what your past is
[8:26] surely you can believe for the future
[8:29] she said through her interpreter
[8:31] yes i can
[8:33] i said
[8:34] all right may he do it
[8:37] those muhammadans were watching intently
[8:39] they were all leaning forward to see
[8:41] what would happen
[8:42] then the holy spirit spoke
[8:45] your husband is a short heavyset man
[8:47] with a black mustache
[8:49] you have two children
[8:51] you were at the doctor's about three
[8:52] days ago and he gave you an examination
[8:55] you have a cyst on the womb
[8:58] she bowed her head and said
[9:00] that is true
[9:01] i asked her
[9:03] how is it you came to me a christian
[9:06] why didn't you go to your muhammadan
[9:07] prophet
[9:08] she said
[9:09] i think you can help me
[9:12] i said
[9:13] i can't help you but if you receive
[9:14] jesus christ as your savior he who is
[9:17] here now and knows all about you he'll
[9:19] help you
[9:21] she said
[9:22] i accept jesus as my savior
[9:25] that did it
[9:26] she was healed and about ten thousand
[9:28] mohammedans came to christ that day
[9:30] because the gospel was preached in both
[9:32] word and power
[9:33] god never told a man to labor 30 years
[9:36] and harvest nothing
[9:38] he gave us the open door of word and
[9:40] power and that is what we are supposed
[9:42] to use
[9:43] that is what gave paul his great and
[9:45] effective ministry
[9:46] first corinthians 2 4
[9:49] and my speech and my preaching was not
[9:51] with enticing words of man's wisdom but
[9:54] in demonstration of the spirit and of
[9:56] power
[9:57] listen to me now
[9:59] it was while on this same trip that as i
[10:01] was boarding a plane at new salisbury
[10:03] rhodesia that i saw a party of four with
[10:05] american passports
[10:07] i went over to them and said
[10:09] hello there i see you have american
[10:11] passports are you traveling somewhere
[10:14] the young man answered me
[10:16] no we are all missionaries here how nice
[10:19] i replied
[10:20] are you on your own or do you work with
[10:22] some organization
[10:24] we are methodists we come from wilmore
[10:26] kentucky he said
[10:28] well that is almost in my backyard i
[10:31] replied
[10:32] you wouldn't be that brother branham
[10:34] that comes from up that way would you
[10:36] i said
[10:37] yes that's right
[10:39] that cured him he wouldn't say another
[10:41] thing
[10:42] and the way he and those three girls
[10:44] just looked back and forth at each other
[10:46] so i said
[10:48] just a minute son i'd like to speak to
[10:49] all of you about some principles seeing
[10:52] we are all christians and here for a
[10:53] great purpose
[10:55] now you say you have all four been here
[10:57] two years
[10:59] can you say in the name of jesus that
[11:00] you can put your finger on one soul that
[11:02] you know you have won to the lord
[11:05] they could not do it
[11:07] i don't want to hurt your feelings girls
[11:09] i said
[11:10] but you all ought to be home helping
[11:12] your mothers with the dishes you haven't
[11:14] any business out on the field unless you
[11:16] are filled with the holy ghost and
[11:18] preaching the true gospel in the
[11:19] demonstration of the power of the holy
[11:21] ghost
[11:22] if you are not seeing the results that
[11:24] jesus said you would see it's because
[11:26] you are not preaching the true gospel
[11:29] let me go a step further and show you
[11:31] just how things can be on the mission
[11:33] field
[11:34] i don't say it is all this way but i am
[11:36] afraid too much of it is
[11:38] it was while i was on this same trip and
[11:40] touring around durban with the mayor
[11:42] that i saw a native with a tag around
[11:44] his neck and he was packing an idol
[11:47] i asked my friend what that tag was for
[11:50] and he said that when a native embraced
[11:51] christianity they put a tag on him
[11:54] that sure surprised me for here was a
[11:56] man calling himself a christian and
[11:58] carrying that idol so i asked how that
[12:00] could be
[12:02] he said
[12:03] i can speak his language
[12:05] let us go over and talk to him
[12:08] so we went over and the mayor acted as
[12:09] my interpreter
[12:11] i asked the native if he was a christian
[12:13] he affirmed that he surely was a
[12:14] christian
[12:16] i then asked why he carried the idol if
[12:18] he was a christian
[12:20] he answered that it was an idol his
[12:21] father had carried and he left it to him
[12:24] when i told him that no christian ought
[12:26] to carry idols he replied that this idol
[12:28] had been of great use to his father
[12:30] i was curious to know how
[12:32] and he said that one day his father was
[12:34] being stalked by a lion so he built a
[12:37] fire and spoke to the idol the way he
[12:38] had been taught by the witch doctor
[12:40] the lion left
[12:42] i informed him that it was the fire that
[12:44] sent the lion off as fire scares all
[12:46] wild animals
[12:48] i will never forget his reply
[12:50] he said
[12:52] well it is this way if a moya the spirit
[12:55] fails then this idol won't
[12:58] a detailed account of the african
[13:00] campaign may be found in the book a
[13:02] prophet visits africa
[13:04] that is just about all the strength the
[13:06] christian multitudes have because the
[13:08] word was not brought to them by the
[13:10] original open door of pentecost
[13:13] now getting back to the open mission
[13:14] door of the philadelphian age
[13:17] it did not have the open door of power
[13:18] it ought to have had
[13:20] notice in the same verse he mentions
[13:22] this open door he says
[13:24] thou hast little strength
[13:26] that is right
[13:28] the power of the spirit was missing in
[13:29] that age the word was well preached it
[13:32] was well able to make souls wise unto
[13:35] salvation
[13:36] but the great power of god that showed
[13:38] forth his mighty works that made bear
[13:40] his arm in behalf of his own was missing
[13:43] except amongst the scattered groups
[13:46] yet praise god it was growing and had
[13:48] increased over what they had in the
[13:49] reformation
[13:52] it was in this age that the man we often
[13:54] call the father of missions went out
[13:56] william carey a village shoemaker who
[13:59] pastored the particular baptist church
[14:01] at molten england mightily aroused the
[14:03] people by preaching on
[14:05] whether the command given to the
[14:07] apostles to teach all nations was not
[14:09] obligatory on all succeeding ministers
[14:11] to the end of the world
[14:12] seeing that the accompanying promise was
[14:14] of equal extent
[14:16] he was fought by the calvinists who had
[14:18] gone to the extreme of the doctrine of
[14:20] election believing that all who will be
[14:22] saved will be saved and missionary work
[14:25] would be against the work of the spirit
[14:28] but andrew fuller helped mr kerry by his
[14:30] preaching and fundraising
[14:32] such was their effect that a society was
[14:34] formed to spread the gospel to all
[14:36] nations in 1792
[14:39] this society sent out kerry who was
[14:41] signally blessed of god in winning souls
[14:43] in india
[14:44] in 1795
[14:46] an aroused christianity formed the
[14:48] london missionary society which we well
[14:50] know raised millions of pounds and sent
[14:53] thousands of missionaries over the years
[14:54] to accomplish the desires of the lord
[14:57] the spirit of god was moving and other
[15:00] sheep might well have been the cry of
[15:01] the heart of those earnest believers
[15:04] i have set before thee an open door
[15:08] i want to look at these words again
[15:10] this time though i am not going to
[15:12] disassociate them from missions i am
[15:14] going to bring you a thought which
[15:16] carries deep into the last age
[15:18] as i have already stated this age melts
[15:20] into the last stage
[15:22] it was in this age jesus said
[15:24] i come quickly
[15:26] verse 11
[15:27] and of the last age he was going to
[15:30] finish the work and cut it short in
[15:31] righteousness
[15:33] because a short work will the lord make
[15:35] upon the earth
[15:36] romans 9 28
[15:39] notice how this verse of revelation 3 8
[15:41] goes
[15:42] open door
[15:44] little strength word name
[15:47] that open door has to do with all three
[15:50] now what does the door signify
[15:52] in john 10 7 it says
[15:55] then said jesus unto them again verily
[15:58] verily i say unto you
[16:00] i am the door of the sheep
[16:02] that is right
[16:04] i am is the door of the sheep
[16:07] now this is not just a quaint expression
[16:09] this is actually so
[16:11] notice in john 10 when jesus is giving
[16:13] this parable he calls himself the
[16:15] shepherd
[16:16] then he calls himself the door
[16:19] and that is what the shepherd is to the
[16:21] sheep he is actually their door
[16:25] when i was over in the east i saw that
[16:27] at night time the shepherd would gather
[16:28] all his sheep together
[16:30] he would put them into the fold
[16:32] then he would count them
[16:34] when he was sure that they were all in
[16:35] he would lie down in the open door of
[16:37] the fold and literally become the door
[16:39] to the fold
[16:40] no one could get in or out except by him
[16:44] he was the door
[16:45] the next day as i went riding with a
[16:47] friend in a jeep i noticed that a
[16:49] shepherd began to lead his flock into
[16:51] the city
[16:52] right away all traffic came to a stop so
[16:55] that the sheep could go through
[16:57] now the cities over in the east aren't
[16:59] like they are here
[17:00] we keep all our merchandise inside
[17:03] but there it is like a big farmer's
[17:05] market with all the produce on the
[17:06] pavement for passersby to see and buy
[17:09] i thought
[17:10] oh my here is where the riot begins
[17:13] wait till those sheep see all that food
[17:15] out there
[17:16] but as the shepherd went ahead
[17:18] those sheep just followed right along
[17:20] exactly in each step
[17:22] they would look at all those goodies but
[17:24] not a sheep touched a thing
[17:26] oh if i could only have known their
[17:28] language i would have stopped traffic
[17:29] myself and preached them a sermon on
[17:31] what i had just seen
[17:34] when you are sheep that belong to the
[17:35] great shepherd
[17:37] you follow right along in each of his
[17:39] steps just as those sheep did
[17:41] you won't be tempted to turn aside for
[17:43] some big flower of a church or listen to
[17:45] the voice of some dd or phd or lld
[17:49] but you will stay with the shepherd
[17:52] the bible says that the sheep know his
[17:54] voice and they follow him but a
[17:56] stranger's voice will only cause them to
[17:58] flee and run after their true shepherd
[18:00] praise god
[18:03] but that was not all i saw and learned
[18:05] over there
[18:06] one day i got to thinking about having
[18:08] seen men out in the fields hurting
[18:09] different kinds of animals
[18:11] one fellow would be tending some pigs
[18:14] another some goats another some camels
[18:16] another some mules etc
[18:18] so i asked a friend who lived there what
[18:20] they called those men
[18:22] oh he replied they are shepherds
[18:25] i couldn't take that
[18:27] i said
[18:28] you don't mean to say they are all
[18:30] shepherds shepherds only heard sheep
[18:32] don't they
[18:34] no he said a shepherd is a herder or
[18:36] grazer so anyone who grazes animals is a
[18:39] shepherd
[18:40] well that did surprise me
[18:42] but i noticed a difference between those
[18:44] herders and the ones that took care of
[18:46] the sheep
[18:47] come nighttime all the others but the
[18:49] shepherd of the sheep left his animals
[18:51] in the fields and went on home
[18:53] the shepherd took his sheep with him and
[18:55] put them into the fold and then lay down
[18:57] and became the door of the sheep
[19:00] oh praise god our shepherd never leaves
[19:02] us or forsakes us
[19:04] when night time comes i want to be in
[19:06] his fold i want to be in his care
[19:10] now then we can see that jesus is the
[19:12] door
[19:13] he is the door of the sheep
[19:15] and notice that it speaks now of the
[19:17] door opening
[19:19] what is that but a revelation of him
[19:22] and that revelation is opening up to
[19:23] bring us strength to illuminate the word
[19:26] and glorify his name
[19:28] it was in the midst of the two last
[19:29] stages that the revelation of the deity
[19:31] of jesus christ blossomed out before us
[19:34] yes we knew he was god how else could he
[19:37] be our savior
[19:39] but to know that he was only god or god
[19:41] alone
[19:42] that he was the alpha and the omega that
[19:45] this jesus was both lord and christ
[19:48] making him lord jesus christ the father
[19:51] the son and holy ghost all one person
[19:55] that had been lost since the first
[19:56] church ages but now we are seeing it
[19:59] again
[20:00] the revelation of who he was had come
[20:02] back
[20:03] indeed godhead is not a three-person god
[20:06] with one personality for it takes
[20:08] personality to make a person
[20:10] if there is one personality there is but
[20:12] one person
[20:13] but they who believe in three persons
[20:15] have a three god godhead and are guilty
[20:17] of breaking the first commandment
[20:20] but the revelation of godhead is back
[20:23] now the true church can build in
[20:24] strength again
[20:26] after all this time she finally knows
[20:28] who her lord is
[20:30] once again we are baptizing in the name
[20:32] of the lord jesus just as they did at
[20:34] pentecost
[20:36] let me tell you of a god-given dream i
[20:38] had about triune baptism
[20:40] this was not a vision but a dream
[20:43] you know i am sure that one of the
[20:44] blessings of the church ages was to
[20:46] receive dreams by the holy ghost just
[20:49] the same as one can receive visions
[20:52] it was about 3am on a saturday morning i
[20:54] had just gotten up to get joseph a drink
[20:56] of water
[20:58] when i laid down i fell asleep instantly
[21:00] and dreamed this dream i saw a man that
[21:03] i supposed was my father
[21:05] he was a great big burly man
[21:07] i also saw a woman who was supposed to
[21:09] be my mother but she didn't look like
[21:11] her even as the man did not look like my
[21:13] father
[21:14] this man was very mean to his wife
[21:17] he had a large club with three corners
[21:19] on it
[21:20] you know when you take a log and set it
[21:22] up on end and hit it with an axe it
[21:24] makes a three-cornered wedge-like piece
[21:25] of firewood
[21:26] it was like that
[21:28] he would take this club and hit her with
[21:30] it and knock her down
[21:32] as she would lie there crying he would
[21:33] walk around with his chest stuck out and
[21:36] on his face was such a proud boastful
[21:38] look but he appeared to take great pride
[21:40] and satisfaction in beating up a poor
[21:42] little woman
[21:43] every time she tried to get up he would
[21:45] hit her
[21:46] i did not like what he was doing but as
[21:48] i considered stopping him i thought
[21:50] i can't tackle that man he is too big
[21:53] then he's supposed to be my father
[21:56] but down inside i knew he wasn't my
[21:58] father and i knew that no man had the
[22:00] right to treat a woman like that
[22:02] i went over and grabbed him by the
[22:04] collar and turned him around and said
[22:06] you have no right to strike her
[22:09] and when i said that my muscles grew and
[22:11] i looked like a giant
[22:13] the man saw them and then he was scared
[22:15] of me
[22:16] i said you strike her again and you'll
[22:18] deal with me
[22:20] he hesitated to strike her again and
[22:21] then the dream left me
[22:24] i awoke immediately after the dream
[22:26] i thought how strange that was
[22:29] i wondered why i had dreamed about that
[22:31] woman when suddenly there he came
[22:33] and the presence of god became known to
[22:35] me and the interpretation of the dream
[22:37] came from him
[22:39] now you people know that not only have i
[22:41] interpreted your dreams exactly
[22:44] but i have many many times told you what
[22:46] you dreamed so that you never had to
[22:48] tell me
[22:50] the woman represents the church of the
[22:52] world today
[22:53] i was born right into this mess the mess
[22:56] that she is in
[22:57] she was supposed to be a kind of mother
[23:00] she is the mother of harlots
[23:02] her husband is the denominations that
[23:04] rule her
[23:05] the three cornered block is false triune
[23:07] baptism onto a trinity
[23:09] every time she started to rise up that
[23:12] means the congregations began to accept
[23:14] truth he would drive her right down
[23:16] again with that false doctrine
[23:18] he was so big that i was afraid of him
[23:20] at first
[23:21] but when i came against him i found i
[23:22] had great and powerful muscles
[23:25] they were faith muscles
[23:27] the outcome of the dream was that
[23:29] since god is with me and can give me
[23:31] such strength
[23:32] then let me stand up for her against the
[23:34] denominational power of the world and
[23:36] make him quit striking her
[23:39] now i am not trying to build a doctrine
[23:41] upon a dream
[23:42] nor am i trying to vindicate any
[23:44] doctrine i stand for by a dream
[23:47] oneness of the godhead is all the way
[23:49] from genesis 1 1 to revelation 22 21
[23:53] but the people have been blinded by an
[23:55] unscriptural dogma of a trinity
[23:58] and that dogma is so universally
[24:00] accepted that to try to see a one god
[24:02] person
[24:03] is all but impossible
[24:05] if people can't see the truth of the
[24:07] godhead but fight it they can't ever see
[24:09] the rest of the truth because the
[24:11] revelation is jesus christ in his church
[24:14] and his works in the midst of the church
[24:16] for the seven ages
[24:18] did you get that
[24:20] now i am sure you understand
[24:22] thou hast a little strength and has kept
[24:24] my word and not denied my name
[24:28] now we have already mentioned how the
[24:29] strength was returning it was
[24:32] the power of the inquisition had waned
[24:35] people had left their homelands and
[24:36] demanded a freedom of worship
[24:38] the yoke of the hierarchy was being
[24:40] broken
[24:41] the governments were finding it wise not
[24:43] to champion one segment against another
[24:45] in fact
[24:46] well-meaning but poorly led people were
[24:48] willing to wage war to defend their
[24:50] religious rights
[24:51] perhaps the greatest show of strength of
[24:53] religion in this age was the fact that
[24:55] though france fell in revolution the
[24:58] great wesleyan revival kept the
[24:59] revolution away from great britain and
[25:01] saved her to be an instrument in the
[25:02] hand of god for many glorious years
[25:06] the preaching of the word was never
[25:07] greater
[25:08] as satan raised up his hordes of free
[25:11] thinkers as the originators of communism
[25:13] rose up as liberal theologians spread
[25:15] their filthy wares
[25:17] god raised up mighty warriors of faith
[25:20] and the greatest works of christian
[25:21] literature and teaching and preaching
[25:23] came from this era
[25:25] never has its preachers and teachers
[25:27] been matched and never will they be
[25:30] the spurgeons parkers mclarens the
[25:32] edwards bunions muellers brainerds barns
[25:35] bishops all came from this era
[25:38] they preached taught and wrote the word
[25:41] they glorified his name
[25:45] the judgment of the false jew
[25:48] revelation 3 9
[25:51] behold i will make them of the synagogue
[25:53] of satan which say they are jews and are
[25:55] not but do lie
[25:57] behold i will make them to come and
[25:59] worship before thy feet and to know that
[26:01] i have loved thee
[26:04] now we can note immediately that this
[26:06] problem of the false jew or false
[26:07] believers was already in existence in
[26:09] the second age
[26:11] these who falsely called themselves jews
[26:14] appeared right after the first
[26:15] outpouring of the first age and now they
[26:18] appear again in the second age after the
[26:20] reformation
[26:21] this is hardly an accident
[26:23] indeed it is not an accident
[26:25] it is a principle of satan
[26:28] that principle is to organize and claim
[26:30] originality and therefore be entitled to
[26:32] special rights and privileges
[26:34] let me show you
[26:36] back there in the smyrnan age these
[26:38] people lied and said they were actually
[26:40] jews or believers when they definitely
[26:43] were not
[26:44] they were of the synagogue of satan
[26:46] they were satan's organized crowd for it
[26:49] wasn't that age we saw the start of men
[26:51] in the ministry taking an unwarranted
[26:53] leadership over their ministering
[26:54] brethren bishops set up in districts
[26:56] over elders
[26:58] the next thing we saw was that in the
[27:00] third age there was definitely a place
[27:02] called satan's seat
[27:04] that age gave us church and state
[27:06] marriage
[27:07] with the power of the state behind her
[27:09] the church was literally physically
[27:11] invincible
[27:12] but god broke that hold in spite of the
[27:14] power of the state and the reformation
[27:16] brought great light
[27:17] but what happened
[27:19] the lutherans organized and joined with
[27:21] the state and again we see the synagogue
[27:23] of satan manifested in this sixth age
[27:26] now of course this synagogue group
[27:28] wouldn't say they are of satan no sir
[27:31] they say they are of god
[27:33] but they lie
[27:35] for he that is a true jew that is what
[27:37] they claim to be is one who is a jew
[27:40] inwardly in the spirit
[27:42] so then if they are false jews it means
[27:44] that they are as jude 19 says
[27:47] having not the spirit
[27:49] children of god are born of the spirit
[27:52] these have not the spirit and therefore
[27:54] they are not children of god no matter
[27:56] how fervently they protest and to what
[27:58] lengths they go to try to prove that
[28:00] they are
[28:01] they are dead
[28:03] they are children of organization and
[28:05] the true fruits are missing
[28:07] they are built upon their own creeds
[28:09] dogmas and doctrines and the truth is
[28:11] not in them for they have taken their
[28:13] own counsels above the word of god
[28:18] [Music]
