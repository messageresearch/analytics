[50:44] between AR Co and Ghana and uh uh he
[50:49] living the city that was an hour from
[50:52] where I was but we didn't get to know
[50:54] one another during that time I think
[50:56] think he might have traveled out of the
[50:58] country before I moved there and then uh
[51:02] but he was always coming down for some
[51:04] of our International Convention he was
[51:07] one of The Interpreter that's that's
[51:08] where I got to know him first and uh uh
[51:13] he did some little work in
[51:15] interpretation or translation let me see
[51:18] it that way uh uh with with message
[51:22] there and some message material he works
[51:25] uh with Brother s
[51:27] over there in New York and all of there
[51:31] so it's been a while that we've been
[51:33] wanting to have brother Paul come and
[51:35] visit with us and uh uh just to
[51:40] reconnect uh and U we just fa that you
[51:43] will come this time so he was supposed
[51:44] to be here last week was actually last
[51:47] week Sunday he was supposed to preach
[51:48] for us but then there was
[51:51] uh uh there was a funeral of a dear
[51:54] brother they went to be with Lord
[51:57] another good friend also uh uh and and
[52:01] the family wanted him to be be there so
[52:04] so he had to go for that feral so then
[52:06] we had to push push uh it to this
[52:09] weekend so spoke for us on Wednesday
[52:12] night he will come and bring the word
[52:13] tonight praise the Lord and uh uh we
[52:19] pray for him he have a flight right
[52:20] after preaching praise the Lord so um uh
[52:25] we P all we can
[52:27] and if he can travel today we'll send
[52:29] him back
[52:30] tomorrow so uh uh let's just stand on
[52:33] our feet and and then we will we will
[52:35] turn the service
[52:38] over and we have made some few comment
[52:41] from the the Sunday School tap that we
[52:43] played this morning but I will save it
[52:46] for next week and uh um just to be able
[52:51] to address some few things from the tape
[52:53] and also that concern us uh brother BR
[52:55] was talking about M's meeting we should
[52:58] have hours coming up here in August
[53:01] where we need to sit down as brothers of
[53:03] the church and talk about things that
[53:05] that concern us here as a local assembly
[53:08] and uh uh because we want to have
[53:12] uh our
[53:14] anticipation is uh the furtherance of
[53:17] the kingdom of God the continuation of
[53:20] uh the Church of the Living God praise
[53:22] the Lord the church do not die when
[53:24] men's die amen men die God raised up men
[53:28] to continue the work of God so we want
[53:31] to keep that in our mind praise the Lord
[53:34] many of us have walked with the Lord
[53:36] different experiences with the Lord but
[53:39] uh there is a generation of young people
[53:42] that we need to set a foundation for
[53:44] it's a generation of young people that
[53:47] we need to pray that God get a hold of
[53:49] them because we don't have a future and
[53:52] we don't have a Young Generation that
[53:55] have grabbed the vision and I think
[53:57] those are some of the things that
[53:58] brother Brandon was bringing over that
[54:00] message that's some of the things we
[54:01] want to talk about praise the Lord but
[54:04] until that time we just prepared ourself
[54:07] now and uh and ask that the Lord will
[54:10] just come and speak to us speak to us in
[54:12] his own way let our brother have the
[54:14] Liberty to bring the word and uh uh and
[54:19] we will be grateful we can say like
[54:20] those men on the road of himay did not
[54:22] our heartburn within us as the word was
[54:26] spoken to us this morning praise the

[59:29] you have come with Desires in your heart
[59:32] God will be gracious to you and Grant
[59:35] your heart
[59:37] desire and as your pastor was
[59:40] saying
[59:42] uh he had wanted to come here many times
[59:45] but I believe this is the right time and
[59:49] as he was
[59:51] saying
[59:53] um I used to live in every Co called
[59:58] and then later I move back to
[1:00:01] Ghana and uh I Used to Be The
[1:00:04] Interpreter in many
[1:00:06] conventions you to travel with many of
[1:00:09] the ministry Breen brother team ason
[1:00:13] which you know him very well and some
[1:00:15] other
[1:00:16] ministers before I came here in
[1:00:21] 2003 with my wife who passed away for
[1:00:25] years years ago it's about 4 years and
[1:00:30] uh a month I
[1:00:32] believe and here we are this morning
[1:00:35] among you to bring forth the word I
[1:00:38] don't call myself a preacher but I
[1:00:41] believe uh God will lead it this morning
[1:00:44] to say some things that will be a
[1:00:47] blessing to
[1:00:49] you and what I want to say is this we
[1:00:53] are living in a very treacherous time
[1:00:56] times where we find many
[1:01:00] people uh who want to go their own
[1:01:03] way but God did not create us to go our
[1:01:08] own
[1:01:10] way he Likens us to a
[1:01:15] sheep and as a sheep you need a
[1:01:20] shepherd and it's always good to be
[1:01:24] under the leadership
[1:01:26] of a
[1:01:28] Shepherd the prophet of God has repeated
[1:01:32] that so many
[1:01:34] times stay with your
[1:01:38] pastor and if there is anything that you
[1:01:40] don't
[1:01:42] understand go on your knees and pray if
[1:01:46] you still don't understand go to the
[1:01:50] shepherd God has so much equipped him to
[1:01:55] be able to help help you in this
[1:01:58] journey now in these
[1:02:01] days uh many want to go their own way
[1:02:05] but that is not God's
[1:02:08] way God's way is for his children to be
[1:02:12] led by
[1:02:14] himself and he places a pastor in a
[1:02:18] local church to be able to guide you and
[1:02:22] it's always good to have confidence your
[1:02:27] pastor if God has been gracious to him
[1:02:31] and he has led you thus far continue to
[1:02:34] have that
[1:02:36] confidence that God will continue to
[1:02:38] help him to lead you to his perfect
[1:02:43] destination is very important it's so
[1:02:47] simple that many people walk over it and
[1:02:51] when they do that they have problem
[1:02:54] along the way
[1:02:56] and if you do not want to have a problem
[1:02:59] stay with your pastor and the
[1:03:01] message I have where with um my pastor
[1:03:05] brother Simon bring gretings to from him
[1:03:08] to
[1:03:09] you
[1:03:11] um he has always said that and I've seen
[1:03:14] a lot as we work together people always
[1:03:19] want to go their own way they will leave
[1:03:23] churches and then by the time you
[1:03:25] realize
[1:03:26] they they are in deep problems but it
[1:03:30] pays to stay with your pastor is very
[1:03:35] important and let's turn us we read the
[1:03:38] word of God thank you
[1:03:40] musicians let's open to the Book of John
[1:03:46] chapter
[1:03:48] 3 John chapter
[1:03:51] 3 we will read from verse one to
[1:03:56] verse 13 John chapter
[1:04:03] 3 pray for your pastor pray for the his
[1:04:08] family don't say any evil thing about
[1:04:12] them God expects you always to speak
[1:04:15] good of your pastor and about one
[1:04:20] another is very very
[1:04:23] important so let's read verse John
[1:04:26] chapter 3 reading from verse 1 to verse
[1:04:31] 13 I hope you are
[1:04:36] there there was a man of the
[1:04:40] Pharisees named
[1:04:42] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[1:04:47] came to Jesus by
[1:04:49] night and said unto him
[1:04:53] Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[1:04:59] come from God for no man can do these
[1:05:05] Miracles that thou
[1:05:07] doest except God be with
[1:05:11] him Jesus answered and said unto
[1:05:15] him verily verily I say unto thee except
[1:05:22] a man be born again he cannot see the
[1:05:26] kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto
[1:05:31] him how can a man be
[1:05:35] born when he's
[1:05:38] old can he
[1:05:40] enter the second time into his mother's
[1:05:45] womb and be
[1:05:48] born Jesus
[1:05:50] answered verily verily I say unto thee
[1:05:56] except a man be born of
[1:06:00] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[1:06:05] the kingdom of
[1:06:08] God that which is born of flesh is
[1:06:14] flesh that which is born of the spirit
[1:06:19] is
[1:06:20] Spirit Marvel not that I said unto the
[1:06:25] the ye must be born
[1:06:29] again the wind bloweth with it
[1:06:33] listed and thou
[1:06:36] hearest the sound
[1:06:38] thereof but can not tell whence it
[1:06:44] cometh and whether it goeth so is
[1:06:49] everyone that is born of the
[1:06:53] spirits Nicodemus answered
[1:06:56] and said unto him how can these things
[1:07:02] be Jesus answered and said unto
[1:07:06] him are thou a
[1:07:10] master of
[1:07:12] Israel and knowest not these things
[1:07:16] verily verily I say unto thee we
[1:07:22] speak that we do know and
[1:07:27] testify that we have seen that which we
[1:07:31] have
[1:07:32] sinen and ye receive not our test our
[1:07:38] witness if I have told you Earthly
[1:07:43] things and ye believe not how shall you
[1:07:49] believe if I tell you of heavenly
[1:07:53] things and no man had ascended up to
[1:07:59] heaven by he that came down from heaven
[1:08:05] even the son of man which is in heaven
[1:08:11] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:08:14] reading of his word amen you may be
[1:08:18] seated
[1:08:26] I want to thank brother W for the
[1:08:28] invitation it's been a nice time being
[1:08:31] with you uh I was staying with brother
[1:08:35] Dan and the family they fed me very
[1:08:39] well and I believe next time I can I'll
[1:08:44] still be there and
[1:08:46] also uh brother one we were there on
[1:08:50] Saturday no Friday and we had some
[1:08:53] wonderful food over there cooked by the
[1:08:55] wife with a nice heart pepper I really
[1:08:59] appreciate that so God bless you all uh
[1:09:03] greetings to brother Andrew and the wife
[1:09:05] over there Sister Christine God richly
[1:09:08] bless you now this
[1:09:11] morning we want to take in the next 45
[1:09:15] 50 minutes and speak about walking with
[1:09:20] the
[1:09:22] supernatural walking with the
[1:09:25] [Music]
[1:09:27] Supernatural last Wednesday we were
[1:09:31] speaking on building a spiritual house
[1:09:34] for the Living
[1:09:36] God and we know that God is
[1:09:41] Supernatural God is a
[1:09:44] spirit and he created man in his own
[1:09:49] image in his own
[1:09:52] likeness and the man that he created was
[1:09:56] a spirit
[1:09:58] man and later on he formed a body from
[1:10:03] the dust and pull that Spirit man in the
[1:10:07] formed
[1:10:09] man but the formed man was just the
[1:10:14] mechanics and the spirit man was a
[1:10:18] Dynamics so the mechanics was being led
[1:10:23] by the Dynamics
[1:10:26] now that Spirit
[1:10:28] man uh the Bible says was in a
[1:10:32] resemblance of God in other words the
[1:10:38] spirit man that God
[1:10:40] created was a portrait of God if we you
[1:10:45] say
[1:10:46] so so we see that as long as the man in
[1:10:52] the Garden of Eden i b
[1:10:55] with the word of God everything went
[1:10:59] fine for
[1:11:00] him now when they listen to Satan's
[1:11:06] voice then came the
[1:11:08] trouble and that is why we see today on
[1:11:11] the streets I mean you see you hear of
[1:11:14] the ambulance you see a lot of things it
[1:11:18] because of the fall of
[1:11:21] men and the prophet of God in the
[1:11:24] message
[1:11:26] that he preached in
[1:11:28] 1962
[1:11:30] Wes he said as soon as the
[1:11:36] men Adam and Eve listen to the light of
[1:11:43] Satan the image of God left
[1:11:48] them the image of God was that Spirit
[1:11:53] man that was dwelling in
[1:11:56] them and the prophet says the very
[1:12:01] minute that they listen to Satan's
[1:12:05] lie the image of God took
[1:12:11] flight I want you to pay attention to
[1:12:15] that
[1:12:17] quote I I'm going to read it
[1:12:22] again the prophet of God
[1:12:26] says he
[1:12:28] says now when Adam and Eve listen to the
[1:12:34] LIE of the
[1:12:36] devil the holy image he calls it the
[1:12:39] holy
[1:12:41] image of God L them their Fellowship was
[1:12:47] broken with
[1:12:49] God their Fellowship of what
[1:12:53] Oneness with God was
[1:12:56] broken the very
[1:12:58] minute they listen to the LIE of the
[1:13:03] devil that brought their Fellowship that
[1:13:06] broke their
[1:13:08] fellowship and the very minute you
[1:13:11] listen to the LIE of the devil it to
[1:13:16] break your
[1:13:17] fellowship there is the very minute you
[1:13:21] go out from the presence of God
[1:13:25] wow when do you go out of the presence
[1:13:28] of
[1:13:30] God the very
[1:13:32] minute that you listen to Satan's
[1:13:36] lie that very minute you are out of the
[1:13:40] presence of
[1:13:42] God think about
[1:13:45] it and he continues to say
[1:13:50] this it
[1:13:52] says that is a very minute that you go
[1:13:55] out from the presence of God like he did
[1:14:00] is when you fail to take God's word just
[1:14:06] as it
[1:14:07] is God has given us his
[1:14:10] word in other words he has given us
[1:14:15] himself because the Bible say in the
[1:14:17] beginning was the
[1:14:19] word and the Word was with
[1:14:22] God and the word was God and the prophet
[1:14:27] somewhere said the word is still
[1:14:30] God so what we need to do is take the
[1:14:34] word of God and walk by
[1:14:38] it because that is the best thing God
[1:14:41] could ever give to human being is
[1:14:47] himself and the very moment you listen
[1:14:51] to any other things apart from the word
[1:14:53] of God apart from the voice of God you
[1:14:58] are out of the presence of
[1:15:01] God and when you are out of the presence
[1:15:04] of
[1:15:05] God you are at the mercy of the
[1:15:09] devil and that is why he behooves us to
[1:15:14] take God as at his
[1:15:17] word the best thing he could ever give
[1:15:20] to human being is himself is his word
[1:15:25] and the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve they
[1:15:29] were
[1:15:30] fortified behind this
[1:15:34] word in the same way
[1:15:37] today as long as we abide with the word
[1:15:41] and he abide in us we are
[1:15:44] fortified we are
[1:15:48] protected but when you come out of that
[1:15:50] word you leave that word and choose to
[1:15:54] walk by
[1:15:56] yourself you are by your
[1:16:00] own God is no more with you and that is
[1:16:04] what the prophet of God kept on saying
[1:16:08] stay with the
[1:16:10] word stay with the
[1:16:13] word and when you stay with the word you
[1:16:16] are fortified by
[1:16:21] it but when we leave the word of God
[1:16:26] then anything can happen to
[1:16:31] us now here was a
[1:16:34] man named
[1:16:37] Nicodemus that came to Jesus by night it
[1:16:41] doesn't matter when you come to
[1:16:45] him the important thing is that you come
[1:16:48] to
[1:16:50] him you see and when he came he has seen
[1:16:54] a lot of Miracles done by the Lord Jesus
[1:16:58] Christ and his other Pharisees they've
[1:17:01] seen the same
[1:17:03] thing and he said we
[1:17:06] know
[1:17:08] master that thou are from God that all
[1:17:12] these things that you do if God is not
[1:17:15] with you you cannot do
[1:17:19] them and Jesus start started talking to
[1:17:23] him
[1:17:25] and verse three he
[1:17:28] said Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:17:32] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[1:17:37] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:17:41] kingdom of
[1:17:43] God you see being born
[1:17:48] again and last we were talking
[1:17:51] about the new birth
[1:17:55] and the prophet of God says when you are
[1:17:58] born again then you have
[1:18:02] faith you do not have faith until you
[1:18:05] are born
[1:18:07] again and the prophet of God says said
[1:18:11] there that when you are born again then
[1:18:14] you have
[1:18:15] faith then you are in a position to
[1:18:22] grow think about it
[1:18:26] is very
[1:18:28] serious that uh
[1:18:32] today people don't want to be born
[1:18:38] again they are satisfied with what uh uh
[1:18:41] uh uh intellectual
[1:18:44] gospel they are satisfying with Social
[1:18:47] Gospel but God goes beyond that
[1:18:54] God wants to give you the Holy Spirit
[1:18:58] more than you desire to to have
[1:19:01] it and that is why we have to stay with
[1:19:04] the
[1:19:07] word you see then Nicodemus God Jesus
[1:19:13] was talking to him verse four Nicodemus
[1:19:16] said unto him how can a man be born when
[1:19:21] he's old can he enter the the second
[1:19:25] time into his mother's womb and be
[1:19:31] born see this thing that the Lord was
[1:19:34] telling him went beyond his his
[1:19:39] head because he was not born
[1:19:44] again and for him to understand what the
[1:19:46] Lord was telling him he needed to be
[1:19:49] born
[1:19:52] again he needed to be transformed
[1:19:56] he needed a
[1:20:00] regeneration but without the
[1:20:02] Regeneration you cannot understand the
[1:20:04] will of God you cannot understand the
[1:20:08] purpose of
[1:20:11] God let me go a little bit
[1:20:14] forward in Matthew
[1:20:17] 16 there Jesus called the
[1:20:21] disciples who do men say that I the son
[1:20:24] of man
[1:20:25] am you are this you are this you are
[1:20:28] that and then he turned to Peter you
[1:20:31] Peter what do you say I
[1:20:35] am you are the Christ the son of the
[1:20:39] Living
[1:20:42] God and Jesus turned to him and
[1:20:46] said thou are Peter by
[1:20:49] Jonas this thing that you say did not
[1:20:52] come by yourself
[1:20:55] it is my Father in Heaven that revealed
[1:20:59] this thing to
[1:21:01] you and Upon This Rock confession I'll
[1:21:06] build my
[1:21:07] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:21:10] Prevail against
[1:21:12] it and if you read further down to verse
[1:21:16] 21 when Jesus was telling
[1:21:19] them that he was going to go to
[1:21:23] Jerusalem and there he will
[1:21:25] be caught by the the Pharisees the
[1:21:29] elders and be
[1:21:31] crucified and on the third day he had to
[1:21:36] resurrect Peter called Jesus
[1:21:39] aside
[1:21:41] Lord you are not going to
[1:21:46] die Peter was rebuking God
[1:21:54] because in his mind he couldn't
[1:21:57] understand what the Lord was
[1:22:00] saying yet he has been with him for
[1:22:02] almost three and a half
[1:22:04] years he has seen the thing that he
[1:22:08] did even It Was Written in the
[1:22:13] prophecies he turned to the Lord Lord
[1:22:16] no and Jesus tells him what get behind
[1:22:20] me
[1:22:23] Satan why
[1:22:25] he could not comprehend it because he
[1:22:28] was not born
[1:22:33] again and if he had been born
[1:22:36] again he would have been
[1:22:39] rejoicing even as kaii
[1:22:42] said it is good for one man to die for a
[1:22:49] nation think of
[1:22:52] it the same thing happened to us many
[1:22:55] times until we are born
[1:22:58] again then we can stand certain
[1:23:03] things you see the human
[1:23:07] mind cannot understand the will of
[1:23:11] God cannot understand the purpose of
[1:23:16] God and that is why the Lord said ye
[1:23:19] must be born again for you to be able to
[1:23:23] understand the kingdom
[1:23:27] then he continues to say Jesus answered
[1:23:30] verily very verse five I say unto thee
[1:23:35] except a man be born again be born of
[1:23:38] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[1:23:42] into the
[1:23:43] kingdom that which is of the flesh is
[1:23:48] flesh thus which is born of the spirit
[1:23:53] is Spirit
[1:23:55] Marvel not that I say unto thee ye must
[1:24:00] be born
[1:24:03] again that which is what is is
[1:24:07] flesh is
[1:24:09] flesh and the flesh cannot comprehend
[1:24:12] the things of
[1:24:15] God but the he that is born of
[1:24:19] spirit is
[1:24:21] Spirit it is the spirit that set is the
[1:24:25] things of
[1:24:27] God but the flesh
[1:24:29] cannot and that is why we must be born
[1:24:33] again it is a
[1:24:35] must it is
[1:24:37] imperative for everyone to be born
[1:24:41] again then you can understand the
[1:24:44] kingdom of
[1:24:45] God then you can enter the kingdom of
[1:24:50] God but today we want the shortcut
[1:24:55] but there is no shortcut to the kingdom
[1:24:57] of
[1:24:58] God you have to come the way God has
[1:25:03] provided other than that you
[1:25:10] cannot think of
[1:25:13] it now when you are born again as we
[1:25:18] saying the other time the prophet of God
[1:25:21] said when you are born again there is is
[1:25:24] a small light like this button that
[1:25:28] comes into your
[1:25:32] heart and that small light that is
[1:25:37] God because the Bible tells us God is
[1:25:44] light and the heart is the place that he
[1:25:49] has designated for himself to dwell in
[1:25:55] and any other thing that goes to dwell
[1:25:58] in the heart is a
[1:26:04] squatter because in the Garden of
[1:26:09] Eden Satan and
[1:26:11] God were taking his part their part
[1:26:15] of human the human
[1:26:18] body God chose the heart and Satan chose
[1:26:22] the head
[1:26:25] but the Bible tells us
[1:26:28] what that
[1:26:31] man shall do
[1:26:33] what shall live by
[1:26:36] faith and not by your
[1:26:40] sight Satan leads men through his sight
[1:26:44] what he hears what he sees what he
[1:26:48] feels but God goes beyond those things
[1:26:56] God leades by
[1:26:57] faith faith is a
[1:27:03] revelation and when you have
[1:27:06] faith then you can walk with God because
[1:27:10] God is the
[1:27:13] supernatural all that we see today is
[1:27:18] temporal but what we do not see is
[1:27:21] eternal
[1:27:27] Satan knows
[1:27:29] that in the message serpent
[1:27:33] seed brother Brenham was explaining
[1:27:36] something and he used the word Maha I
[1:27:39] don't know what we saw it last week last
[1:27:43] Wednesday m a h a
[1:27:46] h that is knowing the principles of
[1:27:52] Life say knows the principles of Light
[1:27:57] of
[1:28:00] Life he knows human being he studies
[1:28:03] human being you know he has been here
[1:28:06] more than 6,000
[1:28:08] years and he studies
[1:28:12] us Satan studies you he studies me he
[1:28:16] knows what you
[1:28:19] like and it is through the things that
[1:28:22] you like that he will set a trap for
[1:28:30] you you see and God also God knows us
[1:28:36] more than Satan knows
[1:28:39] you you
[1:28:41] see and that is why he said man shall
[1:28:44] not live by what bread
[1:28:46] alone but by every word that proceeded
[1:28:49] out of the mouth of
[1:28:51] God so we were created to live by the
[1:28:55] word of
[1:28:58] God and to be led of
[1:29:04] himself think of
[1:29:06] that he that is of born of flesh is
[1:29:12] flesh but he that is of the
[1:29:15] spirit is
[1:29:17] Spirit and the spirit designs everything
[1:29:25] think of
[1:29:27] it so the man that is Born
[1:29:31] Again is ready to walk with the
[1:29:36] supernatural because this
[1:29:39] flesh only look at the outside
[1:29:42] things but there is an inner man the
[1:29:46] supernatural
[1:29:49] man we are called to walk by the
[1:29:53] supernatural not by the
[1:29:56] natural the natural will
[1:29:58] perish but the
[1:30:01] supernatural will dwell
[1:30:05] forever think of
[1:30:08] it walking with the
[1:30:11] Supernatural is very very important
[1:30:15] brother Bram me the
[1:30:18] message believe I brought it in the
[1:30:20] message looking onto the
[1:30:22] Unseen he says
[1:30:30] man looking at the uncen preach
[1:30:34] 1958 the prophet of God says this he
[1:30:40] says it is a strength thing that man who
[1:30:44] was made in the image and the likeness
[1:30:48] of God was called of him to walk
[1:30:54] by faith believing that God is and will
[1:30:59] choose to walk by sight instead of by
[1:31:06] faith that is a pathetic
[1:31:10] thing then he continued to say that
[1:31:14] after man was made after his
[1:31:18] makeup his being and all that dwells in
[1:31:22] him was fashioned in the likeness of
[1:31:27] God so as you are seated
[1:31:30] there you are fashion after the likeness
[1:31:34] of
[1:31:37] God now when man lost his position in
[1:31:40] the
[1:31:41] garden Jesus came to restore what Adam
[1:31:45] lost in the
[1:31:48] garden all the powers that we lost
[1:31:52] Christ came by the word to restore it
[1:31:58] back he didn't restore by any other
[1:32:01] thing but by the
[1:32:06] word then he continued to say
[1:32:10] this he said and
[1:32:13] God is that great
[1:32:16] Jehovah who calls those
[1:32:19] things which were
[1:32:21] not as though they were way and
[1:32:26] man made to live with God in this
[1:32:32] manner yet he has chosen to walk by his
[1:32:36] sight he wants to be his own
[1:32:44] boss God has created
[1:32:47] you in order to dwell in
[1:32:51] you that he will lead you that he will
[1:32:55] guide
[1:32:55] you but man has chosen to walk by his
[1:33:02] sight but God wants him to do what to
[1:33:06] walk by
[1:33:10] faith and that faith is a
[1:33:14] man is that Supernatural man the inner
[1:33:18] one that is in you and he wants to Lead
[1:33:22] You by that
[1:33:25] the man wants to be his own
[1:33:29] boss instead of letting the the the the
[1:33:32] higher boss the great
[1:33:35] boss to lead
[1:33:38] him but he's desire I want to go by
[1:33:45] myself but in the beginning it wasn't
[1:33:52] so think of
[1:33:55] that God created the Earth for his
[1:33:58] children for his sons and
[1:34:02] daughters that through his
[1:34:04] Spirit he will lead
[1:34:11] them I like to read the
[1:34:15] prophet and the prophet
[1:34:20] says yet he has chosen to walk by his
[1:34:23] sight
[1:34:24] he wants to be his own boss he wants no
[1:34:28] one to tell him what to
[1:34:31] do that is just the nature of man he
[1:34:36] proved to be thus in the Garden of Eden
[1:34:41] when he had lost his fellowship with God
[1:34:46] by chosing to go his own way not to have
[1:34:50] any one ruled over him
[1:34:57] sometime in a local church you see some
[1:35:01] people who don't want to be
[1:35:05] led anything that they will tell him
[1:35:07] they will tell them they want to go
[1:35:10] their own
[1:35:14] way and as they walk along move
[1:35:18] along when they face the
[1:35:21] obstacle then they come they will come
[1:35:23] back
[1:35:26] but why didn't you take instruction from
[1:35:28] the very
[1:35:31] beginning that is a problem of
[1:35:34] man that is the nature of man the Fallen
[1:35:40] man but if you want to be successful
[1:35:43] with
[1:35:44] God take him at his
[1:35:52] word if you want to go a long way with
[1:35:57] God start thinking
[1:36:00] right the prophet of God says what think
[1:36:05] right but that is your duty to
[1:36:09] yourself and act
[1:36:12] right that is your duty to
[1:36:17] God for you to be able to walk with God
[1:36:21] you need to start thinking right
[1:36:25] and act
[1:36:28] right for the Bible says what we should
[1:36:32] not be conformed to this present
[1:36:36] world but we should be what
[1:36:39] transformed by the renewing of our
[1:36:44] minds and when your mind is
[1:36:46] renewed then you know the will of
[1:36:52] God then you know what God is expecting
[1:36:55] of
[1:36:58] you but when your mind is not
[1:37:02] renewed you walk in
[1:37:07] darkness you walk in darkness until you
[1:37:11] are born
[1:37:13] again then you'll know that you are
[1:37:15] walking in the
[1:37:20] light it's a serious thing
[1:37:24] that today many
[1:37:26] people don't want
[1:37:29] to abide by the
[1:37:33] word because if you abide by the word
[1:37:37] you are saving yourself from
[1:37:40] trouble As Long as You Want To Be Your
[1:37:43] Own
[1:37:45] Boss you always find
[1:37:50] obstacles look at the prodal son
[1:37:55] when he got his share of his
[1:37:58] inheritance and went
[1:38:01] away sconed all that he had taken as
[1:38:05] inheritance and he found himself eating
[1:38:08] with
[1:38:10] pigs then he
[1:38:13] remembered when I used to be with my
[1:38:16] father things were
[1:38:22] different the very moment you think of
[1:38:27] going out of
[1:38:29] headship you can't yourself as
[1:38:34] dead the very moment the prodal son left
[1:38:37] the Father the headship of the father he
[1:38:41] was
[1:38:43] dead and when he realized that ah In My
[1:38:47] Father's House it wasn't it wasn't like
[1:38:50] that then the grace of God
[1:38:54] brought him back to the
[1:38:58] headship so it is for every
[1:39:03] Christian in every local
[1:39:07] church where you
[1:39:10] fail to be under the
[1:39:14] headship know that you are heading for
[1:39:19] trouble the pastor must not might not be
[1:39:22] educated
[1:39:24] he might not be
[1:39:25] rich but God has deposited something in
[1:39:29] him to be able to guide you to be able
[1:39:33] to lead
[1:39:36] you many times people are
[1:39:40] arrogant you tell them
[1:39:42] things I know what I'm
[1:39:46] doing and by the time you realize you
[1:39:50] find yourself in trouble
[1:39:53] you could have saved yourself from
[1:39:55] trouble by just
[1:39:58] listening I was going to read something
[1:40:00] from you you know brother Dam had a
[1:40:04] friend brother uh Dr Sam
[1:40:08] ad yeah been
[1:40:12] classmates
[1:40:15] and one time he wanted to acquire a
[1:40:19] certain
[1:40:20] property came to the prophet prophet was
[1:40:23] talking to him said uh go ahead get
[1:40:28] it and he said to the
[1:40:31] prophet i b i beli you all these
[1:40:36] years but for this prophet in fight in
[1:40:40] fact I find it difficult to believe
[1:40:43] you and brother Bram told him I don't
[1:40:47] know if I can get a quot he told him go
[1:40:51] ahead and get the
[1:40:54] property it's for
[1:40:59] you and I think I'll find
[1:41:05] yeah I may find it now he said go ahead
[1:41:09] and get
[1:41:10] it
[1:41:12] so you know the property owners were in
[1:41:16] Boston and uh the day before he came to
[1:41:20] the Prophet The Prophet said
[1:41:25] dock is for you go and get
[1:41:29] it and he was a little bit
[1:41:33] skeptical so the following day they call
[1:41:37] him and he got a
[1:41:40] prophecy and then he go he called
[1:41:42] brother
[1:41:44] branam he said I'm
[1:41:48] freezing why CU I've already bought a
[1:41:51] property
[1:41:55] when a prophet was telling
[1:41:58] him it was difficult for him to accept
[1:42:01] that because he was looking at
[1:42:05] circumstances around that
[1:42:09] property but he said I read something
[1:42:12] the other said when God says
[1:42:15] something is bound to
[1:42:18] happen where was
[1:42:21] God in that simple
[1:42:26] men think of
[1:42:28] that you might be doing
[1:42:31] something you will go to your
[1:42:34] pastor Pastor will give you
[1:42:38] advice and you fail
[1:42:41] to take the pastest
[1:42:45] advice and by the time you
[1:42:48] realize you are in a deep problem
[1:42:53] you go back to the
[1:42:56] pastor in
[1:42:58] shame and when he was giving you the
[1:43:01] advice he will not tell you that God has
[1:43:03] told me
[1:43:06] this maybe you have told him that he
[1:43:08] went to pray and he came back to you do
[1:43:12] this do that do
[1:43:15] that and if you are spiritual man you
[1:43:18] know that this man is a man of God
[1:43:23] but many of us fail many
[1:43:27] times to he to
[1:43:32] advice but
[1:43:34] as
[1:43:36] sheep we are called to do
[1:43:39] what to listen to pay heed to the
[1:43:45] advice of our
[1:43:50] pastor I'm not trying to
[1:43:55] to give flowers
[1:43:57] to your pastor but what is true we have
[1:44:01] to preach
[1:44:04] it not that he's here or he has invited
[1:44:08] me but what is true is
[1:44:16] true the prophet continued to say what I
[1:44:20] was
[1:44:21] reading in the the
[1:44:25] message look looking to
[1:44:29] Invisible the prophet continue to say
[1:44:32] that and man when he
[1:44:35] chooses as the day goes on go on we find
[1:44:40] man continually getting worse choosing
[1:44:44] rather to walk by
[1:44:47] sight down the stead of by Faith by the
[1:44:52] Unseen
[1:44:53] and when he does that he robs the inner
[1:44:58] man which is the
[1:45:01] soul and that is the Eternal part of
[1:45:07] man now when you want to walk by
[1:45:12] yourself the prophet is saying what you
[1:45:15] rob the the inner
[1:45:21] man but is there in a man that should be
[1:45:25] the true
[1:45:28] leader that is the part of God that is
[1:45:31] in
[1:45:32] you there is the Eternal part that is in
[1:45:38] you and remember things that you do not
[1:45:42] see are
[1:45:45] Eternal but those that you see are
[1:45:50] temporal the inner man which is the
[1:45:54] Supernatural is what we have to live by
[1:45:58] is the one that leads
[1:46:01] us because the god that brought you on
[1:46:04] Earth he knows
[1:46:07] everything and when he comes to dwell in
[1:46:11] you he knows where to lead you
[1:46:17] to walking by the
[1:46:21] supernatural you can cannot avoid
[1:46:24] that as children of
[1:46:26] God the Bible says what the footsteps of
[1:46:30] the
[1:46:31] righteous are ordained of
[1:46:35] God so the born again
[1:46:39] Christian always has that
[1:46:41] desire to do the will of God to please
[1:46:48] God and ask any Minister that come here
[1:46:52] to pray preach and preaches the
[1:46:56] truth there is something that pulsate in
[1:46:59] your in your
[1:47:01] heart just like the nurses
[1:47:05] when patients come to the
[1:47:07] hospital the first thing that they do
[1:47:10] they take their temperature and their
[1:47:15] pool and when the word of God is being
[1:47:18] preached there is a pulsation
[1:47:23] in your heart in your
[1:47:25] soul telling you this is the
[1:47:29] truth this is the
[1:47:32] truth and when you come out you always
[1:47:36] want to do the right thing you'll always
[1:47:40] desire to be led of
[1:47:42] him because the leading of the spirit
[1:47:46] never
[1:47:48] fails your sight can fail you your
[1:47:52] feeling can fail
[1:47:56] you but the inner man can never fail
[1:48:03] you walking with the
[1:48:10] supernatural the spiritual man in the
[1:48:14] Insight if you give him the right way he
[1:48:20] might lead you to a little mission
[1:48:24] somewhere where there is not many
[1:48:27] people but there is the spirit of the
[1:48:31] Living
[1:48:34] God for the outside men Fe on
[1:48:39] psychology
[1:48:41] intellectual but the Inside Man fits on
[1:48:45] the word of
[1:48:47] God now
[1:48:49] today all over the world people want
[1:48:53] mega
[1:48:56] churches they want big
[1:48:59] crowds and they despise little churches
[1:49:02] like this
[1:49:05] one but I'm not saying that God is not
[1:49:08] in those mega churches if he leads you
[1:49:12] fine they're
[1:49:14] fine you see but man God has created you
[1:49:20] that he himself will lead you now
[1:49:23] sometime people look at what how well
[1:49:26] the people are
[1:49:27] dressed the big building the stles and
[1:49:31] all those things but that is not always
[1:49:34] the
[1:49:36] thing if you are praying and looking for
[1:49:39] a church wait on
[1:49:44] God you know
[1:49:47] that to choose a church is like choosing
[1:49:50] a bride
[1:49:54] because the prophet of God tells us that
[1:49:58] before you get you choose your
[1:50:00] wife you have to
[1:50:04] pray pray a long
[1:50:08] time and God's at God's Own
[1:50:11] time he will lead you to the the
[1:50:16] sister that he wants you to
[1:50:19] marry so it is for a church
[1:50:23] churches have
[1:50:27] Spirit you must know that churches have
[1:50:33] spirits in the same when you are looking
[1:50:36] for a bride the prophet said what you
[1:50:39] must do a background
[1:50:42] check you must share the background of
[1:50:45] that
[1:50:48] family to know the kind of family that
[1:50:51] is
[1:50:53] because families have
[1:50:58] Spirits you go and marry
[1:51:02] somebody you cry all your
[1:51:06] life you cannot come out of
[1:51:09] it for marriage is what until
[1:51:16] death so it is for a
[1:51:20] church churches have spirits
[1:51:23] and you must pray for God to lead
[1:51:26] you to where to
[1:51:29] worship where your soul will be
[1:51:33] fed where your spirit will be at
[1:51:39] ease are you choose a
[1:51:44] church you have a lot of
[1:51:49] problem walking with the supernatural
[1:51:56] think of
[1:51:57] it he that is born of the
[1:52:00] flesh is
[1:52:02] flesh but he that is born of the
[1:52:06] spirit is Spirit your desire will always
[1:52:11] be to be led by the
[1:52:16] spirit and that is why the Lord was
[1:52:19] always telling the people it's not me
[1:52:22] that do where those
[1:52:23] works is my father in
[1:52:27] me is the supernatural in
[1:52:31] me the mechanics only has the the the
[1:52:37] Dynamics and that is so in this
[1:52:40] age the people failed to
[1:52:44] see the supernatural in the
[1:52:49] prophets think of that
[1:52:55] Peter and
[1:52:56] John one time they were going to the to
[1:53:00] Worship in the
[1:53:03] temple they have gone there many many
[1:53:07] times but this time as they were
[1:53:10] entering they saw
[1:53:12] that
[1:53:14] man at a g
[1:53:16] beautiful they have seen him many
[1:53:19] times but this day this time when they
[1:53:22] were
[1:53:24] going that man asked for
[1:53:27] money Peter and John
[1:53:31] stopped look at
[1:53:35] this and Peter said Silver and Gold Have
[1:53:40] I
[1:53:40] None but such as I
[1:53:43] have I give unto
[1:53:46] you what was it the leading of the
[1:53:49] spirit
[1:53:54] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:53:57] their
[1:53:59] strength and it's always good to wait on
[1:54:02] the
[1:54:05] Lord you don't hesitate to do
[1:54:09] things spiritual people
[1:54:12] sometime they wait and wait and
[1:54:15] wait until God talks speaks to
[1:54:19] them and they go and do what
[1:54:22] God tells them to
[1:54:24] do but this man he wants everything
[1:54:31] quick everything quick quick quick but
[1:54:34] the inner man he
[1:54:36] waits until the appropriate
[1:54:39] time God comes
[1:54:42] down speak to him and he follow the
[1:54:46] leadership of God
[1:54:52] think of
[1:54:57] it brother B was talking
[1:55:02] about young
[1:55:04] men and
[1:55:06] women one day he was driving
[1:55:09] somewhere going to
[1:55:12] church and then listening to some
[1:55:18] debates some young men were debating
[1:55:23] about
[1:55:24] something the most important
[1:55:27] things on
[1:55:29] earth and
[1:55:32] some young man was thinking
[1:55:35] about the girl with a the best curly
[1:55:41] hair and the girl was thinking of what a
[1:55:46] boy with the blue
[1:55:50] eyes but that is not the most most
[1:55:52] important
[1:55:53] thing the prophet said the most
[1:55:55] important thing is finding your
[1:56:02] God you
[1:56:04] see and that comes back to what praying
[1:56:08] before choosing your
[1:56:11] bride many time people choose by
[1:56:15] sight you see a beautiful
[1:56:18] sister or say this is the
[1:56:20] one you go go in for
[1:56:24] her after the first giving birth to two
[1:56:27] three
[1:56:29] children you look at oh this is not
[1:56:33] what I was looking
[1:56:36] for then your eyes will be looking
[1:56:40] somewhere you would have missed your
[1:56:44] goal you didn't pray before you entered
[1:56:48] in but if you have really prayed
[1:56:53] God would has given you what he want you
[1:56:57] to to
[1:57:00] marry you see today there are many divor
[1:57:03] even in the
[1:57:04] message why because the people did not
[1:57:08] take time to pray and wait upon the
[1:57:13] Lord and those you of you young men and
[1:57:16] young sister who have not yet
[1:57:19] married wait on the Lord
[1:57:23] pray and at God's Own time he will bring
[1:57:27] you the man that is fit for you you'll
[1:57:30] bring to you the woman that is fit for
[1:57:36] you it's very
[1:57:38] important but many times we neglect that
[1:57:44] many time when those things are preached
[1:57:46] it's so because you've already married
[1:57:49] you don't want us to marry but that is
[1:57:52] not the
[1:57:53] case the pastor only wants what is best
[1:57:57] for
[1:57:59] you when a man catch once catches that
[1:58:03] vision of the invisible God and know
[1:58:07] that he is always
[1:58:09] present there is something that
[1:58:12] stabilizes his man uh the man's thinking
[1:58:17] it
[1:58:18] stabilizes his action
[1:58:23] in the time of distress and trouble it
[1:58:27] will still make him look upward and
[1:58:31] above all the things that are happening
[1:58:34] around him because he's looking at the
[1:58:40] Unseen and yet by
[1:58:45] promise so we want our soul to be
[1:58:49] stabilized we want our action to
[1:58:52] stabilize because you are looking on the
[1:58:58] Unseen because God has made
[1:59:02] promises and he watches over his
[1:59:05] promises to fulfill them as his own
[1:59:11] time if he says that you must be born
[1:59:16] again it is a
[1:59:19] promise and what you need to do
[1:59:22] take it to God lord you make this
[1:59:27] promise I need the Holy
[1:59:31] Spirit wait on
[1:59:33] him take him by his
[1:59:37] word and as God's appropriate
[1:59:41] time he will bring it to
[1:59:44] pass when he told the
[1:59:47] disciples wait in Jerusalem
[1:59:53] before Jesus go he told
[1:59:56] them I'm going to give you power from on
[1:59:59] high but what you need to do wait in
[2:00:04] Jerusalem and when they took Jesus at
[2:00:08] his word they were gathered in the upper
[2:00:12] room for nine days they were
[2:00:16] there and on the 10th day what happened
[2:00:21] he came
[2:00:22] like a rushing Mighty Wind to fulfill
[2:00:26] the promise that he gave to
[2:00:31] them God can never fail his
[2:00:36] promises but what we need to do take him
[2:00:38] at his word and wait upon
[2:00:43] him and when you wait upon Him He will
[2:00:47] surely visit
[2:00:50] you he called
[2:00:55] Abraham and gave him a
[2:00:58] promise the prophet of God said when God
[2:01:01] heard that voice Abraham heard that
[2:01:04] voice he took his
[2:01:07] backpack and followed that
[2:01:12] voice he followed the
[2:01:15] Supernatural and waited for 25 good
[2:01:20] years and as he was
[2:01:22] waiting people were laughing at him
[2:01:26] people were mocking at
[2:01:29] him as James or Timothy said I think
[2:01:32] James I know whom I have
[2:01:37] believed and that what I committed unto
[2:01:40] him is able to
[2:01:45] keep and Abraham was following the
[2:01:48] supernatural in spite of all the
[2:01:51] mockeries
[2:01:52] he was looking at the
[2:01:55] supernatural he didn't look at his body
[2:01:59] as being
[2:02:00] old but he look unto him that was
[2:02:04] invisible and believed the
[2:02:08] promise and at God's appointed time the
[2:02:12] promise sound
[2:02:16] came think of
[2:02:18] it our God is a pro keeping
[2:02:24] God he never fails but what you need to
[2:02:28] do you have to recognize that he is
[2:02:32] God and when you approach him in
[2:02:36] prayer you must know that he's
[2:02:38] God that he
[2:02:41] exists and that he never
[2:02:48] fails but one thing you
[2:02:50] know when you we are going before
[2:02:54] God the very moment you go on your knees
[2:02:57] start
[2:02:58] praying Satan will start bringing
[2:03:04] thoughts you'll bring this and this and
[2:03:09] that but Jesus was telling the
[2:03:14] people when you want to pray what you
[2:03:16] need to do go into your secret closets
[2:03:21] and shut the
[2:03:23] door and pray in the
[2:03:28] secrets and the prayer you do in the
[2:03:31] secret he reward you
[2:03:34] publicly but there is another closet
[2:03:37] that you have to to shut the door
[2:03:40] on that is your
[2:03:45] mind you got to know how to shut your
[2:03:48] mind to the devil
[2:03:52] and when you go on your
[2:03:54] knees and
[2:03:58] pray God is bound to answer
[2:04:04] you Satan he knows certain
[2:04:10] principles and that is why he will
[2:04:12] hinder you in certain
[2:04:14] things but you must also know him you
[2:04:18] must know his principles too
[2:04:24] is is very
[2:04:27] important and as I was saying think
[2:04:30] right that is your duty to
[2:04:33] yourself and act right that is your duty
[2:04:37] to
[2:04:44] God and when your minds mind is always
[2:04:50] positive when you go on your knes have
[2:04:52] that positive
[2:04:56] mind that God is
[2:04:58] a an answering I mean what do I say it's
[2:05:03] a prayer answering
[2:05:06] God be
[2:05:08] positive and go to
[2:05:10] him this is my trouble this is my desire
[2:05:15] this is what I
[2:05:17] want and be positive about it
[2:05:21] yes
[2:05:23] amen because the Inner
[2:05:26] Man create an
[2:05:31] atmosphere the inner man is a
[2:05:36] Creator and as you walk with him you
[2:05:39] walk in that
[2:05:43] atmosphere and it's the atmosphere that
[2:05:45] bring the
[2:05:50] results we don't without that creative
[2:05:55] atmosphere you cannot obtain
[2:06:00] results you are little
[2:06:05] Gods you are
[2:06:08] creators you can create that
[2:06:11] atmosphere and live in that atmosphere
[2:06:21] I think he perfect
[2:06:23] Faith the prophet of God was saying
[2:06:29] that Jesus was a Mystic to the
[2:06:35] people and if you're begotten of
[2:06:39] God those elements of God are in
[2:06:43] you you become a
[2:06:48] Creator and the inner man has potential
[2:06:53] yes as well as the outside
[2:06:56] man but the outside man
[2:07:00] potential only lasts till
[2:07:04] death but the inner man's potential is
[2:07:07] up to
[2:07:10] Eternity and that is why we have to
[2:07:13] dwell most on the inner
[2:07:16] man the inner man has immense potentials
[2:07:21] unmeasurable
[2:07:25] potentials and when you depend on the
[2:07:27] inner
[2:07:28] man you become a Mystic to the
[2:07:36] people think of
[2:07:38] it
[2:07:40] Nicodemus he had his
[2:07:44] share God was telling him
[2:07:47] yeah you are a master in Israel people
[2:07:51] look up to
[2:07:52] you and this thing that I'm telling you
[2:07:55] you do not
[2:07:57] understand you really need to be born
[2:08:02] again you see we can never overemphasize
[2:08:07] the new
[2:08:09] birth is very
[2:08:12] important but
[2:08:14] today we take it
[2:08:17] lightly God doesn't want us to take it
[2:08:19] lightly
[2:08:22] he want
[2:08:23] us to take it
[2:08:26] seriously the new
[2:08:28] birth now when we talk of
[2:08:31] Moses Moses made a
[2:08:34] choice in the me in the message by faith
[2:08:40] Moses barram was saying
[2:08:44] this I want to take the subject this
[2:08:48] morning Choosing by faith
[2:08:51] and I want to take for a test the first
[2:08:54] three words of the 23rd chapter by faith
[2:08:59] Moses Noel I think he took it from first
[2:09:03] or second
[2:09:04] John and said and Choosing by
[2:09:09] faith most everything that we do we have
[2:09:14] to choose by
[2:09:16] faith most everything that we do we have
[2:09:21] to choose by
[2:09:24] faith then he
[2:09:26] says and all that we find that Moses did
[2:09:32] that is worth
[2:09:34] repeating was by
[2:09:37] faith not by
[2:09:40] sight but by
[2:09:43] faith did you get
[2:09:47] it he
[2:09:49] says we find that Moses
[2:09:52] did all that he did that is worth
[2:09:56] repeating and we are repeating it again
[2:09:59] this
[2:10:00] morning that he did it by
[2:10:03] faith not by
[2:10:06] sight when Moses was in
[2:10:09] Egypt he was to be the next
[2:10:15] Pharaoh but there was a day he and
[2:10:19] Pharaoh they looked through the same
[2:10:23] window looking at the children of
[2:10:26] Israel working in the
[2:10:30] mouth but Pharaoh through his physical
[2:10:34] eyes he saw
[2:10:36] slaves he some mad
[2:10:39] doers but
[2:10:42] Moses looked through his by his
[2:10:46] heart and what did he
[2:10:49] see he see children of
[2:10:52] God and he chose to identify
[2:10:57] himself with what Pharaoh saw as
[2:11:01] slaves but to Moses they were not
[2:11:05] slaves they were Sons and Daughters of
[2:11:09] God and he chose to identify himself
[2:11:13] with them and suffer with
[2:11:19] them think of that Choosing by faith if
[2:11:24] you choose by faith you will walk by
[2:11:30] faith Moses chose by
[2:11:33] faith and that Faith led him to identify
[2:11:38] himself to those
[2:11:41] people think of
[2:11:44] it walking by
[2:11:47] faith walking by the supernatural
[2:11:53] it's not always
[2:11:56] easy but you need to be
[2:12:00] determined you know to have an anchor
[2:12:02] over
[2:12:04] there and if you have that
[2:12:07] anchor it will always hold any any time
[2:12:12] anywhere under any
[2:12:16] circumstance that anchor will hold
[2:12:22] think of
[2:12:25] it
[2:12:27] Daniel and his three other
[2:12:30] friends in
[2:12:35] Babylon they have taking the
[2:12:39] decision not to defile
[2:12:42] themselves by the things of
[2:12:47] Babylon the purpose in their hearts
[2:12:51] not to defile
[2:12:53] themselves by the things of
[2:12:57] Babylon there were many in
[2:13:00] Babylon but these four people the
[2:13:04] purpose in their
[2:13:05] hearts not to defile
[2:13:12] themselves and they went through
[2:13:16] things the position that they
[2:13:20] took they were Tried by that the
[2:13:23] decision that they
[2:13:25] took they were Tried by
[2:13:30] it think of
[2:13:34] Joseph the word that came to
[2:13:37] him tried
[2:13:42] him and he came out
[2:13:47] right you
[2:13:49] see now this man say that we
[2:13:52] believe we will be Tried by
[2:13:59] it and if you know your God that the god
[2:14:03] that brought this
[2:14:05] message and everybody everyone that
[2:14:07] believes
[2:14:09] it he will stand by
[2:14:15] him that will be your
[2:14:18] defense you know that God have made the
[2:14:21] promise he said I'll not leave you nor
[2:14:24] forsake
[2:14:25] you I will be with you even in you if
[2:14:30] you go through fire he's in fire with
[2:14:35] you if you have that
[2:14:39] Consciousness you know
[2:14:42] that he is with
[2:14:45] you that will be your
[2:14:47] anchor that will be your rest
[2:14:53] because he made a
[2:14:56] promise he will never turn his back to
[2:15:03] you walking by
[2:15:14] faith Prophet said he said and the
[2:15:18] reason that I have selected said this
[2:15:22] this
[2:15:23] morning for the church in this state has
[2:15:28] been that in our even our
[2:15:32] schools and
[2:15:34] around we've had we've had uh so much of
[2:15:39] science scientific
[2:15:41] teachings
[2:15:43] because of this we have drawn the people
[2:15:49] away from
[2:15:51] Faith now Faith is not proved by
[2:15:56] science faith is what science doesn't
[2:16:01] see if we ever lose this great
[2:16:05] faith then we are totally in
[2:16:10] darkness no matter how well we are
[2:16:15] educated how we could explain the word
[2:16:19] of God to Su our own way of
[2:16:25] believing there is no way to ever please
[2:16:29] God Only By
[2:16:31] Faith the scripture plainly states
[2:16:35] that that way and is by faith and
[2:16:40] without faith says the Scripture it is
[2:16:44] impossible to please
[2:16:48] God now we are in the same situation yes
[2:16:51] look at how sound science is
[2:16:55] advancing and drawing people away from
[2:17:02] Faith but God want say to do what to
[2:17:04] walk by
[2:17:06] faith look at achievement of science
[2:17:10] today many things are
[2:17:14] happening the drones the cell
[2:17:18] phones somebody can be here and Target
[2:17:21] somebody in
[2:17:22] Iran and kill him on a
[2:17:26] spot think of
[2:17:28] that but God was his children not to
[2:17:32] depend on
[2:17:34] signs but to depend on him to walk by
[2:17:39] faith and to live by
[2:17:44] faith think of
[2:17:48] that today when people don't have
[2:17:53] money they easily fall on their credit
[2:17:57] cards no more going on the needs to
[2:18:04] pray do you get
[2:18:06] me but whatever need that we have the
[2:18:10] first thing that we have to do is to go
[2:18:13] on our
[2:18:17] needs the credit is going to fail some
[2:18:20] some
[2:18:22] day money is going to fail
[2:18:26] someday it did fail one day in
[2:18:29] Egypt and it's going to fail again it's
[2:18:33] been
[2:18:35] prophesied P children and Daughters of
[2:18:38] God what we need to
[2:18:40] do go on our
[2:18:43] knees make our
[2:18:45] requests and supplication be our request
[2:18:48] be known
[2:18:51] by
[2:18:53] supplication that is what God expect
[2:18:56] from
[2:18:58] you because God has
[2:19:02] resources unseen
[2:19:05] resources and by faith we can tap into
[2:19:09] that
[2:19:14] resource think of
[2:19:16] it walking with the supernatural
[2:19:22] God wants her to walk with
[2:19:24] him he told
[2:19:26] Abraham walk before me and be thou
[2:19:32] perfect and Abraham did
[2:19:37] that he told him of a
[2:19:40] city and Abraham by faith will go here
[2:19:44] and
[2:19:45] there he didn't go by
[2:19:49] sight but he went
[2:19:51] by the inner
[2:19:53] man searching for that
[2:19:58] City you see brother in a message said
[2:20:03] today I can see him rejoicing in that
[2:20:08] City and all he seed will also do the
[2:20:17] same children of God
[2:20:21] walk by
[2:20:23] faith live by
[2:20:26] faith that is the way
[2:20:29] God wants you to
[2:20:32] live is very
[2:20:35] important our makeup is
[2:20:39] different the prophet continues to say
[2:20:42] now if we lose
[2:20:45] Faith then we will never get a prayer
[2:20:49] answered by God
[2:20:53] if I lose faith if you lose
[2:20:58] Faith your prayer will never be answered
[2:21:01] by
[2:21:08] God and he said for he that cometh to
[2:21:13] God must first believe that he is and a
[2:21:19] rewarder of those that
[2:21:21] diligently seek after him so if we lose
[2:21:26] faith our prayers are
[2:21:30] aned we get
[2:21:36] nowhere and there is a way we have to
[2:21:39] keep our
[2:21:41] faith because the Inner
[2:21:44] Man Fe on
[2:21:48] something the Inner Man Fe on the word
[2:21:51] of
[2:21:54] God if you don't feed on the word of God
[2:21:58] the Inner Man becomes
[2:22:00] weak the more you feel this
[2:22:03] man the more stronger he will be and the
[2:22:08] weaker the inner
[2:22:10] man but we need to Fe the inner man more
[2:22:14] than we Fe the outside
[2:22:19] man but we feed this one more than the
[2:22:23] inner one but we are called to feed more
[2:22:28] the inner men than the outside
[2:22:32] men you
[2:22:34] remember the two
[2:22:37] dogs the White and the black
[2:22:40] dog but Bram was talking with an Indian
[2:22:46] man and said Chief how is how are things
[2:22:49] going
[2:22:51] say all
[2:22:55] right and then he started talking about
[2:22:58] two
[2:23:01] dogs and then which
[2:23:05] one gets
[2:23:08] stronger he said the one you feed
[2:23:11] more get
[2:23:14] stronger if you feel the black dog more
[2:23:18] he will re over you
[2:23:21] and you you he feel feel the what the
[2:23:23] white one he will be the one that
[2:23:29] Reigns but he said it's not the size of
[2:23:33] the
[2:23:35] dog but the size of the fight in the
[2:23:40] dog that
[2:23:43] matters and if you feed the inner man
[2:23:46] more he becomes stronger
[2:23:52] when you go to prayer
[2:23:54] meeting you hear people
[2:23:58] praying or when they call somebody here
[2:24:00] to come and
[2:24:01] pray the way he prays you will know
[2:24:05] which dog he
[2:24:10] fit it's
[2:24:13] true if a person read the scriptures and
[2:24:17] pray you see that he's praying will be
[2:24:20] CAU in the
[2:24:25] scriptures which dog are you
[2:24:30] feeding which one are you
[2:24:34] feeding the one you feed more controls
[2:24:39] you and
[2:24:41] God want to be in a throne
[2:24:45] room on a control tower
[2:24:50] when he's on the control
[2:24:52] tower you know that everything is under
[2:24:59] control because we have another
[2:25:03] Tower in
[2:25:06] heaven and when he send
[2:25:10] signals the control tower in you receive
[2:25:13] that
[2:25:16] signal you see this cell phone that we
[2:25:18] have today
[2:25:21] they depend on signals
[2:25:25] Towers now you get to a place your
[2:25:29] outside
[2:25:31] coverage and it's difficult for your
[2:25:33] cell phone to be able to to
[2:25:36] receive it will be difficult for you to
[2:25:38] receive
[2:25:40] calls but when you're in a coverage
[2:25:43] area it's easy for you to receive
[2:25:47] calls in the spiritual is the same
[2:25:53] yes God wants us always to be in the
[2:25:55] coverage area under the
[2:26:00] blood then when he speaks from
[2:26:04] Glory the inner man can catch
[2:26:09] it but when you are outside the
[2:26:13] blood he'll be trying to reach you to
[2:26:17] talk to
[2:26:18] you you'll never get it
[2:26:23] and that is why we must constantly be
[2:26:29] connected the in faith connect to
[2:26:34] God but doubt disconnect
[2:26:40] you think of
[2:26:44] it the prophet of God said when you are
[2:26:49] born again
[2:26:51] you become a twofold
[2:26:57] creature the ome men to
[2:27:00] die and the inner man to live
[2:27:06] eternally and when you are born again
[2:27:10] you are a
[2:27:11] candidate of associate to associate with
[2:27:13] angels
[2:27:17] yes he dispatches an angel
[2:27:20] to always to be with you
[2:27:24] yes and somewhere he said when you are
[2:27:26] born
[2:27:27] again and that man is in
[2:27:33] you you become an
[2:27:40] angel and what is an
[2:27:42] angel a
[2:27:45] messenger a carrier of a message
[2:27:53] and when you are so much in tune with
[2:27:56] God God will send
[2:27:58] message go and tell this brother this go
[2:28:02] and tell that sister
[2:28:04] this because you are so much in tune
[2:28:07] with him you are so much connected with
[2:28:13] him and he has confidence in you he send
[2:28:18] message go to this s sister and tell her
[2:28:22] this go to that brother and tell him
[2:28:30] this that is what God wants us to
[2:28:35] be a messenger an
[2:28:39] ambassador and when you are an
[2:28:41] ambassador of
[2:28:44] God like this country sent an ambassador
[2:28:48] to
[2:28:49] Germany the whole brother
[2:28:51] us is behind that
[2:28:55] Ambassador in the same way when you
[2:28:57] become an angel of God a messenger of
[2:29:00] God an ambassador of God the whole
[2:29:03] Heaven is behind
[2:29:08] you walking with the
[2:29:13] supernatural that is what
[2:29:16] God wants of us today
[2:29:21] he wants to walk with us that we are
[2:29:24] Desiring to walk with
[2:29:29] him think of
[2:29:32] it
[2:29:34] God is
[2:29:38] God let me read some few
[2:29:42] things I don't know what time it is
[2:30:02] the prophet of
[2:30:04] God says man is always trying to achieve
[2:30:09] something by his
[2:30:11] head he supposed to
[2:30:14] achieve but by his
[2:30:17] heart that is the control tower
[2:30:21] where God controls him and direct his
[2:30:25] thoughts direct his
[2:30:28] Works direct his
[2:30:32] emotions sometime I get so happy I just
[2:30:36] have to let it
[2:30:38] lose and if I look around and see
[2:30:43] somebody then
[2:30:45] see I got my eyes on people
[2:30:50] then but God help me to keep my eyes
[2:30:56] closed I want to just be led by the
[2:31:00] spirit of
[2:31:02] God that the flesh will have
[2:31:06] nothing to do unto
[2:31:11] it think of
[2:31:15] it maybe you are alone
[2:31:20] worshiping
[2:31:22] God singing worshiping
[2:31:26] him then somebody
[2:31:28] appears then you open your up started
[2:31:31] looking at the
[2:31:33] person and then you become
[2:31:37] shy that is not the way God wants
[2:31:41] it whether there is somebody or not he
[2:31:45] wants you to
[2:31:47] Fellowship he wants you to worship
[2:31:50] yes just like we come to
[2:31:54] church somebody starts singing
[2:31:57] worshiping in the
[2:32:00] spirit no matter who is
[2:32:03] around God wants you to worship and sing
[2:32:07] irrespective for who is around you or
[2:32:13] not that is how he wants our worship to
[2:32:16] be
[2:32:22] you don't care who is around
[2:32:24] you all your mind is on
[2:32:30] him that is how he wants to worship Him
[2:32:33] and when he will worship like that then
[2:32:36] our worship is
[2:32:40] received but when you come to church
[2:32:43] they
[2:32:48] singing no
[2:32:50] that is not
[2:32:52] worship God wants you to worship with
[2:32:55] everything that is in you with your
[2:32:58] strength and
[2:33:05] everything maybe you live you live home
[2:33:08] a little bit
[2:33:10] down and when you come to the house of
[2:33:15] God as you go through that door
[2:33:19] something if you really want to watch
[2:33:21] something Supernatural will happen to
[2:33:27] you you'll be energized
[2:33:32] yes and when you start
[2:33:38] worshiping God will be energizing your
[2:33:42] soul and you worship as you have never
[2:33:44] done
[2:33:46] before that is the way he wants you to
[2:33:49] worship
[2:33:51] he wants your worship he wants my
[2:33:55] worship you see but the this
[2:33:59] man is a lazy
[2:34:02] man this man loves
[2:34:08] pleasure and when this man come under
[2:34:11] the control of the inner
[2:34:15] man then El limited is what he can do
[2:34:19] because the inner man will be
[2:34:21] controlling everything will bring it
[2:34:23] under
[2:34:25] subjection and
[2:34:27] sometime coming to church become
[2:34:31] difficult but you have to drag this man
[2:34:33] to
[2:34:35] church you have to drag him to
[2:34:40] church but when you fall to the dictate
[2:34:43] of this man you cannot come to church
[2:34:50] but God wants to lead
[2:34:52] you God wants this
[2:34:55] man to surrender
[2:35:00] completely then your
[2:35:02] worship will be
[2:35:09] accepted the prophet said
[2:35:12] usually ministers when they get onto the
[2:35:16] pulpit they begin to think
[2:35:19] if I speak on a certain certain
[2:35:23] thing here is a certain member of my
[2:35:27] church that is a good paying in this
[2:35:31] church they will leave the
[2:35:34] church if I don't if I preach that say
[2:35:37] that
[2:35:38] thing and when you go looking at the
[2:35:42] flesh
[2:35:43] again then God
[2:35:47] cannot lead that minister
[2:35:50] you got to say what the spirit says to
[2:35:55] say then we are led by the spirit of
[2:36:04] God you see so many time you come to the
[2:36:09] puppets and God is pressing on your
[2:36:12] heart to say
[2:36:14] something oh if I say this brother oh if
[2:36:18] I say this sister
[2:36:22] they might leave the
[2:36:25] church they can
[2:36:28] leave if they leave God will bring
[2:36:33] somebody but God has a purose for you to
[2:36:36] say that
[2:36:40] thing if you don't say the prophet said
[2:36:44] that God cannot lead you
[2:36:53] God has called you to preach the
[2:36:57] gospel and he impresses something on you
[2:37:01] to
[2:37:03] say and if you say that thing maybe a
[2:37:06] member is going through
[2:37:08] something and he want you to say
[2:37:12] it and when you say it then your heart
[2:37:15] will be discharged
[2:37:22] walking with the
[2:37:30] supernatural now if God can come on the
[2:37:32] control
[2:37:34] tower said my sheep hear my
[2:37:38] voice well
[2:37:40] now all these strange
[2:37:43] voices in the world of this social
[2:37:47] gospel that just belong to church and
[2:37:51] that is all that is
[2:37:53] necessary why hasn't he done
[2:37:57] something is done nothing by confuse the
[2:38:02] people what we need
[2:38:05] tonight is a unified Church filled with
[2:38:09] the Holy Ghost and power from on
[2:38:14] high led by the spirit of the Living God
[2:38:18] on the control tower
[2:38:21] that W
[2:38:22] say because I'm a Baptist and he's a
[2:38:27] Methodist and I have nothing to do with
[2:38:30] him a real true spirit of God who
[2:38:34] recognize his brother or
[2:38:38] sister I don't care what kind of brand
[2:38:42] he is wearing oh we need a
[2:38:46] leadership again of the Holy Spirit
[2:38:50] walking after the
[2:38:52] Unseen the way that God
[2:38:55] listes the things that we see are
[2:38:59] temporal the things that we do not see
[2:39:04] are
[2:39:08] Eternal we need a unified
[2:39:12] mind as a
[2:39:14] church United
[2:39:17] together binded
[2:39:22] together and when we are unified in
[2:39:25] spirit unified in
[2:39:29] Soul then God can
[2:39:33] move but when we have the divided Minds
[2:39:37] it will be difficult for God to
[2:39:41] operate for the Holy Ghost to be able to
[2:39:44] come down that
[2:39:45] day they were all unified in thoughts
[2:39:50] unified in
[2:39:52] hearts in one
[2:39:55] atmosphere and when God saw that he
[2:39:58] poured down a
[2:40:01] spirit that is what God want to see
[2:40:04] among
[2:40:06] us we come with one mind one Accord
[2:40:11] unified with one
[2:40:15] desire then God will come down and
[2:40:19] fulfill feel our grant our
[2:40:22] desires but when we have divided
[2:40:25] opinion he cannot
[2:40:28] move think of
[2:40:32] that thank
[2:40:38] you okay I watch my
[2:40:42] time maybe I'll have to say
[2:40:45] something you know brother bam was PR
[2:40:49] the
[2:40:51] message speak to this
[2:40:53] mountain prach
[2:40:56] 1959 and Sam
[2:40:59] Jose at the end of that
[2:41:02] service he was saying
[2:41:06] something talking about being taken into
[2:41:11] custody now when you take somebody into
[2:41:15] custody you take full charge of the
[2:41:17] person
[2:41:20] you take responsibility of that person
[2:41:23] it's just like sometime divorce
[2:41:26] people they have to go to court and seek
[2:41:29] for who should take this son or I mean
[2:41:32] this child into
[2:41:34] custody and brother Bram was praying and
[2:41:38] say Lord take me into your
[2:41:43] custody I think that is what we need
[2:41:47] today for God
[2:41:50] to take us into his
[2:41:53] custody and he was
[2:41:57] praying and saying this
[2:42:02] thing he
[2:42:05] said I wish I could find that Salon
[2:42:08] brought it he said Lord take me into
[2:42:12] your
[2:42:14] power take me into your custody

[2:42:21] time of
[2:42:25] consecration this is a time of
[2:42:29] dedication take this
[2:42:32] church into your
[2:42:37] custody yeah here it
[2:42:40] is he was
[2:42:43] praying he

[2:42:48] people
[2:42:49] do you believe it let us all rise to our
[2:42:54] feet this is the hour of divine
[2:42:57] consecration if you can
[2:43:01] believe the Lord God requires a
[2:43:06] consecration he cannot break forth upon
[2:43:10] us until we have being so
[2:43:16] surrendered to his will to his
[2:43:19] power he cannot break
[2:43:22] forth until we have our hearts so
[2:43:26] cleansed from sin and things of the
[2:43:30] world until the Holy Ghost can ride in
[2:43:35] Us in upon
[2:43:37] us and surrend us now as he has me
[2:43:47] surrendered how do I know
[2:43:49] these things it's not me it's
[2:43:54] him that is
[2:43:56] speaking I have told you the truth about
[2:44:00] him there is breaking forth something
