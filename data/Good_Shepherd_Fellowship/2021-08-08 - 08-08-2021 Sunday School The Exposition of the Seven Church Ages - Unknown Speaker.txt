========================================

none else would do you have to work from the original as like begets like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her founders at pentecost and her messengers will follow the apostle paul the first messenger to the first church age it is that simple and that wonderful with this key so simple yet so wonderful i was able by the help of the holy spirit to read the book of revelation and the histories and find therein each age each messenger the duration of each age and the part each played in the purpose of god from pentecost to the consummation of those ages since you now understand how we judge what the true church was like what she was at pentecost and what she was in the apostolic age as set forth in the word in the book of acts we can apply the same rule to show us how the church failed the basic error or errors that crept into the first church and were revealed in the books of acts and revelation and also in the epistles will become more and more visibly manifested in each subsequent age until we come to a complete blackout of truth in the last or laodicean age now out of this first key that we have received of the lord there comes another and slightly less wonderful truth i said that the true church would always try to be like it was in the book of acts that is exactly right but we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until there is a complete blackout of truth in the last day when the lord is about to appear the question now arises in our minds does god forsake his own and let them fall into a state of complete deception on no account for the scripture says very clearly in matthew 24 24 that the elect cannot be deceived for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect what then the answer is clear before us there is a true church and a false church there is a true vine and a false vine but of course that false church false vine body will always try to usurp the position of the true church and contend that she and not the elect are the real and authentic the false will try to kill the true that is how it was in the book of acts that is how it is set forth in the seven ages and that is how it is declared in the various epistles that is how it has been that is how it is now that is how it will be it can't change now let us be very careful that we are not confused at this point thus we will seek the word to validate this claim let us go back to the book of the beginning genesis in the garden of eden there were two trees one was good one was evil one produced life the other produced death there were two children who originally offered sacrifices to god let me repeat that they both offered sacrifices to god genesis 4 3-5 and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect but one cain was evil being of his father that wicked one while abel was righteous before the lord again there were two children from the flesh of the same parents they were the twins of isaac and rebecca one was the elect of god and the other was reprobate both worshiped god in every single case there was worship of god involved in every case the evil hated the righteous and persecuted the righteous in some cases the evil destroyed the righteous but notice they were planted together they lived together they both made claims upon god and worshiped god these illustrations depict perfectly the parable of the lord jesus christ when he said that the kingdom of heaven was like unto a man who sowed good seed only to have an enemy come and plant tears amongst those good seeds god did not plant the tares satan planted those tears right amongst the good seed of god those two kinds of plants people from two different seeds grew up together they partook of the nourishment in the same earth they shared in the same sun rain and all other benefits and both were harvested in their turn do you see it don't ever forget these truths as we study the church ages and later the seals and above all don't forget that it is in this last age when the tears are getting bound for their burning that they will shove out the wheat that is to be garnered by the lord i want to carry this thought all the way through so let us go a step further have you ever studied the history of revivals now a revival signifies a move of god in power and every time god moves satan is there to move also it never fails in the days of the great welsh revival and most people don't know this the insane asylums filled up quickly and there was a great display of devil power to take away the attention from god it is written that in wesley's day the people would do most peculiar things that were definitely of satan to try to mock the goodness and power of god in luther's day it is said that the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he successfully protested the roman catholic church but the miracle lay in the fact he could and did stay sound and sane amidst the fanatics who were often filled with and guided by wrong spirits and if you have been aware of this last day ministry you will have noted the same invasion of false and wicked spirits it has to be that way now i hope and trust you are spiritual minded enough to get that and capitalize on it just to seal this point on the true and false vines mingling and demonstrating the two spirits that are at work let us look into first john 4 1-4 and jude 3 4 and 12. beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of god little children and have overcome them antichrist spirit because greater is he god's spirit that is in you than he that is in the world jude 3 4 and 12. beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men not saints crept in unawares these have not come into the fold by means of the door and are therefore robbers who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined having been planted together but of different seeds now then i think there is something else you want to know the seven churches which are addressed by john are in asia minor and are all gentile churches he does not speak to the church at jerusalem which was mostly jewish with perhaps just a few gentiles in it the reason is that god had turned from the jews to the gentiles thus the whole of the church ages is god dealing with the gentiles calling out a gentile bride to himself that makes the church ages and the fullness of the gentiles the one and the same thing acts 13 44-48 and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldst be for salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed romans 11 1-8 i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew what ye not what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to god against israel saying lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life but what sayeth the answer of god unto him i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace and if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then is it no more grace otherwise work is no more work what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day romans 11 25-29 for i would not brethren that ye be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles become in and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance these seven churches located in asia minor contained certain characteristics within them at that ancient date which became the mature fruit of later ages what were just seed plants back there came out later in a mature harvest even as jesus said for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry luke 23 31 the message to the ephesian church age revelation 2 1-7 unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and i labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and hast born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have someone against thee because thou hast left thy first love remember therefore from once thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou hast that thou hate is the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god over this series here the seven church age book here um brother one really wanted us to go over it and listen to it because bill graham told us he said every major doctrine from the scripture have been encapsulated in this teaching and for us to go back over for those of us who have been in the message many many years it's good for us to go back and review and for those of us that are just in for have just been in just two days or just the last couple of years or maybe you've been grown up in the message but you've never paid much attention this is good things for you to be aware of and it's the history and teachings of the church and what we believe and it'll seat you and ground you where you need to be just real quick if you'll put up ii timothy 2 15. i'm going to read it real quick here it says study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth and that is really our focus with these sunday schools is not so much just to give you something to listen to or to burn up time but it's to stir you up to go back and study and be approved so when you would have someone ask you what is it that you believe you wouldn't be caught off guard you know and we went ahead and passed out some questions i think what was it going on was it last sunday and it's not really it's not you know trick questions or anything like that it's just in the midst of our busy lives sometimes if we don't have something to that we need to do then it's just kind of in one ear and out the other but what we want you to do is go back and just kind of go over them what i'm going to do real quick here is we're going to take the questions that we handed out from the first three sections of the church age book and i'm just going to go over the questions real quick if anyone does have a question pertaining go ahead and raise your hand and i can see if i can answer it a little bit more in depthly real quick i do have 110 questions that we're going to go over in the next 15 minutes so if it's something i can't answer right on the spot then we'll get it written down or write it down for me and we'll get it answered maybe next service so if you have your questions with you that's great if not i will read both the question and the answer like i said these aren't tricks or anything like that it's nothing trying to you know figure out how spiritual you are it's more or less questions sending you back to the material did did you read it did you pay attention are you catching what's going on um all right so we're going to start from the top and go on down uh the first question where were the seven churches located and that was in asia um and actual fact i just realized that brother adam goes over that material multiple times because here in the ephesian church age he just mentioned that what has jesus christ made us we know that jesus christ has made us both kings and priests not just to come but even now on which isle or island was john located when this happened he was on the isle of patmos and he was put there for the crime of the gospel which is rome put him there on the isle of patmos to punish him and the isle of patmos was right where god wanted him in order to get him alone by himself to bring him this revelation when was john in the spirit john was in the spirit on the lord's day and you know it's not saturday it's not sunday the lord's day is the day that he comes to you to speak to your heart it could be on a monday it could be on a tuesday get in the spirit and you'll be on the lord's day what did john see in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks john saw one like and unto the son of man what did what did the one that john saw have in his right hand he had seven stars what were the seven stars and seven candlesticks now we know by the message of a prophet that the seven stars were seven messengers and the seven candlesticks were seven church ages and each star was a messenger to each church age what is the only book in the bible that was written by jesus himself we believe that to be the book of revelations was written by christ himself and john was simply the man with a pen there to scribe as a scribe to write it down who do the catholics say the church is built upon the catholic church says that the church is built upon peter and that's because they have done what man has continued to do since the beginning of time it's ma and will see god move through something or someone instead of turning to the almighty god they begin to worship the instrument god used who do the protestants say the church is built upon they say that the church is built upon jesus the man the embodied mint that came there in the streets of jerusalem and on israel and walk those streets but that's not even it what is the church built upon the revelation of who christ is it's his very spirit revealed to you god himself jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever revealed to you personally that's what happened to peter that revelation of who christ was is what he could found himself on and anchor himself to no matter what he went through that was something he could reach back to as an anchor even after that when he went through the times in his life where he even denied christ yet at the end of the day he could reach back to that anchor of a revelation of who jesus was what kind of kingdom was jesus going to build you know the disciples all believed you know that he the messiah was coming back to overthrow the romans and raise up a kingdom there in jerusalem a physical kingdom but christ let them know he said no that has nothing to do with it it's not flesh and blood but it's a spiritual kingdom what two books in the bible does satan hate more than any others it's genesis and revelations and brother and said the reason why he hates him so much is because genesis shows where he came from and revelation shows him right where he's going does satan hate the most revelation he doesn't hate the written word he doesn't hate if you go to church he doesn't hate if you're religious in fact he really enjoys if you're a really good religious person that's perfect for him as long as you never catch a revelation of what it is you're claiming to believe right on the cusp is a nice he loves it when you hang out right there but don't go any further who gives us revelation the holy spirit it's not some man it's not a minister it's not a pastor it's not a prophet that gives you revelation they bring you the word of god but only the holy spirit himself that one who can come and teach you all things can give you an actual revelation of the word what is the consummation of the scriptures the book of revelations the book of revelations as you begin to dig into it and begin to dig into these church ages you find out the book of revelations takes you all the way from the beginning of time to the end of time where is the book of revelations correctly placed at the end it's the canon of scripture where did the lord jesus come he came at the fullness of time what time are we in right now we're in the laodicean church age the very last one at the end of time why were the seven churches picked in particular those seven churches in asia they were picked for their specific characteristics and how those characteristics would then apply to the church ages and their complacencies in time what is the gross air today that there are three gods what caused a two-way split at the nia council here at the united state council what were they doing they were trying to merge both church and state and bring them together as one unit to control the people because the the state had realized that if we can control the people's religion we can control the people and that's what they were looking to do but what caused the two-way split a nice sea was the doctrine of the godhead because the true church would not buy into a diluted gospel who did jesus claim was his father it was god himself what was the trinity doctrine based on it's it was based on three persons but one god how did the great jehovah appear to israel by a pillar of fire you see and this is why we want you to go back into the history because if he's the same yesterday today and forever and you go and you begin digging through church history and the history of the scriptures and you see god revealing himself to his people then you can start looking for him in the same way but if you don't know or understand how he's come before you won't know what to look for where does john say jesus is he's in the bosom of the father what is the one human name of god it's jesus from which city did philip come and these are all questions that are just tied right into the small portion of the church age book that we've already gone over in our sunday school lessons he came from beseda and what did philip tell nathanael to do it's the same call that we put out to everyone yet today is when philip went to nathanael he didn't try and work anything up he didn't try and you know convince him in any way he just said come and see i'm not trying to convince you of anything but just come and see for yourself that's all we ask just come and see what did jesus say when he saw nathanael coming to him jesus looked out and he said behold an israelite in whom there is no guile you see that was god himself discerning the heart of the believer as he as he came on hadn't ever seen or met him in any other way and yet that's the example that we saw in the ministry of a prophet in this day and age which is the discerning of the heart which allows us to see where we're at in history what did jesus say to the woman at the well he just asked her for a drink something real simple the task that she was already performing he just began to engage her in her everyday life who did the jews have no dealings with in that day it was the samaritans they had huge racial differences back then as has gone on throughout all of history and so it was extremely unusual for a jewish man to be there in samaria and talking to a samaritan let alone a samaritan woman and a samaritan woman that was a known harlot everything had warning bells going off everywhere everything was wrong about it for that time in that age and yet jesus did it anyway how will the true worshiper worship the father in spirit and in truth you know that's kind of where they step through that and i think i'm running really slow here but jesus didn't try and convince her to come to the temple in jerusalem he didn't try and convince her that the the jewish way was better but he simply brought her back to the father he said one day will come when the true worshiper will worship not in jerusalem not on this mountain where we're at not in some holy place but the true worshiper will worship directly with the father what did jesus say after the woman at the well said i know that the messiah cometh i am i am he he identified himself what is he the lamb doing now he is pleading his blood for our sins what will that lamb become one day he'll become lion he'll become the king where is the believer's citizenship it's in heaven it's not on earth it's not in any one country it's in heaven what is our dominion over right now as kings and priests you have dominion over sin god is not known intellectually how is he known spiritually you can't know him with your mind you can't know him with knowledge how much you can memorize you have to know him by revelation what did jesus say a man will do if he loves the lord jesus you'll keep his words who is the jehovah of the old testament he is jesus of the now the same one the same yesterday today and forever he's never changing what does it take to make you realize that the jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new a revelation by the holy spirit you see no matter how simple it may look or seem if it's not revealed to you it will never become real on what do you actually on what do you not actually need a revelation and this may seem like a little bit of a trick question but the answer is water baptism brother branham said you don't need a revelation for water baptism all you need to be able to do is read now satan has clouded your mind and you've come believed something different then it'll take a revelation to change that but all you have to do is be able to read through the scripture to understand water baptism the apostles knew the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost what was that name the lord jesus christ because we know the father is not a name son is not a name holy ghost is not a name these are all titles but the name is the lord jesus christ what book in the bible tells you that the church is in action it's the book of acts and brother iran made a statement in the message he said if history went on long enough if there was not an end to time there would be another book of acts written of this last day church when must a person be baptized over again if not baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ what did the folk of ephesus at the church of ephesus need to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus when will god fill you with his spirit after you have been baptized now we actually there is instances where god brother branham says you stick with the word god can do what he wants because we know in the case of cornelius they were filled with the holy ghost when peter spoke to them and then they were baptized so god can do what he wants but if you're putting out a teaching then you stick with how the apostles and how christ taught it but god can baptize someone with the holy ghost in the womb that was john john the baptist before he was ever born so god can do exactly as he wants to those who are yielded you see cornelius and the group there were so yielded so hungry that they came under that same inspiration they came under that same anointing as the disciples had in the upper room and right there the holy spirit fell but the key to that was that when baptism was offered they went straight to the water no hesitation when did the truth of correct baptism return in this last age it took a profit to come back and sort out all the loose ends of the churches the the doctrines that had been mixed up to the dark ages and with man's denominational ideas and bring us back to the truth when did the prophet say it would be light right at the evening time what must you do if revelation is beyond you look up and seek god for it if you don't understand something and you can't quite get it don't give up just just start praying that's what all god has asked is that you would ask for revelation he wants to give you revelation more than you even desire it he's just waiting for you to ask if you'll ask he'll pour it out in such abundance you won't know what to do with it how do we become the righteousness of god through a union with jesus christ through union of jesus christ he takes on your unrighteousness and when he takes your unrighteousness from you you become his righteousness what did jesus become for us he became sin for us that you might become his righteousness what language did jesus and the people of his day use now in the book it says they used aramaic but something that always strikes me in scripture is it says that he spoke the same common language the same he spoke the same as the common people that's why he was easily understood by them he wasn't trying to use some highly educated verbiage or lingo to explain himself but just a simple common language is how he spoke to the people so not only did he use the same language and tongue but if you would he used the street language to communicate with the people on the street and that's how they understood what he was saying they understood the parables what does the word wash mean when it says washed us from our sins to be washed from your sins is to be loosed from them it should be released from them they have no more connection to you it's like using soap soap binds to the dirt so that it will be released from whatever is being washed and then the water washes it away it can no longer bind to the garment that it was attached to because the soap encapsulates it and removes it and so does the word for us is the word comes in and washes us and removes the sin from our lives in a way that it can never be reattached that's why it goes into the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered again whose blood loosed us completely of our sins his own blood not the blood of a man god's own blood shed for us when the news came to glory that the son adam had been lost who did god send down to earth god didn't send anybody god came down himself to rescue a son and so he does yet today for each individual son and daughter of god god himself will come down to you and meet you where you are to rescue you from where you're at how are we saved by the blood of god what did he become to shed his blood and enter into the veil with it he became the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world when will we we be kings upon the earth with him when he sits upon his throne what kind of kings are we now we are spiritually kings and priests with him now ruling and reigning where are we now seated we're seated in heavenly places with christ jesus revelations 1 7 says he come he is coming with something what is he coming with he's coming with clouds and what kind of clouds clouds of glory when did zechariah prophesy his coming more than 2500 years ago when is the gospel returning to the jews when the gentile day of the gentiles is finished so as when the jews rejected christ it moved over to the gentile so when the gentiles have rejected christ it'll go back to the jews who are the two witnesses that turned the gospel back to the jews moses and elijah who brought the message to the gentiles originally the apostle paul what church does not go through the tribulation the church of the firstborn the bride of christ where did jesus say he got his wounds in the house of my friends who else will be weeping and wailing at this time the sleeping virgin what does oil represent that the foolish virgin refused to get the holy spirit and without the holy spirit there's no revelation why was joseph sent before his brothers to preserve life when was joe joseph hated by his brethren when he was very young why was j why was joseph hated by his brethren because he was spiritual who was joseph the beloved of his father how did the sons of jacob treat joseph they sold him as a slave their very own brother they sold him into slavery what did they do with his coat of many colors they dipped it in blood to deceive his father what brought him into the attention of pharaoh it was his ability as a prophet how only could someone approach pharaoh through joseph where do we see joseph as a perfect type of christ he was hated by his brothers but loved by the father whose dreams did joseph interpret in prison it was pharaoh's butler and his baker who was restored to life the butler or the baker it was the butler and the reason he was restored to life and god used him to testify to pharaoh at the right time of joseph in a time of need but you know that joseph actually sat in prison for an extended period of time after the butler was released you know sometimes that happens to us you know you'll testify to someone you'll do something that you think will benefit you in some way and then the person walks away or that situation walks away from you and you're like well what was the point of that i'm still sitting here in this situation in fact it seems to be getting worse not better but it's god's timing not ours god has his perfect timing for everything and sometimes we look at things we're like it's getting worse i thought i testified to that person i prayed about this and the situation's getting worse and worse and i keep praying what's the point of you from praying and you know i testify to this person over here and their actions get worse not better they're they're more rebellious they're they're [Music] they're against the message they're against the word they're against christianity and and we get frustrated but it's all in god's time he puts you in a certain place at a certain time to plant a seed maybe or to water the seed a little bit and then when the plant doesn't pop up overnight we we get frustrated but in god's time god will bring it to pass stop trying to bring it to pass yourself god has his time was on either side of christ on the cross thieves where did jesus go when he was taken off the cross he was exalted into heaven to the right hand of god who was the one mediator between god and man jesus christ what happened to everything that joseph did in egypt it prospered everything he put his hand to it prospered when he was sold to potiphar everything of potiphar's prospered when he was thrown into prison the prison became a better place to be when he moved into pharaoh's halls and palace all of egypt prospered what will happen to the desert when jesus returns it'll blossom like a rose what is there in the lord's presence fullness of joy what is on his right hand pleasures forevermore what did they do to announce joseph's arrival they sounded a trumpet what did the people do when they heard that trumpet sound they all had to bow the knee didn't matter what they were doing what how important they were when the trumpet was sounded for joseph's arrival they had to bow the knee when shall every knee bow when the trumpet of god shall sound [Music] what kind of bride was joseph given a gentile bride what were the names of joseph's two sons ephraim and manassas what did jacob do when he was about to bless joseph's two sons he crossed his hands who crossed jacob's hands when he was blessing joseph's two sons god himself how did the gentiles receive the blessing of abraham through the cross you see this is where dig back into the scripture and see the types all throughout the old testament all throughout leading up to to christ [Music] and you'll see god repeating himself over and over again he said that not even a fool what error which of joseph's brothers were missing when they appeared before him it was benjamin and what set joseph's soul on fire it was also benjamin who does little benjamin typify 144 000 that jewish church at the end of time where will the gentile church go in the rapture to meet the lord in the air even as the gentile joseph gentile bride when he revealed himself to his brethren was removed to the palace where will the bride be when the retributive wrath of god is poured out at the marriage supper why did the jews reject jesus it was god's only way he could bring a gentile bride how long will a honeymoon be for the bride and his and her attendance upon the earth a thousand years the millennium how did the first gentile age go out a message in tongues on the wall how will this age go out in the same way what is the further proof that the times of the gentiles are over an abundance of tongues who is the one and only true god the lord jesus christ saints these are just questions to stir up your pure minds not so much to trick you or catch you out or be hard to find you could answer it by a word search but that's not so much what we're wanting you to do go back into the scripture go back into the message dig through it find the truth see how you fit in and where you're at where we're all at in history and where we're going thank you so much [Music] you
