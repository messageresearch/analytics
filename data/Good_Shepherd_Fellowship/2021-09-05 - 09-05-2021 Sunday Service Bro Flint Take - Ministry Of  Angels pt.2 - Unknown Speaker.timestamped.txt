[48:08] brother scott
[48:10] everybody for inviting us
[48:12] uh
[48:14] told brother juan when he's calling me
[48:15] he said well we might do a
[48:17] a couple's banquet and this and that and
[48:19] i said brother i said i'm just glad i'm
[48:22] coming
[48:23] i said don't
[48:24] don't worry i'll
[48:26] i'll preach once i'll preach 10 times i
[48:28] don't care whatever you want me to do
[48:30] but we just want to be here and we so
[48:32] enjoyed that couples meeting last night

[48:37] next time he does one
[48:38] whether i'm the preacher or not i should
[48:40] be here
[48:41] bring my wife come on down and and try
[48:43] to encourage my daughter me and then
[48:45] brother scott said my son that'd be
[48:47] awesome a little revival family revival
[48:49] in in
[48:52] minnesota
[48:54] praise the lord
[48:56] anyway we just appreciate everybody
[48:57] thanks for the hospitality and we're
[48:59] glad to be here
[49:01] this morning if we could before we get
[49:03] started i'd like to i have a video that
[49:05] i want everybody to watch
[49:07] and um
[49:08] so brother jordan if you could
[49:11] go ahead and play that it's just a
[49:12] little video to check your uh
[49:15] you know
[49:17] i'm not sure what the word would be
[49:18] called but
[49:19] your attention span maybe to pay
[49:21] attention and
[49:23] they want you to count how many
[49:24] basketballs are tossed and it says right
[49:26] here okay here we go count how many
[49:27] times the players wearing white past the
[49:29] ball
[49:33] how many times the players wearing white
[49:35] pass the ball pay attention
[50:01] don't say anything just watch
[50:04] count
[50:09] the correct answer is 16 passes
[50:14] did you spot the gorilla
[50:17] for people who haven't seen or heard
[50:19] about a video like this before about
[50:22] half missed the gorilla
[50:26] if you knew about the gorilla you
[50:27] probably saw it but did you notice the
[50:30] curtain changing color or the player on
[50:31] the black team leaving the game
[50:36] let's rewind and watch it again
[50:40] [Music]
[50:40] [Applause]
[50:43] here comes the gorilla and there goes a
[50:45] player and the curtain is changing from
[50:47] red to gold
[50:54] when you're looking for a gorilla you
[50:56] often miss other unexpected events hey
[50:58] man you can stop it there
[51:01] the monkey business illusion yeah that's
[51:02] the monkey business illusion how many
[51:05] didn't even see the gorilla
[51:08] several people did not see the girl the
[51:10] first time i watched this i did not see
[51:11] the gorilla i was so focused on counting
[51:14] that ball yeah amen how many saw the
[51:17] curtain change colors
[51:20] just a few and then how many also saw
[51:22] the player with the black shirt leave
[51:25] amen well praise god
[51:28] so you can see that's a good little
[51:30] example of perception
[51:33] we don't always
[51:34] see what we think we're seeing
[51:36] or we don't always get all the
[51:38] information
[51:39] that we think we're getting amen
[51:42] when the police the police know that so
[51:44] when they investigate an accident scene
[51:45] many times there could be five
[51:46] eyewitnesses eyewitnesses
[51:49] and they all have a different story
[51:51] and so they have to learn how to try to
[51:52] put all this together because it's just
[51:55] that we don't always see everything that
[51:57] we're looking at
[51:58] is that interesting
[52:00] yeah especially in relationships right
[52:02] many times we
[52:03] perceive something the wrong way and
[52:05] it's a big deal
[52:06] so we don't always
[52:08] uh
[52:10] see what we're looking at or
[52:13] or see it all
[52:14] so i have a couple of pictures i'd like
[52:16] to bring
[52:17] one of the pictures up here if we could
[52:19] the first one on the light spectrum
[52:26] okay here's the light spectrum
[52:29] now i'm not a scientist and i don't know
[52:30] a whole lot about it there's probably
[52:32] people here that know so much about it
[52:34] that i don't know
[52:35] but what i do know is that
[52:37] in the light spectrum all these things
[52:40] are there gamma rays x-rays ultraviolet
[52:43] rays infrared rays radar fm tv
[52:47] shortwave am
[52:49] so there are all these things within the
[52:51] light spectrum
[52:54] but we are limited
[52:55] by our sight to only see visible light
[52:59] and that is this little area of the
[53:01] entire light spectrum the light spectrum
[53:03] is this huge
[53:04] we see this much
[53:07] so because we live in a atmosphere
[53:10] excuse me in a dimension the third
[53:11] dimension light time and matter so we've
[53:14] been limited amen that's why the
[53:16] scripture says when jesus when god came
[53:18] down he came down a little bit below the
[53:21] angels
[53:22] so he dropped down out of a higher
[53:24] dimension and he walked inside of jesus
[53:26] the man
[53:27] amen became god elohim was in this man
[53:31] he condescended down below
[53:33] the angels and became in the flesh man
[53:36] amen
[53:37] so we are limited
[53:39] by light time and matter our eyesight
[53:41] our as brother branham said we had five
[53:43] uh inlets to contact our earthly home
[53:46] with feel taste smell hear and and
[53:48] whatnot
[53:50] and so
[53:51] uh all we can see
[53:53] within the entire spectrum you can't see
[53:56] tv coming through here right
[53:58] although brother brown picked it up and
[53:59] he told us a long time ago he said but
[54:00] there is tv there are movies going
[54:02] through here in another realm we just
[54:04] can't see them right
[54:06] so then if we can't see all that stuff
[54:08] we that means when the angels many times
[54:09] they're here we don't see them
[54:11] is that right
[54:13] so
[54:14] now
[54:14] this is the interesting thing
[54:16] that i think is interesting is out of
[54:18] the lights out of the light spectrum
[54:20] that we see
[54:22] what we would call visible light we see
[54:25] the rainbow colors
[54:26] the seven colors now can we go to the
[54:28] next slide please or a
[54:31] picture
[54:33] so there's the prism
[54:35] a three-sided prism anytime light goes
[54:38] through a three-sided prism
[54:40] or like when it rains
[54:42] it refracts light
[54:44] and when it refracts light what happens
[54:46] is a rainbow takes place
[54:48] right
[54:50] so when light is coming in and light
[54:53] what we call light this is light but
[54:55] it's actually light is actually derived
[54:57] from three colors
[54:59] cyan magenta and yellow
[55:02] so it takes these three colors to make
[55:04] light
[55:05] are you with me so when light
[55:08] refracts through a prism out comes seven
[55:11] colors
[55:12] praise the lord
[55:14] so we know that brother branham told us
[55:16] that god is perfected in a triune being
[55:19] not a trinity like they teach but a
[55:20] triune being
[55:22] father son and holy ghost
[55:24] so all three father son and holy ghost
[55:27] they meant together
[55:29] make one light
[55:31] amen not three different beings but you
[55:33] understand
[55:34] the office of father son and holy ghost
[55:36] god is the only complete father son of
[55:37] the holy ghost in the office
[55:39] so when the light is refracted out comes
[55:42] seven colors
[55:44] amen
[55:45] and that's why the bible says the seven
[55:47] spirits of god the seven seers of god
[55:50] so now within the within the light
[55:52] spectrum we have seven ages and we have
[55:54] seven messengers and the seven
[55:56] messengers amen were what
[55:58] they were eyes
[56:00] they were eyes that could see
[56:02] amen so god gave the earth gave the the
[56:05] the church
[56:06] eyes throughout each age
[56:08] a a a gift where they could see light
[56:13] amen now you're hearing me okay praise
[56:16] the lord
[56:17] that's we're done with that now if we
[56:19] could perhaps we'll stand this morning
[56:20] and read a couple scriptures
[56:31] ephesians
[56:36] uh let's take ephesians chapter one
[56:42] yesterday i for our friday night i
[56:44] forgot my bible and i used this big
[56:46] print bible
[56:48] so this morning i purposely left my
[56:50] bible behind
[56:52] i like this bible
[56:55] ephesians one i want to put one on my
[56:57] pulpit back home
[56:59] verse 3
[57:02] blessed be the god and father of our
[57:05] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[57:07] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[57:10] places in christ that's our position in
[57:13] christ in heavenly places amen
[57:16] zachariah chapter four
[57:19] we'll just take a quick
[57:23] uh reading
[57:24] there
[57:33] verse one
[57:36] and the angel that talked with me came
[57:38] again and waked me as a man that
[57:41] is awakened out of his sleep and said
[57:42] unto me
[57:43] what see us thou so now
[57:46] hear god
[57:47] the angel of the lord is speaking
[57:49] to this man zachariah
[57:52] let's pray heavenly father we pray that
[57:53] you'd add the blessing to your reading
[57:55] of your word we pray lord god that you
[57:57] administer every heart father many were
[57:59] up late last night but father help them
[58:01] lord to be able to receive this morning
[58:04] lord god we don't want anything holding
[58:05] us back from hearing what the spirit
[58:07] saith to our hearts lord god that you
[58:09] might have that on way and speak this
[58:11] morning we pray in jesus christ's name
[58:13] amen god bless you may be seated
[58:15] so here this
[58:18] the the spirit of the lord is now
[58:19] speaking
[58:20] to this prophet he says what see us thou
[58:24] so now god knows that we are limited to
[58:27] in our eyesight he knows that we can
[58:29] only see in a third dimension
[58:31] but now he also knows how to get
[58:33] attention of a prophet and to show them
[58:35] something and the prophet what a prophet
[58:37] is a seer
[58:39] they have eyes they can see
[58:41] and so now he says what see us down and
[58:44] i said i have looked and behold a
[58:45] candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[58:48] the top of it so god is showing him a
[58:50] vision
[58:51] and his seven lamps
[58:53] thereon and seven pipes to the seven
[58:55] lamps which are upon the top thereof
[58:58] and two olive trees by it one upon the
[59:00] right side of the bowl
[59:02] and the other upon the left side thereof
[59:03] so i answered and i speak to the angel
[59:05] that talked with me saying what are
[59:06] these my lord then the angel that talked
[59:09] with me answered and said unto me
[59:11] knoweth thou not what these be
[59:13] and i said no my lord
[59:15] then he answered and spake unto me
[59:17] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[59:19] zero zer
[59:20] i don't really know how to say the word
[59:22] jerubal
[59:23] saying not by might not by nor by power
[59:26] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[59:28] who art thou o great mountain before
[59:31] zerubbabel
[59:33] thou shalt become a plain and he shall
[59:35] bring
[59:36] forth the headstone there of with
[59:38] shouting's crying grace unto it grace
[59:41] grace unto it
[59:42] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[59:44] me saying the hands of zerubbabel
[59:46] have laid the foundation of this house
[59:48] his hands shall also finish it and thou
[59:50] shalt know that the lord of hosts had
[59:52] sent me unto you
[59:54] for who hath despised the day of small
[59:56] things now brother brown preaches the
[59:58] message uh god in simplicity
[1:00:01] and he brings this out that this is our
[1:00:03] god operating in in small things and
[1:00:05] through simplicity but doing mighty
[1:00:07] works he said for they shall rejoice and
[1:00:10] shall say the plummet
[1:00:11] in the hand of zerubbabel
[1:00:13] with those seven
[1:00:15] they are the eyes of the lord which run
[1:00:18] to and fro through the whole earth
[1:00:21] and we can pick that up in revelations
[1:00:22] chapter one as well but we won't turn
[1:00:24] with me to second kings
[1:00:27] chapter six
[1:00:36] second kings and chapter six
[1:00:47] in verse 15
[1:00:54] and when the servant of the man of god
[1:00:56] was risen early and gone forth
[1:01:01] beholden hosts can pass the city both
[1:01:03] with horses and chariots and his servant
[1:01:05] said unto him i'll ask my master how
[1:01:08] shall we do
[1:01:10] and he answered fear not for they that
[1:01:12] be with us are more than they that be
[1:01:14] with them
[1:01:15] and elisha prayed and said lord i pray
[1:01:19] thee
[1:01:19] open his eyes
[1:01:21] that he may see
[1:01:22] and the lord opened the eyes of the
[1:01:24] young man
[1:01:26] and he saw now remember now there's a
[1:01:28] seer standing there
[1:01:30] a prophet a seer
[1:01:31] he sees the host of heaven
[1:01:34] the young man is standing there who's
[1:01:36] limited by light time and matter
[1:01:39] who's limited in his eyesight
[1:01:42] he sees the syrian army but he doesn't
[1:01:44] see the host of heaven
[1:01:46] and behold the mountain was full of
[1:01:48] horses and chariots of fire around about
[1:01:49] elisha
[1:01:51] and when they came down to him elisha
[1:01:53] prayed unto the lord and said smite this
[1:01:55] people i pray thee with blindness and he
[1:01:58] says oh excuse me let's go back to verse
[1:02:00] 17. and elisha prayed and said lord i
[1:02:02] pray thee open his eyes that he may see
[1:02:06] praise the lord and and the lord opened
[1:02:09] the eyes of the young man and he saw and
[1:02:11] behold the mountain was full of horses
[1:02:13] and chariots
[1:02:15] round about elisha
[1:02:17] now i want to speak this morning on the
[1:02:19] ministry of angels again part two
[1:02:23] and uh
[1:02:25] there are several dimensions
[1:02:28] in the light in excuse me that we don't
[1:02:30] see
[1:02:31] we don't see the fourth dimension the
[1:02:32] fifth or sixth seventh dimension
[1:02:35] our eyes are limited to what the like
[1:02:37] spectrum allows us to see
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:41] so by god's grace he has provided amen
[1:02:43] through the church ages he has provided
[1:02:45] seven messengers
[1:02:47] that that could see whose eyes were
[1:02:50] opened and they could see
[1:02:52] the seventh angel the seventh seal he
[1:02:54] was a prophet seer
[1:02:56] amen
[1:02:57] when the top of the pyramid in the
[1:02:58] vision of junior jackson he had a dream
[1:03:00] and the top of the pyramid was cut open
[1:03:01] with a with a crowbar
[1:03:04] and down on the inside there was a white
[1:03:06] rock and he said
[1:03:07] no one has ever seen inside of this rock
[1:03:09] yet
[1:03:10] referring to the revelation of the word
[1:03:12] of god
[1:03:14] and praise the lord
[1:03:15] and brother branham is sent back west to
[1:03:17] come back to get the visitation of seven
[1:03:19] angels to come back in east to preach
[1:03:21] the opening of the seals that we might
[1:03:24] see jesus and his program amen are we
[1:03:26] together
[1:03:28] praise the lord god knows as i was
[1:03:30] saying god knows that we are limited in
[1:03:33] our eyesight
[1:03:34] therefore we are told to walk by faith
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:38] all things are about possible to them
[1:03:40] that can believe we're in a challenge we
[1:03:43] have to believe we have to have faith
[1:03:46] because all this is happening around us
[1:03:48] there's angels in this room but we must
[1:03:51] believe they're here because that's the
[1:03:53] only way most of us will ever see them
[1:03:55] is by our faith
[1:03:57] praise the lord because most of us are
[1:03:59] not prophets although some people see
[1:04:01] angels and some people have seen the
[1:04:03] pillar of fire
[1:04:04] praise the lord
[1:04:08] i have never seen the pillar of fire but
[1:04:11] the interesting thing is is my brother
[1:04:12] who's not a message believer has seen
[1:04:14] the pillar of fire all over me
[1:04:19] so and and and that's that's nothing to
[1:04:22] say about brother flint i'm just a
[1:04:24] brother i'm a believer
[1:04:26] but the pillar of fire is with the
[1:04:28] church
[1:04:29] they have taken pictures not just with
[1:04:31] brother branham but they have pictures
[1:04:32] of the pillar of fire
[1:04:35] amen and i've spoke to brothers
[1:04:37] personally who have seen angels
[1:04:43] excuse me
[1:04:45] so perception now
[1:04:48] so we are limited by sight but we are
[1:04:50] also limited by our perception
[1:04:53] as what we saw in the in the
[1:04:55] illustration of the monkey
[1:04:58] so sometimes we're looking at something
[1:04:59] very plainly and our information that we
[1:05:01] have we believe in a certain thing and
[1:05:04] this is what we're seeing
[1:05:06] but yet there could be something else
[1:05:07] happening we didn't see the monkey we
[1:05:09] didn't see the the curtain change but it
[1:05:12] happened
[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:13] you were all sitting here and some of
[1:05:15] you didn't see those things yet those
[1:05:17] things happen right before your eyes
[1:05:23] interesting
[1:05:25] yes
[1:05:28] and that is why god can come into a
[1:05:30] church setting like this this morning
[1:05:33] and one person can be moved on
[1:05:35] powerfully by the spirit of god the very
[1:05:37] person sitting next to them
[1:05:40] feel nothing see receive nothing and
[1:05:42] nothing happened to them
[1:05:46] because they're not connected properly
[1:05:51] praise the lord
[1:05:53] and if our mind is busy doing other
[1:05:55] things many times we miss and we don't
[1:05:58] recognize
[1:05:59] the unfailing realities of the living
[1:06:01] god one time when i was
[1:06:03] years ago i was troubled about something
[1:06:05] my mind was full of business and driving
[1:06:07] down the road and
[1:06:08] my little children were with us and they
[1:06:10] were worshiping the lord in the back
[1:06:11] seat because me and my three oldest
[1:06:13] children they were in the back seat and
[1:06:15] worshipping the
[1:06:16] lord i was frustrated with business my
[1:06:19] mind was full
[1:06:21] we got home and get out of the car
[1:06:24] my little boy
[1:06:26] gets out i look at him he's just weeping
[1:06:31] weeping probably 10 years old 11
[1:06:33] somewhere in there
[1:06:35] and i look at him and he goes
[1:06:37] oh dad
[1:06:38] wasn't that an amazing presence of the
[1:06:40] lord
[1:06:42] and i thought wow lord
[1:06:44] i didn't feel you
[1:06:46] i didn't sense you
[1:06:48] i didn't know you were there
[1:06:51] god forgive me
[1:06:53] god came into the car
[1:06:55] those three children were anointed by
[1:06:57] the spirit of god
[1:06:59] and i was driving
[1:07:01] and i sensed nothing i felt nothing i
[1:07:03] got nothing and you know that that's
[1:07:05] true because sometimes you come out of a
[1:07:06] service and a brother or a sister will
[1:07:08] be testifying my goodness what a
[1:07:11] powerful move of god and yet in your
[1:07:13] mind you're thinking what kind of a
[1:07:14] message was that
[1:07:18] and one time i one time it was perfect i
[1:07:19] was really tired and and i used to watch
[1:07:22] a lot of lonnie jenkins videos because
[1:07:23] they sent them to me and i i was up one
[1:07:25] night and i was watching a video but i
[1:07:27] was really tired and i was thinking
[1:07:29] while he was preaching or teaching i was
[1:07:30] thinking
[1:07:31] man
[1:07:32] that seemed like he's lost that that
[1:07:35] click there that
[1:07:36] that whatever
[1:07:38] and later on i thought you know what i
[1:07:39] better watch that again because i was
[1:07:40] tired and i watched it again i was on
[1:07:42] the edge of my seat amen oh my goodness
[1:07:44] i was on fire
[1:07:46] what was the difference my perception
[1:07:49] what i was really seeing
[1:07:51] it's all the same it was the same word
[1:07:53] but now there was some spirit there
[1:07:58] and that's why it's so important that we
[1:08:00] come to church expecting we come to
[1:08:02] church the house of god asking god i
[1:08:05] have a need help me
[1:08:08] praise the lord
[1:08:10] years ago i had a couple of we had a
[1:08:12] couple of uh donny reagan tapes that
[1:08:15] that blessed our heart and we were going
[1:08:16] down into idaho and
[1:08:19] down there the church was failing they
[1:08:20] were dying there was just a couple of
[1:08:22] families left and they were struggling
[1:08:24] they're doing very good now
[1:08:27] and it was in my heart i wanted to help
[1:08:29] these people and we went down there and
[1:08:32] i was preaching to them in the living
[1:08:33] room
[1:08:34] and they're sitting in their chairs arms
[1:08:36] like this
[1:08:39] like almost like can you hurry up and
[1:08:40] shut up so we can get back to whatever
[1:08:43] i mean they're just lounging
[1:08:46] and i thought wow
[1:08:48] god help us
[1:08:50] because i know that the gift of god
[1:08:52] belongs to god
[1:08:53] it doesn't belong to me
[1:08:55] but the gift of god is operated by the
[1:08:56] individuals the people
[1:09:00] and then i saw so i thought okay i know
[1:09:02] what we can do and i was praying and i
[1:09:04] said hannah let's get together and we
[1:09:06] got together with my brother-in-law and
[1:09:07] sister-in-law we sat down and we watched
[1:09:10] a video of brother donnie reagan
[1:09:11] preaching and man we got i mean we went
[1:09:14] into glory
[1:09:16] and we had a prayer meeting and i mean
[1:09:18] we just called out to god such an
[1:09:20] anointing such a powerful move of god
[1:09:24] so i thought okay
[1:09:25] so we invited some other brothers from
[1:09:27] the church
[1:09:28] and let's sit down and watch it and and
[1:09:30] this older man he was sitting there
[1:09:32] you know sometimes our age kill us
[1:09:35] because we get to think that we know so
[1:09:36] much
[1:09:40] and sometimes our our reasoning power
[1:09:42] kill our faith
[1:09:46] because we've been around so long
[1:09:50] and so now we play the other tape
[1:09:52] i'm expecting revival
[1:09:54] we had revival tonight before we're
[1:09:56] going to break into final revival we're
[1:09:58] going to get back into church i'm going
[1:10:00] to preach and we're gonna we're gonna go
[1:10:02] into another glory
[1:10:04] and then all of a sudden we're watching
[1:10:05] it and it just no feel there
[1:10:08] man we just couldn't get into the spirit
[1:10:09] of god
[1:10:11] as soon as the tape was over
[1:10:13] the old man's coming
[1:10:15] did you notice that preacher
[1:10:17] his hair never got messed up
[1:10:19] moved his head around all the and i
[1:10:21] thought now i know why
[1:10:23] because he's sitting there in the skeet
[1:10:24] of the in the seat of scoffing he's
[1:10:27] sitting there in the seat of unbelief he
[1:10:30] bringing his unbelief and i was a
[1:10:31] brother
[1:10:33] i'm not putting him out don't get me
[1:10:34] wrong
[1:10:35] he was just in the wrong channel his
[1:10:37] perception was wrong he didn't know what
[1:10:40] he was seeing
[1:10:41] he didn't know what he was hearing
[1:10:44] praise the lord
[1:10:48] so perception is an important thing
[1:10:53] hallelujah
[1:10:56] in the case with elisha and geheza
[1:11:00] both are looking at the syrian army
[1:11:02] but both are seeing two different
[1:11:03] scenarios
[1:11:05] elisha his eyes were open
[1:11:08] and he he could see but gehey's his eyes
[1:11:10] were limited so gahe's perception was
[1:11:13] much different than elijah's perception
[1:11:15] are you hearing me
[1:11:17] that's why the prophet of god we're
[1:11:19] preaching and one time he's preaching
[1:11:20] and all of a sudden he says he stops and
[1:11:22] he says
[1:11:23] the angel of god is here
[1:11:26] he said he's standing right over there
[1:11:27] by that man
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:30] and he says can't you people see him
[1:11:33] it's so plain to him
[1:11:34] there is a man standing there that's the
[1:11:36] angel of god
[1:11:39] and he's like can't you people see him
[1:11:41] he's right there
[1:11:44] and he would come up on the platform and
[1:11:46] stand there by brother branham the angel
[1:11:48] of god
[1:11:49] he would be preaching he said i are
[1:11:50] talking i'm saying i'm waiting for him
[1:11:52] to come then all of a sudden he's here
[1:11:55] how does he know he's there he's
[1:11:57] standing there
[1:11:58] stand up brother juan
[1:12:01] so all of a sudden he's talking i'm
[1:12:02] waiting for him to come now appear the
[1:12:04] angel
[1:12:14] we won't worship this guy he's our
[1:12:16] brother
[1:12:18] so all of a sudden stay here all of a
[1:12:20] sudden here is the angel
[1:12:25] the people don't see him
[1:12:29] but he's there
[1:12:32] and now somebody come up
[1:12:35] brother jesus your turn come on up
[1:12:38] we might as well put him in the hot
[1:12:39] water too
[1:12:40] he's going to sneak off to the
[1:12:42] philippines
[1:12:44] we'll pray he'd come back to minnesota
[1:12:46] come over here brother
[1:12:49] now he's the one that come up
[1:12:51] and
[1:12:52] i'm brother brown
[1:12:55] i get the good job
[1:12:57] well he's the angel that's even a better
[1:12:59] job
[1:13:00] and this is the brother with the
[1:13:01] infirmity
[1:13:03] or the need
[1:13:05] just like most of us sitting here we
[1:13:06] have a need
[1:13:10] but now this man came to church because
[1:13:12] he wants god to meet him he wants god to
[1:13:16] deliver him to help him to heal him
[1:13:19] whatever
[1:13:21] he knows that jesus christ is the same
[1:13:23] yesterday today and forever and that god
[1:13:24] keeps his promises and that he's not a
[1:13:26] man that he could lie
[1:13:30] amen so he put his name he got a prayer
[1:13:32] card and now he's standing before the
[1:13:33] prophet
[1:13:36] now the prophet don't know the man
[1:13:43] but now all of a sudden something
[1:13:44] happens because he's a seer with the
[1:13:46] gift in his life that god put there
[1:13:49] now all of a sudden he starts to see
[1:13:52] the angel's standing right there
[1:13:54] watching over everything the presence is
[1:13:56] super strong
[1:13:58] the patient that comes first usually
[1:13:59] scared to death he said don't fear he
[1:14:01] won't hurt you
[1:14:03] he can't see him
[1:14:05] but now all of a sudden he feels him but
[1:14:07] now all of a sudden
[1:14:09] there starts to it he feels him if he is
[1:14:11] a believer
[1:14:14] the doubter
[1:14:16] they're the one that come forward to try
[1:14:18] to challenge
[1:14:19] they feel nothing
[1:14:21] so they stand there bold
[1:14:23] not even knowing they're in the presence
[1:14:24] of god
[1:14:26] and now here he is standing here
[1:14:29] and now our discernment starts to come
[1:14:30] your name is jesus is your name jesus i
[1:14:33] got that part right
[1:14:37] but i got to ask him where you're from
[1:14:40] he's going to the philippines
[1:14:42] i don't know
[1:14:44] and brother branham didn't know
[1:14:47] and then brother venom would out of his
[1:14:49] voice he would discern the thoughts and
[1:14:51] intents of the heart the faith would
[1:14:52] rise up
[1:14:54] and the man could take his healing god
[1:14:56] bless you brothers thank you
[1:15:01] [Applause]
[1:15:02] but then brother venom would say
[1:15:05] i don't know what did he tell you
[1:15:07] whatever he told you you better listen
[1:15:09] to it
[1:15:11] he'll go back to tape and he'll listen
[1:15:12] to it again what did i say
[1:15:15] here's a man that would have to go
[1:15:17] listen to his tapes many times to even
[1:15:18] know what he preached
[1:15:24] even though the people couldn't see it
[1:15:26] but prophets our seers and seers can see
[1:15:29] many things
[1:15:30] so they're not limited to the light
[1:15:32] spectrum so what i always say is
[1:15:34] prophets
[1:15:35] walk by sight
[1:15:36] faith they come in their in their room
[1:15:39] and all of a sudden there's the angel of
[1:15:40] the lord
[1:15:43] they see him he's a man brother adam was
[1:15:46] there he was praying
[1:15:47] he said and all of a sudden he heard
[1:15:53] a man walking into the room
[1:15:57] and then
[1:15:59] all of a sudden appear an angel
[1:16:02] a man
[1:16:03] a messenger
[1:16:04] an angelic being the angel of the lord
[1:16:07] and i said you have been sent you have
[1:16:09] got a gift and you're obese and god's
[1:16:10] going to use this gift in a mighty way
[1:16:12] are you following me
[1:16:15] so prophets are seers
[1:16:17] jeremiah what do you see i see a
[1:16:19] cauldron it's fell into the north you
[1:16:20] have seen good
[1:16:22] there will be an army rise out of the
[1:16:24] north
[1:16:25] amen so they're given a sight
[1:16:28] that the rest of the body doesn't
[1:16:30] necessarily possess
[1:16:32] amen some might have some of that but do
[1:16:34] you understand amen
[1:16:38] because i think it's foolish that some
[1:16:39] message people think that people can't
[1:16:40] have discernment it's a gift of god
[1:16:43] other people can have this sermon but
[1:16:45] not that kind of discernment not that
[1:16:46] kind of gift not that kind of seeing
[1:16:48] that's a prophet of god that's a major
[1:16:49] word prophet that's very much different
[1:16:51] than any other gift
[1:16:52] [Applause]
[1:16:54] because that's one of the ones when this
[1:16:55] light spectrum breaks through the prism
[1:16:58] of father son and holy ghost and now
[1:17:00] there are seven spirits of god that are
[1:17:02] seven seers one for every church age
[1:17:07] praise the lord
[1:17:10] so now the bible encourages us because
[1:17:12] we are limited
[1:17:18] sometimes we're like hey so all we can
[1:17:19] see
[1:17:20] is our trials
[1:17:22] our fear
[1:17:24] our trouble
[1:17:26] our circumstance
[1:17:28] our defeat
[1:17:29] it's all we can see
[1:17:32] and we think because of the third
[1:17:35] dimension and the reasoning power of our
[1:17:36] mind
[1:17:37] we think that that's reality
[1:17:41] but that wasn't
[1:17:42] reality that was gahe's reality until
[1:17:46] elijah said open the boy's eyes
[1:17:49] and that's why the message of the hour
[1:17:51] is so important to us because it's just
[1:17:54] like elijah speaking open their eyes
[1:17:56] lord open their eyes lord
[1:17:59] praise the lord
[1:18:02] so the bible encourages us to look
[1:18:04] through the eyes of faith to unlock the
[1:18:06] realities of the living god
[1:18:09] amen the trial is only the opportunity
[1:18:12] presented to the child of god to
[1:18:13] overcome to receive a testimony
[1:18:16] praise god amen
[1:18:18] hallelujah
[1:18:20] so we are looking at the unseen we're
[1:18:22] looking at the host of heaven encounter
[1:18:24] around us god help us to see the unseen
[1:18:29] brother brown says from the message
[1:18:30] questions and answers
[1:18:32] see now it's promised that sinners has
[1:18:34] angel excuse me now it isn't promised
[1:18:37] that sinners has angels
[1:18:40] it's only the redeemed has angels
[1:18:44] so if you're a sinner this morning or
[1:18:47] encourage you
[1:18:49] to get your life right with the lord
[1:18:52] and he goes on he says the angels of the
[1:18:54] lord and camp about those that fear him
[1:18:57] now we know that that means they put
[1:18:58] tents down they encamp they're here
[1:19:00] they're always with you brother scott 24
[1:19:03] 7. there are angels around every
[1:19:05] believer on the entire earth
[1:19:08] and they don't just they don't just move
[1:19:10] around they camp down there with you
[1:19:15] praise the lord
[1:19:16] angelic beings protecting us and
[1:19:19] guarding the children of god
[1:19:21] amen the bible says your angel always be
[1:19:24] holding the face of the father in heaven
[1:19:28] from the message here ye him
[1:19:31] now lord realizing that standing near
[1:19:33] there's perhaps many many angels because
[1:19:36] there's believers here and the bible
[1:19:37] says the angels of god are encamped
[1:19:40] they're not going back and forth but
[1:19:41] they're camped encamped
[1:19:44] about those who fear him many more are
[1:19:46] being called from glory tonight to
[1:19:47] encamp around those who've raised their
[1:19:49] hand to teach them the way of life how
[1:19:52] they should live
[1:19:55] so the question is
[1:19:57] what is your perception this morning
[1:19:59] are you limited to these four walls
[1:20:02] these lights
[1:20:04] this guy up in the front screaming at
[1:20:05] you with a beard
[1:20:08] or is there something by a sixth sense
[1:20:11] that's letting making you aware
[1:20:15] by your faith
[1:20:16] that's right the scriptures is true
[1:20:19] there are angels in this room
[1:20:21] that's exactly right i might not see
[1:20:24] them lord but i know they're here
[1:20:29] hallelujah
[1:20:33] they might be in another dimension but
[1:20:34] they're here
[1:20:36] i say we should just pause for a minute
[1:20:38] and let's ask the lord
[1:20:41] lord
[1:20:42] open my eyes
[1:20:44] open my eyes
[1:20:46] not so much my sight eyes although i
[1:20:48] would love to see angels
[1:20:51] but open my faith eyes
[1:20:54] and my walk is by faith
[1:20:57] your walk is by faith
[1:20:59] brother brown said in one place he said
[1:21:01] do you realize you have more faith than
[1:21:02] i do
[1:21:04] he said i see the angel you don't
[1:21:07] so you have to believe
[1:21:10] and we know that that other realm
[1:21:12] operates only on belief
[1:21:15] what you believe
[1:21:17] but here's the nice thing
[1:21:19] all things are possible
[1:21:23] all things are possible to them that
[1:21:27] believe
[1:21:28] to them that believe
[1:21:31] all things are possible
[1:21:34] hallelujah
[1:21:36] you believe that this morning
[1:21:40] praise the lord
[1:21:44] so
[1:21:45] god help our unbelief
[1:21:48] amen
[1:21:50] this morning we're knocking on father's
[1:21:52] door
[1:21:54] if you come to church you've got a need
[1:21:56] if you come to church expecting nothing
[1:21:58] right now i'm telling you and you have a
[1:22:00] need
[1:22:01] start knocking on heaven's door
[1:22:04] amen we're in the third dimension
[1:22:07] amen but heaven is here
[1:22:09] it's just in a higher faster dimension
[1:22:11] god is here
[1:22:13] the angels are here amen amen
[1:22:16] do you hear me
[1:22:18] god is here the angels are here all
[1:22:20] things are possible so then that can
[1:22:22] believe
[1:22:24] praise the lord we are standing on holy
[1:22:26] ground
[1:22:28] now what's your perception this morning
[1:22:30] what are you thinking
[1:22:32] so isaiah now
[1:22:34] isaiah was a prophet of god and he had a
[1:22:36] buddy named uzziah and uzziah was the
[1:22:38] king
[1:22:39] and uziah you know their buddies and so
[1:22:41] the king always helped take care of you
[1:22:43] isaiah everything going pretty smooth
[1:22:46] but then when i when uzziah passed away
[1:22:49] all of a sudden isaiah realized
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:53] because something's going to happen to
[1:22:55] isaiah
[1:22:56] let me read it in the year that king
[1:22:58] uzziah died
[1:23:00] i saw also the lord sitting upon a
[1:23:01] throne high and lifted up and his train
[1:23:04] filled the temple
[1:23:07] so isaiah breaks into a vision
[1:23:10] above that stood the seraphims each one
[1:23:12] had six wings between he covered his
[1:23:13] face and with twain he covered his feet
[1:23:15] and with twain he did fly
[1:23:18] so isaac isaiah is there
[1:23:21] his friend uzziah died just bring a
[1:23:23] situation into his life
[1:23:25] and he's praying
[1:23:27] and brother ellis said he start to
[1:23:29] realize he'd been using his gift wrong
[1:23:32] and while he's praying he breaks into a
[1:23:35] vision
[1:23:37] now he goes somewhere
[1:23:39] where does he go
[1:23:41] all of a sudden he's in the throne room
[1:23:44] and he sees by vision
[1:23:47] i lost my
[1:23:48] excuse me saints
[1:23:51] he sees by vision
[1:23:55] he breaks into this vision and he sees
[1:23:57] the throne he sees god high and lifted
[1:24:00] up he sees his train filling the temple
[1:24:03] he sees angels flying all over seraphims
[1:24:08] but where did he go
[1:24:12] brother said if you dream
[1:24:14] you go somewhere
[1:24:17] he said you go into the re in the end
[1:24:19] you go into your subconscious
[1:24:22] hello
[1:24:24] so isaiah was right he didn't go
[1:24:26] physically anywhere
[1:24:30] he was probably maybe in a common spot
[1:24:32] that he prayed at a lot
[1:24:35] but now he he moved by vision into
[1:24:39] another realm where he could see beyond
[1:24:42] life time and matter he could see beyond
[1:24:45] the light spectrum
[1:24:48] now what is he looking at he is looking
[1:24:50] at reality
[1:24:54] this is not reality
[1:24:58] what you're seeing with your eyes is not
[1:25:00] reality
[1:25:01] but what you're seeing with your faith
[1:25:03] eyes your sick sense that is reality
[1:25:10] so many times when people are struggling
[1:25:12] and they're
[1:25:13] want to overcome this or overcome that
[1:25:16] and
[1:25:17] they start feeling like they've got to
[1:25:18] go somewhere i got to move here i got to
[1:25:20] go do this you don't have to go anywhere
[1:25:22] you don't have to move anywhere
[1:25:25] you don't have to go anywhere
[1:25:27] all you have to do
[1:25:29] is travel there
[1:25:31] amen
[1:25:32] through prayer
[1:25:34] through faith
[1:25:35] god can meet you in your house
[1:25:38] god can meet you driving your car down
[1:25:40] the road
[1:25:41] god can come in and do mighty things for
[1:25:43] you when you're out camping
[1:25:45] god can do mighty things for you sitting
[1:25:47] on the church pew this morning
[1:25:49] and god can do mighty things for you on
[1:25:51] wednesday night when you come to church
[1:25:53] amen come on saints of god
[1:25:55] god is not limited he doesn't just
[1:25:57] arrive on sunday morning
[1:25:59] he is there 24 7. the angels of god are
[1:26:03] there 24 7. he knows everything you're
[1:26:06] thinking your thoughts speak louder in
[1:26:08] heaven than your words do on earth
[1:26:13] hallelujah
[1:26:15] glory hey hallelujah
[1:26:20] one time
[1:26:24] i was struggling about something
[1:26:28] i'll just tell you
[1:26:29] i was sitting underneath the ministry
[1:26:32] that wasn't preaching the truth
[1:26:35] and i was struggling and i just knew
[1:26:36] something was wrong
[1:26:38] so i went into very much consecration
[1:26:41] and prayer
[1:26:42] fasting and praying and praying and
[1:26:44] praying
[1:26:46] and spending my time and my hours
[1:26:47] praying alone
[1:26:49] and one afternoon i was praying and i
[1:26:51] was laying on the floor prostrate before
[1:26:52] the lord my wife was gone and i was
[1:26:55] crying out to god and all of a sudden i
[1:26:58] went somewhere
[1:26:59] i went into a vision
[1:27:01] and in the vision i saw a giant stamp
[1:27:04] stamp the church door and move away and
[1:27:06] the word ichabod was left that means the
[1:27:09] lord thy god had departed
[1:27:12] how did i get there by prayer how did i
[1:27:14] get there by god's grace
[1:27:16] amen where did i go i didn't go anywhere
[1:27:18] physically but i moved into an
[1:27:20] atmosphere amen i moved into the
[1:27:23] presence of god amen and god spoke to me
[1:27:26] god showed me a vision i'm asking you
[1:27:29] this morning can you believe god can you
[1:27:32] trust god can you sit in your seat this
[1:27:34] morning and start to doubt your doubts
[1:27:36] and start to ask god
[1:27:38] because he knows
[1:27:41] your need
[1:27:44] [Music]
[1:27:49] sometimes we come to church church is
[1:27:51] the house of god
[1:27:53] sometimes we come to church we're
[1:27:54] worried about what our brother and
[1:27:55] sister our neighbor will think about us
[1:27:58] he says well i really would have jumped
[1:28:00] up and shouted and praise the lord
[1:28:01] but i didn't really want to get out of
[1:28:03] the line
[1:28:05] sometimes young people they sit there
[1:28:08] and they know
[1:28:10] and even old people they know
[1:28:12] there's a need in their heart
[1:28:15] and the spirit of god moving
[1:28:17] but they become resistable
[1:28:19] but it's not really them that's
[1:28:21] resistable
[1:28:22] it's a spirit of the enemy that's
[1:28:23] resistable
[1:28:24] and brother brandon said do you notice
[1:28:26] in discernment when i start to discern
[1:28:27] people many times their faces change
[1:28:30] he said they changed his basic not the
[1:28:32] person he said but the devil get ready
[1:28:33] to be exposed
[1:28:35] and that's why these kind of meetings
[1:28:36] sometimes make people nervous
[1:28:38] because the devil getting ready to be
[1:28:39] exposed
[1:28:41] and all of a sudden because you want to
[1:28:43] know the importance of exposing the
[1:28:44] devil because he's easy to cast out once
[1:28:47] he's exposed
[1:28:48] the minute that you recognize that's not
[1:28:50] you that's the devil you have the right
[1:28:53] and you can cast him out
[1:29:00] isaiah's vision changed his perception
[1:29:03] my vision changed my perception
[1:29:06] cohesive vision changes perception
[1:29:09] praise the lord amen
[1:29:12] and what did the lord say to the
[1:29:13] deception in this age this age is the
[1:29:15] most deceiving age
[1:29:19] this is the age the hardest stage
[1:29:22] that's right
[1:29:23] this is the age full of sciences of the
[1:29:25] age full of all kinds of crazy stuff
[1:29:29] this is the age with less people
[1:29:30] believing in god and more people you say
[1:29:33] but the churches are filled with with
[1:29:35] people going to church the denominations
[1:29:36] let me tell you something
[1:29:38] they don't believe god the way you do
[1:29:40] and i don't mean just the message i mean
[1:29:42] they don't literally believe that he's
[1:29:45] actually real
[1:29:47] they don't believe the stories in the
[1:29:48] bible to them their allegories and their
[1:29:50] good stories but that's not the way we
[1:29:52] believe god we believe jesus christ is
[1:29:55] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:29:58] the true church still cast out devils
[1:30:01] the true church still heal the sick
[1:30:04] we still believe in the old-fashioned
[1:30:07] holy ghost-filled gospel
[1:30:11] and that's what separates us from this
[1:30:13] deceiving age
[1:30:15] the church of the living god has power
[1:30:19] power to heal power to save power to
[1:30:21] transform
[1:30:24] power
[1:30:25] to take those thoughts that are plaguing
[1:30:27] your mind and cast them out
[1:30:30] hallelujah
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:36] the lord told us the deception is
[1:30:37] denominational blindness
[1:30:39] in this laodicean age
[1:30:42] they're blind
[1:30:45] 52 genders they're crazy
[1:30:47] they're blind
[1:30:49] they're insane
[1:30:51] to believe there's more than a man and a
[1:30:53] woman
[1:30:54] you tell me they have their right mind
[1:30:56] they don't have the right mind
[1:30:58] i don't want their psychology books i
[1:31:00] don't want their religious books i don't
[1:31:02] want anything they have to offer give me
[1:31:05] the bible give me the message of the
[1:31:07] hour give me jesus christ the same
[1:31:10] yesterday today and forever
[1:31:12] hallelujah
[1:31:14] what they call science i don't even want
[1:31:16] to hear it
[1:31:17] [Applause]
[1:31:18] [Music]
[1:31:20] people get caught up believers get
[1:31:22] caught up climate change how do you know
[1:31:24] it's real
[1:31:28] they told us way back then he said
[1:31:29] science proved if a ball could move if
[1:31:32] an object could move more than 35 miles
[1:31:33] an hour it would leave the earth
[1:31:35] that never happened
[1:31:37] there was doing a study the scientists
[1:31:39] were doing a study at the kennel state
[1:31:40] park when they used to play baseball way
[1:31:42] back in the early 1900s nobody ever hit
[1:31:44] it out of the field
[1:31:46] they did a study is it possible to hit
[1:31:48] it out of the field
[1:31:50] the science concluded it's physically
[1:31:52] impossible
[1:31:54] and right after they come to the
[1:31:55] conclusion somebody
[1:31:57] hit it out of the field
[1:31:59] and it's been hit out of the field many
[1:32:00] times since
[1:32:03] that's just science
[1:32:05] some of it's okay some of us are okay
[1:32:07] how do you know what's okay how do you
[1:32:08] know what's not okay brother brown said
[1:32:10] how do we know north is north and south
[1:32:11] this south
[1:32:13] how do we know these things we don't
[1:32:14] know
[1:32:15] but what we do know
[1:32:18] is that this bible
[1:32:21] is nothing but the truth
[1:32:24] this bible still saves for the god of
[1:32:26] the bible
[1:32:27] still saved still heals amen
[1:32:30] he can still heal the blind he can give
[1:32:33] blind eyesight
[1:32:35] he can heal the lame and they can walk
[1:32:38] again just like a young little boy
[1:32:40] he can do the mighty acts that he did in
[1:32:43] the scriptures he does the mighty acts
[1:32:45] that he did in the prophets ministry
[1:32:47] that's our god that's our god that's our
[1:32:50] god that's our god
[1:32:53] [Music]
[1:32:55] that's not your preachers that's our god
[1:33:03] the sick sense faith
[1:33:06] believes all things
[1:33:07] are possible
[1:33:10] the sixth sense faith believes angelic
[1:33:13] beings are present
[1:33:16] the
[1:33:17] uh sixth sense of faith
[1:33:19] knows that god can change the scene
[1:33:22] faith put you in a position
[1:33:25] to where you can come to church and you
[1:33:27] have a need and you can come with
[1:33:29] expectation and that faith will bring
[1:33:32] jehovah god our lord jesus christ on the
[1:33:35] scene for your life
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:42] one time i needed a healing
[1:33:44] i had just athlete's foot i probably
[1:33:46] could have went to the doctor and maybe
[1:33:47] got some medication
[1:33:49] and it really hurts if you've ever had
[1:33:50] athlete's foot it was all over my feet i
[1:33:52] didn't actually know what it was at the
[1:33:53] time
[1:33:54] and i was embarrassed i don't always see
[1:33:55] my feet that's disgusting
[1:33:58] what is going on with me
[1:34:00] and i thought but god is still
[1:34:02] healer so i prayed lord i want you to
[1:34:05] heal my feet
[1:34:07] and i'm coming expectation
[1:34:09] and lord this is the way i prayed i said
[1:34:11] lord
[1:34:12] i know you're my healer
[1:34:14] and i pray lord
[1:34:16] that when the time is right because
[1:34:18] remember the angel of the lord come to
[1:34:19] the city after brother and prayed for
[1:34:20] those people the goiter fell off and the
[1:34:22] healings took place
[1:34:24] some two weeks later
[1:34:25] i said if it with the visit so you can
[1:34:27] get you can it doesn't matter your
[1:34:29] healing going to come
[1:34:30] and then i'm sitting there i said at the
[1:34:32] right time and all of a sudden one day
[1:34:33] during church the holy spirit moved and
[1:34:35] the holy spirit spoke right to my heart
[1:34:37] and said now it's your time
[1:34:38] i went up to the altar and a guy that
[1:34:40] come pray for me was a known hypocrite
[1:34:43] don't even know why he was up there
[1:34:45] why do preachers around this message
[1:34:47] preach these kind of men
[1:34:49] a man in adultery
[1:34:51] huh we don't need that trash we need the
[1:34:54] spirit of god
[1:34:56] amen
[1:34:57] and he walked up and i stopped myself i
[1:34:59] said i'm not letting that man pray for
[1:35:00] me
[1:35:01] but then a thought came
[1:35:03] amen
[1:35:05] you don't have to worry about the man
[1:35:08] worry about my word
[1:35:10] god honors my word
[1:35:12] i mean i honor my word and i ran up and
[1:35:14] i said lord i'm trusting you he laid
[1:35:16] hands on me and god healed me
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:19] [Applause]
[1:35:22] praise the lord now that's just that's
[1:35:23] just a testimony right we all have
[1:35:25] testimonies but where is your testimony
[1:35:28] and and those testimonies are from the
[1:35:31] days gone by
[1:35:32] what about right now
[1:35:34] what do we believe right now
[1:35:37] do we still believe that god can heal us
[1:35:40] do we still believe god can deliver us
[1:35:42] do we still believe god the holy spirit
[1:35:46] can go out to our children and go out to
[1:35:48] our family members and save them
[1:35:51] hallelujah
[1:35:57] so there are many things
[1:36:01] that faith can open our eyes to the
[1:36:03] supernatural presence of god
[1:36:07] faith change peter's perception
[1:36:11] man can't walk on water
[1:36:14] it's impossible for man to walk on water
[1:36:19] come on church
[1:36:21] do you actually think people can walk on
[1:36:23] water
[1:36:25] they can't
[1:36:27] but through god
[1:36:28] all things are possible
[1:36:30] walk on water
[1:36:32] peter said lord did that be you bid me
[1:36:33] come to thee he said come he walked on
[1:36:35] water
[1:36:36] he was walking on water
[1:36:40] and all of a sudden he started to
[1:36:42] think about the waves and the water and
[1:36:45] we can't walk on water
[1:36:47] we cannot walk on water
[1:36:54] they come up they get prayed for he said
[1:36:56] well he's a person that caught get up
[1:36:58] out of the cot
[1:36:59] they rise up
[1:37:00] they haven't stood out of the cop for
[1:37:01] years
[1:37:03] and then somebody said oh get back in
[1:37:04] the car get back in a wheelchair and he
[1:37:06] said if they get back in their
[1:37:07] wheelchair they're going to die in that
[1:37:08] wheelchair
[1:37:11] and sometimes we come up and we ask god
[1:37:13] god pray for me and the rest of our life
[1:37:15] we spend our time thinking i don't know
[1:37:17] why i couldn't muster up the faith for
[1:37:18] god to pray for me i mean to heal me
[1:37:21] and then therefore we settle back down
[1:37:22] on the church and we forget about it
[1:37:25] and then we start testifying of our
[1:37:27] sickness we start testifying of our
[1:37:28] weakness we start testifying where we
[1:37:31] were defeated
[1:37:34] but we know that god is able
[1:37:37] but the problem is the devil try to lie
[1:37:39] to your mind and tell you but he's not
[1:37:41] willing
[1:37:43] all things are possible to them that can
[1:37:46] believe
[1:37:48] right
[1:37:49] john ryan came through the line and
[1:37:50] brother branham prayed for him and he
[1:37:51] walked off the line he was a blind man
[1:37:53] he walked off the line pretty soon he'd
[1:37:55] come back through the line he'd come
[1:37:56] back up brother brown said i've already
[1:37:58] prayed for you
[1:37:59] he said do i know sir but i can't see
[1:38:02] he said but you said you believed
[1:38:05] he said you believed
[1:38:07] you told me when i pray for you you will
[1:38:08] believe
[1:38:10] he says and now you don't believe
[1:38:12] he said if you don't believe you're
[1:38:14] going to stay blind your whole life he
[1:38:15] said i do believe you sir i don't have
[1:38:17] any reason not to believe you he said
[1:38:18] then go and testify that you have been
[1:38:21] healed
[1:38:25] so he was on i think he sold newspapers
[1:38:27] on the corner he was testifying extra
[1:38:29] extra
[1:38:30] the lord god had healed me in a meeting
[1:38:32] last night
[1:38:33] very soon a few weeks i was going by

[1:38:43] around watch this hey you can see pretty
[1:38:46] good huh i can see god open my eyes
[1:38:49] i'm healed
[1:38:50] he was looking at the promise of god
[1:38:53] he was looking at the unseen he was
[1:38:55] believing god you were not looking at
[1:38:58] the circumstances he were not paying
[1:39:00] attention to the light spectrum he was
[1:39:02] going beyond the light spectrum
[1:39:05] [Applause]
[1:39:09] oh you can see pretty good and all of a
[1:39:11] sudden his eyes open
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:15] a few years ago a sister in belgium i
[1:39:17] think it's belgium if i remember right
[1:39:18] brother daryl was there preaching
[1:39:20] this girl she was born without a hip
[1:39:22] socket
[1:39:23] so she
[1:39:26] come up to get prayed for
[1:39:29] and then brother daryl told her
[1:39:31] you go testify that jesus christ has
[1:39:33] healed you
[1:39:35] and then write me when he has
[1:39:38] so this went on for a couple years
[1:39:44] she never talked about her
[1:39:46] bad hip
[1:39:47] but every time that somebody will say
[1:39:50] do anybody got a testimony
[1:39:54] i want to thank god for healing me
[1:39:58] and she'll come into the church
[1:40:00] and she'll walk out of the church
[1:40:04] but there was something in her she
[1:40:06] believed
[1:40:08] she knew that god was willing to keep
[1:40:10] his promise
[1:40:11] and that god was able to keep his
[1:40:12] promise
[1:40:14] and she wasn't taking no for an answer
[1:40:16] she was not taking the devil's answer
[1:40:18] she were not taking the doctor's disease
[1:40:20] the doctor's name or whatever else
[1:40:22] and it got so bad that her parents told
[1:40:24] her you stopped saying that in church
[1:40:27] you're embarrassing the family
[1:40:29] believers
[1:40:32] believers
[1:40:34] hmm
[1:40:37] so
[1:40:39] she's sitting in church
[1:40:41] the pastor's anybody got a testimony
[1:40:44] she says i've got one
[1:40:48] and her friends looked at her not again
[1:40:51] really
[1:40:52] she said i want to thank jesus christ
[1:40:54] for healing me
[1:40:56] and about that time they hurt
[1:40:58] and
[1:40:59] and god put a new hip socket in her body
[1:41:03] and she can walk you running around the
[1:41:05] building
[1:41:05] [Applause]
[1:41:06] [Music]

[1:47:41] indians
[1:47:43] where are they at
[1:47:44] i don't know but they're here
[1:47:47] and if i had a tv i could put a tv out
[1:47:49] and i could turn it on and i could drive
[1:47:51] that tv right into the fourth dimension
[1:47:53] pull that show that i want to see
[1:47:55] bonanza that's right this is actually a
[1:47:56] stupid show
[1:47:58] used to watch when i was a kid and
[1:47:59] thought it was so cool
[1:48:02] and i watched one some years ago and i
[1:48:05] thought well that's really lame
[1:48:07] i didn't even know all that junk was in
[1:48:09] it
[1:48:10] but the tv could reach up in the fourth
[1:48:11] dimension and pull it down
[1:48:16] now every single one of you are sitting
[1:48:17] there going you know i know that's true
[1:48:18] sure it's true
[1:48:20] of course it's true
[1:48:22] right
[1:48:23] i mean how do we take
[1:48:25] these things here

[1:49:01] right then

[1:49:04] prophet god told us is nothing but the
[1:49:06] truth there's a fourth dimension in the
[1:49:08] in the light spectrum and science has
[1:49:11] figured out how to tap into that and
[1:49:13] pull it down well let me tell you
[1:49:15] something if science can prove that and
[1:49:17] bring that down that means at that other
[1:49:19] dimension where god dwells you have been
[1:49:21] given a channel of faith you have been
[1:49:23] given a channel to reach out to reach up
[1:49:26] and pull down that faith pull down that
[1:49:29] promise

[1:49:57] going to cool off
[1:49:58] and just become a church

[1:56:34] allowed to use the covenant church for
[1:56:35] our meetings
[1:56:37] so we had to have a meeting with the
[1:56:38] pastor of the covenant church and he
[1:56:39] said oh no no we have this guy uh he
[1:56:42] paul paul's journeys he's coming through
[1:56:44] and we're going to have a meeting and
[1:56:45] but you guys are welcome to come
[1:56:48] well that wasn't what they told us
[1:56:51] so i was just sitting there we're in a
[1:56:53] little little uh they have little houses
[1:56:55] most of them aren't very big not even as
[1:56:57] big as this room probably are about the
[1:56:59] same size i guess
[1:57:00] we're sitting in there
[1:57:05] and brother andrew asked this minister
[1:57:06] he says
[1:57:07] have you ever read the church age book
[1:57:09] that i gave you the blue book
[1:57:11] and i thought uh oh
[1:57:14] oh lord
[1:57:16] i got up and i went to use the bathroom
[1:57:18] and got down started praying lord help
[1:57:20] us
[1:57:21] we're fixing to get in a rat's race here
[1:57:23] a big mess i know we are i said lord
[1:57:24] please help us
[1:57:26] so i came back out and i said lord i'm
[1:57:28] just going to keep my mouth shut
[1:57:30] i'm not going to say anything i'm going
[1:57:31] to be quiet
[1:57:33] i went back out sat down
[1:57:35] and then brother they're talking and he
[1:57:38] says
[1:57:39] brother andrew says well just ask
[1:57:40] brother flynn he knows
[1:57:42] i'm like no please
[1:57:45] so here these two big men
[1:57:48] say
[1:57:50] you mean to tell us that you believe
[1:57:52] jesus christ visited this generation
[1:57:54] through a prophet of god
[1:57:56] and i said well that's exactly what we
[1:57:58] believe
[1:57:59] and as soon as i said that's exactly
[1:58:00] what we leave they both went back in
[1:58:02] their chairs and almost fell back they
[1:58:04] were like whoa and then they came
[1:58:06] forward and then they started
[1:58:08] and as soon as they started the door
[1:58:10] kicked open and brother john came in
[1:58:13] because when we showed up and they said
[1:58:14] we couldn't use the covenant church he
[1:58:16] looked at he says i'm gonna go find a
[1:58:17] place for church and he left
[1:58:19] then he comes back well they sent this
[1:58:22] man
[1:58:22] to seminary school
[1:58:24] brother john
[1:58:26] so when he comes back in the pastor
[1:58:28] harvey says oh brother john you came for
[1:58:30] the meetings after all
[1:58:31] because an income for your guys
[1:58:33] denominational meetings is that i came
[1:58:35] with these brothers so we could have
[1:58:36] church and by the way brothers my
[1:58:38] parents said since they won't let us use
[1:58:39] the church building we can have church
[1:58:40] at their house and they're already
[1:58:42] broadcasting it across the vhf all over
[1:58:44] all over the city all over the town
[1:58:47] all right so we got right out of there
[1:58:48] before they get chastised i was real
[1:58:50] good
[1:58:52] we went up to have church
[1:58:54] we're sitting in a room
[1:58:56] amen that's smaller than this the the
[1:58:58] the living rooms like that and then the
[1:59:00] the rooms are there just they just have
[1:59:01] like a curtain hanging there
[1:59:04] and i'm back there trying to pray
[1:59:06] young preacher
[1:59:08] and i'm trying to pray and get ready for
[1:59:10] service and i never preached in this
[1:59:12] kind of environment
[1:59:13] well and i mean exactly like that i had
[1:59:15] preaching homes but they were believers
[1:59:17] these were no believers
[1:59:19] except brother andrew was there and
[1:59:21] another couple believers but the rest of
[1:59:22] them there were like 18 people there and
[1:59:24] they were not i'm 18 13 i think it was
[1:59:26] 18. 18 people there never even heard the
[1:59:28] message
[1:59:29] and we're sitting in there and uh you
[1:59:32] know they're we're trying to get ready
[1:59:34] for service and the phone rings yeah
[1:59:36] hello what do you want they're trying to
[1:59:37] lead songs
[1:59:38] yeah i know we're getting ready to have
[1:59:40] church ah yeah okay okay yeah that
[1:59:42] sounds good click
[1:59:44] people running out and out
[1:59:46] making noise
[1:59:48] i thought oh god have mercy
[1:59:50] waste our time coming here
[1:59:52] oh god no no feeling
[1:59:54] and preach i like to have feeling before
[1:59:55] i come out
[2:00:00] this way that's why the
[2:00:01] what the preacher knows and he loves
[2:00:03] sometimes he can come he's ready but but
[2:00:05] he's waiting for the lord
[2:00:07] and then when they call the preacher
[2:00:08] usually they're about to win the holy
[2:00:10] spirit strike them
[2:00:12] and all of a sudden they come in a
[2:00:13] stronger way
[2:00:15] and all of a sudden you're back there in
[2:00:17] the little room and wham
[2:00:19] and now now i'm ready to preach
[2:00:21] maybe before the i don't want to be here
[2:00:23] and so i'm sitting there and now all of
[2:00:25] a sudden
[2:00:26] this old eskimo woman stands up and
[2:00:28] starts talking and i thought great
[2:00:30] we got a woman preacher in our midst wow
[2:00:33] this is going from bad to worse
[2:00:36] but i'm sitting there thinking well lord
[2:00:37] you know you did send us here we believe
[2:00:40] and we're trying our best and
[2:00:44] so then she sets down
[2:00:46] so then it's time for me to preach i'm
[2:00:48] like wow standing in the living room
[2:00:51] these people all sitting there
[2:00:54] tv here
[2:00:55] kitchen here everything open
[2:00:58] pretty soon i'm trying to preach these
[2:00:59] little kids running
[2:01:00] hey
[2:01:01] and they walk what's going on one turns
[2:01:03] on the tv the get up turn off the tv and
[2:01:08] in there making peanut butter jelly
[2:01:09] sandwich talking and screaming and i'm
[2:01:11] preaching
[2:01:13] i'm like wow
[2:01:17] lord help me survive this
[2:01:20] so i got done preaching
[2:01:22] and i'm like this is the worst message
[2:01:25] that i've ever preached
[2:01:27] this is the worst atmosphere i've ever
[2:01:28] been in
[2:01:30] uh well okay this was a defeated one
[2:01:32] here
[2:01:33] i don't know and a thought came to me
[2:01:36] brother benham said no service is
[2:01:38] complete without an altar call
[2:01:40] he said that one place
[2:01:44] well
[2:01:44] okay i'll i'll throw an altar call out
[2:01:46] there
[2:01:48] and i gave an altar call
[2:01:50] and all of a sudden the pillar of fire
[2:01:52] dropped in that house
[2:01:55] it was so bright we could hardly see the
[2:01:57] light
[2:01:59] every single one of those perfect people
[2:02:00] were baptized they were at the altar
[2:02:02] weeping and crying asking god forgive me
[2:02:05] help me give me the holy ghost
[2:02:08] and the old man and the old women who
[2:02:10] couldn't even speak english they were
[2:02:12] also there crying and weeping and
[2:02:14] thinking god
[2:02:18] glory to god
[2:02:20] but the beautiful thing thank you jesus
[2:02:22] was that when that old eskimo woman
[2:02:24] stood up and started tested started
[2:02:26] testifying
[2:02:27] i thought well what you know she's
[2:02:28] preaching you know a woman preacher
[2:02:30] she stands up she starts testifying
[2:02:33] she's telling them of a dream
[2:02:35] she said you know they they he would
[2:02:37] they were the parents of the of of all
[2:02:39] the people
[2:02:40] and grandparents and she said you know
[2:02:42] that me and dad we go to church all the
[2:02:44] time
[2:02:45] we don't understand a word they preach
[2:02:46] because we don't speak english there's
[2:02:48] no bible in their language
[2:02:50] they said but we know god is real
[2:02:52] and we've been praying
[2:02:54] and we were praying for god to help us
[2:02:57] and she said and i saw a dream i had a
[2:02:59] dream and i told you some of you about
[2:03:01] this dream there's a white man that come
[2:03:03] across and they come to this village and
[2:03:05] then she points i didn't know she was
[2:03:06] saying this she points and she says
[2:03:08] that's the white man in my dream right
[2:03:10] there that's him
[2:03:14] our god
[2:03:15] is still the same
[2:03:17] yesterday today and forever
[2:03:24] hallelujah
[2:03:26] so i'll ask you my brother sister what
[2:03:28] miracle do you need god to perform
[2:03:32] i say well i'll be glad for healing good
[2:03:33] then be glad for healing and receive it
[2:03:37] i need the devil to quit plaguing my
[2:03:39] mind then good speak to that devil right
[2:03:41] now because the bible said the believers
[2:03:43] will cast out the devil
[2:03:45] it didn't say the preachers will cast
[2:03:47] out the devil it said the believers will
[2:03:49] cast out the devil
[2:03:52] speak to that devil speak to that liar
[2:03:55] amen we come into the camp of the living
[2:03:58] god and we are here and we're leaving
[2:04:00] with something we didn't just come to
[2:04:02] church to come empty and leave empty we
[2:04:05] came to receive from the living god
[2:04:08] [Applause]
[2:04:10] [Music]
[2:04:14] god's word is true
[2:04:16] the believers lay hands on the sick and
[2:04:17] they shall recover
[2:04:19] that is the truth
[2:04:21] the believers not just the preachers
[2:04:24] come on church
[2:04:28] god can move supernaturally in your life
[2:04:31] you say well i never felt god
[2:04:32] supernaturally god can move
[2:04:33] supernaturally in your life
[2:04:36] god can do a mighty work
[2:04:38] god can change the scene
[2:04:40] you made mistakes you messed everything
[2:04:42] up don't worry about it god's not
[2:04:45] worried about it that's the devil lying
[2:04:47] to you god can change the scene
[2:04:51] [Applause]
[2:04:53] hallelujah
[2:04:56] pick up your board pick up your sword my
[2:04:58] brother
[2:04:59] cast out that devil of torment amen
[2:05:02] hallelujah
[2:05:04] take back your victory take back your
[2:05:06] mountain take back your inspiration take
[2:05:09] back your position in heavenly places
[2:05:13] hallelujah
[2:05:15] sometimes since we just forget who we
[2:05:17] are
[2:05:18] we forget what we're raised up for
[2:05:20] we forget that our god amen he the devil
[2:05:23] bruised him his heel but god stomped on
[2:05:26] that devil amen the mighty conqueror
[2:05:28] defeated him at calvary
[2:05:31] and greater is he that's in you than he
[2:05:33] that's in the world
[2:05:35] there's god living in there that's god
[2:05:37] living in there let the lion speak
[2:05:42] let the faith rise up
[2:05:44] believe god's word
[2:05:54] i remember a story
[2:05:57] you know sometimes we feel all alone
[2:05:58] don't we
[2:05:59] we're going to a trial hard time
[2:06:03] the devil be lying to us
[2:06:05] and we're listening to his lie
[2:06:07] he knows how to get in our complex
[2:06:10] people get complex and
[2:06:12] get in there you know brother brown had
[2:06:14] complexes
[2:06:16] and come home for one night it was his
[2:06:17] birthday and he didn't realize it and he
[2:06:19] got home at night and all these people
[2:06:20] were in there he looked in the window
[2:06:21] and they were all laughing and having a
[2:06:22] good time they were waiting for brother
[2:06:23] brown they're going to give him a
[2:06:24] surprise party
[2:06:26] when he stopped he looked in the window
[2:06:27] he thought man
[2:06:29] if i go in there
[2:06:31] i'm just going to ruin their fun
[2:06:34] and so he went for a long drive
[2:06:36] not even knowing they were in there
[2:06:37] waiting for him
[2:06:40] it's a complex
[2:06:42] and sometimes when people have complexes
[2:06:44] and mostly everybody has a complex of
[2:06:46] one kind or another
[2:06:48] the devil know how to get into that
[2:06:49] complex sometimes
[2:06:52] and they know how to work that complex
[2:06:54] and they know how to cause problems
[2:06:57] and then pretty soon if you're not
[2:06:58] careful you feel all alone
[2:07:00] and then you don't really want to talk
[2:07:02] about the situation the worst thing a
[2:07:04] person can ever do is clam up and not
[2:07:06] talk about a situation
[2:07:08] you know why
[2:07:09] because when you when you speak of the
[2:07:11] problem
[2:07:13] you're exposing the enemy
[2:07:15] when you expose the enemy he loses his
[2:07:17] ground
[2:07:19] he can't hold on no longer he has to let
[2:07:20] go
[2:07:23] but what happens is he get us he get us
[2:07:25] all beat down he'd get us in a corner
[2:07:26] he'd get us in a complex
[2:07:29] now all of a sudden we don't really want
[2:07:30] to go to church and whatever happening
[2:07:32] and all these things are happening
[2:07:35] and pretty soon we start to think well
[2:07:36] you know
[2:07:38] maybe i'm not really a believer
[2:07:40] and the devil pretty good at that didn't
[2:07:42] he
[2:07:43] you're not really a believer been
[2:07:44] baptized the name of jesus christ got
[2:07:45] filled with the holy ghost been serving
[2:07:46] god your whole life and all of a sudden
[2:07:48] you're not a believer just because
[2:07:49] you're going through a hard time
[2:07:51] well i got news for the devil we can't
[2:07:53] lose our salvation
[2:07:55] we can only lose our fellowship with god
[2:07:56] we cannot lose our salvation
[2:07:58] and brother said the holy spirit just
[2:08:00] wait for you he's waiting he wants to
[2:08:02] come back in
[2:08:03] he wants to bring the revival back he
[2:08:05] wants the sweetness back he wants the
[2:08:06] fellowship back he want it back more
[2:08:08] than you wanted he wants to save you
[2:08:10] more than you want to be saved
[2:08:12] he wants to heal you more than you want
[2:08:13] to be healed
[2:08:15] he wants you to stand here and be able
[2:08:16] to give a testimony and i'm in the
[2:08:17] testimony not of talking about your
[2:08:19] problem i mean a testimony of how the
[2:08:22] power of god came into your life i'm in
[2:08:24] the testimony of a vision a testimony of
[2:08:26] a speaking in tongues a testimony
[2:08:29] a lot of messages we don't believe in
[2:08:30] gifts and we don't believe in speaking
[2:08:32] in tongues that's not my god
[2:08:35] [Applause]
[2:08:37] i've spoken tongues i've seen visions
[2:08:41] i've seen miracles
[2:08:43] i've had god use me into discernment
[2:08:46] i don't believe i have the gift of
[2:08:47] discernment but god has used me that way
[2:08:49] i'm a preacher preachers could use that
[2:08:50] way
[2:08:52] but the devil like to try to
[2:08:54] i isolate somebody and make them start
[2:08:56] feeling like this
[2:08:59] they remind me of a story one time that
[2:09:01] i heard
[2:09:03] i think it was the vietnam war
[2:09:06] and these guys
[2:09:08] they're like commandos the rangers they
[2:09:10] have to go into an area
[2:09:12] a small group of them go in
[2:09:14] they sneak in
[2:09:16] and maybe they have to kill somebody or
[2:09:18] something but they're behind enemy lines
[2:09:21] and then they had a rendezvous
[2:09:23] the helicopter would land at a certain
[2:09:25] time in a certain place they had to be
[2:09:26] there i mean these guys are incredible
[2:09:28] they have to have compasses and gps's
[2:09:30] and they got to figure all this stuff
[2:09:32] out they got to sneak be quiet get
[2:09:33] through the woods they're in the enemy
[2:09:35] there's enemies all around them
[2:09:36] and then there's the rendezvous and they
[2:09:38] got to get there well one of these one
[2:09:39] of these men by time he got he bite he
[2:09:42] was running late because he was there
[2:09:43] were too many enemies he had to stay
[2:09:44] still he had to stay right where he was
[2:09:46] when he was finally ready he could go he
[2:09:48] took off he got but when he got there
[2:09:50] the helicopter was gone
[2:09:52] everybody was gone he was all by himself
[2:09:56] behind enemy lines
[2:09:58] and i thought that's just like a
[2:10:00] believer
[2:10:01] when the devil get them beat down and
[2:10:02] they start thinking like that and
[2:10:04] they're behind enemy lines and they
[2:10:05] don't realize
[2:10:07] and the helicopters left and there they
[2:10:09] are
[2:10:11] and all he had was communication so he
[2:10:14] communicated back
[2:10:16] to the chief or whoever
[2:10:18] whatever they call him
[2:10:20] and the guy talking to him on the phone
[2:10:23] he's like
[2:10:25] this guy
[2:10:27] is in big trouble
[2:10:29] what are we going to do
[2:10:31] we can't go get them
[2:10:33] it would be certain death to send a
[2:10:34] helicopter and we would all die we can't
[2:10:36] go get this man
[2:10:39] and the man's like okay man here's my
[2:10:40] coordinates can you come get me
[2:10:44] he says
[2:10:45] no we can't come get you
[2:10:47] and all of a sudden the man start
[2:10:49] breaking down
[2:10:50] oh my goodness what am i gonna do

[2:10:57] am i going to do i feel like god has

[2:10:59] myself i'm all alone i'm scared to talk
[2:11:01] to the past i don't know what to do
[2:11:05] and the man the leader on the phone
[2:11:07] on the whatever you call that started
[2:11:09] speaking to him
