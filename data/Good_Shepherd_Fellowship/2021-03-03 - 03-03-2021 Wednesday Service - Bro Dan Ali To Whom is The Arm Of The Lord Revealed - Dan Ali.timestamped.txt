[48:00] your seat
[48:02] while we pray
[48:07] almost gracious and eternal father we
[48:10] are so grateful that once again we have
[48:12] come before your turn of grace
[48:14] expecting to see you lord and to hear
[48:16] from you
[48:18] for we have not come to see a man or to
[48:20] hear a man speak
[48:21] we have come because your word says
[48:23] where two or three are gathered in your
[48:25] name there you are in their midst
[48:27] we are here because we believe in your
[48:29] word of promise
[48:30] come and honor yourself tonight lord you
[48:33] know the
[48:34] knees that are on our hearts father oh
[48:36] god
[48:37] may you minister unto every single soul
[48:39] tonight
[48:40] that going forward our lives would never
[48:42] be the same
[48:44] in the name of jesus father come and
[48:46] have your way
[48:47] in jesus name father we pray with
[48:49] thanksgiving
[48:50] amen while we are so standing
[48:55] can we open our bibles to
[49:00] the book of isaiah isaiah 53.
[49:21] isaiah 53 who have believed
[49:25] our report
[49:28] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[49:30] revealed
[49:32] for he shall grow up before him as a
[49:35] tender plant
[49:37] and as a root out of the dry ground
[49:40] he have no form of calmliness and when
[49:44] he shall see him there is no beauty
[49:47] that we should desire him he is despised
[49:50] and rejected of man
[49:52] a man of sorrows and acquainted with
[49:56] grief
[49:57] and we hit as it were our faces from him
[50:01] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[50:05] surely he have borne our griefs
[50:08] and carried our sorrows yet
[50:12] we deem we did esteem him
[50:15] stricken smitten of god and afflicted
[50:19] but he was wounded for our
[50:21] transgressions he was bruised
[50:23] for our iniquities and the chastisement
[50:26] of our peace was upon him
[50:28] and with his stripes we are healed
[50:32] praise be to god shall we be seated
[50:39] good to see you saints and god bless you
[50:42] all for coming
[50:44] it's always a joy to be in the house of
[50:46] the lord we know it is not easy
[50:49] um and we don't expect it to be easy
[50:55] yes it's a very difficult moment we are
[50:59] living in
[51:01] and when we make it to come to service
[51:06] i just want to encourage ourselves that
[51:09] we should try as much as we can
[51:12] to make very good use of the time
[51:16] um we don't come to service
[51:19] just to do it i mean to do a head count
[51:23] we come with expectations on our house
[51:27] and if you come expecting
[51:30] god will surely bless you there is no
[51:33] doubt about it there are no two ways
[51:35] about it
[51:36] so when you come i know
[51:40] you know sometimes you come to church
[51:42] and um
[51:44] sadly you see people just sleeping
[51:48] um i i just don't know how that works
[51:53] yeah i don't know how it works
[51:57] because the bible says man shall not
[51:59] live by bread alone
[52:01] but by every word that proceeds out of
[52:03] the mouth of god
[52:05] so by you feeding listening to the word
[52:07] of god you are feeding on the word
[52:10] and how can a man be eating and sleeping
[52:12] at the same time
[52:16] i haven't seen that probably the only
[52:19] time i came across
[52:20] something very close was when somebody
[52:23] got drunk
[52:24] and the food was before him and he will
[52:27] go
[52:27] take food and then he'll miss the soup
[52:30] and the food goes on the table
[52:32] and then you put it in his mouth
[52:36] sleep is a good thing don't get me wrong
[52:40] sleep is a good thing as we said during
[52:43] the prayer series
[52:45] if you are not getting sleep when you
[52:48] have gone to work and you have come back
[52:49] from work
[52:50] and you are tired if you are not getting
[52:53] sleep
[52:54] it's time to pray
[52:57] but if you come to the house of god to
[53:01] come and sleep
[53:02] that is a very dangerous place to sleep
[53:06] because as people sit and they are
[53:08] listening to the word
[53:10] and they are receiving from god demons
[53:14] are being cast out
[53:17] you could be an easy target
[53:22] praise be to god so sleeping in the
[53:25] house of god is no good thing
[53:28] and if you are sleeping it's okay to
[53:30] feel sleepy in the house of god
[53:32] but fight it if you have to get up and
[53:35] stand get up and stand
[53:37] praise be to god by the grace of god
[53:41] this morning i mean tonight
[53:43] yeah it's like my time zone is reversed
[53:49] we are going to look at
[53:55] to whom is the arm of the lord revealed
[53:59] a message the prophet preached
[54:03] and i'm drawing my inspiration from this
[54:08] tonight
[54:10] the scripture we just read there was
[54:14] something that caught my attention so
[54:15] much
[54:17] and i've been a man who loves farming as
[54:20] you all know
[54:22] by now
[54:29] who have believed our report and to whom
[54:32] is the arm of the lord revealed
[54:35] he shall he shall grow up
[54:38] before him as a tender plant
[54:42] as a tender plant i spent a lot of time
[54:47] just looking at this as a tender plant
[54:50] now when a farmer finds a piece of land
[54:54] to grow his crops
[54:57] he doesn't just go and in the midst of
[54:58] the bushes and the trees
[55:00] he starts planting if any farmer does
[55:03] that that means there's a problem with
[55:04] that farmer
[55:07] what he does he goes there and what the
[55:10] first things he will do
[55:12] he goes and he starts cutting down the
[55:14] trees
[55:16] just imagine that the head
[55:20] has a voice to speak
[55:24] and then it is covered by these bushes
[55:27] by this
[55:27] wrist and someone goes there with a
[55:31] power soul
[55:32] and you know how noisy that power source
[55:34] is and then he
[55:35] enters that forest and then he puts it
[55:39] on
[55:39] and he begins to cast it cuts down the
[55:41] trees
[55:43] imagine how the land is going to
[55:45] complain
[55:46] who is here to disturb my quiet this
[55:49] person is disturbing my peace
[55:51] and then the chainsaw is just going on
[55:54] and cutting down the trees
[55:56] and then the farmer goes and then he
[55:58] gets a bulldozer
[55:59] and then he comes and then he begins to
[56:03] push down the trees
[56:05] imagine her complain how the heart the
[56:07] land would be complaining
[56:10] and then he approves the storms pushes
[56:13] down the trees
[56:17] and after the bulldozer has done its
[56:19] work
[56:21] when that bulldozer is taken off that
[56:24] land
[56:25] it never comes back to that piece of
[56:27] land again
[56:29] but just think of it all the success
[56:33] story on that farmland
[56:38] is going to be attributed to that work
[56:41] the work the bulldozer did but it is
[56:45] never going to come back to that piece
[56:46] of land again
[56:48] because it has finished with its work
[56:56] after it has leveled the hills
[56:59] and it has filled the slopes filled the
[57:02] valleys
[57:03] and uprooted the storms and thrown them
[57:05] away
[57:08] it is taken of the same
[57:13] but the farmer does not end there and at
[57:15] this point
[57:17] i can hear the land complaining oh you
[57:19] have dug a hole in my back
[57:22] you have put a sword in my back oh you
[57:25] have made life miserable for me
[57:27] and i can hear the farmer say just wait
[57:29] until i'm done with you
[57:30] then the farmer goes for the plow and
[57:33] then he starts plowing the land
[57:35] just breaking the land breaking it apart
[57:38] and when he is done that is not the end
[57:41] of the story
[57:42] he goes and he brings the plow he pulls
[57:44] the plow
[57:46] on the back of the tractor and he walks
[57:48] through
[57:49] and what does the plow do the plow
[57:52] breaks
[57:54] that that that land the lumps into
[57:57] pieces
[57:59] and why is the farmer doing all this
[58:02] is because he has a special crop
[58:06] he is coming to put in that sorry praise
[58:09] the lord
[58:10] praise be to god and when he
[58:14] is done yes he takes that peace
[58:18] the plants the seed and he puts it in
[58:20] the soil thank you jesus
[58:23] now just think about it that before the
[58:26] foundation of this world
[58:28] god placed his seed of life in you
[58:34] and you came into this life
[58:38] and you had a lot of whis
[58:42] growing on your earth man is a piece of
[58:45] head on two feet
[58:48] so now we are moving from this natural
[58:50] edge
[58:51] and we are coming to you as a human
[58:53] being you are a piece of earth
[58:55] on two feet and then you grow into this
[58:58] life
[58:59] and you have a lot of bushes a lot of
[59:02] priests that grow in your life
[59:05] and then by the grace of god god sends
[59:08] a prophet your way
[59:11] and he comes and he begins to deal with
[59:14] your life
[59:16] and a lot of the times what do we do
[59:18] when he begins to level the hills in our
[59:20] lives
[59:22] when he begins to feel the slopes in our
[59:24] lives
[59:25] when he begins to cut down the trees
[59:28] when he begins to approve the storms
[59:30] what do we do we complain and we give
[59:32] excuses
[59:34] because we have grown to love those
[59:36] things
[59:37] and they have more or less become our
[59:40] identity
[59:41] but that is not who we really are who we
[59:43] really are
[59:44] is in the inside and the reason why god
[59:48] will send a prophet your way
[59:50] to come and approve those thoughts and
[59:52] to carry on those trees
[59:53] to level the hills and to prepare that
[59:57] earth
[59:57] to prepare that earth is because of that
[1:00:00] seed of life
[1:00:02] god has put in you
[1:00:05] that seed of life must come to life must
[1:00:08] come alive
[1:00:10] praise be to god now think about it
[1:00:13] when the farmer puts the seed in the
[1:00:16] soil
[1:00:18] no matter how much the sun
[1:00:22] bends no matter how much soil
[1:00:27] covers the seed the seed would lie
[1:00:31] there the sunshine
[1:00:36] would never change its dna
[1:00:40] it will never change
[1:00:43] the time it is going to spend on this
[1:00:45] earth
[1:00:47] it is never going to change
[1:00:57] this is its productivity everything that
[1:01:00] plant is going to be
[1:01:02] is locked up in the seed
[1:01:06] thank you jesus and when the rain comes
[1:01:09] down
[1:01:11] and then the rain begins to fall
[1:01:14] there is a change of environment
[1:01:18] in the soil
[1:01:23] and the seed senses that that something
[1:01:26] has changed
[1:01:29] that is why it is not just good to
[1:01:32] forsake the assembling of the saints
[1:01:36] any time the church does have open a
[1:01:38] child of god
[1:01:39] you must be here a lot of the times
[1:01:44] we give good reasons why we shouldn't
[1:01:46] come to church
[1:01:49] but when those same conditions come and
[1:01:52] we are supposed to go to work
[1:01:53] we'll find a way out to make sure we go
[1:01:56] to work
[1:02:01] i have seen several numbers now a lot of
[1:02:03] times you enter your car you want to go
[1:02:05] to work
[1:02:06] you hit the road and the car would make
[1:02:09] a 180 degree tank
[1:02:11] because the roads are slippery the car
[1:02:14] doesn't want to go to work
[1:02:17] but what do you do you force it to go to
[1:02:19] work
[1:02:20] sometimes you enter the ditch you will
[1:02:22] get out and you will go to work anyhow
[1:02:25] even though you are going to get laid
[1:02:26] get work late you still go to work
[1:02:30] but when it rains a little or when it's
[1:02:33] not a little
[1:02:34] the first thing we do we come out and we
[1:02:36] look at the driveway
[1:02:38] how much snow is on the driveway it's a
[1:02:41] good
[1:02:41] excuse not to go to church today you
[1:02:44] know
[1:02:47] technology has made things easy for us
[1:02:53] and it can be a setback
[1:02:57] if god does not help you it's a good
[1:03:00] thing
[1:03:01] if you cannot come to church to stay in
[1:03:04] the house
[1:03:05] and follow the service online it's a
[1:03:07] good thing
[1:03:08] when you are working and you can't make
[1:03:10] it it's a good thing
[1:03:11] it becomes a good resource but
[1:03:15] when you choose not to come to church
[1:03:19] because you can sit home and follow
[1:03:20] service that becomes a bad thing
[1:03:25] staying in the house and following
[1:03:26] service in the house
[1:03:28] is not a substitute to come into the
[1:03:31] house of god
[1:03:34] when we come together and we sing songs
[1:03:36] of praise
[1:03:38] and we sit and we hear the word of god
[1:03:40] preach there is an
[1:03:41] atmosphere that is created and it is the
[1:03:44] atmosphere that brings the results
[1:03:47] you sit down and you hear the word of
[1:03:49] god and things are happening and you
[1:03:51] don't even know it
[1:03:53] praise be to god but tell me
[1:03:56] that when you sit in your house probably
[1:03:59] with a bowl of ice cream and you cross
[1:04:01] your leg and you relax in the couch
[1:04:03] and you're following the service how do
[1:04:04] you get blessed
[1:04:12] i don't want to go too much into that
[1:04:18] but do not use
[1:04:21] technology as a substitute
[1:04:28] when the church does are open a child of
[1:04:31] god
[1:04:31] we expect you to be here if you are sick
[1:04:35] and you can make it that is different
[1:04:37] if you are working we are not asking you
[1:04:38] to leave your work and come here because
[1:04:40] if they suck you we cannot help you
[1:04:42] we expect you to go to work
[1:04:46] but if you can make it don't sit down
[1:04:48] because
[1:04:49] you can sit down and follow service i
[1:04:52] don't know how that helps
[1:04:54] praise be to god so when it rains
[1:05:01] the seed realizes
[1:05:04] that something has changed the
[1:05:06] atmosphere has changed
[1:05:08] it is the atmosphere that brings the
[1:05:09] result
[1:05:11] and the seed now dies
[1:05:15] for that seed to live the seed has to
[1:05:18] die
[1:05:21] for that seed to live the seed has to
[1:05:24] die
[1:05:29] and the bible says except you are born
[1:05:31] again
[1:05:32] there is no way you can understand the
[1:05:34] kingdom of god
[1:05:36] you must be born again of the spirit of
[1:05:39] god
[1:05:40] it's a must it is the illness of the
[1:05:43] resurrection
[1:05:46] there are no two ways about it you must
[1:05:49] get it or you must get it
[1:05:52] praise be to god you must die to your
[1:05:56] natural self
[1:05:58] a lot of the times we don't die enough
[1:06:02] we are half dead and we are half a life
[1:06:06] and that is how we don't see the power
[1:06:07] of god
[1:06:09] and sometimes actually we are in coma
[1:06:15] and come up to the natural eye in fact
[1:06:18] when there is a dead man
[1:06:20] lying down and there is somebody in coma
[1:06:22] to their natural eye
[1:06:24] they are both dead sure you can't tell
[1:06:27] it takes an instrument
[1:06:29] to tell that oh this one is in coma
[1:06:32] there is still life here
[1:06:33] and this one is actually dead and
[1:06:36] sometimes we are in coma
[1:06:38] and we think we are dead make your
[1:06:41] calling an election show
[1:06:44] this is not time to play church
[1:06:47] it's a very dangerous moment we are
[1:06:49] living in
[1:06:50] that the bible says if it were possible
[1:06:55] the very elect of god will be deceived
[1:06:58] because the two spirits are so close
[1:07:00] together
[1:07:02] that it takes the grace of god yes
[1:07:04] praise the lord
[1:07:05] thank you jesus sir it is no time to
[1:07:08] play church
[1:07:11] set yourself make sure
[1:07:16] that your work with god is locked in
[1:07:19] and that the devil is locked out
[1:07:23] thank you jesus that seed
[1:07:26] in order to get a life it has to die
[1:07:31] and then this plant dies
[1:07:35] and then it begins to grow
[1:07:40] looks very very delicate very delicate
[1:07:45] and depending on what light it is
[1:07:47] sometimes the farmer has to give it a
[1:07:49] support
[1:07:51] would have to come and take it to make
[1:07:54] sure it does not fall
[1:07:56] god giving extra grace to his children
[1:08:01] to help them to stand
[1:08:04] until they are able to stand on their
[1:08:06] feet
[1:08:07] and this plan begins to grow and then
[1:08:10] the farmer comes
[1:08:11] and oh these plants are showing up maybe
[1:08:13] it's a farm
[1:08:14] let's just use corn the corn is growing
[1:08:17] looks so nice then the farmer comes
[1:08:21] when the weeds are growing he comes with
[1:08:24] this hole
[1:08:25] and then he whisks he takes the wheels
[1:08:27] off here in america
[1:08:30] i don't think you know what i'm talking
[1:08:32] about when i talk of hoes
[1:08:35] here everything is technology
[1:08:36] technologically advanced
[1:08:40] praise god you can send your drugs to go
[1:08:44] and spray the farm
[1:08:46] you control the wheats when the farmer
[1:08:49] goes
[1:08:50] and he looks at the crops and they are
[1:08:52] yellowing
[1:08:54] he knows it he can just see it
[1:08:57] from the list that they need help and
[1:09:00] then he goes
[1:09:02] he puts fertilizer when they need water
[1:09:06] he goes
[1:09:08] some have whales on their farms
[1:09:11] others are just by the rivers or the
[1:09:13] lakes
[1:09:15] they can just water it
[1:09:18] and what is the farmer doing
[1:09:21] trying to sustain the crops
[1:09:24] give them everything they need to
[1:09:26] succeed
[1:09:28] so they have no complaint why they
[1:09:31] shouldn't do well
[1:09:33] right now
[1:09:37] the farmer would give the land
[1:09:40] water but the water the farmer is giving
[1:09:45] to the land
[1:09:46] is actually for the crops
[1:09:50] when the farmer is going to give
[1:09:51] fertilizer to the crops
[1:09:53] he comes and he puts it on the soil
[1:09:57] but it is not meant for the soil the
[1:09:59] farmer is not interested
[1:10:00] in the soil he is interested in the
[1:10:03] crops
[1:10:05] when there are whis and the farmer comes
[1:10:08] and he is taking the whis
[1:10:09] he is not interested in how nice he
[1:10:12] wants the land to be no
[1:10:14] he wants to keep the whis away from the
[1:10:16] cross
[1:10:22] god in this life god is going to shower
[1:10:25] a lot of blessings on us
[1:10:28] that when we are hungry he will put food
[1:10:31] on the table
[1:10:32] now when we are sick he will heal us
[1:10:36] that when we are in bondage he will
[1:10:38] deliver us
[1:10:39] when we are in trouble he will visit us
[1:10:43] when we find ourselves in any condition
[1:10:46] god is there to see us through
[1:10:49] but god is not interested in this earth
[1:10:54] god is interested in your real you
[1:10:58] and that is why god is showing his
[1:11:01] blessings
[1:11:02] on the earth
[1:11:07] god would do anything for the sake of
[1:11:12] his elect
[1:11:15] and these crops grow and then they bury
[1:11:20] now it is the same seed
[1:11:24] the same dna
[1:11:27] the same variety that is planted on the
[1:11:31] same soil
[1:11:33] but they are never going to grow
[1:11:37] to yield the same
[1:11:41] a farmer when you go to your corn farm
[1:11:44] you will see some of the corn that the
[1:11:46] cups very big and long
[1:11:49] some are short some
[1:11:52] are very very small
[1:11:55] but they're very small one and a very
[1:11:58] big one
[1:12:00] they are the same
[1:12:04] at harvests when the farmer comes to
[1:12:07] harvest
[1:12:09] he is looking for the original seed
[1:12:13] the seed that went into the soil
[1:12:16] there is a seed he is looking for to
[1:12:18] harvest
[1:12:20] yes thank you jesus so he is looking for
[1:12:24] the original
[1:12:27] so it doesn't really matter whether the
[1:12:30] cop
[1:12:31] is is is is bearing i mean
[1:12:35] has thousands thousand seats on this and
[1:12:37] another one has maybe 10 seed
[1:12:39] no the farmer is not interested in that
[1:12:43] the farmer goes in he picks every single
[1:12:46] one of them
[1:12:48] every single one of them he doesn't
[1:12:50] leave anything behind
[1:12:52] if it is hundred he picks it every
[1:12:54] thousand he picks it
[1:12:55] if it is ten he picks it why because
[1:12:59] it is carrying the original seed
[1:13:02] the sea that went into the soil
[1:13:06] thank you anything you find yourself
[1:13:08] doing for god
[1:13:10] you know sometimes we have the tendency
[1:13:14] to rate our services to god
[1:13:19] that we can we say this is the highest
[1:13:21] this is second this stage
[1:13:23] and we got to a point and we say oh no
[1:13:25] this doesn't really matter
[1:13:31] anything you find yourself doing for god
[1:13:34] do it with your whole heart
[1:13:38] if you find yourself on the instruments
[1:13:41] where is this the piano
[1:13:42] where is the tire what that is the uh
[1:13:44] how did they call it
[1:13:47] the violin i love it so much
[1:13:50] what is the drum i hope i've not left
[1:13:53] anything out
[1:13:56] and if you can't play anything here you
[1:13:58] can clap and you can sing
[1:14:00] [Applause]
[1:14:01] yes
[1:14:05] before any of these instruments we heard
[1:14:07] this
[1:14:09] praise be to god they have never failed
[1:14:14] they are working wonders praise be to
[1:14:17] god amen
[1:14:20] whatever you find yourself doing
[1:14:25] do it to the best
[1:14:31] and know that you are doing it for god
[1:14:34] not to be sin of man
[1:14:38] you are doing it for the love of god
[1:14:42] it doesn't matter how small it is god
[1:14:46] values it as much as he would value
[1:14:49] whatever victim it is
[1:14:53] do not compare yourself one to another
[1:14:56] when we do the bible says we are not
[1:14:58] wise
[1:15:00] whatever it is that god has given you
[1:15:05] use it do not desire to be like another
[1:15:08] person
[1:15:09] because you will never hit your
[1:15:11] potential
[1:15:15] the farmer goes in
[1:15:18] at harvest time and all he is looking
[1:15:21] for
[1:15:23] is the seed that he put in the soil
[1:15:29] the bible says do not be deceived
[1:15:36] god is not mocked whatsoever a muslim
[1:15:40] that shall he reap
[1:15:44] as a matter of fact you a farmer
[1:15:48] if you sowed corn and you went and they
[1:15:51] went and met watermelon would you
[1:15:52] harvest it
[1:15:59] the sort of speed you run to the highway
[1:16:02] only god knows
[1:16:08] so whatever seed god has planted
[1:16:12] that is the seed he is coming for
[1:16:21] to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:16:25] revealed
[1:16:30] who has believed our report
[1:16:35] this was the prophet isaiah who was
[1:16:37] crying
[1:16:38] who has believed our report he was a
[1:16:42] prophet
[1:16:43] the murphys of god
[1:16:46] god's messenger what report was he
[1:16:49] talking about
[1:16:51] the word of god who has believed our
[1:16:54] reports
[1:16:56] to whom is the hour of the lord revealed
[1:17:01] thank you jesus
[1:17:04] whatever seed god has sown
[1:17:08] that is the seed god is coming for
[1:17:12] praise be to god
[1:17:27] and before the foundation of the world
[1:17:30] the seed god sold was of himself
[1:17:37] and god is not going to come and harvest
[1:17:40] anything that is not of him
[1:17:43] it must be the word the word on two feet
[1:17:51] it must be the word on the word
[1:17:57] precept upon precept yes
[1:18:01] any other thing would not work
[1:18:07] it must be exactly the same
[1:18:12] god is coming for must dovetail
[1:18:16] it must dovetail
[1:18:19] with who god is
[1:18:22] it must be a part of him
[1:18:27] anything less would not work
[1:18:31] and brother brother gave a very very
[1:18:32] wonderful story here beautiful story
[1:18:35] and i would like to read it and then we
[1:18:38] look at it
[1:18:43] thank you jesus in the old days
[1:18:47] when a contract was made you know what
[1:18:50] they did
[1:18:51] notice god just telling me to say this
[1:18:55] i don't know a person would go and write
[1:18:58] a contract
[1:18:59] on a piece of paper
[1:19:02] they'll write the contract and then on
[1:19:05] the contract
[1:19:06] they are right what it was
[1:19:10] they was going to do then they had
[1:19:13] teared the paper into two
[1:19:15] and they would kill a beast
[1:19:19] and over this beast tore the contract
[1:19:23] they would give one person one and
[1:19:26] one part the passing the other
[1:19:30] and when they come together when this
[1:19:33] agreement
[1:19:34] was brought together
[1:19:37] that had to be exactly the same piece of
[1:19:40] paper
[1:19:40] cut through the letters and had to
[1:19:43] dovetail
[1:19:45] just exactly that's right with that
[1:19:48] or the contract was no good that's right
[1:19:52] see the agreement was no good
[1:20:00] i believe these are a brother one
[1:20:04] there's a lot of anointing in this order
[1:20:10] praise be to god
[1:20:13] yes wherever the corona came and met
[1:20:18] as the current of go and leave us
[1:20:21] we are children of god praise be to god
[1:20:25] yes
[1:20:31] the same piece of paper that was thrown
[1:20:33] away had to come
[1:20:35] right back to dovetail
[1:20:38] in with the order like that to make it
[1:20:41] perfect
[1:20:43] and then as they are pledge they
[1:20:46] killed a beast when they made their
[1:20:49] pledge
[1:20:50] now god made a contract
[1:20:53] with the peoples of this world therefore
[1:20:56] he sent his son
[1:20:58] he sent the son of god and killed him on
[1:21:01] calvary
[1:21:02] you believe that amen all rely sheep
[1:21:07] have gone astray god laid upon him
[1:21:11] the iniquity of us all he was wounded
[1:21:14] for our transgressions
[1:21:16] bruised for our iniquities that the
[1:21:18] statement of our peace was upon him
[1:21:21] which is stripes we are healed that was
[1:21:24] god's contract
[1:21:25] to the church is that right then
[1:21:28] god killed the lamb at calvary
[1:21:32] do you believe and from him he tore his
[1:21:36] he tore him apart he took
[1:21:39] part of it the body
[1:21:42] up into glory set it on the right hand
[1:21:47] of the majesty you believe it
[1:21:50] the holy spirit he is sent back
[1:21:53] to the people is that right then when it
[1:21:57] comes together
[1:21:58] when this contract is come together
[1:22:02] at that day of judgment the same holy
[1:22:05] spirit that fell on the day of pentecost
[1:22:08] is grouping around a bunch of people
[1:22:11] till go right back to that same body
[1:22:15] to dovetail right into that same body
[1:22:20] is a contract so therefore the spirit
[1:22:24] that was in that day is here today
[1:22:28] the same signs wonders miracles are
[1:22:30] being
[1:22:31] performed the same people are believing
[1:22:35] in the same manner praise be to god
[1:22:38] and the prophet of god said now
[1:22:42] the first thing you must do is surrender
[1:22:46] yourself entirely to christ
[1:22:49] and surrender your mind to him
[1:22:53] to his word lord i won't act
[1:22:57] upon my own feelings upon my own
[1:23:00] thoughts
[1:23:01] i will only act upon your word
[1:23:04] i will have no control of my own
[1:23:06] thoughts concerning it
[1:23:08] i will act according to your word now
[1:23:10] get it straight
[1:23:12] praise be to god the prophet of god
[1:23:14] talking about this contract
[1:23:20] to tell you the seriousness of the
[1:23:22] contract
[1:23:24] that a beast had to be killed
[1:23:28] and the pilots to the contract had to
[1:23:31] stand over the dead body
[1:23:32] of that beast to make their agreement to
[1:23:36] take their off
[1:23:38] and what were they saying that if
[1:23:42] i do not keep my sight of the contract
[1:23:45] i should be like this beast
[1:23:52] but so long as i keep my side of the
[1:23:54] contract
[1:23:55] and you keep your side of the contract
[1:23:58] there is no cause
[1:24:00] to shed blood because a blood has been
[1:24:03] shared already
[1:24:06] yes thank you jesus praise be to god
[1:24:10] thank you and the power of god said that
[1:24:12] god has a contract
[1:24:14] with his church
[1:24:17] thank you jesus the church
[1:24:21] is the body of christ christ
[1:24:24] is the head of the church now as the
[1:24:27] power of god
[1:24:28] said that the contract was turned into
[1:24:31] two
[1:24:32] and each party was keeping aside a part
[1:24:35] of it
[1:24:36] the church is keeping one side of the
[1:24:39] contract
[1:24:41] and the head is keeping one side of the
[1:24:43] contract
[1:24:45] so there is no way that the contract can
[1:24:49] ever be complete
[1:24:51] without the two sides coming back
[1:24:52] together
[1:24:54] and when they come back together the
[1:24:57] texture of the paper
[1:24:59] must be the same the size of the paper
[1:25:03] must be the same the color of the paper
[1:25:06] must be the same the print
[1:25:09] must be the same and when they are
[1:25:12] brought together
[1:25:13] the worst and the letters must tally
[1:25:15] together
[1:25:18] thank you lord praise be to god
[1:25:22] the church is the body of christ
[1:25:26] without the head the body is incomplete
[1:25:31] christ is the head of the church
[1:25:34] and without the body he is incomplete
[1:25:41] he has one side of the contract the
[1:25:44] church
[1:25:45] has the other side of the contract
[1:25:51] and the holy spirit is here
[1:25:55] to make sure
[1:25:58] that we are walking a fine line
[1:26:04] that we are keeping to the statues
[1:26:08] that we are obeying the lord's command
[1:26:11] that we are doing what we are supposed
[1:26:13] to do as children of god
[1:26:15] that we are not led by our feelings and
[1:26:17] by our emotions
[1:26:19] we are led by the spirit of god for the
[1:26:22] children of god are led by the spirit of
[1:26:24] god
[1:26:26] praise be to god thank you jesus and
[1:26:28] what is the holy spirit doing
[1:26:30] the holy spirit is just keeping us in
[1:26:33] line
[1:26:34] to make sure that we are keeping our
[1:26:36] side of the contract
[1:26:40] praise be to god because he is keeping
[1:26:43] his side of it
[1:26:44] yes the problem has always been the
[1:26:46] church
[1:26:47] the problem has never been with him
[1:26:50] because he will do whatever he has
[1:26:52] promised he will do
[1:26:53] thank you the problem is always with the
[1:26:56] church
[1:26:58] thank you that is why the holy ghost
[1:27:01] baptism
[1:27:03] is a must yes
[1:27:08] if there is anything we ought to be
[1:27:11] praying for
[1:27:12] by day and by night crying and seeking
[1:27:16] god
[1:27:17] is the holy spirit
[1:27:23] that when the spirit of god comes into
[1:27:24] your soul
[1:27:26] you know that you know that by the grace
[1:27:30] of god
[1:27:32] you are saved
[1:27:36] that when the head comes down to unite
[1:27:39] with the church
[1:27:42] if you are the letter b you are going to
[1:27:45] be
[1:27:45] you are just going to unite exactly
[1:27:47] where you're supposed to be yes

[1:28:44] a mighty tower
[1:28:45] the righteous running to reach and it's

[1:29:14] praise the lord jesus whose report
[1:29:16] should we believe
[1:29:17] whose report are you believing
[1:29:21] there are a lot of voices that are
[1:29:23] calling for attention
[1:29:25] whose report are you believing christ
[1:29:38] came to die
[1:29:39] so we should leave
[1:29:43] he was the lamp that was turned apart
[1:29:47] when that contract was made
[1:29:50] to tell you how serious that contract is
[1:29:54] to keep your side of the contract is
[1:29:57] life
[1:29:59] and not to keep your side of the
[1:30:01] contract is death
[1:30:06] the lord who have believed our report
[1:30:12] that is why i don't care anything
[1:30:15] anybody says about the prophet
[1:30:18] i don't care what they say he has done
[1:30:21] his work
[1:30:23] like the bulldozer he came
[1:30:26] and he cut on the trees of the
[1:30:28] nomination
[1:30:30] there isn't a dogmas and what have you
[1:30:32] he cut them down
[1:30:33] i printed the storms level the hills
[1:30:36] filled the valleys he's done with his
[1:30:40] weight
[1:30:40] he is gone the success
[1:30:44] story of the church depends on what the
[1:30:48] prophet came to do
[1:30:51] outside of what the prophet did there is
[1:30:53] no victory
[1:30:55] outside of what the prophet did there is
[1:30:56] no success outside of what
[1:30:58] prophecy there is no life the success
[1:31:02] of the church today the victory of the
[1:31:04] church today
[1:31:05] depends on what god sent the prophet to
[1:31:07] come and do
[1:31:11] he has lived his life
[1:31:17] i don't care if the bulldozer was
[1:31:18] working on one leg
[1:31:21] i don't care whether the color was
[1:31:22] yellow whether it was green
[1:31:24] whether it was brown i don't care
[1:31:27] i don't care whether it was toppled in a
[1:31:29] valley or it was taken by a crane
[1:31:32] i don't care what i care about
[1:31:36] is the work and the foundation that they
[1:31:40] lead praise be to god
[1:31:44] thank you jesus i don't read
[1:31:49] i just don't some i just look at the
[1:31:51] caption
[1:31:52] there i don't worry there are a lot of
[1:31:54] battles i'm fighting
[1:31:55] i don't want to add to it
[1:32:01] anything they want to say they are free
[1:32:04] to say it
[1:32:05] i am not compelled to believe it
[1:32:09] make sure you get a hold of god
[1:32:12] and it's even better when god gets ahold
[1:32:14] of you
[1:32:15] because if it is you getting ahold of
[1:32:17] god to what extent can you hold on
[1:32:21] you get tired and you want to live but
[1:32:23] if it is god
[1:32:24] has taken a hold of you when you are
[1:32:27] tired
[1:32:28] and you let go god will say keep you
[1:32:30] there
[1:32:31] praise be to god because god
[1:32:35] is the one that has gotten a hold of you
[1:32:38] let god get ahold of you
[1:32:42] praise be to god
[1:32:46] let them say whatever they want to say
[1:32:49] let them believe whatever they want to
[1:32:50] believe but one thing i know
[1:32:54] that we were predestinated unto this
[1:32:56] message
[1:32:59] nobody can tell me otherwise
[1:33:03] there is no way i can believe it
[1:33:08] god forbid that after having come this
[1:33:12] far
[1:33:13] would she turn our back
[1:33:17] and if you ever do it something in you
[1:33:21] would always tell you that this word is
[1:33:24] the truth
[1:33:24] nothing but the truth
[1:33:28] and you will never have any negative
[1:33:31] thing to say
[1:33:32] about this message because you know that
[1:33:35] it is the truth
[1:33:40] praise be to god we are grateful
[1:33:43] to the almighty god for what he has done
[1:33:46] for us
[1:33:48] that we have found favor in the sight of
[1:33:50] god
[1:33:51] yes we are products of grace
[1:33:55] when i look myself in the mirror i see
[1:33:57] nothing but grace
[1:34:00] anything people tell me that way this
[1:34:02] that i see nothing by the grace of god
[1:34:08] for by grace i is saved through faith
[1:34:12] not of works lest any man should boast
[1:34:16] we are counting on the grace of god
[1:34:19] and he that has called us would never
[1:34:22] let us down
[1:34:24] praise be to god remember
[1:34:29] that you have one side
[1:34:33] of the contract
[1:34:37] and you are duty-bound
[1:34:41] you are duty-bound
[1:34:44] to fulfill the terms of the contract
[1:34:48] because he is duty-bound to do his
[1:34:51] portion
[1:34:54] praise the lord and remember

[1:41:03] but one he says as i asked a question
[1:41:06] and he gave the answer to the question
[1:41:09] now you think about it now like this you
[1:41:12] know just
[1:41:12] as brother dan was closing there as
[1:41:15] beginning to start to think about it
[1:41:17] that way
[1:41:20] he says who believe the arm of the lord
[1:41:23] who has believed our report the arm of
[1:41:25] the lord will be revealed
[1:41:27] and isaiah was a prophet so think about

[1:42:28] that's the evidence of believing the
[1:42:29] message
[1:42:31] it's not brother branham's picture it's
[1:42:33] not his heart
[1:42:35] it's not his bob becker i mean james
[1:42:38] trousers
