we want to thank god for all his goodness his grace and mercy upon us praise amen it's cool to see uh sister baby church this morning [Music] moses praise the lord [Music] amen we testified last week the accident that the lord saved our brother from but i don't know if it was much of a true testimony because to be a true witness you have to either see it or you know witness the scene of you know year from from the scene so we would just give maybe uh five minutes to bear moses and he can come and testify he's we'll be hearing from the hershey's mouth himself praise the lord so come about moses before we change the order of our service here [Music] amen [Music] why this is not my first experience of going through accidents i think since i took on the cross back home and here i have gone similar accident more than five times and everything i walk put out and all the cars beyond repair but sometimes when you are on the front line for god and you become fearless general sometimes you become the target in my own where i came from there have been no church and no mass since that time was established nobody worship anything beside worshiping their rivers and trees my magical father was like the prince he worshiped snake at that time he took us to the snake he worshiped and made sacrifices when i was growing up so when god called me there have been a lot of opposition for church going through our culture and without no fear and even willing to die for the cost church is there right now people are worshiping and before i had an accident a few gram relatives that we had a conflict misunderstanding because of some of the principles doctrines we believe in as christians especially taking my girl's children to sunday butch they want to initiate my gosh into the sunday butch and it is against the culture to explain so i told them that if i want to do female mutilations i better prefer them to go to the hospital than to take the in the culture and that was complete violation of their faith to expose that so then on a struggle so god revealed to me and i sent the dreams two weeks ago what was going to happen to me so i was coming from work by 11 and on that day i was playing on music in the car called you told your girl and my god told me you carry a gun and my god carry me that's amazing i'll play in the car and right around here while i was coming i saw a suv jeep coming from the street controlling this main uh avenue but i saw a light in his car but all i thought that he came to stop because he needed to stop before getting on the avenue but just reaching the only thing i remember was and i saw the lightning and the next thing i saw that i was in a bubble you know what i call bubble right like millions of balloons or just fill the car that's all i can remember and after that the doctor was just asking me i was thinking i said but what's happening before they showed my pictures and stuff like that uh so the movie i like me to shake because you're thinking about my spinal cord and stuff like that so they killed me through all the x-ray everything i know ems or what kind of stuff put me through this type of stuff so just to call it shot the doctor king told me guess what i said what he said it just looked like the way your mother born you nothing happened so i said god has done it again so she asked me who are you i said i'm a christian he said god bless you because i never see shows as accident and no wound no bruise so i just want to give god the glory [Applause] and that's brother moses that's not even uh that is just a little piece out of the the aspect that the people will say amen amen we're having a few prayer requests this year let's let's stick there this morning [Music] i said i was going to let us know what we'll be doing easter weekend we have brother ben nero from tennessee that will be ministering for us he will come with his wife's sister semeta that will be with some [Music] singing and preaching for us that weekend so we will we will have a friday night in a saturday evening and a sunday morning service [Music] so we might not have a wednesday service but as we get closer we will keep reminding ourselves so there will be a friday night a saturday evening and a sunday morning service for brother ben and praise the lord our brother joel the young brother joseph that used to be with us moved to dc because of work uh spoke to him in a week last week his dad is staying there well and has now been diagnosed with lungs cancer so he acts that we pray for his father and also pray for him he's preparing to travel home to see his dad praise the lord a prayer request here sister beer asks that we pray for her she have an unspoken prayer request so we will leave that up to the lord as well and this is from brothers care please pray for a friend of mine vincent hopley he is a brother in christ he has steadily gotten weaker in the years until he can't lift his arm above his weights the doctor think he might have a so whatever that abbreviate we're going to bring it under the bloody man praise the lord so we just want to take those needs to the lord let's buy our house together and if there is any non-spoken prayer requests in the house this morning let's just pray as we bring these knees bring brother joseph dad and sister beer and this friend of brother's cat to the foot of the cross this morning [Music] heavenly father lord jesus a church of the living god purchased by your blood father we unite our faith this morning we bring our hearts at the altar lord jesus dear lord we want to remember this need we pray for brother sonny this morning father back in nigeria oh god and we just asked the father you you are the great physician lord even father before the doctor

o god we love you we love you we appreciate you father thank you sweet jesus in your wonderful name we pray amen i sing because oh yes i said because i'm free [Music] is [Music] because i'm happy oh yes i say because i'm free [Music] praise the lord we just want to be grateful and thank the lord for everything he's doing and this week i was uh now to see it a little bit under the weather not on the weather but i just got so tired from from the service last week sunday praise the lord and i wanted to read a quote that i sent out there and let me see if i can take that up here you know brother branham shared this and he said praise the lord amen you love the lord praise the lord he's a wonderful wonderful lord jesus and we we love him glory be to god he said is in the message what is a vision and he said now when jesus raised lazarus from the grave it was more it was more of a miracle than what the woman that touched his garment and was healed with the blood issue you were made there he never said one word about getting weak and virtue going out of him because god was using his gift in as much as both of them was a miracle you know lazarus came from the grave after being dead four days but he raised lazarus from the grave on the vision god revealed to him you know the lord told him not to go at the time lazarus was sick you know because the death of lazarus was going to be to the glory of god so god already told him what was happening so he went and then uh you know he he raised lazarus but it was different with the woman with the blood issue it was her face you know she said it in her heart i know if i touch the arm of his garment i will be healed so brother branham was saying one it was god's using the gift and the woman touching jesus it was the woman that was operating the gift because it was the womb of faith that was reaching out for healing with the raising of lazarus it was god that revered to jesus that larger was going to come from the grave and nothing could stop it praise the lord but the the thing about it there is the other when he raised lazarus from the from the grave he never said that you left him but when the woman used the gift he did not have strength because that's you left him amen and uh [Music] so but when people use the gift of god that's what makes me weak he was referring to the healing ministry now so on the platform as you yourself and that's and and that's what is doing it you yourself is working uh the operation and and that's the reason it's pulling true is either you are using god's gift or god using his gift amen whichever way the gift of god is going to be yours praise the lord but for some reason i was just so out of faith during the week if you notice me wednesday night evening i was i was a bit tired yesterday i was just honored a very strong headache and so i need your prayers pray for me as i do the same for you and so brother joseph will speak to us this morning he will bring the word let just stand on our feet and and we will sing a song and ask our brother to come and bring the word this morning and [Music] praise the lord and i was thinking about us sinking this song i'm just a sinner saved by grace [Music] let's just worship the lord [Music] he took my place now i live in breathing freedom now i live and breathe in freedom [Music] through his precious love and forgiveness [Music] see let's sing that one more time i was so sick save my grace [Music] my live and breathe in freedom through his breasts [Applause] [Music] back with [Music] yourself you can come [Music] nothing one musician they are playing softly let us all of us pray for the service let us surrender all of us in his presence praise the lord father god [Music] we appreciate you we give you glory and honor other people they came from home from work they come to your presence this morning or father father we've got burdens some they are sick some they got a problem oh father the solution is you we are in the presence of the one who gives solutions we are in the presence of the one heal the sick we are in the presence who the one answers prayers we are in the presence who the one protect brother moses in the accident we are in the presence with the one here five thousand the people in their band one day seven trucks father of crutches miracles we are in the one who created the sun the moon even if the devil hallelujah lord god help us just to forget ourselves this morning lord help us father just to get to use but to just get to loose in your presence as the pastor said that sunday to us you preaching we are drawing from you through him he was exhausted those kind of preaching those kind of of a presence we needed wrong the word is so statues so darkness whether we need sometimes we can feel your presence in our midst it's not to have a habit every sunday every every sunday every wednesday to go to church no father we must always expect something from your every services this is your services put me aside father bless the world bless father the pastor of the church bless all deacons bless father everyone who is in his presence father we need you this morning lord i don't want to preach to them i don't have something to do father in me there is nothing good but you if you can help me to step out and take control of the service father this service will be wonderful beautiful because you take control the control of god we invite your father is the sick lord also the prayer god oh thank you lord because you always answer prayer lord god that the service in your hand of

further the lord jesus praise the lord hey many many many man uh you know our god doesn't have a grainy oh the grainy grainy god have only children they are the children of god we are the children of

read the word then you can sit enjoy your seat but don't sleep please don't sleep praise the lord i don't i'm not kind of preacher that you know people are sleeping i continue i just feel like let me make you sleep you know okay i greet all in the name of the lord jesus christ i thank the pastor to trust me to stand in the front of the puppet is not the easier job there is no one is a profession here puppet i was thinking i was only alone feeling that five minutes time before you come here you shaved you can beat i have 10 years preaching missionary judges big churches smaller but when you have to come behind you feel like something is like they they gave you a news like a funeral or your father is very sick you know how you feel you can't get you so i thought that means alone there is one person also 30 30 years of preaching he said the same thing i said wow this place we can't play with it that's why but said if you don't have experience of the holy spirit don't preach because the preacher is the lord jesus christ so we are trying just to create atmosphere and the hymn can take over i prefer if he can take over me i can step out and step in then it will be blessed god bless you richly let us read the word thank you for the song all those people they sing i really appreciate and they're my brother when you sing make me blessed i can sing but i always say god help me start singing because this brother and the sister she always sing oh and my wife she now she pick up she starts singing i know scott is happy i know he was smiling hallelujah praise god you know we we are the children of god yeah we are really watching i don't know i just want god to use me in another way if i prepare as a preacher anyone can preach but i just want him to use me another way i don't know which way but let us read the word then we can go today is sunday so who is going to work no problem you can just say okay we pray for you because i don't know if i'm going to finish it three or four i don't know it's a son praise the lord don't worry i'm not kind of someone can preach long don't skate thank you thank you so much okay let us read the word now i'm going to read on john 4 chapter 1 up to 26. i can jump i can just read one two and i can continue along i like you to read with me my accent sometimes you know we have to read together saint john and day 4 from verse 1 to 26 but you say over drinking of the world that i shall give him shall never trust but the word that i shall give him shall be in him a world of war us bringing up into everlasting life praise the lord the woman said unto him sir give me this horror that i first not neither come either to draw just said unto her go call thy husband and come either the woman answered and they said i have no husband just said unto her thou as well said i have no husband for thou has had five husbands and here whom thou now as he is not that husband is that said that thou trust truly the woman said unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet our father our father worshiped in this mountain and you say that jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship just say unto her oman believe me the how i commit when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet jerusalem worship the father you worship here no not what we know that we worship for salvation is of the jews but the the hour come at and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in the spirit in truth for the father secret as such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him as worshiping in the spirit in the truth the woman said unto him i know that messiah cometh which he called christ when he come he will tell us all things jesus said unto her i thought speaking unto thee am he shall we pray again father god thank you bless the scripture father take control the savior's father preached to us father you take left or right you what you prepare for us to listen to here to be blessed our father we come in your presence so father we need you oh god we have abundance we have problems we know father you are the one father you can give us a solution you can help us to understand the bible you can change our lives it's not our effort it's not uranth is not who do whatever but by the grace of god thank you jesus father we on completely surrender we pray in jesus christ's name we said amen maybe satan oh my small tower today i'll just type it worship god in spirit and in truth praise the lord if you don't finish we finish any other day i'm not someone who stick on my knot i love sometimes to go off not praise god amen amen clap the hand for the lord praise god praise god praise god thank you thank you so much i start first for the scripture i love this scripture oh you can see how god was speaking to the woman and it was not late it was on time god led her to have one two three four six number of men hallelujah glory be to god only seven he didn't want a man to take that number he was the seventh one came the husband ah cleveland for the lord hallelujah glory be to god it was the right time for that woman to receive a sight it was the time for god to speak to her and when god comes he come on time he'll never be late he doesn't come early he always come on time hallelujah sometimes the ambulance can come wherever they can stop those traffic lights they always come late the police they can come out they can stop what they like to stop or stop they always come late but there is somebody hallelujah i love him so much he never come late he always come on time lazarus was sick people they said this jesus he always go there to eat food they always cook for him you see i always tell you he refused did you call him yeah we sent someone what he said he said he continue you see he's running away because he doesn't want to pray for him before they can talk talk talk but when he come back it was for the glory of god you know sometimes that's why the bible said all things work together for good that scripture i don't know we just repeat it's just a say oh because the bible said sometimes scriptures must be materialized we are the spirit people when god created adam adam was a spirit that's the adam was equal with god he created him as a spirit and was controlling everything and he formed a body he put that adam's spirit in eternal form he brought him in the in the time of body then trouble came because when he was before he come in the flesh the devil couldn't touch him when he's in the body the devil's now see he starts to see clear he can know and he can touch but he tried him it couldn't because he was not by product when he saw a woman by product is it this one i can touch praise god god always on time everything comes for good i always tell my wife i said uh you know what whatever problem come to you at work in the family just try to found a benefit side of it and i love pasta one day i was saying sometimes people there some people they i always say him pastor they are using you you know pastor he said hey joseph yes you are so fast you're so he said anyone no matter how bad they can be there is always a good sign hello yeah that is it's a wisdom yeah it's a reason we say there is always that's why i said i can know someone is using me but i want to find a benefit but for him where i can have something i never see that way that's him and he had something and i took it as in my life i've learned and it helped me at work it's work most of the time you can see most of african they they want to gather you feel like they always want to work together even when they send me the first time or before i get used to to to work the managers they send me in the africans they can be americans or from overseas but to train me they feel me covered they say joseph are you okay they say i'm fine so i realized that when they said i said they don't know i'm a ego i am an ego i can manage everywhere when they asked me a shift i said i need the second shift the first one is the morning if there is no morning the second choice is the second shift and there is in second shift there is no african are you sure i say i'm sure they put them in the second shift they came after a week joseph are you okay as i'm very good more than that team i was a lot of people you know sometimes someone who can judge before you approach him don't judge before you approach him i always i'm sorry i always mention my wife because she's my friend i talk too much when my the same one is too much i preached to her hey wake up jesus said jesus said he said amen he was a good same one she's my puppet so i always talk to her like that yeah so most of the time i talk to her don't be offended when i mention i always talk to her when i'm praising she said amen someone said it was too much i'm sorry babe now i'm fine i float i'll float hallelujah yeah so i always tell sometimes we've got a habit of when someone gives you a information he will never tell you how it to start that if he was wrong or not he always tell what they told him or what he he received from other person he did this and what did you do before he started to do that my mom always have a problem with me your aunt you aren't your aunt my sister came here we must not go there we must just cut it barrier they are not i say hey come that she is a young sister as we are children when you do that when they fixed it will be difficult for you to fix then they can fix fast you have to know what happened no one is my mom i said mom tell me just stop the story start to relate [Music] ah no i just said you're wrong me your mother said but you're wrong you're not supposed to do that so i always are we me i will never take side when i didn't hear opposite side never that is making me a little bit a little bit wise in a problem yeah sometimes you don't take my side i can't i will never take the side until i hear another side you're my wife yes first i hear another side then i'll protect you as my wife you are wrong but you know adam he knew she was wrong she just fall because love but she knew that she was wrong yeah i want that to hear him oh we are wrong we are all of us wrong like i always said if she doesn't pay tight i pay tight it's that means she's dancing we don't pay tight that's that's the way i took if i pay she doesn't we don't that's the way i took that's the way i judge that's where i work because remember when there is a mistake of someone it costs all their family always it's because of the family that's why the brotherhood always he said that we must have a communication of your wife you must be closer you must be friend to succeed i'm telling you most of people they succeeded when they are friend with their wives even if the politicians you know obama the way he is if you see his story they see obama he brought the style of people they start even if to work with their wife with hand yeah people now they are they are comfortable most of the time people they live in africa they never go with their wife's president no the wife will be behind him is the president you're president of your wife he's around in the front the wife is following like a like helper praise god give them for the lord amen amen [Applause] this woman she found the opportunity she said i perceive you a messiah now i don't want to go that side of the second husband there's another preaching that let her put aside i want you to put attention the true worshipers worship the father in the spirit and in the truth that's where there is a many problem even in the assembly of the message you know where you are sitting there do you know that you are not you are you is inside of you you get used for this 16 element and you forget a real of you keep them for the lord [Applause] so if you start to train yourself to know area of you then you start to be strong that's why i don't judge people by seeing by church by tribe i judge people by my heart ah thank god because when i just met somebody oh we are connected god bless my brother and finish baby they can see his bodies i'm connected i don't know why we we can't stop it there's something it's a link yeah but what i'm saying some people they're good but you can't be comfortable to be among them and you can't force it you can't it's something you have to know that's why to judge you must be a spiritual also to judge right at work i met those people they said they were bad bad but that's the those people they teach me very good work than african i told my wife only one kick i mean i must have the machines one kick they would with love you can feel so i understand that it's because they judge by far and there's a problem of english it's not their first english some most they came from like puerto rico they came from you know neighbor countries here mexico it's like me it's by the grace of god i can preach in french in english is the grace of god english is difficult for us sometimes even if how are you they don't know any drc but the grace of god god sent me to south africa he teach me english he brought me his character and they brought me here then i can communicate in english and you are enjoying my english is clear right [Music] praise god praise god praise god so when you don't approach them you can judge wrong may i understand is english is a language they they feel comfortable when they speak their spanish you know and they feel nice but when you come how are you can you explain to me what that is you can even if you do do this it's like dictating you know they don't know if sometimes it's the english language i take that side ah like this this ah okay i know now i memorized this thing must be the left that one in the right and this is oh okay thank you is a good teacher and i'm going like that so you know information then when they come to me they said ah are you okay this is the best team ever this one huh are you sure yes that's the way i i exercise my christianity that's the way i live i don't preach things just to preach to feel to make you to feel good i love to preach my life that's me i love to preach in my life i like to preach what i'm going through that's why one day they asked me to to preach on the wedding in zimbabwe the elder they sit there i wasn't yet married then they said in the convention they can make the convention combined meeting i preach friday evening saturday morning evening saturday joins alone i'm preaching all the but when we reach marriage issue i don't have experience what can what can i tell them i don't just preach brother i refuse that the first time i refute the puppet people are sitting there hey sorry i can sing not this one i don't want to preach things that's why it doesn't bring life it doesn't help people because we preach things we don't know we don't have experience we never go through praise god we are the spirit people we are getting used to the physical that's why when you want to understand the message with your intellect with your spirit with your body you will always get wrong always that's why i always repeat this i don't know we will understand it's fine i can't explain i always tell you what random said i saw the third po wow so great so big that's why it was a silence but i must not say about it it's a reveal six it didn't reveal a seven but they asked a question it's not reveal seven say it's a reveal it was a reveal so tell me how i'm going to explain that people they want to these things you can't explain it it's a language it's you have to hit the target the mark it's not some there is no vocabulary to explain it there is no that's why you asked why you that's why i said well if you don't understand it didn't say ask have a good life pray go to church it's not even for everybody to understand it if someone says not reveal yes understand him is not revealed for him but it's revealed for you why are you arguing and the internet you are using there is a lot of evil and information there you must be careful when they are giving you they started to analyze cloud is not for them it's for you so why do you want to hear from them and which benefit they're going to help you when you hear their their google google know the cloud google not the third pool he doesn't know nothing about the cloud it doesn't have about the third pool it doesn't know about the angel nothing guru what is the cloud they're going to give you the wrong answer some people they ask google cloud they took the answer of the google out of the message if you need the proof in the message you'll prove out i'm telling you is there something you can't explain but it's real because the real few are the spiritual but the problem is explaining even if you bar yourself if we break we break we break is good to to invisible these bodies can be invisible we can vanish because you came from the invisible to the visible any of you is invisible clapton for the lord we believe in invisible that's where we came from in the body now to to catch this message you must be able to go back to the invisible then you can you can know any of you hey you sometimes want to say something he said i don't know if you are going to understand it and they said another way another way do you know that some people they were with branham those days they didn't even have the ability to understand the message like us this age do you know that because now everything is open we are in the sodomik atmosphere you can't even tell can you go to the surgery they choose gender it's open protected is there now we got people there is a church they worship brahmo god you can't help them they are there and those things you have to know they are there but the problem is what is your position you as a bride what is your position when you look the prophet you look him as like who how did you see a man they come to see jesus they stuck on the body because what that what they're not supposed to see they must see the invisible and invisible to sit must go to the ground to die and they will see more and the manifestation of them invisible even if you see it you can't sit with your eyes physically as these are spiritual eyes church let us go back that's why i always say surrender when i mean surrender it means you must just feel like you don't know nothing we don't know nothing until the one who knows everything enter in you if it's himself and you re believe his own word that's where we are we must reach level grab the head for the lord [Applause] because the word of god is powerful the word of god it's powerful because what you can see and the touch can it came from for what you can't see so what is the real the real is invisible make it put in because this but that's why i was calling this bar full of nonsense this body don't give anything she want it want this body full and it will never say thank you you're giving us food you need again what another suit this is what no if another one any airplane nothing nothing no sense no sense today you wake up you are okay tomorrow you are weak and now you are sick happy when you are happy and i want to notice when you wake up you feel like happiness you must go to pray before the day finish you'll be sad i always notice that when i'm happy start to pray god to protect you when that sadness will come you know that's the body so they real the worshiper they must worship in this truth and the spirit what is the truth the truth is the message of your time because you can even the spirit but with a pastor's message it will never help you it will never help you that's why when she hit the target she met the right one at the right time she was blessed and the right one said hey not jerusalem the father always like to worship him in the spirit and the spirit is another world the spirit that's why baba said you can create in your own world you know when you i'm gonna just give you a something you can practice when you start to have too much desire of the thing of the world automatically know your backslide that's only sign you know you're already down don't wait to be more stop start praying start to pick yourself up because paul said we make slide every day it means that it it becomes gradually now when it becomes a big gap now we see you check you become a problem you already started sliding long back hallelujah you didn't know the music you never like to hear you start to hear them they speak they gossip when people start to gossip you feel like you never like now you are enjoying it gossiping what's wrong my brother what's wrong my sister it means you already bex like don't wait your place is here kneel down we don't see people again in front of a puppy just pray and pray and cry and pray is what it doesn't mean he's a sinner no we want to be picked up we are not the professional in the world there is no one is professional all of us we are dealing with our staff everyone here and i'm gonna tell you something the message believe that they've got to attitude when a preacher preached said who wanted the holy spirit they're looking at their back you're the one at the back you need it do you know that someone with a holy spirit is third he always wants more more more you will never feel that it's enough it will never reach that level always down they want they want you to never when you feel you are enough you are already in a problem then we got a problem praise god hallelujah i didn't start it's okay let us read a first chord in the meanest man in santa maria paragraph seven and there been a shoe cover blind from up somewhere above i forgot the name of the serum now close to just borrow about 30 40 miles and it been blind for years and the holy sp holy spirit had pronounced him here and he went around come back in line again said you said sir i was healed my eyes are not open i said that is nothing to do with it you told me you believed me he said i do i said then why are you questioning me and so he said he went on i said just keep saying praise the lord for my side hallelujah and it was going home that morning i stopped first day before we continue there is a problem for a motto to believe a motto it's a that's where that's where we stuck because you must believe on me to believe to god that's the formula there is there is only ordained the people god or then with the gift to use is going to use them it gives them an element to preach you with that's the gift and that's why we always pray put me out of my way you enter in your gift that a gift it's a it's it it's it's a device it's application to make that device to work and when that is activated with the anointing with the life with the holy spirit god used that application to make that device to work and they connect to you because us we are not a preacher that's why we are s is like a preacher we are like the preachers the preacher is god himself but when i ask do you believe me he didn't say do you believe god everyone can say believe god the time you and how we are living is to believe men to cross and to see what is in the man because we hear with the ears we risen with this this this head you know the barrel ever thought is in your mind how many mind a human being think bidet do you know how many more than 60 000 thought what are you sitting there coming that's why we create atmosphere music music are very dangerous because the music conscience it can go straight to subconscious that's why you have to know which kind of music are you listening that person is a singing you've got a life of god or you just follow the beat i always tell my wife i said that's me if you don't believe this it's okay it's not the scripture i just think it's simple i know there's some unbeliever oh those pentecostals they sing a good song it's fine for me joseph i can take that song for domo and whatever but when a brother or a sister sing now the same song it become another song because it comes from you now there are no things from you now and you pray you surrender and we sing it i'm not a legalistic said don't don't even song no no no no no i don't me understand that way because when you take those words you start to sing because those are without the word a good word but the problem the one who's singing it that's the problem you you can take those words you pray you practice you sing you can bless us more than the one who wrote it come on church that's true they can be inspired with a good word but the problem is the life in the world there is a subname information go through the song through the preaching there is one brother since he believed the message in congo he was just holy you know that was fear of his holiness a prayer whatever he never followed a woman he was just always picked up spiritually fighting and when he came to south africa he didn't choose right to change come african sometimes it's okay but not me sometimes i just pray and go where i feel they were they constituted a lot of congolese it was the pictures all of them they beat the support room i came i spoke with the pastor five minutes i came out we are going to these churches i will never come to these churches why this pastor need god you are proud it's fine go i just give you three years or four you tell me i always go and see them when the musician comes the focus comes after three years and four it was breaking virginity of sisters in the church women often not yet and they are preaching a powerful and the people they were dancing and jumping the anointing oh god help us so after decide to come to how did you know i said i don't know i can't explain it why it can preach a good semen people they jump but when it's preaching it doesn't leave the message the life of the bible the message or whatever i can call it when it doesn't have the life of god the message is giving to you is what is is a sub no me no message that's why if these rappers they can wrap wrap rap they don't say anything but after listening that that that song they took the gun they didn't tell them to kill but there is a sub domino message in the music and when he went to the church he started he told me he said joseph when i come to the church i feel i have to i have to with the children you understand so he until he fall this first time he woke up he called his wife i love that brother because when he falls straight away call his wife he called that i did wrong forgive me my that's a christian some people they don't do that when they say you see they want to say you see dude seven times i don't know 10 he never confessed he's keeping hypocrite call your wife and confess that to the right way of confessed sin of adultery and you can pick up there is no is a champion of life there is no one when you fall that's the problem christianity it's he asked a christian and the christian is within the holy spirit when you make a mistake even if he's a child you have ability to say oh joy forgive me i didn't mean that you know brother brahman is praying even for small girls 17 years you okay i know you say you are believer but you is a hope you don't have a faith name can you take that channel yeah you see that small ra it's more rob can you just stain it then it he was trying to help the girl to have faith not to show how but the branham of god power no we've got power but we use it in the right way clear then for the lord that's why you have to challenge god don't fear challenge god when when you feel like you can't do it just be there if you have to die die and you won't die you protect god will never let you down i'm telling you when you let god i want to see you the hebrews you think like the hebrews they knew that's going to die as we can have even the holy spirit in the heart you can go in the fire they burn you maybe before even if you go in the fire god took you already these ages are the glorious your age we are living as we are better than them them god was above them they couldn't they couldn't enter their heart because of the blood of the animals but you and i were living in the same way mighty god can dwell in you come on change [Applause] then you they are going to die and they will have a word as a law by the law god came down he proved he was god my brother my sister where is that god in our midst what are we hiding what is our life what's going on today assemblies where is that god everyone must ask it's not about brother nobody joseph or preachers or brother scott whatever it's about you individual everyone have to ask where is that god of william branham where is that god who created a squirrel where is that god who healed 25 000 in devon south africa one day seven trucks come man it's the same today and forever we can't even forget the heel for convey you fear convey more than god hallelujah they asked me at work i said fine i can take but not now i don't feel comfortable to take cover vaccine now because i saw god is a busy healing even if unbelievable before they don't die cover like it was come people have been healing and healing they said it's okay if it become a law if you don't take it they're gonna spell it work it's okay i'll take it to nothing but i don't take it because i fear oh praise god clapton for the lord is about me it's about me i was exposed in a son's club i was exposed i was i was working and i stood in the sam's club i told them my god will protect all of you i challenge my god i said there is no one who received a coffee in sam's club they look at me don't worry quick i'm telling you no one until i left some scrap god is good is a real god it works because when they said i don't see one sister in two three weeks to two weeks i want a lady he said what happened oh covey issue what i told my god i said i want to say what is it for god what meaning of this and he came no i didn't have coffee he's my dad and they protect all of us because i never praise the lord i'm telling you god to protect all the company you know we are we are saving challenge him if you can protect your neighbor you can protect myself always said hallelujah if god wants me to go with convey i'll go with convey why are you fearing that's me not you up to you i just give you my testimony because god is more than able to protect you god is more than able to remove the problem he is what are we hiding but abraham said kill the philistines even if they are babies kill them because when they grow up there will be enemies babies they're gonna be cute they can be beautiful kill them everything animals for them don't hurt nothing because they will grow up what are you hiding hypocrisy racism tribes pride gossip when you're hiding when they touch you feel like they know when it will go up to bring more demons if you bring something in the church cloud [Music] hallelujah the same code brother brother lord for my side he was going home that morning about five o'clock been driven by i believe it was his son an old model a car going up the road and it was sitting in their back seat saying praise the lord for my sight his eyes come up come open just about the whole country and so he ran into the catholic church the morning which he had on the end of his game dwelling in around like this praising god for giving his side and when he went over in the methodist church hallelujah catholic to the middle east i love this and he was going to have him harvested i don't i don't care if you arrest me or not disturbing hallelujah the worship don't look like that would disturb anything but but it all clap the hand for the lord [Applause] the healing was there but the procedure was not right of the one who believed they told him to believe he didn't see and he came back you told me i'm going to believe when i said you believe me yes then just go and praise god there is a attitude attitude work a lot even for your pastor you can tell him pastor pray for me if you don't believe in him it won't help you that's the problem i want emphasizing believe in the men that's the difficult time we're living because people they don't believe easily in the man to seek god they want to believe in the snakes in the sun when god can't use the sun can't use the snake god use human being that's why you have to pray to to know to whom put your confidence i'm balancing you can't believe anyone in there anyhow with your child of god god will always help you to break through god will always help you to believe a right person if your attitude is good i always tell people sisters and brothers not get married until you remove your fashion of your wife or your husband you have in your mind if you want a husband that knows like joseph and they thought you would never have because i'm alone there is no another joseph you must say if someone you don't know hallelujah you don't remove your image even if it's a with one leg if it's just the one god if you reach that level you are ready to get married hallelujah glory be to god praise god [Applause] am i going brother ariel god bless you praise god i love that i love this brother i don't know i just love him so much praise god glory be to god amen amen just thank god praising god when you pray you have to praise god that's where god that's the way the devil is confused doesn't mean he's too sick he's up may you say how he brought yourself how are you i'm fine oh my oh something maybe you are not okay as if god deleted this pain don't want to find out trying to feel pain i'm fine you're in pain oh babe if god let this pen to come you know why and you know when these penis go out but i always tell her even god take me off stay with the message be a pastor for my children for my joseph junior david [Music] ah come on you feel good there hallelujah praise god the devil doesn't understand that language he doesn't confuse him when the doctor said i remember one sister in drc she went to the doctor they make exam all things they examine examine things i said i said i am a professional doctor i declare why do you declare doctor your wife will never have a baby you know sometimes ask guys we hmm so what can we do you can't do nothing just prepare not to have a baby this is the stood up no you are a liar don't touch me you are a liar i'm going to have a baby and you just standing listening to that nonsense she walk out praise god after one year she have got children now [Music] sometimes you have to repost don't absorb no sense no don't absorb no sense no i will tell my wife don't be negative i can't have nothing in my pocket as i'm a millionaire i'm very rich hallelujah praise the lord i'm very rich i'm very rich glory be to god amen amen praise god the devil does not send that language confuse him someone hates you love him try that's my power i always win by love when i forget like in sam's club i forgot hey one guy gave us tough time one day cry like a baby i said god i don't know what to do when i just keep calling a voice on me joseph oh this year what is your weapon it's my weapon why can you what do you forget as my opponent is always love then so what love him i'm telling you the following day i told him i love you me yes i love you [Music] oh this message is wonderful i know my mother in that church they always pray for god is going to kill your witch those which kill your your children god which killed us god is wondering so mama your pastor is wrong he pray for you you were sick i said yes god used his gift he didn't kill me god healed me through him yeah he didn't but he prayed i said he could use another person he's god heal me he's not a healer he likes god one thing i want to say because my mama let that that their pastor become like a god but they call him to me she want to meet like the seventh of god they've got that good plate in the house i said this is the good place to keep forward to meshi when he comes he said that pasta when he comes a good plate i said hey this good plate my father must eat in this good plate more than your pasta this is only your pastor my dad i want to tell my wife it was good to play to keep the i want when i came you put on the table i'm the one i must enjoy those good plate good plates in the house than anyone else yeah i'm the husband so the good attitude today good things all only preachers only yes we are under effect where you're servant you don't know that we're just we are saving you you are the boss sitting hello glory to god there is another way when this body wants to feel pride you break it down you are saving them god send you with a blood you know in the body i don't know in the fist who saved a servant you were sitting they invite you we are giving food that's another side of this there's nothing good but the one who give food is god i'm just a saving and when he's saving you just surrender me using you blessed when i feel like i'm doing it you will never will be sleeping good then for the lord praise god human being always stuck on the flesh always i give a simple example isaac want to get married abraham send eliezer elisa when rebecca are you going yes and eliezer start to explain who is isaac look like what he likes an evening always come up in the yard it's why and rebecca start every image of isaac and they carry eyes rebecca closer to isaac and who is that that question was he look like the one you told me oh yeah that's the same of the message our eliezer is brother brannam i can give you a quote if you want he said send me as a liaison to go and look for your rebeccas so there is a time you work for brother branham and the only one time brother branham said i saw the pillow fire alarmed it it left me to wet me from the tent you see the time where you must leave a brother branham to marry christ in the tank hallelujah that's the mystery of the message and when you marry christ you understand the bearer bran nam but when you want to leave abraham before you meet christ you lost that's the problem you lost people they fear they are nowhere and the people they took too much they are no way but the bride stay with the message and the messenger until they met him in the small tent and when you enter in that tent but abraham says i saw the third pool our message is indefinable that's why there is a power you can't explain it your mind your spirit your body we never understand and nona language is not even if angel language do you understand that even if the angel they don't know it angels are your workers you you always want to see angels they are your worker you are more than an angel you know good and you know wrong the angel will always be there nothing tempts them but you you know the devil he can come to you say hey you i was with god when we created you you have experience over six years but me i've experienced a fraternity for the lord that's why the language the vocabularies this is a certain version of seven times as a series people they don't understand because they want to understand if the memories the mind will you will never understand and when you understand it you just become humble because there is no language is an unknown language you become humble you love more god than before you you you can't explain but it's a real because there is a message in the message i repeat again there is a message in the message there is a first message it brought all this nonsense you put the net in the river it brings a separate it brings cargo but when you put in the show ground you choose a fish so why you mind for those of us pencil and cloud the internet criticize the cloud when bada barami said you see the nose you see the eyes is there your husband and they said it wasn't it was a smoke and you are there try to analyze what's wrong with you you are just private yourself for the blessing christ came to deliver you in a higher the revelation of seven thunders is a rio then when the seventies is a real you just surrender yourself in the lord that's my power deadpool one day by one of them said i fell i wanna pray for this i love this god i felt the moving within me he didn't use the mach 16 oh yeah what did the devil play fox's thing because max has seen anyone can use it but the fed poo the bride only i'm telling you you are so powerful when i say we are modern illuminati you look at me like you don't understand we have a god who create the moon we create the oceans who create everything universe is right in your heart why are you looking at me like that you don't believe that our power is the highest power in the world don't the devil can touch you god allow him when he touch you said don't glorify yourself god allow you it will finish and even if you have to go ask your ego ah pain god is the time okay if i finish my work i go you go why do you want to go because you don't know where you go are you not sure where you are going why fear why fear not the little flock stand still no i am god follow here we are the egos not sickness can put us down not job no to money whatever money sometimes there is one brother he decided to work for god he left the job he started to work for god god said god i'm gonna send in the prison oh you see oh god sometimes when you ask things you must be ready you don't always go to send you in the prison he went there he was driving a car the car broke down he put the kite the police and they asked i checked the car and they took him and daka was for the bandit people they come for stealing the car but when they were driving i heard they saw a road block those people just stopped the car they ran away yes i'm not going to run away i don't know what's going on the police came you i said no let me explain i asked just people to help me where is yoka they want the police they investigate it's okay but those police they keep his contact after two years one police call him perhaps do you remember this is i said yeah yeah yeah yeah oh just come to the court and justice fight yeah i can come no problem my brother my sister when he just went to court the case changed 25 years in the prison people they don't understand the pastor all the people the elders in south africa they join together try to put the brother out no one could understand he went right in the prison he said god when we when he just entered first in the car in the in the truck when they were taking i just be short the story is long that when they were taken to the prison in the truck when they want to touch him one guy didn't know him he said hey you guys don't touch this man he's the man of god he look at him this man doesn't know from the truck they protect him to the prison when he's a prisoner he said this man we don't touch him he's the man of god he didn't understand when he just entered in the prison he come when he just entering one brother one is not brother he wasn't he was not a believer he said thank god i just thank the lord you look at him i was praying i have to be converted all my family are in the message i'm the one so i was stealing and the killing now i want to be a christian thank god you have to baptize me someone was praying in the prison and they i'm telling you god is god i just want to tell you how god can operate can work is whatever wrong comes you you just diabolizes demons whatever no sometimes we need the witches in our midst i always said so we need them yeah they sit there and we don't know if they're going to heaven if they don't want to repent it's up to them but we love them and which is if you are here just bleach me no problem and you see god i don't care you know what witches we let them be here dude i challenge them they will never do nothing to me i don't know to you i travel in the villages witches i challenge them and say hey guys together come tonight i'm around you'll see god of abraham isaac jacob god of william branham now is god of joseph mushota my god is going to fight you it become a mine take it to be yours that's that's the formula of the message don't leave only god of them with the brother branham or pastor priest no take him to be your god and you can say also my god is right here the pill of fire is right here god loved that and the devil hated that hallelujah clapton for the lord [Applause] the brother show to the story the brother entered the prison i'm telling you the brother just after two weeks he understood that god brought him in the prison and he started to preach you know how many souls confessed in the prison hundred in the prison it was a revival some people they were just reading the spoken word they read it was that they were having that he was having a spinal cord problem he couldn't really wake up what he was reading you feel the pain put down what if i read i reach these places when babanam is praying for people for sick and if i read i feel pain i say don't stop come let us continue to read they read together is heard until today so it was a miracle in the present now guess what it was convicted for five 25 years seven that's my numbers three five seven i love those numbers that's right now hallelujah even if when i'm meeting my wife knows three if we put four i put five let me put six i put seven you know when i was put to quotation if i'm not going to read oh it will stop on the sixes and always there is a seven seven that's me it's like a joke that's my life god work in the numbers oh come on church seven years in the prison he was convicted for 25 but the seven years the number of god accomplishments hallelujah oh seven years they just come for bob's your case was wrong come babs you must

meeting tenth mirroring and the involving accident they involved an accident accident because protective protection now he means wife i think last year they left oh that bob got the testimony when he's preaching people are crying can you imagine and the anointing and he stood up the message i'm telling you god is wonderful our god is a real the problem with us sometimes we we keep baby philistines i emphasize day and we forget why we are spiritual don't look to the symptoms start praising the lord and confessing the good am i hurt i'm rich i'm healed i'm rich you want me to give a scripture and matthew i'll give you houses and the land it doesn't mean when you're a christian you must be poor no no problem said the in the christianity there is a lot of amount of poor people and there is a few amount of rich people within my wife in that few reach for a rich people are in that field i've chosen that one to help a missionary to help the children of god to help my motives to

took all the money they give they build the church they start to go on foot to work and to school children three months only they both trick us you know when you invest church i don't know i don't

devil god put principle if you want to be rich richest is in you if you are to be poor poverty is you what you choose to be you'll be this message everything is there but the problem is a motive if you want to be rich for what or you want to see your sister list to see messages because it's driving under god will never give you the messages is a motive what why are you asking that man for what for for someone to see you for what the problem is a motive associate god with what you're doing associate god with what you're doing in your work is god's work my wife she's for god my children are for god myself we are for him for him alone no god assist you hey brother work nice walk walk like a human being what's wrong and that one bride you know next falling so if bride comes you must pray fast because falling is coming you must feel always connected always amber always you know sometimes in africa in you know in america yes but you can ask and africa you can preach all the churches are up big churches thousand three thousand they are up you finish all of them kneel down crying yeah i don't know maybe the food we are eating so heavy to say amen we with amen i don't know glory be to god that's why me grab your hand give me your hand clap your hands clap your hand praise god and your body start to tell you you see how you preach say no it's not me when did the body start to disturb me i took a broom i started to sleep hallelujah i'm going to save her she's sitting my baby yeah i'm just like this bad to feel you are nothing it is my friend she's the daughter of god i must treat her right she's working she she's tired so you have to see those things she's only because this is a wife she must do whatever no no no put yourself in her position praise god hey many many many men that's a way to succeed you know wife they can help you to succeed or to not succeed they are powerful don't don't underestimate them they are very powerful this is how you see them quietly they don't preach [Applause] praise the lord amen amen amen by the idea of god they use their power to the glory of god hallelujah praise god that's why when they're in the church they can pray that atmosphere change fast yeah they can be closer to god faster than men you know that yes sir that's because they are the bride and the bride you know our bridegroom where i am cleveland for the lord hey man praise god praise god praise god oh glory be to god i just didn't stop yet okay let me start glory be to god god bless you brother wonderful when i saw you there i feel good good atmosphere praise the lord hallelujah praise the lord those are good warriors i can cross in the hard time praise god it can go through hard time i can read it i look at him i just say god help my brother you know sometimes you don't need to ask you don't i don't know sometimes i don't i just said god bless you i just said go to help my brother you can feel the pain you can feel his crossing but he's trying and when he asks he when he open his testimony was he's going through he's more than what you going through maybe he doesn't want to say it you just trust in the lord so sometimes it takes some just to fellowship encouragement you feel released sometimes even if the word the people you know ask are you all right yeah it's working shop yeah i'm fine thank you for asking it's they release pressure that's why communion sometimes is good communion if you feel like just two three questions sometimes it's okay because you are living in the pressure there is a cloud darkness it's corrupted that's why babanami used to like to go and pray in the bush because atmospherity is a little bit good done in the town spirits it's a fight that's why when you have to come to church come to church sister brother yeah let us sing let us get you loose let us clap the hand let us sing why because this body we never like prayer when you want to watch movies it's ready three hours you become in the movies ah you see this is are you coming the spirit of the move can you say let us pray ah pastor also like prayers huh the body now when the body doesn't feel like do it there is a blessing i'm telling you don't wait to feel like no ways when you don't feel like do it do it and when you pray there is a blessing praise god god is a spirit the true worshipers must worship him in the truth and in the spirit then god uses people always use people so when god is using people that's why when we pray i love the prayer of the brother i was just following him i saw god thank you help us one brother pray bro stephen hood god bless you brother that's a wonderful prayer help the preacher to step out that's why i'm trying just i can read but when you pull i just leave even if i don't read everything it's okay he may have to lead me i don't want to stick on my knot because when he lead me you are blessed because he knows cleveland for the lord hallelujah where's god second call brother let us read now as i pray for the sick i want each of you out there to be to be aware of this that the holy spirit i don't know if this watch is a real watch or you didn't change it i wanna know it's 2 twelve maybe he's one my god i'm still running i thought that has two every one hour oh i'm sorry give me just me 15 minutes are you okay i'm sorry i was watching i just see that actually bridge more than 15 minutes i don't like to go like okay it's okay just give 15 minutes i'll finish god bless you for giving 15 minutes yes praise the lord hey amen amen all things went together for good it was for good praise god amen i just love you so much god bless you literally brethren there is a good atmosphere i don't know church we are going somewhere i can i can feel it you are pulling it's not the way i used to when i put that the first wednesday it's like i was struggling now i don't struggle i want to read you pull me that way just to make our pasta tired please pull a little bit oh yeah cleveland for the lord praise god you're using the gift that's true and you make the preacher tired the veg is going out okay now as i pray for the sick i want each one of you out to be to be aware of this that the holy spirit is right out over this audience tonight to heal anybody that's in the audience now this may be a little different from that you see of brethren pray for the sick i can only do as god tells me to do i can only say as he says for me to do and if i tell the truth then god will testify that after the truth now what i am afraid of is this dear friend what i'm afraid of as it was back there it have to be that way because when our mass when moses came many refused moses because he was a man when jesus came men many of them refused jesus because he was a man said him being a man make himself equal with god now it was god manifested in the flesh so there is there will be ordained certain things to be done and then it's so hard sometimes for people to see that because a man said so he said i'll do a work in the last days though a man bring it they will not believe it that's right that's the spiritual how many knows that's scripture he do though a man will bring it speak it now it's hard the hardest things that god ever gotten to to do all had to do was to get one motto to believe another you believe anything almost but a one person believing another that's a hard thing and i i've just thought this for years i've tried ever since i've been out to stand back and try to keep out of the picture just as much as i probably could so they would see the lord jesus see stand back and i want you now to look to what i'm pointing to not because i'm telling you this that the angel of the lord how many see the picture of its back there at the counter let's see your you should see it i wish i could afford to get them and give them everyone to you just about cost us what we got on there and they will be glad if you can get it we just a very few of them left that we have explained about the angel the pill of fire you know even if abraham was struggling for people not to see him to point them to christ that's that's the hardest because you have first to see god in the man and they can come to you so we have a malachi 4 we've got all our boxes it's a box of if everything when we open there is healing there is eternal life that everything is there but the one who brought malakai for is the angel the one who preached malachi 4 is the angel but the brahm is the vessel god uses that's why he always said if i can succeed to get out of my picture to get out he can step in then you can see jesus i've tried to pull to him and he said god if you bring the people to believe you you see how tricky things are if you bring the people to believe you even a cancer even if healing it's it's to you to believe a man you to see god in the man then that's why worship must have a revelation you can't worship without revelation those people they start a church without revelation they're baptizing in the father son holy spirit because jesus said so but when we have a revelation the revelation of a father son of the spirit is the lord jesus christ is a revelation the message are revealed for the age but you need a personal revelation to be connected to that link and when eliezer is brought into christ when you match christ you must be able to left branham out you marry the lord jesus christ clear then for the lord that's the formula you can't kick him out you can't take him in the bedroom the bedroom is a husband and wife is abide by a bright groomer and when you marry christ you will never forget about the jesus because he show you christ and when you have a confusion you just believe what eliezer told you to believe you don't need to explain when he said they said he's revealed you don't need to explain you have a healing believe you don't have it explained you are a bride of christ to believe you don't even explain it the cloud is the christ the believer you don't need to explain everything is with its ability revered we have the prophet even the camp we have a pill of fire in the camp that god of malachi 4 he must be allowed here we must have a healing we must have a solution we must have a transformation we must have god of william branham to heal us to bless us to give you what we want we more than conquer us the greater than
