father for tonight and we are so grateful for your presence lord in jesus name amen praise be to god [Music] while we are still standing musicians god bless you and i'll be offered to i mean for this moment well we are so standing can we get out take our bibles and turn to hebrews hebrews 6 18 and 19. hebrews 6 18 and 19. that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both shear and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil praise be to god shall we be seated as the lord adds his blessings to the reading of his word amen good to see you all and um it's been a very rough week for some of us but i know in it god has been very very faithful to us and now we can always trust that at every given time when we are expecting god to deliver he will deliver god would never disappoint his children praise be to god you should just be happy um the bible says they that live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution so just count yourself blessed if you are going through one persecution or the other sure you should be worried if your life is just smooth sailing you should be worried there are those moments in our lives but if all you know it's just a very smooth life you have to be worried count yourself blessed if you are going through one persecution or the other sure it's an indication that you have found favor with god praise be to god the lord jesus said if any man comes after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me praise be to god and we know as the scripture says that just for the love of god god would make sure that you are persecuted praise be to god it's just a wonderful thing to serve the lord i just don't know i'm just trusting god for tonight i picked one salmon i knew that was it the following day i put it down i took another one i knew that was it put it down took another one oh my and this morning i had to take a new one praise be to god yes let the lord have his voice i have titled this message about it sheep praise be to god remember as i was saying persecutions will come away this is just a little teaching for a wednesday night i was wondering which way to go but i believe god is in it all so for the next few minutes we have let's just see what god has for every one of us a sheep is born a sheep even even when the sheep is lost it still doesn't change its nature it's a lost sheep when the sheep dies he dies a sheep nothing can change it just imagine that you were a hunter and you went to the forest you have the license to go and hand deal and then you saw a ship are you going to shoot that ship probably out of a hundred hunters you may have one that would attempt but a very smart hunter would know that a good shepherd would always leave the 99 aside and seek after the one so a good hunter would say no the shepherd is somewhere around or very close around he would not make a mistake that is even when the sheep has lost his way praise be to god a bad shape remember we are talking about a ship and that is a vessel and a human being is a vessel so eventually we are talking about human beings here now when you look at a ship the very thought and the design was made to serve a purpose the person who manufactured the ship or the company that manufactured the ship did not just manufacture it to put it on the sea just to be another ship on the sea to see how beautiful it will look on the sea that is not the intention if that was the intention it shows how sick the company is but it is created with a design in mind to accomplish a task to serve a purpose so you and i are created to serve a purpose brother branham said that god did not create us just to be another person right no there is a god-given purpose in our lives maybe you are serving that purpose maybe you have not found that purpose yet but there is a purpose for which god has brought you into this life not to be another person you are unique and special the way god has made you never desire to be like another person if they should tell you what you are going through you will never want to be like them everybody is going through one thing or the other in this life you see people out there with smiles on their face looking strong only god knows what they are going through in the inside they come out with smiles on their faces and they are trying to encourage people cheering you up but behind the scenes they are going through a lot be happy who you are the bible says godliness with contentment is a great game to desire to be like somebody else in a way you are telling god that you know better than he is he does be content who you are and always remember that you have a purpose to save praise be to god and whatever the ship needs to achieve its purpose is deeply rooted and is designed and make the company sat down they looked at it they designed it they had a purpose in mind and then they fitted it with an anchor everything the ship knees for its lifetime on the sea is deeply rooted in its design and make right and as a child of god all you need to succeed in this life is deeply rooted in you it is not now god is going to make you over you don't need a makeover everything you need to succeed is right in here praise be to god there is a relationship i don't want to go ahead of myself let me just as i said it's a little teaching and i was all over the place and i'll be doing a little reading here and there praise be to god so the ship maker knows that a ship would encounter problems in his lifetime they know about the waves and the storms on the sea so right from the go the word go they put the anchor in there before the storms ever came before the sheep ever went to sea the anchor was already there they do not have to wait for the sheep to go to sea and in the midst of the storm before they go and then uncle it no the anchor is already there but it is lying down dormant until there is a psalm then they activate it praise be to god now when god made you and i he deposited a bit of him in us that we came into this life burning sin shaped in iniquity doing the building of the devil the devil says jump you jump he says lie down you lie down he says rule there you go just leave it in sin but all that while there was something in you that was lying dormant waiting for his time of manifestation praise be to god now when you get to that point and you get to know who you are there is nothing that can hold you back praise be to god now you just realize brother brother said the two books the devil has the most the book of genesis and revelation because genesis tells us his beginning a revelation tells us his end and not only that praise be to god do you also know that genesis tells you who you are who you really are that you are not a man after this flesh but there is something in you praise be to god that really tells who you truly are and not only that the book of revelation also tells you where you are going to spend your eternity these are things the devil hates for any child of god to know because so long as you don't know who you are he has control over your life but from the day you get to know who you are the devil has lost control over your life praise be to god amen so all you need all you need god has put it in there praise be to god and you realize that the ship is so useless without the sea [Music] for the sheep to receive his glory it has to be on the sea and for the sea to receive is is his shame also it will come from the sea so the very sea that would lift it up if that water gets into it it's the same water see that will sink it do not worry when temptations and trials come they come to lift you up very good they don't come it's like i'm going ahead of myself but that is fine they don't come to thank you well get there again praise be to god amen so when the storms come against the sea it is not how beautiful the ship is that survives the storm it is not the shell size of it that survives the stone it is the uncle which is in place that keeps the ship in place now as i was looking at this the titanic came into mind and the titanic in his base was probably the most beautiful and the biggest ship that was ever built but it sunk right now and what came to me church we should be very careful the things we see there is power so much power in the tongue till the bible says death life and death rest in the power of the tongue right there was a man by the name of edward um what's the name again edward john smith who said that even god himself i am quoting what he said he said even god himself could not sink the ship how can you tempt god that far if you want to be disrespectful be this disrespectful to men it is not a good thing i'm not asking you to but if ever you want to be disrespectful just keep it in the human room it's only a stupid dog that would go and play with a lion praise the lord by the wise dog even when the lion is dead it will not go near it you don't thank god that was the most reckless thing anybody could ever do i believe if it had not been for that statement what happened in 1912 1912 would not have happened the titanic sank they called it the unsinkable ship it sunk over 2 000 people were on that ship over 1 500 died i don't know but probably it is the most the most terrible tragedy that ever happened [Music] be careful the things that come out of your mouth sometimes they are not bad things this was a very reckless thing to say but sometimes they are not even bad things sometimes out of curiosity you find yourself in troubled worries right but again it is not meant to sink you sure we can talk about job here job was curious when a man dies where does he go he kept asking this question and asking this question and he was going to learn where man goes but in fact in a very special way we'll come back to job again because he's part of my message tonight i remember you know there is a condition uh probably for six weeks now i have not experienced it but out of nowhere i have this pain in my heart it just comes and when it comes from zero it goes to two four eight just like that in seconds the first time that happened probably three four years ago i just took a bottle of water open it as soon as i see it the water came and sat right here and then it started sipping down and i could feel it going down and as it was going down the headache was going down and the pain in my heart was going down and it would happen probably every three four months and it got a point it was almost every week so one day i asked myself and every time it happened i had to take in water to stop it because it gives me headache immediately and it's like my head gets numb so i ask myself what if this ever happens and i don't have water on me i asked that question more than once what if it ever happens and i don't have water on me and i was soon going to find out praise be to god we are serving the living god [Music] when the devil thinks he has cornered you that is why you see the glory of god [Music] praise be to god for two years those who have been using 94. you know there was construction day and last year probably around november i'm not sure but they have this they are giant concrete whatever they call it they can just change the road anytime and then we were all using one layer i mean one side of the road now from 694 all the way to rogers there was one lane if you entered that lane you couldn't come out till you get to send michael and there were these other two lanes or the three i'm not sure but the one that was so smooth i always wanted to use it so i was always there and it happened one day as soon as i went off 694 and i entered into that lane that one lane with those giant concrete barriers i didn't even go quite one minute and then i saw there was traffic then i slowed down stopped the traffic was not moving then i was there then from nowhere here comes the pain again just comes from zero two four eight hoof i looked everywhere in the car there was no water now what i do every morning before i go when i'm i get up in the morning i take one bottle of water go on my knees pray and when i'm leaving the house i take another bottle with me on the way i drink that bottle i mean i drink that water till i get to work so that morning i had that empty bottle there was no water in it i had drunk that water but now i had that empty bottle with me in the truck and when that happened now oh i was just there this traffic was not moving so i took the empty bottle i said father help me please i opened it i put the empty bottle and i sucked the air and i put it back praise be to god then the pain just started going down it just started going down and it fizzled out praise be to god we are serving a living god when the enemy comes against you like a flood the spirit of god will lift up a standard against it we have a promise take god by his word i would have just been sitting that bed and you hear on the news oh somebody died of heart attack in in traffic only to realize that oh it was rather down praise be to god it disappeared sometimes it's not something bad you are saying but out of curiosity something comes out of your mouth get ready you are going to see the glory of god praise be to god don't ever forget that we are serving the living god and we are the church of the living god when you speak belief anything you ask of god belief when we were having our prayer series one thing jumped out here of all the things that came this i would never forget that there is no special time for prayer every prayer time is a special time and that has never departed when you pray belief god would never let his children down in moments of your life when you think you are at the west and when you think it is your personal effort you will get to realize that it has nothing to do with you that it is all about god praise the lord that sin that ship that ship sunk because somebody tempted god now as long as there remains a ship there would always be an anchor the anchor keeps you all true life it's meant to carry the ship safely to its destination every single time so long as you remain so long as you walk in the status of the lord so long as you are keeping yourself in the places of the scriptures there is one thing that is sure that that anchor is still holding on right that uncle is still holding on brother branham said and i want to read a few things here when a ship takes enough battering it can break apart but the anchor holes have not started yet sometimes a ship can take a lot of beating a lot of beating remember we are talking about a battered ship sometimes the ship can take a lot of beating till it will break it apart that happened to job sure he is a vessel and we know the story how job took a lot of beating he was broken beyond recognition a ship can take a lot of beating that that beauty surrounding it the beautiful paint the beautiful body the exterior everything would wipe off by that uncle will still be holding up it doesn't matter what you go through in this life it doesn't matter how you are thrown apart and afflicted they can put you in a meal and grind you and you come out on the other side and nobody knows what that is but even in that state the anchor still holes praise be to god the anchor still holds in the message absolute brahmana said even death itself cannot pluck you away from it christ is our uncle what is he he is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the word became flesh that we could handle it christ is our uncle there is nothing we can do without him without him you are fighting a lost battle for he is our shield he is our strength he is our rock he is our righteousness he is our peace our joy our victory can we imagine living a life without christ in the message mechizadek the great prince and king i read which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast entered into that which is in the veil the anchor of our soul thus went into the veil beyond the veil and anchored you know achieved sometimes servicemen and so forth know it and you've been on the sea when really the waves gets to dashing too hard for the boat they anchor it and it goes and it's got a line that lays down to that holds it it may flip it up this way and around that way but the anchor holds it they cannot see land anyway but they drop the ankle beyond the veil which is the which is the water and that anchor goes down into the bottom of the sea top of some big mountains somewhere and drags till it catches on that that mountain that holds into that crevice there and all the sea can't move it no more is anchored out of sight every person that has received christ jesus has personal savior been born again with the holy spirit you've dropped that uncle if you are sick and your hope is built on christ you have dropped your uncle right the doctor may say this that or the other but as sure as your fate looks yonder the waves sex spells fever may rise and everything like that but your ankle holds within the veil sometimes out yonder and this sick in this sick land what have you got your hopes built on the doctor say is gone the medicine says it can't do nothing the surgery has failed but my hope is not built on that we have our hope within the veil what veil through the shedding of his blood that tore his spirit from his body and in between that veil there the uncle has caught a hold of something praise be to god amen i see a ship one time it was tossed about there i thought was holding that ship in that same spot i can't understand sitting out there in the sea and i noticed the waves had carried around this way and back around that way but it didn't move from one place i could not see nothing but there was a little wire rope that ran from top to bottom of that ship onto an anchor that had caught onto something beneath where i could not see beyond that water and it was holding there and i said praise be to god yes one day i found an uncle i write down here i said whosoever will let him come i cast that uncle beyond something i couldn't see something caught ahold and when the battles are raging and the alcohols within the veil when if the devils rise the troubles arise and all around me gives way our anchor holds within the veil where is art i don't know but it's beyond the veil somewhere yonder anchored into the rock of ages our anchor is steadfast unmovable it holds within the will which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast sheer and steadfast praise be to god so remember we are hoping that life is going to be better it's always good to hope but we know according to prophecy that things are not going to be better do not worry how god is going to take care of you his eyes are on you amen he has already made that provision everything you have need of for this journey he has provided don't go to bed worrying yourself how god is going to do it just let loose let him take control over the steering a lot of the wheel we want to over for the uber the uber comes we sit inside and then we have our 50 pound load instead of putting it in the boot and then sitting down and resting or want to sit in the car while we are carrying our load let go and let god be let go and let god be now you would realize that there is always a relationship between the ship and the anchor it takes a stone for the ship to appreciate his uncle but when there are no storms the sheep does not appreciate his uncle but the anchor has always been there that relationship is always there you ought to have a relationship with god amen have a relationship with him in time of peace that in time of war you don't have to live you don't have to look for him praise be to god amen that anchor is always there it has always been there but when the storms of life arise that is when we begin to appreciate god more when you get sick and you see the hand of god it makes you appreciate god more like the story i just shared about myself it just made me to appreciate god more be god god has delivered me from death countless number of times and anytime i'm driving to work and i'm just leaving 94 and i'm coming to 694 i just remember of the goodness of god because that was where i slid i slid and it's about i don't know the distance but probably probably from here to the police station there that was how far it was i slid one two three four any time i got there it just came back sure the relationship has already always been there but something has to happen for you to appreciate what god has done it makes us to appreciate god the more right if we even live saint michael i believe there are days i will just go that way just to drive on that road just to remind myself of what god did for me on that day always make sure do not let a day go by without you having to read your bible do not let a deal go by without you going before his throne of grace to seek his face in prayer and supplication have time to meditate upon the word of god have time have time for god if you look at the pressure there is in this country you have time for everything but god we are living here we know the pressure there is here there is a lot of pressure here there was a guy that traveled to nigeria he was always on um high blood press high blood pres high blood up uh pills he forgot of his pills when he was going and he wondered how he was going to make it he got to nigeria and he didn't need it wherever the pressure went only god knows bp came back to normal [Music] until he came back to america so we all know the pressure there is in this country but if in the midst of it all there are people that are serving god and they are serving him faithfully it's an indication that you can also do it you have no excuse you have no excuse and one thing you also realize that the more sacrifice you put in the things of god the more you get out there is called you are coming to church it snows you come you shovel the driveway coming listening to the word of god you are driving through the snow the wind i mean you are making all things possible to make sure that you have that connection with god and you think god will overlook that now there is something in you sometimes you think it is you know there is something in you that uncle which is driving you there are days you got up and you wish oh i wish i would just stay in the house but before you away you are getting ready for service there is something in you that is dragging you when the ankle holds it doesn't matter what goes on it doesn't matter how much beating you get on the outside it can never take you away from the love of god praise be to god now some stones come not with the intention of sinking the ship it doesn't come to sink the ship but it comes to take the excess load of the ship these people on these vessels will tell you that sometimes the sea gets so rough and what they have to do is that they take the excess load not necessarily excess load but what they do they dump some of these containers dump them till they get to that level where they can manage the rest so some of the storms that come in your life do not come to kill they don't come to sink your sheep but they come to cut you into sheep because there are a lot of things loosely attached to your life are dragging you preventing you from being a child of god that you ought to be and god sends that storm to come and shake you and take that excess baggage of you keep you in line praise be to god and that is what persecution god sends them our way they are trials you think god will send trial away because he wants to sink your ship no when god sends trial your way it's because he wants to lift you up he wants to promote you he doesn't bring you so you would fail no trials are different from temptations and there are other storms that come with the intention of sinking the sheep and that is what temptations do he comes for to kill to kill and to destroy he doesn't come with any good motive he is coming to think it but remember that whenever the devil rises against you the spirit of god would always lift up a standard against him and when the storms rise nobody tells the ship captain what to do he lowers the anchor because that is what the uncle is there for he lowers the uncle the ship captain does not depend on his years of experience he doesn't depend on his intellect on his wisdom no he doesn't try to manage it using his skills all he does he lowers the ankle there is a storm he lowers the ankle and you would realize that when the storm rises it is not the storm versus the ship it is the storm versus the anchor it is the storm versus the ankle and why the hell holes it doesn't matter how high the waves lifts the ship it doesn't matter how far it is tossed about right the ankle is in place praise be to god i remember the lord jesus christ with his disciples in the ship when they were going to the other side of the sea and there was a storm i have not read in my bible that they lowered their uncle they probably did but they tried to burst the ship up the harder they tried the worse it got right and they remembered that the master uncle was behind him praise the lord if they even had an anchor on the ship they didn't have to lower it they didn't need it because the master uncle was there and when they called him even the sea obey him praise be to god praise be to god when the anchor is in place you don't have to worry you look at things with the eyes and they will frighten you but when your ankle is in place you will come out right amen we are not worried so much about what we go through in this life we know by the grace of god we are overcomings be to god it's almost nine o'clock as i said i was all over the place i and it's just interesting how some of the things happen but i believe god is talking to somebody here tonight praise be to god yes so there have been a few cases where a ship would be tossed about but even where the shape is tossed about and it gets drowned the ankle is still in place the ankle is still in place the ankle does not leave the ankle is not attached to just the fancy part of the shape is attached to the frame it doesn't matter how much beating the body takes the ankle is solidly grounded when you have the holy ghost in your soul it doesn't matter what you go through nothing can take you away from that anger sometimes it's just a case of mental fate that it is up here it has not sunk in and we think we have it but it takes situations in our lives to let us know that we don't have what we think we have and it is not a bad thing to know that you don't have what you profess to have that means you need to get to business with god [Music] it's better to think you have it when you don't have it when god makes you to know that you don't have it it's better than for you to deceive yourself that you have it when you don't have it that is a very dangerous place to be and when the anchor is deeply rooted if you have to die you are dying with your uncle the word of god in your soul if you are dying you are dying with the word in your soul it's not going to leave you right god has given us his spirit to carry us for the rest of the journey not to carry us halfway and abandon us no he is carrying us all the way to the end and that is what the uncle is made to do the uncle carries you all the way to the end it doesn't abandon you halfway if christ harris when we were small maybe the age of email the world was a different place you could walk down here throw your wallet here go maybe six hours come back and there'll be somebody around here asking oh i have somebody to have somebody swallow oh it's mine today it is not so right as soon as it falls somebody's behind you to pick it up and put it in your pocket as a matter of fact it's even in your pocket and they want to take it out there is no more love the world is a different place now the world has become so evil so sinful what we are going through now when we were small we are not seeing them the evil that is going on in this day and age and the magnitude i don't want to go into some of these details right i'm wondering when our children get to our age how is the world going to be but i'm not worried because god will take care of his children the best we can give our children the best we can give our loved ones is to introduce them to christ and when it is unclear in their souls if it's emperor in here my goodness when god calls you and you're going you're going in peace because you don't care what happens you know god is going to take care of them you are not worried it's good to leave them with houses machines money which would all go by the way right but there is something that if you introduce the child to and it settles in their souls nothing else can take it away the buried sheep we may go through things if christ terrorists yes it may be sickness it may be afflictions persecution trouble what have you but always remember that there is an anchor in here that is keeping you it's not you keeping the uncle it is the uncle keeping you amen and when the enemy rises against you it is not you the enemy has risen against the enemy has risen against the uncle when paul was persecuting the christians all over at the time he was he saw and he met the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire struck him down listen to what god said so so why are you persecuting me he didn't say why are you persecuting the believers or my children why are you persecuting me anybody who rises against you has risen against god and can a man fight against god and win know that you are in savings you are in savings don't worry what you go through at work don't worry what you go through in the neighborhood don't worry what is going to happen tomorrow just know that the lord our god
