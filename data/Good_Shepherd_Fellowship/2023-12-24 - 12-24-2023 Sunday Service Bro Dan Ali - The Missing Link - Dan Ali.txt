Jesus we thank you so much oh God for our lives and for our health for your goodness towards us and for your grace Upon Our Lives we thank you for all the Miracles that have rought in our lives because our very existence is a miracle we can look at our lives and we can say without meing words that the hand of the Lord has taken a hold of us there is no denying that we'll be very ungrateful to deny that we thank you so much oh God that you have preserved our lives and you have preserved our souls and you have delivered us us from every plan of the enemy and we are so grateful Lord for everything you've done for us and we are here to say thank you dear Lord Jesus we don't take these things for granted Lord sometimes we forget who we truly are and we try to measure our lives with the people of the world the things they have and the things we lack and we forget that there is nothing that is greater than the salvation of our souls we bless you father this morning oh God we glorify thee father and we exalt your holy name for everything you've done father we have gathered once again not to hear the enticing words of men's wisdom for that will not be here your children are here because they believe they will hear the voice of God and Father it's our prayer this morning may you train our ears to hear you speak Lord open our hearts father to receive of you this morning open every eye to behold you father do not let this be just another gathering father may you come down in thine might and Power and meet us at the very point of our needs the Bible says where two or three are gathered in your name you knew before this time that the way of the Gospel is not the popular way and there wouldn't be very many but praise be to God we have made this condition far beyond and we pray the dear Lord Jesus may you come down this morning St afternoon according to your word and minister or to every single need we lift your servant brother one into your hands way down in South Africa Lord you know how dear the Saints are to his heart and father we pray oh God that you will anoint Him Father for the task that lays ahead of him and use him father oh God as a blessing in the congregation of the saints that father you will prosper his Ministry and bless him father in the areas where he has most need we just thank you and we bless you and we glorify thee for having heard and answered our prayers this morning oh God in Jesus name amen shall we be seated for a while praise the Lord God bless your Saints God bless you musicians that will be it for now God bless you brother Lael sister Grace I see your husband and the boys there God bless you all for coming you all warmly welcome to the house of God this morning it's good to see everyone's face and um indeed we are blessed um before I forget on the 31st we'll be having a communion service and uh we are going to have our normal service in the morning and then the evening service starts at 8:00 p.m. praise be to God yes I saw the young men and the young ladies and um both young and old uh um it was a wonderful play this morning even the professionals before they they begin to act they have a lot of time to practice before they they they actually put something together but for those of you who do not know they had only one rehearsal that was last Wednesday and yesterday was the second and the last rehearsal before this performance and that was a wonderful performance can we just give you that praise God God bless you Sister Naomi brother Ariel this is where you you easily get into trouble when you begin to mention names there somebody says oh he left my name out every brother and every sister that was directly or indirectly involved God bless you we we we we we appreciate the the support and uh the performance you know uh let me also thank the parents because we couldn't get to the children without getting through I mean to the parents it's like a mango tree that was just behind I mean by the roadside and every season when the children are passing by and they get there and they see this big big mango they pick stones and they start throwing the stones into the tree and before they get one mango down they may have thrown 20 ter stones and then they plug down the leaves they tear down the back of the tree then one day the tree was complaining why do you guys do this to me I don't like it so the next season comes around and here they come again very ripe mangoes this time they didn't throw stones but they jumped onto the tree and they started shaking it the Tre said oh you guys are disturbing me I don't like that and they say it is not our fault it's because we have seen something good on the tree and parents we may have Disturbed your weekend we may have Disturbed your program in one way or the other but it is because we have seen something good in the children and we couldn't get to the children without getting through you so it's for a good cause praise be to God and we love these children praise God they are a gift of God to this assembly I was somewhere for a period of time and I looked around in the church and there were no children you know how human beings can sometimes think and this stupid thought came to me that the day all of us the old people die in that church where lies the church there is nothing too hard for the Lord the Church of the Living God would always go forward nothing will stop it but this was a thought that came to me and I looked at myself and the rest of the Brethren and everybody was probably about 50 years old and I started doing the math but praise be to God I can look at the youth here and I am not prophesying but I can just do a simple mathematical formula here and I can tell that by the grace of God in the next 100 years we may not be in this building but there will be a people that will lift that blood Banner of Christ very high in this [Applause] assembly it is it's like a relay it's not how good or how fast you can run if it is a relay us boat so far is the fastest man on the planet so if there was a relay let's say 4x4 and then he just ran around the field and then came with his stick and there was nobody to hand it over where lies his effort and children let me talk to you you are not too small to live a Godly life John the Baptist had the Holy Ghost while he was still in his father's womb you can have the Holy Ghost and live a good Christian Life and be a good testimony in your school in your neighborhood am amen that you not only live a Christian Life only when parents your parents are around or when there are eyes watching but you can get to a place and you will live a good Christian lifej and when you are living a good Christian Life it's not only Daddy and Mommy that are happy the church is happy and guess who is the happiest the almighty God is happy that he looks down and he sees himself in you don't say I am a child I am a child there is a story coming I'll just Reserve that for another time you are not children you are children yes in one sense but what you know by the grace of God there are 50 60 year old men out there who do not know it and to whom much is given much I be required don't just say it's Sunday it's Wednesday they are dragging me to church again let it be a joy to live by the word let it be a joy when you hear there is service that you are coming to worship God and you are not coming because they are forcing you to come or they are dragging you that you have to go at all costs let it be a joy to be in the house of God praise the lord we are blessed when we look at our lives and we see what God has done for us where he has taken us from his grace upon us his Divine protection his love his mercies we are blessed and what can we give to God in return like a man that was in his 70 years he took ill and he went to the hospital he was admitted for some days and when he got discharged and they brought him his bill the bill was itemized food let's say $100 um water let's say $20 and then he got to oxygen they put oxygen on him and then they put the bill there and then when he saw it he started crying so the people came and said oh what is going on we can help you if you don't have the money to pay he said I have the money he said I am over 70 years old and I have never paid any bill for the oxygen I breathe every day for over 70 years I come to this hospital for just a week and look at the bill I have been given for oxygen he said I have never paid anything to God and he started crying I mean as a Christian yes you ought to pay your tithes and your offering aside that aside that God does not need anything he has G I mean for the blessings that he has given you how much can you pay God for his mercies how much money for his grace how much money for salvation how much money how much money can you pay God all God needs a return to live a life of appreciation to live a life of appreciation that because of what the grace of God has done for me even though I have the right to live this life I am not going to live that life but I have chosen to walk in the path that the Lord has ordained for me to take God at his word and live by his word the Bible says that obedience is better than sacrifice and to hear King than the fat of rams if you do not take God at his word and if you don't live by the word it doesn't matter what you do whatever sacrifices you bring to God it stinks before his nous God has not delivered us so we can walk right back in into that mess again it's a total Deliverance complete and total Deliverance praise the Lord amen we are blessed that in this and age where people have itchy ears and people all over are preaching Prosperity Gospel that God has given us man that can look at your that can look into your face eyeball to eyeball and tell you what you need to hear not what you want to hear amen a friend went to church I don't know why but some sometimes when they go to church when they come to work they want me to know he came to church he said Dan guess what I went to church last Sunday I said that is very good I went to my wife then he was describing the church I said I didn't even know where he was what church he was talking about and he said but you know what they never read the Bible and I looked at the church it's a very small church so it looks like they are looking for people I said they never read the Bible he said no can you imagine going to church and the Bible is never right then what else is the preacher going to present to the people what else what else so I was telling him you know what I'm going to give you my address the church address he said no I'm going with my father-in-law to his church I said okay that is fine I'm not stopping you but I'll give you an address I I'll go with the wife again I said okay that is fine praise be to God Amen when God delivers you God has an expectation for your life God wants you to distance yourself from anything and everything that is contrary to his word and God wants you to take him by his word not when it seems convenient even in the most inconvenient times God wants you to stand for his word hallelujah God hates hypocracy when you go through the scriptures he was very linear to the Sinners but when it comes to the Hypocrites he was very very hard on them the Pharisees read the scriptures so we are a free people we are free indeed whosoever the son shall set free shall be free indeed we are free and the Bible says there is Liberty in the house of God and we are the house of God we are for God dwells not in temples made of human hands know ye not that ye are the Temple of the Holy Ghost we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and when God has delivered you he has an expectation for your life with that Liberty also comes responsibility God does not deliver you so you live a reckless life God wants to see that token in your life that you live a life that people around you would look at you and know that indeed God has visited you a lot of the times we talk too much and we don't have the life to back it up it is not what you say is the life you live you can say all you need to say or all you want to say if your life does not back it that life is used less until you meet Christ am there were three friends three ladies friends and they would just go and steal in the super a store a a very big store they very very small things that are very expensive hide and bring it out and go and sell one met Christ and he said I am not going to do that anymore for a while the other friends were able to accommodate her and then it got to that point they said you know what we will not go still and then you sit down here and benefit from it you either join us or you have to leave and she had no place to go the pressure was so high that one day she decided to try it she also went took something she brought it out all right but guess what she couldn't sell it her heart condemned her so much that she told her friends no I need to carry this thing back and they said you know what if you carry it back you are you are going to prison she said I don't care I am carrying back anyhow and she went there to the security said I came here and I stole these things but my heart has condemned me so much I'm bringing them back he said you did what said I came here and I stole them when she said today they call the supervisor come and listen to this woman tell your story I came and I saw these things but my heart has condemned me so much I'm bringing them back and then they took it then the owner of the store said you know what we are taking this things back but then we want to work with you we want to give you an employment here to work with us she finally accepted it before she got back to her place her tee were outside the friends were not ready to talk to her anymore she picked the te went away she finally got her place she was working gamefully employed one day she comes to the friends and they said no we don't need you here anymore she said no I need to talk to you guys she said no we have nothing to do with you she went away she came back another time they were not ready to listen but parently they listened to her and you know what even though they threw her out she had a place where she took them in and she told them you meant it for evil but the Lord my God meant it for good you threw me out but you know what I'm bringing you into under my roof she brought them there she never preached Christ to them one day she went to church she was in church and guess what the two friends just came in walked to the Altar and gave their lives to Christ this is what we are talking about it's not so much about what you say is the life you live let your life be an example to the people around you let your life be an example whether in school whether at work wherever let your life be an example in church we all bring our best behavior so you can't tell who is who is when we are gone to our our our places our homes that is when the real you comes up is 1210 we have not started what we are going to do yet praise be to God [Music] um I promise I will not hold us here too [Music] long um but don't take me for my word praise be to God Amen I gave brother Jordan something to print for me and in fact he printed it I didn't I couldn't just line everything up together normally I'll print everything at work I have a computer at home I try printing it yesterday in the night I pled it it will not come on so I wanted to copy it to brother send it to brother Jordan for some reason I couldn't so I copied it to myself brought it this morning gave it to him he printed it for me but everything is mixed up praise the Lord but there were some quotes he was able to get for me and sorry I have my phone up here I normally would leave my phone in the car I don't even like like bringing it to the foer so please understand um shall we stand for the reading of the word praise the Lord shall we turn to Amos 3 Amos 38 Amos [Music] 38 the lion have R who will not fear the lord God have spoken who can but prophesy may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word shall we please be seated the lion has roed who will not fear the lord God has spoken who can bread prophesy now the title of our message this morning is the missing link The Missing Link somebody will say what a message for Christmas uh morning praise the Lord The Missing Link now just to build a foundation in the Garden of Eden was Adam and Eve there were the only two people the two human beings in the garden there were no other human beings apart from Adam and Eve also in the garden were two trees the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil were not like any ordinary tree in the garden they were different they were different they were two spiritual trees the tree of life is a person and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a person these two trees that were in the midst of the garden were not friends they were not there to work in tandem there were two opposing trees one was an enemy to the order and the other was an enemy to the other praise the Lorden in the garden there was a serpent now the Bible says that the serpent was the most cunning animal there ever was in the garden very shrewd smart wiser than any other animal in the garden and the serpent was an upright creature that could work the serpent was an animal but it had certain human characteristics in when sense it was an animal in another sense it was human because the blood of an animal would never mix with the blood of a human being but the blood of this serpent could mix with the blood of man it doesn't matter whether the man is blue white green or red if I am sick and they give me their blood if our blood type is the same my body is going to take it I'm not going to be at risk but my body would not accept an animal blood but the blood of the serpent could intermingle with the blood of man it tells you how close this serpent was to men praise be to God Amen I'm just setting the stage now I'm reading from Joseph meeting his Brethren paragraph 92 and 93 there had always been a conception for if had already lived unrighteous I wish I had a marker here I know time is not our side praise be to God I am just going to skip just a few lines now the serpent the serpent beguiled the woman today men can bring up animal life and the closest animal they have to the human being is the chimpanzee they can make him smoke a pipe ride a bicycle put on a heart tip it that's just like G and wh to a horse is sound he hasn't no soul he can't think thank you brother he has not so he can't think he can only go by sound he doesn't have a soul then they got a missing link right in between here that they never have been able to find praise be to God Amen now just look at this picture that between the man and that chimpanzee there is a missing link right in between science has been able to trace all the way to the chimpanzee but from the chimpan to the men there is a missing link right in there and science has tried many years to find this Missing Link and have not been able to find it the mark of the beast uh 1961 brother Jordan if you can put it okay it's already there praise be to God now okay let me just uh now we find out that the first marking of a human being started in Genesis Genesis 4:15 God marked K of let me drop a little let me drop all right notice so let's go okay um there is something I'm looking for here I don't want to take the whole thing I'm not finding it but I know it's here okay so let me just take this portion here now watch now watch the Bible said I will put emry em God did between your seed and the Serpent's Seed praise the Lord okay now let's leave it right there now science all over the years has tried to establish this Missing Link and has never been able and where signs spiled religion took over science says that there is no God they try to prove the very to to to disprove the very existence of God and they will tell you that human beings evolved from a lower form of life till where we are now now when you look at evolution in any form creatures that evolve from one stage to the other they are still evolving that has not changed it has not stopped why is it that when it comes to human beings that one has to stop so they try to tell you that there is no God and when you outsmart the devil when you try to tell the devil there is a God then he knows that he can't handle you in that basket so now he gives you a religion now note religion does does not deny the existence of God religion tells you there is a God but he gives you what Trinity that there are three Gods if he can get you there he doesn't have to worry his head anymore amen but if you are too smart for that and you believe that God is one here oh Israel the Lord our God is one and you believe in the Oneness of God he tells you Yes actually God is one God is one but do you know um T have changed that you can have a form of godliness that you are a Christian and yet you deny the power thereof that is what religion will do to anybody that you believe that God is one but the days of Miracles are over you believe that God is one but the Holy Ghost is not for you you believe that God is one but God is love and God will never destroy anything and that is okay you can go to the nightclub you can go and do anything you want to do you can go to the drinking par you can drink and smoke and do anything and God is love and it is okay praise the Lord amen so what the devil fails to get you in science what he does is that he tries to capture you in religion religion has never saved any man brother Bram says Cain was very religious he believed in the Oneness of God you couldn't even give Kain three gos you couldn't he believed in the existence of God but Kain was religious now one thing we can all give the devil credit for is that he is full of lies and deceit that is why you don't reason anything out with the Devil the devil is so so so so smart you don't reason with the devil he can just turn your head around your shoulder and bring it back here and tell you you are looking forward and you'll believe it it takes the grace of God he deceived to tears of angels to go to war against God in the garden when God told Adam and Eve you would never eat of that fruit in the midst of the garden that tree the day you eat of it that day you will surely die he comes and he tells them you will not surely die and they believed it if Eve believed it if out of it and finally Adam we all know the story so lies and deceit have always worked for the devil it is the devil's best weapon it has not failed what worked for him yesterday is still working for him today and true lies and deceit he has brought the church to Revelations 3 if we can turn our Bibles to Revelation 3 17 and 18 Revelations 3:17 and 18 let's take from 15 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold or H I would thou were cold or H so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spill thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goose and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou art wretched and M and miserable and poor and blind and naked I Cel thee to buy of me gold tried in fire that thou mayest be rich and white rant that thou mayest be clothed and that the nakedness and and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint th eyes with i s that thou mayest see now religion has brought man to a place why he thinks that he knows it all when he doesn't know it why he thinks that he has it when he doesn't have it and that is a dangerous place for anybody to ever be it is better to deal with a stone hard on believer somebody that is worshiping stones and rivers is better to deal with a person like that than to deal with somebody that has half of the truth because you can't teach them anything because they think they have it already you talk about going to church oh yes I go to church every Sunday I go to church every Wednesday you talk about reading your Bible oh I read my Bible every morning you talk about prayer oh I pray every day what is it that you are going to say that would convince them so when the devil actually gets you down to that spot why you don't have what you think you have the devil doesn't have to fight you anymore he knows that the work is done and that is why the devil has brought this lisian church age that the people are naked and they think they are clothed they are blind but they think they can see they are poor but they said they are rich they are miserable but they say oh we have joy and because of that they refuse the counsel of the Holy Ghost amen which says I counsel thee to buy of me gold red in fire that you may be rich and on and on and on and on remember we are talking about the missing link 12:32 we are talking about the missing link it just struck me that what I was looking for was probably uh um I'm not going to go back to it we are just going to go forward praise the Lord but no matter what you are doing no matter where you think you stand if the grace of God can open your eyes to see is good to submit your will to the will of God am the automaker made a car and they gave it a reverse GE that when you enter a ditch you can just engage the reverse J and get out and the same applies to our lives that in this journey in this journey you are going to engage your reverse year a lot of the times true if you don't have a reversed Year God have mercy we are here to help one another to support one another in prayer it doesn't matter matter whether young or old father or mother children it doesn't really matter you should be able to grow in the love of God in the word of God get to a place that when the brother says I am weak I can't go on anymore you should be able to put your short brother we are going anyhow the Bible says the righteous shall fall seven times and rise up again if you fall you will not make that place your resting place because you will never be comfortable there that is not where you are called to be you are called to be a son and a daughter of God praise the Lord amen that when Daddy or Mommy gets to a place and says son or daughter you know what I can't go on anymore they said no mommy daddy we are going anyhow Hallelujah you used to drag me to church it's my time to drag you now amen praise be to God praise the Lord in this journey you are going to engage your reverse year a lot of the times it's only a fool that will enter a ditch and then just keep raming up the engine like I said one time if I was driving and any of my children was driving behind me and I enter a swamp oh I love my daddy so much he enter a SW at 80 M hour let me go 90 and join him in the ditch who does that who does that even if by mistake you go off your Lan and you enter the swamp you want to reverse and get out if the church can get you if if the devil can get you to be as religious and look so sanctimonious and look so holy and deny the power of God you're coming to church and reading your Bible and praying would not help you in any way he is the same yesterday today and forever he has not changed what he did yesterday under some specific conditions he will do that today again under the same condition the Lord Our God has not changed and never think never think that God has brought you this far to abandon you that is the voice of the devil if you ever tell yourself you ever hear a voice tell you that you are not going to make it that is the devil you think God will send his son to come and die and then he will just turn around and deny you salvation or you think God will tell you that when your neighbor offends you 7 times 49 7 times 70 times forgive and then you offend God and he holds it against you God would not tell you to do something that he would not do don't let the devil hold you back whether with one arm or one leg we are going anyhow we are unstoppable the devil cannot stop us amen by the grace of God we have made it amen the lion have R who will not fear the lord God has spoken who can but prophesy the Bible says we already seated in Heavenly places places through Christ Jesus we have made it when God speaks it is settled amen it doesn't matter what it is for the future it is settled amen it's just like climbing a mountain Everest I know it is the tallest mountain right praise the Lord amen and then you stand at the Pinnacle of that mountain and you hold this phone and then you let go of it you don't stand to see whether the phone is going to fall or not when God speaks he doesn't wait to see whether it is going to be accomplished or not it is settled yes if we can get to that place to take God by his word praise be to God our lives would never be the same again why do you doubt God has he said it and has not done it why are you double-minded you can never receive anything from God if you are double-minded nothing that is according to the word of God a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways and you cannot receive anything from God if you purpose in your heart that you are going to live for God God knows and that is the type of man the type of of woman God is looking for not somebody who build Bridges and then has come to try so if things don't work I'm going back you are not ready yet praise the Lord I don't have my notes but somehow things are going to work out praise the Lord now after the fall there was a great conference in the Garden of Eden that God came down and he called a conference in that conference he told a woman in childbearing she's going to have sorrow and for Adam's sake the ground was cursed but when he came to the to to the serpent he said you are cast above every animal and above every beast of the field and upon thy belly thou shall go and dust thou shall eat all the days of their life and he went on to say that the seed of the woman would bruise thy head now the serpent was not a snake as religion makes us to understand religion has given us E and has given us an apple tree and there is a snake on the side and the snake has taken an apple and given it to Eve I know by the grace of God we are all above that now amen the serpent was an upright creature that was cursed the Cur took off every limp the hands and the feet and broke every bone the was in it and gave it the nature you see today the case made it so and S has been looking for The Missing Link all these years and they have taken the snake and they have examined it is vertebrae the everything in it and they can't see any link between the snake and that missing L they can't see it why because it is hidden from the ey eyes of the wise and The Prudent and revealed to babes such as you and me hallelujah praise be to God Amen it can't take signs signs cannot prove the existence of God how do you prove God if you get to a place to prove God then God is no God anymore he has spoken who can but prophesy in Isaiah 9 six the Bible says unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the g shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace praise be to God am people were wondering how can a virgin conceive it's unscientific it's unscientific how can a virgin somebody that has no know how can a virgin conceive just like in the Book of Genesis when God said the the the seed of the woman will breath the head of the serpent they were wondering the seed of the woman a woman has no seed what is God talking about because when you take any form of reproduction whether plant or animal the seed comes from the male and you are talking about the seed of the woman that was a mystery and then here you are talking of um you are talking of a virgin shall conceive that is a mystery that was why when the angel came to Mary if we can read Luke 1:28 when the angel came to Mary Mary herself was shocked Matthew 1 28 and the angel came unto her and said hail thou um said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou amongst women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and as her mind what manner of salutation is this what manner of salutation this should be praise the Lord amen you can actually even put I mean put yourself in in in in her shoes sometimes people people people say things about you and sometimes you tend to see whether maybe they are referring to somebody else because you look at yourself and you you know you are just an ordinary person and they are just giving you that salutation you don't you don't belong there and she was wondering what type of salutation is this verse 30 and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God like any of us can say today we have found favor with God it is not our good works it is not our good intentions it's not our best behaviors we are not the best of people out there as a matter of fact there are people out there when they should put us against them on the same scale is going to tip in their favor God doesn't care about your morals he comes after you anyhow but after he has redeemed you now he cares how can you prove to God or prove to your neighbor or prove to your brother or your sister that indeed you have met God that indeed you have taken God as his word and you are living by the word and yet still do the same things you used to do or maybe sometimes even worse than they are doing the word of God must take effect in your life they should you see that difference God didn't come for us because we had good morals has nothing to do with it but after God has saved you in spite of whatever life it was God expects you to take his word live by his word and be cleansed and become an example an example to people around you we have found favor in the sight of God there is no question about it but after you have found favor with God what do you do with this word what what do you do with the word of God 31 and behold thou shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of the kingdom and of his kingdom there be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answer and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing who shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God praise be to God Amen the seed of the woman that crushes the head of the serpent is Christ Jesus he was virgin born the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary and Mary took seed it was on scientific there is no way science could ever establish that the missing link The Missing Link now from the message led by the spirit led by the spirit now we realize now we realize and everyone knows there is a there is Spirits then if there is Spirits there is bound to be a master of that spirit because it changes the nature of Sinners into Christians and there is bound to be a master or head there somewhere and and and that's God and he sent his son on earth made in likeness of sinful flesh and he died that we might be redeemed and brought back to God to be Sons and Daughters of God to walk with him again that Missing Link from the Garden of Eden what Adam lost Christ restored it praise the Lord what Adam lost Christ restored it now um I'm reading again from the angel of God 1947 paragraph 21 he was the first one I don't think I'm reading everything here excuse me uh let me get my phone all right I think I have what I'm looking for here praise the Lord what's the matter with the church today that is what I want to know if Christ was the missing link between God and man and he come to hook God and man together again what is the matter today is because of unbelief because of unbelief and that was all he came to do to restore Adam and Eve sorry to restore what Adam lost in the garden praise be to God now the good news if you don't take anything from today's service I don't want you to forget this praise the lord we have established that the devil is very deceitful and that has worked for him very very well so much so that Matthew 24:24 so much so that Matthew 24:24 says for there shall arise false prophets false Christ and false prophets and shall sheld great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect if it were possible this bride of Christ will never be deceived this bride of Christ can never be deceived it is just not possible now when you look at what happened in the garden it was Eve and the serpent Adam was not on the scene all that was going on was between Eve and the serpent that was why if God deceived but today the second Adam and the second if Christ and the church we are not leaving apart Christ is in his church not only is he in his church but he's also in his bride so guess what whenever the enemy shows up guess who shows up is Christ and not you amen that is why you can never be deceived the Church of the Living God can never be deceived am left to you alone nobody is a match for the enemy and sometimes sometimes the devil will just come and preach his sermon to you sometimes you don't even catch yourself before you realize what is going on he would have even gotten you sometimes he will sweep you off your feet completely but still he doesn't get his way why because there is something in you that is holding you it is not you nobody is a much for the devil but there is something in you that keeps holding you Hallelujah a lot of us can look at our lives and then we don't even know how we have come this far how we made it this far we can't tell when we get to heaven and we begin to tell our stories and they ask you brother how did you make it sister how did you make it you will have no worth you will say it's just by his grace is by his grace it is not by might nor by power it's by his Spirit the Bible says your hand has laid the foundation and your hand will complete that complete the house it's God who has laid the foundation it's God who has called us it's God who has started the work is God who is seeing it through and God will bring his work to a completion nothing can stop it like the thief on the cross when we GA on that day and we ask the thief how did you make it so I don't know I don't know I was on the cross waiting to die and things just changed what is the story Grace Grace sometimes we think sometimes we think that it's from when we believed that God turned his attention on us no it's never been praise the Lord in my life over a period of 30 30 something years I've had I've had I've had 12 either 11 or 12 dreams and I'm talking of spiritual dreams now you would think that it is your effort you would think that it is your ability you would think that it is it is you that just got up and decided you want to be here this morning no the grace of God brought you here left on your own there are more than 10 20 30 places you would want to go this morning but you chose to be here God is keeping an eye on every one of his children it is not from the day you believed God started performing miracles for me when I was a baby I think I told that story before when my stepmom I was sick I was taken to the hospital they gave me medication it was in a bottle a baby of according to my mom I was I was less than 6 months old and then she emptied the medicine in the sink and then filled it with something else whatever it was nobody knew it so a mother's instinct she comes and she takes the bottle it's time for mommy to give baby the medicine and she sees that no it's stained it wasn't like this and then she empty some in a in in a in a in a cup and it was a different color you think it was my mother it was not my mother it was God keeping an eye on this guy here I told you guys of a story where I got drowned completely drowned I was supposed to be in school I went with a friend it was a dam who went and was swimming I just jumped into the water and my two legs just something just draged me into the under on under the dam and I was in the water trying to shout you know you can't shout in water so I was when I open my mouth I was drinking water the guy was far away on the other end of the dam how else he got to know that was drowning only God and a child his age who were age m I think I was just about gospel's age so if I went to a place and I was drowning or somebody his age I went there and he was drowning what sense do I have to get into the water to bring him out I'll be running help help help but the boy comes in he Dives in and he pulls me out you think it was him it was God and as I said once upon a time I was a Muslim I was a Muslim one night I got up used the restroom came back I lay on the bed I was not asleep I was not I was just lying down on my back and then just between sleep and wake and the do door just open and light about fire about this tiny fire just entered through the door and then it came right where I was it stopped about this distance and I was looking at it what is this and I felt wait something pushed me to the bed if that had not happened I don't know what I was going to do but something pushed me to the bed and I was still looking at the fire the the the coil of fire and then it just opened it was so powerful I tried to close my eyes but there was an inscription in it and the inscription is the light praise be to God and I shouted Jesus and my brain just w r Hallelujah then the fire just went back it condensed again I was lying down and they I shouted again Jesus three times and the weight just went off me the fire just condensed back to its original state it went straight to the door the door opened and then the door shut it went the light went out the door got shut it was Friday night getting into Sunday morning the following Friday night getting to Saturday the following Sunday that right Sunday I went to church I remember it was um an Apostolic Church the Lord I was a Muslim I was not a Christian but in all those years I was going to the voodoo doing that my Muslim is ISL ritual doing all those things running about the eyes of God God were upon me than sometimes we think is when you are is from when you begin to believe God's eyes has always been upon you if God would just open our eyes to see what is happening in the spiritual realm concerning us you may not even eat that is why I Dan I don't fear death when I walk out of fear and death meets me here I'm going by the grace of God who is here to live forever it's not how long you live that matters it's what you do with the word of God Heaven and Earth shall pass away the only thing that will not pass away is the word of God Amen and whatever you do with the word of God matters is the most in your life don't turn God down Harden not your heart this day when God is knocking at the door of your heart 107 praise the Lord had not your heart this day we are

Ghost you must be born again by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body getting the Holy Ghost is a must and God is willing to to give you the Holy Ghost more than you are ready to accept him

are rededicating and you are Rec consecrating your life onto God coming every day there is service praying seeking the face of God reading the messages listening to the Tes reading the Bible you are on your way it's just one step at a time and I am not talking about gaining One Step today and losing it tomorrow that's not what I'm talking about like a Buffalo Soldier that one step forward two step backward tomorrow three steps forward two step backward that's not what we are talking about if you take a step maintain it amen stand your ground stand your ground it doesn't matter what storms come your way stand your ground remember he is the master of the storms he speaks and the storms obey him am the storms can distinguish his voice from the billions of voices the storm can distinguish his voice when he speaks the storm knows my master has spoken so when you have taken a step and the storms come know who is behind the [Music] stones know who who is behind the stones don't look at the stones look at the one behind the storms and God will not send any storm your way just for the F of it if there is any storm your way it is for a good cause if God allows any storm your way it is

in God die believ in him I don't want to live to be 100 years praise God if I'm here for 100 years what is the value of life without Christ what is the value of life without Christ in the scheme of events when you take Christ out of the equation what do you have left if you decide today that I have decided not to be a Christian anymore I want to go into the world what do you gain let me tell you you young ones somebody may tell you that oh you are missing something in the world you are not missing anything you are not missing anything if there is anything you are missing you know what it is you are missing sin you are missing sickness you are missing shame M that is what you are missing sickness and diseases that is what you are missing you are not missing anything the world has nothing

yourself blessed to be a Christian count yourself blessed to hear the voice of God talking to you count yourself [Music] blessed you are not here by chance is by Divine orchestration is the plan of God that you should be here today is the plan of God that you should be alive today is the plan of God that the word of God should be entrusted in your care brother said if he had the blood of the Lord Jesus in a charger how careful how careful he's going to walk to make sure he doesn't spal it and you and [Music] me is what the blood has done we are purchased by the blood we are purchased by the blood of the Lord Jesus praise the Lord what is who is this Jesus to you whom we are celebrating today we know he was not born on the 25th so we are not celebrating the day but he was born we are celebrating his birth who is this Jesus to you who is this Jesus [Music] so we are not talking about the birth of Christ in a Manger but the birth of Christ in the manger of your heart yes even in your soul he is the missing link between God and man he has come to hook us back to God praise be to God Christ The Missing Link is our Lifeline he that has the son has life and if you do not have the son the answer is simple you don't have life it doesn't mean that you can't have the son if you don't have him today there is hope for the living there is hope for the living there is hope for you praise be to God without him you are lost that is a hard fact without him we are lost Christ is the missing link between God and man between the Heaven and the Earth the bridge between life and death the bridge between mortality and immortality if you miss him you have missed everything it doesn't matter your achievement life without him is incomplete like the Cornerstone that the builders reject praise be to God he is the same yesterday today and forever what he did yesterday he will do it again today and as we are celebrating the birth of Christ this morning I want you to know that out of love he came he didn't come to judge the world but that the word well through him might be saved he didn't come to judge the world but if you do not accept the pardon the very word has come to set you free today tomorrow that word will stand against you we are talking about the birth of Christ in the manger of your heart the birth of Christ in the manger of your heart let Christ be born in you let him live in you let him transform your life let him be the friend that he wants to be to [Music] you that you can always have a friend to talk to you can always have a friend to confide in he never gets tired any day any time any moment he is ready to listen to you praise be to God why would you want to saell your salvation for the things of this world that would one day just slip off your hands if a man should gain the whole world and lose his very own soul what have you gained what have you gained gained what have you gained if you are the president of the whole world and you had all the I mean every every every wealth all the wealth of the world if you had it the day you die it's 6 ft by 6 ft and the people will cry just for a little while and then they close that chapter you are gone your life is done where are you going to spend eternity where are you going to spend eternity it is time for us to sit and ponder over our lives sech our hearts and ask yourself honest questions all the years I have believed and all the years have been walking with Christ how far have I come how far how far have I come all the years I see I have believed how far have I come it's 1:30 praise be to God I just want us to go to the Lord in prayer talk to God for God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and God wants us to love him back he first loved us God wants you to show that to reciprocate that [Music] love and it's not by word of mouth it's not by Word of Mouth what you do with the word of God shows how much love you have for God how do you treat the word how do you treat the word do you treat the word with contempt what you do with the word shows how much love you have for God God has no grandchildren whether small or old I want us to go before the Lord talk to God talk to God one of these days it to be over I don't know this could be the last Christmas we ever celebrate it could be
