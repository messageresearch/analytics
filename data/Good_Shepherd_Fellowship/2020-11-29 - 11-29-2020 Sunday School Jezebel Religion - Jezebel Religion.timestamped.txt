[16:16] they'll show himself on this platform
[16:18] here hard strong
[16:21] preaching these are men who have
[16:23] Revelation who know that there not
[16:26] anything against a man
[16:29] sometimes we get hooked into systems
[16:30] that makes us them systems is what we're
[16:32] against not the man God's
[16:37] servant now if we had discernment
[16:40] forever walk here how long you think I'd
[16:42] be here I collapsed when I got about
[16:45] after about six five or six 10 a little
[16:48] more maybe half quarter of the line I'd
[16:50] be gone the rest of them would be pray
[16:54] ball we can't do that if but you you
[16:58] don't have to have that you know what's
[17:00] your trouble you know what you've done

[17:13] going to do you one bit of good to come
[17:14] through here you're just wasting your
[17:16] time that is true is that right brother
[17:21] that's look here here stands brother kid
[17:23] here I like tore the cars off my car to
[17:25] get to him about a year or two ago that
[17:27] he was dying with cancer
[17:30] go to die that day his wife told me said
[17:32] hurry he said he's dying now when he got
[17:35] there the Lord healed him here he's
[17:36] still standing I think he's gained so
[17:38] much weight and everything an old
[17:40] veteran back under that the kind of man
[17:42] I was talking about years ago that
[17:44] preached and laid right on to that word
[17:45] and the people laughed at him and him
[17:47] and his wife walking railroad tracks and
[17:49] everything else and we up in the
[17:50] mountains and coal mines and run out and
[17:52] throw it in jail everything else that's
[17:53] the man who fought to win the prize
[17:56] that's the kind Hallelujah
[17:59] now Brethren I say to you you probably
[18:03] would not have the spirit of discernment
[18:05] that don't have to be see that ain't
[18:07] necessary the first thing you're a man
[18:10] of the word you're far better more
[18:11] preachers than I am because I'm I'm not
[18:13] much of a Preacher but I but you you're
[18:16] anointed any man that's called to preach
[18:19] the gospel is called to heal the sick
[18:22] the general orders is going to all the
[18:25] world and preach the gospel to Every
[18:26] Creature he that believeth in his
[18:28] baptized shall be saved these signs
[18:30] shall follow them and believe if they
[18:32] lay their hands on the sick so forth
[18:34] they shall recover amen if you're called
[18:36] to be a minister you're called to pray
[18:38] for the sick and the reason I do this is
[18:40] so this audience that they might see
[18:42] that they don't have to wait to some
[18:44] special person or Roberts Tommy Hicks
[18:46] Tommy OS myself somebody comes by for
[18:48] healing service I want them to see that
[18:50] you are man of God see you're a man just
[18:53] as much right to lay hands on any of
[18:55] them as as I or anybody else after all
[18:58] other than you all know us as ministers
[19:00] it's their own faith in God that does
[19:02] the work is that rightl we just offer a
[19:05] prayer
[19:06] part now you say brother Brandon is the
[19:08] spirit of the Holy Spirit there with you
[19:11] certainly yes sir now to you in the a in
[19:14] the line there if you believe with all
[19:16] your heart that God's going to heal you
[19:17] raise up your hand I'll
[19:20] accept now come here let this let this
[19:23] lady come here
[19:26] this I don't know you have never ever
[19:28] seen if the holy spirit will tell me so
[19:31] my brethren here in the presence here
[19:33] like this so they're all standing here
[19:35] around me and not only that my brethren
[19:38] are here and my lord is here it's their
[19:40] lord too now if he will tell me
[19:44] something wrong with you whatever is
[19:46] wrong with you you know where it's the
[19:47] truth or not I want them I want the
[19:49] audience I want the people out there to
[19:51] see that the Holy Spirit you're at the
[19:53] platform to give discernment but that
[19:55] don't heal anyone but if he will tell
[19:58] tell me something about you that you
[20:00] know I know nothing about just like it
[20:03] was the woman at the well not the same
[20:05] kind of case but I mean a man and woman
[20:07] meeting for the first time Jesus kind of
[20:09] a middle-aged
[20:10] man and this woman probably is a young
[20:13] woman maybe like
[20:15] you and if he would could tell me what
[20:20] you're here for your trouble would you
[20:23] believe that it have to be his spirit
[20:25] that would do it you brother believe
[20:26] that that the same Lord Jesus stand here
[20:29] you audience believe the same thing
[20:31] would you in the prayer line believe the
[20:32] same thing and know that these men would
[20:34] I call them up here if I thought they
[20:36] wasn't after preaching like this and
[20:38] saying the things I have and I call man
[20:40] up here that wasn't worthy I wouldn't do
[20:42] that I'd be defeating the very thing I
[20:44] was fighting about see I believe them I
[20:47] believe they're a man of God now see if
[20:49] the Holy Spirit stands
[20:53] close just to speak with you I'm trying
[20:55] you say what are you doing brother brand
[20:56] the same thing Jesus done the woman said
[20:58] bring me a drink you just try and talk
[21:00] to her man to find out what her trouble

[21:06] what you're suffering with if that's
[21:08] right raise up your
[21:10] hand now she sure doesn't look it does

[21:15] trouble is she's been that way a long
[21:17] [Music]
[21:19] time always crossing your Bridges before

[21:24] it's your
[21:25] makeup just made that way

[21:32] happen doesn't sometimes the devil tells
[21:35] you there's nothing to it you backslid
[21:37] you're cross the line I'm not reading
[21:39] your mind but I'm reading what I'm
[21:41] knowing what he's talked to you about
[21:42] because to see what's crossed your mind
[21:45] now Jesus perceived their thoughts is
[21:47] that
