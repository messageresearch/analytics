[11:33] thank you josh
[11:35] amen
[11:36] i was thinking of your little testimony
[11:38] that you shared
[11:39] what was it last sunday
[11:41] anyway it was recently anyway and it
[11:44] kind of made me smile a little bit
[11:45] because he's talking about his dad and
[11:48] how that his
[11:49] dad and mom persevered
[11:52] through all of his trials
[11:54] and made me think of loyal you know
[11:56] made me smile you know i remember loyal
[11:58] was about 15 years old and
[12:01] i remember i looked him in the eye one
[12:03] day and i said loyal i said i know
[12:04] exactly what you're thinking
[12:06] i said you feel sorry for your mom and
[12:09] dad
[12:10] i says would you like to share some of
[12:12] that great knowledge and wisdom that you
[12:15] have at the ripe old age of 15.
[12:19] the only thing he just he didn't say one
[12:21] word he just gave this little mona lisa
[12:23] smile
[12:24] of course
[12:25] years later he told me that's exactly
[12:27] what he was thinking
[12:30] and so of course the lord had you know
[12:33] maybe by the time he was in his early
[12:35] 20s the lord had gotten a hold of his
[12:37] life and he was serving the lord now and
[12:40] and
[12:41] he said he was amazed by how much
[12:44] smarter
[12:46] neil naomi and i had gotten in those six
[12:49] or seven years
[12:51] since he had been thinking about that so
[12:57] so i just appreciate that josh amen your
[13:00] testimony

[48:50] for the boat ride yesterday
[48:54] um
[48:55] god bless you musicians yes that will be
[48:56] all for now
[49:00] i probably have to be sitting on the
[49:02] front row from now i was enjoying the
[49:04] basic tie it was so wonderful
[49:07] i could feel it deep down my heart
[49:10] and it was a very wonderful boat ride
[49:12] for those of you
[49:14] who missed it and yesterday i got to see
[49:17] all the young people we have in the
[49:19] church
[49:21] yes
[49:22] and it brings a lot it brought a lot of
[49:24] memories too
[49:26] you know something you love you can
[49:28] never get away from it
[49:29] i love water
[49:31] even though i was drowned once upon a
[49:33] time
[49:34] it has never taken that love away
[49:36] yes
[49:38] i know it's just the first
[49:40] it will not be the last of his kind
[49:45] if we can turn our bibles to
[49:48] exodus
[49:50] exodus 12
[49:54] exodus
[49:55] 12.
[49:58] yeah when i heard
[50:00] of the prayer request it looked like
[50:02] almost half the church
[50:05] is down
[50:06] but don't worry if there is an empty
[50:08] seat next next to
[50:10] you because wherever the angel i mean
[50:14] this message
[50:16] goes the angel of the covenant is there
[50:19] and i believe that there are angels
[50:21] everywhere there is an empty seat
[50:25] um let's keep praying for them
[50:28] yes exodus 12
[50:31] 12
[50:32] to 13.
[50:38] for i will pass through the land of
[50:40] egypt this night
[50:43] and will smite
[50:45] all the first born in the land of egypt
[50:49] both men and beasts
[50:51] and against all the gods of egypt i will
[50:54] execute judgment
[50:56] i am the lord
[50:58] and the blood
[51:00] shall be to you
[51:02] for a talking
[51:03] upon the houses
[51:05] where ye are
[51:07] and when i see the blood
[51:09] i will pass over you
[51:11] and the plague shall not be upon you to
[51:14] destroy you
[51:16] when i smite
[51:18] the land of egypt
[51:20] praise be to god shall we turn over
[51:23] again
[51:24] to joshua 2 12
[51:27] joshua
[51:29] 2
[51:31] 12.
[51:37] joshua 2 12 also 12 and 13
[51:41] and i read
[51:43] now therefore i pray you swear unto me
[51:48] by the lord
[51:49] since i have showed you kindness
[51:52] that you will also show kindness onto my
[51:55] father's house
[51:57] and give me a true token
[52:00] and that you will save a life my father
[52:04] and my mother and my brethren and my
[52:06] sisters
[52:07] and all that they have
[52:10] and deliver our lives from death
[52:13] praise be to god
[52:15] may the lord add his blessings to the
[52:18] reading of his word
[52:20] shall we be seated
[52:25] once again i welcome all of you to the
[52:27] house of the lord
[52:29] if there was any time
[52:32] that we ought to do an introspection
[52:36] to search within our hearts
[52:38] and to make sure that we are living in
[52:41] the pages of the scriptures
[52:43] it is now
[52:45] this is the most dangerous time there
[52:48] has ever been
[52:49] that the bible says that if it was
[52:52] possible the very elect will be deceived
[52:54] because the two spirits
[52:56] are going to get so so close that it is
[53:00] difficult it will be difficult to
[53:02] separate them
[53:04] that it is very very very easy
[53:10] for you to be standing
[53:12] on a very thin ice of
[53:16] in a very cold winter month
[53:19] and then you will think that you are
[53:20] standing on a rock
[53:22] wait spring is coming
[53:25] and we will see
[53:27] whether that sheet of ice is still there
[53:29] or not
[53:31] we are living in the most dangerous time
[53:34] there has ever been
[53:36] and you ought
[53:38] to examine your life every single moment
[53:41] along the way
[53:44] do not care what somebody else is doing
[53:47] do not look across your shoulders
[53:50] if the devil tends your head to the left
[53:52] you see somebody that is not living
[53:54] right
[53:55] look to the left to look to the right
[53:57] you will find somebody that is leaving
[53:59] right
[54:00] the devil would always try to discourage
[54:02] you
[54:04] by appointing you to people
[54:06] that will profess the message
[54:09] and yet are not living right
[54:12] also point them point the devil
[54:15] to people that are professing the
[54:17] message and are living right
[54:22] it is such a dangerous moment
[54:26] our going home time
[54:29] is
[54:30] right here
[54:33] any day it will all be over
[54:38] praise be to god
[54:41] i remember there was a dream i had
[54:44] probably
[54:46] two and a half years ago
[54:51] and in the dream
[54:55] when i looked at the skies
[54:58] the sky suddenly just changed
[55:04] and you could tell that there was danger
[55:06] coming
[55:08] and as i stood i was shouting
[55:11] and calling people's attention
[55:13] that there was danger coming
[55:16] two things happened
[55:19] either they did not care
[55:21] or those who cared actually looked in
[55:23] that direction
[55:24] but they were not seeing what i was
[55:25] seeing
[55:28] but in that moment animals came
[55:31] racing
[55:33] they were just running down the hill
[55:35] they were just racing and running for
[55:37] their dear lives and yet
[55:40] the human beings were not seeing it
[55:43] they were just they were just walking so
[55:45] like a dazy cow
[55:48] i don't know whether that way they sell
[55:49] in the dictionary
[55:51] they just took their time
[55:55] and i was shouting
[55:57] and i was shouting
[55:58] and they wouldn't hear me
[56:02] just about four or five months ago
[56:05] a lot of the times my mind would just go
[56:07] round
[56:08] the dreams i've had over the years 30 40
[56:10] years
[56:12] and then my mind just came back
[56:14] to this very dream
[56:16] and then
[56:18] noah
[56:19] and the scenario noah went through just
[56:22] played out that in the death of noah as
[56:25] the bible says as it was in the death of
[56:28] noah so shall it be at the coming of the
[56:31] son of man
[56:32] that in the death of noah he preached
[56:35] the word 120 years and nobody even
[56:38] heeded it
[56:39] it was just noah his wife his sons and
[56:41] his son's wife and then
[56:45] the animals
[56:46] just came in peace
[56:49] it's half it's just funny to hear how
[56:51] some people just you know a lot of the
[56:53] times talk about noah going to the bush
[56:56] to arrest the animals in peace
[57:00] this was not before the fall
[57:02] where adam could talk to the animals and
[57:04] they were listening
[57:05] after the fall and i imagined noah going
[57:08] to stand before the lion and say come
[57:10] with me
[57:14] by divine intelligence
[57:17] by a divine hand
[57:20] god just escorted the animals in peace
[57:24] male and female the buffalo male and
[57:27] female the elephant male and female not
[57:31] male and male
[57:33] not female and female
[57:35] male and female
[57:38] we don't believe in that tommy road that
[57:40] foolishness out there and you guys in
[57:42] school i know they teach you a lot of
[57:44] stupid things in school
[57:46] know that you are children of god and
[57:48] you don't stand for those things
[57:51] marriage is between a man and a woman
[57:55] don't let anybody tell you that marriage
[57:57] can be between a man and a man or two is
[58:00] just so much filth going on
[58:03] in the olden days did i say in the olden
[58:06] days
[58:07] lord have mercy
[58:09] in those days we read and then we heard
[58:12] how god destroyed sodom and gomorrah
[58:16] for doing these things
[58:17] and then we come to america
[58:21] america
[58:23] and then we are seeing those things we
[58:25] read from the bible
[58:27] the stories we heard
[58:29] we are seeing the reality of it here in
[58:32] america
[58:34] and it's one thing when you hear about
[58:36] it is another thing when you are seeing
[58:40] it it's very horrible i tell you
[58:44] there was
[58:45] a seminar a summit they call it
[58:48] that i attended
[58:51] it was organized by the company
[58:53] i'm working for
[58:54] probably two and a half years ago
[58:57] all over the country were over 600
[58:59] people
[59:00] and when we got it the person that came
[59:04] to open the whole summit guess what he
[59:06] was a gay
[59:08] and then i was wondering what is going
[59:10] on here
[59:11] what am i doing here
[59:13] as if that was not enough
[59:15] there was a breakout session we brought
[59:18] out probably in hundreds
[59:20] and then we sat in a round table
[59:24] i was on the same table with about three
[59:26] four other people
[59:28] and guess what there was a mass sitting
[59:30] opposite me and when he got the mic
[59:34] he said my husband i said what is this
[59:38] i am looking at a man
[59:40] talking to everybody that saying my
[59:42] husband i said no i'm at the wrong place
[59:47] that they are not even ashamed
[59:50] of the life they are living
[59:53] is such a mess
[59:56] so so so disgraceful
[1:00:00] that we are living in the days of sodom
[1:00:02] and gomorrah
[1:00:06] and there is judgment coming
[1:00:09] how would you escape that judgment
[1:00:13] how are you going to escape that
[1:00:15] judgment
[1:00:17] we'll get there in a few minutes
[1:00:21] that god destroyed the whole earth with
[1:00:24] flood
[1:00:26] and god gave a sign
[1:00:29] in the clouds
[1:00:30] he set his bow in the clouds
[1:00:33] to keep him in remembrance
[1:00:36] that so long as this world remains he
[1:00:39] will no longer destroy it with water
[1:00:43] praise be to god
[1:00:45] god gave them
[1:00:47] thank you
[1:00:48] a sign a token
[1:00:53] what a good place to introduce my
[1:00:54] subject for today
[1:00:58] the prophet
[1:01:00] preached i think three or four messages
[1:01:03] and he titled it the token
[1:01:08] and we are going to talk about
[1:01:10] the talking amen
[1:01:13] praise be to god
[1:01:15] we are going to talk about the token
[1:01:19] yes
[1:01:20] yes
[1:01:23] now when you take these scriptures we
[1:01:25] read
[1:01:27] i want to start from the last one then
[1:01:29] we go back
[1:01:32] after the death of moses
[1:01:37] god gave the mantle of leadership
[1:01:42] to his servant joshua
[1:01:48] and he told joshua that as i was with
[1:01:50] moses so shall i be with you
[1:01:54] and
[1:01:55] we all know
[1:01:57] that joshua was not a man that would
[1:01:59] pull back his punches no
[1:02:03] if there was anyone that knew god and
[1:02:07] knew god very well it was joshua
[1:02:11] he took god for his word
[1:02:15] so much so that when they got to kareem
[1:02:17] kadesh barnia and moses sent them to go
[1:02:20] inspire the land when they brought an
[1:02:22] evil report
[1:02:25] joshua and caleb withstood the rest
[1:02:30] basing their promise
[1:02:32] or nothing but the word of god
[1:02:34] that god has given us the land and we
[1:02:37] are more than able to take it we are not
[1:02:39] looking at the size of the men
[1:02:41] we are looking at what the word of god
[1:02:43] says
[1:02:44] praise be to god amen
[1:02:47] if there was anybody that
[1:02:49] understood god
[1:02:51] and took god for his word it was nobody
[1:02:53] by joshua
[1:02:55] but look at it
[1:02:57] and joshua knew
[1:02:59] that he could take the land without
[1:03:02] having to send spies to go and spy the
[1:03:05] land
[1:03:07] he didn't need any spy
[1:03:10] and in any case
[1:03:11] if the spies had even come back
[1:03:14] with any negative report was that going
[1:03:17] to stop joshua
[1:03:18] no way
[1:03:19] not the judge we have read off
[1:03:22] but why would joshua send spice
[1:03:25] in fact
[1:03:26] as long as this word remains there are
[1:03:28] certain things that would never change
[1:03:31] you will think countries spy on one
[1:03:33] another it probably started maybe in the
[1:03:36] last decade or two no
[1:03:38] it's something that has been happening
[1:03:40] over the years
[1:03:42] countries spying on one another
[1:03:47] today we are in an age of technology
[1:03:50] why the countries
[1:03:52] use drones
[1:03:54] for intelligence gathering they use
[1:03:56] satellites to spy on one another even
[1:03:58] beyond that
[1:04:00] they have not stopped the old way
[1:04:03] why human beings have to go in
[1:04:05] to spy
[1:04:07] see america is spying on russia russia
[1:04:09] is spying on on china and what have you
[1:04:12] everybody is just fine
[1:04:17] praise be to god
[1:04:20] and joshua sends this spice
[1:04:25] when joshua sent the spice
[1:04:28] he did not know
[1:04:30] that there was a woman in jericho by the
[1:04:33] name of rhea
[1:04:36] the spies that were going did not know
[1:04:40] that there was a woman
[1:04:42] in
[1:04:43] in jericho by the name of rehab
[1:04:46] but there was a god
[1:04:49] there was a god who knew of rahab
[1:04:54] there was a god
[1:04:57] who knew that there was rehab there
[1:05:00] and in god's great eternal plan
[1:05:06] rahab
[1:05:07] was there
[1:05:09] and god knew
[1:05:11] that jericho was going to go down
[1:05:14] but rahab was not going to go down with
[1:05:16] jericho
[1:05:18] praise be to god
[1:05:20] and thus make sure that his servant
[1:05:23] sends his despise now the spies go
[1:05:28] they go into jericho
[1:05:30] and then
[1:05:31] word guess to the king of jericho
[1:05:34] that the children of israel are here to
[1:05:36] spy the land
[1:05:39] oh
[1:05:41] and i've been wondering
[1:05:44] how come when they saw the children of
[1:05:46] israel despised they knew that this was
[1:05:49] price they knew that this was israelites
[1:05:53] how
[1:05:54] because there were other nations around
[1:05:56] them
[1:06:01] a christian
[1:06:03] especially in the day and age we are
[1:06:05] living in
[1:06:07] if you have to get to a place to
[1:06:10] introduce yourself i am a christian i am
[1:06:13] a christian i am a christian then there
[1:06:15] is something wrong with your life
[1:06:18] you a christian a child of god when you
[1:06:21] walk to a place they should be able to
[1:06:23] tell who you are
[1:06:26] you don't need to carry a placard
[1:06:28] showing who you are
[1:06:31] by your life the bible says we are
[1:06:33] written epistles
[1:06:35] that the word of god has become flesh in
[1:06:38] you
[1:06:38] you feed on the word the word has become
[1:06:41] flesh in you and when you walk out there
[1:06:44] and the people see you they know who you
[1:06:46] are
[1:06:48] you don't have to tell anybody who you
[1:06:50] are
[1:06:51] we are living in a world of darkness
[1:06:54] and when light enters darkness
[1:06:58] darkness knows that light has come
[1:07:01] the light does not have to tell the
[1:07:03] darkness i am here darkness knows it is
[1:07:06] here
[1:07:07] praise be to god
[1:07:08] when you walk anywhere anywhere you go
[1:07:12] your influence alone tells the people
[1:07:14] that something about this place has
[1:07:16] changed
[1:07:18] they may never know who you are
[1:07:21] they may never know where you are coming
[1:07:22] from
[1:07:23] but there is something just something
[1:07:26] about you
[1:07:27] praise be to god
[1:07:29] and when they got there
[1:07:31] the children said you
[1:07:33] the children of israel are here
[1:07:36] they have come to spy on the land
[1:07:40] and then white gets to the king
[1:07:42] and the king says his people
[1:07:45] go and bring them
[1:07:47] we have to get these people arrested
[1:07:50] and then they go to rehab
[1:07:54] rehab
[1:07:56] those two gentlemen that came to you
[1:07:59] they are spies
[1:08:04] thank you also spies come on come in
[1:08:06] here they are no
[1:08:08] that was not rehab
[1:08:10] praise be to god
[1:08:14] rehearsal spice oh actually they came
[1:08:17] here
[1:08:18] but you know what they just went out
[1:08:20] that way
[1:08:22] right after them just hurry before they
[1:08:24] go
[1:08:26] and he sent them chasing
[1:08:29] after these people
[1:08:33] and then rehab goes in
[1:08:35] rahab had hidden them in the roof
[1:08:39] and then rahab goes up
[1:08:41] and tells them oh
[1:08:44] so you guys are spies after all
[1:08:47] you know what
[1:08:48] that is fine
[1:08:52] god has already given you guys this land
[1:08:57] the god of israel indeed is god
[1:09:01] praise be to god amen
[1:09:04] oh america is making us to see a lot of
[1:09:06] things
[1:09:08] i used to hear about gays and lesbians
[1:09:10] it was here i saw them
[1:09:12] and i used to hear about people saying i
[1:09:14] don't believe there is god i don't
[1:09:16] believe that is god it's here i actually
[1:09:19] saw somebody with my eyes
[1:09:21] telling me he doesn't believe in the
[1:09:23] existence of god
[1:09:29] rehab said
[1:09:32] god has given you the land
[1:09:35] the god of israel indeed is god
[1:09:39] oh yes we are worshipping the living god
[1:09:43] amen there is no god like unto jehovah
[1:09:48] he is the lord of lords and the king of
[1:09:50] kings
[1:09:51] the almighty god
[1:09:53] there has never been anyone like unto
[1:09:56] him
[1:09:57] never before nobody before him nobody
[1:10:00] beside him and nobody after him he is
[1:10:03] the one and only sovereign authority
[1:10:05] there is and the one and only sovereign
[1:10:08] authority that would ever be
[1:10:10] the almighty god
[1:10:12] praise be to god that is the god we are
[1:10:14] serving
[1:10:17] we are not serving any i mean any
[1:10:20] ordinary we are serving the almighty god
[1:10:23] he said the lord your god he is god and
[1:10:26] god has given you the land
[1:10:28] you know what
[1:10:32] we heard of the wonders
[1:10:34] the miracles god has done
[1:10:37] for you guys
[1:10:40] and we know that god is with you
[1:10:44] you know
[1:10:45] egypt in those days was a superpower
[1:10:50] the way america would sneeze
[1:10:52] and all other countries would begin
[1:10:54] coughing
[1:10:55] that was the way it was
[1:10:57] with egypt
[1:11:00] that when pharaoh spoke
[1:11:02] they listened
[1:11:04] it was a superpower
[1:11:06] and rehab said we we heard
[1:11:09] of how
[1:11:11] a man by the name moses
[1:11:13] went before the pharaoh and delivered
[1:11:15] the children of israel it was not by
[1:11:17] fighter jets
[1:11:19] it was not by armored tanks
[1:11:22] there were no there were no men in boots
[1:11:26] he just went with his crooked staff and
[1:11:29] thus says the lord
[1:11:31] praise be to god
[1:11:33] and he delivered them
[1:11:35] we heard of it and how god dried the red
[1:11:38] sea and you guys went on a dry ground
[1:11:42] and how pharaoh and his smell got
[1:11:45] drowned in the midst of the red sea
[1:11:48] and we heard of how god took care of you
[1:11:50] people
[1:11:51] in the wilderness
[1:11:53] we also heard
[1:11:54] what you guys did to the kick that to
[1:11:56] the two kings on the other side of
[1:11:58] jordan
[1:12:00] and when we heard that you guys were
[1:12:02] just across the jordan there is no man
[1:12:06] left here in this city
[1:12:10] all our hearts
[1:12:12] melted
[1:12:15] there is no man
[1:12:17] left
[1:12:19] our house melted within us
[1:12:23] and god has given you guys this land
[1:12:27] but you know what
[1:12:28] i want you to make me a promise
[1:12:33] i want you to give me a talking
[1:12:37] that me and my father's house
[1:12:40] we shall be saved
[1:12:43] when god gives you this land
[1:12:45] it's just a matter of time that me and
[1:12:48] my father's house we shall be saved i
[1:12:51] want the talking and you are not just
[1:12:53] going to give me any promise you are
[1:12:55] going to swear
[1:12:57] i am going to make you swear
[1:12:59] by the god
[1:13:01] you believe amen
[1:13:04] remember these are people who know that
[1:13:07] you will not take the name of the lord
[1:13:09] in vain
[1:13:11] narrow them to the corner
[1:13:14] praise be to god
[1:13:18] they said okay
[1:13:21] you know what
[1:13:23] if you do not tell the people our
[1:13:25] business
[1:13:28] we are bound
[1:13:30] to this earth
[1:13:32] you are going to make us take
[1:13:35] but if you tell them
[1:13:40] of our business
[1:13:41] we are not bound to it in any way
[1:13:46] but if you keep it a secret
[1:13:50] our life for yours
[1:13:52] if we do not keep this oath
[1:13:59] and rahab was not just asking for
[1:14:01] herself
[1:14:04] not for not just for me
[1:14:08] not just for me
[1:14:10] but just think about it
[1:14:12] now when the spice went to the land they
[1:14:14] didn't go to the chief's palace they
[1:14:16] didn't go to the politicians they didn't
[1:14:18] go to the rich man but to a harlot
[1:14:22] a woman of ill faith
[1:14:29] a harlot
[1:14:31] who was making life of herself
[1:14:36] somebody you readily despised
[1:14:43] once a child of god you are always a
[1:14:46] child of god
[1:14:48] nothing can change your identity
[1:14:52] nothing there is nothing in this life
[1:14:55] there is nothing in the life to come
[1:14:57] that can change your identity
[1:15:00] and the things you go through in this
[1:15:02] life
[1:15:03] can never
[1:15:04] change
[1:15:05] who you are
[1:15:09] who you are is already locked in
[1:15:13] the things you go through in this life
[1:15:16] do not determine
[1:15:18] who you really are no
[1:15:22] she was living in filth
[1:15:25] in a very disgraceful profession you can
[1:15:28] say
[1:15:30] but yet
[1:15:33] there was a part of god in here
[1:15:38] there is no amount of prostitution that
[1:15:40] can take it away
[1:15:43] there is no amount of filth that can
[1:15:46] take it away
[1:15:49] that seed of life
[1:15:51] in hell
[1:15:53] could never be corrupted
[1:15:58] that god looks down
[1:16:00] in spite of the filth and the mess in
[1:16:03] jericho god looks down and said this is
[1:16:05] my daughter
[1:16:07] and nothing could change it
[1:16:09] praise be to god
[1:16:13] and rahab was not asking just for
[1:16:15] herself
[1:16:19] there shouldn't be selfishness in the
[1:16:20] kingdom of god
[1:16:23] i believe
[1:16:26] that what rehab was doing the parents
[1:16:27] were not proud of her
[1:16:30] every parent wants to see their child or
[1:16:33] their children get better than them
[1:16:36] and then you get you give birth to a
[1:16:38] child and they go they go to school and
[1:16:42] they refuse to work and that is what
[1:16:43] they want to do
[1:16:45] it's a reproach to the family
[1:16:49] there is no family that will stand for
[1:16:51] that and i believe
[1:16:53] that what rehab was doing the parents
[1:16:55] were not happy with her they were not
[1:16:57] satisfied with her and rahab knew that
[1:16:59] better
[1:17:02] probably the rehab class said oh yes
[1:17:05] now
[1:17:06] there is a lifeline here
[1:17:08] that i am going to live and would not
[1:17:10] die with the rest of these people
[1:17:13] and you know what this is a good time to
[1:17:16] pay my parents back
[1:17:18] for all the years of persecution
[1:17:22] for all the years of trouble they have
[1:17:25] given me
[1:17:26] i will make sure they will die with the
[1:17:27] rest of the people no that was not rehab
[1:17:32] there comes a time
[1:17:34] in your life you have to bury the
[1:17:36] hatchets
[1:17:40] you come to that point
[1:17:42] you have to overlook everything
[1:17:46] and behave like a responsible child of
[1:17:48] god
[1:17:51] that not just for me alone but for my
[1:17:54] father for my mother for my siblings
[1:17:58] and they said okay that is all good we
[1:18:01] are going to give you a token
[1:18:05] this is the rope we are going to go down
[1:18:07] with
[1:18:10] and you are going to hang this rope
[1:18:13] on your window
[1:18:15] and that is going to be for a talking
[1:18:18] unto you
[1:18:20] and all your father's house make sure
[1:18:23] that they are here
[1:18:26] if they are not here
[1:18:28] do not blame us
[1:18:31] your blood be upon your own head
[1:18:34] but if you get them here where the token
[1:18:37] has been applied
[1:18:40] our life for yours
[1:18:43] praise be to god
[1:18:47] she got a talking
[1:18:49] and here something else comes up
[1:18:53] that when the spies were living
[1:18:57] rehab tells them
[1:18:59] you guys should hurry
[1:19:00] because the men are on their way looking
[1:19:02] for you
[1:19:04] and hurry up and go to the
[1:19:06] mountains before they meet you on their
[1:19:09] way back
[1:19:11] and when you get to the mountains stay
[1:19:13] there for three days
[1:19:16] till the men are come back before you go
[1:19:20] and i keep thinking about it
[1:19:22] praise be to god
[1:19:24] that this was a woman that was living in
[1:19:28] filth
[1:19:30] complete filth
[1:19:33] and these were men that were sent
[1:19:37] by the prophet of god
[1:19:40] joshua
[1:19:42] and they knew that god was with them
[1:19:45] and yet
[1:19:47] they would listen to this woman
[1:19:51] this woman that was living in so much
[1:19:54] filth
[1:19:56] that was probably a time to tell her who
[1:19:58] are you
[1:20:00] to tell us what to do
[1:20:02] we are serving a living god
[1:20:05] the lord our god is alive
[1:20:07] god is here with us
[1:20:09] god is more than able to take care of us
[1:20:11] who are you a prostitute to tell us what
[1:20:14] to do no they didn't do that
[1:20:19] they heeded to it
[1:20:21] they listened to her
[1:20:23] and they did exactly what she said they
[1:20:25] should do
[1:20:29] pride goes before a fall
[1:20:34] and i can't have been thinking about it
[1:20:37] just think about it
[1:20:40] rehab's life depended on these two spies
[1:20:45] because if she had not crushing them
[1:20:50] and they had fallen in ambush
[1:20:53] and they were arrested and killed
[1:20:56] joshua and his men would not know that
[1:20:59] his spies
[1:21:02] had given somebody a token out there
[1:21:07] they were coming to take everybody down
[1:21:11] their lives depended on rahab rahab's
[1:21:14] life depending on heart and that is how
[1:21:16] it is in the house of god
[1:21:18] our lives depend on one another
[1:21:22] amen you should be happy when somebody
[1:21:24] corrects you
[1:21:27] pride goes before a fall
[1:21:30] there is no arrogance in the kingdom of
[1:21:31] god
[1:21:33] you should be happy
[1:21:35] now somebody sees something wrong with
[1:21:37] your life and the couple can come and
[1:21:39] tell you brother sister oh this this
[1:21:41] that you should be happy they did it
[1:21:46] we are one and the same we belong to the
[1:21:50] same body of christ by one spirit are we
[1:21:53] baptized into one body
[1:21:57] if i see something wrong with your life
[1:21:59] and i can't tell you that means there is
[1:22:00] something wrong with me
[1:22:03] and if i tell you
[1:22:05] and you don't take it
[1:22:07] check your life sometimes we live so
[1:22:13] much in the flesh
[1:22:15] till when we see something wrong or
[1:22:18] somebody tells us something wrong with
[1:22:20] our lives
[1:22:23] we become so defensive
[1:22:26] so so defensive
[1:22:28] and all we see is the negative side
[1:22:32] we never see anything positive
[1:22:35] all we see is the negative
[1:22:38] why because we are living so much in the
[1:22:41] flesh
[1:22:42] it's time to get out
[1:22:45] get out
[1:22:47] for we have a place to go
[1:22:51] if you live in the flesh to to too much
[1:22:53] you are going to die
[1:23:00] and they listened
[1:23:06] all right i have had to do
[1:23:10] apply the token
[1:23:13] it's one thing having the token
[1:23:16] and it's another thing applying the
[1:23:18] token
[1:23:19] if you have the token
[1:23:22] and you don't apply the talking
[1:23:25] it's as bad as not having it
[1:23:29] you can also have the token and apply it
[1:23:33] wrongly
[1:23:36] just imagine
[1:23:38] despite selling rehab applied the token
[1:23:41] on on the window and the rehab text and
[1:23:44] said no
[1:23:45] it has to be it has to be on the door
[1:23:48] guess what is going to happen
[1:23:51] it is not what you think it's what god
[1:23:54] wants amen
[1:24:02] now remember
[1:24:07] when rahab applied the token
[1:24:10] now she had to get her parents under the
[1:24:12] same roof
[1:24:17] i don't think
[1:24:18] rahab went to that father and said daddy
[1:24:21] you know what two spies came here they
[1:24:23] are going to destroy this city you guys
[1:24:25] come with me and they just got up and
[1:24:26] followed no
[1:24:28] i don't think that was what happened
[1:24:32] especially
[1:24:33] for an ill-fated woman
[1:24:36] who had gone against the family values
[1:24:41] whose parents were not happy with her
[1:24:44] i don't think it was going to be easy
[1:24:48] i believe the first time he went she
[1:24:50] went
[1:24:51] the parents may have sent her packing
[1:24:53] come on get away from here
[1:24:55] what are you talking about how do you
[1:24:56] know and she may have left
[1:25:00] but here she comes again

[1:25:19] talking about this is a mighty city look

[1:25:27] secure in this world he said no daddy
[1:25:31] these walls are coming down
[1:25:33] i don't know how
[1:25:34] but i know they are coming down
[1:25:39] and she goes away
[1:25:41] maybe she comes again
[1:25:43] probably
[1:25:46] rehab's parents
[1:25:48] may have seen her once every six months
[1:25:52] but for the first time they are seeing
[1:25:54] her five six times a day
[1:25:57] ah what is wrong
[1:25:59] there must be something about what she
[1:26:01] is saying
[1:26:03] and then before the aware she is taking
[1:26:05] off the paint the paint on her lips oh
[1:26:09] praise be to god
[1:26:13] the pain she's taking off the pens
[1:26:16] all those
[1:26:19] miniskirts she's throwing them away
[1:26:23] they show your back and show your front
[1:26:24] she's throwing them away
[1:26:27] and she's beginning to dress a long
[1:26:29] skirt responsible
[1:26:34] and she's coming around the family
[1:26:37] not talking about anything
[1:26:40] but daddy mommy this city is going down
[1:26:43] we have a promise
[1:26:45] we have a promise
[1:26:46] trying to get them together under the
[1:26:48] same roof
[1:26:49] and they may have looked at her and
[1:26:51] looked at her and said you know what
[1:26:53] there is something
[1:26:55] about her something has changed
[1:26:59] something she is no longer the same
[1:27:01] person we used to know
[1:27:03] something has changed you know what
[1:27:06] the best witness you have
[1:27:09] is your life amen
[1:27:12] it is not so much about what you tell
[1:27:15] people
[1:27:16] they are watching every single step you
[1:27:19] take
[1:27:21] your life is a witness unto the people
[1:27:26] if you profess 110 and you're doing
[1:27:28] another thing
[1:27:31] you weakened
[1:27:33] your testimony
[1:27:36] they looked at her
[1:27:38] and said no
[1:27:39] actually something has changed
[1:27:42] it's time we begin to listen to her
[1:27:45] and then they went
[1:27:47] and then sat in the room
[1:27:49] the room there's so much hater to go and
[1:27:51] now they define themselves
[1:27:53] because that is where the token has been
[1:27:55] applied
[1:27:56] and that is the only place that is safe
[1:27:59] the only place that is safe
[1:28:02] is where the token has been applied
[1:28:05] any other place
[1:28:08] is a dangerous ground
[1:28:11] they may have sat down
[1:28:13] rehab
[1:28:15] when are the people coming
[1:28:16] rehab open at the window i don't know
[1:28:19] but i know they are coming
[1:28:21] and they may have sat down sat down sat
[1:28:23] down
[1:28:24] they said
[1:28:26] you know
[1:28:27] the chief's palace is probably the most
[1:28:29] fortified place why don't you go and
[1:28:31] look for a place there
[1:28:33] and really said no
[1:28:35] the only safe grounds is here
[1:28:37] under the toki
[1:28:39] praise be to god
[1:28:41] it's not what you think it's not what
[1:28:43] you can imagine
[1:28:45] it's what the word of god says
[1:28:47] praise be to god
[1:28:50] and then they were there
[1:28:52] and we know the story
[1:28:55] how the children of israel crossed the
[1:28:57] jordan
[1:28:58] came
[1:28:59] spent time in the plains of jordan
[1:29:02] i
[1:29:04] jericho um
[1:29:06] joshua had to circumcise all the
[1:29:08] children because of all the two million
[1:29:11] people that came out of egypt only two
[1:29:13] survived
[1:29:14] every one of them died
[1:29:16] only their children crossed over
[1:29:19] and they had to be circumcised they
[1:29:21] waited till they got healed and god told
[1:29:23] them what to do how they marched around
[1:29:25] the city marched around the wall
[1:29:28] and probably people
[1:29:30] the first day they marched around
[1:29:32] people had their boots on the ground
[1:29:34] and then it died out
[1:29:37] they may be inside jubilating
[1:29:40] oh yes
[1:29:41] they are outside they can't come in oh
[1:29:44] we are safe
[1:29:45] what a mighty fortress we have
[1:29:48] oh this was a big
[1:29:50] there is no army that can cross this
[1:29:51] wall
[1:29:53] they didn't know what god was doing
[1:29:55] praise be to god
[1:29:57] they were trusting in their technology
[1:29:59] technology of that day
[1:30:01] god was doing something that the human
[1:30:04] eye
[1:30:05] was not seeing that the human mind could
[1:30:08] not comprehend
[1:30:09] the second day they went again
[1:30:12] and i believe rehab will look to the
[1:30:14] window say praise god
[1:30:17] they are here every time it will be over
[1:30:20] i don't know how
[1:30:21] but i know
[1:30:23] that it will be over because i believe
[1:30:24] in their god
[1:30:26] and we know how the words of jericho
[1:30:28] came down they went in and killed
[1:30:29] everybody
[1:30:31] except
[1:30:32] rahab
[1:30:33] the father the mother
[1:30:35] and the siblings
[1:30:38] why
[1:30:39] because they applied the token
[1:30:45] remember we are talking about what
[1:30:48] they're talking about
[1:30:50] they're talking
[1:30:51] they applied the token
[1:30:54] a child of god wherever you find
[1:30:56] yourself
[1:30:58] remember
[1:30:59] that your god is with you
[1:31:05] i will be with you i will never forsake
[1:31:08] you
[1:31:10] god has promised to be with us always
[1:31:13] and never forsake
[1:31:14] us it is a promise
[1:31:18] whatever situation you find yourself in
[1:31:20] whatever condition you find yourself in
[1:31:22] remember that god is with you
[1:31:25] the eyes of god are focused on you
[1:31:29] in every single step you take
[1:31:32] you may fall here you may rise up there
[1:31:35] your things may go wrong today tomorrow
[1:31:38] you don't even know where you are but
[1:31:40] the fact that you are a child of god the
[1:31:42] eyes of god are on you
[1:31:46] there is nothing you can do about it
[1:31:49] because you belong to god
[1:31:52] you are a part of him
[1:31:54] god cannot afford to lose you
[1:31:57] no way
[1:32:01] and god has always made a provision for
[1:32:03] his children
[1:32:07] god told abraham
[1:32:10] that your seed after you've been in a
[1:32:11] strange land for 400 years and after
[1:32:14] that i will come and deliver them by a
[1:32:16] mighty right hand
[1:32:18] and god is a promiscuity in god
[1:32:21] he kept his promise
[1:32:24] we know the story i don't want to go so
[1:32:27] much into it but we know the story
[1:32:29] how god spoke to moses
[1:32:32] and moses goes to egypt
[1:32:35] we know all
[1:32:37] the drama that unfolded between moses uh
[1:32:40] and aaron and and and pharaoh and his
[1:32:42] people
[1:32:44] and and and pharaoh was so so stubborn
[1:32:47] as we all know
[1:32:48] but look when you get to a place and you
[1:32:51] have to stop one god has a surprise for
[1:32:52] you
[1:32:57] yes
[1:32:59] not just for the for the unbeliever even
[1:33:02] for a child of god when you are too
[1:33:04] stubborn god has a surprise for you
[1:33:09] and you don't want to fall in the hands
[1:33:11] of god
[1:33:13] he is a merciful god yes
[1:33:17] he is merciful
[1:33:20] remember he is the same no no since god
[1:33:22] he has not changed
[1:33:24] the bible says
[1:33:26] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:33:28] forever he changed off note
[1:33:33] that no nonsense god is the god we are
[1:33:35] talking about
[1:33:36] but there is blood on the seats
[1:33:39] there is blood on that seat
[1:33:42] that has turned that judgment seat into
[1:33:44] a mercy seat
[1:33:46] don't think that god is weak
[1:33:49] god is not weak and he is not slack
[1:33:52] concerning his promises
[1:33:56] it's just for the sake of the blood
[1:34:05] pharaoh thought he was stubborn
[1:34:08] but god had a message for him
[1:34:12] and
[1:34:13] god told moses and aaron
[1:34:16] to tell the congregation of israel
[1:34:21] to get a for each family to get a lamb
[1:34:25] and the lamb should be without blemish
[1:34:29] without spots
[1:34:30] without every family
[1:34:33] and while the families are small two
[1:34:35] families can come together
[1:34:37] and then kill a lamb
[1:34:39] and that was not the end of story
[1:34:42] god told them what to do not to cook it
[1:34:44] to water to roast it with her what have
[1:34:46] you um how does she ate standing in
[1:34:50] readiness to move
[1:34:52] there was no time to waste
[1:34:55] they were ready to get out
[1:34:59] and god told them
[1:35:01] to apply
[1:35:04] the blood
[1:35:06] to the lentil post
[1:35:08] of the door
[1:35:10] because that same night he was going to
[1:35:12] go through the land
[1:35:14] and he was going to break judgment
[1:35:18] upon the children of egypt
[1:35:21] and when he sees the blood
[1:35:24] he will pass
[1:35:26] over when i see the blood i will pass
[1:35:30] over you
[1:35:32] god gave it to them as a sign
[1:35:34] that was the token god gave to them
[1:35:37] that when i see the blood i will pass
[1:35:40] away
[1:35:41] i will pass over you
[1:35:44] but anywhere the blood was not applied
[1:35:46] god was going in there
[1:35:48] and nothing but judgment awaited them
[1:35:52] and you could tell yourself oh i am a
[1:35:55] hebrew i am a hebrew of hebrews
[1:35:59] you know what i am not going to apply
[1:36:01] the blood and i am safe
[1:36:03] and you know that you told a lie
[1:36:07] you go kill the lamb all right and eat
[1:36:09] the meat and not apply the blood
[1:36:11] you are in danger
[1:36:14] and the word of god told them where to
[1:36:16] apply the blood
[1:36:20] you could take the blood and put it
[1:36:22] spread it on your mattress
[1:36:24] and then light and cover yourself in the
[1:36:26] blood
[1:36:31] was that going to take the judgment away
[1:36:33] no way
[1:36:34] it has to be according to god's provided
[1:36:38] way yes sir
[1:36:40] it is either according to god's provided
[1:36:42] way
[1:36:43] or you have lost it
[1:36:47] it may not make sense to you
[1:36:50] it doesn't have to make sense to you
[1:36:53] that is what god wants
[1:36:55] and you as a child of god that is what
[1:36:57] you have to do
[1:36:59] to be at peace with god you have to do
[1:37:02] what god wants not what you want
[1:37:05] not what you think is right
[1:37:11] it has to be
[1:37:12] according to god's provided way
[1:37:18] and that night
[1:37:21] god went through the land
[1:37:23] and he struck the first born
[1:37:26] of every creature
[1:37:28] starting from pharaoh to his servant
[1:37:32] and every beast
[1:37:33] and there was a great cry
[1:37:35] on the land
[1:37:38] there was a great cry
[1:37:41] but wherever the blood was applied
[1:37:44] wherever the token was applied
[1:37:49] god
[1:37:50] did not go in there he passed over
[1:37:55] the token
[1:37:56] was applied
[1:37:59] remember it's one thing having the token
[1:38:02] and it's another thing applying the
[1:38:04] token
[1:38:05] and again
[1:38:07] is another thing applying the talking
[1:38:09] rightly and it's another thing
[1:38:12] applying it wrongly
[1:38:16] you can apply the token
[1:38:19] and wrongly apply it
[1:38:22] and you are in danger all the same
[1:38:27] they're talking
[1:38:29] praise be to god
[1:38:32] and as god
[1:38:35] mentioned
[1:38:36] that he took care of rahab
[1:38:38] that rehab was given a token
[1:38:42] and god gave the children of israel a
[1:38:45] talking
[1:38:46] in this day and age also god has given
[1:38:49] us a token amen praise be to god
[1:38:54] rehab
[1:38:55] received
[1:38:56] the messengers
[1:38:58] of her day
[1:39:01] she believed in the message of her hour
[1:39:06] she believed it
[1:39:10] and the bible says by faith
[1:39:12] rhea believed
[1:39:14] and she was not destroyed or condemned
[1:39:17] with the rest of the the people of
[1:39:19] jericho
[1:39:23] recognizing your day and your message
[1:39:27] is very very crucial it's very very
[1:39:30] important
[1:39:33] that we have not believed canningly
[1:39:35] devised tables
[1:39:38] it's not the intelligence of men
[1:39:44] believing
[1:39:46] the message of your day
[1:39:50] accepting
[1:39:52] the messengers god has sent to you
[1:39:58] it's a very very very a lot of time we
[1:40:00] we we we we under look
[1:40:03] we underestimate
[1:40:08] who we are
[1:40:11] and how far god has brought us
[1:40:14] why is it that a lot of people hear this
[1:40:17] message you have heard
[1:40:19] and to some people it has become a law
[1:40:22] to some people it has become do's and
[1:40:25] don'ts but for you it's a joy
[1:40:28] to live by those things
[1:40:32] that you don't see it as a burden
[1:40:35] that you just love it you have fallen in
[1:40:38] love with it
[1:40:40] now people look at your life in the
[1:40:42] marvel
[1:40:43] don't you think you're punishing
[1:40:44] yourself too much
[1:40:47] no it's a joy
[1:40:48] i just love it
[1:40:50] i don't see
[1:40:51] i mean it's a joy
[1:40:55] praise be to god
[1:40:58] we are talking about the token
[1:41:04] the bible says in sin did my mother
[1:41:07] conceive me
[1:41:08] and in iniquity was i shaping
[1:41:12] every human being that was born
[1:41:15] after the likeness of man and woman was
[1:41:18] born into sin
[1:41:20] you didn't have to tell the first lie
[1:41:22] you were already sin as sinner before
[1:41:25] you came
[1:41:27] and the penalty for sin is
[1:41:30] death that is the penalty for sin
[1:41:33] is death
[1:41:35] that was why when sin came into the
[1:41:37] garden
[1:41:39] god himself
[1:41:41] had to kill an innocent lamb
[1:41:44] an innocent lamb had to die
[1:41:47] for adam and eve to live
[1:41:51] and the bible says without a shedding of
[1:41:53] blood
[1:41:54] there is no forgiveness of sin
[1:41:56] why
[1:41:58] because the fall had everything to do
[1:42:01] with the intermingling of blood
[1:42:06] it had everything to do with blood
[1:42:10] i remember in those days in the church
[1:42:12] of um in the roman catholic church
[1:42:15] uh they would tell us oh it was an apple
[1:42:17] it was an apple it was an apple
[1:42:19] and what have you
[1:42:22] and we believed you so much
[1:42:27] and for a very very long time
[1:42:30] the devil was hiding under the apple
[1:42:32] tree
[1:42:34] praise be to god god sent his prophet
[1:42:38] to approach that tree
[1:42:42] then now we know
[1:42:43] that it was not an apple
[1:42:46] it was not an apple
[1:42:50] praise be to god
[1:42:52] that it was more than apple
[1:42:56] i remember when i came to the message
[1:42:58] the first time
[1:42:59] i went to church and i heard it preached
[1:43:03] the serpent's seat
[1:43:06] oh my goodness i said what is this
[1:43:09] as i never had this anyway in my life
[1:43:13] i'm not going to go that way because
[1:43:14] there is a whole sermon on its own
[1:43:19] i went to the house i couldn't reconcile
[1:43:21] it
[1:43:24] but
[1:43:25] something says stay away
[1:43:29] that is not a place you want to go
[1:43:32] i said no
[1:43:33] all my life
[1:43:35] i have been looking for a message
[1:43:38] if you asked me what i was looking for i
[1:43:40] couldn't tell you honestly speaking
[1:43:44] i was a muslim before i became a muslim
[1:43:46] i was a catholic i became a muslim i
[1:43:49] went to the church of pentecost i won to
[1:43:51] church of the apostolic church
[1:43:53] and and came back i was not just
[1:43:56] satisfied there was something i was
[1:43:58] looking for
[1:44:00] what it was i didn't know
[1:44:03] until one night
[1:44:06] i had a word priest it was a crusade and
[1:44:10] as a matter of fact they had finished
[1:44:12] preaching
[1:44:13] and when i got there the preacher was
[1:44:16] just recapping what he had already
[1:44:19] preached so i just stood there for that
[1:44:21] five minutes i stood there i said oh my
[1:44:23] goodness this is what i've been looking
[1:44:25] for
[1:44:28] i said this is what i've been looking
[1:44:29] for
[1:44:31] i had a muslim friend he was my
[1:44:32] colleague when they say we were
[1:44:33] roommates
[1:44:35] and i went to the camp i said muhammad i
[1:44:38] said i have been looking for something
[1:44:39] all these years as i just found it
[1:44:43] praise be to god
[1:44:45] and now i go to the church and they are
[1:44:46] talking about serpent seed i said what
[1:44:48] is this
[1:44:51] and the devil tells me you are the wrong
[1:44:53] place
[1:44:54] this is not the place you want to be i
[1:44:56] said no
[1:44:58] this is what i have been looking for
[1:45:01] i said no there must be something here
[1:45:04] it took me time
[1:45:06] but i remember
[1:45:09] one morning
[1:45:10] around 12 a.m
[1:45:13] i was sitting down
[1:45:15] i was just reading
[1:45:17] reading
[1:45:18] reading and my goodness
[1:45:21] the picture came so clear
[1:45:25] and when god created the heavens and the
[1:45:27] earth
[1:45:28] he did not create enough demons to take
[1:45:31] that away from me
[1:45:34] praise be to god
[1:45:37] there are not enough demons in hell that
[1:45:40] can take that away from me and i'm
[1:45:42] saying that to the glory of god
[1:45:48] god
[1:45:49] has made provisions
[1:45:53] and sometimes we sit down and we cry we
[1:45:56] throw our hands we receive i see i mean
[1:45:59] we throw our hands up in despair and i
[1:46:01] wonder what god god thinks when he looks
[1:46:04] down and he sees us in that mode
[1:46:09] children with authority children with
[1:46:12] power
[1:46:14] and yet we sit down
[1:46:15] and we allow the devil to just come
[1:46:17] around and misbehave with us
[1:46:21] stand your ground
[1:46:24] stand your ground
[1:46:27] praise be to god
[1:46:29] you are a child of god
[1:46:32] brother branham said
[1:46:34] that when you believe the word of god
[1:46:36] and you put the same word on your mouth
[1:46:38] and you speak it it's like daisy
[1:46:40] speaking
[1:46:42] it's as good as god himself speaking his
[1:46:45] word
[1:46:49] and when when the devil came to the lord
[1:46:52] jesus to tempt him of all the powers he
[1:46:55] had he didn't use any of them he just
[1:46:57] used the word it is written it's written
[1:47:00] it's written
[1:47:01] it's for our admonition
[1:47:05] just speak the
[1:47:06] word speak the word
[1:47:11] speak the word
[1:47:14] oh praise be to god
[1:47:17] we are talking about
[1:47:19] the token
[1:47:22] that every man that was born into this
[1:47:24] world was born into sin and a penalty
[1:47:26] for sin
[1:47:28] is death
[1:47:30] and for man to live god himself had to
[1:47:32] provide
[1:47:34] a
[1:47:34] sacrifice an innocent lamb had to die
[1:47:38] for adam and eve to live
[1:47:41] and in the old testament it was an
[1:47:43] ordinance god gave to the children of
[1:47:44] israel
[1:47:47] there was a safe offering
[1:47:49] that when the committee sinned there was
[1:47:51] a time they had to come with a lamb an
[1:47:53] innocent lamb
[1:47:55] they would come and confess their sins
[1:47:57] before the priests put your hands on
[1:47:59] this innocent animal and they will
[1:48:01] confess their sins and this animal is
[1:48:03] slaughtered
[1:48:04] it will just shake shake shake and bleed
[1:48:06] and die and they know that the animal is
[1:48:09] dying in their place
[1:48:12] that they were supposed to die
[1:48:14] but the animal has taken the place
[1:48:19] and that is why they are life
[1:48:22] and it is the same way
[1:48:25] physically and spiritually
[1:48:28] for you to live something must die
[1:48:32] for you to live something must die
[1:48:37] the cow has to die
[1:48:39] you can't catch a big cow and put it in
[1:48:40] a pot and cook it
[1:48:42] i want to see that pot
[1:48:47] for you to live the corn must die
[1:48:50] and so it is spiritually
[1:48:55] for them to live
[1:48:57] an innocent lamb had to die it was not
[1:49:00] god's perfect will
[1:49:02] but god permitted it
[1:49:05] and this was heralding
[1:49:08] the perfect sacrifice that was yet to
[1:49:10] come
[1:49:14] praise be to god
[1:49:17] the bible says for god so loved the
[1:49:18] world that he gave us his only begotten
[1:49:20] son now whosoever believeth in him
[1:49:23] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:49:25] life
[1:49:26] in the book of revelations
[1:49:28] when john
[1:49:30] the elder told john who is worried to
[1:49:32] take the book and to losing the sister
[1:49:35] of and john saw that there was nobody
[1:49:37] and he started crying
[1:49:39] the angel came back and said john do not
[1:49:41] cry the elder said john do not cry
[1:49:44] for for for the lion of the trap of
[1:49:47] judah has prevailed
[1:49:49] to take the book
[1:49:51] and to losing the seals
[1:49:53] thereof
[1:49:55] and when he looked what did he see a
[1:49:57] bloody lump
[1:49:58] a bloody lamb in the midst of the throne
[1:50:01] god provided himself a sacrifice there
[1:50:04] was no man that was worthy
[1:50:08] and when john the baptist saw him he
[1:50:10] said behold the lamb of god that takes
[1:50:13] away the sins of the world
[1:50:15] praise be to god he was our sin offering
[1:50:20] he was our sin offering he was our
[1:50:23] passover lamb
[1:50:25] that all our sins my sins and your sins
[1:50:29] and our iniquities yes because the bible
[1:50:32] says in the book of isaiah
[1:50:34] that he was wounded for our
[1:50:35] transgressions and he was bruised for
[1:50:38] our iniquities and this excitement of
[1:50:40] our peace was laid upon him
[1:50:43] and by his stripes we are healed and
[1:50:46] brother says
[1:50:47] that
[1:50:48] healing healing and
[1:50:50] salvation and healing come hand in hand
[1:50:54] praise be to god
[1:50:57] that on the cross
[1:50:59] when he lay there dying
[1:51:03] my sins
[1:51:05] and your sins
[1:51:08] were upon him
[1:51:12] he never committed any sin
[1:51:14] he knew no sin
[1:51:17] he was tempted in everything as branham
[1:51:19] says
[1:51:20] but he never sinned in anything
[1:51:27] he became sin
[1:51:30] who knew no sin
[1:51:32] that we should become the very
[1:51:34] righteousness of god
[1:51:38] for your sake and for my sake
[1:51:41] god has to leave his throne above
[1:51:44] and to take upon himself
[1:51:48] a flesh
[1:51:51] and to walk this earth surface
[1:51:53] and to go through all the things he went
[1:51:56] through
[1:51:57] just for you and me
[1:51:59] and when you turn this down what else is
[1:52:03] there
[1:52:04] by the judgment of god
[1:52:06] if you can turn the grace of god down
[1:52:08] what else is there by the judgment of
[1:52:10] god
[1:52:12] if you turn this grace down there is
[1:52:14] nothing left for you
[1:52:16] i'm not scaring you i'm telling you the
[1:52:18] truth
[1:52:22] if god had not made a way it is
[1:52:24] completely different
[1:52:27] but when he has already made a way
[1:52:31] he has made a way
[1:52:33] and you despise it
[1:52:36] there is nothing left for you
[1:52:38] but the judgment of god
[1:52:43] that on the cross
[1:52:45] he was carrying my sins
[1:52:48] on the cross he was carrying your sins
[1:52:51] praise be to god
[1:52:53] praise be to god
[1:52:55] that he died in our place
[1:52:58] and when he started with a loud voice it
[1:53:01] is finished it was indeed finished
[1:53:04] praise be to god
[1:53:06] it was finished
[1:53:09] the same question was settled
[1:53:11] the price was paid
[1:53:13] because the bible says that we are
[1:53:15] bought and paid
[1:53:17] with a price
[1:53:20] with a price
[1:53:23] the price was paid
[1:53:28] we are talking
[1:53:30] about the token
[1:53:32] and what is the token
[1:53:34] verbal said a token is a sign
[1:53:38] that the price has been paid
[1:53:42] a sign
[1:53:44] that the price
[1:53:46] has been paid
[1:53:48] the proof
[1:53:49] that the price is paid
[1:53:52] praise be to god the evidence
[1:53:56] that the price has been paid
[1:54:01] now
[1:54:03] if i go to minas
[1:54:06] and i go and buy
[1:54:08] um
[1:54:10] an oven
[1:54:12] for ten thousand dollars
[1:54:19] praise be to god
[1:54:21] that must be a very big oven
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:28] i don't see it entering any home
[1:54:31] you will have to put it out
[1:54:33] for the rain to beat it and for the snow
[1:54:35] to come down on it
[1:54:37] yes now
[1:54:40] you don't have to be there
[1:54:42] to believe that i indeed
[1:54:44] bought an oven
[1:54:46] right
[1:54:48] i can come with a receipt
[1:54:52] and then show it to you and you can see
[1:54:55] my name
[1:54:56] on it and you can see
[1:54:58] ten thousand dollars that is a price
[1:55:01] that was paid for it
[1:55:02] and you can see what item i bought
[1:55:05] uh an oven and you can see the brand
[1:55:09] and you have not seen the oven
[1:55:12] but
[1:55:13] you have seen the proof
[1:55:16] that an oven has been paid for
[1:55:20] i have an evidence
[1:55:24] oh i remember years ago i would sit
[1:55:26] right there and i would listen to
[1:55:28] brother brother brother steve giving his
[1:55:30] yearly yearly
[1:55:31] annual report god bless you brother
[1:55:33] steve
[1:55:38] and then i will see
[1:55:41] one dollar fifty cents
[1:55:45] one dollar seventy three cents
[1:55:48] three dollars fifty cents
[1:55:50] and i'm wondering so he takes receipt
[1:55:52] for all these things
[1:55:54] what
[1:55:56] if i was in his shoes i'll be in trouble
[1:56:00] because i can guarantee you one thing
[1:56:02] that anything less than fifty dollars
[1:56:04] you don't get a receipt for it
[1:56:11] anything
[1:56:12] hundred and 100 plus yes i'll take a
[1:56:15] receipt
[1:56:16] anything between 50 and 100
[1:56:19] i'll use my discretion
[1:56:23] it's either you believe me
[1:56:28] oh you have to get me a whip
[1:56:32] yeah god knows how to get his work done
[1:56:35] he knows
[1:56:37] you know where to place the people
[1:56:40] yes so when i come with a receipt
[1:56:45] and you see there is a proof of payment
[1:56:47] even though i have not seen it you have
[1:56:49] not seen it but you can see the proof
[1:56:52] and now
[1:56:53] i don't care how useless
[1:56:56] how useless how useless
[1:57:00] the oven is
[1:57:03] i don't care how useless it is
[1:57:05] if i pay ten thousand dollars for it
[1:57:09] it shows that
[1:57:11] the value of it
[1:57:13] is ten thousand dollars
[1:57:16] you may not buy it for a cent
[1:57:19] but to me
[1:57:21] that is ten thousand dollars i don't
[1:57:24] have that ten dollars ten thousand
[1:57:26] dollars in cash anymore
[1:57:28] but when i look at the oven
[1:57:31] i see that in my watch ten thousand
[1:57:33] dollars
[1:57:35] praise be to god
[1:57:37] does it surprise you when the bible says
[1:57:40] that we are made joint health with
[1:57:42] christ
[1:57:43] we are made joint health
[1:57:47] praise be to god
[1:57:48] because his blood is flowing through us
[1:57:52] we are the blood of his blood both of
[1:57:54] his bones
[1:57:55] the life of his life
[1:57:59] praise be to god amen
[1:58:04] we are a royal seed
[1:58:08] praise be to god
[1:58:10] joint house
[1:58:12] with christ
[1:58:14] that when god looks down he doesn't see
[1:58:17] you as you oh he sees is the blood of
[1:58:20] redemption
[1:58:24] brother abraham says in the message
[1:58:26] i'm not sure if this is i don't think
[1:58:28] it's in this very message but he says
[1:58:30] that all of 150 pound man his weight is
[1:58:34] 84 cents
[1:58:36] 84 cents
[1:58:39] now if there was a market for human meat
[1:58:44] and then you catch me
[1:58:46] and you butcher me
[1:58:48] and you put me on a plate
[1:58:51] all you get 84 cents
[1:58:56] you'll be lucky to get something a
[1:58:57] little more
[1:59:05] that your soul
[1:59:08] in one place in other places it says 10
[1:59:11] million of this world in other places it
[1:59:14] says ten thousands of this world
[1:59:18] that is how much your soul is worth
[1:59:22] and then you think of a body that is
[1:59:24] just for 84 cents
[1:59:27] with something in that body that is
[1:59:30] white ten thousands of this world
[1:59:32] my goodness
[1:59:34] oh
[1:59:35] praise be to god i pray god we just open
[1:59:38] our eyes to see and to know who we
[1:59:40] really are
[1:59:41] that you are not just anybody but that
[1:59:44] you are a child of god with promise
[1:59:47] that you are carrying the safety of god
[1:59:49] in you
[1:59:51] you are not like any other person don't
[1:59:53] look at other people in the street i
[1:59:54] think they are better than you or you
[1:59:56] think
[1:59:58] lord have mercy
[2:00:01] lord have mercy
[2:00:03] praise be to god
[2:00:07] there is something in you
[2:00:10] something in you that is worth
[2:00:13] ten thousands or if you want you can
[2:00:15] even take the ten millions
[2:00:17] of this world we are living in
[2:00:22] it is not you
[2:00:24] it's not you it's the blood that has
[2:00:27] redeemed your soul
[2:00:31] the blood of our redemption
[2:00:33] you can't put a price on it
[2:00:36] praise be to god
[2:00:40] don't forget we are talking about
[2:00:42] the token
[2:00:45] he shed his blood
[2:00:48] he shed his blood for us
[2:00:51] we have been redeemed by his blood
[2:00:56] and barbara said his blood is the token
[2:00:59] his blood is the token
[2:01:02] and it is not the chemistry blood
[2:01:06] not the chemistry blood
[2:01:08] by the life in the blood
[2:01:11] yes
[2:01:12] when you drain a man's blood out of him
[2:01:14] the life leaves
[2:01:16] because there is life in the blood
[2:01:21] when one kid killed abel
[2:01:23] yes what did god talk about
[2:01:26] he said
[2:01:27] the voice
[2:01:29] of thy brother's blood cry it unto me
[2:01:34] you think it was
[2:01:36] it was a little out there the
[2:01:38] the liquid no
[2:01:40] there is life
[2:01:42] in the blood
[2:01:44] the talking is the blood of the lord
[2:01:46] jesus that is how i took him
[2:01:50] and it is not the chemistry blood
[2:01:52] but a life in the blood which is god's
[2:01:55] own life that is the holy spirit
[2:01:59] so the holy spirit is our token
[2:02:03] brother brother will tell you to have
[2:02:05] the blood on your hands is judgment
[2:02:09] to have the blood of christ on your
[2:02:11] hands wake that sister up behind you
[2:02:19] to have the blood of christ on your
[2:02:20] hands
[2:02:21] is judgment
[2:02:23] right
[2:02:24] but if you can apply
[2:02:26] the blood
[2:02:28] to your heart
[2:02:30] that is redemption
[2:02:33] it depends on where you apply the blood
[2:02:38] the holy ghost
[2:02:40] is our token
[2:02:44] god in the book of joel
[2:02:47] promised
[2:02:49] that i'll pour my spirit out upon all
[2:02:52] flesh
[2:02:54] and your sons and daughters
[2:02:56] would prophesy and your young men shall
[2:03:00] see visions and your old men
[2:03:03] shall dream dreams
[2:03:05] and in the book of acts
[2:03:07] on the day of pentecost and before then
[2:03:10] the lord jesus told his disciples that
[2:03:12] tarry
[2:03:13] in jerusalem
[2:03:15] do not depart
[2:03:18] do not depart
[2:03:20] why because he knows the importance of
[2:03:23] the holy ghost
[2:03:27] the holy ghost
[2:03:29] the holy ghost to a believer to a child
[2:03:32] of god
[2:03:34] the holy ghost is our strength
[2:03:36] the holy ghost is our victory
[2:03:39] the holy ghost is our healer
[2:03:41] the holy ghost is our peace
[2:03:43] the holy ghost is our joy
[2:03:45] the holy ghost is our life is salvation
[2:03:48] unto us
[2:03:49] the holy ghost is everything you would
[2:03:52] ever desire
[2:03:56] and when the lord jesus himself will
[2:03:58] tell his disciples tarry ye in jerusalem
[2:04:01] do not depart
[2:04:03] taraji until you are endured with power
[2:04:06] from on high it tells you
[2:04:09] the importance
[2:04:11] of the holy ghost baptism in your life
[2:04:15] and brethren says it is the earnest of
[2:04:17] the resurrection
[2:04:19] if you don't have the holy ghost baptism
[2:04:21] forget it
[2:04:24] if you don't have the holy ghost baptism
[2:04:26] you are in trouble
[2:04:27] if you don't have the holy ghost baptism
[2:04:29] you are standing on a sinking scent
[2:04:32] it's just a matter of time
[2:04:35] and the picture will play out and on
[2:04:38] that day of pentecost
[2:04:40] when the holy ghost came down and they
[2:04:43] started speaking in tongues
[2:04:45] what does peter tell the people he said
[2:04:47] repent every one of you
[2:04:50] and we baptized in the name of jesus
[2:04:51] christ for the remission of sins
[2:04:54] he didn't end there
[2:04:56] and he says and you shall have the gift
[2:04:59] of the holy ghost
[2:05:00] for this promise
[2:05:02] is unto you and unto your children's
[2:05:05] children
[2:05:06] and those are far off
[2:05:08] even as many as the lord our god would
[2:05:12] call
[2:05:13] is god who does the calling
[2:05:15] praise be to god it's not you it's god
[2:05:18] who does the calling if god uses you
[2:05:22] you should be you should be humbled
[2:05:24] enough to know that it is god
[2:05:26] that it is not your strength
[2:05:28] no it is not your wisdom
[2:05:30] it is god working through you is god
[2:05:33] doing the calling is god doing the
[2:05:35] pulling
[2:05:36] praise be to god amen
[2:05:38] unto as many as the lord our god would
[2:05:42] call
[2:05:44] and the bible says
[2:05:46] if men if your sons
[2:05:50] would come and tell you daddy mommy i
[2:05:52] want i want i want egg
[2:05:55] and you will not give them a scorpion
[2:05:57] i want bread and you know give them a
[2:05:59] stone
[2:06:00] i want fish and you know give them a
[2:06:02] serpent and the bible says if ye men
[2:06:07] being evil
[2:06:09] know how to go to give good gifts unto
[2:06:12] your children
[2:06:14] how much would your heavenly father
[2:06:16] give the holy ghost to them that asking
[2:06:19] for
[2:06:21] praise be to god
[2:06:24] how much
[2:06:25] and brother branham will tell you
[2:06:27] that god is more willing to give you the
[2:06:30] holy ghost than you are willing to
[2:06:32] receive him amen
[2:06:36] that when you accept christ
[2:06:39] and you are baptized in the name of the
[2:06:40] lord jesus christ for the remission of
[2:06:42] your sins the holy ghost must come in
[2:06:44] the holy ghost comes
[2:06:47] yes
[2:06:50] and if men being evil
[2:06:52] know how to give good gifts to their
[2:06:54] children how much would our heavenly
[2:06:57] father give the holy ghost to them that
[2:06:58] are asking for
[2:07:01] how on earth
[2:07:04] would god leave his throne above and
[2:07:06] become a man come and suffer the things
[2:07:08] he suffered and die and he said no i am
[2:07:11] going to rush in my spirit

[2:07:30] brad braham says
[2:07:33] god is willing
[2:07:35] to give you the holy spirit more than
[2:07:37] you are willing

[2:08:33] i am not going to see a man i am not
[2:08:36] going to hear from a man i am going to
[2:08:38] see god
[2:08:39] a lot of the times
[2:08:40] we come because we are coming to see a
[2:08:42] man or to hear from a man and because of
[2:08:44] that we fail to hear from god before we
[2:08:46] leave his presence
[2:08:51] now when god is talking to you all you
[2:08:54] see is a man
[2:09:00] there is no more time playing church
[2:09:05] one of these days it will all be over
[2:09:11] examine your life
[2:09:13] on a daily basis
[2:09:17] examine your life
[2:09:19] have a relationship with god
[2:09:22] mean business with god get ahold of god
[2:09:26] get ahold of god
[2:09:31] this world is passing by
[2:09:33] and in any case
[2:09:35] if it was not even passing by
[2:09:38] if i am worth ten thousand
[2:09:42] of this world
[2:09:43] what do i want to do
[2:09:46] what portion of it would be
[2:09:50] i don't you know
[2:09:52] what portion of 10 000
[2:09:54] would be
[2:09:55] if i owned the whole of minnesota
[2:10:00] if i own the whole of minnesota
[2:10:02] what portion of it what fraction of it
[2:10:04] what fashion would that be of ten
[2:10:06] thousand
[2:10:08] you can't even begin to put it together
[2:10:16] seek god
[2:10:18] get ahold of god
[2:10:23] know who you are
[2:10:25] that you are a son of god that you are a
[2:10:27] daughter of god
[2:10:29] that you are here to manifest christ
[2:10:34] god has you here for a purpose you are
[2:10:36] just not a number you are not just a
[2:10:39] number
[2:10:40] no god didn't bring you here to make you
[2:10:44] just a number no
[2:10:46] god has you here for your purpose
[2:10:48] and you are here to serve the purpose of
[2:10:50] god
[2:10:53] if you do not know why you are here
[2:10:56] seek the face of god god has an
[2:10:58] assignment for you
[2:11:01] whatever it is i do not know
[2:11:05] but you are not here
[2:11:09] just as a number
[2:11:16] so we have a token
[2:11:19] there's one thing having the token and
[2:11:21] it's another thing applying the token
[2:11:28] and to apply the token is life
[2:11:32] not to apply the token
[2:11:34] is deaf
[2:11:36] as simple as that
[2:11:38] to apply the talking is life
[2:11:42] not to apply the talking is death
[2:11:45] get the holy ghost
[2:11:47] get the holy ghost
[2:11:50] coming to church every sunday and just
[2:11:52] sitting down it's not enough
[2:11:55] it's a good place to be
[2:11:58] but just coming and going is not enough
[2:12:02] get the holy ghost
[2:12:06] get the holy ghost i don't know how many
[2:12:08] times we can emphasize that get the holy
[2:12:11] ghost
[2:12:12] do not let a man be a holy ghost
[2:12:16] do not let a man take the place of god
[2:12:20] in your life
[2:12:23] don't let a man be your holy ghost to
[2:12:26] tell you which church you can go and
[2:12:28] watch you can't go why you fellowship
[2:12:31] and why you can't fellowship
[2:12:34] who you can listen to and who not to
[2:12:36] listen to
[2:12:38] oh
[2:12:39] my brother called me and told me not to
[2:12:42] have anything to do with that church
[2:12:43] that is why i don't go to that church on
[2:12:45] that day when it's time before god tell
[2:12:48] god that and god will say oh well done
[2:12:50] my son come into my rest
[2:12:58] don't let a man be your holy ghost
[2:13:03] to tell you what church to go to and
[2:13:05] where not to go to
[2:13:07] i don't care if this place was once upon
[2:13:09] a time a gas station i don't care
[2:13:12] we have it for a holy sanctuary now when
[2:13:15] we come together god comes down
[2:13:18] praise be to god
[2:13:19] i don't care if it was a butcher house
[2:13:22] i don't care how many cows or how many
[2:13:24] sheep was spotted here i don't care
[2:13:26] about that
[2:13:27] when we come together we have it for a
[2:13:30] holy sanctuary and god comes down
[2:13:33] i don't care if there's a manual pile
[2:13:36] we have it for a holy sanctuary and when
[2:13:39] we come together god comes down
[2:13:42] praise be to god that angel of the
[2:13:44] covenant
[2:13:46] he didn't leave when brother abraham
[2:13:47] left the earth's office
[2:13:49] wherever this message goes that angel of
[2:13:52] the covenant is here god is here
[2:13:55] praise be to god
[2:13:57] why two or three i guarantee my name
[2:13:59] there i am in the amazed god is a
[2:14:01] promise keeper god doesn't lie
[2:14:07] moses
[2:14:09] can you imagine the number of times
[2:14:12] moses was walking
[2:14:13] in the field there in median with with
[2:14:16] his sheep the number of times he walked
[2:14:18] on that same ground
[2:14:20] that same ground where he met god and
[2:14:23] with the sheep jumping ahead button can
[2:14:25] you imagine how many times
[2:14:27] but on that day when god came down what
[2:14:30] did god tell him now remove your shoes
[2:14:33] because you are standing on the holy
[2:14:34] ground
[2:14:35] as when god comes down
[2:14:37] the atmosphere changes
[2:14:40] it's when god comes down there is a
[2:14:42] different ballgame
[2:14:44] there's something happened to joshua
[2:14:46] when he saw that man by the word of
[2:14:48] jericho which is so drawn
[2:14:50] and joshua drew his thought who are you
[2:14:53] are you for us for against us he said i
[2:14:56] am the the captain of the host of the
[2:14:58] eyes of the lord
[2:14:59] and he bowed down and worshiped him
[2:15:02] and he told him take off your shoes
[2:15:05] because you are standing on the holy
[2:15:07] ground praise be to god
[2:15:09] i don't care what it was before
[2:15:12] i don't care
[2:15:13] but when we come together praise be to
[2:15:16] god when god comes down it is a holy
[2:15:20] ground it's a holy ground
[2:15:24] don't take a man's word for it take
[2:15:27] god's word
[2:15:29] take god's word take god's word
[2:15:33] mean business with god until you mean
[2:15:35] business with god god has no time yet
[2:15:42] you don't play hide and seek with god
[2:15:45] like you are playing with your
[2:15:46] colleagues in the bush
[2:15:48] know that you are serving god
[2:15:51] don't play hide and seek with god
[2:15:54] mean business with god
[2:15:56] not a god you are serving
[2:16:01] it's just a matter of time this will be
[2:16:03] over
[2:16:06] as i've said time and again
[2:16:09] it's okay go to school
[2:16:11] but that's not why we are here
[2:16:13] it's okay work
[2:16:14] but that's not why we are here
[2:16:17] business go go ahead but that's not why
[2:16:19] we are here
[2:16:22] we are here for one purpose
[2:16:24] to serve the purpose of god
[2:16:31] to serve the purpose of god
[2:16:36] apply the token
[2:16:39] apply the talking
[2:16:42] and the token
[2:16:43] is the life of god himself the holy
[2:16:47] spirit
[2:16:48] to have the holy spirit
[2:16:51] is life
[2:16:53] not to apply to talking
[2:16:55] you are standing on a dangerous ground
[2:16:59] musicians you can come over
[2:17:04] praise be to god
[2:17:11] apply the token
[2:17:20] [Music]
[2:17:24] see
[2:17:25] the blood
[2:17:26] [Music]
[2:17:32] i see
[2:17:33] the blood
[2:17:35] [Music]
[2:17:37] when i
[2:17:39] [Music]
[2:17:44] um
[2:17:51] [Music]
[2:17:58] see the blood
[2:18:02] when i
[2:18:06] see the blood
[2:18:27] christ
[2:18:28] the redeemer
[2:18:30] died on the cross
[2:18:34] died for this
[2:18:39] [Music]
[2:19:25] as jesus will save
[2:19:29] all he has
[2:19:33] [Music]
[2:19:45] survived
[2:19:51] [Music]
[2:20:14] about i want us to go before the lord
[2:20:17] just talk to god
[2:20:19] because the bible has made it clear that
[2:20:22] the word of god will not go out and come
[2:20:24] back void
[2:20:25] and the bible says that the word of god
[2:20:27] is profitable for doctrine for reproof
[2:20:30] for correction and instruction in all
[2:20:32] righteousness
[2:20:34] there is a reason why oh god the word of
[2:20:37] god has come to us the way it did today
[2:20:39] and i want you to set your heart
[2:20:42] set your heart
[2:20:44] if christ should come today are you
[2:20:46] ready
[2:20:49] and if you are not ready what is your
[2:20:51] excuse
[2:20:52] what is holding you back today
[2:20:55] what is holding you back
[2:20:58] after all the years of sermons
[2:21:02] after all the years of service
[2:21:05] if you are still not yet ready what is
[2:21:07] holding you back
[2:21:10] it is not for me to answer
[2:21:12] set your heart
[2:21:14] search your life
[2:21:15] and i want you to talk to god
[2:21:19] you have heard the word of god
[2:21:21] they're talking
[2:21:23] and we are told to apply the talk in his
[2:21:25] life not to apply the token step
[2:21:29] and the token is none other than the
[2:21:31] life of god himself in you the holy
[2:21:34] ghost
[2:21:35] and we need the holy ghost
[2:21:38] we need him
[2:21:41] it's a must you ought to have the holy
[2:21:43] ghost
[2:21:45] there are no two ways about it
[2:21:47] i want us to talk to god this morning
[2:21:49] pray talk to god
[2:21:51] seek his face
[2:21:52] concerning your life and what you have
[2:21:54] heard today shall we pray
[2:21:58] our lord and our savior jesus

[2:23:47] course

[2:23:52] authority in our lives our sons and
[2:23:54] daughters of the most high god

[2:23:59] that the holy ghost is our token
[2:24:01] and to apply the token
[2:24:04] is life
[2:24:05] not to apply the token is death
[2:24:08] father we have no reason not to apply
