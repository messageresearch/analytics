TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] brought a lamb. He laid his hand upon the lamb. His throat was cut because he sinned. And this lamb died for his sin. Now, the reason he went out, says Hebrews, with the same desire that he had coming, if he committed adultery, he goes back out with the same desire. If he could kill, he goes back out the same desire. hatred. When that blood cell or the lamb was broke, that blood cell in the lamb was an animal's life. It could not come back and dwell in a human life because the animal life has no soul. But the human life has a soul. See, animal don't have a soul. It don't know. You don't have to wear clothes and cover up it snakeness and say bad words and you know what I mean. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; See, they they don't know it. They fell because they're under us. The human beings are above the Amalite because they're a god of the Amalite. That's right. What was in the beginning called Adam named him and had power over Genesis 1:26. He had dominion over all the earth. He was he was made in the image of God and was made to be a lesser God. Jesus said so. Said not your law say that you're gods and if they call them gods who the word of God came to you which was prophet, how do you condemn me when I say the son of God? See there you are now. Now in this the father, son, and holy ghost. Now after he dwelt in the pillar of fire, then came down and made himself a body, brought himself down a tent of human flesh and dwelled him among us. God brought 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy, Paul speaking. Great is the mystery of godliness, for God was manifested in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. creator became savior and a great song that booth clever wrote the great creator became my savior and all god's fullness dwelt in him see now notice father Daniel was the father of way above us couldn't even get around where he was at then he became son and we could touch him feel him is a man and then he gave his life that blood cell was broken by a cruel sinful Roman spear when it pierced his heart and really a broken heart killed him. His water and blood separate. Grief broke the cell of grief because of the sin of the human race. He used to sing a little song. Oh, what precious love that father had for Adam's fallen race. Gave his only son to suffer and redeem us by his grace. Now there that blood cell was broke. Now when we lay our hands by faith upon that trembling lamb of God, feel his flesh quivering and shaking for us and our hands become bathed with his blood in our soul. The life that was in him wasn't just a mere man. Neither was it an animal. It was God. So that life comes back up on the sanctified one and becomes a son or a daughter, an offspring of God. See the life of God. And we are sons and daughters of God through the breaking of that blood cell, Jesus Christ. Now what is then? God is back in his people fellowshipping like he did in the garden of Eden. See there you are sons and daughter. Isn't it beautiful? Beautiful God. Now, now we're going to finish the baptism. Now, let's go. Now, from that time, now the next time baptism spoke of, Philip went down and preached to the Samaritan. Acts 8, I believe it is. Yeah, Acts 87. Stevens the stone. I think it's Acts 8 that Philip went out and preached to the Samaritans and they had all baptized every one of them in the name of Jesus Christ. But the Holy Ghost had fell on none of them yet. Peter had the key. &gt;&gt; He has unlocked. &gt;&gt; He has unlocked to that generation. Then when he goes down and the Holy Ghost has fallen on them yet they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Peter went out him and John and laid Peter laid hands up on them and they received the Holy Ghost. Now then while Peter was on the housetop one time and Simon the tanner, he saw a vision because carne it's the gentile. There's the Jew Samaritan now the Gentile. And Peter was on the housetop taking a little nap before dinner while he was fixing dinner. And he seen a sheep being lowered down. All kinds of unclean creeping animals from the earth is on it. And then when he did that, he heard a voice saying, "Rise, Peter, slay and eat." He said, "Nothing's ever come in my mouth unclean." Said, "Don't you call unclean what I call or come and unclean what I'll call clean." See, as a Gentile. And then when he come out of the vision, there was two men standing at the gate calling for him to go up and he tell spirit told him rise and go. Don't think about nothing. Just go on with them. Went to the house of Cornelius. He gathered up. Cornelius was a centurion. He called all his band together and they were all in there and Peter was explaining to him what had happened and Cornelius told him that he had saw an angel that told him to go down and ask for one Simon as follow Simon the Tanner's house. And while Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word. And Peter said, "Can we forbid water?" Seeing that they have received the Holy Ghost like we did. And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Now, Acts 19, that's Acts 10:49 there, sister. You're putting it down. Acts 10:49. All right. 10:47 on down to the end of the chapter. Read it. And then when they come now to Acts uh uh Acts 19 baptism mentioned again Paul now now that makes everybody now the only time baptism is ever rendered was John the Baptist first they were baptized over there they now but they wasn't baptizing in the name of Jesus because they didn't know who he was yet. See now, but now when Jesus said in Matthew 28:19, "Baptize the name of the father, son, holy ghost," and gave that expression to the man he gave the keys to that had the revelation of what it was all about revealed from heaven. That's what you're getting right now. The revelation from heaven just straighten it out. It'll hit the target if you just stay right with it. It's zeroed already. It hit land. Peter had a vision and zero it. This does it, too. Brings it right back in. The gun shooting where it's supposed to shoot now. See? Yes. Now then Paul was a was the apostle to the Gentiles. Is that right? He was a gentile. Of course God sent him to the Gentiles. Now now you're everybody then was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Everyone the Jews were they baptized in Jesus name. Acts 2 38. &gt;&gt; Samaritans Acts 8 were they baptized in Jesus name? &gt;&gt; All right. Gentiles at Acts 10:49 they baptized in Jesus name wasn't. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, now there's some more people running around there that isn't baptized in Jesus name, yet they've been baptized. I guess it'll be all right then. So, just let them alone because they've been baptized. What difference does it make? Baptized. But John say we're going to see. We going to see whether this is essential or not. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Acts 19. Paul hasn't passed through the upper coast of Ephesus. He finds certain disciples. Now there was a young Baptist preacher up there and um his name was Apollo which was Apollos rather and uh he was a brilliant man. Acts the 19th chapter. And he was uh he was a brilliant man. And he was u he was proven by the Bible like a real Baptist &gt;&gt; that Jesus was the Christ by the Bible. And they had a revival up there, a great revival. And Paul had been put in jail for casting out his devil out of a fortune teller. And so him and Silas and one night they got to praying in there and singing him and the Lord come out, shut the jail down. So then uh after he had got delivered went out and took the centurion and baptized him and his wife as Paul's cousin of course is baptized in Jesus name and then wanted to talk him and his uh family out and baptize them and then Paul went on his way and he went over to Aquilla and Priscilla which were tent makers friends of his converts to Christ and they had been tending this revival up here for these Baptists 18th chapter before you'd read that just one chapter before. Uh so then so then Paul passed through the upper coast of Ephesus. He finds certain disciples. They were disciples. They were Baptists. Fine preacher and everything proven under the Bible Jesus is the Christ. And he said unto them, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believe?" Ah, you trinitarian brother and sister, you like to lay that into the Baptist. But I wonder if we can lay something back again. You like to say, "Ah, you Baptist. How about you said you received the Holy Ghost when you believed? Paul said, "Have you received it since you believe?" And these people were honest. They said, "We know there'll be one any Holy Ghost." Now, if it don't make any difference after that baptism, water baptism don't make any difference. Why did this apostle ask this question? So, then to what were you baptized? Oh, they might have said this. Oh, we've been baptized. They said, "We've been baptized unto John and we're very well satisfied with it." The same man baptized Jesus Christ. Same old water. I guess that you you baptized John right the same old water Jesus baptiz. You think it's pretty good, wouldn't you? &gt;&gt; But remember the keys is locked in heaven. Peter did on the Yes, sir. Yes, sir. See, it's a mystery. It's hidden. Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. Here's a revelation that only can come through this revelation. See, you see Paul said, "But that won't work anymore." Have you received the Holy Ghost? Since you believe it, said we don't. It'll be one of the Holy Ghost said, "To what was your baptizer?" Otherwise, how was you baptized? They said, "We've already been baptized." Oh, yes, sir. Yes, that's your Apostle Paul. We've been baptized. We baptized. But John the Baptist, right? There's the same old water Jesus Christ is baptized. If he was good enough for Jesus to baptize her, boy, I'm telling you, he's good enough for me. Hallelujah. If they done that, they'd have never got it. &gt;&gt; But Paul said, "Have you received it since you believed?" Said, "We know not where there be any." Oh, go said, "Then what was you baptized?" They said, "Unto John." He said, "John only baptized unto repentance, saying they was to believe on him that was to come, that is on Jesus Christ." And when they heard this, they were rebaptized in the name of Jesus Christ. That brings this group over this group. And they laid their hands up on him and he spoke in tongues and prophesied. I'll tell that every scripture in the Bible, every person in the Bible was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. I'll take any man, any historian to this task. If you can show me one speck of scripture where anybody was ever baptized in the Bible, New Church, of course, he wasn't baptized in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament where any persons is ever baptized in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost, one place, if that was ever called over him, father, Son, and Holy Ghost, then I'll compromise. And if you and I'll show you if you can show me one text of scripture where anybody was ever baptized in the name of father, son, and holy ghost or one speck of history where anyone was ever baptized and to the ordaining or the studying and order the Catholic Church and AD 600 &gt;&gt; 325 it is AD 325 325 years after the apostles everybody continued baptizing in the name of the father, son, holy ghost in the name of Jesus Christ until 3:25 and then they made the organization and in the organization which the Catholic Church is a mother of all organizations. God never did organize a church but in there they substituted the name of father son holy ghost but calls the trinitarians and then they had a great group that went rank and trinitarian and a great group that went rank and unarian which both groups is wrong. See, but no and any person that's baptized using those titles of father, son, holy ghost ignorantly are admitting that they are Catholics and denying what the Bible says. Now, my brethren, and you to listen to this tape, I'm I I w that through ignorance you do this. Don't just throw this away, these women presenting this to you, but you owe it to yourself to sit down and study it and find out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're not, if if you're a child of God, surely you'll give it that much consideration. The word of the Lord came to the prophets in the old days. The reason they called them prophets because they had the interpretation of the divine word because they were divinely sent and the signs and wonders that follow them prove that they were. God has said in his scripture, if there be a prophet among you, and if he says things and it's not right, don't come to pass, then don't fear him. But if it does come to pass, then you hear, for I am with him. And the very word prophet means a divine interpreter of the divine word. The signs and wonders that ma makes the word manifest is a sign that it came. Now we believe that the gift of prophecy that ties the words together are saying now not long ago and maybe the same man may listen to this tape someday that I at this taking place. It was brother sism of the oneness. Now you you many of you people listening this would say brother Brandham is a oneness. I am not. I think you're both wrong. Both oneness and trinity. Not to be different but it's always a middle of the road like Isaiah said. Isaiah 35 said there shall be a highway. And you Nazarene brothers and so forth you say the grand old highway of holiness. I beg your pardon. It doesn't say the highway of holiness. that there shall be a highway and and is a conjunction and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness, not the highway of holiness. The way is in the middle of the road. Each side is where the offs went to on one side and trinitarian went on the other side. But the true message lays in the center of the road. Now watch here if you'll understand. Now I'm laying three things out. Now, I'm taking this to be what Matthew said and to show you that both men said the same thing. But one the trinitarian people through I hate to say this and don't want to say it, but I don't want to say through ignorance as the Bible said, but I mean that through misinterpretation. You can't make it run right, brethren. You'll never make it run right. It can't till you come back to the revelation and then the whole scripture runs right. Now look here my sisters and you brethren who are present. Matthew said father son holy ghost. Now if you'll go get the emphatic diagnost of the Greek interpretation original Greek interpretation from the Vatican happens to be that I have one. uh it's out of print now I think or any Greek uh uh translation the right translation to Acts 238 Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the King James version said in the name of Jesus Christ but in the emphatic dig it says in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now when you want this brethren just baptize in the name of Jesus There just many Jesus's but there's only He was born Christ the son of God he that's his name that's what he is Christ means the anointed one messiah Christ now Jesus 8 days later he was given the name Jesus when he was circumcised and he is our Lord so he is our Lord Jesus Christ. That's what he is. Now, so that you'll see that Peter had the revelation I'm trying to tell you. Now, look at these these boxes on this side. Father, Son, Holy Ghost. That's what Matthew said. 10 days later, Peter said, "Lord Jesus Christ." Now see if these three titles isn't three names uh or the one name of the three titles. Now look, Matthew said father. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But Peter said Lord. Now David said the Lord said unto my Lord. Now they both said the same thing there, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Lord God. &gt;&gt; Thy Lord Lord thy God is one. God is true. All right. Now, Peter said in the name of the Lord and Matthew said a title to that Lord which is father. Lord's what he is. All right. Matthew said son. Who is the son? Jesus said Peter. That right? All right. Now, and Matthew said Holy Ghost. Peter said Christ, which is the Holy Ghost, the logos that went out of God. &gt;&gt; See, father, son, holy ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, exactly. The Lord Jesus Christ. So, them are titles and not There you are. Paul, &gt;&gt; I wish we had longer going to it, but it's getting late. Can we uh pray just a moment? &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father, thou does know that we're not trying to try to say something here to confuse anyone. Father God, we're trying to take confusion out of their mind. And no doubt by what they'll be lovely fine Christian brothers, ministers, trinitarian believers that will hear this. Our sisters may play it to their pastors. And I pray, Father, that that you won't let my brother think that I'm trying to act like a knowit all or something. [Applause] But Lord, I am grateful that that you give us the revelation of the word. And I've tried to be like a a Christian brother to them. Never mention it amongst the people. Just go ahead because Lord, I believe they are your children. But they they find these seemingly contradictions in the Bible and they've made a great issue out of it. The assemblies would not associate with the oneness. The oneness was called which we know now and here in this meeting fellowshipping with some of those brethren and we do in every meeting. But Lord, we know they're all your children. But they made a great issue and pulled away and cut off. The assemblies will have nothing to do with them. And they won't have nothing to do with the assemblies, the churches of God and so forth. And each one in doing so, Father, I realize they draw boundary lines and become stuck up and organized. And what did you do with both organizations? Laid them up on the shelf and they're both dying and practically dead. Let honest-hearted people see. Lord, I cannot open their eyes. You're the only one can do that. I present your truth by a revelation of Jesus Christ, which ties the words together, God's word, and make it the true word. I pray that they'll not misunderstand, but will love you and serve you all the days of their life and walk in the light. Grant it, Lord. I pray for these women. Now, I pray that everyone that sees this will not cause them to be confused, but will cause them to be hungered and thirsting for more of God's revelations. Grant it, Father. I commit this to you now. You do with it whatever seems good in your hand in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [Music] Hey. Hey. Hey. [Music]
