[45:16] your hands Lord and ask that you bless
[45:19] them too we love you and we appreciate
[45:21] you father in Jesus name we pray amen
[45:26] amen
[45:29] the Lord bless you you may have your
[45:31] seat on U Sunday we had we had a uh
[45:35] communion service and in the morning we
[45:38] spoke a little bit about communion and
[45:41] Tiding because we were looking there in
[45:43] Genesis chapter 15 and uh and the Bible
[45:46] says after these things and the Lord
[45:48] appeared unto Abraham in a vision saying
[45:52] I'm your your shed and your exceeding
[45:55] and great reward
[45:57] praise the Lord and uh uh so we went
[46:01] back to see what happened before God
[46:03] visited Abraham there way and we
[46:06] realized that it was when Abraham had
[46:08] just returned back from uh uh the the
[46:12] the slaughtered of the king he just came
[46:14] back from redeeming his brother lot and
[46:19] uh uh
[46:20] so and we we were just uh uh trying to
[46:25] uh uh appre appreciate that as we talk
[46:28] about the ministry of reconciliation we
[46:30] also talk about uh Redemption you know
[46:34] Abraham was involved in Redemption and
[46:36] that will bring God on the sin every
[46:39] time praise the Lord amen it will bring
[46:42] God on the SC every time because there
[46:45] that's uh that's that's God's work there
[46:49] is only one mediator between man and God
[46:52] that's the man Christ Jesus amen praise
[46:55] the Lord so whenever you step to do that
[46:57] work God will come he will come he will
[46:59] step in your body you know whenever your
[47:03] your your your purpose your approach is
[47:06] to reconcile and uh sometimes we don't
[47:09] go about it the right way but you know
[47:11] God knowing the intention of our heart
[47:14] will give us Grace amen so tonight we
[47:17] want to we want to go in that same
[47:19] direction tonight but what I want for us
[47:21] to look at is that we want to look at
[47:23] Communion we want to look at communion
[47:26] with him
[47:27] praise the Lord we'll go back a little
[47:29] bit to what we talk about on on on
[47:32] Sunday uh uh and and and bring uh you
[47:35] know and and just be able to trust the
[47:38] Lord that it will uh he will help us to
[47:40] bring it out a little more clearer than
[47:42] it was because when you when you look at
[47:46] what happened in Genesis chapter 15
[47:49] praise the Lord if if you read many
[47:53] scholars
[47:54] believe that uh you know that uh meic or
[47:59] meic whichever way uh we can rightly
[48:02] pronounce it many scholars believe that
[48:06] he was a
[48:07] priest okay they somehow believe some of
[48:10] them believe that you know well it was a
[48:13] priest at that time that was in that
[48:15] area and they have and and some you know
[48:17] speak about you know the prefigure of
[48:20] Jesus Christ and and all of that but
[48:23] this is what I want for us to watch as
[48:26] we as we as we look into into that
[48:29] subject tonight because what we want to
[48:32] talk about we want to talk about
[48:34] communing with God how we can commune
[48:36] with God like we said on Sunday uh there
[48:39] is a spiritual communion amen but the
[48:42] spiritual communion do not uh uh uh stop
[48:47] us from uh from participating in the
[48:50] ordinance that was given to the church
[48:53] whatever we did on Sunday we were
[48:55] fulfilling the scripture
[48:57] when Jesus says as often as you do this
[49:00] you do this in remembrance of me amen so
[49:03] we were remembering the Lord as we as we
[49:06] approach the Lord table on Sunday but as
[49:11] we will see tonight we trust that the
[49:13] Lord will give us Grace amen he will
[49:15] give us Grace and we will be able to
[49:18] look into this as we go along but
[49:20] brother BR here in the message door to
[49:22] the heart he will take that scripture we
[49:25] read in Revelation chap 3 20 he will
[49:27] says I stand and knock at the door and
[49:31] if any man will
[49:35] open God doesn't pull your heart open he
[49:39] just knock and you have to open up
[49:44] praise the Lord amen he just knocked and
[49:48] you have to open it up I stand and KN
[49:52] and if any man will hear my voice and
[49:55] open I will will come in and soup with
[49:58] him and he with me now
[50:01] soing souping in the Old Testament all
[50:05] in their Oriental days of the Lord visit
[50:09] on Earth was
[50:12] communing praise the Lord amen so you
[50:15] see right here uh uh in uh in in in uh
[50:20] laition age God is is going to restore
[50:24] true communion to the church this is the
[50:27] only age that was that was invited
[50:30] today amen this is the only age that God
[50:34] says if you open unto me I will come
[50:37] into you and commune with you praise the
[50:41] Lord so truth communion be uh beside
[50:45] what catholism has introduced to the
[50:48] church All Through the Ages and and all
[50:51] what the reformers has done and all what
[50:54] the restoration of the gift has done God
[50:57] was going to have a people where he
[50:59] would bring truth communion a people
[51:03] that will respect the La Table and the
[51:06] people that will not only stop at the
[51:08] Lost table but they will have communion
[51:10] with God every day amen amen amen praise
[51:14] the
[51:15] Lord amen so so he says here and uh I
[51:20] will come in and have communion with him
[51:24] sit down and talk things over right
[51:28] praise the Lord if you are not talking
[51:31] things over with the Lord you're not
[51:33] having communion
[51:36] righten praise the Lord amen amen amen
[51:40] just a little talk with
[51:43] Jesus tell him all about my trouble and
[51:47] also would let he tell you also how he
[51:50] feels about your trouble amen are we
[51:53] together
[51:57] come in and we'll have communion with
[52:00] him sit down and talk things over don't
[52:03] you want him to do that with you praise
[52:07] the Lord do you really want the Lord
[52:10] come in and talk things over with you
[52:14] not only taking what the preacher says
[52:16] on now but what the Holy Ghost is saying
[52:19] speaking to your heart recognizing the
[52:22] small stay verse when he speaks to you
[52:25] amen that's truth
[52:28] communion praise the
[52:30] Lord if you
[52:33] feel a stify life that brings you to the
[52:36] table to partake of the ordinance and
[52:39] you have not entered in this
[52:41] relationship with God you're not having
[52:44] truth communion right you are observing
[52:47] an
[52:49] ordinance but this is where God want us
[52:51] to be amen
[52:54] amen praise the Lord amen we will not
[52:57] forsake the ordinance as long Jesus said
[53:01] we must do it as often as we can he will
[53:04] not have it with us anymore until in in
[53:08] in the in in the Kingdom at at the
[53:10] Lord's
[53:11] Supper that's his promise we will not do
[53:14] away with it but where we want to go we
[53:17] want to come up higher amen amen amen we
[53:21] want the the the the the the ordinance
[53:26] to prepare us to enter into a communion
[53:30] with God am that's what we want to talk
[53:33] about
[53:35] tonight
[53:36] amen that's what we want to talk about
[53:40] tonight and uh uh let's let's go go on
[53:43] yet a little bit and communion brother
[53:46] bam says what does the word communion
[53:49] means commun means to
[53:53] talk to have communion re really means
[53:57] to have
[53:59] Fellowship talk with each
[54:02] other not in church now you talking with
[54:05] each other in church when we come here
[54:08] we talk to him and he talk back to us
[54:12] righten I'll read it down to you right
[54:14] now brother say we're not even having
[54:16] communion if you just listening to me
[54:18] and you are not saying anything back he
[54:21] says that's not
[54:22] communion amen
[54:27] praise the
[54:29] Lord that's the reason why sometimes the
[54:31] preacher preach and and and and even his
[54:34] own message structs him sometime God
[54:37] speaks to him because it is God that is
[54:39] doing the speaking
[54:41] amen
[54:43] amen so he go ahead he says communion
[54:46] really means to have Fellowship to talk
[54:49] with each other if you talk on the phone
[54:52] with
[54:53] someone you carry a conversation there
[54:57] you are communing one with another if it
[55:01] is not only you doing the
[55:04] talking if you are allowing the the
[55:06] other person on the other side to
[55:09] talk then you are communing if you are
[55:12] the one that is just doing the talking
[55:14] then you are either instructing or
[55:16] teaching or directing but you're not
[55:19] communing praise the Lord allow them to
[55:22] be able to talk back to you too praise
[55:25] the Lord
[55:27] see he says here talk on the phone to
[55:30] someone you carry the conversation there
[55:32] you are communing one with another and
[55:35] if we should come aside and stand back
[55:38] and stand in the back of the building an
[55:40] individual with the pastor the
[55:43] individual and the pastor or any two
[55:45] people they are communing one one with
[55:48] the other now you do not commute By
[55:53] Radio because you listen and you can't
[55:56] talk
[55:57] back if you don't agree with what they
[56:00] say you can't share your
[56:02] opinion praise the Lord amen amen if you
[56:06] watch the news on on on television or on
[56:09] your phone or whatever you are not
[56:13] communing praise the Lord you are not
[56:18] communing you are not
[56:20] fellowshipping if you are just watching
[56:22] something on your phone you are not
[56:24] fellowshipping
[56:27] because you're not contributing you just
[56:30] receiving are we
[56:32] together are we stay in the thir process
[56:35] now it's different I mean if you are if
[56:37] you
[56:39] are listening to an AUD your Bible you
[56:42] are listening to the word of God then
[56:45] definitely uh if the word speaks to you
[56:48] you can say yes Lord he say Lord thank
[56:51] you for speaking to me through what I've
[56:53] just read amen
[56:56] praise the
[56:58] Lord but I mean if you are on YouTube
[57:01] and Facebook I don't know how you can
[57:03] commute oh yeah maybe you can text back
[57:04] and share your opinion but let me get
[57:07] out of
[57:08] there praise the Lord let me get out of
[57:12] there are we together amen amen but you
[57:15] will see what I'm going tonight and then
[57:19] you he
[57:22] say now you do not commute By Radio
[57:26] because you cannot talk back or
[57:29] television you you can by by telephone
[57:33] because you are communing one to the
[57:36] other
[57:38] just uh isn't one side is it should not
[57:41] just be one side you should be able to
[57:44] Fellowship I cannot commute with you now
[57:47] because you do not talk back so brother
[57:51] B behind the pullit he says I can't
[57:52] commun with
[57:54] you I I'm not communing with you but we
[57:57] are communing with the Lord amen amen
[58:01] amen amen we are communing with him
[58:04] because we are fellowshipping around the
[58:08] word amen he says I cannot commune with
[58:12] you now because you do not talk back so
[58:15] therefore it would it will not be coming
[58:18] to hear a minister deliver his message
[58:21] that's not communing that will not be
[58:24] coming together to to to uh to communion
[58:28] communion will not be there if you come
[58:32] just to commune with the minister you
[58:34] they call him to the side or an
[58:37] individual and you commun with him or
[58:40] she but to what we come into
[58:45] communion is for each of us as
[58:49] individuals to commun with Christ so
[58:53] while the word is being preached all the
[58:56] song is being sung We Are communing with
[58:59] him because we are relating to the word
[59:02] amen and we are telling him thank you
[59:05] praise the
[59:07] Lord or we are saying Lord we need your
[59:10] help oh God have mercy on us oh Lord
[59:13] thank you blessed be the name of the
[59:15] Lord amen hallelujah that's why when we
[59:18] say let's give the Lord a hand of praise
[59:20] it must not be a hard thing to do
[59:22] because he's the one you're not clapping
[59:23] for me we are clapping for him let's
[59:26] give the Lord a hand of
[59:27] Praise
[59:34] amen praise the
[59:37] Lord
[59:40] amen now listen to this now as we as we
[59:43] want to just rub this thing down in
[59:45] before we get to what we want to talk
[59:46] about tonight he
[59:49] says now there is where many times that
[59:53] we make our greatest mistake is we we do
[59:57] all the talking and don't wait and give
[1:00:01] him a chance to answer
[1:00:05] back we go sometimes say Lord I who that
[1:00:09] you do so so so so so so so amen and get
[1:00:13] up and leave now that's really isn't
[1:00:18] that really is in
[1:00:20] communion there's goinging and asking
[1:00:23] for
[1:00:24] favor praise the Lord
[1:00:26] and many times and and that's that's the
[1:00:28] way our prayer life
[1:00:30] is we just get on our knees and and we
[1:00:33] just pray we cry we just speak to the
[1:00:35] Lord and we we just say Lord help me
[1:00:37] help me and we just we get you know
[1:00:40] tired and we says Lord thank you you
[1:00:42] know amen amen but we don't wait for him
[1:00:45] to speak back to
[1:00:48] us praise the Lord amen
[1:00:53] am I mean it would just be entering the
[1:00:56] room and just venting and slapping the
[1:00:58] door and getting back
[1:01:01] out I really don't think that's what we
[1:01:04] do but what are we talking about we need
[1:01:07] to come up a little higher amen amen in
[1:01:10] our relationship because the god that we
[1:01:12] have we are worshiping he's not a statue
[1:01:15] he's a living God God have feelings the
[1:01:19] Bible say he's touched by the feelings
[1:01:21] of our infs
[1:01:26] yes praise the Lord and let me tell you
[1:01:29] the truth about the M de is that you
[1:01:31] have to grow in this right it's not
[1:01:35] something that you can just you can just
[1:01:37] automatically do why because you get
[1:01:40] down on your knees before you even start
[1:01:42] praying the devil is blasting your mind
[1:01:44] with everything you have gone through
[1:01:46] something about yesterday about the
[1:01:48] thing you have to do tomorrow and your
[1:01:50] mind is just going wow wow wow wow wow
[1:01:52] wow you can't even grab your thought you
[1:01:55] just saying oh Lord Jesus I thank you
[1:01:57] Father and your mind just ging I mean
[1:02:02] sometimes if you don't know how to
[1:02:04] persist and you don't know how to stay
[1:02:06] and break through you get frustrated and
[1:02:09] you just get off your
[1:02:10] knees and you don't even know if you
[1:02:13] have
[1:02:14] prayed because your mind is just so work
[1:02:19] out praise the Lord sometimes you get a
[1:02:23] little breakthrough then you you you you
[1:02:25] feel the Lord helping you your mind is
[1:02:27] focused and you are putting things
[1:02:28] before the Lord you are speaking to God
[1:02:31] and and you are feeling good so good
[1:02:33] about
[1:02:34] it but then after you have said give him
[1:02:37] a chance also for the say so now
[1:02:41] sometimes that's where the battle is
[1:02:44] because the moment you stop you stop
[1:02:46] speaking to the Lord and you want to
[1:02:48] just keep your mind on him then pretty
[1:02:50] soon your mind start going again you
[1:02:52] know the Devil he's the he's he's the
[1:02:55] prince of the power of the
[1:02:57] air praise the Lord I tell you the the
[1:03:00] Lord really really blessed me with a
[1:03:02] wonderful thought today I was praying
[1:03:04] and uh uh uh you know I was just uh uh I
[1:03:08] was I was just committing some things in
[1:03:10] the hands of the Lord and I don't know
[1:03:11] maybe it was the the the this thought
[1:03:14] that was on my mind or whatever it is
[1:03:16] but I
[1:03:17] remember my mind went down to the place
[1:03:20] where uh uh uh uh uh uh Paul said in in
[1:03:26] in Ephesian that Satan is the is the
[1:03:29] prince of the power of the air amen then
[1:03:32] you you you will see that Paul could say
[1:03:35] that because over in
[1:03:38] Daniel the Bible says that Daniel was
[1:03:41] praying and the devil uh uh with stod
[1:03:45] his prayer or the devil was was blocking
[1:03:48] his answer and the the Prince of Persia
[1:03:51] now brother Bram said every city has a
[1:03:54] spirit right now that's that's the
[1:03:56] thought that my mind was dwelling in
[1:03:59] every Spirit has a you know has a spirit
[1:04:02] as we go about to work and we go about
[1:04:04] to shopping we move about you know what
[1:04:07] I mean the the the the the things we see
[1:04:09] the the noises we hear all of those
[1:04:12] things are spirits that are breathe in
[1:04:14] the end because just just remind
[1:04:16] yourself when you are praying the things
[1:04:19] that are coming to your mind they are
[1:04:20] not just made your mind is not making it
[1:04:22] up there was something you hear there
[1:04:24] was something you see you see so all of
[1:04:26] those Spirit come to Cloud your
[1:04:30] Heavens it comes to Cloud your mind
[1:04:33] that's right and sometimes you want to
[1:04:35] take your mind through it but you see
[1:04:37] Daniel Daniel didn't give up right
[1:04:41] praise the Lord he persisted he still
[1:04:44] there a little
[1:04:46] bit that's right and the angel said from
[1:04:50] the first day when you got down on your
[1:04:53] knees because God said before you even
[1:04:56] speak our
[1:04:58] answer your answer was on the
[1:05:01] way but the Springs of pressure the
[1:05:05] spirit of the aiel the spirit of the
[1:05:08] things you are dealing
[1:05:10] with amen amen praise the
[1:05:14] Lord amen amen what is it trying to do
[1:05:18] it is just casting doubt is casting
[1:05:21] discouragement
[1:05:24] yes and you see if we are not trained on
[1:05:28] how to wait on the
[1:05:31] Lord and how to direct our touch you
[1:05:35] will not receive an audible voice and
[1:05:37] and I don't mean that God can speak to
[1:05:39] you
[1:05:40] audibly but if you are not trained even
[1:05:43] if God speak you will not you will not
[1:05:45] identify it because God spoke to Samuel
[1:05:48] he could not identify he needed to be
[1:05:51] taught to recognize the voice of God
[1:05:54] right are we
[1:05:57] together praise the
[1:06:00] Lord now so let me let me just let me
[1:06:02] just uh uh uh uh give you some some keys
[1:06:09] here praise the
[1:06:11] Lord
[1:06:19] amen well what what I do I mean over the
[1:06:23] time uh I mean I I I read really
[1:06:26] struggle in my mind as a Young
[1:06:29] Man praise the Lord and I know that uh
[1:06:33] years back I would prayed and and I
[1:06:36] would just cry to God just just to free
[1:06:39] my mind I would just say Lord I just I
[1:06:42] just want a minute where my mind would
[1:06:43] just be stay on
[1:06:47] you praise the
[1:06:49] Lord and sometimes you you you you put
[1:06:53] your mind on the Lord and you start you
[1:06:55] start to sing a song and you you try to
[1:06:58] keep your mind on the Lord and and
[1:07:00] before you realize again your thought
[1:07:02] starts trading away from you praise the
[1:07:06] Lord sometimes it's the things that we
[1:07:08] feed our mind
[1:07:10] with and all of those things now become
[1:07:13] Spirits they become spiritual battle you
[1:07:17] realize that if you if you are if if if
[1:07:20] your if your mind is is on the word you
[1:07:22] are you are you are listening to the
[1:07:25] word or reading something to the word
[1:07:27] and your mind something catch your mind
[1:07:29] you realize that thing will be playing
[1:07:31] on your
[1:07:33] mind praise the Lord so for many times I
[1:07:36] I was struggled and I just I just
[1:07:38] couldn't get my mind
[1:07:41] still so the Lord help
[1:07:44] me and every time when I get through
[1:07:47] praying I'll take the
[1:07:49] Bible I'll start to
[1:07:52] read praise the Lord amen I'll start to
[1:07:55] read now we have audio
[1:07:58] Bible sometimes I would just play an
[1:08:01] audio Bible or I just play the message
[1:08:05] you know and and as as I'm trying to to
[1:08:09] to to meditate or listening to what I'm
[1:08:14] hearing sometime God speaks to me
[1:08:17] through those
[1:08:19] things praise the Lord
[1:08:22] amen sometime I pick up something and I
[1:08:24] say I know this is the
[1:08:27] Lord praise the
[1:08:31] Lord so you see just like how Samuel was
[1:08:35] trained to identify the voice of God we
[1:08:38] have we have to be
[1:08:41] trained praise the Lord
[1:08:44] amen you have to train your mind if you
[1:08:47] can't get your mind still I mean if you
[1:08:49] if you can if if you are not uh can't
[1:08:52] train your mind to memorize Bible verses
[1:08:55] you you know if you can train your mind
[1:08:56] to memorize Bible verses think about the
[1:08:59] Bible verse you want to to to memorize
[1:09:02] and let it come back to you I try to
[1:09:04] think what did I read or what was my
[1:09:06] memory verse
[1:09:08] today and the moment your attention is
[1:09:12] there that's that's what God
[1:09:14] wants the moment your attention is there
[1:09:17] he knows that my child is trying to take
[1:09:21] a little step then he comes around
[1:09:24] praise the Lord
[1:09:26] then he brings the thing that you were
[1:09:27] thinking about he just flooded to your
[1:09:29] mind then you get so excited oh my I
[1:09:32] never thought about
[1:09:35] this it it is now you creating the
[1:09:38] thought praise the Lord
[1:09:43] amen because what we want to do we want
[1:09:46] to commune with
[1:09:47] him we don't just want to bust God
[1:09:50] around Lord I want this Lord help me
[1:09:53] this Lord I want this Lord help me this
[1:09:55] then you just SL no we want to commune
[1:09:57] with him we want to be able to have a
[1:10:00] time and just appreciate
[1:10:02] him and just thank him and just think
[1:10:06] about his
[1:10:07] goodness think about the ways he being
[1:10:09] merciful to
[1:10:14] you praise the
[1:10:16] Lord
[1:10:18] amen and then when you come out of
[1:10:20] prayer and you see the enemy flooding
[1:10:21] your thoughts with thing take the word
[1:10:24] take the Bible
[1:10:26] I mean take your Bible take your Bible
[1:10:29] not the phone
[1:10:32] Bible you know what I means because as
[1:10:35] soon as you take the phone Bible
[1:10:37] WhatsApp coming Facebook you know the
[1:10:40] finger go so quick you slip it down you
[1:10:42] you like this you like this before you
[1:10:45] realize you you you fin gone you are
[1:10:48] reading who have post what that's right
[1:10:50] you are not meditating that's right you
[1:10:53] are not communing
[1:11:01] you don't need a whole day sometime just
[1:11:03] just just five minutes 10
[1:11:06] minutes and say Lord thank you thank you
[1:11:09] for this little
[1:11:19] moment praise the Lord are we
[1:11:23] together but when you say long prayers
[1:11:26] until until he answer
[1:11:29] back that's when you are getting
[1:11:33] communion you know BR Braham say this
[1:11:36] way is is it sound it sound OD but let's
[1:11:39] let me read that again he says Lord I I
[1:11:42] I you know I will that you would do so
[1:11:44] and so and so he says and you get up and
[1:11:46] leave he says now that's really that
[1:11:49] that that really is in communion that's
[1:11:52] going and asking for favor but when you
[1:11:54] when you stay long
[1:11:57] enough praise the Lord which mean you
[1:12:01] are
[1:12:02] persistent you know the devil trying to
[1:12:04] distract you but you are
[1:12:07] persisting Lord I just want to say thank
[1:12:10] you I just want to say thank you thank
[1:12:15] you praise the Lord and you just keep
[1:12:18] pressing through when you stay long
[1:12:22] enough with the Lord now
[1:12:26] and a great way to commun is to be
[1:12:31] agreed you must agreed upon certain
[1:12:34] things and that's why we say Amen to the
[1:12:38] word praise the lord we are agreeing
[1:12:41] that's communion when the person is
[1:12:43] talking you are shaking your head yeah
[1:12:45] yeah yeah that's true yeah yeah I know I
[1:12:49] know praise the Lord so when we say Amen
[1:12:53] to the word we we are agree Lord that's
[1:13:00] truth are we
[1:13:03] together amen you see that's that's the
[1:13:06] reason why uh uh uh in most time you
[1:13:09] will see that I like to bring uh the
[1:13:11] prayer meeting before the preaching of
[1:13:12] the
[1:13:13] word because what I want to do is that
[1:13:16] uh we have spoken to the Lord I want to
[1:13:19] give him time to speak back to us am
[1:13:23] amen amen
[1:13:27] are we
[1:13:28] together
[1:13:30] amen and that's why we say Amen to the
[1:13:33] word we are agreeing with him okay let's
[1:13:35] go back now to Genesis let's go back
[1:13:38] with just from Revelation chapter 3
[1:13:39] let's go back to Genesis chapter
[1:13:42] 40 praise the Lord I'm left with uh few
[1:13:46] minutes here to to let you go
[1:13:49] home amen Genesis chapter 14 and it came
[1:13:53] to pass after this things after W thing
[1:13:56] we going back to 39 there the buler now
[1:14:00] so what I want what I want us to see now
[1:14:03] the same thing that happened to Abraham
[1:14:05] is happening to his seed because Joseph
[1:14:09] is a Seed of
[1:14:10] Abraham so God is going to commune with
[1:14:16] Joseph God is going to give him a
[1:14:20] communion praise the Lord
[1:14:23] amen God is going to give him a
[1:14:26] communion now let me let me let me say
[1:14:28] this because when you look back in
[1:14:30] Genesis 15 or or 14 that that that we
[1:14:34] that we read from
[1:14:37] amen are we together yeah Genesis 15 and
[1:14:41] 14 we were studying from you will
[1:14:42] realize that uh uh uh uh that communion
[1:14:47] is a sense of a spiritual
[1:14:52] communion amen amen
[1:14:56] because in in in in all of Abraham's
[1:15:00] Journey the only time that God was made
[1:15:03] flesh to Abraham was Genesis
[1:15:10] 18 God de with Abraham in in dreams and
[1:15:14] vision and different Supernatural
[1:15:20] experience that's the reason why Luke
[1:15:23] 17:30 is a type of re I mean uh Genesis
[1:15:29] 18 so this experience here in Genesis 14
[1:15:34] is a supernatural experience it's pretty
[1:15:37] much the very same thing that that that
[1:15:40] Joseph is experiencing
[1:15:43] Year God giving his son a
[1:15:47] communion after the battle was
[1:15:51] over praise the Lord amen amen amen
[1:15:55] after the battle was over God giving his
[1:15:58] son a communion let's go back to chapter
[1:16:00] 39 and let's see the battle that Joseph
[1:16:03] had to face amen you love the Lord
[1:16:06] tonight amen Genesis
[1:16:10] 39 and uh let's read from verse one and
[1:16:13] Joseph was brought down to Egypt and
[1:16:15] ptif fire the the officer of pharaoh
[1:16:18] captain of the guy this guy was a
[1:16:20] ranking
[1:16:22] officer amen he was a ranking
[1:16:26] officer an Egyptian H bought him of the
[1:16:30] hands of the the the
[1:16:32] ishmaelites this this guy is supposed to
[1:16:34] be his brother from from ishma but
[1:16:36] anyway let's not let us not go into that
[1:16:39] which have brought him down H him and
[1:16:42] the Lord was with Joseph and he was a
[1:16:47] prosperous man and he was in the house
[1:16:51] of his master the Egyptian and the
[1:16:53] master saw that the Lord was with him
[1:16:56] praise the Lord now this Egyptian never
[1:16:58] knew the
[1:17:01] Lord so the the the the the the phrase
[1:17:04] there and the master saw that the LA was
[1:17:06] with him he don't know the law he know
[1:17:08] the gods of
[1:17:10] Egypt it is it is a statement that means
[1:17:14] that there is something about this boy
[1:17:17] the Lord the his master saw there was
[1:17:20] something about this
[1:17:22] boy amen amen
[1:17:27] the master saw that the Lord was with
[1:17:29] him and that the Lord made all that he
[1:17:33] did prosper in his
[1:17:36] hands and Joseph found Grace in his
[1:17:39] sight and uh he and he s him and he made
[1:17:44] him overseer over his house and all that
[1:17:49] he had he put in his hands praise the
[1:17:52] Lord now so here here is the this uh H
[1:17:56] uh Egyptian uh H uh Captain you know
[1:17:59] taking this young
[1:18:01] boy Joseph was about 17 years old when
[1:18:04] he was when he was sold away from his
[1:18:06] brother taking this young young young uh
[1:18:09] uh uh boy and and uh and and uh uh and
[1:18:13] and pretty soon he realized in that
[1:18:16] since this guy being in my
[1:18:19] house things are different yes amen
[1:18:23] praise the Lord amen I don't I don't
[1:18:26] understand it I don't I really don't
[1:18:27] understand it I believe that he might
[1:18:29] have had qu he might have asked Jacob
[1:18:31] question who who is your father was was
[1:18:34] your tribe where you came
[1:18:36] from praise the Lord to to to to have
[1:18:40] such a confidence to set him over his
[1:18:45] house praise the Lord are we together
[1:18:49] glory be to God and it came to pass
[1:18:51] verse
[1:18:52] five from the time that he made him
[1:18:55] Overseer in his house and over all that
[1:18:58] he had the Lord blessed the Egyptian
[1:19:01] house for Joseph's sake and the blessing
[1:19:04] of the Lord was upon all that he had in
[1:19:07] his house and in his field the Lord was
[1:19:10] even blessing his work there was
[1:19:13] something that I was going to drop in my
[1:19:15] notes like I said on Sunday I I was I
[1:19:18] was trying to bring this this principle
[1:19:21] about communion and Tiding because right
[1:19:24] there in in Genesis chapter 14 there are
[1:19:26] two principle thing of the Christian
[1:19:29] faith amen there are two principle thing
[1:19:33] now what see what is happening here
[1:19:35] Joseph presence in portify
[1:19:39] house ptif is getting promotion in his
[1:19:42] job the Bible say even in his field
[1:19:45] Joseph is not working in his field but
[1:19:49] because of his presence so you see it's
[1:19:52] the same thing that applied to the
[1:19:55] believer when the believer grab the
[1:19:59] concept amen when they grab the
[1:20:02] spiritual
[1:20:04] concept of putting God
[1:20:07] first hallelujah praise the Lord it can
[1:20:11] even bless the economy of your company
[1:20:15] it can bless the economy of the city
[1:20:18] just because of this
[1:20:21] believer that's the principle
[1:20:30] amen that is the principle because you
[1:20:33] see God never plan to take care of us
[1:20:38] based on a nation economy no God plan to
[1:20:44] take care of us is based on his word
[1:20:47] it's based on his economy brother Bram
[1:20:50] say he will bankrupt heaven for one of
[1:20:53] his promise to f
[1:20:56] but if the people can just grab
[1:21:01] it amen if the people can just grab
[1:21:08] it and start learning to put God first
[1:21:11] not it being a struggle God want to
[1:21:13] break us from that
[1:21:16] struggle when it's a struggle then you
[1:21:19] we have not entered in it am it's
[1:21:21] something that we must love to do
[1:21:25] amen communion should be something that
[1:21:27] we must love to
[1:21:30] do Tiding should be something that we
[1:21:33] must love to
[1:21:34] do are we together now so the Lord
[1:21:39] blessed him in his field and he left all
[1:21:43] that he had in Joseph hand and he knew
[1:21:45] not he never even knew what was coming
[1:21:47] in what was going out he never knew
[1:21:51] nothing praise the Lord amen
[1:21:56] amen he was just spending I mean I mean
[1:21:59] everybody was looking at this guy I mean
[1:22:01] he was getting favor with Pharaoh he was
[1:22:05] getting he was getting promotion
[1:22:06] everybody was just looking what what
[1:22:08] what is pipy
[1:22:14] doing the Bible says everything in
[1:22:16] Joseph hand except the bread which he
[1:22:19] did
[1:22:20] eat and Joseph was a goodly person and
[1:22:25] well favored that word goodly there it
[1:22:28] means that he was a handsome boy that's
[1:22:31] where his trouble came to
[1:22:35] St he was a goodly person means that he
[1:22:38] was a hamson young
[1:22:41] man glory be to God
[1:22:45] Amen see how the devil love hamson young
[1:22:49] man and beautiful young
[1:22:52] women and it came to pass after these
[1:22:55] things there his master Wife cast her ey
[1:22:58] upon Joseph and said lied with
[1:23:06] me that's what the Bible wanted for us
[1:23:09] to
[1:23:10] watch before
[1:23:12] God will bring Joseph in a
[1:23:17] communion just like Abraham fought a
[1:23:22] battle Joseph had to fight a
[1:23:27] battle Jacob rise up with the angel all
[1:23:31] night and God brought him into communion
[1:23:34] change his name amen amen amen amen
[1:23:39] praise the Lord like we read on Sunday
[1:23:42] brother B said there is strength in the
[1:23:44] communion it changes us it bring us much
[1:23:47] closer to
[1:23:49] God it's not a ritual
[1:23:54] that's the kind of a communion I'm
[1:23:56] talking about the communion that MDES
[1:24:00] gave to Abraham was not this bread and
[1:24:03] wine that we ate on
[1:24:07] Sunday brother say it was a part of
[1:24:18] himself
[1:24:20] amen now here is this young boy not even
[1:24:23] knowing what is future in his mind he's
[1:24:25] thinking what have I done to my
[1:24:28] brothers I wish I could just keep my
[1:24:31] mouth shut is it because of my dream is
[1:24:34] it because of the CT that
[1:24:37] Daddy sold for me he just he trying to
[1:24:39] figure everything in his
[1:24:41] mind just at a time where God is giving
[1:24:44] him a a a favor and he he he's beginning
[1:24:48] to relax he's beginning to re relax his
[1:24:51] mind and now he's thinking about his
[1:24:54] brother because here say he's in plenty
[1:24:56] here say he's he's I mean he's he's over
[1:24:59] this house he's an overseer he has
[1:25:01] everything that he's need and he's

[1:45:22] bring it to
[1:45:26] terms because let me tell you before
[1:45:30] Joseph I'll give you a little Story by
[1:45:33] myself uh uh that's that's back in in
[1:45:35] Liberia you know during the
[1:45:37] war and uh I had some friends uh that
[1:45:40] were working with the peacekeeping Force
[1:45:42] and and then uh you know I gravitated to
[1:45:46] them there was there was a guy from
[1:45:47] Ghana that that we became very friendly
[1:45:50] that was just before I got saved we were
[1:45:53] very very friendly and this guy he
[1:45:55] wanted to take me to Gham with him you
[1:45:57] know I mean it was I just I just believe
[1:46:00] it was the law of favor and what
[1:46:02] happened was
[1:46:04] that he was the the chef in the house of
[1:46:09] three of the ghanians
[1:46:12] general that was a sign to the the
[1:46:15] peacekeeping force and they were the
[1:46:17] next in command to so the compound that
[1:46:21] we were in it was just was the compound
[1:46:23] of
[1:46:26] officers one of the corner would tell me
[1:46:29] when I choose to leave after I got saved
[1:46:32] I told him I I didn't want to work there
[1:46:35] anymore you would tell me he says you
[1:46:37] are a different boy he would tell me how
[1:46:40] he he placed because I was facing their
[1:46:43] rooms I go in their rooms I face their
[1:46:46] bedrooms I mean these were military
[1:46:48] men these people they were not they were
[1:46:51] not uh I mean they were not I I mean
[1:46:53] they were
[1:46:55] strangers and one of them was the uh the
[1:46:59] military police of Ghana very very very
[1:47:02] tall guy you
[1:47:06] know man the guy I mean he can smoke
[1:47:09] like oh my God this why just
[1:47:12] smoking praise the Lord but very very
[1:47:15] very very scary man I mean he was so
[1:47:18] huge very big when he when he talks he
[1:47:21] command he he don't talk he come
[1:47:27] in and I mean at the end it just I mean
[1:47:31] they would just put things down money
[1:47:33] different things in all
[1:47:35] de my M was not I didn't know that it
[1:47:38] was you know they were trying to find
[1:47:40] what kind of this this they had you know
[1:47:43] this a guy that that came to help us
[1:47:45] there and I mean after the week they
[1:47:46] jail him
[1:47:48] straight because he put something down
[1:47:50] and he stole it
[1:47:56] I mean these These are these are
[1:47:58] military guys generous they are in war
[1:48:01] zone so they are not playing they are
[1:48:03] looking for criminals they are looking
[1:48:04] for uh uh people that are on recur they
[1:48:07] I mean all of
[1:48:09] that so I'm I'm trying to say that uh

[1:48:18] tried Joseph in every way
[1:48:23] yes to make him the head of his house
[1:48:27] they might have tried him in every way
[1:48:31] yes so there is no way he could come to
[1:48:37] turn so instead of the death penalty he
[1:48:40] sent him to the dungeon life in
[1:48:45] praison that's the least he could do
[1:48:55] are we
[1:48:56] together now so uh uh uh but here's
