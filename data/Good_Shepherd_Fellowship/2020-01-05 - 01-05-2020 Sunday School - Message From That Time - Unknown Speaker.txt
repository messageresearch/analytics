[Music] as Russia will follow the United States this coming Sunday night at 12 o'clock to say many predicted Pearl Harbor they're not putting it out cause people go Frannie I don't believe it now because he can't suffer atomic war one of there's pastors a sound mayor this way we'll throw in that way in the world we'll go to pieces something's got to happen yet before Jesus comes that's right for instance the young married couple there was a certain time that they got married and they they put their bowels together and they pledged one to another their loyalty and they said that we will love honor and cherish each other as long as we both live but there come a time that something happened all these things are there's a time when something happens and maybe all their vows and all the leagues of Nations and so forth maybe had good intentions but they all come to an end all become crumbling beneath the feet of man with all the good intentions we can have or almost come to nyan but there is a time that word man can come to something that's eternal that's one on man the time man meets God that's when something happens that eternal we do our mistakes and we make our vows on New Year's nights only break them the next day we turn new pages and we assign fouls and we go to priests we don't but Catholics do it make confessions and sign pledges and we come to the altar turn new pages for our baby for the next time somebody crosses our path or something that old tip reply right back again every time that we get into trouble or something it'll happen again but there is a place where a man can come to a time that will change him forever he that will come to me I will in no wise cast out said Jesus a man can come to God and his whole eternal destination is changed and a man to meet God and he can never be the same anymore you can't meet God in there to remain the same person you are if you turn away from him you'll be a worse person than you ever were if you receive him you got eternal life and you'll raise you up at the last day by his promise there was a time when there was a man called Abraham who come down out of the Chaldeans and he dwelt in the city of aira and he was just a man a good man perhaps maybe he might Oh his father perhaps worshiped idols cause he come from Babylon and he was just an ordinary man and he was getting old he was 75 and his wife was 65 I am Abraham one day when he was perhaps out in the field hunting or whatever he was doing picking berries or whatever his job he met God and from that time he was changed he could call things that was not as though they were because he had met God he is no that minute in the hour that he met God it changed him and God called him to be the father of many nations and believe God and believe his prize the cauchy and met God 25 years later they were discussing trying to disgust him telling me he believed something was wrong but the Bible said he got stronger all the time giving praise to God because he knows that God had to keep the problem that's when a man meets God it changes his makeup it gives him a super sense does I speaking the other night the natural man only has the five senses but the believer when he meets God he gets something different it's a super-sensitive lift him up above the shadows it makes him believe things that's impossible to come to pass he still believes they will come to pass because God said so when a man meets God something takes place that was a time when a man have been trained and all the wisdom all the theology of the word of God he noted by the letter he been school he had all the degrees he was so smart until he could teach the Egyptian scholars and their teachers he's no letter but a coward with it that was run and went out the backside of the desert and was herding sheep for a stranger but there come a time that one God made there in the burning bush and from how Moses was changed because he met God in a burning bush I faced the face of God he couldn't be the same anymore when on man or woman I don't care how many vows you make er how many new pages you turn I'll tell you these God you can't be changed but when you want to meet God then you're changed forever didn't only change Moses it changed Israel a change easier and changed the world at that time they called one man that God had talking about his word what we need today is somebody to meet God face to face and talk to a bad situation one man meet God things are changed certainly that's the only way that we can have things and from that time on Moses a coward Moses is the one that was rotten has been changed and from that time he become the servant of the Lord it always works that way when a man meets God things are changed that was a little girl one time not only eighteen years older maybe not that old that was on a road to well one morning to get a bucket of water down in Nazareth she was a nice little girl she believed she had pain but that morning she met God God told her something and she believed it and it changed the whole course of life for the woman make sure tomorrow oh yeah her name was Mary the mother of our Lord Jesus the little lady was just an ordinary little girl but she met God and from that time on something happened certainly that was a man mother name of Peter an old rugged fisherman probably just as rough as they could come and he was happy a great big who shut up bully because here's some time ago I seen the play called the big fisherman not what was a very good description off Peter because he was such a big old rugged fella he didn't care for nothing he didn't believe hardly anything but one day he met God and from that time he was changed from that time he become an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ as brother David du plessis what's telling us a while ago about the Saul of Tarsus our murderer who helped to coat all the murders that and witness and give witness to the death of Stephens the martyr yet letters in his pockets that go down to the the head councils of the churches and rest the people that were making too much noise shouting and praising God he was a great man in the side of the Pharisees he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees but one day he was on his road to Damascus and he met God I like shouting around him I'm from that time home he was no more solvent but it was Paul the humble one the meat one because he met God and it changed him I was a leper laying at the gate all the remedies of the medicine could not heal him his beautified sores had gotten so great till his hands beyond raising up any more any speeding Harley dragon his case is hopeless but he met God one day coming out the gate and he fell down in worship is that if thou will doubt and make me clean and he said I will be thou clean and from that power he didn't had more leprosy because he met God there was a blind man sitting by the side of the road and he could not see the daylight from dark there was nothing could help him one day someone come walking out of the city of Jericho and we met God I'm from that time he could see his sight come to him the side of light had broke into his eyes and he could see again because from that time when he met Jesus he was a different man he had his sight one of the person me God something happens definitely there was a young man one time no doubt a good citizen of the country but spell was come on and he was so bad till the prison house couldn't hold him up and they bound him with chains and he had a lesion of devil did he break the chains and free himself and the Devils drove him to a graveyard where he stayed in there took the slabs and just don't need you to cut his ownself oh he was a terrible fella well those spells are leaving no doubt he'd think what am I doing here and about that time that Devils had come to him again and cutting and tearing but one day he met Jesus and from that time on the maniac of getting ahead is not right mine told me at his feet he could go back home as a gentleman he could return to civilization he could go back to his loved ones he could say from that time I've been changed yes one day yonder on Calvary when God and death met face to face when life and death come together but that's when live Christ pull the Stinger out of death [Music] since that time death hasn't had no stinger in it I'm so glad of that [Music] gasping God met together death hasn't been the same it ain't gonna worst angered you it down the Christian believer can walk right into its phases at home yep where is your stinger grave where is your victory why are they both met God they haven't been the same since then no man can be the same nothing can be the same when it was meets God you won't ever be the same I can remember laying on the hospital bed the doctors give me three minutes to live my heart beating 17 times to the minute God [Applause] since then I haven't been the same something happened to me no one can tell me any different something comment I've never been the same since that minute I met him he changed me he made me something different it wasn't taking a new years down but I met God many women when you ve got your changed we make our New Year vows like go back tomorrow morning to break him next day to break under what we need to do it's not a new year bother we need to come face to face with boss he was an old man one time and he couldn't make up his mind the devil kept beat him out of it one day out in the field I knelt down to pray while he was praying he drove down a stop he said let this be my sake if you ever come to me again I want you to this stop I'll tell you that right here I met God that it was settled from your own that's what we need maybe not a stop in a few home but somewhere some secret closet someplace not it Oh tonight there will be hundreds of hours taken thousands of them taken and next year we'll have to take them all over again we are saying we'll quit lines of good do we'll lay aside our tipper will do more for God will do this or that the other only the pilots in vain what man needs to do tonight is come face to face with God and from down he's a changed creature how I could tell it in a way that I believe it well when a man meets God he changed from that minute the rest of his day he'll never be the same because he's got eternal - he's a new creature old things have passed away and all things have become new to him he looks new the sick man can walk in the face of God one of the doctors who said he was going to die but he can walk in the face of God and plead his case and he'll come away and from that time on oh I remember congressman Upshaw sitting in a wheelchair for 66 years that matter in California when the Holy Spirit come down and begin to speak he met God and from that out he could walk without his crutches I've seen the time where cancer eaten people laid with nothing but a shadow and the doctors had passed by and said their dog their loved ones gather in to say the last words as they could to the encouragement but they faced God and from that time on they were changed they live differently I can see the foul woman your honor on the street I can see the drunkard down an alley I can see the hypocrite dollar in the church all those different kinds of people each new year turning a new sheet and trying to do something different trying to make restitution to do so forth let them meet God one time and from then on Jesus preached to those from then on that said in the regions of the shadow death and I say tonight if a man wants to have a real change come on in let him come face to face with God a medium one time then you could say from there from that time on I was a changed man I know by experience in a little while the church will be gathering here around the altar you'll be consecrating your lives anew you'll be giving up things and laying things on the altar rather let me give you some advice if you've never met God face to face let me tell you something you stay at that altar just stay there until you meet God then you can port your fingers back to that New Year night not say I've turned a new page I made a new vow but from that time on I met God and lifeless change and things were different and everything becomes new chilly again from that time on the time that you meet God it ain't meet a new year we're gonna face it in a few minutes after all about two and a half hours are supposed maybe less than that we'll be meeting our new year face to face we'll meet it with vowels we'll meet it with pledges we'll meet it with good intention we'll meet it say we'll try to turn a new page we'll try to do different that's all good I appreciate that brother it'll never be turtle I'll tell you to meet God first when you meet God first and from then on everything will be different let us pray when we bow our heads praise the Lord yeah I was just waiting for the prayer I think there was a little miscalculation day I asked for the last five minutes to introduce a subject and I think that was where all this happened I'll just waiting next week God willing we'll be starting a new topic I know we got through with the prayer last the very last week or so of December in the week before the last and before the year even ended I think probably 3-4 months to the end of the year I was thinking of the redemption plan of God but for some reason this came in so hard and I just put it on the Shelf so we are going to talk about tithing we are going to talk about tithing God willing I know when it comes to money Marez is almost like a no-go area people people don't feel very comfortable when we are talking about money issues in church it's not to maybe show who is paying tight and who is not paying tight I am not even in a position to know who preached that and who doesn't probably it rather steve is doing it that's a different thing why rather one is doing it that is a different thing but I don't know who paid tax and who doesn't so be rest assured you wouldn't feel bad and yeah so we just have to talk about it you know we don't talk about things because it's within our comfort zone that doesn't help us in any way so we are going to talk about tithing God willing next week it's not only for the waking brothers if you intend to wake is also for you and even if you decide you are never going to wake is also for you bill you can never tell when somebody one day hand you a hundred times a hundred thousand dollar check for deciding not to wake so um it's all for is for every one of us and it's a very good and I think and there is just a little secret someone which i think is very very important for us to know it's not just about pee in tights you can pay ties every single paycheck or every every end in you make you can be so diligent and so up to the task and still you will not be blessed why because there are rules to every game there is something very very small as small as it may be I think that carries the whole blessing and I think it will help us if we all come and then just see which will God leaves us so just be praying for it remember me in prayer and then God willing next Sunday is a very short topic probably three four Sundays we'll be done with it I'm not sure because most of the times I start something and then just keep coming and then that time yes by this time I'm trusting that maybe in three four weeks we'll be done with this and it's very very important tied in don't forget god bless you [Music] [Music]
