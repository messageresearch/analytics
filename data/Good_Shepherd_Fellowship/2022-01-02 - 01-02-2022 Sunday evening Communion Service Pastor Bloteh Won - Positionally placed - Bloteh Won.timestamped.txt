[35:02] i called only one eight i didn't call
[35:03] the one
[35:07] so which meant i'm getting cross eyes
[35:13] sorry it's chapter two verse 18.
[35:17] let no man beguile you
[35:19] of your reward in voluntary immunity and
[35:22] worshipping of angers
[35:25] and trolling into those things which he
[35:27] have not seen

[35:36] i will come back to that again
[35:38] and now holding the head
[35:42] from which all the body
[35:46] by joined and then having nourishment
[35:49] minister not together
[35:52] increase with the increase of god
[35:56] wherefore if ye be dead
[35:58] with christ from the rudiment of the
[36:00] word why
[36:03] as though living in the word ye are

[41:16] and and and then we show how
[41:19] [Music]
[41:22] at the time of their natural birth

[43:31] you know i
[43:32] asked him i said well uh uh think about
[43:36] the song
[43:37] mary did you know you're a little boy
[43:40] now now uh the one that we're singing
[43:42] about is jesus is he a little boy they
[43:44] said no
[43:47] then i said okay
[43:49] uh
[43:51] you know now if we
[43:52] sing this song mary did you know that
[43:55] your little boy will walk on walter
[43:58] you know uh uh
[44:01] in one sense we're still making jesus a
[44:04] little boy
[44:05] so which means every time his birthday
[44:07] come he will be a little boy
[44:10] you know and every time his birthday
[44:12] mary did you know your little boy
[44:17] and uh just talking with those with
[44:20] those little ones and little girls
[44:23] it was it was amazing to see how
[44:27] they could quickly come to understanding
[44:31] that
[44:35] this would just only be a song
[44:38] but it would not be appropriate
[44:42] to worship jesus because he's not a
[44:44] little one
[44:47] praise the lord
[44:49] as much as it sounds it has merit that
[44:52] you know your little boy will walk on
[44:54] water you know it has all of this but
[44:56] it's not appropriate
[45:01] why because uh uh is is placing you you
[45:04] see is is that cultural set of mind
[45:08] the person that wrote that song wrote
[45:10] the song for christmas
[45:13] with the mind that jesus is in the
[45:16] manger
[45:20] praise the lord
[45:22] which of course is a it's a a gospel
[45:25] songwriter by mike larry he wrote that
[45:27] song and uh
[45:29] but
[45:30] you know if you really bring it to term
[45:32] to look at it and it just amazes me the
[45:35] reason why i'm saying it is because
[45:39] you see
[45:41] the good conscious towards god
[45:44] that the word of god brings to the heart
[45:47] of even the little ones
[45:51] they might not have the kind of a
[45:52] revelation that you have they might not
[45:55] have that be able to dig in the word and
[45:57] but just to see the the the good
[46:00] conscious
[46:02] that they can be able to quickly grab it
[46:04] and says oh yeah wow
[46:09] praise the lord
[46:12] well i mean if it were if it was if it
[46:14] was uh you know uh uh uh
[46:17] uh
[46:19] another song i think they would have
[46:21] done a good job
[46:22] but now so this is what i'm talking you
[46:25] know so it all comes back to that early
[46:27] experience when god start dealing with
[46:29] us as as children many times
[46:33] we parents we struggle with it because
[46:35] you know
[46:36] in in our mind we are looking looking to
[46:38] see our children having the holy ghost
[46:40] speaking in tongues prophesying you know
[46:42] bringing visions when we ourselves have
[46:44] not got there yet
[46:47] and then
[46:48] you know and then we put all of this
[46:50] pressure on them
[46:52] uh uh with with this expectation you
[46:55] know the message say you shouldn't do
[46:57] that you know the message that you and
[46:58] that and and and and
[47:01] and we don't find a time to be able to
[47:04] nourish what the grace of god is doing
[47:06] in their life and how god is dealing
[47:08] with them the little things that they
[47:10] are recognizing the little things that
[47:12] you know the lord is helping them wave
[47:14] water is to be able to read their
[47:15] devotional or to be able to pray before
[47:17] they go to bed and and all of that we
[47:20] don't we don't seem to nourish those
[47:22] things but we want to see them you know
[47:25] why you know you you have that mind
[47:27] that's that's you know that's every
[47:29] parent uh uh uh
[47:32] uh
[47:32] subconscious things that we we gear
[47:35] right into you have that mind to see
[47:37] them doing the right thing you know uh
[47:40] but it it all goes back to us in our
[47:42] early walk with christ you know so the
[47:45] mothers there the the you know the
[47:48] the prophesied that the the groaning
[47:50] they were honored as they called this
[47:52] child out and and the things they said
[47:54] over the child became uh uh uh you know
[47:58] uh the order of their life where they
[48:01] would have been then we also look at
[48:03] genesis 49 where we see the father and
[48:06] on on his die in bed he comes back and
[48:09] then he called each of his sons and then
[48:13] he blessed him but the bible says that
[48:16] he says come and gather i will tell you
[48:18] things that is concerning you to the
[48:19] last day
[48:21] things that
[48:23] is concerning you to the last day so we
[48:25] see the mother as the alpha the
[48:28] beginning of their experience and we see
[48:30] the father which of course that's what
[48:32] the father is he's the provider he's the
[48:34] seer of the home he looks far ahead
[48:37] praise the lord now
[48:41] beautiful enough we we we see moses the
[48:44] prophet also coming there in deuteronomy
[48:46] 33 and he's taking you know he's taking
[48:49] that very thing because they're about to
[48:51] go over jordan he's not going with them
[48:54] joshua is going to positionally place
[48:56] them in the lane but then he's taking
[48:58] that again and then he's laying it out
[49:00] and we see how he did it by inspiration
[49:04] because of what jacob has said moses
[49:06] took a different order that right after
[49:09] rubin he called judah and then he called
[49:11] levi in what in one of you
[49:13] now so but the thing that uh uh you know
[49:17] uh uh that was kind of for driving our
[49:20] our inspiration this morning is to see
[49:24] that how with with the promise that was
[49:26] giving these people even though they
[49:28] went over to the natural land that the
[49:30] you know joshua divided the land to them
[49:33] you know some were able to to to to take
[49:36] their territory some compromise on their
[49:38] territory and all of that now we see is
[49:41] is it's a physical land but we also
[49:44] realize here there is a spiritual part
[49:47] you know that will that will show up
[49:49] later on you know they they they stay in
[49:52] their possession they did whatever they
[49:54] wanted to do and the years went back and
[49:57] in all of that and then coming showing
[49:58] right over in the book of revelation we
[50:00] see that god
[50:03] on the inspiration is is becoming
[50:06] conscious of something that took place
[50:08] you know uh uh uh in the history
[50:12] something that took place in their work
[50:15] something that well that uh uh you know
[50:18] uh uh
[50:19] the mob says well we didn't have no
[50:21] choice you know
[50:22] uh uh or maybe they were driving by
[50:24] their you know uh the uh the uh
[50:27] political party at that time you know
[50:30] because richie brown came out and said
[50:32] sir my father there with you this way
[50:34] and i'm going to deal with you like a
[50:36] scorpion so they said oh now we don't
[50:37] want you we just joined with jerry brown
[50:39] but to realize to see how this man
[50:42] raised us something in israel that
[50:44] became
[50:45] a sin for many generations the people
[50:48] struggle their struggle his struggle it
[50:50] took them into captivity with the
[50:52] assyrians they came out they took them
[50:54] into captivity with the babylon just
[50:57] because of that evil that was set up and
[51:02] and it's all the form of idolatry amen
[51:06] now so we we bring that down and and and
[51:09] try to compare it with uh with our with
[51:13] our walk that's what we were trying to
[51:15] do you know just like jesus said that
[51:18] the race is not to the swathe
[51:20] but he that endureth
[51:22] to the end
[51:23] the same shall be saved
[51:26] praise the lord
[51:27] many of the people that have you know
[51:29] that have uh uh you know uh uh left
[51:33] following christ and have stepped down
[51:35] the astender left the message you know
[51:38] many of those people will say just like
[51:40] we can say today
[51:44] i would lay down my life for this word i
[51:46] would die for this message
[51:50] peter did it right in the face of christ
[51:54] say over my dear body
[51:56] any man would touch you
[51:58] and he meant what he said because he
[52:00] took out a sword and cut someone's ears
[52:02] off
[52:05] but just before the day break
[52:08] he denied the lord
[52:11] three times
[52:15] praise the lord
[52:16] so you see it brings us to the place
[52:19] it's i'm not preaching this uh uh a
[52:22] scare tati message here if you're
[52:24] feeding into a ski uh fear channel you
[52:26] better disconnect because that's not
[52:28] what i'm doing
[52:29] i'm not trying to make you scary
[52:31] praise the lord
[52:32] because the message that make you scary
[52:34] your soul don't feed on it
[52:36] it's emotional only your spirit feed on
[52:39] it
[52:40] praise the lord
[52:42] and so
[52:43] uh uh
[52:45] so what what we're trying to to help us
[52:48] to see here is the other this is what it
[52:50] is i read a quote here uh uh uh some
[52:53] time ago
[52:54] and and and where brother branham talks
[52:57] about how you can you can lose your
[53:00] your adoption
[53:03] you don't lose your sonship
[53:05] but you can lose your place
[53:08] it's shown all in the scripture we also
[53:10] talk about that how how the the first
[53:13] bone has always been swapping but that's
[53:16] a beautiful picture to be able to
[53:17] understand why the new birth is very
[53:20] important because you look all through
[53:22] the scripture uh king was the first born
[53:25] of of of eve but then a set took his
[53:29] place
[53:32] amen
[53:33] esau came out first but jacob
[53:36] took his place
[53:38] joseph brought madison and in front
[53:40] before him but the hand was crossed
[53:43] the younger one took his place now so
[53:45] you see jerry said that the scripture
[53:48] has
[53:49] a principle for the first born
[53:54] the firstborn has the breath right
[53:58] amen
[53:59] but you look all through the scripture
[54:01] aaron was the older brother but moses
[54:03] came in and he and he took the place
[54:06] david was the younger brother but yet
[54:07] over all his brother god honor him so
[54:10] you see god on a shadow was pointing to
[54:13] the new birth
[54:18] your first birth is your first bone
[54:23] praise the lord your first birth is your
[54:26] first born that has all the ethnic
[54:28] rights
[54:29] it had the right to lie it had the right
[54:32] to steal it had the right to do
[54:34] everything that is wrong because it's
[54:36] born in sin and shipley in iniquity
[54:44] your first born is your first birth
[54:48] praise the lord
[54:50] amen
[54:51] but we see in the scripture how god
[54:54] on the shadow slowly
[54:57] he started bringing in
[55:00] the one that was not considered the one
[55:02] that was hating
[55:06] and he brings brings that one out to
[55:09] prominence
[55:11] he brings that one out to a place
[55:16] like even uh a jeff time
[55:19] despised upon his brothers
[55:22] but yet god will bring him to a place
[55:24] where he will be the one that will
[55:26] deliver
[55:28] the people and he will be a judge over
[55:30] them
[55:33] so you see god
[55:36] hear the mystery of the new birth
[55:42] praise the lord
[55:44] he hear the mystery of the new birth
[55:51] just like
[55:52] branham shared you know talking about
[55:55] those mystery the measured of the new
[55:56] birth you know uh uh uh uh uh the holy
[56:00] ghost without sensation
[56:05] are we together
[56:07] so i mean
[56:08] that's that's what god was doing
[56:12] and that's what he's doing
[56:15] he's majoring on that new birth
[56:20] your your your body is going through
[56:22] struggle and different things are
[56:24] happening on you but the thing that god
[56:27] is building is the character that goes
[56:29] to that new birth
[56:33] praise the lord
[56:35] the first brother you look at the the
[56:37] prodigal son the firstborn he's the one
[56:40] that is complaining
[56:43] praise the lord
[56:46] but a younger son came back and then he
[56:49] became the one that was adopted
[56:56] so that's that's what i want you to grab
[57:00] it's not that uh you know the word of
[57:02] god or the message wants to be lazy the
[57:04] message don't want us to do anything i
[57:07] mean in everything that we find
[57:09] ourselves doing everything that we lay
[57:11] our hands to do on you have to realize
[57:14] that wherever you find yourself even
[57:16] stay in your bedroom
[57:18] lock the door close down the blind in
[57:20] that darkness god is going to use that
[57:23] darkness to beat you
[57:27] praise the lord
[57:29] he's going to meet that use that
[57:31] darkness to meet you you might get scary
[57:34] and look for light
[57:37] so you see
[57:38] that's that's what he's working on
[57:42] he's working
[57:43] on that birth
[57:47] it is his life
[57:50] that he has given to us
[57:55] are we together
[57:57] amen
[57:59] i heard someone say something they said
[58:02] his story has taught us a lesson
[58:05] that man has never learned from history
[58:13] praise the lord
[58:19] one last in truth there is that many
[58:21] i've never learned from history because
[58:23] and you see yeah it's just like verbatim
[58:25] said he says the devil steady us
[58:30] he said to us he if if he can just if he
[58:35] can just uh uh uh uh you know uh
[58:39] uh allowed us to get to the place where
[58:41] we can get passion about something or
[58:43] passionate about some he knows he knows
[58:46] how to work in that spirit realm
[58:52] he knows how to work in that spirit
[58:54] frame
[58:55] he knows how how to trap us
[58:59] you know the the people that don't know
[59:01] god well he can use all the things
[59:03] around them but for you that is desiring
[59:05] god he's always getting in that spirit
[59:08] room trying to use one of the senses of
[59:10] the spirit to always get at you
[59:12] now so that's that's what we were trying
[59:14] to to show this morning what we were
[59:17] trying to show there is that the you
[59:20] know uh let us not
[59:22] allow the enemy to create any form of
[59:26] idol in our spirit let's make no man an
[59:28] idol amen
[59:30] that let us make end nothing on otto the
[59:32] not the church and now the pastor not
[59:34] just no man and adam let's let's uh you
[59:37] know let's let's be able to move on with
[59:39] god don't make an idea an adult don't
[59:41] make a revelation an idol praise the
[59:43] lord having a revelation or
[59:45] understanding of the word do not make it
[59:47] because that is the very same thing that
[59:49] paul is addressing here
[59:54] that's the very thing that he's
[59:55] addressing with this church and he dealt
[59:57] with the same thing in the book of
[59:58] hebrew so we realize here but the thing
[1:00:01] that is that that is beautiful here is
[1:00:03] that he's using that very same world be
[1:00:06] god he says don't let no man begot you
[1:00:11] of your reward
[1:00:15] now that's the place where
[1:00:19] the emphasis was on this morning
[1:00:21] the inheritance was their reward
[1:00:24] right
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:27] it was a physical reward and it was also
[1:00:30] a spiritual reward
[1:00:33] because you have to know that the
[1:00:36] the the the 24 others
[1:00:39] when brother branham talks about the 24
[1:00:40] headers he make us to realize that it's
[1:00:43] made of the patriots
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:47] they are going to they are going to have
[1:00:50] that as a reward
[1:00:57] are we together
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:02] he said so don't don't don't allow any
[1:01:04] man to beguile you of your reward or
[1:01:07] stop you from getting into the fullness
[1:01:10] of your reward
[1:01:13] don't allow them man to be your reward
[1:01:16] christ is our reward
[1:01:19] are we together
[1:01:22] now so as he dealt with this
[1:01:26] he gets down and and and uh and and and
[1:01:29] if you watch what he's saying here you
[1:01:32] know uh uh
[1:01:35] we got you of your reward in a voluntary
[1:01:38] humanitarian worshipping of angels and
[1:01:41] intruding into those things which he
[1:01:43] have not seen you know where people can
[1:01:46] be so mystical
[1:01:51] you know and and people can and can word
[1:01:54] just on supernatural gifts and super all
[1:01:57] of those things they are beautiful
[1:01:59] but the thing about it there is that let
[1:02:01] every experience
[1:02:03] that you have draw you closer to god
[1:02:08] let it throw you right in the arms of
[1:02:10] god
[1:02:13] praise the lord don't stay with the
[1:02:15] experience
[1:02:17] and leave the word
[1:02:21] every experience must put you right in
[1:02:23] the hand of christ
[1:02:25] because he is your bridegroom
[1:02:30] he's granting you that experience
[1:02:32] because he want to draw you into a more
[1:02:35] intimate relationship he want to draw
[1:02:38] you into a closer walk
[1:02:40] but yeah he's talking about how people
[1:02:43] can be begotten of their reward by all
[1:02:47] of this angel worship and all you know
[1:02:50] trying to make things more mystical and
[1:02:53] and all of that
[1:02:55] and pretty soon
[1:02:57] is just all about themself
[1:03:01] trying to establish themselves in their
[1:03:04] own mind or in the minds of the people
[1:03:13] praise the lord
[1:03:23] now just like we saw in the scripture
[1:03:26] i have to close here now
[1:03:28] just like we saw in the scripture we
[1:03:29] realized that that was the thing that
[1:03:32] that that that that was that was
[1:03:34] terrible about this whole jeroboam thing
[1:03:37] that was the thing that was terrible
[1:03:39] about it
[1:03:41] because he was not concerned about
[1:03:44] the house of god or about the people
[1:03:46] getting closer to god he was just
[1:03:48] concerned about holding the people to
[1:03:51] himself
[1:03:53] and as long as he can be able to give
[1:03:55] them an idol this is the god that
[1:03:57] brought you out of egypt
[1:04:01] going over there is enough
[1:04:04] as long as he was able to get the people
[1:04:07] to come short
[1:04:12] of getting to the temple where they saw
[1:04:14] the shaykh
[1:04:15] coming down
[1:04:18] they saw the glory of god as long as he
[1:04:20] was able to get the people coming short
[1:04:23] of getting into the presence of god
[1:04:26] taking something for a substitute
[1:04:31] thy thing became an idol
[1:04:34] that god did not forget
[1:04:40] he did not forget that
[1:04:44] so in revelation he was trying to show
[1:04:46] because if you read revelation chapter
[1:04:48] seven you see that but if you go to
[1:04:50] revelation chapter 14 that the entire
[1:04:53] trap is back
[1:04:58] which of course over in ezekiel the
[1:04:59] entire trap is back that that that is in
[1:05:02] the millennium but you see god was
[1:05:04] showing in in in
[1:05:06] in type
[1:05:08] what happened to uh uh dan and ephraim
[1:05:12] you remember that in the scripture where
[1:05:14] the bible says ephraim has joined
[1:05:15] himself to un to his idol
[1:05:22] praise the lord
[1:05:25] and we we're living
[1:05:28] in uh
[1:05:29] in this age
[1:05:31] you remember brother branham talking
[1:05:33] about
[1:05:34] uh
[1:05:35] you know the statue being built
[1:05:38] the image being built he says the stone
[1:05:41] cut out of the mountain with our hands
[1:05:43] struck down your image and started to
[1:05:44] build a spiritual kingdom but then he
[1:05:47] make us to understand
[1:05:48] that
[1:05:49] the kingdom was built from the feet up
[1:05:53] and now he says we are in the eye edge
[1:05:58] he says there is nothing above that
[1:06:00] beside the intelligence
[1:06:02] the intelligence which is christ himself
[1:06:06] in the ih
[1:06:07] he he hold it down to
[1:06:09] uh a prophet because a prophet is a seer
[1:06:13] praise the lord
[1:06:15] that's spiritual that's dispensational
[1:06:21] but even physical we are in the eye age
[1:06:24] because everything that the enemy will
[1:06:26] use in this age and time to get at us
[1:06:32] he has put it on display
[1:06:39] praise the lord
[1:06:41] he has put it on this play
[1:06:49] so we see all of that that is the way
[1:06:52] of trying to
[1:06:55] to be god our mind
[1:06:59] of either being attached to some you
[1:07:01] know uh uh uh uh individual
[1:07:04] i mean it's it's just a soft i think
[1:07:08] appreciating the brother appreciating
[1:07:09] their sister there is nothing wrong with
[1:07:11] that
[1:07:13] but you see it becomes so subtitled that
[1:07:15] the enemy can just
[1:07:17] makes it so easy
[1:07:20] for you to stop at that
[1:07:22] that don't tell that guy say anything
[1:07:27] instead of getting to christ
[1:07:30] and say i want to see what the lord will
[1:07:31] say
[1:07:34] even if he would say anything to me let
[1:07:36] me see what god would say through him
[1:07:43] praise the lord
[1:07:47] that's how
[1:07:48] that's how uh
[1:07:51] uh terrible it is
[1:07:54] brother branham shared
[1:07:55] uh
[1:07:57] he said this in the in the in the seven
[1:08:00] in the seven uh
[1:08:03] seven seals message he said
[1:08:05] they she said he talking about the same
[1:08:07] thing he says and also in revelation 14
[1:08:10] john seen them again in the troubled
[1:08:12] order that's the two of tribes he said
[1:08:15] that's right every tribe to his place
[1:08:17] what happened now remember
[1:08:20] he said under the heavens
[1:08:24] that his name will be blotted out
[1:08:28] blotted out of the tribe's fed under the
[1:08:31] heavens as long as
[1:08:33] as long as
[1:08:36] he was under the heavens
[1:08:38] there will be
[1:08:40] no more
[1:08:42] and this hundred and forty-four thousand
[1:08:45] is done here in in a tribal part yeah he
[1:08:50] says you see they have been blinded
[1:08:58] they have only
[1:09:00] the sacrifice of bulls and god
[1:09:04] he blotted them out under the heavens
[1:09:08] but
[1:09:09] the gentile
[1:09:10] in the days of the holy spirit
[1:09:13] against that your name
[1:09:17] he says your name was taken completely
[1:09:20] off the book of life and could never
[1:09:22] have
[1:09:23] have forgiveness in this word or in the
[1:09:27] world to come now so what what he's
[1:09:30] trying to put together here is that
[1:09:33] because in revelation seven
[1:09:36] two of the tribe means were blooded out
[1:09:39] and then when you come to revelation 14
[1:09:42] the entire order was put back together
[1:09:46] now so brother branham is trying to to
[1:09:49] make us to understand here because what
[1:09:52] is happening
[1:09:53] that is exactly what paul talks about
[1:09:56] that man over there in uh uh
[1:10:02] corinthians chapter 5 that we read about
[1:10:04] let's let's just read a scripture here
[1:10:06] and then i will find a place to close
[1:10:10] amen
[1:10:12] i will find a place to close
[1:10:31] let's go to first corinthians chapter
[1:10:33] three
[1:10:35] i've spoken this before
[1:10:44] now this is paul now talking here he
[1:10:46] says verse 9.
[1:10:49] for we are liberals together with god
[1:10:51] we are girl husbandry
[1:10:53] yeah
[1:10:54] a god's building according to the grace
[1:10:57] of god which is given unto me
[1:10:59] as a wise masturbator
[1:11:01] i have laid the foundation
[1:11:04] and another men built their own but let
[1:11:07] every man take he
[1:11:09] how
[1:11:10] he build their own
[1:11:13] now he's making us to be cautious again
[1:11:16] now for us to be afraid
[1:11:18] amen he's telling you watch your
[1:11:21] environment
[1:11:22] watch what you are doing
[1:11:24] let's go on a little bit now he says uh
[1:11:28] uh
[1:11:30] for all the foundation can no man lay
[1:11:33] then that which is laid which is jesus
[1:11:36] christ
[1:11:38] now if any man build upon this
[1:11:41] foundation
[1:11:42] gold silver and precious stones will
[1:11:45] heal and stable every man work shall be
[1:11:48] made manifest
[1:11:51] for the day shall declare it because
[1:11:54] it shall be revealed by fire
[1:11:58] praise the lord
[1:11:59] now you see fire cannot burn gold off
[1:12:04] fire can only make gold to shine
[1:12:07] brighter
[1:12:09] fire would do the same thing to savor
[1:12:13] fire will do the same thing to any
[1:12:15] precious storms
[1:12:18] but it's different you put fire on wood
[1:12:21] you have this building coming down
[1:12:24] praise the lord
[1:12:25] if you put fire on hell
[1:12:28] you'll have this whole place burned
[1:12:33] are we together
[1:12:34] now so let's let's go in a little bit
[1:12:36] yeah he says every man work shall be
[1:12:38] made manifest for the day shall declare
[1:12:40] it because it shall be revered by fire
[1:12:44] and the fire shall try every man works
[1:12:47] of what sought it is if any man work at
[1:12:50] bad
[1:12:52] which he have built there on he shall
[1:12:54] receive a reward so you see the same
[1:12:57] thing again the reward
[1:13:00] but but watch this now if any men work
[1:13:03] shall be burned he shall suffer lost
[1:13:07] what does that mean means that you are
[1:13:09] you're all about yourself
[1:13:13] you are not you are not you are not
[1:13:15] doing you are not working in you know
[1:13:17] what to glorify god it was is i mean if
[1:13:21] it is god-giving
[1:13:24] then it's pressure stones
[1:13:26] then it's go it's god that gave god if
[1:13:28] god i gave savior is god i gave precious
[1:13:31] stones it's man i made wood
[1:13:34] he cut the tree down
[1:13:36] and he saw it in make wood it's a man
[1:13:39] that makes help he gathered in the field
[1:13:42] and he put it together and makes hell
[1:13:45] are you grabbing the concept that i'm
[1:13:48] trying to deal with you
[1:13:49] amen
[1:13:50] so he's bringing us to the place of
[1:13:52] consciousness let's watch our walk with
[1:13:55] god
[1:13:57] as we move over into our inheritance
[1:14:00] it's all about god
[1:14:04] it's not about man it's not about you
[1:14:06] it's all about god
[1:14:14] praise the lord
[1:14:16] now that man went and did something
[1:14:18] wrong paul said excommunicate him to the
[1:14:20] devil
[1:14:22] so his flesh can be punished
[1:14:26] why he did that
[1:14:30] why he did that
[1:14:32] the reason is because he wanted
[1:14:35] the the proudness of that flesh
[1:14:38] because the problem was he did wrong and
[1:14:41] he was proud about it
[1:14:44] he then had a repentant heart
[1:14:47] he was a good brother
[1:14:50] but he was proud about it he was a seed
[1:14:52] of god but he was proud about he was
[1:14:54] just dealing with a pride and an
[1:14:56] arrogant spirit
[1:14:58] and all he needed to do was get in a
[1:15:00] situation where he would get on his
[1:15:02] knees and cry to god for mercy
[1:15:06] and sometimes that is just what god's
[1:15:08] children need
[1:15:11] they just need a little spanking from
[1:15:13] the father
[1:15:17] praise the lord
[1:15:22] in second corinthians he came back
[1:15:24] repenting paul says you're bringing me
[1:15:26] he's a brother
[1:15:29] don't start looking at him funny
[1:15:32] praise the lord
[1:15:34] amen because we know about his own we
[1:15:36] don't know about yours yet
[1:15:44] praise the lord
[1:15:46] we know about his we don't know about
[1:15:47] yours yet so don't look at him funny
[1:15:56] so you see it's all about him
[1:16:01] all about him
[1:16:03] sometimes god
[1:16:05] were allowed and put us in a situation
[1:16:09] it's almost like
[1:16:12] telling brother branham
[1:16:14] that there is a trial and not telling
[1:16:16] him what the trial is
[1:16:20] and the man
[1:16:23] brother branham has the gift of
[1:16:24] evangelist
[1:16:26] because in the fight for ministry is the
[1:16:28] two gifts that is honor the ego
[1:16:30] anointing an evangelist and a prophet
[1:16:34] so
[1:16:35] you know he the way he blasts in
[1:16:38] you know and people call him woman hater
[1:16:40] and whatever they want to say
[1:16:42] because i mean he would just tear
[1:16:44] everything down
[1:16:46] but
[1:16:46] yet
[1:16:48] right there a young man and young woman
[1:16:50] making love in the church
[1:16:53] you know a lostful spirit just came on
[1:16:55] them right in service
[1:16:59] and all because
[1:17:01] god
[1:17:03] was watching to see what
[1:17:06] his seven would do
[1:17:10] praise the lord all church members they
[1:17:12] can talk
[1:17:14] how the pastor can compromise he favors
[1:17:16] certain people
[1:17:18] i was there i saw them i saw them he
[1:17:20] never said nothing
[1:17:22] nothing he didn't say it about it
[1:17:25] he jokingly telling a young man you'll
[1:17:27] stop there if that my own child he will
[1:17:29] start rebuking them
[1:17:34] but that did not have anything to do
[1:17:36] with you
[1:17:37] that did not have anything to do with
[1:17:39] those young people
[1:17:40] they were just the instrument used
[1:17:43] because god
[1:17:44] was testing his seven
[1:17:51] and the law said because you did not
[1:17:53] condemn them
[1:17:54] you have passed the test
[1:17:58] and that's how sometimes we grow in
[1:18:00] grace the lord bless us our spiritual
[1:18:02] life is coming up you know we're
[1:18:04] receiving revelation from the world we
[1:18:06] are praying we are consecrating
[1:18:07] ourselves then a little trial just come
[1:18:10] along
[1:18:12] and the way you would deal with that
[1:18:16] he would either have to step you back a
[1:18:18] little bit
[1:18:19] he said go back you need to go back and
[1:18:22] work on this
[1:18:25] or the way you would deal with that he
[1:18:27] would give you a helping hand i think i
[1:18:29] need to bring you up a little closer
[1:18:37] praise the lord
[1:18:39] instead of us being i i seven and men
[1:18:42] seven
[1:18:43] looking at looking at us
[1:18:46] we better be looking up
[1:18:48] the lord bless you tonight
[1:18:54] let's buy our house together

[1:32:06] 23
[1:32:08] for i have received of the lord that
[1:32:10] which
[1:32:11] also i deliver unto you that the lord
[1:32:14] jesus the same night
[1:32:16] in which he was betrayed took bread
[1:32:19] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:32:21] and said take
[1:32:23] it
[1:32:26] this is my body
[1:32:28] which is broken for you
[1:32:31] this do in remembrance
[1:32:35] of me what a way to remember the
[1:32:38] lord people that's that's that's the
[1:32:41] purpose of the communion
[1:32:43] the purpose of the communion is not your
[1:32:45] spiritual status
[1:32:48] it's not where you are in your walk with
[1:32:50] god
[1:32:51] the purpose of the communion is to
[1:32:53] remember the lord
[1:32:58] to remember the lord
[1:33:00] you see the devil in his blame game
[1:33:04] oh you say you are this oh you are not
[1:33:06] that and so it gets in our head
[1:33:10] until
[1:33:12] we make this thing order by ourselves
[1:33:14] and where we are with god
[1:33:17] it's about him
[1:33:19] the purpose of the communion is to
[1:33:21] remember him
[1:33:23] how how do we want to remember him
[1:33:25] tonight
[1:33:28] you see just like brother branham said
[1:33:30] revelation series he said the body of
[1:33:32] jesus set on the throne as a memorial
[1:33:36] the only thing that is left with us as a
[1:33:39] memorial is this
[1:33:42] this is just a memorial we are not
[1:33:45] catholics this is not the literal blood
[1:33:47] and the literal body of jesus
[1:33:51] praise the lord
[1:33:52] we are not cut it's a sign that many
[1:33:54] people around the message try to become
[1:33:57] catholic in that way
[1:33:59] praise the lord
[1:34:00] they can they can disregard this word
[1:34:04] and then when it comes to communion they
[1:34:05] want to become
[1:34:07] like some kind of a nun or catholic
[1:34:09] priest
[1:34:10] this word is higher than this ordinance
[1:34:13] [Music]
[1:34:17] we are just coming to remember the law
[1:34:20] we take a reflection of what his grace
[1:34:23] has done
[1:34:24] that if it was not his grace we will not
[1:34:26] be here
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:35] there's two in remembrance of me
[1:34:38] after the same manner he took the cup
[1:34:41] when he had saw saying this this cup is
[1:34:45] the new testament of my blood
[1:34:48] this two year as of as he drink it in
[1:34:52] remembrance of me
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:56] for us as often as
[1:34:59] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:35:01] show the lord's death till he comes
[1:35:04] wherefore whosoever eat this bread
[1:35:07] and drink this cup of the lord on
[1:35:10] waterling you are not remembering him
[1:35:12] the right way if you think you can just
[1:35:15] come and become part of the communion
[1:35:17] and live any kind of a life it's a wrong
[1:35:19] way to remember him
[1:35:21] it's the wrong way
[1:35:23] and and and you're going to pay for it
[1:35:26] praise the lord we are not taking
[1:35:28] sacrifice from the communion
[1:35:30] we must be able to approach it with
[1:35:32] reverence
[1:35:33] we must be able to approach it with the
[1:35:34] right kind of a lie because that's the
[1:35:36] way we want to remember him
[1:35:40] praise the lord
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:46] wherefore whosoever eat this bread drink
[1:35:48] this cup of the lord on waterling shall
[1:35:51] be guilty
[1:35:53] of the body
[1:35:54] and the blood of the lord
[1:35:56] but let a manners examine himself
[1:36:05] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:36:07] eat
[1:36:08] of that bread
[1:36:10] and drink of that cup
[1:36:13] for he that eat it and drink it on water
[1:36:15] and eat it
[1:36:16] and bring a damnation to himself
[1:36:19] not discerning
[1:36:20] the lord's body
[1:36:25] for this cause many are shaking we
[1:36:27] we execute them on you
[1:36:30] and many sleep
