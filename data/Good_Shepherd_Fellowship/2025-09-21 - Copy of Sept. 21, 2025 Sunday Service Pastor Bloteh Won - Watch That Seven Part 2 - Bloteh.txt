Oh son come to be the leading one at the leading. [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. The time is far spent. Sorry that I had to come out late this morning but uh it's okay. Thank you for the music. Let's take our Bibles. Matthew chapter 17. Matthew chapter 17. Matthew chapter 17. Praise the Lord. We started um another we started another uh I don't know if I would say the sequence because we uh we have a lot of them uh that we have not being able to get through. But uh uh Wednesday night we talked on wash day 7. I want to continue with that this morning. Watch that 7 and uh uh let's read uh Matthew chapter 17 reading from verse one. And after six days, taking Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringing them up into a high mountain apart, and was transfigured &gt;&gt; before them. The seven is always a mystery. After sixth day, the seven he was transfigured before them. Praise the Lord. He was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the sun, and his remnant was white as the light. And behold, there appear unto him Moses and Elias talking with him. Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make three tabernacle, one for they and one for Moses, and one for Elias. While he yet speak, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice out of the cloud which said, "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased, y him." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 17. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 17. Praise the Lord. Re sorry. Revelation chapter 10. N 17. Revelation chapter 10. Revelation chapter 10. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed in the cloud, and the rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the sun and his feet as pillows of fire. and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I want to grab your attention to as we read the scripture this morning, Revelation chapter 10 begins with a conjunction. Verse one is a conjunction and verse two is a conjunction and verse three is a conjunction and verse four. When you get to verse seven, which is the seventh conjunction, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; it changes. It's no long, but it's but. and uh uh and and uh uh uh the English speakers will tell you they are the uh the the conjunction but make an emphasis. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why the conjunction and just connect this statement with that statement. It connects uh uh the nouns, the adverb, the rest. But the the the conjunction, but it makes a contract or uh it makes u uh an exception is different in that way. Either it either brings a contract or an opposing statement or it makes an exception. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to bring your mind to because The seventh is always a mystery. Okay. So in the seventh verse something changes but in the days of the voice of the seven angel when he shall begin to sign the mystery of God shall be finished. Let's bow our heads and pray together. Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray and say, "Oh God, just uh come and help Lord uh your feeble servant this morning. I just ask that Lord God, you will come out of the pages of your word and come and speak to us. Lord, I give you the praise. I give you the glory and honor this morning. Just bless us in your presence now. In Jesus name we pray." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you. Also, uh talked to Sister Mary yesterday. She said she was not going to be in service uh because of uh uh different things happening around her. Praise the Lord. And she asked that we pray for her son, the one who she stayed with. This morning I want to go back like I said uh uh Wednesday night uh after what we spoke about last week and uh talking about the turn the word upside down and we read uh Isaiah chapter uh five and in Isaiah chapter 5 we there with the with the six wars that Isaiah prophesied about you know uh uh addressing the nation Israel and also addressing the word because he's a prophet. Sometimes a prophet message is not just only to the people he's speaking to. Sometimes is to the word which of course we see that with Isaiah because he prophesied about the millennium. He prophesied about the rapture. He prophesied about the coming of the Messiah and all of that. So we see Isaiah was bringing this prophecy to the people. And then in chapter six uh uh the scripture will introduce us to Yuzier his his good friend and and and uh and and relative somehow pass away and Aziah went into the temple. So there we also see that in the temple when he went to pray the Bible said he said woe is me and and uh uh strange enough when I was reading the scripture it never it never uh uh dawn on me on uh uh last Sunday but when I were reading during the week and uh uh I it just dawn on me that if you go back uh there's five world and year is the seventh with a himself in the temple Praise the Lord. And this little statement uh uh brother Brandon made from uh souls in praising uh he's talking about the seals and the trumpets and all of that. And he and and he made this statement where he says the seven is always a mystery. Watch the seven. That's the finish. That was the coming of of the Lord. Heaven was quiet, silent. Nobody move. Praise the Lord. Amen. Okay. Nobody move. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay. So uh uh so then I just I just started dwelling on that uh watch the seven and started going through different different seven you know Jesus talking to the woman at the word you know five husband the one you work with is now your husband there was six and uh then where is the seven he was the seven amen he was the seven there are six city of refuge when you go that I can read in the Old Testament. But Jesus became the seven when he said, "Come unto me all you that labor and heavy laden and I will give you rest." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And uh uh uh I just I just pray that uh what we have to share with you this morning will be a blessing to you. uh because there are there are few things that I want to look at. Like I like I told you uh I spoke some things yet in the past and then uh uh while I was away I spoke on the same subject but in a very different way. So that I want to go into there this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus took his disciples six days after sixth day. After six day which was the seventh he took them up on the mountain. How are you? God bless you. He came back with more beard than before. Oh maybe just a few days I didn't see you. and uh uh 60 and the seven and then here comes the the transfiguration. You know, brother Bannon will call that uh his adoption. Here come his transfiguration. This is up on the mountain. This is up on the mountain. Uh and I'm I'm just really really praying that I won't do an ugly job here this morning. But this is here up on the mountain and he's transfigured before his disciple. The glory of the Lord has come. You know there's a cloud that is upon the mountain and uh and Peter looking at the cloud and says what is good for us to be here is very good for us to be here. But then in the same regard you know he want to build three tabernacle and and God is saying no this is my beloved son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, but what what I want us to look at this morning is that if you go back to Isaiah chapter 6, like we said, uh uh uh on Wednesday night, uh the Bible says uh uh his train filled the temple. His train filled the temple. And uh uh I read to you on Wednesday night if uh the for young people they won't share with us. Revelation chapter 4:3. Now listen, in the year that Uzzia, the king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon his throne high and lifted up. His train filled the temple glory. What? His train. There it is. Angels, beans, his train that follow him. This the train what come behind his train filled the temple and above it stood the saraphins. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now if you study Revelation series you will see where brother Brandon talks about this tree that filled the temple was the lion, the ox, the man and the eagle. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And which of course he says is a chariting. You remember when we did that drama year where we have four person and we lock our hands. &gt;&gt; You remember that? &gt;&gt; And and and one go this way and one go that that way. &gt;&gt; And uh if you don't remember, we can do it again. I still have four guys here. We can we can play it out again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you want us to do it again? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Ah man, you want us to play it again? Okay, we'll do that. I'd be glad to do that for you. Okay, let's uh uh the reason why I love that is because uh even even when I was away, I use it in most of my services. I preach. I think one or two I didn't use it. But uh whenever you whenever that is done, it brings it brings a very different picture. It brings a clear picture. Let me show you why I say it brings a clear picture. Let's go to the book of Ezekiel. Let's go to the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel chapter 1. Ezekiel chapter one, you know the Laudishia church age was the Pentecostal age. So when the so when the when the messenger came, he came to the Pentecostal people. That's the reason why the Pentecostal people uh embraced the message because they were they were experiencing the gift of the Holy Ghost and and and pretty soon the church was drifting from there into organization. So those that were still holding to the manifestation of the Holy Ghost they admire brother Brandon gift even uh God in Peterson that was in this city Minneapolis they they admire brother Brandon gift. So they were always bringing brother Brandham to their meeting you know uh uh but you see the message has come to take us from the Pentecostal age into the bride age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Into the bride age. So uh uh uh uh we have a lot of uh uh uh you know uh uh carryover. I heard a brother said, and I really love that. I said I'm going to I'm going to stick guy on the fifth rate. He said uh he said there are many. There's there's brother Albert Green from Trinidad, an old man. He says he says we have we have uh overcomers and we have people that come over. I said that's a good one because the reason why I said that is because uh there were a lot of carryovers. There were a lot of carryovers. People try to carry holiness over to the message. They try to carry the uh uh uh you know things from the Pentecost age, you know, the way they prayed and all that prayer meeting and just there were just a lot of carryover. But as you get into the opening of the word and you really start to understand what this message is about, you realize that most of the carryover starts to fall out. Amen. Because lot of the carryover they they are just men own impression. [Music] &gt;&gt; I can impress you. You can try to if you if you can impress me but we can't impress God. &gt;&gt; He knows our end from the beginning. He knows the the the length of our strength. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter one. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter one. Is that what I said? &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter one. So Ezekiel chapter 1, let's read verse 6. Now Ezek Ezekiel chapter 1 talks about he talks about the cherubim. Verse four, let's read from verse four. And I look and behold, a whalewind came out of the north, a great cloud, and the fire unfolding itself. His brightness was about it. And out of the midst thereof was uh a color of amber. Out of the midst of the fire also out of the midst thereof came a likeness of four living creatures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Revelation is called four beasts but it's the same here. A likeness a creature a likeness of four living creature. And this was his appearance. They had the likeness of a man and everyone have four faces and everyone have four wings. Now when you read this like this, when you read it like this, it's easy for you to understand that all the living creature individually have four faces. &gt;&gt; Is that not the way you understand it? &gt;&gt; That's the way you understand it. And that's the way every Bible reader will understand it because the man that spoke these things were not yet to really explain what the vision is. And that's the reason why God now will have to send a prophet, an interpreter of the word to be able to get right back there and explain it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh uh Emmanuel, can you put my picture up? Not the cloud, the the the four faces. Okay. Now, so I didn't clean the picture very well. &gt;&gt; There's there's more work I need to do on it now. So, so if you if you see this, this is the man, the lion, the eagle, and the home back there is the ox. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That would be the same thing if if I have four brothers here and we lock arms together. &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; now? So uh uh now you see that is the reason why the drama come on my friend. Come and help me. Come uh yeah you you [Music] Yes. Come on. Come. Come on, Billy. Let me use you for once before you go back. So, you stand right here. Yeah. Take your hand from your pocket, bro. You are angel. Angel don't have a pocket. So, you stand on the side. No. Look, look that way. Yeah. Look that way. Okay. You come close and so you lock your hand with this guy and lock your hands there. Then I lock my hand. &gt;&gt; So you see that's that is the picture that we have right here. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel said each one of them have four faces. No, the four faces is identify with any of the beast because let me let me do it this way now. If uh uh if uh brother Peterson is the ox and you go when he go we all go. &gt;&gt; You see they are not going in separate ways. &gt;&gt; So because it is the ox anointing &gt;&gt; the four is joined with them. &gt;&gt; It's one anointing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. is one anointing. So that is the reason why the ox anointing can be seen. You can have the the the the ox anointing in the age was the dark age, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You as an individual, you can be honor the ox anointing when you are going through trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's an it's an anointing of patience. &gt;&gt; You are under that anointing for that season. But what is happening here is that because God protects the church with the full anointing, you the the ox anointing is back with the rest of the other anointing. &gt;&gt; They don't leave him alone. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now, the reason why I'm saying that because I want to explain what the train is. The train is this all of these lock because they are like that. It's a train. The Bible say his train filled the temple. &gt;&gt; So the angels wings were locked and they were moving. &gt;&gt; In cycle are we together? &gt;&gt; Bless you brothers. Have your seat. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I I love this demonstration. That's my specialty. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's my specialty. I'm telling you, when I when I get in there, I I I it looks like the full anointing just come on me right away. &gt;&gt; And I mean, I'm I feel so anointed. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my specialty. It it it it helped me to bring it out in a way that uh become so clear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so it is not that they have individual four face or one having four faces. Lord at the time the on whatever anointing that they are the four powers the four strength is is is united there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now so so that's that is the train that fills the temple. The train that fills the temple is how this angel locked their wings and because man, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember I this this will be review for for many of you that have heard over the pit here but uh uh you know uh brother Brandon will say right from from uh from Eden when the Bible says God pou cherubim to guide the tree of life &gt;&gt; it was these four anointings. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; He said it traveled with the with the church from Eden. When it gots to revelation, John saw it before the throne. So he said the church in vision, the church has already arrived. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the church came filled. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because in vision, John already saw &gt;&gt; these cherubans before the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the book of Revelation. So the church travel all through the ages and they were protected under these anointings. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every prophet that ever came through the Bible operated under one of these anointing. Jeremiah was called the weeping prophet. He was an ox. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now, so it was it was an anointing that gathered the church and is guiding the church today. &gt;&gt; The church is locked in the middle of these four beasts. No devil can enter. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is the reason why it's a mystical body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church is not your local structure. &gt;&gt; Where you can count and judge one another by your by your your your human mind. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; The church is a mystical body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; One is here, one is there, you know, and and God have his people here and there and and and and in what he's doing. So you see u uh uh we we want to talk about the train. His train filled the temple. You can you can cut this. Put the light on a little bit for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; His train filled the temple. That's where I want to go this morning. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon say his train They are the angels. Those being his train that follow him is the train that fill the temple. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now you look at that word train. If you look at the word train, the word train means border. &gt;&gt; It means border. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And if you look at the word, it also tells you that the word train and and the word the hem of his garment both of them &gt;&gt; comes from the sea. Okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me let me uh uh let's read Numbers chapter 15. This is uh this is the old thing. It's just that I'm trying to I'm trying to kind of uh do a review with you because sometimes you speak on some things that go over the heads of the people. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Numbers chapter 15 when you read verse 38 and 39. Numbers chapter 15 verse 38 and 39. 37. And the Lord spake to Moses, saying, "Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make fringes in the border of their garment." The fringes in the border of their garment is the hem. When you hem your your your clothes, you he have to lose this one because it looks like I'm growing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the the the hand of your of your clothes. So God is telling them here that uh you know they should make fringes in the border of their garment. It must just not be loose. you must make a French throughout their generation and that they put upon the fringes of uh of the border uh a ribbon of blue and she put a blue ribbon. Now you will see that's where as I was as I was studing this that is where the military took their straps that they put here to show rank &gt;&gt; because back there the hem of the garment in the way it was designed show whether this person was a priest or this person was a king. It shows royalty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It shows I mean uh you can know that this person is from a wealthy family because the kind of a fabric they are using to make the hem of their garment is not a cheap fabric. So it shows rank. That's what I want to say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then over time you know uh uh people started using it for for for different design and and and uh and the military use their you know their their stripes. That's what it's called their stripes on their rank. Are we together? &gt;&gt; But God is telling them that they they have to do that all through their generation. Verse 39. It shall be made uh uh uh it shall be unto you for a French that they may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them and that they seek not after their own heart and uh and your own eyes after which ye used to go worry. What does that means now? It was a form of meditation. The people are walking. They must be looking at the hem of their garment, remembering the promises of God, remembering the commandments of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you see, yeah, brother Brandham said there was no commandment in the Bible that says when you touch the hem of his garment, you will be healed. It was not a commmenting. &gt;&gt; Amen. But with with that being seen, we see here in the in the in the scripture that there was a blessing that was attached to it. And what the blessing is that is going to create a meditation for the believer to keep his mind on the promises that your mind will not go worrying. &gt;&gt; You will not just be thinking about unnecessary things. You having something that you are keeping your mind on. David said, "I set the law before me." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So even though it was not a physical com, it was not a physical commandment or a written commandment that if you touch the hem of the garment, you will be healed. But this woman knows that God has put his his his commandment. He has put his word on the borders of their clothes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's inspiration. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When an inspiration get a hold of a person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just like the shim that woman that had the inspiration and she said all is well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was her inspiration. &gt;&gt; Her child is lying dead and cold. But her inspiration when anybody ask me I will say all is well until I get to meet the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the woman with the blood issue also had an inspiration that if I can touch the hem of his garment I know I will be healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now see what happened when David was running away from Saul. He was hiding in the mountain. He was able to sneak into the man of Saul and what he did he caught &gt;&gt; saw garment. You know what he did? He cut the hem of his &gt;&gt; gar. &gt;&gt; So what does that means? When he came he stood on the mountain and he shout to Abna. He says he says he says what what a what a what a defense a weak defense you have. How can you be a captain? I I can have the life of your master in my hands. &gt;&gt; I can even show it to you. But the hem of his clothes. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? &gt;&gt; It means that his covering was destroyed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Ruth went into the field of &gt;&gt; Boas, You know what she did? She took the hem of his garment &gt;&gt; and she covered herself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because she wanted to be redeemed. &gt;&gt; She wanted a covering. &gt;&gt; She said, "I feel naked in the land. I don't have a covering. I need a redeemer. &gt;&gt; I need a man to cover me. Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; My my my [Music] &gt;&gt; brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; So you see that is that is there is a is uh is is is in the scripture. And now the reason why I'm coming to this because uh uh watch that seven is always a mystery. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the part maybe when I share this with you then I can preach what I want to preach if I still have time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now so what what is happening here is that the uh revelation chapter 10 revelation chapter 10 let's go back to revelation chapter 10 verse one. Revelation chapter 10. All saints of God, people of God, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I might not be your favorite preacher. &gt;&gt; Uh maybe my message, you know, you don't connect with it. You know, everybody is designed with certain certain different preachers, but I want to testify this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to testify this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to testify this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse one, "And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as the pillow of fire." This this scripture hit me one day. It hit me one day so hard. And uh you know I share with you when God came down to Moses in the burning bush, she said, "Take off your shoes for I have come down." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and we learned that that that that symbol of taking of the shoes was a was a language of redemption. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because the king's man had to take off his shoes. In the Jewish culture, if he could not redeem the woman, then you take off your shoes. Let the man that is redeeming a woman put on the shoes. &gt;&gt; And that's why we take in our language. You are not in my shoes. If you were only in my shoes, you would know what I'm going through. It's a redemptive language. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here we see that Revelation 10 is identifying this mighted angel that his feet is like what? &gt;&gt; A pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whenever you see the pillar of fire, you have just seen his feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's He's just He has just stepped down. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had just stepped down. The Bible said he says the heaven is the is my throne. The earth is my foottool. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we see there in Houston and and uh uh uh uh uh uh brother FF A F A F A F A F A F A F A F A F A F A FB bus defending uh uh uh divine healing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Divine healing and Dr. Bess is challenging divine healing that there's nothing like divine healing and and all of that. And then we we we realize here that uh uh uh you know the argument goes on and uh brother FFB bus challenging with the redemptive names. You know if they if they relate to Jesus Christ he could not defend that he just going all over the place and we see that God I mean that brother Brandon comes out. He called brother Brandis to the pulpit. And the way that I think about it then is that you know God taking a picture stepping down. &gt;&gt; God stepping down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as he's coming down the the the the the flash of the camera grab his foot because his feet is like a pillow of fire. Now, but if if you look into that also, you will see that Revelation 10:E1 give us a complete description of this angel. It kind of it it just bring his entire identity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It tells it tells us of a cloud, you know, uh uh uh around his hair. It tells of a of his face and it tells of his feet. So is a is a complete identity of this mighty angel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now so uh uh and and and in our day and age that you see that uh uh of of one of the thing that is so argued and fuss about. I will get into my message. Uh Emmanuel put my my picture up of the cloud. Now remember now remember that his train No, not that one. The next one. Yes. Now remember now that his train that filled the temple, that train that filled the temple was the blending of the angels wings. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like in a physical uh uh uh in a physical demonstration, we lock our hands together to create a a cycle in the middle. When you when you go back and read Ezekiel and and and and Revelation, you you realize that uh uh uh uh that that description that Isaiah gave that his train filled the temple is the locking of the angel's wings. So these clouds that were that were formed there in Arizona where the angels spreading their wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. &gt;&gt; Seven angels spreading their wings. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so just like how over in the Old Testament, praise the Lord. Just like how over in the Old Testament uh uh uh uh they were supposed to keep uh uh the commandment on the Frenches of their gathering. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was a sign of a believer being covered by the word of God. &gt;&gt; It was a sign of the believer being covered by the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we we see here that uh that that that that in our day in our age uh when when those seven angels came down on the mountain, it was uh you know like some Robert B say I never never really put all of these things together this morning because I was only dwelling on this so I can be able to run with what I want to preach this morning. And uh it was it was it was at a place where he says you know what uh he says uh uh he was taking a picture with us in a sense that our representation the bride representation just like how uh uh uh uh Ruth had to go on the the the the border of uh uh Bo's garment. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the same where this these these angels come spreading their wings and and as their train filled the heavens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the locking of their wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The train that filled the temple bar said and then just above it were the saraphins. &gt;&gt; You read through the message. He said that over and over. I was just looking at few of that uh uh just before uh yeah in uh unchanging God he said I don't have that up there so don't look for it when when he seen the the the train of the Lord I saw angels flying through the building with wings over their face and and and wings over their feet uh uh uh and flying with two wings crying holy holy unto the Lord you know so every time he he talked talks about this associating with what what uh Isaiah saw. He identified that a word the angels the angels are the trains that fill his temple. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So watch that. Seven is always a mystery. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This is where I want to go this morning. 2 Samuel chapter 6. 2 Samuel chapter 6. I would tell you saints that uh uh this work of redemption. The Bible says there was no man worthy, Amen, to take the book or to even look upon the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no man worthy to take the book or to look upon the book as I mean 2 Samuel chapter 6. 2 Samuel chapter 6. And this uh 2 Samuel chapter 6 will be uh addressing David bringing back the ark of the covenant. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's read from verse 12. 2 Samuel chapter 6 reading from verse 12. &gt;&gt; Verse 11. And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obedom. They gave Tai three months and the Lord blessed Obi Edom and all his household. And it was told David, saying, "The Lord have blessed the house of O Edom and all that pertain unto him because of the ark of God." So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obedon into the city of David with gladness. You got to pay attention now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because the ark represent the word. Amen. He's going to bring the ark of the of the Lord not with sadness. He's going to bring the ark of the Lord with gladness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. The joy of the Lord is my strength. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The word comes forth with gladness. &gt;&gt; And if the word comes forth with gladness, you must also receive it with gladness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. doing God a service have just passed. &gt;&gt; At first, he was doing God a service out of the word of God. It caused the life of a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. David retreated. He went and consulted the prophet. He went to find out from the prophet how this thing supposed to be done. The prophet instructed him. He's not coming back with sadness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's not coming back dwelling on his defeat. He's not coming back and say, "Ah, of course, the life of a man. Oh, he already get the word of God. He having an instruction from the prophet of God. Now he's coming with gladness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says and and and and and he went and brought the ark of God from the house of O Eden into the city of David. And it and and uh with gladness. And it was so that when they that bear the act of the Lord had gone six pace. &gt;&gt; Watch the seven now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch the seven now. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Watch the seven now. You see because this these are the things that God is doing with our life. People just think that you have to get a menu how you read in the morning you know how and and and it is just all man driven. No this whole thing about our redemption is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's supernatural. He's the one that begin the work. That's why he's called the author and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and David got the man. The Bible says here at first he went and put the ark on a card. &gt;&gt; You know, he was learning from uh from from the Philistines &gt;&gt; because they send the ark back with a card. He was copying from the denominations. And that's what the church try to do today. We copy from the denominations. You know, they can do like this. Their services is like this. We must go to the prophet. &gt;&gt; We must get a word of God. Amen. because it is not pleasing you. &gt;&gt; It's not pleasing you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's the one that we have to please. &gt;&gt; He's the one that we bring praise and worship to. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what? You know how much problem I will have if I try to please everybody. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he went back and Nathan instructed him that you have to get men that you know that that are ordained of God and they must take the ark of the Lord on their shoulder. No more C. Now David followed the prophet here. He's coming back. And the Bible says here that uh after the men that were ordained to carry the ark, after they have took six, &gt;&gt; one, &gt;&gt; two, three, four, five, &gt;&gt; six, he broke the other. Watch. See what happened &gt;&gt; after the talk six and and and it was so verse 13 that when they that bear the ark of the Lord has gone six spaces he sacrifining and fatling. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And David danced before the Lord with all of his might. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now follow me now in a little bit. You will see what I'm going to hear. And and he danced before the Lord with all of his might. And David was g with a leaning epher. And that was something that the priest had to work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So David was king and priest. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But you see, he was gathered with the leaning epher. Let me wear my coat on the wrong side. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But he was not walking like a Levitical priest. &gt;&gt; He had the epher, but this man was dancing with the epher. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says, "And he danced before the Lord with all of his might, and David was gi and Epher." So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord, with shouting and with sounds of trumpet. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He brought all all of that with shouting and sounds of trumpet. Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'm kind of looking for something here because uh uh where do I have it? Okay. Yeah. Stay in the reading. Now uh uh and as the ark of as the ark of the Lord came into the city uh uh Michelle saw daughter looked through the window and saw the king leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in in uh her heart. And they brought the ark of the Lord and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that David pitch for it. Now, so this is where the tabernacle of David was dedicated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bringing back of the ark, &gt;&gt; which is the word of the Lord, the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; David was bringing back the ark. But before he brought back the ark, he has already built a tabernacle. &gt;&gt; He was not taking the ark back to that old temple &gt;&gt; of sadness and gloom. &gt;&gt; No, he was not carrying it back to Jerusalem of sadness and gloom. So even the priests that were carrying the tabernacle, they were all they were all shocked &gt;&gt; because this man is wearing an epher. When you put that epher on as a high priest, the Bible say you got to wash your steps &gt;&gt; as you going into the holiness of holy &gt;&gt; because one misstep &gt;&gt; you will drop and die. &gt;&gt; But David not even knowing whether it's left and right. He's dancing all over the place. &gt;&gt; He's wearing the high he wearing the high priest ea. &gt;&gt; So he's he's changing the order. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because after the six is a mystery. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The the tabernacle of David has been birthed in the midst of the people. &gt;&gt; It changed the order. &gt;&gt; You see, when the woman at the word met the seven men, &gt;&gt; what happened? It changed her order. The Bible say she ran into the street. The thing that she couldn't do when she were with the six men, now when she met the seven men, she can do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just when it took six steps &gt;&gt; right there, David, &gt;&gt; stop there. Let's stop right here. &gt;&gt; This is a new day. &gt;&gt; This is a new message. &gt;&gt; This is not your old denomination. &gt;&gt; No. This is a new message. &gt;&gt; This is a new day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the tabernacle of David was dedicated. He dedicated the tabernacle by breaking the ark of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch, watch and see what happened here. I love this. &gt;&gt; I love it. See what happened. Let's let's read a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we just read and then we close and then the next day we preach. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in and uh verse 17 and the brother act of the Lord and set it in the place in the midst of the tabernacle that David has pitched for it. And David offer burnt offering and peace offering before the Lord. And as soon as David has made an end of offering, offering and peace offering, burnt offering and peace offering, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he dw among the people even among the whole multitude as well to the women as men. Now let me explain this for you so you will really understand what is happening here. Because in the Levitical temple, &gt;&gt; the people were separated. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The people stopped in the altar court. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was only the priest that came in the inner court. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the high priest goes in the holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In this tabernacle that David built, there is no inner. There is no altar. It's open for everybody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There is no seat for women. There is no seat for men. It's open for everybody. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in the tabernacle of David, he's giving the people a direct access. &gt;&gt; Direct access to the presence of God. You don't have to go through a mother or a father or a bishop or a priest. You have the act of God right there. You can go there and get an answer from God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he made an offering. That's what they would do in the altar court. &gt;&gt; Then the people in the holiest of holies will have to sit back and wait. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Call down for the people we have to the I mean they will have to stay there after the after the sacrifice is made. You have to stay there and wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the priest will be the one that will go into the holy place. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the altar called my mind is going 10,000 different ways this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In in in the in in the in the Levitical priesthood, the the the the altar of burnt offering was right in the altar. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and uh and and and the sacrifice was made there. The high priest go he take the arches of the sacrifice he put it in the water and create a water of separation and then he put a house up there and then he sprinkle it on the people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then the rest of the services is done in the inner call while the people stay out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't see what is done in the inner call. You stay out. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But in this tabernacle of David, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; When the when the priest came uh six feet, six step, &gt;&gt; David say it is the end. &gt;&gt; He says stop right here. It is the end of the Levitical priesthood. &gt;&gt; It is the end of the services of men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seven, you are stepping right into God's presence. &gt;&gt; You don't need a pope to carry you there. You don't need a bishop. You have to go there by yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; And right there, he did the burnt offering right there. Everything that they would do in the altar call and the inner court, he did it right there before the people. &gt;&gt; All the three calls became one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no trinity now. There was no father, son, holy ghost. The name has been revealed. All has become one &gt;&gt; right there before the people. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The angels bow before him. &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth adore him. Right. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the the the the tabernacle of David was birthed right there. The tabernacle of David was established by the return of the word. The return of the ark. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you see that's the reason why we put our feelings and our ideas. They must all be behind the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because that's what brings us into the presence of God. When God came down in in in Eden and he was reconciling Adam back, he was not uh having, you know, the sheep skin came behind him and trying to hide it from Adam. No, man would never come in the presence of God until they come through the blood. &gt;&gt; So, he had to have that that that lamb before him and saying, "Adam, Adam, where are you?" The first thing you see is the blood. Amen. The first thing you see if uh if Christianity will ever mean anything to you, the first thing you see is not a church. The first thing you see is not a prophet. The first thing you see is Calvary. &gt;&gt; Is if Calvary has not reached to your heart. You are just making another religion. You are just a religious person. The first thing we see is the lamb that died for our sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the first thing that he show Adam and Eve. That is the thing that matters &gt;&gt; because that's the thing that brings you back into fellowship. That's the thing that reconcile you with God. &gt;&gt; It's not what church you go, what your pastor name, how many members you have. It does not reconcile you with God. The thing that reconcile you with God is the bleeding word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So that was the first thing, the return of the word, the act. Amen. When the word came, then that was when praise and worship followed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So praise and worship do not dictate to the word. &gt;&gt; It's the word that dictate how we worship. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Well, because we are worshiping the word. &gt;&gt; Christ is the word. &gt;&gt; So he dictates how we worship. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So we see here David when he brought the eye he got into prison worship you know h prison worship was introduced vancing before the lord David took deity &gt;&gt; above his dignity &gt;&gt; he took the deity of God &gt;&gt; the god that led our fathers The God that told Abraham to build this ark &gt;&gt; and that the commandment should be laid in it. He took the word of God above his dignity. &gt;&gt; When her wife was thinking that she's the type of the church, that's why the church is dead today. &gt;&gt; That's why the church is barren today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When she thought that, well, yeah, you know, he's a he's he's a man. He you're supposed to know that as a king there's a way you have to behave. That's the way. And we become so particular about ourself, our personalities and and what have you. David talk the deity of God. He talk the returning of God's presence back in the midst of the people. He took that above his dignity. &gt;&gt; What I'm a king. He says he says I remember you took me from the ship court. &gt;&gt; You took me from the ship court &gt;&gt; when I never had a name. I never knew anything. &gt;&gt; My life was a waste. You took me and the God that have taken us. Now we take our dignity. We become so proud and we trashing his name &gt;&gt; because we think we have achieved. We have arrived. &gt;&gt; David told the deity of God. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God. What a God he is. &gt;&gt; He told his wife, "You never see nothing. &gt;&gt; You thought I was You thought I was messing around. You have not seen nothing. I'm not going back to that old dare tabernacle. No, I'm coming toward the presence of God where I have the liberty to worship God. The liberty to jump, to shout, to praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He took his his uh h the deity of God. What a mighty God he is. &gt;&gt; That we will compare ourselves to him to even to even think that we can ask him question. Who are you? &gt;&gt; Who are you to think that you can even question him? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; After six pieces, the seven was a mystery. The tabernacle of David was born. The tabernacle that would come to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in the old tabernacle only Jews could go there. &gt;&gt; But in this tabernacle of David, it was both Jews and Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why God promised, "I will rebuild the tabernacle of David." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we say we we have the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You say that you have seen the ark of God in this day. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You stay in that old Leviticus tabernacle. If you are seeing the act of God in this day, it will affect your worship. It will affect your attitude in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why should you matter what somebody would think if you want to express yourself to God? Express yourself anyhow. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; The tabernacle of David was born. Listen to what Bram will say right here in uh unveiling of God. He says, "Behold the old tabernacle in the veil." What was back behind the veil? We know the old old tabernacle had a veil. The presence of God was hid from the people. You are worshiping a God. You can't see it. &gt;&gt; He just all in your mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are worshiping a God that we have created for ourself. is behind the veil. But in this tabernacle of David, there is no veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No veil. It's a It's an open tent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come unto me all you that labor and have heavy laden. &gt;&gt; And I will give you rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Behold the old temple in the veil. What was back behind there? What was what was Jehovah? What was he back there? What was the veil hiding? Oh, hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What was the veil hiding? It was hiding the word. &gt;&gt; The veil the old badger skin was hiding hiding the word to their eyes natural behind there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see when when even when our Lord Jesus came, the only time the Bible recorded that he went to the temple, he went right toward the the the seat that was kept for the Messiah. Luke chapter 4 because they kept that seat for the Messiah. That when the Messiah come, he went right to that seat. That's where the Bible say he took the book and he ran from where Isaiah said the spirit of the Lord God is upon me. He closed the book, gave it to the high priest and he sat down in that seat. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He never went to the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the tabernacle was hiding God from the people &gt;&gt; and he was here to reveal God to the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why he did not he didn't it didn't matter to him whether he met them on the beach, whether he called Zakius from the tree, whether he stood in a boat to preach. He was to he was to declare God to the people, &gt;&gt; not bring people to a house like the door &gt;&gt; and get certain seat to certain people &gt;&gt; and they think they are privileged. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whenever he went to the to to their tabernacle, he was he was always out of order. &gt;&gt; The last time he show Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That every time he show up to their to their temple, he will always out of order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He show up with a whip. He's kicking all the table and he's whipping the people out of the place. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's saying you you are hiding God from the people. He's a living God. He's not a God you can box in the corner. He's not a God you can keep behind tradition. He's a living God living among his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's not a God only for Sunday morning. He's a God for Monday morning. He's a God for Tuesday in the street. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just a God where we wear our best suit and put on our best behavior. He's a God even when we are in our worst moment, he's still a living God that laid among his people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My my my my old bad skin was hiding hiding the word to their eyes. naturally behind there also was the shortbread and uh and and you you just go down and read read down a little bit here. The Bible says see what what David would do here. This this man David, this man David, he's a radical. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's a radical. And I believe that's why God is looking for men and women that are just radical. &gt;&gt; Radical to the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's a radical. See what he did here. The Bible says and as soon as David has made an end of offering the burn offering and the peace offering he blessed the people in the name of the Lord and uh he dw among the people. He were not in some kind of special corner or behind say y'all wait for me yeah let me go. No no no he dw among the people. &gt;&gt; It was different. &gt;&gt; No curtains. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He dwelt among the people. He dwelt among all the people even among the whole multitude as well as the women as it was it was important for them to put it here as the women as the men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To everyone a cake of bread. &gt;&gt; This is the short bread. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's supposed to be eaten only by the priest. &gt;&gt; That's right. This is the short bread that's supposed to be. His first day of service, David is doing communion. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; His first service is having dedicating the church. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; At the same time, he's doing communion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Everything is happening right there and then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's the tabernacle of David. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the tabernacle of David. That's the reason why the the the the the the church at the beginning the Bible says they went from house to house b breaking bread. Every service they met was a communion. &gt;&gt; All this thing where you where we have to go and prepare ourself or I I need to wash my life or I need to consecrate myself and every service they met if they were meeting five days in a week they were having communion every day. &gt;&gt; Don't you see that the Catholic church took that? Yes. &gt;&gt; Every time they meet &gt;&gt; in their Catholic with their Catholic do, they still have communion. Where they took it from? From the early church. &gt;&gt; And now we must make it on first Sunday &gt;&gt; or choir Saturday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is this is not first Sunday. Why are we having communion? And even as message people, we are dragging this dogma with us. Whether it's an evening service, whether it's a it's a Wednesday service, every service is good for communion. &gt;&gt; Because what is the communion? The breaking of the word. &gt;&gt; It's the communion. It's the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we have we have to announce communion to you. Next month we are taking communion. So, please consecrate yourself fast as you know clean your life. Now I you should come to service evening Wednesday evening service and you see a communion sitting down here it must not shock you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; His first service. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's not even asking the people when you get converted. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Who are your pastor when you got baptized? &gt;&gt; He's not even asking them. sit in the seat of comfort and we are just examining people live. Look at this other one going for the communion. Look at this other one. We'll preach another time. Let me just read. &gt;&gt; And he dwared among all the people, even among all the whole multitude of Israel, as well as women as men, to everyone a cake and a good piece of flesh and flaggings of wine. &gt;&gt; So all the people departed, everyone to his house. He did a communion right at the end of the service. &gt;&gt; After the worship has gone, the trumpets were blown. &gt;&gt; The praise rang. &gt;&gt; The people shouted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They expressed themselves. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God we say. What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. It's always a mystery. &gt;&gt; When God bring you when God breath you into your seven, &gt;&gt; all this statchiness and and and stubbornness that we think we are, &gt;&gt; wait and wait and see. Let the uh let let he bring you to that place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was it was just it was just seasonal. Like I said Wednesday, that is not something it's not something that you calculate him by your human mind. No, you just follow the Lord. &gt;&gt; These men were following the Lord. They were under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Not even knowing these things. &gt;&gt; They never even had an idea that in God's mind, seven was very special to him. They never had it. &gt;&gt; They were just doing what they were doing, earnestly serving God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he brought them into that place. He broke them into that place. &gt;&gt; So serving God is sweet. &gt;&gt; It's very sweet. I mean I mean having a relationship &gt;&gt; when you having a relationship where you know that this God is your buddy. He's there. He has your back. &gt;&gt; Not looking over your shoulder who watching who they say what they think. It does not bother me &gt;&gt; by his grace. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I will I'll ever be grateful to this church of having me your pastor send me out of that door. I'll be on the next flight. &gt;&gt; I'll be on the next flight down to Zambia for the revival or I'll be I will be gone. Amen. I just need to give my wife a kiss. She will take care of the children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Are we together? &gt;&gt; You know, I was I was I was just I was sharing there just something uh uh in our little fellowship yesterday, brother Brown, talking about uh uh uh the Holy Ghost. What is the Holy Ghost? You know, and then he's praying right there at the beginning of of what is the Holy Ghost. He says uh he says oh Lord we have the privilege to be here you know to uh uh to bring the people to the kingdom. He said all to take the kingdom to the people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In a message in his presence when he talk about Isaiah he says what what was doing when those angels came down and pick him up into that constellation took a code of fire and sanctify his mouth. He said he was taking the presence of God to the people. That's what the Holy Ghost is. That's what the message of the hour is. &gt;&gt; Not some kind of a doctrine where we stick on our chest. We are message believer. It's taking the presence of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; God must birth you into death. &gt;&gt; You can't impersonate it. You disgrace yourself. &gt;&gt; He must birth you into death. &gt;&gt; They wait upon the Lord. to renew their strength. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery. It's always a mystery. From the first day, God worked. He said it was good. The second day, the tear, the fourth, the fifth. The sixth day, the seven was a mystery. The Bible say he rested. &gt;&gt; It was a mystery. How did he rest? Where did he rest? Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was not renting h comfort in hotel &gt;&gt; or putting a mat under the man under a tree. &gt;&gt; He was resting in a man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was taking rest in a man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the reason why Adam could speak gave those things the name. Exactly what? Because God was resting in him. That's why the Holy Ghost is called our rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch the sermon is always a mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It take you beyond your church knowledge, &gt;&gt; your religious knowledge. &gt;&gt; Everything you have kept and you you've been believing that is right. When you get in the seven, &gt;&gt; when you get in the seven, &gt;&gt; amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You became you become like a child. You cry like Isaiah, "Woe is me. &gt;&gt; I'm undone. &gt;&gt; I'm a man of unclean lips. This is a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; This is a man that had the gift of vision." &gt;&gt; But yet when he brought when he broke into that seven, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm unworthy. &gt;&gt; I'm a man of unclean lips." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not a Bible school. &gt;&gt; This is not intellectual speech. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; All we're trying to do create an atmosphere. Let God Let God take his curt &gt;&gt; and cover us. &gt;&gt; Let he take his curt and cover us. Let that cloud of glory come and win in this building. &gt;&gt; It will change your life. It will heal your body. &gt;&gt; It will deliver you from whatever you are struggling. Now, how many days you prayed and how many practice, let that presence of God just sweep over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll change your life. You never be the same. You never see things the same. You never think things the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It will change this tabernacle, this assembly. We will now start having church. &gt;&gt; We'll stop playing church. Let that presence of God just come and sweet. That's all we are doing. Just creating atmosphere. We are saying come Lord Jesus. That's what I'm saying this morning. Come Lord Jesus. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let his tree fill the temple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let his tree fill the temple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will change your life. It will heal your sickness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. It's coming for you. &gt;&gt; It will pick you up one of these days. &gt;&gt; It will pick you up in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll pick you up one of these days. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come. I finished reading the scripture. I preach another day. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just let's just let me read this and then that we pray from the message. The power of God. Brother Brandham says, "I'm so sorry I kept you late." And I can say the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so sorry I'm always keeping you late. He says, "Oh, I love him just to think we are living in the presence of the king." When we come into that seventh, we are living in the presence of the king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Across the river where the glory devil fell, &gt;&gt; where the shakana glory of God keeps alive. It keeps from contam contaminating keeps from indulging in the word and is is set aside the presence of God that will keep you. It will keep you. There's a presence that keep you and keep your mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. What do you think keeping all our young people in this kind of a polluted adulterous age that we are &gt;&gt; on all the advertisements a sex spirit all over the place. What is keeping you young people &gt;&gt; is this presence of the shakana glory &gt;&gt; that is the only thing that can keep you from the immorality of this word. When people people are dragged by the desire of drinking, smoking, adultery, h fornication, they are dragged like a chain that is dragging them. But what is keeping you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is because you have allowed him to put his cur over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have come under the borders of his garment. &gt;&gt; Yes. That cloud of glory has sweep over you. That's the thing that is keeping you. If you don't have that, there is no religious practice you can practice &gt;&gt; that will keep you in this hour. &gt;&gt; We are not just going from month to month, going from year to year. You are a human. You have a desire but you have been kept. You have been kept. We cross the river veil where the glory never fail. Where the glory of God keeps alive, keep from contaminating. It keeps from indulging in the word is set aside. is sanctify the believers taking all the things of the word away. What is doing it is not your religious practice is because you are constantly coming under the word and every time you come he cover you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] taking all the things of the world, all the doubts and the darkness in our minds, putting a pure heart, God writing his Lord one time and putting it on a table on the ark and today the man living in the shakana glory honor the mercy seat God writing his Lord upon his heart that is the thing that preserve us. That is the thing that keep us. [Music] That is the thing that is breaking the internet habit from us because you are kept by his presence. [Music] [Music] Oh yeah, we have we have desires.
