I'll give him that eternal life come from the Greek word and you look at this going which moves it through you and then quicken there even there my hello how can you say that that Spirit dwells in you know you've done everything that you thought was right here's your evidence where you got it on if the spirit that was in crisis in you it also quick add you to the word or he is the word in the contract quickens you away from the word then it isn't the Spirit of Christ what you done until that moves you in the word my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word every word I was total after the knee my old mother is gone now and she was a very odd woman and she's there no engine and she was off but in there she was a person who didn't dream but all things she only had four five dreams all her life but every time she dreamed a dream it was true she had a dream it was true I remember one time how first started preaching many years ago we live in up hill in the road right about preaching of the church she dreamed a dream that I was standing here by the side of a three steps and I was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the highway and on the highways a little pearly like white line going into thee the doors of heaven to the thirteen that pearl had been stretched out to the top of these steps if that ain't my message exactly today justification of sanctity and I would think that a person has to come Bobby three steps to be able to walk the highway and said that there was a lady come on now you know what kind of shoes people wore 35 years ago well as a lady come by have a great big pair of the underwear this funky-looking and she'd come by and awesome wingman sister you can't walk that highway then yeah I think you can't eat it and she said Christmas at all thinking is a man man don't be I'll show you I can be justified thank you fighting till what the Holy Ghost and still walking and she I just let her go could do more bad I couldn't stop her and she jumped up on the highway to the fact that sister say yeah told you she started running up and she you know what the Bible says in Isaiah chapter that it has outstretched neck they have treated picked over mincing as it has two extra rinsing as we go making it tinkling with their heels the daughters of Zion and the leg thing and she started up that highway just as hard as she could run and edge wallet roll got an errand here she started really missing I guess and off she went mother said the harvest screams I heard my well that woman falling into those flames and smoke going down down I get the doctor around 30 she just obeyed everything but one word the everything but one word sure then it costs to women can be saved sanctified until what the Holy Ghost can then save and some mansion I live a bread alone but by every word they see and she fails it as I said see she went on all right but see she fail to listen come on what was ahead and he's wrote the gospel by the disciples fossils and doctrine of the apostles and prophets and so forth and they won't listen power discs Whitney power is going bringing the word the mine that was in Christ was in using I'm trying to show you that you when you raised what God raised Jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also quickens your life with him you are now quickly although bands you or butter attribute in his thoughts but God had saw all in him at the finish this when God looked down upon the body the spirit left into the garden get sent me he had to die man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was gone God an ordered that flesh which was human flesh and he didn't appear when at first God he's never died that got his head think he'll gone but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there when you think God had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of crime he saw both male and female it was all ravine of that one body think they are worse same same word the same word spoke of the crew speak to the bride well how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised Eddie and the groom come and he wouldn't be the belly but what he did everything even to proven it by raising himself up from the dead after it then don't accrue as a bride have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she'd be in these nice things though she asked to return to malice aforethought GSB manifested by questions the days of Sodom not the world after he just exactly I could eat into these things up perfect identification of the world God made no answer for Francis I know I'm keeping you a long time 16 minutes just those inner but maybe I get super then but notice lookie here what a perfect thing it is I don't know what to see against me look notice it but God or saw the bride in the groom hallelujah see to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her Adam don't know what he was doing he didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife see and Jesus took his wife's place and it came sin for her remember he became you he stirred your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his way what a love what a fellowship how can we do not how can we do anything but loving friends to stay on ours but let's move on right the Pentecostal experience today and the coming of the Holy Ghost in this place jesus promised it's like the abstract to a title see now you can get a title sure you can get a title to a place but that still don't state yours no sir somebody weighed that current it come in and put a claim but when you get an abstract that shows that everything is ever against it it struck off coming back from the foundation is that right and what a man has said that he believes the word and they when the Holy Spirit come it is the abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have it attracted every bit of that brought you and everything call it blown the aspect when the Holy Ghost comes up all this tyranny the foundation of the world and put a name on the book of life but was born to a man and woman and subject to standing guilty of sin receives a deed so when the Holy Ghost comes it was the abstract everything against me one of my mother done it my father done it my grandmother don't like a little epilepsy child bring forth either so they come to you from the grandparents say F what if she fell down I hold the job out that but when the abstract has come it's knitted everything Christ from the dead I have a abstract deep that I'm sorry a funny with the attack of the Holy Ghost making that body of words it off just a separate
