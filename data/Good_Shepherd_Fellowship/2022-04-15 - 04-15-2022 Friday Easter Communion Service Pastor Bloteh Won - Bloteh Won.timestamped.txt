[34:05] we
[34:08] we can come
[34:11] into his presence
[34:16] through
[34:17] [Music]
[34:18] the you just think about this tonight
[34:22] think about this tonight
[34:24] you and myself we can have such an asset
[34:27] tonight
[34:28] [Music]
[34:30] and the jews the people that were giving
[34:32] the torah they were giving the
[34:34] commandment
[34:37] do you know why the jews
[34:40] are so lacking in this hour because they
[34:42] don't have a temple
[34:45] they cannot make sacrifices
[34:50] until their temple is restored
[34:53] until they can be able to get
[34:55] a a a white offer
[34:57] [Music]
[35:00] to be able once again to for the priest
[35:03] to lay his hands upon the
[35:06] red heifer
[35:08] confess the scene in the scene of the
[35:10] people
[35:11] until they can have a temple
[35:16] they cannot have worship
[35:18] [Music]
[35:21] they cannot have worship everything the
[35:23] jews have is in the past
[35:26] they can only imagine what it was
[35:29] because they do not have a temple
[35:32] there is no without blood there is no
[35:34] remission
[35:35] [Music]
[35:39] and you ever say you and myself we can
[35:41] come tonight
[35:42] walk through those doors
[35:47] and by faith that god's word has created
[35:50] in our heart
[35:51] [Music]
[35:54] we can be able to live for our eyes and
[35:56] live for our and and look
[35:59] up onto the hills
[36:02] we can look up onto the hills
[36:05] [Music]
[36:09] they were there the lamb of god
[36:15] stood in our place one man
[36:19] one sacrifice for all
[36:22] do you know what it would have mean if
[36:24] the jews have one sacrifice if they
[36:27] never had to come continuously
[36:34] but you and myself we have one sacrifice
[36:37] for all
[36:43] and it took almighty god
[36:49] to leave
[36:50] his place
[36:51] of deity
[36:54] and put on a road of flesh
[37:00] and step down
[37:03] step down by the way of a seed of a
[37:06] woman
[37:08] [Music]
[37:11] to bring us such a gift
[37:14] you cannot have true worship
[37:17] you cannot have that's the reason why
[37:19] god could not accept every worship i i i
[37:23] mean king worship
[37:25] because it was with our blood
[37:27] right from the beginning you can never
[37:30] have the right approach to god
[37:33] with other blood
[37:38] i see why jesus said the father seeketh
[37:41] them that will worship him in spirit and
[37:43] truth
[37:50] because he knew that he would bring that
[37:51] sacrifice he knew the purpose for the
[37:54] reason why he was born he knew the
[37:57] purpose
[37:58] [Music]
[37:59] and how can we come here tonight
[38:02] just to come and play church
[38:05] or just for another religious ceremony
[38:08] [Music]
[38:13] when by faith tonight we can enter into
[38:15] god's presence
[38:17] [Music]
[38:25] the field has been reigned from top to
[38:27] bottom
[38:28] almighty god himself did it
[38:31] so all of his children
[38:34] all of his children
[38:37] you don't have to come through
[38:39] a pastor
[38:42] or a deacon you don't have to even come
[38:44] through your parents you don't have to
[38:46] come through your husband or your wife

[1:05:47] i actually wanted this this friday night
[1:05:49] to just be a prayer meeting you know
[1:05:51] where we were just poured our heart you
[1:05:53] know uh that's one of the thing of uh
[1:05:56] of uh you know
[1:05:58] of uh uh
[1:06:01] the week of the crucification you know
[1:06:04] that is uh
[1:06:05] that is spoken
[1:06:07] little about
[1:06:10] praise the lord
[1:06:11] that's one of the things of the night of
[1:06:13] the crucification that is spoken a
[1:06:15] little about uh this week i was
[1:06:17] listening to brother branham the creator
[1:06:19] of sin and the penalty
[1:06:21] that he talked to to raise sin out of
[1:06:23] our life because there were some things
[1:06:25] i was thinking about
[1:06:28] as as we were praying through the
[1:06:30] weekend
[1:06:31] and you know just
[1:06:33] thinking about the easter week weekend
[1:06:36] uh you know i was thinking about
[1:06:37] different things i was thinking about
[1:06:39] how
[1:06:40] god uh prophesied in the life of rebecca
[1:06:44] i mean richard that
[1:06:46] that
[1:06:49] you know the wife of jacob
[1:06:51] uh how he prophesied in the life of
[1:06:54] rachel you know the bible says there the
[1:06:57] rachel weeping for her children and she
[1:06:59] will not be comforted we know that so
[1:07:01] that's a scripture it's a prophecy that
[1:07:03] hangs over israel but then we also know
[1:07:06] it has a spiritual application to the
[1:07:08] church
[1:07:09] and uh
[1:07:11] you know in in the bible you know uh
[1:07:15] jeremiah said that prophecy but uh we
[1:07:18] see when when you go back to genesis and
[1:07:20] you look in the life of uh uh of richard
[1:07:24] and you come to that place we we spoke
[1:07:26] we spoke on a year uh she was coming
[1:07:29] right to beth to him not too far from
[1:07:31] death to him that's where she she got
[1:07:33] into labor pains
[1:07:35] and then uh
[1:07:36] uh right around that time also
[1:07:39] uh you know uh uh the bible says her
[1:07:42] pain was so heavy on her
[1:07:45] and uh uh uh
[1:07:47] and
[1:07:48] there she uh i gave birth to benjamin
[1:07:52] you know with with the pain and
[1:07:53] everything that she had to deal with
[1:07:56] she gave a birth benjamin
[1:07:59] and she's she called him
[1:08:02] bennune you know meaning the son of my
[1:08:04] sorrow
[1:08:05] and and and
[1:08:08] uh i mean that was what she cried out in
[1:08:11] her birth pain
[1:08:13] and uh she said the son of a sorrow but
[1:08:15] you realize that when the same baby was
[1:08:18] placed in the hands of
[1:08:19] of of jacob he called him benjamin
[1:08:23] the son of my right hand
[1:08:25] so you see right there god
[1:08:28] play out a drama
[1:08:31] how he would how god himself would come
[1:08:34] and become the man of sorrow
[1:08:37] to become the man sitting on the right
[1:08:40] hand side of god
[1:08:44] praise the lord
[1:08:45] amen
[1:08:47] everything that rachel was going through
[1:08:49] in her own body
[1:08:51] and the pains that she was dealing with
[1:08:53] and and the
[1:08:55] uh
[1:08:56] the heartbreaks that she had
[1:08:59] after she had waited for children many
[1:09:01] years she had one son and now the law
[1:09:04] had visited her with another boy and and
[1:09:07] and everything all the mixed feelings
[1:09:10] all the the tears and everything
[1:09:13] god
[1:09:14] hanged that
[1:09:16] woman's life into prophecy
[1:09:22] that moment of her life god hangs it
[1:09:25] into prophecy and that's what the
[1:09:27] prophet jeremiah looked at when he said
[1:09:30] rachel weeping for her children
[1:09:32] and she will not be comforted
[1:09:35] to show
[1:09:36] the the the amount of sorrow that will
[1:09:39] follow the jews and and the amount of
[1:09:41] sorrow that will follow the people that
[1:09:44] will identify themselves with jesus
[1:09:46] christ
[1:09:50] before we can sit on his throne and
[1:09:52] reign with him
[1:09:54] we must be
[1:09:56] a man of sorrow
[1:09:58] the bible says he was a man of sorrow
[1:10:01] acquainted with grief
[1:10:07] praise the lord
[1:10:10] and in jesus
[1:10:12] afflict life in his ethnic ministry
[1:10:16] the place where he identified
[1:10:19] where he actually identified and and and
[1:10:23] manifested it i mean there are many
[1:10:25] times even even from just a boy you know
[1:10:28] they gave him all sorts of name how he
[1:10:31] was an illegitimate child you know uh uh
[1:10:34] you know and all of that even even the
[1:10:36] prophet simeon told to uh married
[1:10:40] on the dedication of jesus he said to
[1:10:43] mary this child will put soil in your
[1:10:46] heart
[1:10:50] because of this child you will have bad
[1:10:52] names because of this child people will
[1:10:54] cross the street when they see you
[1:10:56] walking because of this child
[1:10:58] he says this child will put a sword in
[1:11:00] your heart
[1:11:06] are we together yeah
[1:11:07] now so you see that that is that is one
[1:11:10] of the place
[1:11:12] that is one of the place
[1:11:14] we try to we try to show enough
[1:11:18] praise the lord
[1:11:21] that's one of the place where the uh uh
[1:11:23] uh this this mauling this church
[1:11:28] tried to take away from the christian
[1:11:31] christian uh of faith
[1:11:34] when hebrews 11
[1:11:36] shows us in the scripture
[1:11:38] those men of faith the different things
[1:11:40] that they went through
[1:11:43] they were saw asunder
[1:11:48] praise the lord
[1:11:50] all the different things you went
[1:11:52] through now you see so that's what i had
[1:11:53] on my mind is this uh this weekend i i
[1:11:57] just thought that uh uh
[1:11:59] you know
[1:12:00] wednesday night we come in and sometimes
[1:12:03] we have our prayer meeting and we just
[1:12:05] take a little time to give thanks to the
[1:12:07] lord
[1:12:08] and you know and and then we prayed and
[1:12:10] all of that but uh i think we
[1:12:14] we can trust the law to get back to the
[1:12:16] church i mean get back to the place
[1:12:18] where the church can be able to root off
[1:12:20] their sleeves i mean people can take up
[1:12:22] their shoes i mean and really get down
[1:12:24] to business to pray amen
[1:12:30] now there's kind of offensive brain
[1:12:31] where we you know we look for every verb
[1:12:34] in in you know in in the grammar and
[1:12:36] we're thinking about who's listening to
[1:12:37] me and we're trying to say something to
[1:12:39] impress somebody that is standing right
[1:12:41] sides no
[1:12:47] jesus showing himself that he was
[1:12:49] acquainted with grief
[1:12:51] the bible says he prayed in agony
[1:13:01] he prayed in agony until he was able to
[1:13:04] break sweat
[1:13:07] for you to pray until you break sweat
[1:13:22] are we together
[1:13:23] yes sir
[1:13:29] and i think you know that's that's one
[1:13:31] of the things that is that is uh uh
[1:13:36] that is that is uh that is needed
[1:13:39] of uh
[1:13:42] of the church
[1:13:44] that's one of the place where
[1:13:46] we need to get ourselves to
[1:13:55] that's what i had on my mind tonight so
[1:13:57] uh uh you know uh it's a little bit uh
[1:14:02] tired different things so i go to a a
[1:14:05] missionary but wilson can preach three
[1:14:07] four five five hours
[1:14:09] and preach you do all the preaching
[1:14:14] praise the lord
[1:14:16] but one desire that i have
[1:14:20] for this church
[1:14:22] is to be able to give birth to a church
[1:14:24] that knows how to pray
[1:14:27] there is nothing
[1:14:29] like a church
[1:14:32] where the people enter the building
[1:14:35] and it's not about their clothes
[1:14:37] it's not about the music
[1:14:40] a people that know how to pray it's a
[1:14:42] people that know how to get in business
[1:14:45] with god
[1:14:46] the praying people don't play with the
[1:14:48] word
[1:14:52] a praying church don't play with the
[1:14:54] word no you can never have a prayer life
[1:14:59] and be careless
[1:15:05] praise the lord
[1:15:08] the moment you start breaking into the
[1:15:10] channel of a disciplined prayer life
[1:15:13] where you you find time and and you put
[1:15:15] yourself on schedule with god and you
[1:15:18] respect it
[1:15:19] right there you will start
[1:15:22] disciplining your thoughts you will
[1:15:23] start watching the things that comes out
[1:15:25] of your mouth
[1:15:32] well we never came to church tonight to
[1:15:34] feel sorry for jesus there is no reason
[1:15:36] to feel sorry for him barbara says he
[1:15:38] didn't know he didn't went on a cross
[1:15:40] for the group of people to sit down and
[1:15:42] feel sorry for him
[1:15:48] if there was somebody that need to be
[1:15:50] fear sorry for maybe is this guy here
[1:15:53] i don't know about you
[1:16:04] praise the lord
[1:16:09] if there is one thing
[1:16:11] that
[1:16:17] i carry on my heart for the young people
[1:16:19] in this church
[1:16:21] is for them to be able to
[1:16:22] find god in praying
[1:16:32] i praise the lord
[1:16:35] so this is not your
[1:16:36] your uh
[1:16:38] regular and traditional service of the
[1:16:41] week it's a different one
[1:16:43] and we will just uh
[1:16:45] we just trust the lord tonight
[1:16:47] and uh just like i said uh bill wilson
[1:16:50] would do the preaching for us on the
[1:16:52] weekend
[1:16:53] and we just we just want to encourage
[1:16:55] ourselves a little bit
[1:16:56] and uh and then we will pray then and
[1:16:59] then change the order of the service and
[1:17:00] go right into the communion tonight but
[1:17:02] i just start there with the prayer chain
[1:17:04] we had during the week and those that
[1:17:07] were able to find time to pray
[1:17:09] uh what a beautiful way for us to come
[1:17:11] together
[1:17:12] and uh and
[1:17:15] you know when and and end the entire
[1:17:17] week with a communion night tonight
[1:17:19] praise the lord so that's why we are
[1:17:21] here then i pray that god will be able
[1:17:24] to
[1:17:25] to just uh
[1:17:27] bless each and every one of us praise

[1:17:30] feet we'll sing a song here now and and

[1:31:37] let's pray together tonight
[1:31:43] this is the word of the lord
[1:31:47] and to just
[1:31:50] think about it tonight saints
[1:31:53] that david
[1:31:58] hundreds of years
[1:32:00] before christ
[1:32:03] who experienced this very thing
[1:32:08] hundreds of years
[1:32:13] david honor inspiration
[1:32:18] saying these very words to the god of
[1:32:20] heaven and earth
[1:32:22] god allowing david to prophesy
[1:32:29] do you see the blessing of praying
[1:32:32] that you can enter a chanter of praying
[1:32:36] and god will put things on your lips
[1:32:40] now the things you imagine to say
[1:32:44] but god will put things on your lips
[1:32:48] and you will start saying things to the
[1:32:50] lord
[1:32:55] that god will hold to as a prophecy
[1:32:59] god will put things on your left you
[1:33:00] will start saying concerning your
[1:33:02] children
[1:33:05] you will start saying concerning your
[1:33:07] wife
[1:33:08] or concerning your husband
[1:33:10] not a premeditated thought
[1:33:13] now all these fainting
[1:33:16] grammar that we speak to god
[1:33:18] but i mean when we come to god in agony
[1:33:21] and you can tell david
[1:33:23] in this time it was not a regular prayer
[1:33:26] meeting for david
[1:33:28] this was a time where he needed
[1:33:30] something from the lord
[1:33:32] he was crying out to god he really
[1:33:35] needed something he fed in his heart
[1:33:39] a little sense of abundance
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:46] say oh my god my god why have thou
[1:33:49] forsaken me
[1:33:53] david was not talking about going to
[1:33:55] hell
[1:33:57] somewhere down in his soul he fed the
[1:34:00] need of god
[1:34:02] he know he had been in a place with god
[1:34:05] before
[1:34:06] he had an experience with god
[1:34:10] and he need that touch from god
[1:34:13] he need god to quicken the reality
[1:34:17] of his presence to him
[1:34:21] [Music]

[1:50:42] there should just be enough
[1:50:45] for the reading tonight
[1:50:46] the bible says i mean
[1:50:49] the prophet god says there is no service
[1:50:51] that is that is complete
[1:50:54] without the reading of the word
[1:50:56] praise the lord
[1:50:58] amen

[1:51:29] other things i want to pick up here but
[1:51:31] there is no time for that tonight but
[1:51:34] let's read from verse 11 the bible says
[1:51:38] [Music]
[1:51:41] and every priest standeth daily
[1:51:43] ministering
[1:51:44] and offering
[1:51:47] oftentimes the same sacrifice
[1:51:50] which can never take away sin
[1:51:54] but this man
[1:51:56] after he had offered one sacrifice
[1:52:00] for sins
[1:52:02] forever
[1:52:03] sat down
[1:52:05] on the right hand
[1:52:07] of god
[1:52:08] amen
[1:52:10] father we will ask your blessing upon
[1:52:12] your word now
[1:52:13] and bless the rest of the service in
[1:52:15] jesus name
[1:52:16] amen the lord bless you you may have
[1:52:18] your seat
[1:52:21] and just like i said tonight
[1:52:23] uh i
[1:52:25] never intend to make this a preaching
[1:52:27] service
[1:52:28] you know we we have this this uh idea
[1:52:32] that i think came came away from the
[1:52:34] from the church word
[1:52:36] you know you you look into the word of
[1:52:38] god you look into the message of the
[1:52:40] hour you see brother branham talking
[1:52:42] about uh all night prayer
[1:52:45] and we term to believe
[1:52:47] which of course uh you know i'm i'm i'm
[1:52:49] i'm one of the big fan in that you know
[1:52:52] praying from in the night until in the
[1:52:55] morning
[1:52:56] uh you know but it was it was a period
[1:52:58] of time where the believers came
[1:53:00] together
[1:53:01] and they prayed
[1:53:02] they prayed until they prayed true
[1:53:05] and when they prayed true it's not it's
[1:53:07] not that all night prayer meeting of
[1:53:09] confident and biscuit
[1:53:11] and you know of chewing gum and
[1:53:14] and and music where the people just
[1:53:16] dance all through the night you know
[1:53:18] just to wait away they asleep no it was
[1:53:21] a time where the believers come together
[1:53:24] they pull their heart before god they
[1:53:26] prayed they prayed until they prayed
[1:53:28] through and when they prayed through
[1:53:30] they closed the meeting and and they go
[1:53:31] back you know brother brahm says
[1:53:33] something in the church age i mean in
[1:53:35] the in the in the church order he said
[1:53:37] long prayers he said your long prayers
[1:53:39] must be done in the closet he said when
[1:53:42] we come here it must we we must be able
[1:53:45] to approach god and and you know and and
[1:53:48] speak what is on our heart this is not a
[1:53:50] place for long prayer like brother
[1:53:52] branham said you know i mean sometimes
[1:53:54] we we come to to pray then and then we
[1:53:56] take 30 minutes to pray and you know
[1:53:58] when expressing ourselves and people
[1:54:01] just said i mean
[1:54:02] i mean short prayer no brother brahm
[1:54:04] says our long prayer must be in the
[1:54:06] closet a time that we spend with god
[1:54:09] but when the church decide to come
[1:54:11] together
[1:54:12] for a prayer meeting
[1:54:14] another place he said all night prayer
[1:54:16] meetings are for saints and for people
[1:54:19] that mean business with god
[1:54:21] he said because one time in the book of
[1:54:23] acts they had an all-night prayer
[1:54:25] meeting and one man fell down sleeping
[1:54:27] dead
[1:54:29] the apostles have to pray him back up
[1:54:32] right
[1:54:33] praise the lord
[1:54:34] you know so uh uh
[1:54:36] uh you know as you go along and you
[1:54:38] learn you know it's not it's not a place
[1:54:40] to come and punish the flesh of the
[1:54:41] people i mean if i want to have an
[1:54:43] all-night prayer meeting i want i want
[1:54:45] to bring us here to pray
[1:54:48] it's not just to you know uh play the
[1:54:50] music sing dance and then we get coffee
[1:54:53] cup back there and biscuit to eat and
[1:54:55] all of that
[1:54:57] it must be a time where we have to put
[1:54:59] our heart out if the lord bless us we'll
[1:55:01] have time to do that but this is what i
[1:55:03] want to share with you here in the old
[1:55:06] testament
[1:55:09] tabernacle
[1:55:10] in the old testament tabernacle there
[1:55:12] are things that paul brought out here in
[1:55:15] in hebrew chapter 9 and chapter 10
[1:55:18] chapter 8 9 and 10 where he's talking
[1:55:20] about the tabernacle in the old
[1:55:22] testament tabernacle watch this
[1:55:24] and every priesthood
[1:55:27] daily
[1:55:28] ministering
[1:55:30] and offering
[1:55:32] and an offering often time
[1:55:35] there were no benches in the tabernacle
[1:55:38] there were no seats to sit down
[1:55:43] there was no seat
[1:55:45] so sit down
[1:55:46] now you might say to me brother juan the
[1:55:48] bible said when jesus read from the
[1:55:50] scripture he closed the book and he said
[1:55:52] that that was the temple it's different
[1:55:55] from the tabernacle
[1:55:58] in the old testament tabernacle there
[1:56:00] were no seats
[1:56:05] so the priests
[1:56:07] the high priest and the priests the
[1:56:09] people that came in they all came in and
[1:56:12] they got to business
[1:56:16] it was such a sacrifice
[1:56:18] there was no place to come sit down
[1:56:20] crank your lay back
[1:56:23] to fall asleep
[1:56:25] they came to minister they came to to to
[1:56:28] give an offering they don't have time to
[1:56:30] sit down there were no benches in in the
[1:56:33] old testament tabernacle right
[1:56:37] they came there they they
[1:56:39] they commit themselves to to worship
[1:56:42] commit themselves to sacrifice commit
[1:56:44] themselves to their ordinance they were
[1:56:46] done and they went home
[1:56:48] [Music]
[1:56:53] and then they come back again
[1:56:56] and they do the same thing praise the
[1:56:58] lord
[1:57:00] amen
[1:57:03] but the bible says here
[1:57:05] but this man talking about jesus our
[1:57:08] high priest after
[1:57:11] he had offered one sacrifice for sin
[1:57:14] forever he sat down
[1:57:17] because he brought the perfect sacrifice
[1:57:20] there was no need to come back again the
[1:57:23] work was done
[1:57:26] he said it is finish
[1:57:30] go back to genesis chapter one after
[1:57:33] god's work was finished he rested
[1:57:37] that's when you sit down
[1:57:40] praise the lord
[1:57:41] amen
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:44] don't worry i'm not going to take the
[1:57:45] chairs from church
[1:57:46] [Music]
[1:57:51] i'm just trying to say that it's it's
[1:57:53] not the place you see we we we take the
[1:57:56] the the the attitude to come to church
[1:57:59] and and and and and just create some
[1:58:02] comfort around ourself you know what we
[1:58:04] can lay back sometimes i see people lay
[1:58:07] back and stretch their leg in front lay
[1:58:09] their head on this on the seat no we
[1:58:11] must come ready for service
[1:58:16] praise the lord
[1:58:18] that's that that is the new age church
[1:58:20] the newest church is a church of
[1:58:22] entertaining
[1:58:23] [Music]
[1:58:25] and that and that same thing is
[1:58:27] beginning to fall among us
[1:58:29] [Music]
[1:58:31] when we just come to church we want for
[1:58:33] the pastor to say something let the
[1:58:35] minister say something that would you
[1:58:37] know something that i've never heard
[1:58:38] before
[1:58:39] [Music]
[1:58:40] or other message was not inspired
[1:58:42] tonight then
[1:58:44] we come with that attitude
[1:58:47] praise the lord
[1:58:48] [Music]
[1:58:55] our attitude is supposed to be
[1:58:57] ministering and and and offering to god
[1:59:00] offering praise
[1:59:02] joining the joining the preacher in the
[1:59:04] world when he says something that is the
[1:59:06] word of god we say amen because we know
[1:59:08] that's the word of god whether we have
[1:59:10] heard it before or we have not heard it
[1:59:12] before we say amen to the word
[1:59:16] we lift our hands we we worship the lord
[1:59:19] there was something also that paul
[1:59:21] dropped here i will share that with you
[1:59:23] and then i'll find a place to close i
[1:59:25] don't want to preach tonight he says
[1:59:28] uh uh if you look in the book in the
[1:59:30] book here this is one of the place where
[1:59:32] paul used
[1:59:34] booze and goats
[1:59:36] right
[1:59:38] in in hebrew there was one of the places
[1:59:40] where paul described
[1:59:42] the the the the old testament sacrifice
[1:59:46] when he used bulls and goats
[1:59:49] bulls and gods
[1:59:51] were the sacrifices
[1:59:53] that were made
[1:59:54] for the priests and the people
[1:59:57] according to the book of leviticus the
[1:59:59] priest was supposed to make offering for
[2:00:02] himself confess his sin make offering
[2:00:05] for himself and come and make offering
[2:00:07] for the people
[2:00:08] now so the priests all the offering that
[2:00:11] he made
[2:00:12] was a bull
[2:00:15] you see god
[2:00:17] god put the that's that you see that's
[2:00:19] what jesus said if you can't take the
[2:00:22] the the the beam that is in your eyes
[2:00:26] you know
[2:00:26] he he poked the preacher or put the
[2:00:29] priest to the place for them to always
[2:00:31] be conscious
[2:00:33] so the only sacrifice that they had to
[2:00:35] deal with was a big boat
[2:00:38] he see that's the reason why it's so
[2:00:41] easy when a preacher make mistakes
[2:00:43] everybody see it
[2:00:45] because his his sacrifice is a big boat
[2:00:48] your own is just a little kid
[2:00:51] a little goat
[2:00:54] the little god was for the people
[2:00:56] [Music]
[2:00:58] but you see what god was doing was he
[2:01:00] was putting the priest to the place
[2:01:03] to be conscious never to overlook
[2:01:07] his office
[2:01:08] he was all he was representing the the
[2:01:12] that you are a human being
[2:01:15] yeah when you look at this big bull you
[2:01:18] realize that you are a man born insane
[2:01:21] shepherd of iniquity you must always be
[2:01:23] conscious of that the puppet never
[2:01:25] brings the minister to the place to be
[2:01:28] divine
[2:01:29] and don't bring the minister to the
[2:01:31] place
[2:01:32] you see that's the reason why people can
[2:01:34] go all over the internet and say
[2:01:36] whatever they want to say about brother
[2:01:38] branham because he had an open life the
[2:01:41] life of a preacher is an open life
[2:01:44] it's not a lie behind the curtains
[2:01:48] you cannot hide a bull can you hire a
[2:01:50] bull the bull is bigger than you how
[2:01:52] will you hide it
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:57] praise the lord
[2:01:58] better brandon gave us his life story he
[2:02:01] tells us everything about his life and
[2:02:03] and and
[2:02:04] and and and and and i told him i told my
[2:02:06] wife to tell him i'm not yet he i mean
[2:02:09] he opened his life to us
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:15] well many of us the only thing we said
[2:02:17] about ourselves is just praises
[2:02:19] [Music]
[2:02:21] how we know how we did this and how we
[2:02:23] did that we just want praises but the
[2:02:26] life of a priest
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:29] is an open testament
[2:02:31] [Music]
[2:02:34] we are not carrying anything on our
[2:02:35] sleeves
[2:02:38] praise the lord
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:44] so there are different things that paul
[2:02:47] represented here
[2:02:48] trying to bring
[2:02:50] the picture of the old testament
[2:02:52] tabernacle to us
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:02:57] and just like i said from the beginning
[2:02:59] of the meeting tonight
[2:03:01] while we were praying
[2:03:04] that's the difference between you and
[2:03:06] myself
[2:03:08] the christian faith
[2:03:11] by the blood of jesus christ
[2:03:13] we have
[2:03:15] a sacrifice
[2:03:17] one that have died
[2:03:19] and have gone to the throne of the
[2:03:21] father to present himself
[2:03:25] that's the reason why the jews
[2:03:28] they cannot you cannot have true worship
[2:03:31] without a sacrifice
[2:03:32] [Music]
[2:03:37] the jews do not have a temple
[2:03:40] they cannot make all of these sacrifice
[2:03:42] bulls and go they can't do it
[2:03:45] because the marks of oman is standing on
[2:03:47] that temple
[2:03:52] you see that's that that is the thing
[2:03:53] when i see all of these people that want
[2:03:55] to be masonic christian you know uh
[2:03:58] jesus hamashiach they want to be jews
[2:04:01] when they don't know the implication
[2:04:03] when god has already made a perfect
[2:04:05] provision it's not identifying with it
[2:04:08] with a physical identifying with the
[2:04:11] nation of israel that make you
[2:04:13] acceptable to god
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:24] praise the lord
[2:04:29] and even though
[2:04:31] the worshiper
[2:04:33] has to bring a goat you don't have to
[2:04:35] bring a
[2:04:36] boat but also
[2:04:40] his life
[2:04:43] is not a private life
[2:04:45] [Music]
[2:04:47] it's not a private life
[2:04:49] he has to walk through the street of
[2:04:51] jerusalem with that goat
[2:04:54] as he goes to the temple and everybody
[2:04:56] that sees him knows that he's going to
[2:04:58] confess his sin on that god
[2:05:01] and that goat is going to to be killed
[2:05:04] for him
[2:05:08] you don't have a private life with god
[2:05:12] god called you to be a public servant
[2:05:15] yes
[2:05:16] and to be a public servant your life
[2:05:18] must be open
[2:05:24] and you must allow people to say
[2:05:26] whatever they want to say about you
[2:05:29] that's why the public seven eggs
[2:05:34] you must be able to lift him
[2:05:36] and take in
[2:05:39] and take in
[2:05:52] but we have one man
[2:05:57] praise the lord
[2:05:59] he stood up
[2:06:02] for three and a half years
[2:06:06] into the father temple
[2:06:09] he said destroy this temple in three
[2:06:11] days i will raise it up three and a half
[2:06:13] years
[2:06:14] his life was open his birth was open
[2:06:18] every newspaper in jerusalem carried
[2:06:24] his baptism was open
[2:06:29] his death
[2:06:31] was open on the hill
[2:06:34] that the lowest man could see him
[2:06:49] we take our christian life out of our
[2:06:51] pocket when we come to church
[2:06:55] when we are out there we put it back in
[2:06:57] our pocket
[2:07:09] [Music]
[2:07:11] may god
[2:07:12] help every one of us tonight amen
[2:07:15] praise the lord
[2:07:24] that was the reason why paul speaks
[2:07:26] about the bulls and goat
[2:07:30] because it represented
[2:07:32] the sacrifice of the priests
[2:07:35] and the sacrifice of the people
[2:07:41] how our sacrifice and our service to god
[2:07:45] must be in public view
[2:07:48] by the life that we live
[2:07:50] the things that we do
[2:07:52] the places that we go our life must be
[2:07:55] in the plain view
[2:07:57] [Music]

[2:09:50] let us praise
[2:09:54] [Music]
[2:10:06] reading from verse 23
[2:10:10] for i have received of the lord that
[2:10:12] which also i deliver unto you
[2:10:15] that the lord jesus the same night in
[2:10:17] which he was betrayed took bread
[2:10:20] and when he had given thanks he break it
[2:10:23] and said take eat
[2:10:26] this is my body which is broken for you
[2:10:31] this is due in remembrance of me
[2:10:34] after the same man and also he took the
[2:10:37] cup
[2:10:38] when he have stopped saying
[2:10:40] this cup
[2:10:43] is the new testament of my blood
[2:10:46] this due year as of as he drink it in
[2:10:50] remembrance of me
[2:10:52] for as often as he eat this bread and
[2:10:55] drink this cup yet to show the lord's
[2:10:57] death
[2:10:58] till he come
[2:11:00] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:11:03] and drink this cup of the lord on
[2:11:05] waterline shall be guilty of the body
[2:11:08] and the blood of the lord
[2:11:11] but let a man examine himself
[2:11:13] and so let him eat
[2:11:15] of that bread and drink of that cup
[2:11:19] for he that eateth and drink it on
[2:11:21] walter left eat it and drink a damnation
[2:11:24] to himself
[2:11:25] not discerning the lord's body
[2:11:28] for this cause many
[2:11:31] are weak and sacred among you and many
[2:11:34] sleep
[2:11:35] for if we would judge ourselves
[2:11:40] we should not be george but when we are
[2:11:43] judged we are testing of the lord that
[2:11:46] we should not be condemned with the word
[2:11:49] wherefore my brethren when you come
