person in the building this morning [Music] glory be to god the lord bless you may lord bless you [Music] and want to want to thank you and uh for myself my family i want to appreciate you for all your prayers and all your support thank you for all the the birthday wishes and but this weekend uh is is a bit very very significant to me and uh especially today 1991 that was that was the day i got saved just two days after my birthday so uh the sunday is very very very uh significant to me now this would be 30 years when i got saved and 27 years in the ministry so having three more years for you to bear with me because i'm not mentor yet so you get three more years to bear with all my foolishness praise the lord when i get 30 years then you can hold me accountable if i do those things praise the lord amen because uh [Music] uh scripturally this is scripturally and prophetically also i'll share some few things with you before we before we get into the word here numbers chapter 4 verse 1 uh to 3 sorry my voices is i think you notice i've been struggling with my voice now since uh last week sunday i kind of pressed on my voice too hard and and started drinking cold things so it's kind of for crack uh i i try to put a man in my mouth too to help me break the crack so you just got to bear with me amen if you can understand me just follow my signs okay am i preaching sign language just follow my signs or ask the person next to you what is he saying numbers chapter four the bible says and the law speaks unto moses and aaron saying take the psalm of the sons of koheth from among the sons of levi after their family by the house of their father from 30 years old of war even until 50 years old all that enter into the host to do the work in the tabernacle of israel now the the thing about the book of numbers is that in the book of numbers that's where the tribes were numbered that's why they called it the book of numbers because it did with numbers and you will see the numbers of the tribe you will see the numbers of of different things so there are different numbers there and if you study the book of numbers you will realize from the age of 20 years old a man was mentored to go to war but at the age of 30 years old them of the tribe of levites were now mentored to self in the house of the lord are we together second samuel chapter two reading from verse one then came all the trap of ezra to david unto hebron and speak saying behold we are the bones in that flesh also in time past when saul was king over us thou thou he that leadeth out and and brought it in israel and the lord said to thee thou shall feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel so all the elders of israel came to the king to abram and king david made a league with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david or they anointed david king over israel david was 30 years old when he became to reign and he reigned 40 years so david also was annoyed 30 years if you look in the life of david he had three different anointing we know that samuel anointed david praise the lord samuel announced david but david never came to the throne but yet he was anointed king are we together am i right amen that first samuel chapter 16 verse 13 that's where the uh uh sami or the prophet anointed david ii samuel chapter 2 verse 4 david is anointed king in judah by the men of judah and then year david is anointed and now placed on the throne praise the lord so he got three anointings in his life praise the lord but this anointing in second samuel chapter five it goes with it goes with a prophetic other because now yeah so you see he was anointed to be king but yet he had to be trained so everything that david was going through like war running away from saul and all of that god was using that to train him to prepare him for the throne amen that is the same thing that paul taught in the book of galatians that's the reason why the sons were given tutor even though they were hears of their father they have a right to the inheritance but they need a tutor to teach them so when they come to power they will they will rightly be able to use it because power power with our character we know that is demonic it's a tonic praise the lord so you see yeah you know a man can have a calling in his life and and i mean he can just be on fire for god i mean it is i mean that is not just all to it right that is not just all to it you can feed the chord of god in your life you know you have a gift but you are not place you are not placed so either you be you'll be rooming around and you'll be using a genuine gift to cause problems because you are not blessed you have not come to maturity yet that's why i said bear with me three years just be patient amen just be patient if i don't if i don't mention then kick me out find somebody else [Laughter] oh praise the lord i know you're thinking in your mind where is this guy coming from this morning what is he up to i'm on the birthday spiel amen glory be to god amen so you see brother branham got his commission 1933. the angel said your message will forerun the second coming of the lord it never came until 1963 30 years the lord john the baptist never came to his ministry until 30 years old from nine years he went into the wilderness he never came out the people never saw him until 30 years and he and jesus came almost the same time six months apart because his ministry was only for six months and jesus came into his ministry at 30 years for three years ministry so you can have training out of your life just for a one day ministry god could train you all of your life maybe you are the stubborn type just like me just for a one-day ministry so he can use you just for one purpose and he pleasing the rest you're doing it for yourself praise the lord you know so this this is uh kind of very very significant to me thank the lord i had a lot of time to do some reflections and take inventory and just think about some things you know and just ask the lord for for more grace so i appreciate that some brother area i was thinking about thinking something yes but it was an appropriate son i need you lord amen if there's ever a time that i need the lord is right now it's right now praise the lord you know because i mean many many good preachers you know never never reach to maturity you know they just they just uh the the i mean they get so prideful on the on uh you know on the uh the primary stage of the ministry you know they think they know it all and uh uh and and that's one of the things that is that is hard in order uh to to teach people you know it's very hard you know it's very hard but uh we pray that the lord will be able to help each and every one of us so we say thank you thank you for all your prayers and uh thank you for all your support like i've always said it take a good church to make a good pastor amen praise the lord he can have all of the anointing if you don't have the people to receive him he will never be a blessing so we thank you for all of your support and and everything you know so yeah i have these things right here okay yet i have another thing here in my note that i was also looking at in uh elisha had to grow 10 years you know to fake the mentor of elijah you know he said where is the god of elijah he used it you know and split the jordan but yet for him to get to that place he had to self and learn under the feet of elijah for 10 years joshua had to do the same you know he had to learn at the feet of moses not even knowing that he was going to come into the office of a prophet to lead the people so we have to we have to look we have to watch those things you know we have to watch this thing it just i mean serving god you have to understand it it's it's it's not it's not an it's not an individual thing you hear this thing salvation is an individual thing it's only individual in the way that god deals with you in the way he deals with you which means he do not pass through somebody else to deal with you he want to deal with you personally that is the individual basis it's not you on an island it's not you trying to do your own thing and you hear people i'm just saving my god if your god is not my god i don't want the other god you're saving the concept of the church is a family the concept of the church when god made man in the beginning the very concept was to have a family he expressed that in the accident he told moses i would have made the people a family of priests so god's mind for his church is to deal with them as a family praise the lord so in a family we don't look for individual success praise the lord you are not successful if the whole family is doing bad and only you doing good [Music] so uh uh we need uh more of uh we need more grace we need more grace we need the lord to teach us each and every day so we can be able to walk close to him praise the lord amen yeah if you read the books read the book of the kings or chronicles you'll realize that most of the kings most of the kings biblical principle if you just watch between the line most of the kings came to the throne tete and plus yes just watch just watch it i know there are some like you know uh josiah and the rest of them that came younger you know samuel was anointed you know uh called he was called actually from a from a youthful age you know there are those conditions there but but scripture also have you know a general rule praise the lord amen some some people listening early then god starts to deal with them some people are stubborn and you know it's just it just takes a while and we have some of the stubborn type they have taken us a while praise the lord so i have some few things on my mind i was going to share with you and i've even forgot brother jordan uh i forgot that you were supposed to come out in and announce uh uh the come come in come and take care of that come and take care of that i told you if you don't remind me that just how it will be nobody's saying i'll just be real brief most of you have already probably seen this flyer because i noticed most of them are already missing but brother wanted asked me to put together a little event for mostly young people and families but if you're feeling young at heart you're more than welcome as you can see here it's

is [Music] has never yet been told [Applause] praise the lord amen you just blame me for everything you know i'm the one spoiling the song amen the lord bless you you may have uh musicians thank you let's go to the word i i taught for us to sing this song because you will see where the inspiration of this song came from as we read the scripture right now second chronicles chapter nine ii chronicles chapter 9 ii chronicles chapter 9. let's read the word of the lord and when the queen of sheba heard of the firm of solomon she came to prove solomon with hard questions hard questions praise the lord she did not believe everything she came to prove solomon with hard questions and that's what i want you young people to do prove this message with her question praise the lord amen don't sit down and just look and just third because we are not forcing anything down your throat we are bringing you to the river but we can force you to drink we're just telling you that this is the water of life drink from it and you'll be freed of all your problems she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem wave a very great company in camels that bear spices and gold in abundance and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart everything that she pondered on she was not holding back and just observing if she sees something she asked what is this praise the lord so she can say they say somebody said no i want to know what is this there's no sitting on the fence you are either in or you are out and solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing here from solomon which he told her not and when the queen of sheba have seen the wisdom of solomon and the house that he have built which was the temple of the lord and they meet at his table and the setting of his servants and the attendants of his ministers and their parents i mean solomon has such an order he was a man that believed in church order he had all of these things just in place they caught bearer also and they had a peril and and uh and he's a sense by which he went up into the house of the law there was no more spirit left in her when she saw how a man a human by wisdom could be able to just both things get this insane bring this and say to men that are also made out of flesh and blood praise the lord the lord bless you keep right there we'll stay reading but have your seed because it looks live already start preaching you know to see how a man's wisdom could bring decency could bring others praise the lord amen could bring others and and sins of god and people of god that's what i want you to look at that's what i want you to look at what have this word of god what have this message brought to your life praise the lord what have you brought to your home you think it's your own making praise the lord i mean there's just some things floating on my mind now but i'll be very undecent if i say those things you go to people's homes and you you you see it i mean they they get they get things of quality things of expense i mean very expensive things that they pay money for but you just see the way they put you know some things in and just having some fill the the living room with uh uh you know ten thousand waffle thing and then put a filtered picture on the wall just because of that it makes you does not even appreciate the cause of the things that that is in the room but that this word will bring decency to you young people that you can look at yourself before you step out of the house many people don't look at themselves they don't look at themselves before they step out of their house because if they were really looking at themselves they won't get out with some of the things they are wearing but how many times you dress you go no i can wear this i have to change when she saw those things the bible says there was no spirit left in her and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard in my own land of that act in all of thy wisdom praise the lord remember the scripture says she heard of the frame of solomon and she purposed in her heart to go and ask him the hard questions and she asked him all her questions there was some she did not even ask solomon in answering one question answer 10 for her because that's what the word of god does the word of god address one thing in your life is addressing 10 different things that are connected with the with those things and not only her questions but just seeing the kind of for other and decency that this man gave brought to the people of israel the bible says she had no spirit left in her in a sense i've never seen this in my life my goodness are we on earth praise the lord and that's what the holy spirit wants to do in your home when unbelievers come in your home and just see the the the all you don't have to have ten thousand dollar things in your home all you need to have is just the grace of god and the holy spirit in that home a bible that is read every morning and every night and she said to the king it was a truth report i heard in my own lane of all the knights in that wisdom howbeit i believe not their worst i never took believe this message because somebody said it to me no i wanted a personal experience it's not as second-handed handled down by somebody praise the lord and young people don't take it from your parents get your own personal experience how be it i believe in that i believe not the hours until i came and my eyes have seen it and behold the one half all that greatness or the greatness of that wisdom was not told me that's the way the inspiration of that song with your son came from they have has never yet been told praise the lord and behold the one half of that greatness the greatness of that wisdom was not told me for thou sealeth the frame that i heard you more than what i heard she said happy are thy men and happy are the sevens we stand continuously before thee and hear thy wisdom blessed be the lord thy god who delighted in thee to set thee on his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god love israel to establish them forever they've therefore made he the king over them to do judgment and justice in another in another sense she was saying she was saying that for god to be able to entrust you for god to be able to entrust a mortal a man born of a woman for god to be able to entrust a woman with three sacrifice you you must count yourself blessed it's not depriving you because what the world will have done to you is worse than what the grace of god is doing in your life for god to get you at a young age and start dealing with your heart if you are regretting you better repent that's what i can say to you because you think you are regretting now that god will delight in thee to set thee on his throne make you king over his people she said the half has never yet been told and i will tell you you can read all the thousand plus messages of brother branham the half that came by this ministry you will never know in this life all that you think you know of the message and even of this bible the half you will never know glory be to god here we seen a woman the scripture went on and said and she gave the kings hundreds and and 120 talents of god she brought all of these things if if they are really saying you think about it you are waiting you are just imagining you know you know you just thinking on your mind about this place they are talking about or they set in person and people you know uh you're having you're taught you know talk about wisdom where i i wonder what people are saying that i don't know whether he's guessing he's reading mine or whatever it is you know uh and and even till today people struggle when they listen to the tape and yeah brother branham honored those discernment calling people named they still struggle you know but you know uh it's just god that can give revelation amen if god don't help you there is no mortal in this life that can help you sorry that i can do it myself amen so she brought out of these things she brought gates she brought spices she brought precious stones she said if this thing is truth i'm going to i'm going to support it with everything that i have i'm going to let go and let god have his way praise the lord she says happy are the men the people that stand before you every day the children they have been hearing the prophet said the prophet said from the day that they were born you must be happy praise the lord if you if your parents were training you to wash your brother branham then they were training you wrong but if they were saying they are so you will reference the word of god and the gift that god gave to this age blessed are you because those words will haunt you to your grave if you ever stray from them you ask joshua ali he will tell you a little bit of it happy have thy man happy at our seventh we stand continuously and hear that wisdom praise the lord glory be to god and we know that jesus refer to the art of this woman that's what i want to get to this morning i hope i won't keep you long i've heard the rumor time by playing guitar but uh i hope i won't keep you long because we have a community service tonight so i mean this evening this is a miracle sorry i never got back to you on that text i kept thinking about it it kept slipping my mind i'm very sorry for that and uh uh so we realized that jesus referred to the act of this woman in matthew chapter 12 let's go there a little bit what she says a woman from the south amen he said the queen of the south shall stand against this generation amen she said the queen of the south praise the lord let me bring you to terms a little bit with matthew chapter 12. matthew chapter 12 is uh the breach between the ministry of jesus christ and the sahendra's counsel jesus has bear with them right from his birth they call his birth an elite illegitimate birth he had there with them and you know and all sorts of things they said about him praise the lord and uh they call him all sorts of names but matthew chapter 12 was the bridge and what happened in matthew chapter 12. what happened in matthew chapter 12 it was the place where uh uh uh the the the pharisees the local the gift of jesus in verse 24 and it said that everything that he's doing is because he is the prince of the devils praise the lord and what are the things that he's doing he's healing their sake praise the lord amen he met a a woman that was broken broke him because her son died that could have been her own son and he stopped the funeral procession and brought the ball back to life he did the same thing in jara's house praise the lord what was he doing healing the sack raising the dead and even feeding their multitudes that they can have 12 baskets left over to take home praise the lord but with all of that that he was doing just because he could not condescend to their religious idea or what they think religion is they are saying he is the prince of the devil praise the lord that will end jesus public ministry the next time that they will see him publicly that's when he will come on the donkey and few days he will be taken to calvary that's what matthew chapter 12 is is the bridge when they call him the prince of devils verse 25 by the pharisees heard it they said this fellow does not cast our devil but by bestiable the prince of the devil and jesus knew their thoughts and he said unto them every kingdom divided against itself shall not stand if satan said now you you can read that words and and and and whichever way the tune of your voice is but i believe that jesus was very steadfast i believe that he was very emotional that you call the work of god the devil and the word you can say that against the son of man will be forgiving you but one word said against the holy ghost will not be forgiving you in this word or in the word to come and just like i told you before jesus never said when you blast him the holy ghost fire will fall from heaven he never said it and that's the reason why people can blaspheme the holy ghost they can say things about the church they can say things about the people of god and and be living free they think that it's okay but he says it will not be forgiving you in this world or in the world to come so wait for your reward at the day of judgment praise the lord we will bear your insult for now but wait for your reward so that was the breach he said if our bible cast devils by whom your sons your children cast them out by now so jesus honor this honor this emotional expression trying to tell them that you call yourself religious leaders your ministry has filled these people you have never been able to bring revival you get a lot of moses but yet you get bad girls and sick people all in your streets and yes a man ministry that have taken god out of history yes a man administrator have called jesus on the scene the same yesterday today and forever he says and then you turn around and call this the devil praise the lord so jesus is honor he's he's on this emotion dealing with him then he comes to the same praise the lord he said unto them an evil and adopted generation seek after sign but no sign will be given to you he said there will be no sign given to you except the sign of no uh jonah praise the lord now you have to watch this now you have to watch this because we are industry we are in the scripture and even industrial generation seek after sign and there shall no sign be giving unto it by the sign of the prophet jonah as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the well praise the lord so jesus now is taking what happened to jonah and then which of course jesus saying that means that it was not just a fairy tale amen if jesus who compared his death barrier and resurrection to what happened to jonah then which means it really happened so he talks he takes jonah as a sign of the resurrection praise the lord as jonah spent three days in a wheelbarrow so the son of man we also spent three days in the heart of the earth so jesus said that that would be your last sign will be the resurrection your last sign will be an empty tome that's the last thing israel you will see an empty tomb praise the lord they honor their same burden he says the queen of the south now he's dealing with his ministry but yet he's bringing in another woman he's bringing in a gentile ministry he's bringing in a gentile church praise the lord so in another sense what jesus is saying there is that you have rejected your visitation and this visitation that you have rejected the gentiles will rejoice in it because just like how the queen of the south traveled from fire to come and see the wisdom of solomon [Music] praise the lord and i believe that's that's that's where we came from we came from fire we came from idolatry we came from witchcraft we came from every darkness of adolescence praise the lord to come be worshipping god in spirit and truth he brought us from fire amen if you can say amen to the word of god god brought your spirit from fire the queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation and she and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon now this is another place that is also tricky she never came because of solomon she came because of the gift she came because of the wisdom of solomon it was not the man that attracted her it was the gift that was manifested [Music] praise the lord we're not following the man we are following fulfilled scripture malachi 4 says behold i send you elijah the prophet saying luke 17 30 says in the day that the son of man will be revealed revelation 10 7 says in the voice of the seven angel we are following fulfilled scripture we're not following the man she came from the south to hear the wisdom of solomon and he says behold i said unto you and greater than solomon is here amen a greater than solomon you know when you hear a greater than solomon it's so easy for you to think is the man it's not the man what is important here is the ministry jesus in another term you are saying the same way solomon brought and not one other to the temple of god a ministry is here to bring a natural order in the spirit of man whether we worship god in spirit and in truth a greater than solomon is year a gift that will change our lives that will make us decent men and decent ladies a gift that will rob us the gift will rob us it will rob you from all your wickedness your selfishness praise the lord that's what this holy ghost would do for you it will rob you from all your habits glory be to god it will rob you so much that when he's finished dealing with you you will not know how to find a way to go back to the be a pilot he will rob you until if they put a cigarette in your hand you don't know what to do with it glory be to god amen the things that you used to love he he gets in there and he takes the desire try to do it you can't do it because why you can't find fun in doing it he takes the desire that's all he takes he just take the desire he destroys the desire a greater than solomon is here praise the lord and greater than solomon is here she said of the things that i've heard and the things that i've seen i believe that the half has never yet been told all that i've seen praise the lord and bring us to that place where paul says that he that thinketh he know does not know as he ought to know because there is more to know there is more of god to know there is more of grace to know praise the lord you see because christ and dark matters it just block our mind it stopped us in a certain level of understanding and we think that is all of god but the love of god carry you beyond every situation so jesus referring back to that lady she was a gentile woman she was not a jew she was a gentile she came from the south jesus said the outermost part of the earth because she hear the wisdom of solomon she heard about a gift that can answer all your questions praise the lord just like daniel said he is the deserver of every doubt praise the lord a greater than solomon is here praise the lord hallelujah oh what a wonderful wonderful jesus we serve let's read this in revelation chapter 4. this is from the revelation series let's read this the 24 editors here in revelation chapter 4 you will realize that john that john saw some things in the book of revelation and those things were even from the beginning amen but john saw it in a complete different way like we said when we talk about the cherry beans you know there were two cherry beans that was placed in the garden of eden moses on a vision that's why he saw when god says block the tree of life but ezekiel saw and he saw the same cherubim but he saw it from another place when isaiah saw the the the those angels he saw them from another place he saw them like a train they are different from the seraphims he saw the seraphim but he saw the cherubims moving so fast like a train and when john saw the same cherubians he saw them with four faces in the book of revelation but now we're not talking about the cherubians we're talking about the glory let's read yet a little bit you will see remember it made it with the earth his colors but now watch this rainbow only horizontally just cover in the ball now this is this is showing pointing back to the coveting of noah praise the lord to the covenant of noah when god made the covenant with noah are we together and he brought the floor to an end and what did god do he shoot a rainbow in the clouds amen now so the rainbow goes from one end and you cover the class and it goes to another end praise the lord now so what is described here what brother branham is describing here is that what what noah saw or moses described in the book of genesis as the rainbow was the same light that was around the throne in an amber color now so for noah it came as a half why because god was making confidence with his people praise the lord amen he was making confidence with the earth and his people and what he was telling them is that i give you it's almost like the chinese laundry man the rainbow is like the chinese laundry man he never knew how to speak or write so he cut the paper into two halves and he gave the owner of the clothes half and he kept half to himself so god was showing in the heavens that that wish concerning redeeming the earth and redeeming his people i'm giving half and i will keep half to myself that's the reason why the mistress of god needed to be revealed in this day because it held back the secret of redemption glory be to god let's study the flood a little bit uh genesis chapter eight genesis chapter eight we know the number eight means a new day amen and brother everyone you when you say i'm taking it up a little bit that thing just struck my mind as that's on on on the piano the 8th key is an octave it means a new level i'm not a music teacher but [Laughter] because the number eight means a new day and right in genesis 8 god was about to start a new day on earth after the flood ended oh praise the lord falling in love with jesus is the best thing to have ever happened amen genesis chapter 8 [Music] and the lord god and god remember noah in every living thing and all the cattles that was with him in the ark and god made a win to pass over the earth praise the lord and the watered eyes wage and the fountain also of the deep and the windows of heaven was stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained praise the lord amen and the waters return from of the earth continuously and after the end of the 150 days the water were a bit now watch this now there is something that is hidden in here i know i did it to myself i left my notes on this in my bible at home but it's okay i will do my best the act rested on the seventh month praise the lord they are rested on the seventh month on the 17th day of the month upon the mountain of areas now brother branham spoke about it he brought out those days there but there is something that is healing in that text that you will appreciate if you just look at the dates there now you have to realize that if moses is giving an account here and says the act rested on the seventh month he's using the silver calendar because the jews have two calendars praise the lord they have the silver calendar and they also have a religious calendar now the religious calendar came to birth in exeter are we together amen now they were in the seven months of the year are we together they are they were in the seven months of the year which is the month of nissan and god told them that this month will be the beginning of months are we together so you see how the jewish people came about with the two calendars because it was in the month of nisan when god told them that this month would be the beginning of months so he gave them a new calendar that is completely different from this praise the lord amen it's completely different from this because this is an event before accident are we together i drew a chat yesterday i stuck it in my bible at home when i got home last night and uh i don't have the time to do it here but uh the half has never yet been told bro this whole problem on me this morning but let's let's just let's do it on it a little bit i'll give you the concept maybe by the grace of god i'll bring the chat in and so you can appreciate it so you will realize here so what is happening now what is happening now think about it now so the seventh month in the silver calendar is the first month in the religious calendar are we together am i confusing you they have two calendars they have a religious calendar because they have to follow you have to realize that this religious kalana has all the dates for their feasts all the feast days that that that the the the the observe the the tub and even the passover now this is excellent let's go to accident let's go to accident praise the lord exodus chapter 12. amen exodus chapter 12. exodus chapter 12 reading from uh verse one and the law speaks unto moses and unto aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months this did not begin the jewish calendar this began their religious calendar why because god was about to establish an ordinance with him the reason why is the beginning of months because he's going to establish the passover are we together amen now so you have to realize that they already had a form of kalana that they were following this was not january 1st they were already in the middle of the year but god is coming down mantle says now right now we're going to start a new beginning this is going to be a new beginning praise the lord this month that i'm bringing you out of egypt is going to be the beginning of months for you but then in comparing to the silver calendar praise the lord if i if if i would have said that thought about it earlier i would have asked brother jordan to pull that out for me in comparing to the to the to the silver colander that they have the the the the month is already the year is already in the seventh month praise the lord but then in the seventh month god is now beginning a new order a new day with them and said this is the beginning of months are we together now the reason why is going to be very interesting is that if you bring this seven month in comparing to the religious calendar it's the first month of the year are we together now the scripture says here that uh uh and on the religious calendar there in uh in exeter that we have just read let's let's go down a little bit amen verse verse 6 and ye shall keep it up until the 14 days of the same month praise the lord are we together so now you will realize that the 14th day is the passover are we together amen if the 14th day is the passover word the sacrifice is killed and then according to the scripture jesus resurrected after three days yeah so 3 to 14 is how much 17. so the very day that the act rest arrested was a prophecy of jesus resurrection praise the lord god forgive me if i confuse you praise the lord but see it is a new beginning god is going to have a new beginning with the earth the earth has already gone out of judgment forty days and forty night god has struck the earth because of the evil and now he's going to start a new covenant it's right in genesis chapter 8 the last verse where he says summer winter will never change as long as the earth remains so in genesis chapter 8 god is establishing a new covenant with the earth are we together amen are we are we together amen so he's establishing a new covenant with the earth and right in there he's also bringing a prophecy praise lord which means the new covenant with the earth is is a sign of the day of our new birth what uh uh uh what the the dead yes peak the seven month and the seventeen day speaks of in genesis year is pointing to the resurrection of jesus christ it does not have no natural fulfillment for the gentiles it does not have a natural fulfillment that may 17 something is going to happen no it was only a place there as a prophet saying are we together because that seven months is the month of nisan which is the month of abba that is the first month of the religious calendar and on the 14th day is the passover that's when the passover is killed are we together so when a passover is killed on the 14th day and our passover was killed on the 14th day and then he resurrected three days after that goes back to the 17 of nissan praise the lord are we together but let's go ahead here amen now so you see here over here in this new new covenant that god is establishing with the earth what brother branham is saying there in revelation series is that yeah in the book of revelation chapter 4 when john look at the troon he's seeing a halo light that is in a full cycle and the com the hill of light he's seen in revelation because the bible says it was all around the throne the hill of light he's seen in revelation is the exact representation of what the rainbow was but when the rainbow came up it came as half the rainbow just that's why it was called a ball or as it would be called a ring cycle it was called a ball because a ball is a half of a cycle when you strike a ball it becomes half of a cycle praise the lord so god was stretching his board oh my that's the thing that would get into the devil's eye because god healed he had the redemption secret of his children to himself the devil thought he knew that's the reason why he wanted to destroy sarah before isaac would be born the lord because as much as if abimelech would have slept with with syrup it would destroy the promise that's the reason why he wanted to destroy moses killed all the child when moses was born and why because he thought he was guessing oh yeah maybe this is the woman's seed but the half was kept to god the half was kept praise the lord the half of your life was kept to god praise the lord what god will use to bring you to your knees only he knows if you are a child of god what he will use to have you crawl back to the kingdom only god knows you can be stubborn as a rock but god has he has the main thing with him what you have you just you just have you know 20 years of story that you know they have has never yet been told what you will go through what your life will become they have has never yet been told all you young people that you think you smart and you know what you want i know what i want for my life i know what i want nobody can tell me what i want i know what i want that's when your mouth become crooked glory be to god this is a gentile woman coming from idolatry knowing nothing about jehovah god but she sat there and she heard the word of god she heard the wisdom of solomon and she also looked to see how this wisdom is affecting the people's life that's how you judge that god is in the midst of the people now we're not talking about prosperity god will bless us and god will do this for us how is that thing affecting our life how is it changing us praise the lord that's what you should look for is it affecting your life all the half has never yet been told glory be to god are we together all the half has never yet been told why because god kept it to himself daniel saw it a little bit of faith in daniel chapter 12 god told him seal it up because he's kept for the time of the end daniel said i know markel will stand for his people in the in those days now because of everything that the jews were going through you were just saying that they will be wept out of the earth babylon could not wipe them out even hitler could not wipe them out because god kept a portion of the jewish secret to himself how he will restore them and he will make the desert to flourish again he kept that to himself he kept it to himself that's the reason why he kept a portion of your life secret to himself and the only way you will know until you seek it until you seek his face until you seek his face you know the story of a brother branham not born in a religious home and he had this gift from a child seeing visions he was confused until 1947 when he went he told his wife god either answered me oh that would be the end of my life praise the lord and an angel from the presence of the lord said i've come to tell you what god had back concerning your mysterious life that's what the new birth is all about that's what it's all about it's not to make you a church member is to make you sons and daughters of god praise the lord because sometimes you are confused you love god but i mean they are just things that keep bothering you you praying about it you prayed about it and they can't go away and yet those things does not take you far away from god they carry you more in the presence of god oh god help me lord jesus deliver me oh god deliver me praise the lord and sometimes you get confused watch this thing keep happening around my life why why me i'm telling you that half has never yet been told that's why paul says eyes have not seen and years have not heard because the half has never yet been told eyes have not seen in years have not heard what god have installed for these people praise the lord all the world they can see this there the whole christianity you because you suffer you you do this you do that and i mean you get all sorts of things to say about christians but the half has never yet been told glory be to god amen no saw that half of the amber light but john saw the complete light around the throne in the book of revelation he saw the complete light around the throne oh people of god amen let me just read this from the gamma's church edge and then we close here and then the word he has left behind on the printed pages is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he said that his word is life that's what jesus says in john teddy but that is exactly what he is saint john 14 6 he says i'm the way the truth and the life romans 8 9 if any man have not the spirit of christ he he is none of his there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what jesus is he is the word so when a spirit-born spirit fill man in faith takes the word into his heart and place it upon his lips when you take god's word in your heart and place it upon your lip praise the lord thank you brother johnny amen hallelujah a spirit film don't try to reason it that's the problem don't try to figure it out say god said it praise the lord god said it that's the way he said it don't paraphrase it either amen glory be to god say it just like he said it because that word has the power to produce itself when a spiritual man or woman of god take the word of god into their heart and put that same word back on their lips glory be to god amen well that is the same as deity speaking that is the same as almighty god speaking glory be to god you want to speak like deity don't paraphrase god's word you want to speak like deity say what the word says don't don't think about how it would come to pass don't worry about it because deity don't worry deity is in control deity is in control when god said it his word do not go out and return back so when the son of god or the daughter of god put the word of god on don't let your mind to trouble you praise the lord amen that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to god satan cannot stand before a man or a woman that take god at his word praise the lord you you have to remember you are not the challenger it's a battle between god and the devil god in heaven and the devil in hell amen it's a battle between god and the devil you are only telling the devil whose side you are on when you tell him the word of god you are telling him whose side you are standing on don't make it as if to say you and the devil you are in the context you have to know you cannot stand that god he brought something down he brought david down he brought every man down accept the lord jesus christ praise the lord just tell him whose side you are on glory be to god amen that's deity speaking that's deity speaking musicians you can come praise the lord that's deity speaking oh praise the lord oh thank you jesus thank you father thank you almighty god let's put that song up i got one one more valley to cross one more mountain to climb sorry my truth is just so dry praise the lord amen oh people glory be to god amen hallelujah you tell the devil that the half has

part of your life to himself a lie where there is no sickness there is no pain a life where you are young forever he's keeping the best part of himself praise the lord do you see why those sins of all
