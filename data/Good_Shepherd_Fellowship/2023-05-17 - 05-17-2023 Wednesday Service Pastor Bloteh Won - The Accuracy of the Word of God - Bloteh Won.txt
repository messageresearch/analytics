Bibles praise the Lord let's take our Bibles let's go to the book of Hebrew let's go to Hebrew Hebrew chapter 11. Hebrew chapter 11 we want to read from verse 1. Hebrew chapter 11 read from verse 1. now Faith is the substance of things hopeful the evidence of Things Not Seen four by eight the others obtained a good report true faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of God so dead things which are seen were not made of things which do appear praise the Lord let us pray father Lord we want to come for tonight and and just testify lord of the Excellency of your word father I pray that God the service law would be an encouragement to your children and father-in-law we would trust and depend on the leadership of the Holy Spirit tonight we will ask you for altering floor who asks you will go farther that you will bring Eternal truth out of your word something that I was talking feed on Lord we just commit ourselves in your

everything that we see happening around the world to you be the praise to you be the glory and the honor in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen if the Lord bless you you may have your seed once again it's good to be in the house of the Lord and God to to see the grace of God on your faces this evening and uh I want to just uh kind of for testify tonight I want to testify to that I want to uh yeah I would I was studying some time ago and and uh through the message of the rejected King and like I said uh when brother Brandon preached the rejected King when you you follow the message it's uh in in one sense it's easy for for you for us to look at it in and go back to you know uh the the ological view that that is out there and their View you know uh make us to understand the other uh God has always lead his people and uh uh and then he has always been the king of his people ruling his people he told Moses that he wanted to make them a kingdom of Praise And there's that in Exeter but then also God uh uh also make provision that Israel was going to experience different form of leadership so uh [Music] in the book of Samuel it shows the how Israel will get into this form of rejecting that leadership through the prophet and the people we want to be like the rest of every nation and and they will want to have a kink now like we said before uh Jacob promised that the kingship would come out of Judah but yet God was having an appointed time that he was going to bring his people to this place but the people once again like Brad branches man we always are in in haste so the people went ahead of the promise and they wanted a king to be like every other Nation so uh but if you look into the message you will realize that brother Branham emphasis on the rejected King was more in the place of the people rejecting the leadership of God being rejecting the leadership of the Holy Spirit he was applying there to our time you know that we are the the Sheep of his pastures and uh uh God always want us to be under his leadership so while I was I was going through that I came across a familiar testimony let's go to a rejected King I came across a familiar testimony and uh uh uh any and instead in their testimony uh brother Branham says here from the beginning the accuracy of the Holy Spirit she was that were the accuracy kind of for caught my mind it caught my mind so tonight I will I would like to testify it a little bit on the accuracy of the word of God how the word of God is accurate praise the Lord there is no contradiction in God's word amen there is no contradiction in God's promises God is accurate in the things that he does praise the Lord amen if you look here uh in in Hebrew chapter 11 Paul says true faith we understand we understand that this entire word was free by the word of God Amen by God's spoken word the entire word that the the universe and everything you know God is frame it came to Vain by God's word so God's Pocket and here we have it so that the things which are seen were not made by things we should do appear praise the Lord so from there we just we just want to encourage ourselves tonight that we enough we are not following uh uh coding device feeble like people say and or like the Apostle Peter said uh we are following uh uh fulfilled scripture we are following God the god that has spoke his word he's the one that have called us to believe the word that he have spoken praise the Lord so let's just look into their testimony again like brother Branham will say there are a few of them here that's that's what I want for us to look into this is a Wednesday night and that's all we just want to encourage ourselves together the accuracy of the Holy Spirit tell them the lady who she was what her name what her name was what she's done how she got hurt as a little girl told her the city she was from and all about it and when it went to uh regard her name a cohort mess and she was a middle-aged woman but she never been married just the accuracy of the Holy Spirit how it does that praise the Lord amen but branham's talking about and we know that that accuracy of the Holy Spirit was the gift of the sermon that was on the prophet amen and then and how when the prophet entered that China he would call people by their name and tell them their addresses and where they were from and even tell them things you know of their past when they were little and all that in Broad branches even that God who was so regarded and that God will refer to this young woman as Miss he says that just the accuracy of the Holy Ghost how he does them then this morning in the interview I suppose be a year uh it's a a couple missionary they are worse somewhere in the meeting I didn't get their names down here but they were in the interview this me this morning and said about some time ago they were in one of the meeting and the lady was suffering tremendously with something and her husband also and said it told her who she was and what she was suffering when told her husband what was wrong with him and all about the things that did done in life that he did done in their life and were they are calling and where their calling was and they was going to minister to people that wall little caps on their head which was Jewish and they were going overseas and everything would take place and she said everything just exactly the way it was was right praise the Lord amen now as as we will read these few quotes many of them will go in this same direction but what I'm what I'm I'm believing God that the law will be able to help us to grab tonight is that the same God that that could discern those people needs and could be very accurate with their names and the need in their life in your brother Branham saying that these people were missionaries and in the vision he told them where they were traveling to and even the people they were traveling to their same God that was so accurate to tell them their needs he's here tonight and he knows your need yes praise the Lord it is not just to read about what the law did in the life of brother Branham to lift the uh uh uh the prophet brother Branham abnormal but it is also to let us to know that that's in God is here tonight the same God of accuracy praise the Lord so if we look at that in the light of God's word then we know that with God there is no mistake with our life he knows where we are he knows who we are he knows what we are dealing with are we together praise the Lord that's what I want for us to get out of here tonight by the help of the Lord and share them coming back she did taking second and and said the doctors wanted to operate on her for some kind of attack in uh the god or something and she she wanted and we wanted to operate immediately but she come back if I get this story right and said she prayed Lord Oh Lord I'm going over she did get one off the magazine where it was to be and she said Lord last night I was up there I got a card number three please Lord let me have let me let me have card number three again praise the Lord and say the Holy Spirit seems to tell her she was a Christian uh I think formerly and Lutheran and a nurse out of the hospital and and said the Lord told her you will have card number three say about night when my son came to give to God so uh it will be double when we are calling the meetings that no one will know Billy has to get up before the crowd and take the class and mix them all up together so the people will know then another thing no one knows where we are going to stop the prayer line I come in in uh wherever the Holy Spirit lead me I start from there so he said he got up makes makes up the card and and come down she said uh I won one he he handed handed it to her and just passed on she looked on it it was 98. I believe or 97 I believe he said 97 I think it was And she said Oh Lord you promised me number three and now you give me 97. or something 97. I think 97 you gave me 97 and said now you promised me number three and said she began weeping and she didn't know what to do said I would I will never be because until 97. for the time she was in I might have started from one theater that night coming to the platform said I look over I look out over the audience rear straining said I'm going to start tonight from 100 and come backwards praise the Lord number three is that lady in the building oh yeah she's right in front of me all Lord bless you Sister the holy spirit always right isn't he amen the Lord bless you well that's fine you see when the Holy Spirit promised you anything if it's the Holy Spirit as he's you will get it praise the Lord here is this woman praying that and going you know to the meeting and now uh you know and believing that God told her she will have 93 then Billy Paul come and give out the cotton and gave her the uh I mean she will have number three and give her the card number 97. when God in his Divine wisdom had the prophets to start from hundred going back and she still fell on 93. praise the Lord amen you see we are in such our our present life is in such a shadow and as we read the word of God and and we get about the things that God has done and God is doing it is just like seeing the light coming in the toner amen praise the Lord there is there is just a lot of things about what we deal with in everything you know is is just odd about a shot brother Brahm talks here in the message the handwriting on the wall he said then the lord gave him a dream and it troubled him he talking about King Nebuchadnezzar and when he did he saw a great image and we are well acquainted with the image and notice the accuracy of God's internal word now brother Brandon while she read this down you're going to see that brother Branham is going to take this talking about the accuracy of God's internal word and what he's going to address here is that everything that we are experiencing as political turmer as economic turmer every condition that the present word is in God addressed in Nebuchadnezzar dream the accuracy of God's internal word praise the Lord there's a big thing that is playing on the international scene Barbarian told us of different curtains he spoke about the iron curtains and the baboon curtains and the purple curtains you know uh uh and and that's that's there there are some big things that are playing on the international scene and and when you look closely in the word you know that everything that God said will come to pass just as it's supposed to be praise the Lord the prophet of God says it will come to pass that uh uh the U.S dollar with worth nothing he says because the country has gone broke now there is a big thing that is playing out there because uh uh uh uh uh with with with the alliance of of China and uh uh in in Russia and now all of these uh uh uh big Islamic countries that have been controlling or for many years are all trying to turn down to to China for business praise the Lord and if that should ever happen the U.S currency will lose its value because brother Brown said one time we were on a gold standard we had enough gold to back up the currency but Rome has taken all the gold of America praise the Lord and everything is addressed right here in that dream that God gave to Nebuchadnezzar the accuracy of God's word are we together praise the Lord now if the word of God from hundreds of years that God will give a Babylonian King a dream and that dream will speak of every Gentile Kingdom it will even speak of a spiritual Kingdom which is a stone cut out of the mountain with our man's hand praise the Lord if thou word of the Lord we address things just like it have been happening All Through the Ages can the word of God that we sit on them the preaching of the word the reading of the word the hearing of of the voice of God's prophet can it address the situation in our lives surely he can praise the Lord what I'm trying to do tonight is to is to is to show us how much confidence we need to have in the word of God praise the Lord brother Branham says nothing the accuracy of God's internal word came Nebuchadnezzar saying an image with a golden head and and the breast was here was Savor and the thought of Bryce and the feet was iron and Clay now notice how those kingdoms listen to the way he said it here he said the softest material is gold amen the softer material is gold now what he's going to describe we will read it he says the softer material is gold the necks come in his father then their savior the next is bride and the hardest of all of them is iron iron is the hardest and notice how the Gentile world will start it will start so soft then just keep getting harder and harder and harder and how to tell if finally went out into a clay and iron mix and each one of those Kingdom praise the Lord not only the politics of this Kingdom even the religious condition the spiritual condition of the word it keeps getting harder from God to savor to Bryce then to iron the accuracy of God's word are we together now I think 2500 years ago a single person that purpose in their heart that they will serve the Lord and will not defy themselves foretold this they to the DOT and that was done to you amen amen got a man who purpose in his heart to not Define himself and God will deal with him and he will speak he fought told this day to the dead and every other age coming down perfectly how the Babylon the kingdom was taken away then the meeting in persons and faking they are over and Grace taking their over and Rome took it over and broke and broke into uh both feet which is easting and Western Rome and how that in Rome they did have two different churches among the Gentiles and and and and and and one will be the Catholic and the other will be the Protestant clay and iron the iron of the Roman Catholic church and the clay of the Protestant how how the Woody mixed together but who linger them sees one marrying into the other trying to break the power of one just perfectly exactly how God said it will take place praise the Lord amen amen when it seems like everything is getting is is getting out of order getting out of control we can still trust the word of God the word of God spoke about the day that we are living praise the Lord Hallelujah that's the god that we have to deal with and that has come to pass just as perfect as it could come to pass and every other promise of God's word will come to pass just as perfect as that was something will be going home to Glory someday Jesus is coming praise the Lord the word spoke about a body change amen if if if the Dream came into Nebuchadnezzar show all the changes in the image from the head of gold to the to the breast of of Savior and we and we realized all of those changes and even the the word in general the Gentile word in general have experienced it from from from from the softness of God to to the take and that the toughness of iron if if the entire word can be able to experience that that was foretold by God's word how much more about the promise of God that you shall be changed your body shall be changed amen and run around will say even the word now is changing the atoms of your body as you receive the word it's beginning to change you praise the Lord God's word is accurate God's word is truth God word is powerful praise the Lord his word is powerful he holds the power of the word in his hands brother said the testimony of a true Witness he said what struck those Prophets what inspired him that perfect accuracy not only that but the prophets to what he would do the prophet even saw he born where he will be born and how he will be born not and Ordinary Baby just a baby born of some woman he said he will be born a mysterious way he will be born of a virgin a virgin shall conceive praise the Lord that's ours are your prophecy yeah amen he spoke the word a virgin shall conceive glory be to God and like brother Branham says for that 700 years that one word have many interpretations people try to interpret how will it happen maybe she'll be a virgin until she get married and she'll have a child they explain it their own way but God said what he meant and he brought his word to pass just exactly what was in his mind it was going to be the seed of a woman [Music] accuracy God's word and that same word that said a virgin shall conceive that same word says that there will be a bride amen amen there will be a bride praise the Lord so you see this uh is the uh uh we we we we have been brought forth by the word and it's not you believing God's word that makes it to to fulfill amen but God brings you to believe his word because his word he will fulfill his word when he made a promise he would bring it to pass so the word bring us forth to be able to receive the Fulfillment amen amen because heaven and earth will pass away but not one drug of God's word we ever pass away praise the Lord Brothers Prophet what inspired him that a prophet will prophesy he will name the place in birth to him out of Judea praise the Lord amen and all of these men that are that are that are are giving all of these prophecies concerning the Messiah it's not like they are sitting down around the round table and and this one is giving I I you know I say best to hand if this one says uh uh a virgin shall come see no hundreds of years apart but when it came to the Fulfillment their prophecy was dovetailing one another exactly toward the point why because the intelligence of God is behind his word praise the Lord amen since we can believe the word of God praise the Lord because God's word is truth Hallelujah brother Branham saves this bride will be another she will write another book of Arts she's the continuation of the book of Acts praise the Lord so I believe that we can we can have a New Testament Church I believe that we can have we can still have New Testament believers yes sir no matter with all the the changes that are going on in the word you know and and the clouds of spirit that we are about to remember God worst Ensure are we together a virgin shall conceive one who struck a a mortar man to make him see that hundreds of years before it happened accurate exactly on the line talk about testimony of a Supreme Being a living God not only that but told where he will be born and how he will be born praise the Lord we have said that before God is not in our time he's not in our time zone right amen amen he's not in our time zone you know the scripture says Hebrew 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but do you realize that that yesterday is not God's yesterday because God don't have a yesterday he's ever present he don't have a past God don't have a past praise the Lord amen now this is the way that brother Branham explain it he says what God did for Men Yesterday he can do the same today so is God's dealing with men it is not God that has said yesterday right with God he's ever present he's ever present he's out of our time zone yes that's the reason why his word can be accurate just like I said if it is like uh uh you go down to the fair and and and and and everybody is is marching you are standing at the street corner you can only see the troop as they come by the guy that is on top of the the the the House Top he's on top of the roof of the house he can see the beginning of the troop he can see the end so when he tells you the group that are coming there they are wearing red you can believe him because you and I see them until they come around the corner but he can see them when they begin praise the Lord he know where the parade started from he nowhere is going to end because he's above the the roof at the top of the house amen we are just at a certain Corner in our dispensation God is completely out of our time zone praise the Lord that's why we can be living that's why we can trust him that's why we can hold to his word because we know his world will never fail the word of God will never fail it's not only that it will come to pass but it's accurate yes he's never late he's always on time no man praise the Lord if we can only learn to rest in debt if we can just only learn to rest in that that God is always on time Hallelujah he's always on time he's exact to the DOT praise the Lord amen now why would God do this that a woman will pray and believe in her heart that God spoke to her that you would get number three praise the Lord why would God do it he's doing it for you and myself right to be able to raise our faith amen amen because 97 brother Branham said she said I know I will never be called right then her faith has dropped amen we get we get on fire we get so serious and then a wind just coming past the Lord that just it shows how sometimes we are just so much in ourself we are so much in ourselves we are looking for self-edication we are looking for self-pleasing so when our boat is Rock a little bit then it looks like maybe the vision was not correct sure then our minds start going in thousand different direction praise the Lord no matter what happens you have to believe no matter what happens God word [Music] feel just exactly as he said [Music] praise the Lord he told his disciples he said there are some among you that will not taste it praise the Lord if God says they are there there are some that will now taste death in the twinkling of an eye they will have a body change it's good it's going to happen praise the Lord Brother man said in the message uh uh uh taking science with Jesus he said that is the reason why he says the Old Testament prophet and and the Saints the Apostle he says when they spoke about the promise of God they never put it in the future they spoke about it as it was happening in their day praise the Lord now brother Branham says uh even though in God time spent or this perception we can see that God was Worthy on the time of the Gentiles and all of that he said but when Paul spoke about the Rapture he said we that are alive amen the prophet said God Inspire His prophets to speak about his word in the present tense because God is ever present amen hallelujah God is ever present Hallelujah now so the prophet said even though they preach about the Rapture they preach about the coming of the Lord it never happened in their time but they went to the ground with an anticipation he said it is that same thing that will wake them up in the coming of the Lord [Music] because they are even though their body die but they are fed never die amen praise the Lord so brother bring him says if God promised to to to give you anything you can believe it that you going to receive it today he says if you don't receive it today then get excited that it will be tomorrow if it does not happen it must not why what's that we we regret We Get Wicked but knowing the god that we serve every day our excitement of what God promised us must increase that if he never did it today it will be tomorrow if you don't have to answer is the next day [Music] that's what faith must do in The Believer it must make us excited Hallelujah but we get so much capture in the spirit that we live when it does not happen it looks like we stopped talking about it because it looks like it's not an embarrassment you're talking this thing too much and it's not happening praise the Lord amen and pretty much now we we we we we lost the excitement of the promise amen we lost it but no when the promise of when God's promise is given a must make us excited Hallelujah amen if God promised that he's going to heal you you must be excited about it because as far as God is concerned it's already done Hallelujah man praise the Lord as far as he's concerned is already done that's how accurate God's word is praise the Lord amen that's how accurate every promise of God is glory be to God this is just to encourage you tonight brother Branham says a virgin shall conceive what will struck a mortar man to make him see that hundreds of years before it happened their fell in accurate exactly told the line talk about the testimony of a Supreme Being a living God not only that but tall word he will be born and how he will be born toward what the word who said about him told the various signs and things that will follow him to prove he was Messiah prove that he will be rejected and even in the spirit groaning his words from the cross hundreds of years before he was born the accuracy the Perfection of those Prophets they were men of like passion but when it came to the world that God gave them it was accurate praise the Lord when it came to the world that God gave them praise the Lord it was accurate to the doctor Hallelujah as men they are they are humans now that was I was listening to blood Brown this morning I don't have this in my notes but this talk just came to my mind so I will read this to you it is I he said I was listening and it blessed me so much this morning he said listen my brothers sisters maybe our last time meeting no one there's no one in the world will ever know what I went through that's right you can't explain it you can't explain God and you sit in a meeting not in the air but many times you talk a few meaning to find yes a Critic over here years at doubt or over a year is one suspicious over here years one a devil possessed sitting over there he says you feel they're coming against you like a beast yeah brother Brandon is describing what he's dealing with in the meetings okay he said you see all of these people because I mean you just you think about it I mean we we we we are humans unless God gave you the grace to rise above your human weakness praise the Lord you I mean you you will you you have some question in your mind how is how is this man calling people names foreign there goes a Godless sin sitting there trying to find God yes another one is wandering and doubting and yes a little baby dying years one across eye yes a dad is sitting here with cancer and then all that by the thousand meeting you at once praise the Lord all there by a thousand meeting you at once he says here you don't realize how it tears you to pieces glory be to God amen and we don't we don't even we don't even hardly have 100 people in church so we we just have a we have a tie of what brother Brandon was dealing with glory be to God because the devil tried to find his way amen either he makes a person change their world I'm the one they are talking to or a person get completely distracted out of the service they are just they are just uh you know looking at somebody close or you know looking at something yes and you know and all of those things all of those spirits he says adhere you to pieces now this is what broke my heart and make me to to capture this he says and just think Satan waiting for one little crook word one little word that you would just say and it will throw the people off see he called the wrong name see he I mean that's in verse five he said verse 4. Satan waiting for just one word [Music] some word see and knowing that you are a human vertebraham said knowing that you are a human I'm a human being I have all of these thousands of spirits coming to me people are in need people are there to criticize people are suspicious right the devil have his forces Warren against the meeting he says and Nuri that I'm a human being I can make mistake I can mispronounce a word norin I'm a human being that just broke my heart this morning that just broke my heart for people that have gone on this Rabbit Trail to look for in an error they can find around the message and not counting the hundreds of lives that was blessed it was not the man William Brown and there was one called word says we will send you Elijah the prophet praise the Lord it was not the man William brought him it was God's word the accuracy of God's word God said I will send you Elijah the prophet and God was accurate to the point praise the Lord it is not what are you believe it or not that make God's word truth God vindicate his own word of the hundreds of lives that was affected me praise the Lord of the hundreds of life they have come to realize that there is a living God Amen that we can hold to biblical principle in the mess of a confused word we can still try to keep decency in the church because God said I will Resort the faith of the Apostles amen hallelujah amen what part of Brandon says Nori I'm a human being where people take that into consideration well they take it into consideration that this man he had a wife he had children he was not an angel that just came from Heaven Come and gave his message and go back to heaven right nor in that you are a human being you have to completely Rely Upon Jesus Christ amen just completely throw your life to him praise the Lord And yet when you do all of that you are misunderstood praise the Lord yet when you do all of that you you miss understood so you see it was not brother Baron says the accuracy their perfection of those prophets now one word did they speak about him but what come to pass praise the Lord the last seven prophecy giving of him was answered in the last seven hours on the cross for every word to be fulfilled all my inspiration said his balls will not be broken and the Roma and was going to break the teeth bones he did it to the tool but when he came to Jesus because there was an eternal word an accurate word that would not be broken he put the hammer down and he pick up a spear and he praise the Lord it's the same word that says my angels I ain't come about you praise the lord it's not a fake promise it's a true Palace you can believe it that the angels of God and he come about you and because we believe that we want to keep their presence so we live a decent life you live a consecrated life you don't want to greet the oppression you want to keep their presence amen amen the accuracy of those Prophets yeah even the last seven prophecy happen in the last few hours of Jesus life what does he speak a supreme intelligence brother Brandon said a supreme intelligence a washing those men and when it comes to the message it was not William Branham no a man with a poor seventh grade education will not bring to us the man of God right it was God okay that's the reason why the best we can do is to witness to you we can force this thing down your throat God has to reveal it to you God have to make it real to you a supreme intelligence and watching those men those men were just men like you and I but they were inspired by a Supreme Being which was giving testimony that we in this generation in the generation to come and all the generation between them between them and year who look upon the word and know that they are truth it's a testimony that the word of God is accurate praise the lord it's a testimony that the word of God is accurate praise the Lord are we together amen it's a testimony that the word of God is accurate and and if there's not
