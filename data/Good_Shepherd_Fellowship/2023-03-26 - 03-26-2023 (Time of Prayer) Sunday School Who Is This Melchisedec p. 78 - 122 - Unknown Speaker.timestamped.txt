[0:43] and then when this robe of flesh is
[0:46] dropped
[0:48] there is a natural body theophany a body
[0:52] not Maple that has neither born of a
[0:54] woman that we go to
[0:58] then that body returns back it picks up
[1:01] the glorified body that's the reason
[1:03] Jesus went to hell when he died it
[1:06] preached to the souls that were in
[1:07] prison
[1:11] turn back into that theophany
[1:16] oh marbles thank God
[1:21] II Corinthians 5 1. if this Earthly body
[1:24] be dissolved this Earthly Tabernacle we
[1:27] have another one
[1:28] see we have bypassed that to come
[1:31] straight from God the attribute to be
[1:34] flesh to be tempted and trusted by sin
[1:37] like Adam did
[1:40] but when tested obvious word
[1:44] is over
[1:46] then we are taken up to this body that
[1:50] was prepared for us before the
[1:51] foundation of the world it is the word
[1:54] there that we skip to come right around
[1:57] here to be tempted and tested if we to
[2:00] come through that there have been no
[2:01] temptation we had note all things
[2:04] that's reason Jesus note all things
[2:07] because he was worried before he was
[2:09] flesh
[2:11] then we become the word here we are Farm
[2:16] to the word image
[2:19] to be a partaker of the word feed on the
[2:23] word
[2:24] by being predestinated since the
[2:27] beginning
[2:28] you see that little spark of life that
[2:31] you had in you from the beginning when
[2:32] you started your journey many of you can
[2:34] remember it you joined this church and
[2:36] joined that church and try this and that
[2:38] nothing's satisfying right but one day
[2:42] you just recognized it
[2:45] right the other night I was teaching
[2:48] somewhere are things out in California
[2:50] or Arizona about I believe I've told a
[2:55] little story here about the man setting
[2:57] to him had an eagle 800.
[2:59] and when that eagle passed out he's the
[3:01] funniest looking bird them chicken's
[3:03] ever seen
[3:04] but he walked around he was the he was
[3:07] the ugly one among them because he just
[3:09] couldn't understand how that hand will
[3:11] cluck and scratch on that manure pile
[3:12] and eat he couldn't get the idea
[3:14] she'd say come on over and feast honey
[3:16] but he was the eagle
[3:20] you just didn't eat like that
[3:22] it wasn't his food
[3:25] so she gets grasshopper some a lot more
[3:27] you know and call the little chickens
[3:29] and all them little chickens that go
[3:30] along clock along and eat but the little
[3:32] Eagle just couldn't do it it didn't
[3:35] didn't look right to him
[3:37] so one day is mammy come hunting
[3:41] and he's near that hand Club he tries
[3:43] best to cook but he couldn't do it
[3:46] he tried to cheat like a chicken but he
[3:48] couldn't do it
[3:49] see he was an eagle
[3:51] he to start with he was the eagle he was
[3:54] just hatched under a hen
[3:57] that's like some church member
[4:00] ever that's about the way it is about
[4:02] when I was setting is right
[4:05] but one day his man he flew over and she
[4:08] screamed
[4:10] he recognized it
[4:15] why was the eagle to begin with
[4:19] amen that's the way it is with the
[4:20] gospel of the word the power of Jesus
[4:23] Christ
[4:23] when a man
[4:25] has been predestinated to eternal life
[4:29] he hears that true ring Scream Of God
[4:31] nothing can keep him from it the church
[4:35] if I say days of Miracles just passed
[4:36] stand here to eat this and stand here
[4:38] and eat that that barnyard stuff won't
[4:40] do for him anymore
[4:42] he's gone
[4:44] all things are possible he gets off the
[4:47] ground that's why I imagine any
[4:49] Christians in any King get their feet
[4:50] off the ground
[4:52] the old man he said Son jump you're an
[4:55] eagle come up here where I am
[4:57] he said Mom I never jumped in my life
[4:59] she said when you jump your ego to begin
[5:01] with you're not a chicken
[5:03] so he made his first jump and flopped
[5:05] his wings didn't do too good but he got
[5:07] off the ground
[5:09] that's why we do we accept God by Faith
[5:13] by the written word
[5:15] there's something in there is that
[5:17] eternal life you were predestinated to
[5:19] it
[5:20] his Grandpa and Grandma were Eagles he
[5:23] was the eagle all the way back
[5:25] Eagle don't mix with other things
[5:29] he's not a hybrid at all he's an eagle
[5:33] then after you recognize the very word
[5:36] of God was evil food
[5:39] then you left the other thing
[5:42] you have then been formed into the
[5:44] living image of the Living God you heard
[5:48] from your theophany if this Earthly body
[5:51] be dissolved we have one waiting
[5:54] say is that right brother Branham all
[5:56] right let's take a couple of eagles and
[5:58] look at him for a few minutes
[5:59] that was the name man named Moses
[6:02] everyone knows that a prophets called
[6:04] The Eagle
[6:05] in the Bible
[6:06] there was a prophet named Moses
[6:09] and one day God called him and what let
[6:12] him go over the land and he died on a
[6:14] rock the Angels took him away and buried
[6:17] him
[6:17] that was another man an eagle didn't
[6:19] even have to die
[6:21] he's walked across Jordan God sent a
[6:24] chair down and this robe of Flesh he
[6:26] dropped and rise and caught the
[6:28] Everlasting prize
[6:30] 800 years later
[6:35] 800 years later on my Transfiguration
[6:39] here stood those two men Moses body had
[6:43] been rotten for hundreds of years but
[6:46] yeah he was in such a form to even Peter
[6:50] James and John recognized it
[6:52] Amen to this Earthly Tabernacle be
[6:55] dissolved if you're an attribute of God
[6:57] express your own Earth you've got a body
[6:59] weight and if you leave this world
[7:02] the only one standing on Mount
[7:03] Transfiguration in their theophany for
[7:07] they were prophets to whom the word came
[7:09] to
[7:10] also let us notice another prophet
[7:14] one time
[7:15] by the name of Samuel he was a great man
[7:19] he taught Israel told him he shouldn't
[7:21] have a king he said if I ever said one
[7:24] thing to you in the name of the Lord
[7:25] will I come to pass
[7:27] they said no everything you've always
[7:29] said in the name of the Lord come to
[7:30] pass
[7:31] he was a prophet and he died
[7:34] about three or four years later the king
[7:36] got in trouble that before the blood of
[7:39] Jesus Christ was ever shed he was in
[7:42] Paradise and a witch of hindrance Paul
[7:47] for somebody to come and console Saul
[7:50] and when the witch saw him standing up
[7:52] she said I see God raising up out of the
[7:55] Earth
[7:56] and after the man had been dead buried
[8:00] and rotted in the grave
[8:02] here he was standing there in that cave
[8:06] with his prophet's robes on I'm still a
[8:10] prophet
[8:14] or he said why did you call me out of my
[8:17] rest see you become an enemy to God once
[8:20] you prophesy tomorrow
[8:23] night but this time you will be with me
[8:27] he was still a prophet though he was
[8:30] gone from this body see if he come here
[8:32] and was part of that word
[8:35] and he entered from the Fleshlight back
[8:38] into the body that had been prepared for
[8:40] him before the foundation of the world
[8:42] he entered into the theophany which was
[8:45] the word
[8:47] you get it that's where all believers go
[8:50] when we turn from here
[8:53] then in that form
[8:55] the bail ban is lifted you see you are
[8:59] the word also when you enter into there
[9:02] as a little babies I said a while ago
[9:04] now I noticed praise God for these
[9:08] opening seals in my prayer then know
[9:10] these things now the true revelation
[9:13] of Melchizedek comes into view
[9:18] was he was God the word before he became
[9:22] flesh
[9:24] God the word because he had to be no one
[9:28] else could be immortal like him
[9:33] see I had father and mother
[9:36] you did too
[9:37] Jesus had father and mother
[9:41] but this man had no father or had no
[9:45] mother
[9:46] Jesus had a time he started this man
[9:49] didn't
[9:53] Jesus gave his life this man couldn't
[9:55] because he was alive
[9:58] it's a self-same man all the time I hope
[10:01] God reveals it to you
[10:04] the self-sane person all the time
[10:07] notice his title
[10:09] king of righteousness now Hebrews 7 2
[10:12] King of righteousness
[10:15] and King
[10:44] now the true revelation of
[10:47] Melchizedek comes into view
[10:51] well he was God the word before he
[10:55] became flesh
[10:57] God the word because he had to be no one
[11:02] else could be immortal like him
[11:06] see I had father and mother
[11:09] you did too
[11:11] Jesus had father and mother
[11:14] but this man had no father or had no
[11:18] mother
[11:20] Jesus had a time he started this man
[11:23] didn't
[11:26] Jesus gave his life this man couldn't
[11:28] because he was alive
[11:31] it's a self-same man all the time I hope
[11:35] God reveals it to you
[11:38] the self-sane person all the time
[11:41] notice his title
[11:43] king of righteousness now Hebrews 7 2
[11:46] King of righteousness
[11:48] and King
[11:50] a peace
[11:52] these two kings a what Hebrews 7 2
[11:57] of righteousness
[11:59] also the king of Peace he's two kings
[12:02] there
[12:03] now since he has come in the flesh
[12:08] and received his body up in Revelations
[12:11] 21 16 he's called the king of kings
[12:16] he's all three of them together
[12:20] see King God King theophany King Jesus
[12:24] he's the king of kings it's all matches
[12:28] like soul body and spirit all comes to
[12:31] make one also he is the Father which was
[12:34] the first Son and Holy Ghost
[12:37] the spirit king of righteousness the
[12:41] spirit attribute theophany king of
[12:45] of
[12:46] um
[12:47] Peace theophany and in flesh he was King
[12:51] of Kings
[13:15] when the theophany Moses seen him Exodus
[13:19] 33 2 he was a theophany Moses wanted to
[13:24] see God he'd heard his voice heard him
[13:26] talk to him see him in a bush there it
[13:28] was a big Pillar of Fire and he said who
[13:31] are you I want to know who you are Moses
[13:33] said if you let me see you I would like
[13:36] to see your face he said no man can't
[13:38] see my face
[13:40] he said I'll put my hand over your eyes
[13:43] and I'll pass by and you can see my back
[13:45] but not my face
[13:48] see
[13:49] and when he did it was the back of a man
[13:52] it was theophany
[13:54] then the word that come to Moses I am
[13:59] that was the word
[14:02] the word came to Moses in the form of a
[14:05] pillar firing of burning bush the I am
[14:09] as the word from the theology from the
[14:12] theophany rather excuse me he came to
[14:15] Abraham as a man under the oak tree now
[14:18] look at there there came a man to
[14:21] Abraham three of them and sat down under
[14:24] an oak tree
[14:25] three of them
[14:27] I noticed
[14:29] after he talked to Abraham
[14:33] why did he come Abraham being the one
[14:36] with the promise and the message of the
[14:40] coming son and also he was God's word
[14:44] prophet
[14:46] that was trusting God's word calling
[14:48] anything contrary as though it wasn't
[14:52] see how perfect the word is the word
[14:55] came to the prophet
[14:57] see there was God in a theophany
[15:01] and the Bible said the word comes to the
[15:04] prophet
[15:05] and here was the the word in the
[15:09] theophany now you say was that God
[15:11] Abraham said it was
[15:14] he said his name was he called him
[15:16] Elohim
[15:17] now Genesis 1 you find out
[15:20] in the beginning Elohim create the
[15:22] heavens Earth and Genesis 18 we find out
[15:25] that Abraham called this person that sat
[15:29] there and talked to him
[15:32] and could tell him the secrets of his
[15:34] heart tell him what Sarah was thinking
[15:36] behind him Abraham said it is Elohim
[15:41] is in a theophany form
[15:44] you get it
[15:45] notice
[15:48] after how we find out that he was then
[15:51] in the theophany for him he called him
[15:53] Lord God Elohim now in Genesis 18 we
[15:57] find that that is truth
[15:59] now notice
[16:01] Abraham there was three of them together
[16:05] but when Abraham met the three he said
[16:09] my Lord
[16:11] but when locked down in Sodom two of
[16:15] them went down there and lot saw two of
[16:17] them coming and he said my lords
[16:21] see what was the matter the first place
[16:24] lot was not a prophet
[16:28] right
[16:29] or neither was it the messenger
[16:33] of the hour so he didn't have any
[16:36] revelation of him
[16:38] it's exactly right lot to call him Lords
[16:42] a dozen of him he could still set large
[16:44] but no matter how many Abraham saw it
[16:47] was still one Lord
[16:51] there is God this is an El Cassidy
[16:54] notice after the battle was over
[16:57] Melchizedek served his Victorious child
[17:01] communion
[17:03] think of that
[17:05] part of himself now we want to see here
[17:08] and type here is in view the communion
[17:11] after the battle he gave of himself
[17:14] because the communion is part of Christ
[17:18] and after the struggle is over after
[17:21] you've done got yourself whipped out
[17:23] that's when you for take of Christ
[17:27] become part of this being
[17:30] you get it Jacob wrestled all night and
[17:34] wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed
[17:36] him right battle for life and after the
[17:41] battle is over then God gives you of
[17:45] himself
[17:46] that is this true communion
[17:50] the little bread and wafer just
[17:51] represents it you shouldn't take it
[17:53] unless you've wrestled it out and become
[17:55] part of God remember
[17:58] at this time the communion had never
[18:01] been instituted
[18:03] not until before the death of Jesus
[18:06] Christ
[18:07] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[18:09] years later amen but Melchizedek after
[18:13] his child Abraham had won the victory
[18:16] Melchizedek met him and gave him wine
[18:20] and bread amen
[18:22] showing that after this Earthly battle
[18:25] is over we will meet him in the heavens
[18:28] and take the community together it'll be
[18:30] the wedding supper amen
[18:32] amen I will not preach them or the vine
[18:34] or eat the fruit until I eat it and
[18:36] drink it with you and knew in my
[18:37] father's Kingdom
[18:38] is that right
[18:40] notice again
[18:43] Melchizedek went to meet Abraham before
[18:46] he got back home
[18:49] what a beautiful type here we have
[18:52] Melchizedek meaning Abraham before he
[18:56] got back home after the battle
[18:59] we meet Jesus in the air before we get
[19:02] home
[19:03] that's right II Thessalonians tells us
[19:07] that
[19:08] for we meeting in the air a beautiful
[19:11] type of Rebecca meeting Isaac in the
[19:14] field in the cool of the day
[19:16] we meet him in the air II Thessalonians
[19:19] tells us so far we wish alive and remain
[19:21] shall not prevent or hinder those which
[19:23] are asleep for the trumpet of God shall
[19:25] sound the dead in Christ shall rise
[19:27] first we wish alive and remain shall be
[19:29] caught up together with them to meet the
[19:31] Lord in the air
[19:33] Perfect all these times
[19:36] therefore the theophany if you have died
[19:40] and enter into that theophany
[19:43] what happens the theophany comes to the
[19:46] Earth to pick up the redeemed body
[19:50] and if you're here in the air you take
[19:52] the body to meet the theophany
[19:55] their yarn caught up and go to meet the
[19:58] Lord in the air
[19:59] who is this Melchizedek but God now we
[20:03] see here plainly the complete secret of
[20:07] our lives in Journey and death and where
[20:10] we go after we die
[20:12] also predestination is in plain view
[20:16] here at least as we teach this closely
[20:20] the stages of
[20:23] are the Eternal purpose
[20:26] he had in his secret
[20:29] has now been revealed notice there is
[20:33] still three stages to Perfection just
[20:36] like he redeems the world same way he
[20:39] redeems his church he redeems the people
[20:40] in three stages
[20:42] now look first is justification
[20:47] like Luther preach second
[20:50] sanctification like Wesley preached
[20:52] third baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[20:55] right then comes the rapture
[20:59] now the world how do you redeem the
[21:01] world the first what he did when it's
[21:04] sin he washed it off and water baptism
[21:08] that's right then he dropped his blood
[21:10] up on it from the cross and Sanctified
[21:12] it and called it his own
[21:14] then what does he do as he
[21:17] tore all the world out of you and
[21:20] renovated the whole thing by the fiery
[21:22] baptism the Holy Ghost he also will
[21:24] renovate the world
[21:26] and it'll be burnt over with fire
[21:29] ain't plans ever germ from millions of
[21:32] miles high everything will be cleaned
[21:34] off and then there is a new Heaven and a
[21:36] new Earth just like you are a new
[21:38] creature in Christ Jesus when the Holy
[21:40] Spirit takes a hold of you
[21:43] there you are
[21:45] the whole thing's just as plain as it
[21:47] can be everything's in three the natural
[21:49] verse in three
[21:51] what's the first thing that happens to
[21:52] the woman having a baby what breaks
[21:54] first water
[21:56] what breaks next blood
[21:59] what's the next process like
[22:02] water blood spirit what happens to the
[22:04] plane rocks what's the first thing stop
[22:07] what's the next possible what's the next
[22:09] shove then the green
[22:12] comes out of that just the three stages
[22:14] of it till it gets to the green that's
[22:16] exactly God vindicates that's always
[22:19] been right God vindicates it to be the
[22:21] truth show plainly the predestinated
[22:24] is the only one that's considered in
[22:27] Redemption
[22:29] did you get it let me say that again the
[22:33] predestinated
[22:35] is the only one that's considered in
[22:38] Redemption people might be making like
[22:40] think they are but the real Redemption
[22:43] is those that are predestinated because
[22:46] the very word redeem needs to bring back
[22:50] man
[22:52] amen is that right the redeem is
[22:56] something to redeem anything is bring it
[22:59] back to its original place
[23:01] Hallelujah
[23:03] so it's only the predestinate it will be
[23:06] brought back because others didn't come
[23:08] from there
[23:10] see bring back
[23:12] being Eternal with him at the beginning
[23:16] the eternal life that you had is thought
[23:18] of what you was only he wanted you to he
[23:22] wanted me to stand the pulpit say he
[23:24] wants you to set the seat tonight
[23:26] then we are serving his eternal purpose
[23:30] and the one that left home only come to
[23:33] the Earth to serve his purpose
[23:37] is that right
[23:38] all right then after it's finished it's
[23:41] brought back
[23:43] in a glorified State it's mature and
[23:47] brought back again no wonder Paul could
[23:49] say when there is still in the block to
[23:51] chop his head off he said oh death where
[23:54] is your sting amen oh great worries your
[23:56] Victory but thanks be to God who gives
[24:00] us the victory okay
[24:01] he said death tell me where you can make
[24:04] me harder
[24:07] breathe Tell Me How You Gonna Hold Me
[24:09] for I am a possessor of eternal life
[24:13] amen hallelujah you recognize it
[24:17] death hell grave nothing could hold you
[24:21] and nothing can hurt us
[24:24] God eternal life
[24:26] he realized he was blessed with eternal
[24:29] life
[24:30] just like a little Dew Drop
[24:33] if I understand it I don't know too much
[24:36] about chemistry but it must be that it's
[24:39] uh the congelling of humidity or
[24:42] atmosphere and when the night gets cold
[24:45] and dark it falls from the heavens and
[24:48] drops upon the ground
[24:49] it fell from somewhere
[24:52] but the next morning before the sun
