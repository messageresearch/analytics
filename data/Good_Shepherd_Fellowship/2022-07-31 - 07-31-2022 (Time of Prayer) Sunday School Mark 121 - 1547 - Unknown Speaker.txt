[Music] and he began to speak unto them by parables a certain man planted a vineyard and set an hedge about it and digged a place for the wine fat and built a tower and let it out to husbandman and went into a far country and at the season he sent to the husbandman a servant that he might receive from the husbandman of the fruit of the vineyard and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty and again he sent them to them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in their head and sent him away shamefully handled and again he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing some having yet therefore one son his well beloved he sent him also last unto them saying they will reverence my son but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the air come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours and they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner this was the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes and they sought to lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their way and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words and when they will come they say unto him master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardless not the person of men but teach us the way of god in truth is it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempt ye me bring me a penny that i may see it and they brought it and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription and they said unto him caesar's and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesar's and to god the things that are god's and they marveled at him then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying master moses wrote unto us if a man's brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and the third likewise and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman died also in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore er because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven and as touching the dead they that rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living he therefore do greatly er and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is one god and there is none other but he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that just ask him any question and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how say the scribes that christ is the son of david for david himself said by the holy ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he then his son and the common people heard him gladly and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the marketplaces and the chief seats in the synagogues and the uppermost rooms at feasts which devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a fathing and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow have cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here and jesus answering said unto him see a star these great buildings there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled and jesus answering them began to say take heed lest any man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many and when you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars be ye not troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in diverse places and there shall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrows but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and you shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gospel must first be published among all nations but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye but it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the father the son and children shall rise up against their parents and shall cause them to be put to death and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that you'll endure unto the end the same shall be saved but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judea flee to the mountains and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house neither enter therein to take anything out of his house and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither shall be and except that the lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elect's sake whom he hath chosen he hath shortened the days and then if any man shall say to you lo here is christ or lo he is there believe him not for false christs and false prophets shall rise and shall show signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the elect but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all things but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars of heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is near so ye in like manner when you shall see these things come to pass know that it is nigh even at the doors verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the crowing or in the morning lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping and what i say unto you i say unto all watch after two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put him to death but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of the people and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious and she break the box and poured it on his head and there were some that had indignation within themselves and said why was this waste of the ointment made for it might have been sold for more than 300 pence and have been given to the poor and they murmured against her and jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath brought a good work on me for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will you may do them good but me ye have not always she has done what she could she has come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her and judas iscariot one of the twelve went on to the chief priests to betray him unto them and when they heard it they were glad and promised to give him money and he sought how he might conveniently betray him and the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover and he sendeth forth two of his disciples and seth unto them go ye into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the goodman of the house the master saith where is the guest chamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us and his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover and in the evening he cometh with the twelve and as they sat and did eat jesus said verily i say unto you one of you which eateth with me shall betray me and they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i and another said is it i and he answered and said unto them it is one of the twelve that tipth with me in the dish the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had never been born and as they did eat jesus took bread and blessed and break it and gave to them and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many verily i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god and when they had sung in hymn they went out into the mount of olives and jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered but after that i am risen i will go before you into galilee but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not i and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that this day even in this night before the crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice but he spake the more vehemently if i should die with thee i will not deny thee in any wise likewise also said they all and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he saith to his disciples sit ye here while i shall and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy and saith unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him and he said abba father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and seth unto peter simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words and when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither whisked they what to answer him and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour has come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand and immediately while he yet spake cometh judas one of the twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders and he that betrayed him had given them a token saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same as he take him and lead him away safely and as soon as he was come he go straightway to him and said master master and kissed him and they laid their hands on him and took him and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with staves to take me i was daily with you in the temple teaching and you took me not but the scriptures must be fulfilled and they all forsook him and fled and there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on him and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked and they led jesus away to the high priest and with him would assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes and peta followed him afar off and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death and found none for many bear false witness against him but their witness agreed not together and there arose certain and bear false witness against him saying we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and within three days i will build another made without hands but neither so did their witness agree together and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answer is thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but he held his peace and answered nothing again the high priest asked him and said unto him art thou the christ the son of the blessed and jesus said i am and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes and saith what need we any further witnesses ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye and they all condemned him to be guilty of death and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands and as peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the maids of the high priest and when she saw peter warming himself she looked upon him and said and thou also washed with jesus of nazareth but he denied saying i know not neither understand i what the hell sayest and he went out into the porch and the crew and a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood by this is one of them and he denied it again and a little after they that stood by said again to peter surely thou art one of them for thou art a galilean and thy speech agreeth thereto but he began to curse and to swear saying i know not this man of whom ye speak and the second time the crew and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him before the crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council and bound jesus and carried him away and delivered him to pilate and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews and he answering said unto him thou sayest it and the chief priests accused him of many things but he answered nothing and pilate asked him again saying answer is thou nothing behold how many things they witness against thee but jesus yet answered nothing so that pilate marveled now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoever they desired and there was one named barabbas which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him who had committed murder in the insurrection and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them but pilate answered them saying will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy but the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release barabbas unto them and pilate answered and said again unto them what will ye then that i shall do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews and they cried out again crucify him then pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done and they cried out the more exceedingly crucify him and so pilate willing to content the people released barabbas unto them and delivered jesus when he had scourged him to be crucified and the soldiers led him away into the hall called praetorium and they called together the whole band and they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head and began to salute him hail king of the jews and they smote him on the head with the reed and did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him and when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him and they compelled one simon a cyrenian who passed by coming out of the country the father of alexander and rufus to bear his cross and they bring him onto the place golgotha which is being interpreted the place of a skull and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he received it not and when they had crucified him they parted his garments casting lots upon them what every man should take and it was the third hour and they crucified him and the superscription of his accusation was written over the king of the jews and with him they crucified two thieves the one in his right hand and the other on his left and the scripture was fulfilled with seth and he was numbered with the transgressors and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying ah thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself and come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reviled him and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying i which is being interpreted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and some of them that stood by when they heard it said behold he calleth elias and one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink saying let alone let us see whether elias will come to take him down and jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and when the centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son of god there were also women looking on a far off among whom was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joseph and salome who also when he was in galilee followed him and ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem and now when the even was come because it was the preparation that is the day before the sabbath joseph of arimathea an honorable counselor which also waited for the kingdom of god came and went in boldly unto pilate and craved the body of jesus and pilate marveled if he were already dead and calling unto him the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead and when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body to joseph and he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock and rolled a stone onto the door of the sepulcher and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joseph beheld where he was laid
