[0:00] now we are very happy tonight have with
[0:04] us one of our guests share the as we
[0:10] call it the prayer service on New Year's
[0:13] night a good friend of mine brother
[0:15] Ernie fan ler one of the converts to the
[0:19] Lord Jesus Christ trophy of grace
[0:23] originating his home in Switzerland
[0:25] that's where he came from and I believe
[0:28] a brother with him there with her living
[0:31] in Shawano now German by descent a
[0:34] brother waters were happy to have them
[0:37] with us tonight and then we have also
[0:41] with us tonight a precious brother of
[0:45] the faith South Africa brother David
[0:49] Duke listen we're happy to have him with
[0:52] us - and we're David in our are
[0:57] anticipating or praying and Lord to give
[1:02] us some great work together this coming
[1:03] year into Africa and different parts of
[1:06] the world brother David is here now to
[1:10] talk it over and pray over with it
[1:13] between now and Monday to decide just
[1:16] when and where in to to Africa and
[1:19] different parts of the world to go as
[1:21] brother David has had a very prominent
[1:24] office with the Pentecostal world
[1:30] convention and also is well known with
[1:33] many great religious leaders throughout
[1:36] the entire world and it's been very
[1:41] influential in persuading and causing as
[1:45] far along as we are now to help bring
[1:47] the body of Jesus Christ together of all
[1:50] denominations of faith regardless of
[1:53] what they search they have or what they
[1:57] brand their branded it's that the church
[2:03] and who Christ died for him and I've
[2:06] often thought of that used to help round
[2:09] up the cattle many times out west we
[2:12] brother David and set out there where
[2:16] they drove the cattle up to the drift
[2:18] fence up into the mountains to feed them
[2:20] on the let them graze on the pastures
[2:23] the of the forest while the meadows was
[2:28] growing in the bottom wild Medes and
[2:30] then they cut the medes and feed the
[2:31] cattle out through the through the
[2:33] wintertime when there's two split up in
[2:35] the mountains and used to set their on
[2:38] the saddle and watch the Ranger bringing
[2:41] those cattle through in each ranch in
[2:44] the bottom that could raise a ton of hay
[2:46] I think a raise 50 ton of hay that meant
[2:50] they could but 50 cattle if they could
[2:51] raise a thousand ton of hay a thousand
[2:53] head of cattle could go through each man
[2:56] carrying a brand on his cow they watched
[3:00] the brands of course the different
[3:03] branches so they wouldn't get him mixed
[3:04] up and then when the Ranger he wasn't so
[3:10] interested and what kind of brands was
[3:12] going through because there's all kinds
[3:14] of brands but there's one thing and he
[3:16] really had to check that was a blood tag
[3:19] they had to be registered Hereford or
[3:21] they couldn't get through the gate they
[3:23] would turn it back see and I think
[3:26] that's the way it'll be at the judgment
[3:27] they'll not be what kind of brand we're
[3:30] wearing but if the blood tags there
[3:32] that's the thing that'll that'll count
[3:34] the blood tank and I'm very happy to
[3:38] have brother David with us and I'll see
[3:40] brother Estel dealer was here just a
[3:43] moment ago I seen him raised up back
[3:44] there from somewhere and other ministers
[3:47] who were wanting to hear from tonight
[3:49] and then and I guess brother Ruddell and
[3:54] then will be coming in calls her go to
[3:56] state till midnight
[3:57] however brother David can't stay till
[4:00] midnight
[4:01] he's very wanted man everywhere and as
[4:04] soon as brother Rogers heard that he was
[4:06] over here while he's going to stand and
[4:09] have him over there at 10 so that means
[4:11] you'll be leaving here pretty short to
[4:14] get way out there and South Louisville
[4:15] and I thought it would be nice if it
[4:19] would be alright with brother David if
[4:21] if we'd have him to come up and speak
[4:24] what's on his heart
[4:25] each forest do whatever the Lord lays
[4:27] we'd all like to hear brother David do
[4:29] places from South Africa let me say this
[4:33] that when I was in over in Africa and my
[4:37] great campaign the Lord gave us over
[4:40] there
[4:40] his brother was my interpreter brother
[4:44] justice I believe his name is brother
[4:46] justice and a real fine family of people
[4:50] are these Duke Lisi brothers I think is
[4:52] I guess they're all ministers as far as
[4:55] I know uh maybe father - that was the
[4:58] minister and they're from a fine family
[5:00] of people and brother David packs a
[5:03] great name amongst all the churches and
[5:05] denominations around the world and
[5:08] brother David I'd like for you to come
[5:10] up now and speak for us or whatever
[5:12] God's put on your heart to say come
[5:14] right up and I'm very happy to introduce
[5:16] to my church tonight this is brother
[5:19] they are Manorville our pastor and to
[5:24] the church this is one of my precious
[5:25] friends and and fellow warriors and the
[5:29] service of God brother David new places
[5:32] the South African brother David hurry
[5:39] right back and be with us again that's
[5:41] very fine we're sure happy brother David
[5:45] said some things I just wish that I had
[5:48] my pen I could have jot them down but
[5:50] I'll always remember grandsons the
[5:54] grandchildren well we sure appreciate a
[6:00] visit of our brother and he is was the
[6:05] connected with the world Conference of
[6:08] Pentecostal believers and a great man
[6:12] and the line of his work throughout the
[6:16] whole world and we were fortunate
[6:18] tonight to have brother David come speak
[6:20] to us on this New Year's night and you
[6:22] can see what great men think about our
[6:26] long
[6:27] think about his great service now I
[6:32] believe that tomorrow in being new years
[6:38] it's just a few hours now and had to
[6:43] leave early in the morning so I thought
[6:44] I'd just speak a little bit if it's all
[6:48] right little brother Beeler and the
[6:50] other ministry share won't take much the
[6:53] time and I think if we'd say Amen and go
[6:55] home and be a wonderful message and we
[6:57] could be thankful to the Lord for what
[7:01] that we have here tonight and now but
[7:07] this being New Year's night we just
[7:09] entertained each other by the kingdom of
[7:12] God preaching until it comes a new year
[7:16] and I've got to get up in the morning
[7:18] you're here early way before they and
[7:20] I'm not as young as David maybe I maybe
[7:26] I don't feel as young as she does he's a
[7:28] horse David's a little little bit older
[7:31] than I am I think he's separate years
[7:33] older maybe ten but he's a certainly a
[7:37] fireball for God travelling 50,000 miles
[7:40] this year for the kingdom of God on his
[7:44] road now where to preach it brother
[7:45] Rogers and tomorrow to be with some
[7:48] somewhere else and somewhere else and
[7:50] somewhere else and back here in Monday

[9:17] Switzerland Germany on down but we don't
[9:20] know yet you keep praying I don't want
[9:23] to go nowhere until God says go and the
[9:27] best of my knowledge therefore if I feel
[9:29] led to go then want to get off the plane
[9:31] I in the waters the opposition is I
[9:34] could say I come in the name of the Lord
[9:36] Jesus I was thankful for David the
[9:41] friendship that we've had together
[9:43] because the man is a very important man
[9:46] but he he certainly believes this
[9:49] Ministry of the Lord he certainly does
[9:51] and our names have been associated
[9:54] together throughout the entire world now
[9:56] brother David 9 and I'm so glad to have
[10:01] association with a man like that but
[10:04] friends I appreciate that but the
[10:06] greatest thing that I can think of being
[10:08] associated with Jesus Christ the Son of
[10:11] God great one now brother never leave
[10:15] some of them of be speaking in a few
[10:17] moments but I want to read just a little
[10:18] something out of the scripture now and
[10:20] it's good I think on New Year's life to
[10:23] see different preachers the way they
[10:25] approach the texts and what they say and
[10:27] so forth and each man having his own way
[10:30] of preaching you know God didn't make us
[10:31] all alike
[10:32] he made us different he made us
[10:35] different than our statue he made the
[10:36] world different and big mountains the
[10:39] little mountains prairies deserts big
[10:41] white flowers blue flowers and all
[10:44] different kinds he just makes us
[10:46] different that's all he makes redhead
[10:48] black heads
[10:49] why did a fat slim tall and all of
[10:53] whatever Morrissey
[10:54] he just is makes us different God is a
[10:58] God of variety and I kind of like that
[11:00] don't you but just the same thing all so
[11:05] let us turn now in our scriptures over
[11:08] in the book of st. Matthew st. Matthew's
[11:13] Gospel a beginning with the and the
[11:16] fourth verse I want to read far a read
[11:22] it's a text the Lord helping us st.
[11:26] Matthew the fourth chapter
[11:40] I believe before we read let's pray
[11:46] gracious Heavenly Father it is again
[11:50] with grateful hearts that we approach
[11:53] this new year and we approach thee and
[11:59] bring to thee all of our cares of the
[12:03] past and past that you put them in the
[12:06] seal forgetfulness and remember our sins
[12:09] against us no more and may not only we
[12:14] check up with our spiritual being but in
[12:18] our may we check our fellowship with
[12:20] thee and forgive us of all of our sins
[12:24] and we ask that your spirit will deal
[12:27] with us tonight if there be any unclean
[12:31] thing about us Lord take it as far as
[12:34] the East is from the West cast it into
[12:37] the sea of forgetfulness t remembered
[12:39] against us no more that we might enter
[12:42] into this new year clean wash by the
[12:45] blood of the Lamb and be ready made this
[12:49] 19 and 60 be the greatest year that
[12:53] we've ever served you give us
[12:56] exceedingly abundantly all these
[12:59] meetings that are in progress Lord that
[13:01] we're thinking of with brother do places
[13:03] around the world into the Asian over
[13:07] into Europe and all around Lord let it
[13:12] be your will and your power that'll lead
[13:15] to these things and if we should at any
[13:18] time be stepping off of your divine
[13:22] ordained path may the Holy Spirit put a
[13:26] blocking away and stop us Lord and turn
[13:29] us back to the right place
[13:31] friend bless this little church Lord MOT
[13:35] way close to 30 years I guess it stood
[13:38] here now as a memorial of the grace of
[13:40] God to a humble people we pray father

[13:46] pastor bless all the church bless the

[13:59] able to grow this year in the grace of
[14:01] God and may our members ship grow into
[14:05] greater numbers and more grace of yours
[14:09] that then this has been in the years
[14:12] gone by
[14:13] granted father now I help us as we
[14:16] approach this text that we're fixing to
[14:19] read thy word and only you Lord can
[14:23] interpret and we pray that you'll grant
[14:25] it to us for the kingdom of God's sake
[14:28] in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[14:34] we're now seeing just now thought I have
[14:37] chosen for a text for the next few
[14:40] moments it's found in the scripture here
[14:44] and I will read it it's call or call it
[14:47] this from that time I didn't think I
[14:53] said the other night I didn't suppose I
[14:54] get to come down because it my throat
[14:57] was getting raw and my wife said to me
[15:00] yesterday or day before she said then I
[15:03] suppose you'll not be going down to the
[15:06] church and I said honey I don't think so
[15:08] my throat's so sore and raw and then no
[15:13] more than that night when I sit down he
[15:15] picked up the scripture I run on to this
[15:17] brother saath Minh came by he said would
[15:21] you be going to church tomorrow night I
[15:22] said yeah I'll be there and mediate
[15:25] looked around at me and she said I don't
[15:27] understand you I said I don't expect you
[15:30] to think I said or no one else no one
[15:33] that's led by the Spirit of God can ever
[15:35] be understood our Lord they could not
[15:39] understand him he looked like he talked
[15:41] one way one minute and another way
[15:43] another minute and somewhere else he
[15:44] talked about something else sometimes it
[15:46] was Jesus speaking the other times it
[15:48] was God speaking you seen even the
[15:51] disciples said their place a low now
[15:54] speaker saw plainly now we understand
[15:56] then Jesus says do you under you now
[15:59] believe see after that you just can't do
[16:02] it they called your letter the spirit
[16:04] and you start doing something you find
[16:06] out that
[16:07] you see your God wants to use you
[16:09] somewhere you got stop here and go here
[16:10] just letter the spirit there are odd
[16:12] peculiar people that has a life that you
[16:16] want to consecrate to God and then I
[16:18] always say this I will do this if the
[16:22] Lord is willing see if I make a promise
[16:25] to anybody I'll do it if the Lord is
[16:28] willing and therefore then if it is the
[16:31] will of Lord Nabi I'll speak on this
[16:35] message if the Lord is willing he could
[16:37] give me a call write this message to
[16:39] take off for California I cast aside
[16:42] everything and take off for California
[16:44] as hard as I could go and I want to live
[16:47] like that I don't want nothing tying me
[16:48] down I don't want no great big something
[16:52] in other words worth millions of dollars

[16:59] these people's only five of them but go
[17:01] down there stay there after you leave I
[17:03] want to go there I haven't got no
[17:05] obligations and if he wants me go
[17:07] overseas I heard it just mentioned going
[17:10] to Germany artists to Africa and some
[17:14] millionaire woman just the time if the
[17:17] spirit pulled up on me to go to Africa
[17:18] she said I'll sponsor the trip and pay
[17:20] every bit of it that's all why should I
[17:24] worry about money and things with my
[17:25] father owns all of it he can just speak
[17:29] to this rich man or that rich man or
[17:31] this people or that people and no need
[17:33] of me have to worry about it see God
[17:35] just takes care of it all well that's
[17:37] where you live just let him take care of
[17:39] it
[17:40] it's so good now let us turn in our
[17:42] scriptures to the fourth chapter and
[17:45] let's begin to to read about the 12th
[17:49] verse of the 4th chapter of the Gospel
[17:52] according to st. Matthew
[17:55] now when Jesus had been and now when
[17:59] Jesus had heard that John was cast into
[18:02] prison he departed unto Galilee leaving
[18:08] nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum
[18:12] which is upon the Seacoast in the
[18:15] borders of zu berlin at Netherland
[18:20] that it might be fulfilled which was
[18:23] spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the
[18:27] land of Zebulun and the land of neptulon
[18:31] by the way of the sea beyond jordan
[18:35] galilee of the gentiles the people that
[18:40] set in darkness saw great light and to
[18:44] them that would set in the regions of
[18:47] the shadow of death light is sprung up
[18:50] from that time Jesus began to preach to
[18:57] them to say repent for the kingdom of
[19:01] heaven is at hand I want to speak on the
[19:05] subject and from that time you know as
[19:10] human beings we all think of things from
[19:17] a certain time substance such a thing
[19:20] taken place and from that time and now
[19:28] many times you meet an old man or an old
[19:31] woman and they like to refer back to a
[19:36] time that something taken place that
[19:39] they can distinctively mark it out and
[19:43] say it was at that time now I suppose
[19:49] there's practically all of us sure
[19:52] tonight could call to member memory
[19:55] remembrance of certain things that taken
[19:59] place at certain time from that time
[20:03] something changed something such a thing
[20:10] it happened at that time and from that
[20:13] time on it was different and it's a good
[20:19] thing that we can in some of those
[20:21] memories of things that we think of is
[20:25] worthy
[20:27] things that change and there's some
[20:31] things that is not so worthy of thinking
[20:35] of for instance if the woman of an ill
[20:40] thing that she said there was a time
[20:47] that I was a good righteous moral girl
[20:53] and on a certain night or a certain
[20:57] place a certain thing happened and since
[21:03] that time she's been on the wrong road
[21:09] her life has been marred with sin and
[21:14] blackness darkness and all the judgment
[21:19] waits her but she can remember from that
[21:23] certain time it happened when she tucked
[21:27] the wrong road the the Junkman's a night
[21:32] on the streets that trying to drink his
[21:36] sorrows away you might pick him up like
[21:42] I was down on the Bowery here some time
[21:45] ago in New York the great center of the
[21:48] drunken people I was walking with a
[21:52] certain minister and there laid a man oh
[21:56] this plenty of man harmless helpless
[22:02] laying there with the front of their
[22:05] clothes all wet and and their beard all
[22:09] over their faces and just in a terrible
[22:13] condition and they were perfectly
[22:17] harmless
[22:19] and this minister said pick that one up
[22:23] and just ask him now I went over to this
[22:26] man which was lame with one foot across
[22:30] the bumper of a car and his head laying
[22:32] down on the street
[22:34] and where that he had been unable to
[22:38] to go with hands on the to the restroom
[22:43] and so he was just in a terrible
[22:45] condition and I took a hold of him and I
[22:49] said can you speak and he wouldn't make
[22:53] me no answer so the minister got down he
[22:55] knows more about how to deal with you
[22:58] and he asked him who are you
[23:01] finally got him roused up enough to see
[23:04] if you oh by me a drink and come to find
[23:09] out he could port his finger to the bank
[23:14] that he used to be president of well is
[23:21] that we are preachers could you tell me
[23:25] what took place
[23:27] if you promised me a drink
[23:30] well we couldn't do that I said I
[23:34] couldn't add sorrow to your sorrows I
[23:37] want to help you all this story come
[23:43] home one night and there was a what he
[23:46] called a Dear John letter on the table
[23:51] that is wife and nifty minute he loved
[23:55] her and she taken his children and he
[23:58] was divorced and run away with
[24:01] another man and he said I didn't know
[24:05] what to do to shoot my brains out or
[24:08] what to do so I went down to the saloon
[24:11] and from that time there he was that's
[24:20] all over the world the liar you might
[24:26] take one as I've said to man one day
[24:29] that our thought was telling jokes and
[24:32] come to find out that he told so many
[24:35] lies II really believe in myself and I
[24:39] said what makes you do that now sit down
[24:42] to talk with him I said I want to ask
[24:45] you those stories or two why
[24:48] for people to believe he said that first
[24:52] one I can ever remember telling he said
[24:56] I was the little boy that was raised in
[25:00] a good home and he said I went out and
[25:05] smoked corn silk cigarettes just to be
[25:09] smart and I eat some coffee to take it
[25:13] all for my breath and you said I'd done
[25:15] it back behind the old chimney behind
[25:18] the house and he said I'll never forget
[25:22] when mother caught me up and said to me
[25:26] Sonny let me smell your breath and I'll
[25:32] blow my breath into her face and she
[25:34] said you've eat coffee to take something
[25:37] off of your breath what have you been
[25:39] doing have you been smoking cigarettes
[25:41] and he said something told me to tell
[25:46] her the truth you said but I said no
[25:51] mama I cross my heart I haven't been
[25:54] smoking cigarettes he said in from that
[25:57] time that started it we can all find
[26:05] something beginning at a certain time
[26:09] and from that all things was changed and
[26:18] there's other worthy things that we
[26:22] could think of man with good intentions
[26:26] has tried to start things anew to do
[26:31] things at certain time for instance when
[26:34] electricity was first in found by
[26:38] Benjamin Franklin and it was able to
[26:40] conquer they begin to say from this time
[26:45] all there'll never be no more Wars
[26:49] because of this electricity can be put
[26:52] into fences with such a high voltage -
[26:55] no man could cross it they meant well
[27:01] and right after the first world war when
[27:04] when the Kaiser Wilhelm signed the
[27:08] Treaty of Peace we were told here in
[27:11] America I was a boy of about nine years
[27:14] old but I could remember of the people
[27:17] all saying we'll never have another war
[27:23] from this time on it's settled forever
[27:28] but we had another war I'm one of the
[27:34] great you in all right I would say
[27:38] before that they form what was called
[27:41] the League of Nations and they said now
[27:47] we'll have no more Wars because we've
[27:50] got a League of Nations that will patrol
[27:53] the world and if there is enough bras
[27:57] somewhere these men out of every nation
[28:00] will go there and police the world but
[28:06] it was a failure it was not on having
[28:10] wars and the Union will become the same
[28:17] thing we are told out by prediction at
[28:21] tomorrow night our Sunday night the same
[28:27] man that predicted Pearl Harbor to the
[28:29] deck moment that the the airplanes would
[28:32] vomit said that Sunday night at 12
[28:36] o'clock that 75 percent of the American
[28:39] people going to ashes that Russia will
[28:43] bomb the United States this coming
[28:46] Sunday night at 12 o'clock the same man
[28:48] it predicted Pearl Harbor they're not
[28:50] putting it out cause people go Frannie I
[28:53] don't believe it no because he can't
[28:57] suffer atomic war one of theirs pastures
[29:00] of sound mayor this way we'll throw in
[29:02] that way in the world will go to pieces
[29:03] something's got to happen yet before
[29:05] Jesus comes that's right for instance
[29:10] the young married couple that
[29:14] was a certain time that they got married
[29:17] and they they put their bowels together
[29:19] and they pledged one to another their
[29:23] loyalty and they said that we will love
[29:29] honor and cherish each other as long as
[29:33] we both live but there come a time that
[29:40] something happened all these things are
[29:46] there's a time when something happens
[29:49] and maybe all their vows and all the
[29:53] league's of Nations and so forth maybe
[29:55] had good intentions but they all come to
[30:00] an end all become crawling beneath this
[30:07] the the feet of man with all the good
[30:12] intentions we can have or all must come
[30:16] tune in
[30:30] [Music]
[31:10] you
