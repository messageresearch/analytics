[4:08] he might manifest his promised words
[4:11] through us or we ask it in Jesus name
[4:16] amen now tonight you who watch the text
[4:20] let's turn in the Bible to the book of
[4:23] second Peter and begin with the 15th
[4:25] verse just for a way of speaking of the
[4:27] scripture for a few moments moreover I
[4:31] will endeavor that you may be able after
[4:34] my decease to have these things always
[4:38] in remembrance for we have not followed
[4:41] cunningly devices
[4:44] fables when we made known unto you the
[4:48] power and the coming of the Lord Jesus
[4:53] Christ but were eyewitnesses of his
[4:57] majesty I love that I are witnesses not
[5:01] some Fable we are a witness of what
[5:03] we're talking about for he received from
[5:07] God the Father honor and glory and there
[5:11] came such a voice to him from the
[5:15] excellent
[5:17] Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I
[5:21] am well pleased and this voice which
[5:25] came from heaven we heard when we were
[5:29] with him in the Holy mouth we have also
[5:33] a more sure word of Prophecy or unto you
[5:37] may do well that you take heed as unto a
[5:41] light that shineth in dark place until
[5:46] the day Dawn and the day star arise in
[5:49] your hearts knowing this first that no
[5:55] Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[5:59] private
[6:00] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[6:03] in Old Times by the will of man but holy
[6:07] man of God spake as they were moved by
[6:11] the Holy
[6:13] Ghost may the Lord add His blessings to
[6:15] the reading of his word
[6:18] now I'm going to take this for a subject
[6:22] God is his own
[6:25] interpreter we are living in a day of
[6:28] confusion
[6:29] we're living in a day that when men and
[6:32] women hardly know what to do everything
[6:36] is it seems to be in a
[6:39] turmoil
[6:40] everything it seems to be there's so
[6:42] many different ways to look that's Satan
[6:45] to do that now God
[6:48] cannot uh judge a people righteously or
[6:53] right unless there be some standard that
[6:56] he has to judge them by and the Bible
[6:59] says that he'll judge all men by Jesus
[7:02] Christ and Jesus Christ is the word St
[7:06] John the first chapter said in the
[7:08] beginning was the word and the Word was
[7:10] with God and the Word was God and the
[7:13] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[7:16] now all we are today is the display of
[7:18] his attributes in God first he was not
[7:22] even God God we just call him the
[7:26] Eternal one he wasn't God because the
[7:29] word word English word god means object
[7:32] of worship and there was nothing to
[7:34] worship him so he was the Eternal one
[7:37] the the main Fountain of all
[7:41] intelligence and in this Fountain of all
[7:44] intelligence there was not a atom
[7:46] molecule or nothing light nowhere star
[7:50] moon nothing
[7:51] else God what we know is God the great
[7:55] spirit that was eternal never did begin
[7:58] never did end he was there and in him
[8:02] was attributes it was attributes to be
[8:05] God then it attributes to be a father
[8:08] attributes to be a son attributes to be
[8:11] a savior attributes to be a Healer all
[8:14] these attributes was in him and now he
[8:18] these things that has unfolded since
[8:20] then are just his attributes being made
[8:24] manifest what I mean attributes was his
[8:27] thoughts and a a word is a thought
[8:31] expressed and then that was in his
[8:33] thinking and when he said let there be
[8:35] and there was let there be and there was
[8:39] and now remember you Christians were his
[8:43] thoughts before there was a world and
[8:46] you are the manifestation of his
[8:49] thinking before there even was a world
[8:51] you were in Christ amen and God in the
[8:55] beginning that makes you then you see
[8:57] his subjects and the whole thing is God
[9:00] himself materializing himself tangible
[9:04] so he could be handled seen and and so
[9:07] forth and that's what God is the whole
[9:09] thing then people say the
[9:12] interpretation I was speaking here not
[9:14] long ago in a meeting a man said to me
[9:16] he said brother brandom you have the
[9:17] wrong interpretation you don't interpret
[9:20] that right now we hear you go to
[9:22] Methodist and they say the Baptist don't
[9:24] interpret right the Baptist say the
[9:26] Pentecostals don't the Pentecostal says
[9:28] that the Oneness don't the one that says
[9:30] assemblies don't and each one says the
[9:31] other one don't God is his own
[9:33] interpreter he don't need anybody to
[9:35] interpret for him right he does his own
[9:38] interpreting who is the man that can
[9:40] interpret God God is his own interpreter
[9:43] now Peter speaking here we find out that
[9:46] in the beginning when God said let there
[9:49] be light and there was light that's the
[9:51] interpretation to it when God said
[9:53] anything and it was manifested then
[9:55] that's God's interpretation that his
[9:57] word's right see when he said let there
[10:00] be light that was in his thinking first
[10:02] before there was such a thing as light
[10:04] when he said let there be light light
[10:05] sprung into the skies that's the
[10:08] interpretation nobody has to interpret
[10:09] that for God said so and there it was
[10:13] when God speaks and it's manifested
[10:15] that's the interpretation of his word
[10:18] why can't man see that why don't people
[10:20] see that God makes a promise and God
[10:24] says in in the beginning in Genesis he
[10:26] lotted his word to each age as it come
[10:29] down from the beginning to the end and
[10:31] down through these ages the church world
[10:34] has got all these things all mixed up
[10:36] with traditions and so forth and God
[10:38] always sends on the scene down through
[10:40] the Old Testament and New prophets and
[10:42] the word of the Lord comes to the
[10:43] prophet and how does it do it it
[10:45] manifests the word of God prise God's
[10:48] manifestation that tells whether it's
[10:51] right or wrong nobody has to interpret
[10:53] it the word interprets itself God
[10:55] promised it and there it happens what
[10:57] good does it do to say anything else
[10:58] about it is a sinful man that would try
[11:00] to say when God made a promise and God
[11:02] does it and that interpretation is wrong
[11:04] that's God himself doing his own
[11:06] interpretation interpreting he don't
[11:08] need anybody to interpret him he
[11:10] interprets himself by manifesting what
[11:13] he promised that he would do or if the
[11:15] church could only see that and see the
[11:18] promises that's lotted for each age all
[11:20] other ages God has sent on the scene
[11:22] even down through the seven Church ages
[11:24] and has manifested everything that he
[11:27] promised to do every thing there's not
[11:30] one thing left undone exactly what he
[11:32] said he would do that he did because
[11:35] when God said him back there and Isaiah
[11:37] he said a virgin shall conceive and she
[11:40] did that's right now who who can
[11:43] interpret that God done the
[11:45] interpretation he said a virgin shall
[11:47] conceive and she conceived now what do
[11:49] you ain't nothing can be said about that
[11:51] because God said she would and she did
[11:53] it amen but the church was too blind
[11:56] then to see it see they had their own ey
[11:59] idea of it it was too too different than
[12:02] what they was expecting Peter here was
[12:05] referring back he said God manifested
[12:08] Christ by his word he said this is my
[12:11] beloved Son these Believers were
[12:13] standing there and Christ was the
[12:15] manifestation of God he always
[12:18] manifested Christ by his word because
[12:20] Christ is the wordl he manifest always
[12:24] the Lord when he said in the days of
[12:26] Noah Christ was in Noah do you believe
[12:28] that Noah said it's going to rain there
[12:32] will be a rain the Earth will be
[12:33] destroyed it rained that didn't need any
[12:36] interpretation it rained because God in
[12:40] Noah said it's going to rain he was a
[12:42] prophet Hallelujah and the evidence was
[12:44] that what he said come to pass so you
[12:47] don't need to interpret that some of
[12:49] Might around and say this man don't know
[12:50] what he's talking about but God had
[12:52] always promised that there be one among
[12:53] you who spiritual a prophet and what he
[12:55] says comes to pass then hear it that's
[12:58] right because it's true it must be in
[13:00] accordance with the word and Noah was in
[13:03] accordance with the word when he
[13:05] prophesied it's going to rain and it
[13:07] rained that didn't need any
[13:09] interpretation for that because it did
[13:11] just that Isaiah said a virgin shall
[13:13] conceive and she did now that was awful
[13:17] unusual or it was many hundred years
[13:19] later before this virgin conceived it
[13:21] was so unusual until a good man by the
[13:23] name of Joseph her husband being a just
[13:26] man and was not willing to make her a
[13:28] public example that good man in those
[13:31] days how it must have been with Joseph
[13:33] when he was engaged spoused to Mary she
[13:36] was uh espoused in that day to break
[13:39] that was just the same as uh committing
[13:42] adultery and of course to Joseph it
[13:44] seemed like that Mary was trying to use
[13:46] him for a blockade or make him be a
[13:49] shield for her wrong because sure she
[13:52] was found to be a mother not being
[13:54] married only engaged a trick like that
[13:56] would be stoned to death it had to be by
[13:59] the law and Joseph her husband was a
[14:01] just man a very just man he believed God
[14:04] and once you look at him with those
[14:06] lovely big soft eyes and say Joseph
[14:08] Gabriel the archangel visit me and told
[14:11] me that I was going to conceive knowing
[14:13] no man now if Joseph were just to look
[14:16] back in the scripture the prophet said
[14:19] she'd do that prise the Lord it was only
[14:21] God interpreting his own word amen but
[14:25] it was too unusual that's right that's
[14:27] what's the matter in any age
[14:29] the word of God is foreign to people
[14:32] it's too unusual God always does the
[14:35] unusual it's unusual any where God is
[14:39] it's against the systematics of the
[14:40] world because that they've got things
[14:43] the way that they think it should be but
[14:45] God comes in and does the unusual how
[14:47] could this virgin conceive he was honest
[14:50] he sought God about it and then God
[14:53] spoke to him in a dream and said Joseph
[14:55] thou son of David fear not to take in
[14:57] thee marry thy wife for that which is
[14:59] conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit
[15:03] God has overshadowed her this is what's
[15:05] done it Jeff notice how God dealt with
[15:08] Joseph there in a secondary way in the
[15:11] way of a dream now we know these dreams
[15:13] we believe in dreams I Believe In Dreams
[15:15] then God's always dealt with people in
[15:16] dreams but dream is secondarily see it
[15:19] could be right or wrong unless it's
[15:21] interpreted but he didn't need any
[15:22] interpretation it was God himself
[15:24] speaking directly to Joseph because
[15:26] there wasn't a prophet in the land in
[15:28] them days to interpret but there hadn't
[15:29] had a prophet for 400 years so the next
[15:32] best that God cared for the well far of
[15:34] his own son was speak to Joseph through
[15:37] a dream and without interpretation he
[15:39] said the woman is right that Holy thing
[15:42] which is conceived in her as the Son of
[15:43] God Amen didn't need any interpretation
[15:46] God does his own interpret it the honest
[15:49] sincere Hearts men and women that looks
[15:52] upon the the thing is mysterious if
[15:54] you're honest and sincere and but
[15:57] believe God has a way of interpreting it
[15:59] to you first find out if it's a promise
[16:02] if Joseph had just went back got away
[16:04] from the traditions and went back to the
[16:06] Bible and find out Isaiah said she's
[16:08] going to do that and the things that was
[16:10] spoke of in his birth and all about it
[16:12] was spoke by the scriptures by the holy
[16:14] prophets as Peter said and no man has a
[16:17] right to put any private interpretation
[16:18] of that it's just exactly what God Said
[16:21] would take place he was a manifestation
[16:24] of the word of God promised for that day
[16:27] God said it so there it was that settled
[16:29] it Jesus said when he was on earth when
[16:31] they couldn't understand his ministry it
[16:33] was too great too phenomena they
[16:35] couldn't phenomenal rather they couldn't
[16:37] understanding he said search the
[16:40] scriptures yes I hope I'm not deafening
[16:42] you out there blasting into that search
[16:44] the scriptures for in them you think you
[16:46] have eternal life and they are they that
[16:49] testify me praise God they are the ones
[16:52] who tell you who I am yes see God lotted
[16:56] the word that day was to be the
[16:58] manifestation
[16:59] of God God Emmanuel with us his name
[17:03] Shall be Called wonderful counselor PE
[17:05] Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting
[17:08] father and his name Shall be Called
[17:10] Emmanuel God With Us God was in David
[17:13] God was in Moses God as God all the way
[17:16] through manifesting himself for that age
[17:18] but this age a virgin shall
[17:21] conceive and she'll bring forth the son
[17:23] and he will be God With Us amen yeah
[17:28] that's what they crucified him for
[17:30] making himself God and also for breaking
[17:33] the Sabbath he was he was God over the
[17:36] Sabbath and he was God and he was not
[17:39] just a ordinary man or an ordinary
[17:41] Prophet yet he was an ordinary man and a
[17:43] prophet but he was the god prophet and
[17:46] he was a fulfilling of the word exactly
[17:48] what God said he would do so which one
[17:51] of you can condemn me of sin search the
[17:53] scriptures in them you think you have
[17:55] eternal life and they are they which
[17:57] testify me but they Traditions they was
[17:59] living in a glare of another age as I
[18:02] was preaching a few weeks ago living in
[18:03] a glare a glare is a mirage the sun
[18:06] reflecting itself and it's false and any
[18:09] glare of another age is a false
[18:11] reflection yes people always are walking
[18:13] in something that happened years ago the
[18:15] Lutheran are walking in the Lutheran
[18:17] glare Luther's sunlight was fine in his
[18:19] day Wesley was good in his day the
[18:21] Pentecostal was good in it day we're
[18:23] going on up the ladder we're living in
[18:26] another age Hallelujah on
[18:29] right we're going on on we can't keep
[18:31] looking back when we get ourselves
[18:33] settled down in things we think we got
[18:34] it all made we get our Traditions
[18:36] wrapped up and that was all right for
[18:38] that day but we're moving on search the
[18:40] scriptures and see what's promised for
[18:42] today right and we'll know where we're
[18:44] at Hallelujah and we can tell where
[18:46] we're standing Luther you can look in
[18:48] the scripture and see in that in that s
[18:50] age you can see exactly what was
[18:52] promised look what kind of a rider went
[18:53] forth look what went to Mee him exactly
[18:56] the kindness of man Reformation watch
[19:00] Wes and so forth as it come on down into
[19:02] the Pentecostal age and down through
[19:04] that age watch How It's travel look at
[19:06] the scriptures and see where we're at
[19:07] that's the reason Jesus said search the
[19:10] scriptures see where we're at I believe
[19:13] we're at the coming of the Son of God
[19:15] right now I believe we're at the age of
[19:17] the the very hour that he might appear
[19:19] at any time I believe the scriptures
[19:21] declare that that we're in the last
[19:24] hours of the history of this world I can
[19:27] see things as are shaping see this
[19:29] ecumenical council leading all the
[19:30] churches into it into the mark of the
[19:32] beast and see the Roman Empire and what
[19:35] it's doing and all the rest of them see
[19:36] him getting together shutting out the
[19:39] light shutting off the gospel everybody
[19:41] had to belong to it and walk in their
[19:43] lights or you won't walk at all see
[19:45] we're at the end time there's nothing
[19:48] left for us but to hold on to God and
[19:50] believe his word the word is always
[19:53] right and the lady of see a church age
[19:55] that was the only church age of all of
[19:56] them that Christ was put on the outside
[19:58] of the church he was on the outside
[20:00] knocking what's happened this ecumenical
[20:03] counsel is what's going to put him out
[20:05] the Bible said he was be on the outside
[20:07] and he is it shuts off what the word and
[20:10] he is the word he's always been the word
[20:13] and he's still the word tonight amen he
[20:17] is the word the Bible said the word is
[20:19] sharper more powerful than a two- AED
[20:21] sword Hebrews the fourth chapter a
[20:23] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[20:25] the heart the word was they should have
[20:27] known who he was when Jesus said that in
[20:30] that day watch what he did one day he
[20:32] was standing there at The First
[20:33] beginning of his ministry there was a
[20:35] man came to him name of Simon Simon
[20:37] Peter and when Peter looked upon him and
[20:40] and saw him Jesus said to him your name
[20:42] is Simon and you're the son of
[20:45] Jonas he should have know that Moses
[20:47] said the Lord your God shall raise up a
[20:50] prophet liken unto me and him you must
[20:53] hear and here was a man that had never
[20:55] seen him in his life said your name is
[20:57] Simon
[20:59] and you're the son of Jonas why he's
[21:01] told right then that that could be no
[21:03] more they hadn't had a prophet for
[21:05] hundreds of years and here was the man
[21:07] telling him who he was Hallelujah no
[21:09] wonder he could receive it Philip at
[21:11] that time went uh and found Nathaniel
[21:14] under a tree and brought him back to
[21:16] Jesus Jesus said behold an Israelite in
[21:18] whom there's no gu he said Rabbi when
[21:21] did you ever know me he said before
[21:23] Philip called you when you were under
[21:24] the tree I saw you Hallelujah he said
[21:27] rabbi th the Son of God you're the king
[21:30] of
[21:31] Israel he know that was what it didn't
[21:33] need any interpretation no right Jehovah
[21:37] said that there stood those there who
[21:39] didn't believe it they said this man's
[21:41] beob he's got a he's got some kind of a
[21:43] trick he's pulling he he's a fortune
[21:45] teller or something Jesus looked at him
[21:47] and said while you speak that against
[21:49] the son of man be forgiven you but when
[21:51] the Holy Ghost is come to do the same
[21:53] thing speak against that it'll never be
[21:55] forgiven you in this world or the world
[21:57] to come he was prophesying of our day
[22:00] Hallelujah the day that we should see
[22:02] for he is the same yesterday today and
[22:05] forever amen remember it was Jesus
[22:08] Christ that was in Moses it was Jesus
[22:10] Christ that was in David when David the
[22:12] son of uh David's went up on the
[22:15] mountain a rejected King and wept over
[22:16] Jerusalem that was nothing but Christ in
[22:18] him for about 800 years later the son of
[22:21] David set up over the Mount of Olives
[22:24] and looked down upon Jerusalem and wept
[22:26] and said Jerusalem Jerusalem how often I
[22:28] have hovered you as a Henwood bro but
[22:30] you would not when Joseph was in prison
[22:32] that was Jesus when he was sold for PR
[22:35] near 30 pieces of silver that was Jesus
[22:37] yes when he was uh made pontier man that
[22:40] was Jesus when he set the right hand of
[22:42] pharaoh and when he left everybody a
[22:45] trumpet sound and everybody had to Bow
[22:46] and eat that was Jesus Hallelujah no man
[22:49] could come to Pharaoh only through
[22:51] through Joseph no man can come through
[22:53] God Only by Jesus it was Jesus
[22:57] Hallelujah the word prophesied being
[23:01] fulfilled spoken shadows and types Jesus
[23:05] is here on Earth he did the same thing
[23:07] the prophets did that's why they know
[23:09] that he was God's manifestation of his
[23:12] word it didn't need to be interpreted
[23:15] when Nathaniel saw they he fell down
[23:17] said Thou Art the king of Israel the Son
[23:19] of God the king of Israel we know you no
[23:21] man could do this Nicodemus came but
[23:23] night said the same thing for the
[23:25] Pharisees but you see they were so
[23:27] hooked up in their ecumenical
[23:29] counsel that they could not accept it he
[23:32] expressed what they said said Rabbi we
[23:34] who's we they're
[23:36] counsil we know that thou a teacher come
[23:39] from God calls no man could do these
[23:41] things lest God be with him they
[23:43] recognize it they know it was but they
[23:45] were so hooked into it God in the past
[23:49] 40 years has shooked this nation with
[23:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallu and
[23:54] men and women are still outside of it
[23:57] because they're hooked into a same thing
[23:59] living in a glare of another day yes
[24:02] amen what's the matter everyone wants to
[24:03] be a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[24:05] Lutheran or something see it's a glare
[24:08] they were living in the glare of Moses
[24:09] day what did he say he said they said
[24:12] we're Moses disciples he said if You'
[24:15] known Moses You' known me Moses wrote on
[24:17] me yes right if you known Luther You'
[24:20] know this age if you know Methodist you
[24:23] know this age right but Christ wrote of
[24:26] this age the words is being fulfilled
[24:28] has to be fulfilled in this Agee it
[24:30] doesn't need somebody to interpret it
[24:32] God does his own interpreting Hallelujah
[24:35] God interpretes himself because he's the
[24:37] only one that can interpret it God's
[24:39] promises always vindicates what he said
[24:42] and that's the interpretation now Jesus
[24:45] to save time Jesus said in St John the
[24:48] 14th chapter 12 verse he that believeth
[24:52] on me the works that I do shall he do
[24:55] also did he say it that's right I don't
[24:58] need any interpreted when somebody does
[25:00] that work that's God certainly he also
[25:03] said in there as it was in the days of
[25:07] lot so shall it be at the coming of the
[25:09] son of man Jesus said that did he say it
[25:13] certainly he said it that needs no
[25:15] interpreting they say well that means it
[25:17] meant just exactly what he said as it
[25:19] was in the days of lot so shall it be at
[25:23] the coming of the son of man what about
[25:25] the days of lot let's go back just for a
[25:27] moment find out what they were doing
[25:29] there were three classes of people in
[25:31] the days of lot believer make believer
[25:33] and unbeliever that's in every crowd the
[25:36] same thing we find out that the
[25:38] sodomites was the unbeliever lot was a
[25:40] make believer Abraham was the believer
[25:44] he was the one the Covenant was
[25:46] confirmed to he was the one that was
[25:48] looking for a promised
[25:49] son he was the one who was expecting it
[25:53] yes amen right I'm not amening myself
[25:56] amen means so be it and that's right
[25:59] Abraham was not in Sodom Abraham was up
[26:03] and out of Sodom he's a type of the
[26:06] spiritual church
[26:07] today lot is a type of the
[26:10] denominational Church down in Sodom yet
[26:13] watch the Bible said that the sins of
[26:15] Sodom vexed his righteous Soul daily why
[26:18] didn't have nerve enough to stand out
[26:20] against it there's a many of good man
[26:22] sitting in a church today looking out
[26:24] and seeing women with shs on and man
[26:26] doing these things and their members
[26:28] going playing golf on Sunday and picnic
[26:30] parties and swimming and things instead
[26:32] of attending church sitting home on
[26:33] Wednesday night watching television
[26:35] instead of attending church come on they
[26:37] feel like saying something about it but
[26:38] the board would cut them out come on
[26:41] what's the matter it's lot again looking
[26:43] out of his window and seeing the sin and
[26:45] afraid to call Sin Sin
