[2:30] was the sole criterion
[2:32] thus he was against works as a means of
[2:35] salvation and baptism as a means of
[2:36] regeneration
[2:38] he taught the mediation of christ apart
[2:40] from man as was the original and
[2:42] pentecostal concept
[2:44] he was a man given to much prayer and
[2:46] had learned that the more work he had to
[2:48] do
[2:48] and the more sorely he was pressed for
[2:50] time the more of his time he gave to god
[2:53] in prayer in order to ensure
[2:54] satisfactory results
[2:57] he knew what it was to battle with the
[2:59] devil and it is said that satan one day
[3:01] visibly appeared to him and he flung the
[3:03] ink well at him bidding him go
[3:06] another time two fanatics came to him to
[3:08] induce him to join with them in
[3:10] banishing all priests and bibles
[3:12] he discerned the spirit within them and
[3:14] sent them off
[3:16] it is recorded of dr martin luther in
[3:18] sauer's history volume 3 page 406
[3:22] that he was
[3:23] a prophet evangelist speaker in tongues
[3:26] interpreter in one person endowed with
[3:29] all nine gifts of the spirit
[3:32] what stirred his heart by the holy ghost
[3:34] and which was the little green shoot
[3:36] that signified that truth was coming
[3:38] back to the church as it was known at
[3:39] pentecost was the doctrine of
[3:41] justification
[3:43] salvation by grace apart from works
[3:46] i recognize that dr luther did not
[3:48] believe only and preach only
[3:50] justification
[3:51] but that was his major theme as indeed
[3:53] it had to be for that is the basic
[3:55] doctrine of the truth of the word
[3:58] he will be forever known as the
[3:59] instrument in the hand of god who
[4:01] revived this truth
[4:03] he was the fifth messenger and his
[4:04] message was
[4:06] the just shall live by faith
[4:09] surely we admit that he knew and did
[4:11] teach that we are to go from faith to
[4:13] faith his marvelous understanding of
[4:15] sovereignty election predestination and
[4:19] other truths show him to be a great man
[4:21] in the word
[4:22] yet i say again as do historians god
[4:25] used him to bring to the people god's
[4:27] standard against works the just shall
[4:29] live by faith
[4:32] now as i mentioned already
[4:34] this age has been called by the
[4:35] historians the period of reformation
[4:38] that is exactly right that is what it
[4:41] was it had to be that for martin luther
[4:43] was a reformer not a prophet
[4:46] now i know the history book calls him a
[4:48] prophet but it doesn't mean that the
[4:50] history book is right for there is no
[4:52] record of martin luther qualifying as a
[4:54] true prophet of god in the grand
[4:55] scriptural sense of that word
[4:58] he was a fine teacher with some of the
[5:00] manifestations of the spirit in his life
[5:02] and we praise god for that
[5:04] so he was not able to lead the church
[5:06] back to the whole truth as would a man
[5:08] like the apostle paul who was both
[5:09] apostle and prophet
[5:12] now as time went on we find a great
[5:15] change in the way he conducted the
[5:16] affairs in which he was involved
[5:19] at first he had been so gentle so
[5:20] fearless so patient and constantly
[5:23] waiting on god to work out the problems
[5:26] but then vast numbers began to come to
[5:28] his banner their purpose was not a truly
[5:30] spiritual one
[5:32] rather they had political motivations
[5:34] they wanted to break the yoke of the
[5:36] pope
[5:37] they disliked sending money to rome
[5:39] fanatics rose up soon he was dragged
[5:42] into political affairs and decisions
[5:44] that actually lay outside the realm of
[5:46] the church except that the church
[5:48] through prayer preaching and conduct
[5:50] might set up a standard to be heated
[5:52] these problems of politics mounted until
[5:55] he was forced into an untenable position
[5:57] of mediating between lords and peasants
[6:00] his decisions were so wrong that an
[6:02] uprising took place and thousands were
[6:04] killed
[6:05] he meant well
[6:06] but once he had let himself be entangled
[6:08] again in a church state gospel he had to
[6:11] reap the whirlwind
[6:13] but for all that god used martin luther
[6:16] let it not be said that his intentions
[6:18] were wrong
[6:19] let it only be said that his judgment
[6:21] failed
[6:22] truly if the lutherans could get back to
[6:24] his teaching and serve god as this
[6:26] gracious brother served him then that
[6:28] people would surely be a credit and
[6:30] praise to the great god and savior jesus
[6:32] christ
[6:35] the salutation
[6:38] revelation 3 1
[6:41] these things saith he that hath the
[6:42] seven spirits of god and the seven stars
[6:46] once again as in the previous four ages
[6:49] the spirit is revealing our gracious
[6:51] lord to us by setting forth his
[6:52] wonderful attributes
[6:54] this time as he is standing in the midst
[6:56] of the church
[6:57] we see him as the one with the seven
[6:59] spirits of god and the seven stars we
[7:02] know who the seven stars are
[7:04] but we will have to find what the seven
[7:06] spirits refer to
[7:09] this same phrase is found four times in
[7:11] the book of revelation
[7:13] revelation 1
[7:14] 4. from the seven spirits which are
[7:17] before his throne
[7:19] revelation 3 1
[7:22] these things saith he that hath the
[7:24] seven spirits
[7:26] revelation 4 5
[7:28] and out of the throne proceedeth
[7:30] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[7:33] and there were seven lamps of fire
[7:35] burning before the throne which are the
[7:36] seven spirits of god
[7:39] revelation 5 6
[7:42] and i beheld and blow in the midst of
[7:44] the throne and of the four beasts and in
[7:46] the midst of the elders stood a lamb as
[7:48] it had been slain having seven horns and
[7:51] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[7:53] of god sent forth into all the earth
[7:57] to begin with we know for a certainty
[7:59] that these verses are not teaching a new
[8:01] and contrary doctrine to john 4 24 a
[8:06] god is a
[8:07] one spirit
[8:09] but this is like first corinthians 12 8
[8:12] through 11 wherein we find one spirit
[8:15] manifesting himself in nine ways
[8:18] thus we know that the seven spirits of
[8:20] god mean it is the one and same spirit
[8:23] coming forth in a seven-fold way now in
[8:26] revelation four five
[8:28] these same seven spirits are called
[8:30] lamps of fire burning before the lord
[8:34] since john always used nothing but old
[8:36] testament symbols in the revelation we
[8:38] go to the old testament and find from
[8:40] proverbs 20 27 that
[8:43] the spirit of man is the lamp of the
[8:45] lord
[8:46] these seven spirits are found to be
[8:48] associated with man
[8:50] john the baptist in john 5 35 was called
[8:54] a burning light
[8:55] which should actually be translated as
[8:57] burning lamp
[8:59] again in revelation 5 6
[9:02] the seven spirits are identified as
[9:04] seven eyes
[9:05] in zechariah 4 10
[9:08] for who hath despised the day of small
[9:10] things
[9:11] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[9:13] plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with
[9:16] those seven they are the eyes of the
[9:18] lord
[9:19] it is very evident that the word they
[9:21] refers to men
[9:23] thus we see that the eyes of the lord in
[9:25] this instance are men
[9:27] of course they will be anointed men full
[9:29] of the holy ghost for god's ministries
[9:31] are not in the power of men but of the
[9:33] holy ghost
[9:34] putting our scriptural discoveries
[9:35] together it is evident that the seven
[9:37] spirits of god refer to the continuous
[9:40] ministry of the same holy spirit in the
[9:42] lives of seven men with whom god
[9:44] identifies himself very closely
[9:46] they are his eyes and they are his lamps
[9:50] who these seven men are can easily be
[9:52] seen because the next phrase calls them
[9:54] the seven stars which are already known
[9:56] to us as the seven messengers to the
[9:58] seven ages
[10:00] how beautiful that is
[10:02] see the star was meant to reflect light
[10:04] at night for the sun has gone
[10:07] just so the messenger typified as a star
[10:10] to each age was to reflect the light of
[10:12] the sun
[10:13] they all did this by the holy spirit
[10:16] paul was the first messenger and he said
[10:18] in galatians 1 8
[10:20] that if any angel any messenger any
[10:22] vicar no matter who he was
[10:24] if he preached any other gospel than
[10:26] what paul preached let him be accursed
[10:29] paul knew that after he was gone
[10:30] grievous wolves would come in
[10:32] he knew that satan himself could appear
[10:34] as an angel of light so how much more
[10:36] his ministers
[10:38] so he warns that this gospel would
[10:39] always be the same
[10:41] now paul had baptized in jesus name and
[10:44] rebaptized where people had not been so
[10:46] immersed
[10:47] he set the church in order and taught
[10:49] the proper use of the gifts of the
[10:50] spirit and confirmed that they were to
[10:52] remain in the church till jesus came
[10:55] thus the next messengers all the
[10:57] remaining six
[10:58] would by the same holy ghost burn with
[11:00] the same fire
[11:02] and give the same light of the gospel of
[11:04] jesus christ and the signs would follow
[11:06] them
[11:07] did irony is qualify
[11:09] yes did martin
[11:11] yes did columba yes
[11:14] did martin luther most assuredly did
[11:17] wesley
[11:18] yes sir he had a great ministry and even
[11:20] prayed for his horse to get well and it
[11:22] did
[11:23] there you are
[11:25] seven church ages and seven messengers
[11:27] who were alike
[11:28] and paul pronounced a curse on anyone
[11:30] who said he was a messenger but had a
[11:32] different gospel and lived in a
[11:34] different light
[11:36] now does that last statement of mind
[11:38] bear up with the rest of the word
[11:40] yes
[11:41] it says in the word that if any man adds
[11:44] to this book or takes from it he would
[11:46] be plagued and judged unto condemnation
[11:48] by god
[11:49] god said i will add the plagues written
[11:51] in this book or i will take his part out
[11:53] of the book of life
[11:55] revelation 22 18
[11:59] so we see that the seven spirits
[12:01] actually refer to the one spirit of god
[12:03] working out the will and word of god in
[12:05] different generations
[12:07] i would like to illustrate that from the
[12:09] word the spirit of god was mightily upon
[12:12] elijah
[12:13] then that same spirit came upon elisha
[12:15] in a two-fold effect
[12:17] then centuries later the same spirit
[12:19] which we call the spirit of elijah in
[12:21] order to describe its ministry came back
[12:24] upon john the baptist
[12:26] one day that same spirit identified by
[12:28] the same manner of ministry will come
[12:30] upon a man for the end of the gentile
[12:32] church age
[12:33] again the scripture says that god
[12:35] anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy
[12:37] ghost and power and he went about doing
[12:39] good healing all that were oppressed of
[12:42] the devil
[12:43] as jesus went away he told his disciples
[12:45] to tarry until pentecost at which time
[12:48] the very same spirit that was upon him
[12:50] would come back and fall upon them and
[12:52] fill them
[12:54] then that called out body the church
[12:57] would be in his stead upon the earth
[12:59] taking his place
[13:01] and because that same spirit that was in
[13:03] him would be in them they would do the
[13:05] very same works
[13:07] and any people that is truly the body of
[13:09] jesus christ the true church will
[13:12] manifest the same works as did jesus and
[13:15] the pentecostal church because the same
[13:17] spirit will be in them
[13:19] any other church that does not have the
[13:21] spirit and the manifestations is going
[13:22] to have to account to god
[13:26] it also says here that these seven stars
[13:28] or seven messengers to the seven ages
[13:30] are in his hand he is holding them you
[13:34] know right away that if they are held in
[13:36] his hand they are associated with his
[13:38] power
[13:39] that is what the hand signifies
[13:41] it signifies the power of god
[13:43] and authority of god
[13:45] not one of them came in his own power
[13:47] and authority that is what paul said
[13:51] no man would dare to
[13:53] it takes the authority of god and the
[13:55] power of the holy ghost
[13:57] the gospel is preached by the authority
[13:59] of god in the power of the spirit
[14:01] these men were all empowered by the holy
[14:03] ghost they all stood up to the world
[14:06] they could do that they were full of god
[14:09] they were sent or authorized by god not
[14:11] by self or other men
[14:14] now they had what the world could not
[14:16] have
[14:17] jesus said that when he went away he
[14:19] would send his spirit which the world
[14:21] could not receive
[14:23] that is right
[14:24] the world or world systems could not
[14:26] receive him
[14:28] that is what organization is it is world
[14:30] system
[14:32] show me a world system church that is
[14:34] full of the holy ghost i want to see it
[14:36] if you can show me such a church you are
[14:38] finding a mistake in the word
[14:40] no sir
[14:42] not one of these messengers was
[14:44] organized
[14:45] either they were put out or got out
[14:46] because they were convicted of the sin
[14:48] of organization
[14:50] how can the holy spirit possibly be an
[14:52] organization when it is organization
[14:54] that takes the place of the spirit and
[14:56] denominations take the place of the word
[14:58] remember
[15:00] organization is death
[15:02] it just can't be any other way
[15:04] if the world takes over the spirit
[15:06] departs
[15:08] yes the spirit is not seven spirits but
[15:11] one he will always be the same and act
[15:13] the same
[15:14] and the seven messengers will have the
[15:16] same spirit and teach the same word and
[15:19] have the same power
[15:20] and if the church is the true church it
[15:22] will have the very same spirit and word
[15:24] and acts of power that they had at
[15:26] pentecost
[15:28] by experience it will be a pentecostal
[15:30] church and there will be tongues and
[15:32] interpretation and prophecy and healings
[15:35] god will be in the midst of her and god
[15:37] will declare himself in the midst of her
[15:39] as he always has hallelujah and she will
[15:42] be unorganized don't forget that
[15:47] now we can see that jesus christ is
[15:49] revealing himself through the ages by
[15:50] his spirit in the messengers
[15:52] they are as moses was to the children of
[15:54] israel
[15:55] as he had the revelation for his day so
[15:58] each messenger had god's revelation and
[16:00] ministry for that day
[16:02] thus when we see that the messengers are
[16:04] in his hand we see the lord identifying
[16:07] himself with these men and granting them
[16:09] his power
[16:10] it is not enough that he has associated
[16:12] himself with the whole church which we
[16:14] saw when he was seen standing amongst
[16:16] the seven golden lampstands
[16:19] nor is it even enough that we see the
[16:20] five-fold ministry of ephesians four
[16:23] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[16:26] pastors
[16:27] for in each age the church goes astray
[16:30] and it is not just the laity but the
[16:32] clergy group
[16:33] shepherds are wrong as well as sheep
[16:36] then god brings himself on the scene as
[16:38] the chief shepherd in the ministries of
[16:40] these seven men to lead his people back
[16:42] to the truth and the abundant power of
[16:44] that truth
[16:45] god is in his people
[16:47] all of his people for if any man has not
[16:50] the spirit of christ he is none of his
[16:53] and he is the word
[16:56] that would be the word recognized in the
[16:58] people
[16:59] but he has placed a special leadership
[17:00] in these men of his own choosing and
[17:03] through the determined counsel of his
[17:04] own will
[17:05] they appear once in each age
[17:08] it is the same spirit in them
[17:10] what a far cry is this from the heresy
[17:12] of rome
[17:13] they have a man of their own choosing
[17:15] one after the other
[17:17] none producing the power of god none
[17:19] abiding in the word of god
[17:21] each one differing from the one before
[17:23] him and adding what he desires as though
[17:25] he were god
[17:27] god is not in it
[17:29] but he is in his messenger and he who
[17:32] would have the fullness of god would
[17:33] follow the messenger as the messenger is
[17:35] a follower of the lord by his word
[17:39] he that hath the seven spirits of god
[17:41] and the seven stars
[17:43] revelation 3
[17:45] 1 as this same lord identified himself
[17:48] with man in the incarnation
[17:50] he is again identifying himself with man
[17:52] by his spirit within man
[17:54] these are mine saith the lord
[17:57] the seven spirit-filled messengers are
[17:59] the lords they may be repudiated they
[18:02] may be questioned
[18:03] indeed to human minds they may not even
[18:06] seem to qualify
[18:07] nevertheless they are the messengers for
[18:09] their age
[18:10] god used an abraham he lied he used a
[18:14] moses he rebelled a jonah he disobeyed
[18:18] a samson
[18:20] he sinned
[18:21] a david he murdered
[18:24] he also used a joshua and a joseph
[18:26] and those with severe blemishes far
[18:28] outnumber those whose histories seem to
[18:30] be perfect
[18:32] all were and are his
[18:35] none dare deny that
[18:37] he used them by and through the holy
[18:39] spirit that he put within them
[18:41] to their own master they stood or fell
[18:44] and in them always accomplished the
[18:46] sovereign will of god
[18:48] let external history attempt to refute
[18:50] this it still stands
[18:52] the eternal god still walks amongst the
[18:54] golden lamp stands and sends his
[18:56] messengers by his spirit with the word
[18:58] to the people of every age
[19:01] the denunciation
[19:03] revelation three
[19:05] one be
[19:07] i know thy works that thou has a name
[19:09] that thou livest and art dead
[19:11] revelation 3 2 be
[19:14] for i have not found thy works perfect
[19:16] before god
[19:18] now here indeed is a very strange thing
[19:21] in every age to this point the spirit
[19:23] has first of all praised the true
[19:25] believers
[19:26] and then denounced the false vine
[19:28] but in this period there is evidently
[19:30] such want and disregard for the lord and
[19:32] his word that the entire message to this
[19:35] fifth age rings with condemnation
[19:38] i know thy works
[19:40] what were these works that came up
[19:42] before the lord and caused his
[19:43] displeasure
[19:44] well you know that each age lapped over
[19:46] into the next age so we have a
[19:48] continuation of the works of the fourth
[19:50] age into the fifth these works as you
[19:53] are well aware were
[19:55] one
[19:56] the leadership of the holy spirit was
[19:57] superseded by a human hierarchy
[20:00] two
[20:01] the pure word of god and its free
[20:03] benefit to all men was deposed for
[20:05] creeds dogmas church orders etc
[20:09] three
[20:10] the worship in the spirit and gifts of
[20:12] the spirit and all that which pertains
[20:14] to true community fellowship of the
[20:16] saints was cast aside for liturgy and
[20:18] literal idol worship pagan feasts etc
[20:22] four
[20:24] mary olitree was assuming a greater
[20:26] place in the christian worship until she
[20:28] had actually assumed a place of godhead
[20:30] and the son was brought from his lofty
[20:32] position of over all to being
[20:34] subservient to a man called the pope who
[20:36] termed himself the vicar of christ
[20:40] those who fought this terrible
[20:42] antichrist church were destroyed
[20:44] those who stayed with it found
[20:46] themselves the pawn of the church
[20:47] whether they be peasants or kings
[20:49] their lives were not their own and
[20:51] neither were their lives christ's but
[20:53] they belonged body soul and spirit to
[20:56] the church of rome
[20:57] they talked about the blood of christ
[21:00] yet they purchased their salvation with
[21:01] money
[21:02] and bought forgiveness of sins either by
[21:04] gold or penance
[21:05] the wealthier of them founded a happy
[21:07] situation when pope leo the tenth
[21:10] allowed them to buy indulgences for sins
[21:12] not yet committed so that they with ease
[21:14] of conscience could plan their awful
[21:16] crimes and then proceed to carry them
[21:18] out
[21:18] knowing that the pope had already
[21:20] remitted their sins
[21:22] the word of god was kept from them so
[21:24] who was to know the truth
[21:26] since truth comes only from the word the
[21:28] people were shut up in a dungeon of the
[21:30] roman church awaiting death and after
[21:33] death the judgment
[21:35] but the great drunk with the blood
[21:37] of martyrs and with no thought of the
[21:39] judgment reeled savagely on to kill men
[21:41] with both spiritual and physical death
[21:45] now toward the end of the fourth age
[21:46] which would be the beginning of the
[21:48] fifth age also
[21:49] the invasion of constantinople by the
[21:51] turks sent the learned scholars of the
[21:53] east with their greek manuscripts to the
[21:55] west
[21:56] the purity of the word and the teachings
[21:58] of true believers were thus disseminated
[22:01] and not only were these fine teachers of
[22:03] great importance but also the invention
[22:05] of what became the basis of our modern
[22:07] printing presses was discovered
[22:09] facilitating the production of books
[22:12] thus we find the great hunger and demand
[22:14] for the bible could be answered
[22:16] god raised up many mighty men of which
[22:18] luther was but one
[22:20] calvin and swingley were two other
[22:21] luminaries and besides these were many
[22:23] many more who are not so well known
[22:27] however though all this was not in vain
[22:29] the mighty work of god was actually
[22:31] hindered by these very men
[22:33] for one thing they did not oppose the
[22:35] church state marriage of the nicene
[22:37] council but actually fostered that union
[22:41] the defense of the gospel by the state
[22:43] was welcomed though there was no word
[22:44] for it and though we can see the wrath
[22:47] of man praising god in such events as
[22:50] henry viii taking up for the reformation
[22:52] and the rejection of papal authority it
[22:54] was a far cry from the truth of
[22:56] pentecost and protection of an
[22:58] omnipotent god
[23:00] in spite of luther's constant teaching
[23:02] against outside interference in local
[23:04] church matters he was not able to clear
[23:06] men's minds of the bishop
[23:08] archbishop concept of church government
[23:11] thus the church took one step in the
[23:13] right direction but still remained
[23:15] shackled so in short order she was again
[23:17] imprisoned in the same dungeon when she
[23:19] had attempted to escape still the cup of
[23:22] the abominable works was not yet full
[23:25] not only did luther through poor
[23:27] judgment insight to battle and thereby
[23:29] caused the death of multitudes but
[23:31] singley's party persecuted unto prison
[23:33] the godly doctor hub
[23:35] and though it did not commit him to the
[23:37] stake it was actually responsible in
[23:39] great measure for his eventual death by
[23:41] fire
[23:42] and calvin did no less for he demanded
[23:45] the arrest of servitus who had seen and
[23:48] taught the oneness of the godhead
[23:50] the state then tried this brother and to
[23:53] calvin's dismay he was burned at the
[23:54] stake
[23:56] if there was ever a time of
[23:57] denominational zeal it was at this
[23:59] tragic time
[24:01] the words of comenius describe much of
[24:03] this era
[24:04] comenius wrote the one thing needful
[24:08] he compares the world to the labyrinth
[24:10] and shows that the way out is by leaving
[24:12] what is needless and choosing the one
[24:14] thing needful
[24:16] christ
[24:17] the great number of teachers he says is
[24:19] the reason of the multitudes of sects
[24:22] for which we shall soon have no names
[24:24] left
[24:25] each church reckons itself as the true
[24:27] one or at least as the purest truest
[24:30] part of it while among themselves they
[24:32] persecute each other with the bitterest
[24:34] hatred
[24:35] no reconciliation is to be hoped for
[24:37] between them
[24:39] they meet enmity with irreconcilable
[24:40] enmity
[24:42] out of the bible they forge their
[24:43] different creeds
[24:45] these are their fortresses and bulwarks
[24:47] behind which they entrench themselves
[24:49] and resist all attacks
[24:51] i will not say that these confessions of
[24:53] faith for we can admit in most cases
[24:55] that they are so are bad in themselves
[24:58] they become so however in that they feed
[25:00] the fire of enmity
[25:02] only by putting them away altogether
[25:04] would it be possible to set to work on
[25:06] healing the wounds of the church
[25:08] to this labyrinth of sects and various
[25:10] confessions and other belongs the love
[25:13] of disputation
[25:14] what is attained by it
[25:16] has a single learned strife ever been
[25:18] settled
[25:19] never
[25:20] their number has only been increased
[25:23] satan is the greatest softest he has
[25:26] never been overcome in a strife of words
[25:28] in divine service the words of men are
[25:30] usually heard more than the word of god
[25:33] each one chatters as he pleases for
[25:35] kills time by learned disquisitions and
[25:37] disproving the views of others
[25:40] of the new birth and how a man must be
[25:42] changed into the likeness of christ to
[25:44] become partaker of the divine nature
[25:46] second peter 1 4 scarcely anything is
[25:50] said
[25:51] of the power of the keys the church has
[25:53] almost lost the power of binding only
[25:56] the power of loosing remains
[25:58] the sacraments given as symbols of unity
[26:00] of love and of our life in christ have
[26:03] been made the occasion of bitterest
[26:05] conflict a cause of mutual hatred a
[26:08] center of sectarianism
[26:10] in short christendom has become a
[26:12] labyrinth
[26:14] the faith has been split into a thousand
[26:15] little parts and you are made a heretic
[26:17] if there is one of them you do not
[26:19] accept
[26:20] what can help
[26:22] only the one thing needful return to
[26:24] christ looking to christ as the only
[26:26] leader and walking in his footsteps
[26:29] setting aside all other ways until we
[26:31] reach the goal and have come to the
[26:33] unity of the faith
[26:35] ephesians 4
[26:36] 13. as the heavenly master built
[26:39] everything on the ground of the
[26:40] scriptures so should we leave all
[26:42] particularities of our special
[26:44] confessions and be satisfied with the
[26:45] revealed word of god which belongs to us
[26:48] all
[26:49] with the bible in our hand we should cry
[26:51] i believe what god has revealed in this
[26:54] book i will obediently keep his commands
[26:57] i hope for that which he has promised
[26:59] christians give ear there is only one
[27:02] life but death comes to us in a thousand
[27:04] forms there is only one christ but a
[27:07] thousand antichrists
[27:09] so thou knowest o christendom what is
[27:11] the one thing needful
[27:13] either thou turnest back to christ or
[27:15] thou goest to destruction like the
[27:17] antichrist if thou art wise and wilt
[27:19] live follow the leader of life
[27:22] but you christians rejoice in your being
[27:24] caught up
[27:26] hear the words of your heavenly leader
[27:28] come unto me
[27:29] answer with one voice even so we come
[27:33] [Music]
[27:59] you
