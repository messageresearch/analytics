[music] Thank you Lord. And hold [singing] it in you we [music] find peace. covers me. Lord covers [music] me. Amen. [music] Praise the Lord. Let's go back to Psalm chapter 103. We read from there last uh Wednesday night. We want to go back to that part that we dwell on. Psalm 13. Praise the Lord. Psalm 103 want to read from verse one. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget that all his benefits. Who forgaveth all thine iniquities, who health all thy diseases, who redeemth the life from destruction, who crown thee with loving kindness in t of mercy, who satisfy the mouth with good things, so that their youth is renewed like the eagle. The Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. He make known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and plenturious in mercy. Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word. You may have your seat. Amen. You may have your seat. I want to start off tonight uh by just uh reading a quote from uh straight is the gate. It's [clears throat] a kind of a prayer but uh um I love the last line there. So we we just want to uh start up tonight by reading this. We pray Lord that [clears throat] there that there will not be a person leave here but what will be filled with your spirit. Maybe there won't be one emotion from the outside when it happen but Lord go on the inside. Pull off the shared and show us what we are. Lord grant it and then fill us with your spirit with our heart with our heart that's true and pure. And in this time of persecution and hard trials you will grow sweeter and dearer to us as we walk alone waiting for that day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Waiting for that day. Tonight I I read his quote uh because I I was almost driven to speak on uh the reaction of the church on the pressure or on trials or on the persecution. But I thought I should come back to where we stopped on Wednesday night last week and just start from there. But uh uh just in line with uh with this thought year, brother Ram says, "And in this time of tri and uh and uh persecution and hard triumph, we will grow sweeter and dear and you will grow sweeter and dearer to us as we walk alone waiting for that day." Now so uh uh uh you see when when uh most of the time when we when we talk about the church being on the persecution uh many times is uh you know it's is so easy for it to be related to us uh you know taking away our religious right we you know we I mean maybe not coming to church or one thing or the other but you know whenever we have uh we have uh uh national disturbances or we have uh uh pestilence like the time of co and and all of that when when this when these kind of a things take place in the nation you know it also bring the church on a trial praise the lord uh in in a sense there is uh we we are humans you know we we are you know we are living in the society we have to work and uh we we have to go to school we have to take care of our families and different things that we do. So when when we have you know a kind of a national thing going on or a statewide thing going on I mean just like uh we had you know the George Floyd thing and different thing is it's uh it's is in one sense it brings us to a place of trial because uh uh it's it's easy for us to get under uh a little sense of uh fear and and and panic which of course as human you know that's that's something that is normal but uh uh the the the the side of it that I want for us to look at is that the we must remember that whenever uh you know uh uh the the church or the the nation comes on a uh crisis like this is is also an opportunity for the church for the people of God to experience God's supernatural praise the Lord &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Because we must realize that we have a promise that he said he would never leave us and he would never forsake us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have a promise that he said he will watch over our going out and our coming in. Now, now I mean we we we realize that we must take all of these things with wisdom and know how we go about doing whatever we going about to do. But the the portion of this that I want to get to is that we feed our mind with so much things from the media that it affect us and pretty soon we start panicking. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I mean uh when when actually in some sense we don't have no reason to panic because uh I mean we are not running into the street. We are not going about doing things that we not supposed to do. And uh uh actually we supposed to be on uh on uh uh on the front line. We supposed to be on the ground of prayers, you know, and just and just praying for people that are out there, praying for our loved ones, praying for our children and praying for one another. But uh uh I mean now with uh with uh uh uh our our our cell phones, we have we have all of these uh news feed that is coming in. I mean we can get them in the second, we can get them in the meaning, we can even get them life as they are going live &gt;&gt; and uh and pretty soon we spend much of the time doing they feeding our mind with what is happening out there and and and uh and our body gets under the condition because our our spirit has been so much filled with those things. Now it start affecting us that uh we have some sense of panic and fear. But on the other side of it is that we must realize that uh uh uh similar thing like this took place in Egypt just at a time when uh uh uh Moses was born. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. that the parents uh by prayer and believing in God, they were able to put their little baby into uh a little basket and throw him on the alligator river and they saw the supernatural of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, so if uh if if if we as uh as uh as as children of God and as people of God can just be able to take the right kind of a attitude in in in time like this. Uh it's is in time like this where God would like to send a message and says uh well uh uh sister you call uh uh brother war and tell him he must not go to this place or brother uh brother this you call this brother and tell those are things that the holy ghost can stay do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But I mean when when we are just all filling our minds, I mean we have all become news reporters, you know, and and and and and that's what we are spending our time doing. Then no wonder we would definitely be on a panic and fear. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will definitely be on a panic and fear. It have a beginning, it will have an end. Praise the Lord. And as long as we live on this earth, we might go into worse things. &gt;&gt; You know, we might go into worse things. Some of us that live in war to countries uh uh I mean when bullets were shooting and rockets were flying, we were still going to church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is just it just uh you know uh knowing that God in his mercy, you know, uh uh uh uh he he has a provision for his people. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, I just thought that uh we we start off like this. I I I thought I would talk a whole lot on that, but uh uh we'll keep that for another time. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to see, you know, uh uh uh the Lord dealing with us, moving in our midst. I mean it's uh it all happens when we prepare ourselves because God is moving all the time. &gt;&gt; You know, God is speaking all the time. &gt;&gt; You know, he's he's uh he's he's dealing with his people. Praise the Lord. I mean, Sister K sent her her praise report on Sunday. You know, she was panicking with her uh you know, losing her insurance and her primary medication going up to $800. And and uh I mean uh uh I heard about it, never spoke to her directly. I think I've heard my wife was talking about it and and uh and I was I was also in that same mindset because I was thinking about the many people that had to deal with uh you know uh uh changes of medication, losing their insurance and all of that. and uh and you know we took a we took a prayer that that was where I based my thought of this uh Psalm chapter 103 last week and I think it was on Friday or just before the weekend she you know she called and and uh uh you know and she experienced that having a discount or something that will have cost her 800 plus dollars she had to payundred I don't know 150 or how much it is so I mean uh the Lord know our needs praise the Lord &gt;&gt; he knows our needs. Uh uh he knows that uh uh I mean this is not something that uh uh uh we we have brought upon ourself. Let uh you know let the people that are sound today take care of that. Let's take care of our own business. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's take care of our own business. We know that uh we have been commissioned by the word to stay in prayer. Pray for one another you know uh encourage one another. Let's build our faith in time like this. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So last week we were talking looking right down here in uh in verse seven. That's where we were kind of basing our thought here in verse 7. He made known his ways unto Moses and his eyes unto the children of Israel. and uh and and and uh this this is a subject this is a psalm that uh that is that is that is greatly used for on on the basis of of healing you know uh the Lord that health us of all our diseases and he he forgiveth all our iniquities praise the lord amen he redeemed our life from destruction he crowned us with his loving kindness and his tend of mercy But uh uh we were looking a little bit into uh how uh you know as as the people of God we we we we gravitate to the acts of the Lord. You know we we want God to do things. We want God we want to see the manifestation of God. We we want to bring as we bring our prayer needs uh uh uh we we we we listening for testimony and and uh uh uh you know our sister on hospice you know that the doctor has has given her 10 days to live. We believe that God can can can spare her many more days just like he did to Hezekiah. You see and and as a people of God we we we you know we look to the acts of God. We want to see God in action. But we must also understand here like the scripture says, he make known his ways unto Moses. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And in God's ways, we realize that's where his thoughts, his purpose, because behind every act and everything that the Lord allowed, the Bible says there will not be a war in the city if the Lord do not allow it. And that's what the scripture says. &gt;&gt; Now, so if the Lord allow it, then we realize that &gt;&gt; he has a purpose &gt;&gt; like he said in Jeremiah, I know the thoughts that I think towards you. &gt;&gt; They are not the thoughts of evil. So God has a purpose and and that is what uh uh we want to realize here that uh uh uh and and and these are some of the things that we see here that as we look in the scripture here the Bible is making us to re to to see that just like with the children of Israel they saw the ways of God they saw the plagues falling in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They saw the water turn into blood. They saw the the the frogs, the fleas and everything that were happening in Egypt. They saw in Gush and there was like that. That was the act of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But we have to realize that uh before any of those judgment fell down, God spoke to Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he would tell Moses, "Go back to to to Pharaoh because he's not listening. I have hide in his heart &gt;&gt; that he's not going to let you go. You go back to Pharaoh. I'm going to make him to see my judgment. Now, the children of Israel, they were not they were not in that conversation. They were not seeing what God was revering to Moses. The reason why God kept bringing the plague, they were not seeing it. All they were hearing in the news is that, "Oh yeah, you hear the water have turned into blood. Oh, you hear the palace is filled with frogs." Those are the things that they were hearing. They were they were hearing and they were seeing with their eyes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God was making known his ways. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was revealing to the prophet that his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was revealing to his prophet his purpose. So and and and and and uh uh uh coming coming under a prophetic ministry a it it makes us to be able to learn. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It make us to learn the ways of God &gt;&gt; that we we are not just uh h ordinary people or just just Christians that only rejoice in the acts of God. No, &gt;&gt; we just want arts. We want arts. We want arts and not understanding. What is his purpose? &gt;&gt; What is his thought? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if not, we will rejoice in his blessings. &gt;&gt; Yes. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And then when he allow trials to to come our way where we should be able to build character, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; we will lose it. We will misbehave &gt;&gt; because our mindset will be as children of God, it must just be blessing and blessing God. I mean, God is not a grandfather that that spoil his children. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's a God of discipline. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And now understanding and knowing those things, then it make us to be able to understand his ways. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. that he has a purpose behind everything that he's that he does and if he allows something in our life, he want us to understand his ways. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not that our prayers are falling to the ground or or his ears is too heavy to hear our prayers, but he want us to learn his ways. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; You see, that's the reason why this this generation is a sign seeking generation, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, they it's a signseeking generation. They want signs. They want miracles until if they don't have it from God, they have to fake it &gt;&gt; because that's the way they understand God. &gt;&gt; Every service must be a miracle service. &gt;&gt; Every service must be a healing service. So if they don't if they don't have it, if they don't have the genuine one, they will have to fake it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I will tell you that if God don't does if he if he don't do one more miracle in your life, &gt;&gt; he will still remain the same real &gt;&gt; almighty God, the creator of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because if God don't give you one miracle and he gave you an understanding why he don't give you that miracle, it's more beneficial to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he heals your body and you get sick again, &gt;&gt; come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He make known his ways to Moses in his acts to the children of Israel. So we read a few of these things and and uh uh last Wednesday also was a prayer meeting and we we taught how to keep you long. So we we weren't rushing over them. So I would just I would just run over them like we pressed last week looking to the unseen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we and we are thinking of a day that has gone where God moves in a manner to reveal himself to men. To make his ways known unto men through his servants, the prophets. He make known his ways unto men through his servants, the prophets. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We also read this uh uh accepting God's provided way at the end time. I ask you as a believer, don't you move, sit still, and you believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. that I'm here to make known his work and his ways. I have been reluctant on these things the the 15 16 years I have been on the field but there is an hour coming now when something is fixing to take place. So brother expressing your uh reluctance to to be able to say certain things to the people make be able to make the people grab the people attention to certain things. He said but the hour is coming now you know that something is fixing to happen. So I'm you know I'm I'm trying to to make you understand make known unto you you know his works and his ways. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Make known unto you his works and his ways. You see, because when you understand God's ways, if you understand God's ways, you will know that when God is silent, that's the time where he's working. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You know uh uh uh like a brother said he says uh you know u when we when we talk about the silence we we we make it so mysterious because we tie a whole lot to revelation you know chapter chapter 8 you know we uh uh when the seven seals were open you know there was silence you know there was no one on the throne you know the the mighty angel come down we we tie it to lot of those mysterious things that sometimes we really don't know what the silence of God is, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, we really don't know what the silence of God is. Let me let me take this other one again. For him will I accept. And year when our heavenly father year at the platform will do something in the audience and he will confirm it or make known his ways or heal the people or something and then you see that that that's the truth and yeah people come and everything. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when when I first look at this whole thing I was I was really looking at it in the in a in a you know on the subject of healing. I was looking at it on the subject of healing because I think that is where one of the greatest misunderstanding that is in the church. Praise the Lord. That is that is where one of the greatest misunderstanding that is in the church because when we when we deal with uh the subject of healing you know uh uh uh uh like we we share with you here uh the son of righteousness rising with healing in its wings the church operating under the full anointing even in healing you know so there is there's a time where you know the church experience divine healing That's uh that's under the ego's anointing. The the the the Holy Ghost comes down. The presence of God is there. The sickness disappear. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Someone lying on the court rise up again. We know that uh that's that that is a miracle. Praise the Lord. That's supernatural. And it is as much as supernatural when a person goes under the man's anointing which will be on a man's wisdom going to the doctor for the surgery that is also supernatural because the doctors can put the the the the tissues together but God will have to do the healing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So just as uh divine healing and miracle is supernatural when when a person goes for surgery and the doctor take whatever they have to take out of their body and God comes down and heal them heal the wounds for them to be able to live a good healthy life that is just as supernatural as as a as a sickness getting out of a person body &gt;&gt; because the Church have not known the ways of God. &gt;&gt; We only stop healing to divine healing. &gt;&gt; We only think that it's a divine healing or it's a miracle when the sickness disappear. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It as much as healing and and and divine to God when it's under the OX ANOINTING THAT GOD GIVE a man or give a woman faith TO BE THEIR BODY is in pain but yet instead there's a faith in their heart that make them to keep believing God and keep trusting God. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because the people have not understand the ways of God. &gt;&gt; And that's that's the thing that has made all the the copycats &gt;&gt; and the charastic word and and and and and all the fake healing and and all the healing ministry that have popped up in our days is all measuring only one thing that is on their mind. It's miracle. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's miracle. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They will never take uh they will never think and consider in their mind that it is only God that heal. &gt;&gt; And if God choose to heal through surgery, IT'S GOD THAT HEAL. &gt;&gt; To him is supernatural. If he choose to heal through music, to him is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he make known his way to a prophet and a prophet has taught us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. [clears throat] Then Jesus came close here and allowed you to go home. Jesus knew what the father will was. Oh and oh what a blessed privilege it is that we can know the father will. If we will seek God, God will make known his will. &gt;&gt; I did rather know that I am in the will of God if I never spoke to another person. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Than to preach to 10,000 people every night and out of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I rather know the word of God and believe that it that it was David that said I rather be a doat. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Or something at the at the at the house of my Lord than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now because the people don't know uh h uh the ways of God, his will is declared in his ways &gt;&gt; because God is known by his characteristics. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So because uh uh uh uh they have now known the ways of God, we we we see the the the the amount of wickedness just like David said yet, I'd rather be in the word of God. I'd rather be a dome than to be in a tent of wickedness. And that's what uh a bunch of our our uh you know rel religious cycles have turned out to be a tense of wickedness. &gt;&gt; We lie to to the people. We deceive them. We give them false hope instead of instructing them &gt;&gt; in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's it's it's to be able to see you know that uh uh uh uh and and and and and God in his heart he has uh he has he has different way different manifestation for my father Bible says the ways of the Lord are pass funny out. Amen. &gt;&gt; His ways are passed funny out. Actually there in the book of Exodus we learn that uh God in his ways he pass is done &gt;&gt; before we even know that it's done &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; Moses said I want to see you God. He said okay you stand on the rock &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; wait for me and and and uh and he's paying all of his attention. God has come and pass. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Moses said his back was was like the back of a man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He would have saw the backpack which mean God has already passed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He has already done it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, but uh h uh uh uh we we we get so so so so limited and so so much operating by our five senses, you know. We want to see it there. We want to feel it. and and uh h you know and and taste it or smell it before we know that it is God and God operate far beyond our five senses. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He operate far beyond our five senses. So that's that's what the word in every age you know he make known his ways unto men through his servants the prophets. Praise the Lord for the people. Can you imagine after after the people have gone many years, many years, you know, Moses, the last time they had a man coming from the presence of the Lord to tell them anything was Joshua. In the whole time of uh of uh of uh of the judges, there were only there were only minor prophets on the scene because there's a prophet that came and spoke to Gideon. And uh uh uh but since that time, the people never had a man that had an open vision, a man that the word of God was coming to real and clear until Samuel came on the scene. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you remember uh uh uh Samuel met Saul when actually he was on on the hunt of looking for his father. [clears throat] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And they told him that you know you will meet the prophet and when you meet that prophet he will tell you exactly where the animal is. That was something that was very real in Israel at that time. They had just come from under the the the period of time where the Bible says every man ways was right in their own eyes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. the people the they the the faction their own way of worship you know the the the build molten images and and and different thing you know they just faction God to their mind &gt;&gt; yeah come on &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; and I and and and it's it's it's almost like that feeling of the same thing is happening around us people just faction God I call into their mind &gt;&gt; amen they they make their own god God in in their own understanding that they cannot be able to uh embrace God's word, embrace his instruction to really be able to experience him in his ways. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To experience him in his manifestation. So what happen is that we make a certain thing and WE TRY LET'S TRY it and see if if if we experience God. Come on now. And then we come up with another thing again and say let's let's try it and see if we experience God. &gt;&gt; We are fracturing our own image according to our imagination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he make known his ways &gt;&gt; to his servants the prophet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. As we listen to to the to the voice of God and and and listen to how God uh h dealt with his servant in this age, we can realize we we we can learn God's ways. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can learn the ways of God, the way he would do things and the reason why he would do things. Like like I said on on uh on Sunday, brother B, they're talking about that young lady [clears throat] that has backslided and she went away from God and and and you know and and you know and and and uh uh you know she she got horribly sick and all of that. uh we know the story there from warning and judgment and the the family came and and asked for prayer and you know and and she was prayed for you know she got back to serving the Lord and uh and and and just in that time you know uh uh she went to be with the Lord and which of course even at that time it it kind of a touch brother Brandon I mean she was she was she was just at a good place now uh I mean why why did Lord take her life. He went praying and you know and and then God make known his ways unto her &gt;&gt; unto him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He make known his ways unto him in so much at a place where the Lord kind of for sure show at the time that she was backslided from the Lord. Uh uh being a daughter of God, she was not ready to go home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we understand his ways. Brother Benham understand that you say, "Oh God, have mercy upon me. Who am I a sinner to even question you?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But is God making known his ways? &gt;&gt; Because if we don't understand the ways of God, we will misjudge his hearts. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no way we will understand his heart because we will rejoice in one and then get discouraged in the other. &gt;&gt; David said he satisfied our mouth with good things so that our youth is renewed like the eagle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; So our our our youth is renewed as a eagle. So as we as we just uh uh uh think about this tonight uh that's that's that's what I want wanted to bring to us for us to be able to to capture that in our mind. God is identified by his characteristics. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is identified by his ways and his ways are pass finding out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But if we if we can trust him, if we can can can can can can fall in love with him. Praise the Lord. after after he have moved and and and he have dealt with us in certain ways, surely he going to bring us to an understanding. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's going to bring us to an understanding why he allow certain things to happen, why he deal with us in certain ways. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh and and that's that's what we that's what we need because uh the truth about the matter that is that uh when we going through uh you know uh uh uh uh different face and many things that we are dealing with. Uh just like I said from the beginning, many of us cannot handle God silence. We can't handle it. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh and and and also look at it when you even look at it in a sense of the church ages, the opening of the seals. And the Bible would talk there in Revelation chapter 7 and says there was there was there was silence in heaven. Now that could not come that that that that manifestation that happening. It could not come when the church was just in its infancy. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what children cannot handle silence. &gt;&gt; No, children cannot handle silence. The way they are made h the energy that is within them, they can't handle silence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You tell them to sit there, they sit quiet in in a little bit they jump up and they are moving up and down. If you are quiet and come around and say sir papa are you okay? Why? Because they are comp they are trying to compare their energy with yours. They are moving around and you are not doing anything. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So sometimes it takes some growing up &gt;&gt; for people to understand what silence is. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I will tell you, silence can be loud. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Silence can be loud. &gt;&gt; Well, we'll leave that for another day. &gt;&gt; The time is fast. &gt;&gt; We We'll take a time uh uh settle some things on on on talking about silence, dealing with silence. So, uh, we'll find some time and talk about that tonight. We just wanted to use this time and, uh, uh, pick up these different needs. I wanted to also use this time to encourage you that it's not time for you to just soak your mind into panic. That's not what that's not that's not what God is expecting of us in this time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You have to know that the church is is God's institute is God's community to be able to handle these kind of things. We supposed to be standing in a gap and you know and and holding to the horns of the altar and say, "Oh God, have mercy upon the people." Lord, if they only knew what what a time is this and and you know and and and just praying to God and praying for one another, praying for the leaders and praying for you know uh everything that is going on. and giving our mind over to social media. &gt;&gt; And feeding ourself with fear. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't want to reduce our God &gt;&gt; to a disabled being. &gt;&gt; Our God is more than able. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Shedra, Michel, Benedict say he's able to deliver us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's able to deliver us. &gt;&gt; And even if he don't, we not going to deny him &gt;&gt; because our Lord is more than able. &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come. Let's uh let's just uh take our hearts to the Lord and be able to speak to him personally tonight and just ask him to help us. &gt;&gt; You know, we there is there is a there's an attitude that is expected of us. There's a behavior that is expected of us. There is there is our we have a responsibility to this age to this generation you know to our city you know we might be a small group of people but the people that understand God's words you know the people that understand God's way being instructed on a prophetic ministry we must have a better behavior. We must deal with these kind of a things better than we are dealing with. &gt;&gt; Amen. It might not just be a a a conversation of uh you know we just we are we are just furing out negative things and furing out fear and just we're fearing out I mean mercy must be proceeding for us. There must be a group of people standing in the gap and say Lord have mercy. Let's bow our house together tonight. Jesus [singing] keep me in the air. the cross.
