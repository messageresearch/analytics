[3:04] All things are possible. Supernatural,
[3:10] the life of William Brham. This is the
[3:12] most phenomenal true story you will ever
[3:15] read. It will change the way you think
[3:17] about the world you live in and the
[3:20] world
[3:22] beyond. Chapter 1. Mysterious birth
[3:25] sign. Covering the years 1909 to
[3:29] 1912. 15 is not too young to have a
[3:32] baby, muttered Ella Branom to herself,
[3:34] trying to bolster her courage. Why, I'm
[3:36] just as ready as the pain struck again,
[3:40] stronger, more commanding than before.
[3:42] Ella felt her panic rise with a
[3:44] spreading discomfort. She held her
[3:47] swollen stomach and groaned, "Not yet.
[3:50] Please, not yet. Not until Charles comes
[3:53] home." Beads of sweat popped out in her
[3:56] forehead. She staggered across the dirt
[3:59] floor to the cabin's only window, set in
[4:01] the middle of a crude wooden door. The
[4:04] window had no glass, only a wooden
[4:06] shutter, which Ella left open during the
[4:08] day and closed at night. Now it was
[4:12] open. "Charles!" she screamed. Her voice
[4:15] seemed to evaporate into the Kentucky
[4:17] back woods, with his vast expanse of
[4:20] hills and hollows stretching out from
[4:22] her in every direction. "Knowing her
[4:25] nearest neighbor lived miles away made
[4:27] Ella feel desperately alone." The pain
[4:30] tightened around her stomach, driving
[4:31] her into a panic. "Charles!" she
[4:34] screamed again. "Charles, where are
[4:37] you?" Then her voice sank into a feeble
[4:40] sob. Please come home. I need you.
[4:44] Charles Brandham had received his
[4:46] logging pay that morning and had walked
[4:48] into Burksville, Kentucky to buy a new
[4:50] pair of bib overalls in honor of my
[4:52] first child, he said. But what was
[4:55] keeping him so long? Had he gotten
[4:58] waylaid by a tavern? If so, it would not
[5:01] have been the first time in their
[5:02] one-year marriage. But surely Charles
[5:05] wouldn't do such a thing today. He knew
[5:07] their baby was due any time. The
[5:10] contraction subsided, leaving her spent.
[5:13] Ellis sagged against the splintery door
[5:15] jam, watching the sun settle behind the
[5:17] maples and oaks that had just begun to
[5:20] bud. It was April in the year 1909. Ella
[5:24] shivered as she closed the
[5:26] shutter. Now the only light in the cabin
[5:29] came from the sunset, filtering through
[5:31] the chinks between the roughly squared
[5:33] logs. Pencil beams of light move slowly
[5:36] across the table. A homemade affair
[5:39] built from a sawed off tree stump with
[5:41] wooden pegs for legs and a bench for a
[5:44] seat. The only other piece of furniture
[5:46] in the single 12-t long room was a
[5:48] primitive bed nailed to one wall. Ellis
[5:51] staggered to the bed and collapsed on
[5:53] its straw tick, pulling the quilt up to
[5:56] her chin. The cornchuck pillow crackled
[5:58] under her head with every move. As the
[6:01] room darkened to black, Ella thought
[6:03] about her former home in Paris, Texas,
[6:06] which she had so recently wanted to
[6:08] escape. Last year it had seemed
[6:10] intolerable, but now from this position
[6:13] it did not seem so bad. She had grown up
[6:16] in Texas as Ella Harvey. Her father was
[6:19] a hunter, trapper, and school teacher.
[6:22] Her mother was a full-blooded Cherokee
[6:24] Indian. Ella, the oldest of four
[6:26] children, had lived a wonderful,
[6:27] carefree childhood until three years ago
[6:30] when her mother died from scarlet fever.
[6:33] At that time, Ella was barely 12 years
[6:35] old, and her youngest brother was only
[6:38] four. The chore of mothering fell
[6:40] heavily into Ella's lap. A little over a
[6:43] year ago, she'd met Charles Brham at a
[6:45] rodeo. Charles was short and handsome
[6:47] with curly black hair, broad shoulders,
[6:50] and enough cowboy skills to defeat
[6:52] almost every bucking bronco that he
[6:54] challenged. Ella was smitten by his
[6:57] charm. Charles was 18 and she was 14.
[7:00] But she
[7:13] felt stronger, more commanding than
[7:15] before. Ella felt her panic rise with a
[7:18] spreading discomfort. She held her
[7:20] swollen stomach and groaned, "Not yet.
[7:24] Please, not yet. Not until Charles comes
[7:27] home. Beads of sweat popped out in her
[7:30] forehead. She staggered across the dirt
[7:32] floor to the cabin's only window, set in
[7:35] the middle of a crude wooden door. The
[7:38] window had no glass, only a wooden
[7:40] shutter which Ella left open during the
[7:42] day and closed at night. Now it was
[7:46] open. "Charles!" she screamed. Her voice
[7:49] seemed to evaporate into the Kentucky
[7:51] back woods with his vast expanse of
[7:54] hills and hollows stretching out from
[7:56] her in every direction. Knowing her
[7:58] nearest neighbor lived miles away made
[8:01] Ella feel desperately alone. The pain
[8:03] tightened around her stomach, driving
[8:05] her into a panic. Charles, she screamed
[8:09] again. Charles, where are you? Then her
[8:12] voice sank into a feeble sob. Please
[8:15] come home. I need you.
[8:18] Charles Brandham had received his
[8:20] logging pay that morning and had walked
[8:22] into Burksville, Kentucky to buy a new

[8:51] maples and oaks that had just begun to
[8:53] bud. It was April in the year 1909. Ella
[8:58] shivered as she closed the
[9:00] shutter. Now the only light in the cabin
[9:03] came from the sunset filtering through
[9:05] the chinks between the roughly squared
[9:07] logs. Pencil beams of light move slowly
[9:10] across the table. a homemade affair
[9:13] built from a sawed off tree stump with
[9:15] wooden pegs for legs and a bench for a

[9:20] in the single 12-oot long room was a

[9:39] which she had so recently wanted to

[9:44] intolerable. But now, from this
[9:46] position, it did not seem so bad. She
[9:50] had grown up in Texas as Ella Harvey.
[9:52] Her father was a hunter, trapper, and
[9:54] school teacher. Her mother was a
[9:56] full-blooded Cherokee Indian. Ella, the
[9:59] oldest of four children, had lived a
[10:01] wonderful, carefree childhood until
[10:03] three years ago when her mother died
[10:05] from scarlet fever. At that time, Ella
[10:08] was barely 12 years old, and her
[10:10] youngest brother was only four. The
[10:12] chore of mothering fell heavily into
[10:14] Ella's lap. A little over a year ago,
[10:17] she'd met Charles Brham at a rodeo.
[10:20] Charles was short and handsome with
[10:21] curly black hair, broad shoulders, and
[10:24] enough cowboy skills to defeat almost
[10:26] every bucking bronco that he challenged.
[10:29] Ella was smitten by his charm. Charles
[10:32] was 18 and she was 14, but she felt
[10:35] years older. At that time, marriage had
[10:38] seemed like a good way to avoid the
[10:40] drudgery of caring for her younger
[10:42] siblings. Now she wondered if she had
[10:44] merely jumped from one hot frying pan
[10:46] into another. Here she was, 15 years
[10:49] old, a stranger in the Kentucky hills,
[10:52] having a baby 40 miles from the nearest
[10:54] doctor with not even a friend to call on
[10:57] for help. Burying her head in her
[10:59] pillow, Ella
[11:01] wept. Charles Brandon returned to the
[11:04] cabin an hour after dark. He had been
[11:06] drinking, of course, but not enough to
[11:08] dull his thinking. He inched the door
[11:10] open quietly so that he wouldn't disturb
[11:13] his young wife if she were asleep. Then
[11:15] he heard her moan. Charles quickly lit a
[11:18] pine knot and set it on the lid of a
[11:20] fruit jar. The pine knot burned with a
[11:22] dim sputtering light that gave off
[11:24] volumes of smoke. Because the cabin was
[11:27] naturally ventilated, the smoke drifted
[11:30] up past the rafters, sifting out through
[11:32] the cracks in the clapboard shingles
[11:34] overhead. "Charles," Ella whispered
[11:37] weakly. "Tonight's the night. Go fetch
[11:40] your mama." Charles built a fire. Then
[11:43] he hurried to his mother's cabin. The
[11:45] night was cold and clear, and the
[11:47] starlight made it easy to keep on the
[11:48] path. An hour later, he returned with
[11:51] his mother and two neighbor women.
[11:54] Grandma Brham was a crusty old woman,
[11:56] tough as bacon rind. But seeing this
[11:59] little 15year-old girl in labor softened
[12:01] her like hot grease softens boot
[12:04] leather. Not that Grandma Brandom ever
[12:06] used boots herself. She'd never owned a
[12:08] pair of shoes in her life. Now she took
[12:11] charge of the situation. Having had 17
[12:14] children of her own, she was
[12:15] wellprepared to act as midwife for her
[12:18] new daughter-in-law. She insisted that
[12:20] Charles wait outside. He did not
[12:23] argue. Taking a blanket, he crawled
[12:26] under the leanto, tacked onto one end of
[12:28] the cabin, making his bed in the wood
[12:30] chips and bark. Pulling a flask of
[12:33] whiskey out of his pocket, Charles
[12:35] polished it off to calm his nerves.
[12:37] Before long, he fell sound asleep. As
[12:40] dawn approached, the commotion inside
[12:42] the cabin grew more intense. Charles
[12:45] roused. The eastern horizon was turning
[12:48] lighter with the approach of dawn, but
[12:50] the sun had not yet risen. He cursed
[12:52] himself for having dozed, and then
[12:54] started to worry because his baby had
[12:56] not yet been born. Was something wrong?
[12:59] Maybe he should go inside and check.
[13:01] Before he could make up his mind, he
[13:03] heard the high-pitched squall of a
[13:05] newborn. The cabin door flew open and
[13:08] one of the neighbor women called Charles
[13:10] Brham. It's a boy. Sheepishly Charles
[13:14] shuffled inside and closed the door. The
[13:16] room smelled of smoke from a greased
[13:18] candle on the table. Grandma Brham
[13:21] finished washing the infant, weighed him
[13:23] at 5bs, then gently laid him in his
[13:26] mother's arms. Charles stood near the
[13:28] bed with his hands tucked into the bib
[13:30] of his new overalls, nervously watching
[13:32] this wiggling, grunting little creature
[13:34] that was his son. Ella said, "Charles,
[13:38] he's got your blue eyes." "Charles
[13:41] studied the small eyes, but in the dim
[13:43] light, he couldn't tell their color."
[13:45] "We'll call his first name William," he
[13:47] said. "And his middle name will be
[13:49] Marion." Ella tested the name with her
[13:52] tongue. William Marryiam Brham. It
[13:55] sounded distinguished enough, and he can
[13:57] go by the name of Billy. Charles, I
[14:00] think Billy's going to have your curly
[14:02] hair, too. Open the shutter so I can see
[14:04] him better. It was shortly after 5:00
[14:07] Tuesday morning, April 6th, 1909.
[14:10] Daylight filtered in through the chinks,
[14:13] even though the sun had not yet topped
[14:15] the horizon. Charles opened the shutter,
[14:17] then drew back, startled. Something had
[14:20] darted through the open window. a light
[14:23] like a star about a foot in diameter.
[14:26] Ellis screamed and cradled her son
[14:28] tightly to her bosom. The others
[14:31] bewildered, stepped back against the
[14:33] wall. The strange light circled the room
[14:35] several times, then stopped over the
[14:37] bed, hovering above the new mother and
[14:40] the child, glowing yellowish green,
[14:43] pulsating with a life of its own. For
[14:46] less than a minute, it held that
[14:47] position. Not long, yet long enough for
[14:51] everyone in the cabin to be sure they
[14:53] had really seen it. Then, as quickly as
[14:55] it had come in, the fireball left,
[14:58] whirling up past the rafters and out
[15:00] through the roof. Charles stared up at
[15:03] the clapboard shingles with wide,
[15:05] unblinking eyes. Suddenly, a flurry of
[15:08] wings turned his attention towards the
[15:10] door, where a dove had landed on the
[15:12] sill of the open window. The snow white
[15:15] dove eyed the room with curiosity,
[15:18] almost as if looking for something. When
[15:20] it spotted the newborn baby, it cocked
[15:22] its head and cooed before it flew away.
[15:26] Charles gazed after the bird for a
[15:28] moment, then rolled his eyes back up
[15:30] towards the roof. One of the neighbor
[15:32] women muttered, "Well, I never." The
[15:35] other mused, "I wonder what kind of
[15:37] young this boy will be." Billy Brham was
[15:41] only 15 minutes old. News spread quickly
[15:44] among the mountain folk about that young
[15:46] andborn yonder on the hill with a light
[15:48] over him. Some passed it off as sunlight
[15:51] reflecting from a mirror. Ella and
[15:53] Charles knew better since there were no
[15:55] mirrors in their cabin. Besides, the sun
[15:58] had not yet come up. They were puzzled.
[16:01] Was there some spiritual meaning in the
[16:03] light? Charles wanted to forget it, but
[16:05] Ella wouldn't let him. She insisted that
[16:08] something must be done and finally
[16:10] decided that their baby should be taken
[16:12] to a church and dedicated to God. At
[16:15] first, Charles argued against this idea,
[16:17] but finally he consented, although the
[16:20] concession rad against the grain of his
[16:22] character. Now, the question came up,
[16:24] where should they take him? The ancestry
[16:27] of Charles Brandon was strictly Irish
[16:29] Catholic. On Ella's side, the Harveys
[16:32] were Irish Catholic, too, except for
[16:34] Ella's mother, who belonged to the
[16:35] Cherokee nation. However, both Charles
[16:38] and Ella had drifted completely away
[16:40] from their Catholic foundation, and
[16:42] neither of them had any formal religious
[16:44] convictions. They agreed that for their
[16:46] purpose, the best church was the nearest
[16:49] church. So when Billy Brandham was two
[16:51] weeks old, Charles and Ella bundled him
[16:53] up and took him down to the Apossum
[16:55] Kingdom Baptist Church where a small
[16:57] congregation met each Sunday in a rustic
[17:00] log building with a dirt floor and pews
[17:03] made from boards lying across upturned
[17:05] blocks of wood. The Apossum Kingdom
[17:07] Baptist Church had no regular pastor. On
[17:10] most Sundays, the congregation sang
[17:12] songs and read from the Bible. But every
[17:15] two months, a circuit preacher came
[17:17] through and delivered a sermon. The old
[17:19] preacher was there today. He offered
[17:21] prayer over little William Mariam Brham,
[17:24] asking God to someday use this boy in
[17:26] his service. It was the last time Billy
[17:29] Brham would enter a church building for
[17:31] 23
[17:32] years. Logging often forced Charles to
[17:35] be away from his wife and son during the
[17:37] week. That October in 1909, a blizzard
[17:41] stranded him in a lumber camp far from
[17:43] home. Ella, four months pregnant with
[17:45] their second child, worried as her
[17:47] supplies dwindled. When her firewood ran
[17:50] out, she wrapped her feet in burlap bags
[17:52] and struggled through the waist high
[17:54] drifts and biting wind, fighting her way
[17:57] into the woods to chop down saplings and
[17:59] dead branches, dragging them back into
[18:01] the cabin in a desperate attempt to keep
[18:03] her fire going. But when her food gave
[18:06] out, she despared. The fire cooled to
[18:09] ashes. Ella was too weak to make another
[18:12] trip outside for wood. Gathering every
[18:14] scrap of clothing in the cabin, she
[18:16] wrapped herself and her son as best she
[18:19] could, crawled into bed, and pulled the
[18:21] quilt over them. Outside the wind howled
[18:24] unceasingly. The room chilled until her
[18:27] water bucket froze. Ella stared up into
[18:30] the rafters and considered again that
[18:32] strange light at her son's birth. She
[18:35] had thought of it often over the past
[18:36] six months. Sometimes she believed it
[18:39] was a sign that Billy was destined for
[18:41] greatness. Now it seemed meaningless
[18:44] since death for both of them could not
[18:46] be far away. Her nearest neighbor was an
[18:48] old man who lived across the valley.
[18:51] When the storm blew out, this neighbor
[18:53] stepped outside to do some chores. He
[18:56] could just see the top of the Brham
[18:58] cabin, and he noticed there was no smoke
[19:00] rising from the chimney. At the time he
[19:02] didn't give it much thought, but after
[19:04] several days he grew concerned. He knew
[19:06] smoke had been coming from the cabin
[19:08] before the storm and no one could have
[19:10] left the cabin during the storm.
[19:12] Figuring something might be wrong, he
[19:14] decided to investigate. As he approached
[19:17] the cabin, he saw there were no tracks
[19:19] in the newfallen snow. That confirmed
[19:21] his fear that no one had left the cabin
[19:23] after the storm ended. He knocked but
[19:26] got no reply. When he tried the door, he
[19:28] found it was locked from the inside. Now
[19:31] he knew someone was in there, someone
[19:33] who must be in serious trouble, or they
[19:35] would have answered him. With a great
[19:38] effort, he managed to force open the
[19:40] door. What he found inside made him
[19:43] shudder. Ella and her baby were huddled
[19:45] on the bed, almost dead from cold and
[19:48] starvation. Hurriedly, the neighbor
[19:50] grabbed Ella's ax and went into the
[19:52] woods, bringing back enough fuel to warm
[19:54] the cabin. Finding no food, he trudged
[19:57] home and returned with as many groceries
[19:59] as he could carry. Calling a doctor was
[20:01] out of the question, so the old man took
[20:04] care of the young mother and child
[20:05] himself. By the time Charles broke
[20:08] through the drifts to his cabin, his
[20:09] wife and son were starting to recover
[20:11] their strength. The rest of that winter,
[20:14] Charles stayed close to home, hunting
[20:16] and trapping to keep the larder filled.
[20:18] In the spring, he went back to logging.
[20:21] After the ice thaw, he would hitch up an
[20:23] ox to the logs and one by one drag them
[20:26] down to the Cumberland River, where
[20:28] other loggers would lash them together
[20:30] into a raft, float them down to the Ohio
[20:33] River, and then onto the
[20:35] Mississippi. In March of 1910, Charles
[20:38] and Ella had their second child, Edward.
[20:41] A few months later, Ella, now 16, felt
[20:44] another baby growing in her womb. She
[20:46] bore her third child early in 1911. It
[20:49] was another boy. She named him Henry.
[20:52] Charles logged through the spring and
[20:54] summer into the fall of 1911. Then
[20:57] misfortune struck again, ripping Charles
[21:00] from his young family and almost
[21:02] destroying him. As the youngest of 17
[21:05] children, Charles Brham had grown up
[21:07] with many rough teachers. He learned to
[21:10] hold his whiskey when he was just a boy,
[21:12] and he learned to settle disputes with
[21:14] his fists. In the fall of 1911, Charles
[21:17] was at a party when a fight broke out.
[21:19] Moonshine and hardened men made a wicked
[21:22] mix, and soon the fight grew into a
[21:24] ferocious brawl involving everyone in
[21:27] the room. One powerful bully named
[21:29] Willie Yarborl knocked a friend of
[21:31] Charles to the floor, jumped on him, and
[21:33] drew his knife and was about to plunge
[21:35] it into his heart when Charles brought a
[21:38] chair down on Willy's head. Charles
[21:40] backed away and drew his own blade.
[21:43] Willie forgot the man on the floor and
[21:45] went after Charles. Willie would have
[21:47] slit Charles's throat if he had gotten
[21:50] the chance. He was a merciless man who
[21:52] had killed his own son with a fence
[21:54] rail. But Charles knife found its mark
[21:57] first, leaving Willie in a pool of
[21:59] blood, senseless, though still alive.
[22:02] News of this brawl reached Burksville,
[22:04] Kentucky. Charles was implicated as a
[22:06] ring leader and charged with attempted
[22:08] murder. A sheriff rode up on horseback
[22:11] to arrest him. Before the sheriff could
[22:14] find him, Charles caught wind of his
[22:16] danger. He had to leave in a hurry, not
[22:18] knowing where he would go or what he
[22:20] would do. Before he left, he promised
[22:23] Ella that as soon as he found work and a
[22:25] place for them to live, he would send
[22:27] for her using an assumed name so he
[22:29] could not be traced. And so in the space
[22:32] of an afternoon, Charles Brham vanished,
[22:35] leaving his wife alone in the woods to
[22:37] fend for herself and their three babies.
[22:40] Billy was 2 and a half, Edward was 1 and
[22:42] a half, and Henry was barely 6 months
[22:45] old. At 17, Ella was almost a child
[22:49] herself. Before a few weeks had passed,
[22:52] she realized Charles had left a part of
[22:54] himself with her. She was pregnant
[22:56] again. That fall and winter stretched
[22:59] Ella to the limit of her strength. She
[23:01] seemed to be living through a nightmare,
[23:03] trying to care for three babies in a
[23:05] rude, isolated cabin, while she herself
[23:08] felt nauseated much of the time. She had
[23:11] no money, no resources, and no energy.
[23:14] If it had not been for the help of
[23:16] Charles relatives, poor as they were,
[23:19] Ella knew she would not have survived.
[23:21] But finally, the seasons changed, the
[23:24] ground thawed, and her nausea ended.
[23:26] Henry passed his first birthday, Edward
[23:29] his second, and Billy his third. The
[23:31] baby kicking and twisting in Ella's womb
[23:33] was getting near delivery. Once during
[23:36] that spring of 1912, a sheriff stopped
[23:38] by the cabin to ask if Ella had heard
[23:40] from her husband. She could tell the
[23:42] truth. She had not heard from him and
[23:44] had no idea where he was. A few days
[23:48] after the sheriff's visit, Billy and
[23:50] Edward were playing outside the cabin
[23:52] where a small spring kept the ground
[23:54] muddy. Billy wanted to show his younger
[23:56] brother how strong he was. So, he picked
[23:58] up the biggest rock he could lift, held
[24:01] it over his head, and threw it towards
[24:03] the spring. The rock sank deep into the
[24:05] muck by the water's edge, splattering
[24:07] mud all over Edward, who promptly cried
[24:10] and waddled back to the cabin. A robin
[24:13] began to chirp with gusto. Billy
[24:16] searched the branches until he spied the
[24:18] bird in a nearby tree. He took one step
[24:21] toward it, and the robin flew away. At
[24:24] that moment, something so startling
[24:26] happened that it would brand itself to
[24:28] his tender mind. It become his first
[24:30] significant childhood
[24:32] memory. From where the robin had been
[24:34] perched, there came a sound like wind
[24:36] rustling the
[24:38] leaves. Then a voice boomed from the
[24:41] tree, a very clear human voice, which
[24:44] said, "You will live near a city called
[24:47] New Albany." With a shriek of terror,
[24:50] Billy took off for the cabin as fast as
[24:52] his stubby legs could take him,
[24:54] squealing. "Mama,
[24:56] mama!" Ella was wiping mud from Edward's
[24:59] tummy. "Billy, what happened?" she asked
[25:01] as she hugged her oldest son to her
[25:03] side. A bird talked to me, "Mama, I
[25:06] heard him singing in the tree. Then he
[25:08] talked to me." Ella laughed. "You were
[25:10] dreaming, child." But Billy insisted, "I
[25:13] heard him, Mama. I heard him talk." "And
[25:16] what did the bird say?" Hey, Ellise,
[25:18] still thinking it was Billy's
[25:20] imagination. He said we would live near
[25:22] a city called New Albany. This reply
[25:26] startled her. It did not seem like
[25:28] something a small boy would make up in
[25:30] his play. She stepped around behind the
[25:33] cabin and called into the woods, "Hello,
[25:36] anybody there?" When she came back
[25:38] inside, Billy asked, "Mama, where is New
[25:41] Albany?" It's a town in Indiana, just
[25:44] across the river from Louisville,
[25:45] Kentucky, about a 100 miles from here.
[25:48] Billy, where did you hear talk of New
[25:50] Albany? I ain't never heard of New
[25:52] Albany, Mama, until that bird talked to
[25:55] me. Mama, when are we going to live
[25:57] there? Will Papa live there with us?
[26:00] Ella shook her head. Several weeks
[26:02] later, a long awaited letter from
[26:04] Charles arrived. Ella sat at the stump
[26:07] table, staring at the envelope she held
[26:09] between her trembling fingers. Billy
[26:11] stood in his tiptoes, peeking over the
[26:14] tabletop. Open it, mama. Ella giggled
[26:17] nervously. Of course, we've waited a
[26:20] long time for this. Why wait any longer?
[26:23] Carefully, she undid the glued flap,
[26:25] removed the letter from its envelope,
[26:27] opened it, and began to read. Since her
[26:30] father was a school teacher, she had
[26:32] received a fair education. But Charles
[26:34] had almost no schooling, and could
[26:36] neither read nor write, not even his own
[26:39] name. One of his brothers living in
[26:41] Louisville had written this letter for
[26:43] him. "What does it say, Mama?" Billy
[26:46] asked. She talked as she read. "It says
[26:49] that your papa is in Indiana. He's found
[26:51] steady work and a place for us to live,
[26:53] and he wants us to come right away. It's
[26:56] in a little town called Udica, about 10
[26:58] miles northeast of." She stopped
[27:01] abruptly and looked with amazement at
[27:03] her three-year-old son. "How could it
[27:06] be?" "Where, mama? Where is Utica?"
[27:08] Billy persisted. Ella said slowly,
[27:10] "Billy, we're going to live 10 miles
[27:13] northeast of New Albany,
[27:18] Indiana." Pairs of eyes watched
[27:20] anxiously as Papa divided. four sticks
[27:23] of candy equally between his five boys.
