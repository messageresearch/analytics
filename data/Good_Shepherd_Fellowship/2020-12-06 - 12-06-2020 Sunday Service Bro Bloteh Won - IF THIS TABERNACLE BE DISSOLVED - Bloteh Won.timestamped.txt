[56:48] from illinois
[56:51] sister carol
[56:55] older sister hussman went to be with the

[57:08] she's
[57:09] experiencing a little bit of pain on her
[57:11] back neck
[57:12] her neck or so so she asked that
[57:16] we remember her in our prayer but her
[57:19] brother-in-law
[57:21] over there in south dakota he was a
[57:24] minister a preacher
[57:29] and i think
[57:34] there was something that kind of
[57:35] occurred me now you know when i was
[57:38] talking with brother wesley and he was
[57:40] just
[57:40] you know telling me some of the last
[57:42] moment that he had
[57:44] he was down in his health and on hospice
[57:48] and his wife was taking care of him and
[57:51] and all of that
[57:53] but uh just before he uh
[57:58] slipped out of this world you know being
[58:00] on auspice and everything that is
[58:02] happening to him
[58:03] [Music]
[58:06] he said out to them and uh he said
[58:10] like brother wesley said to me he asked
[58:12] them to bring him melada
[58:15] because he's seeing all his people over
[58:18] there
[58:19] and he want to claim up and go and meet
[58:20] them
[58:23] and then right after that there was
[58:26] such a kind of a sweet atmosphere that
[58:29] came through the room
[58:32] and he went out with that praise the
[58:35] lord
[58:38] amen i think that's that's a beautiful
[58:42] beautiful thing and and for many years
[58:44] to being down there in south dakota
[58:47] and i mean he was preaching to a little
[58:51] group there and his family at home
[58:53] but uh staying faithful to the word of
[58:55] god praise the lord sometimes we try to
[58:59] judge faithfulness by the crowd that we
[59:01] have
[59:02] you know faithfulness by you know the
[59:04] preacher that we have or the people that
[59:06] we are associated with
[59:08] but it's it's god that george is
[59:10] faithfulness because he's the faithful
[59:12] one
[59:13] amen he's the one that uh that uh
[59:18] you know the local us to be faithful
[59:20] because he's the faithful one
[59:22] he counted us worth it because he is the
[59:24] word of one amen
[59:26] and he is the one lord that await our
[59:28] righteousness because he is the
[59:30] righteous one so we just pray that the
[59:33] lord will be able to
[59:34] to comfort them and strengthen the
[59:37] family
[59:38] as as the moon the lost
[59:41] and many families that are mourning they
[59:43] are lost in such a difficult time
[59:46] praise the lord amen

[59:52] the book of lamentation we've been
[59:55] reading book lamentation at home
[59:57] and i just i was just carried away by
[1:00:00] uh you know what was happening there
[1:00:03] with the prophet
[1:00:04] jeremiah seeing israel going into
[1:00:08] captivity

[1:00:16] the people that was one look at as the
[1:00:18] princess
[1:00:19] of the earth was now being ravaged
[1:00:22] you know when jeremiah talks about the
[1:00:24] children begging for bread in the street
[1:00:26] you know in my mind just couldn't get
[1:00:29] off of that
[1:00:29] seeing most of the food depots
[1:00:33] around the united states and cars lining
[1:00:36] up for food
[1:00:37] and seeing the homelessness that is
[1:00:39] coming to this great nation that once
[1:00:41] stood
[1:00:42] up in the world and every nation around
[1:00:45] the world
[1:00:46] look at america and to look in the news
[1:00:49] and see
[1:00:49] people lining up with with cars you know
[1:00:52] for food
[1:00:54] food airports and and it's not only
[1:00:56] shown
[1:00:57] in in america they're shown around the
[1:00:59] world you know when
[1:01:00] and uh uh it shows that uh you know
[1:01:04] god's word
[1:01:06] never failed amen heaven and earth will
[1:01:08] pass away
[1:01:10] but this word of god will never pass
[1:01:12] away
[1:01:13] praise the lord that's that's our anchor
[1:01:16] that's that's our trust that's the thing
[1:01:18] that we live for
[1:01:20] amen is the word of god praise the lord
[1:01:23] i just just been
[1:01:24] consumed by that but the most thing
[1:01:26] about it did is the other
[1:01:28] that that was that was just that was
[1:01:29] hitting me in warsaw
[1:01:31] year is all of these things happening in
[1:01:34] the land
[1:01:35] but here is a man a prophet of god
[1:01:39] that just sit back and when he look at
[1:01:41] the things happening
[1:01:42] the only thing he can do is to just weep
[1:01:46] and we have we have people just being
[1:01:50] unconcerned you know i mean everybody is
[1:01:53] just caring for themselves as long as
[1:01:55] nothing is happening to me i'm healthy
[1:01:57] and fine you know i get a job
[1:01:59] i've not lost my job yet and and we just
[1:02:01] think the whole world
[1:02:03] is just in our living room
[1:02:07] just to be able to step out a little bit
[1:02:10] and think about
[1:02:12] what are people
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:15] in somalia going through what are people
[1:02:18] in yummy going through
[1:02:23] hungry children
[1:02:27] [Music]
[1:02:30] if you have a thought like that and you
[1:02:33] buy your head
[1:02:34] to eat your meal
[1:02:37] to think that somebody have not got a
[1:02:40] meal to eat
[1:02:48] the whole book of jeremiah of
[1:02:50] lamentation
[1:02:52] was written from a weeping prophet
[1:02:56] a man that was just weeping he just
[1:03:00] looked at little children innocent
[1:03:02] what have they done to be weary max
[1:03:06] [Music]
[1:03:11] kind of for being taught but they tore
[1:03:12] up with their and sometimes it's hard to
[1:03:15] get out of there to be able to do
[1:03:16] anything or look at anything
[1:03:19] and uh but i'm not preaching on
[1:03:21] lamentation this morning i'll try natto
[1:03:24] i mean
[1:03:25] but that's where my spirit is that's
[1:03:26] where my heart is
[1:03:28] that's where my heart is when the world
[1:03:32] become vulnerable like this
[1:03:34] then there are people that there that
[1:03:37] take the advantage of other people and
[1:03:39] abuse them
[1:03:40] in different ways
[1:03:46] but i pray that the lord will just be
[1:03:48] able to help us
[1:03:50] this morning and give us grace

[1:05:43] praise the lord second corinthian
[1:05:44] chapter five
[1:05:46] second corinthians chapter five
[1:05:51] we will review versus the ending and
[1:05:54] then
[1:05:55] we will go into our subject this morning
[1:05:58] i pray the lord will be able to give us
[1:06:00] grace amen
[1:06:10] ii corinthians chapter five
[1:06:15] for we know that if our earthly house
[1:06:19] of this tabernacle be dissolved
[1:06:22] we have a building we have a building of
[1:06:26] god and house not made with hands
[1:06:30] in tanner in the heavens
[1:06:39] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[1:06:42] to be
[1:06:43] clothed upon with our house
[1:06:47] which is from heaven
[1:06:51] if so be that being clothed
[1:06:54] we shall not be found naked
[1:06:59] for we that are in this tabernacle do
[1:07:01] grown
[1:07:02] being burdened not for that
[1:07:06] we will be on clothes but clothed upon
[1:07:12] that mortality might be swallow up
[1:07:16] of life praise the lord
[1:07:20] now he that have rough us
[1:07:23] for this same thing is god
[1:07:26] who also have given unto
[1:07:30] us the earnest of the spirit
[1:07:37] wherefore we are always confident nor in
[1:07:40] death whereas we
[1:07:42] are at home in the body we
[1:07:46] are absent from the lord praise the lord
[1:07:49] the lord bless you you may have your
[1:07:51] seed
[1:07:52] we just want to take a little subject on
[1:07:54] this uh
[1:07:55] i don't know whether it's a little
[1:07:57] longer but uh
[1:07:58] there's a few things i want for us to
[1:08:00] cover if this
[1:08:03] tabernacle if this every tabernacle be
[1:08:05] dissolved
[1:08:06] amen if this every tabernacle be
[1:08:09] dissolved
[1:08:16] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:08:19] i actually had on my my mind my heart to
[1:08:22] to speak on the message the end of all
[1:08:24] flesh
[1:08:26] so i was standing on on flesh
[1:08:30] and uh because noah is the one that said
[1:08:33] that in the days of noah
[1:08:35] god said to noah the end of all flesh
[1:08:38] has come
[1:08:39] so i was looking at that and then i get
[1:08:42] to
[1:08:42] looking at the different kind of a flesh
[1:08:45] that we have
[1:08:46] so that's what we will be looking at
[1:08:47] this morning and then if the lord gave
[1:08:49] us grace we'll look at
[1:08:51] that thought of the the end of all flesh
[1:08:53] has come
[1:08:54] praise the lord but what i was going to
[1:08:57] go with that taught
[1:08:58] is that
[1:09:01] just like the apostle paul says here if
[1:09:04] this
[1:09:05] earthly tabernacle be dissolved and and
[1:09:08] uh uh not many people uh
[1:09:11] you know are thinking on the preparation
[1:09:14] of leaving this body if i leave this
[1:09:16] border what am i going to wear
[1:09:17] what where am i going to you know what
[1:09:20] is going to we
[1:09:21] we all our preparation and investment
[1:09:24] and everything that we are making
[1:09:25] most of them is for this earthly life
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:29] praise the lord and
[1:09:32] jesus said let not your heart be
[1:09:34] troubled believe in god and believe also
[1:09:36] remain i go and prepare the place for
[1:09:38] you in my father's house
[1:09:40] uh many mansion and then paul said if
[1:09:43] this
[1:09:43] house amen if this house
[1:09:48] of this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:09:52] and jesus says in my father's house i
[1:09:55] mean imagine i go and prepare the place
[1:09:57] for you
[1:09:58] so uh uh that's that's a little bit of
[1:10:00] there that we want to look at this
[1:10:02] morning
[1:10:03] and trusting that the law will be able
[1:10:05] to help us out
[1:10:06] speaking on wednesday night i i pretty
[1:10:09] much a little bit
[1:10:10] dashed into talking about feel of that
[1:10:14] and i was not able to back myself up
[1:10:16] because i that was not what i was
[1:10:17] talking about
[1:10:18] so uh i just i just thought i said well
[1:10:21] okay
[1:10:22] let's let's look at that a little bit
[1:10:24] maybe the grace of god would be able to
[1:10:25] help us but let's go to genesis chapter
[1:10:27] one
[1:10:28] genesis chapter 1 we look at the
[1:10:30] creation of man
[1:10:32] praise the lord genesis chapter 1 verse
[1:10:35] 26
[1:10:37] let's look at that and and be able to
[1:10:39] build our case here because
[1:10:41] there's a beautiful picture that is
[1:10:43] written there in genesis chapter one
[1:10:45] and god said let us make man
[1:10:49] in our image i want for us to look at
[1:10:52] this a little bit
[1:10:53] because uh uh a great uh
[1:10:56] uh dieter teaching and godhead's
[1:10:59] teaching has been
[1:11:01] i mean has been driven from the
[1:11:03] scripture the teaching of the trinity
[1:11:05] and all of that has come right from the
[1:11:07] scripture god said let
[1:11:08] us make man in our image but look at
[1:11:12] that word
[1:11:13] image if uh
[1:11:16] if it is if if the us represent
[1:11:21] more than one the image supposed to be
[1:11:24] images
[1:11:29] if the us represent more than one
[1:11:32] personality
[1:11:37] oh am i wrong is it it's
[1:11:41] i'm am i wrong i'm not looking at it
[1:11:43] wrong maybe it is me
[1:11:46] praise the lord but i i just
[1:11:49] it just caught my attention and i
[1:11:52] thought that
[1:11:53] i think it it's worth looking at again
[1:11:56] and god said let us make man in our
[1:12:00] image and in our
[1:12:03] likeness not images not
[1:12:06] likenesses
[1:12:09] but one image and one likeness
[1:12:13] because there is one god
[1:12:18] praise the lord are we together
[1:12:23] and let them let's make men
[1:12:28] but let them
[1:12:32] supposed to be like him
[1:12:37] praise the lord he says let
[1:12:40] us and let them
[1:12:45] praise the lord well maybe there
[1:12:48] maybe the translator of the bibles
[1:12:50] needed to check on their english
[1:12:52] but i believe god ordained it that way
[1:12:55] because
[1:12:56] there's a mystery that is hearing right
[1:12:58] in the pages of the book
[1:13:00] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:13:03] of the seed and over the files of the
[1:13:04] earth and over the cattles
[1:13:06] and over all the earth and over every
[1:13:09] creeping thing that creeped
[1:13:11] upon the earth verse 27
[1:13:14] so god created man in
[1:13:18] his image again
[1:13:21] in the image of god created
[1:13:25] he male and female so that's the damn
[1:13:28] that he was referring to
[1:13:31] one man but in that man it's a male
[1:13:35] and a female praise the lord
[1:13:39] and in the image of god created he him
[1:13:42] male and female
[1:13:44] created he them praise the lord
[1:13:48] and i read the scripture this morning to
[1:13:51] to to to start the conversation and tell
[1:13:54] you
[1:13:55] it was when god made that declaration
[1:13:58] that's what makes the devil hate you
[1:14:04] when god make that declaration that let
[1:14:06] us make man
[1:14:09] in our image
[1:14:12] in our likeness it makes the devil
[1:14:15] hit your very appearance
[1:14:19] he hits your very appearance he hit he
[1:14:22] hit the very dead it was announced he
[1:14:25] was born if you have a he had it in his
[1:14:27] power
[1:14:27] he will sweep you right on that
[1:14:29] maternity bed and squeeze your breath
[1:14:31] out of your body
[1:14:33] the devil hit your every existing
[1:14:36] because there was no
[1:14:37] creature of god no creature of god that
[1:14:40] was ever made in the image of god
[1:14:45] format of father angels were made before
[1:14:48] man was made
[1:14:49] in this way because god was not god
[1:14:52] until there were angels to worship him
[1:14:54] so he made the angels to worship him and
[1:14:57] great lucifer and all of his hosts are
[1:14:59] there
[1:15:00] and he's the chief injured and he thinks
[1:15:02] he's in charge
[1:15:04] and out of the sudden god said let us
[1:15:06] make man
[1:15:08] in our image and our likeness he said
[1:15:12] what
[1:15:13] is there going to be somebody that's
[1:15:15] going to be more than me
[1:15:17] somebody that is going to be more closer
[1:15:19] to god than me
[1:15:26] i'm not trying to make you excited i'm
[1:15:28] trying to make you to realize
[1:15:31] why you have the trouble you have
[1:15:37] it's because the devil hit your very
[1:15:40] existence
[1:15:42] and if it was not the mercy of god you
[1:15:44] would not be sitting down here
[1:15:47] you have been six feet under the earth
[1:15:55] are we together whenever
[1:15:58] you read genesis 26 1 26 and 27
[1:16:02] forget about the doctrinal part you must
[1:16:05] ever remember
[1:16:06] that when god made that declaration
[1:16:09] that's where my life
[1:16:10] trouble begins
[1:16:15] praise the lord
[1:16:18] psalm chapter eight
[1:16:23] psalm chapter eight let's read verse one
[1:16:26] we're gonna do a little bit of two

[1:19:04] and all the things you have made what is
[1:19:06] man

[1:19:13] of him praise the lord
[1:19:16] paul in hebrew chapter 2 verse 5
[1:19:20] we can start reading hebrew chapter 2
[1:19:22] verse 5.
[1:19:25] for unto the angel have he not
[1:19:28] put in suggestion the word

[1:21:07] and you were made the same
[1:21:10] praise the lord amen
[1:21:14] you make him a little lower than the
[1:21:15] angels
[1:21:18] the angels have one body
[1:21:24] the man was made in a lower form
[1:21:29] lower body that we called we would see
[1:21:33] in the scripture paul call it the
[1:21:35] terrestrial body
[1:21:37] amen but yet he was crying with glory in
[1:21:40] honor and god has set him to the place
[1:21:45] to be able to dominate the earth
[1:21:49] have dominion amen
[1:21:52] verse 8.
[1:21:56] that i have put all things in suggestion
[1:21:58] under his feet
[1:22:00] for in death he put all
[1:22:04] in suggestion on him he left nothing
[1:22:08] that is not put under him
[1:22:11] but now we see not yet all things put on
[1:22:15] him praise the lord verse 9
[1:22:20] but we see jesus
[1:22:24] who was me a little lower
[1:22:28] than the angels praise the lord
[1:22:33] amen he was made a little lower than the
[1:22:36] angels
[1:22:38] to redeem you and myself
[1:22:42] praise the lord amen
[1:22:45] he was made a little lower than the
[1:22:47] angels to redeem
[1:22:49] you and myself
[1:22:53] praise the lord
[1:22:57] faithful abraham but bam says when god
[1:23:01] made the first man
[1:23:02] in the garden of eden did you notice he
[1:23:05] made him both male and female
[1:23:08] he was a man made in god's image a
[1:23:12] spirit
[1:23:12] he he uh he put him in flesh
[1:23:16] that is genesis chapter 2 verse 7
[1:23:20] genesis the next chapter after
[1:23:23] he already made him male and female and
[1:23:27] and there still was no man to tilt the
[1:23:30] sword
[1:23:30] so then he created a man out of the dust
[1:23:32] of the earth not
[1:23:34] in his image the first one was in his
[1:23:37] image genesis
[1:23:38] uh 1 26 2 7 is in the dust of the earth
[1:23:42] but then god came down little lower than
[1:23:45] the angels jesus
[1:23:47] god came down in a form of man
[1:23:50] by jesus christ to redeem man
[1:23:53] that fell from the image from the image
[1:23:56] of the earth
[1:23:58] and he was made in the image of the
[1:24:00] earth
[1:24:01] oh god can't you see what what
[1:24:05] gospel means what god
[1:24:08] when god became man so man
[1:24:12] became god we are sons and daughters of
[1:24:16] god
[1:24:16] so he was made jesus this jesus made a
[1:24:19] lower
[1:24:20] little lord than the angel is because
[1:24:22] god made man in his
[1:24:24] image and man fell from that image so
[1:24:26] god has to come
[1:24:27] in the image of man to redeem us back to
[1:24:31] the image of god amen
[1:24:33] that's the place that we are going
[1:24:36] are we together amen let's continue to
[1:24:39] read in hebrew there
[1:24:42] amen
[1:24:44] are we together praise the lord
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:55] verse nine but we see jesus who was made
[1:24:58] a little lower than the angels for the
[1:25:00] suffering
[1:25:02] of death crown with glory and honor
[1:25:05] dead but that he by the grace of god
[1:25:09] should taste
[1:25:10] death for every man
[1:25:14] for it became him of whom
[1:25:18] are all things and
[1:25:21] by whom are all things in bringing many
[1:25:24] sons unto glory
[1:25:26] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:25:28] perfect through
[1:25:30] suffering you can read the rest it will
[1:25:32] be a blessing to you
[1:25:34] so we see here that the the thought on
[1:25:37] our mind
[1:25:38] right down from genesis 1 that we read
[1:25:40] what is man
[1:25:42] what is man what what is man
[1:25:46] that they all are so mindful what is
[1:25:48] human
[1:25:49] let's say that way amen what are we
[1:25:52] humans
[1:25:56] what are we humans
[1:26:03] the only creatures that have a soul
[1:26:08] amen
[1:26:14] so as we look at this we realize that
[1:26:19] there were there were things god made
[1:26:21] man
[1:26:22] in his image and we know
[1:26:25] that that man was a spirit man he was
[1:26:29] not a flesh man
[1:26:31] the man of genesis chapter 126
[1:26:35] was a spirit man i would say
[1:26:38] in poor language because we will get
[1:26:40] there and you realize
[1:26:41] the man of genesis 1 26 was
[1:26:44] a celestial body
[1:26:48] amen now in genesis 2
[1:26:51] 7 that was where god made the
[1:26:53] terrestrial body
[1:26:57] so man man is having in him
[1:27:02] the the the the mystery
[1:27:06] of the different bodies that god
[1:27:10] uses if this
[1:27:14] athlete tabernacle be dissolved
[1:27:17] if this terrestrial body there is a
[1:27:20] cerestral body
[1:27:22] that's what genesis is showing us there
[1:27:25] was
[1:27:25] a cerestral body before a terrestrial
[1:27:30] body
[1:27:32] are we together this is not this
[1:27:35] is this is what what we what we have
[1:27:37] here what we see here
[1:27:38] what we are living through is not all
[1:27:40] about life
[1:27:44] there is a more glorious
[1:27:49] amen just like we said wednesday night
[1:27:52] to go
[1:27:52] without thinking of fear
[1:27:56] to go with not one more thought of
[1:27:58] thinking
[1:27:59] evil about anybody
[1:28:06] praise the lord amen
[1:28:09] when god made man in his image in that
[1:28:12] celestial body
[1:28:14] in the image of god the bible said he
[1:28:16] made man
[1:28:17] men could not fall in their body
[1:28:20] there was no sin in their body because
[1:28:23] there it was a perfect
[1:28:25] image of god
[1:28:32] praise the lord but when that body
[1:28:36] was placed in an ethnic body
[1:28:41] you see paul talking about the house of
[1:28:43] our affluent tabernacle be dissolved
[1:28:48] amen many times we think
[1:28:52] like uh you know we will we will get rid
[1:28:55] of this body it's almost like
[1:28:57] you want to just get out of it and kick
[1:28:59] it
[1:29:01] so you fold up so much pain it's not
[1:29:03] going to be like that
[1:29:04] it's going to be dissolved
[1:29:08] it's going to be dissolved oh my god
[1:29:10] just help us this morning amen
[1:29:14] i'm trying to tell you a little bit that
[1:29:15] you better be nice to your body
[1:29:18] give you some bath good haircut
[1:29:22] amen because it's going to be the same
[1:29:26] one you will well
[1:29:28] just out of brand new state amen
[1:29:30] [Laughter]
[1:29:34] praise the lord amen
[1:29:37] amen i don't want to get my life
[1:29:39] inspired on me
[1:29:42] but i'm trusting that the lord is going
[1:29:43] to help us this morning praise the lord
[1:29:46] we just have a uh a little more few
[1:29:48] things here
[1:29:50] to cover kids ketu spinel uh we want to
[1:29:53] read that here
[1:29:54] he says we have three different bodies
[1:29:58] with wording one is a human body
[1:30:02] the other is a celestial body the other
[1:30:06] is a glorified body
[1:30:12] we have three bodies
[1:30:15] that we do in first corinthians chapter
[1:30:18] 15 let's look there together
[1:30:27] first corinthians chapter 15. let's look
[1:30:30] there together
[1:30:37] if we don't get through this we'll make
[1:30:39] another time to get through it amen
[1:30:50] and let me just first start reading here
[1:30:52] from verse
[1:30:53] 15 i mean from verse one moreover
[1:30:56] brethren i declared unto you
[1:30:58] the gospel which i preached unto you
[1:31:01] which
[1:31:01] also you have received
[1:31:04] and were in years 10 by which
[1:31:07] also yeah i save if you keep
[1:31:11] in memory what i preach unto you
[1:31:15] unless ye have believed in vain
[1:31:19] praise the lord amen
[1:31:25] for i deliver unto you first of all
[1:31:29] that which i also received how that
[1:31:32] christ died for our sins according to
[1:31:35] the scripture
[1:31:37] and and that he was buried and that
[1:31:41] he rose again the 10-day i call into the
[1:31:44] scripture
[1:31:45] and and that he was seen
[1:31:49] or see first then
[1:31:52] of the twelve now that's something i'm
[1:31:56] i'm
[1:31:56] trying to get to you here um
[1:32:00] after that he was seen
[1:32:03] of about 500
[1:32:06] brethren at once now paul is
[1:32:09] is telling us a little bit here about
[1:32:12] after jesus
[1:32:14] jesus uh are resurrected
[1:32:17] amen he died for our sin and he was
[1:32:20] buried and he rose again but when he
[1:32:22] rose again now
[1:32:23] now you think about this now paul you're
[1:32:26] talking about
[1:32:27] he says
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:31] what i deliver unto you first all the
[1:32:33] things that's verse 3
[1:32:35] which i also receive and how that christ
[1:32:38] died for our sin now before he died he
[1:32:42] lived on this earth amen
[1:32:44] and and and he healed the sick he raised
[1:32:46] the dead and
[1:32:47] and and and and people saw him he was in
[1:32:51] one kind of a body he was born
[1:32:55] of a virgin amen
[1:32:58] he was in a terrestrial body he had a
[1:33:01] body
[1:33:02] word he could be hungry
[1:33:05] he had a body word he went to the grave
[1:33:08] of lazarus
[1:33:09] and he wept but he's saying here
[1:33:13] that when when jesus resurrected
[1:33:19] see if i saw him first stephen
[1:33:22] and then the twelve saw him and then
[1:33:25] after
[1:33:26] there were about 500 brethren that saw
[1:33:29] jesus when he resurrected
[1:33:32] amen praise the lord
[1:33:36] they saw him when he resurrected
[1:33:39] are we together now i want you to keep
[1:33:41] this picture in your mind because we're
[1:33:43] going to travel through the scriptures a
[1:33:44] little bit
[1:33:45] so you can see it see that but yara said
[1:33:48] when he resurrected
[1:33:51] he was not in a terrestrial body
[1:33:57] but yet these 500 brethren could see him
[1:34:02] are we together now as we travel here he
[1:34:06] says
[1:34:07] and a scene of 500 at once
[1:34:11] of whom the greater path remain
[1:34:15] unto this present but some has fallen
[1:34:19] asleep which means some of them are
[1:34:20] still alive
[1:34:21] after that he was seen of james
[1:34:27] then of
[1:34:30] all the apostles
[1:34:34] and last of all he was seen
[1:34:37] of me also praise the lord
[1:34:41] and paul also saw him but paul saw him
[1:34:45] in a different kind of a body
[1:34:52] so paul him i mean
[1:34:53] [Laughter]
[1:34:56] saw paul
[1:35:00] saw paul saw him amen
[1:35:04] paul saw him in a different kind of a
[1:35:06] body a different form
[1:35:08] paul never knew jesus after the flesh
[1:35:12] because he never met jesus in the flesh
[1:35:18] amen
[1:35:22] that's another subject because that's
[1:35:24] where we were going to speak on the end
[1:35:26] of all flesh
[1:35:27] because you got to go beyond the flesh
[1:35:29] to really know jesus
[1:35:30] in this day
[1:35:35] so he said at last you know i saw him
[1:35:40] at least of the apostles now so
[1:35:44] we we we see paul identify
[1:35:48] few things here some saw him when he was
[1:35:51] alive some saw him when he resurrected
[1:35:55] praise the lord are we together
[1:35:59] and uh
[1:36:03] i'm a little bit ahead of myself but
[1:36:04] that's okay

[1:39:14] his head and his feet the body was not
[1:39:16] there but they were in that position
[1:39:18] where the body was laid and uh
[1:39:21] [Music]

[1:39:30] they have they have taken away my lord
[1:39:33] and i know
[1:39:34] that way they have let him
[1:39:38] and when she had said she turned
[1:39:42] herself back and saw jesus
[1:39:46] standing and knew
[1:39:49] that that it was jesus
[1:39:53] jesus said unto her
[1:39:56] woman why whip it there
[1:40:00] home seek it down she's she's supposing

[1:40:56] which is to say master and
[1:40:59] jesus said unto her touch

[1:41:13] that it was the lord she was springing
[1:41:15] on him
[1:41:18] and she said he said touch me not
[1:41:23] touch me not
[1:41:27] praise the lord
[1:41:30] for i am not yet ascended to my father

[1:45:25] and close the door close the door
[1:45:28] when the doors were shot
[1:45:33] are we together
[1:45:41] the doors were shot where the disciples
[1:45:45] were the sample for fear of the jews
[1:45:48] came jesus
[1:45:51] and he stood in the amaze
[1:45:55] that those were shot mary testifying all
[1:45:59] of these things to them
[1:46:01] praise the lord the bible says
[1:46:05] then jesus steps in now if you take this
[1:46:09] account and you compare it
[1:46:12] to luke 24 you will realize
[1:46:15] before jesus stepped in here he met
[1:46:18] those other two men
[1:46:20] on the road of emmaus praise the lord
[1:46:24] and if you take the time that he
[1:46:26] resurrected
[1:46:28] and told mary don't touch me i'm going
[1:46:31] to the father
[1:46:36] he went to the father and he came back
[1:46:38] the same day
[1:46:40] he met the two men on the road of emails
[1:46:42] the same day
[1:46:44] he entered into the room
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:50] according to luke account he ate bread
[1:46:54] and fish
[1:46:55] the same day
[1:47:04] he died in one body
[1:47:07] resurrected in another body
[1:47:11] and told merit don't touch me
[1:47:15] because mortar and immortality don't
[1:47:18] mix in their body
[1:47:22] he extended in that body
[1:47:25] and came back in another body
[1:47:30] that can go through the walls but can
[1:47:33] still
[1:47:33] eat bread
[1:47:39] [Music]
[1:47:44] and he told thomas come and touch me
[1:47:50] look at my hand come and touch me it has
[1:47:53] wounds

[1:48:49] every one of them oh my goodness this is
[1:48:52] the spirit is it
[1:48:53] the injured of the lord he said he said
[1:48:55] the lord in the spirit he said no

[1:49:05] convinced he said okay
[1:49:06] your first bread your face food bread
[1:49:09] and fish
[1:49:13] praise the lord
[1:49:16] when he met the man on the road of in
[1:49:18] myers
[1:49:20] he says are you a stranger yeah what are
[1:49:22] you talking about he says oh
[1:49:23] you guys i told you all this thing the
[1:49:25] scripture will come to pass law of heart
[1:49:27] and all of that
[1:49:29] and debate him to come in it was about
[1:49:32] supper time
[1:49:33] he took car he took the bread and he
[1:49:36] broke it
[1:49:38] and the bible says in the eyes so open
[1:49:40] they knew that it was the lord
[1:49:43] amen and after supper they asked him to
[1:49:47] stay
[1:49:47] the bible said he vanished
[1:49:51] so he's dwelling in a body where he can
[1:49:53] appear and disappear
[1:49:57] he's rolling in the border where he can
[1:49:59] go through the wall
[1:50:00] and you don't have to get brother jordan
[1:50:02] to do some work here
[1:50:10] he can go through the war brother steve
[1:50:11] you don't need butterfly then how you
[1:50:13] call it
[1:50:14] something butterfly to pass the wall
[1:50:22] are we together
[1:50:29] but what i want us to appreciate and
[1:50:32] see here is
[1:50:35] the terrestrial body their celestial
[1:50:39] body
[1:50:40] and the glorified body
[1:50:46] praise the lord now
[1:50:50] when when when they got dead and they
[1:50:51] realized the stone was rolled away
[1:50:55] they saw the napkin they saw the the saw
[1:50:58] the cloth
[1:50:58] and everything that he was wrapping was
[1:51:00] lying there but his
[1:51:02] body was not there
[1:51:07] are we together his body was not there
[1:51:17] but then when he when he appeared to
[1:51:19] mary
[1:51:21] and he called her name and said
[1:51:25] mary
[1:51:28] she woke up to the reality she says oh
[1:51:31] my master
[1:51:32] she got excited he said no don't touch
[1:51:35] me
[1:51:37] amen now for all to
[1:51:40] to uh uh uh
[1:51:45] try to rush to embrace him or spring on
[1:51:47] him or whatever she wanted to do
[1:51:49] out of excitement not only that
[1:51:53] she recognized him by calling her name
[1:51:56] that brought her to recognize him but
[1:51:58] she could also
[1:51:59] identify that that was her law
[1:52:04] because if this person would have said
[1:52:06] mary
[1:52:07] and then they turn out to look
[1:52:09] completely different
[1:52:18] praise the lord if they turn out to look
[1:52:20] completely different
[1:52:22] she will say wait a minute where do you
[1:52:24] know me from
[1:52:28] but she recognized his voice and she
[1:52:31] also recognized his appearance
[1:52:38] praise the lord now follow me now catch
[1:52:41] the talk
[1:52:42] because the body is not in the tomb
[1:52:46] but here is the body appearing here
[1:52:49] and she's and he's saying don't touch me
[1:52:53] amen but she identified
[1:52:56] that's her law
[1:53:00] praise the lord this was the same thing
[1:53:02] that took place
[1:53:04] on my transfiguration
[1:53:08] when moses and elijah appeared
[1:53:12] to peter james and john they were in a
[1:53:15] body
[1:53:16] they could be identified
[1:53:20] but they could not be touched
[1:53:27] are we together amen
[1:53:35] praise the lord
[1:53:39] life story why they know
[1:53:42] moses they know elijah and moses and
[1:53:44] peter james and john
[1:53:46] recognized him and
[1:53:49] we recognized jesus after he returned
[1:53:53] back
[1:53:54] in his glorified body
[1:53:58] amen the bible says it does not yet
[1:54:02] appear
[1:54:03] what we shall be but
[1:54:06] we will have a body like his body
[1:54:10] for we shall see him as he is
[1:54:15] praise the lord
[1:54:19] so we will have one like that
[1:54:24] and he was eating and so forth
[1:54:28] that's in a glorified body pizza
[1:54:36] amen praise the lord don't don't
[1:54:39] don't worry if you have questions just
[1:54:41] line them up
[1:54:44] amen if you have questions just line
[1:54:46] them up send them to the dickens
[1:54:49] we will go through it amen praise the
[1:54:51] lord
[1:54:53] glory be to god so we realize here
[1:54:57] we have we have uh
[1:55:00] uh three bodies there there there are
[1:55:02] three bodies
[1:55:04] uh you know in the scripture the bible
[1:55:06] talks about paul
[1:55:08] talks about it there let's let's look
[1:55:09] there in in uh in corinthian i kind of
[1:55:12] slip up a little bit here and let's just
[1:55:14] read that from the scripture here and
[1:55:16] kind of a back it up with the word of
[1:55:18] god are we together
[1:55:20] amen or should we just stop here
[1:55:30] amen
[1:55:32] well i don't know what you were
[1:55:33] expecting to hear this morning
[1:55:37] praise the lord amen
[1:55:42] i don't know what you were expecting to
[1:55:44] hear this morning
[1:55:46] but i come to bring you the word of the
[1:55:48] lord
[1:55:50] amen i come to bring you the word of the
[1:55:54] lord
[1:55:55] i want to i just want to cut the reading
[1:55:58] down here because we could read and
[1:56:00] and read on and read on but read first
[1:56:02] corinthians chapter 15 when you get home
[1:56:04] let's drop down here
[1:56:08] to verse 35 but some men
[1:56:11] will say how are the dead raise
[1:56:14] up and with what body
[1:56:18] do they come how is the dead raised
[1:56:22] and what body do they come are we
[1:56:25] together
[1:56:27] the mystery of the body has always been
[1:56:30] the question
[1:56:31] the mystery of the body has been the
[1:56:33] argument between the pharisees
[1:56:34] and the sadducees that's what the
[1:56:36] sadducees did not believe
[1:56:38] in resurrection is it is because of this
[1:56:41] question
[1:56:42] praise the lord if this is a corruptible
[1:56:45] body
[1:56:46] if this is a corruptible body and we
[1:56:48] know all the things that this body goes
[1:56:50] through the lies
[1:56:51] that it tells the lies they believe the
[1:56:54] lies it feels and
[1:56:56] and everything and david says insane my
[1:56:58] mother conceived me coming to the world
[1:57:00] speaking lies
[1:57:01] and everything that this body goes
[1:57:03] through
[1:57:06] do you see why sometimes we have the
[1:57:09] idea
[1:57:11] that i can't wait to get out of this
[1:57:12] body
[1:57:16] praise the lord amen
[1:57:19] and sometimes i'm i mean you you you go
[1:57:22] through things
[1:57:23] until you just feel like giving yourself
[1:57:25] a slop
[1:57:28] how can i be foolish
[1:57:32] you just tell yourself when when will
[1:57:34] you ever learn saints
[1:57:38] when will you be smart
[1:57:41] oh my goodness i can't even believe i'm
[1:57:43] doing this
[1:57:44] jesus have mercy
[1:57:50] i remember when i first came to the lord
[1:57:53] i used to hit the brick wall
[1:57:56] i get so mad until i hit the brick wall
[1:58:04] because the question has always been
[1:58:08] what body if there is a resurrection
[1:58:12] what body
[1:58:15] will we be in now let's follow this a
[1:58:18] little bit here the beautiful reading
[1:58:20] here
[1:58:20] by the apostle paul he says
[1:58:24] thou food yes i am one i don't know what
[1:58:27] about you
[1:58:30] thou food that witch
[1:58:33] thou sow it
[1:58:37] is not quicking except it dies
[1:58:41] saint john chapter 12. that's what jesus
[1:58:44] said
[1:58:44] a separate corner we fall to the ground
[1:58:47] and die it do not come up
[1:58:53] so paul is quoting the same thing on an
[1:58:56] inspiration
[1:58:57] thou food that which is soul is not
[1:58:59] quick in except
[1:59:00] it died that and that which thou saweth
[1:59:05] thou saw with net
[1:59:08] their body that shall be
[1:59:14] but dead green
[1:59:17] it may
[1:59:22] it made chains of wheat all
[1:59:26] of some other green but god gave it it a
[1:59:30] body as it have pleased
[1:59:33] him and to ever see
[1:59:36] his own body let's take this literally
[1:59:40] brother wesley is not here but he could
[1:59:42] have been the one to better explain this
[1:59:44] to us
[1:59:45] and uh uh if you if you take a seed
[1:59:50] and and you put it in the ground the
[1:59:52] seed is in your hand is that the
[1:59:54] the life is covered by a shell it's in
[1:59:56] that seed
[1:59:57] you have it it has a body okay
[2:00:01] the sea has a body i was just telling
[2:00:03] someone and talking about
[2:00:04] the seed is not held with the shark and
[2:00:07] and and what and and and
[2:00:09] and some of the the you know the the the
[2:00:12] errors that we made through through the
[2:00:14] through the years
[2:00:15] you know what because that seed that you
[2:00:17] put to the ground
[2:00:19] according to what paul says the
[2:00:21] scripture and according to nature
[2:00:23] that she has to die amen
[2:00:27] a diet a dramatized in the earth it
[2:00:29] brings forth
[2:00:30] a little plant and that plant
[2:00:33] transports the life of that seed
[2:00:37] in all the stages
[2:00:41] that's exactly what brother branham
[2:00:44] taught us
[2:00:44] in uh uh the seed is not here with the
[2:00:47] shark
[2:00:48] that every stage was a transportation of
[2:00:52] the sea
[2:00:54] that's the reason why from every age
[2:00:57] god has an elect people
[2:01:02] he has a bride because those people
[2:01:05] were part of the transportation
[2:01:09] of the seed of the life the life was
[2:01:13] transporting through the pollen through
[2:01:17] the stem through the shark all of those
[2:01:20] stages
[2:01:21] the life was going trying to get back
[2:01:24] to the original sea now that sea
[2:01:28] dies and rotting in the earth but when
[2:01:31] the plane comes
[2:01:32] up and puffed forth another sea it looks
[2:01:35] exactly
[2:01:39] like the sea that goes to the ground
[2:01:42] that's why you don't
[2:01:43] you don't uh plain corn and get okra
[2:01:48] i mean we plain corn and then we get
[2:01:50] corn
[2:01:51] praise the lord so yeah for the same
[2:01:54] year to us
[2:01:55] every seed has a body he says all flesh
[2:02:00] is not the same flesh
[2:02:04] but there is one kind of a flesh of man
[2:02:08] another kind of beast that's why we
[2:02:10] don't eat humans
[2:02:13] because human flesh is flesh but it's
[2:02:14] not an eatable flesh
[2:02:18] amen and another flesh
[2:02:22] you know a fish
[2:02:26] that's when you i mean sometimes you
[2:02:27] fried and they taste sweet you know
[2:02:33] another flesh of burst turkey
[2:02:40] there is one glory of the sun
[2:02:44] and another glory of the moon and
[2:02:46] another glory of the skies
[2:02:49] and once ties different from another
[2:02:53] side in glory so also is the
[2:02:56] resurrection
[2:02:57] of the dead it is sown in
[2:03:01] corruption it is
[2:03:04] raised in incorruption
[2:03:08] it is sown in this honor
[2:03:12] praise the lord things we struggle with
[2:03:15] things we did that we regret off
[2:03:19] it goes in the ground with that but when
[2:03:23] it comes
[2:03:23] up amen it is sown
[2:03:27] in this honor it is sown it raised in
[2:03:30] glory sown in weakness
[2:03:32] and it raises in power
[2:03:37] are we together
[2:03:40] it is so a natural body
[2:03:44] ray is a spiritual body there is a
[2:03:47] natural body there is a spiritual body
[2:03:49] then he talks about
[2:03:51] you know uh uh you know the first
[2:03:54] the first adam and uh
[2:04:01] and quaking in spirit year
[2:04:06] praise the lord amen
[2:04:11] are we together now so when we look at
[2:04:14] this
[2:04:15] when we look at this i would i would
[2:04:17] just try to
[2:04:18] to kind of slide off yet a little bit
[2:04:22] and to be able to get your attention we
[2:04:24] will
[2:04:25] we'll get back to that so we we we
[2:04:27] realized here
[2:04:29] right from genesis one what is man
[2:04:32] that's that's my question
[2:04:33] what what what i am who i am that god
[2:04:36] has been so good
[2:04:38] to me amen that's that's the thought
[2:04:40] that is on our mind and as we traveling
[2:04:43] here
[2:04:43] to see that god made man in his image in
[2:04:46] his and his likeness
[2:04:48] and then he came and made man out of the
[2:04:50] dust of the earth genesis 2
[2:04:52] 7 and he breathed into the nostril of
[2:04:55] man and man became a living soul
[2:04:57] and show us two different beings there
[2:04:59] so we travel alone and we kind of
[2:05:01] are looking at all of this but we
[2:05:03] realize also
[2:05:05] the scripture allowed us
[2:05:09] to see here that
[2:05:13] paul in the bible
[2:05:18] the apostle paul he talks about
[2:05:21] something
[2:05:23] i want to i'm going to get away a little
[2:05:26] bit here
[2:05:28] praise the lord amen
[2:05:37] and
[2:05:41] and what i want to look at here is the
[2:05:44] other
[2:05:46] paul talks about something
[2:05:50] over in the book of second corinthians
[2:05:53] 12. and what he talks about
[2:05:56] here he talks about
[2:05:59] being caught up in the tear heavens
[2:06:05] this whole thing about soul body and
[2:06:08] spirit
[2:06:09] the whole thing about father son and the
[2:06:12] holy ghost
[2:06:13] was what god expressed in genesis 1
[2:06:18] 26 when he used that word
[2:06:22] let us praise the lord
[2:06:26] the hebrews they called that a priority
[2:06:30] of god it does not make him three
[2:06:33] distinct person
[2:06:34] but it makes him one person
[2:06:37] with attributes
[2:06:40] one person with many attributes and many
[2:06:43] ability
[2:06:46] praise the lord but all of these
[2:06:49] attributes that god have
[2:06:51] he choose to to
[2:06:54] to kind of manifest them or or classify
[2:06:58] them in a sense of showing it through
[2:07:01] a fatherhood a son shape
[2:07:04] and a holy ghost manifestation
[2:07:08] in a way he displayed them in
[2:07:12] in a dispensational form
[2:07:15] a father dispensation a sun dispensation
[2:07:19] and a dispensation of the holy ghost
[2:07:22] which is the same god
[2:07:26] praise the lord amen is there father son
[2:07:30] in the holy ghost yes there is
[2:07:33] it's truth it's their soul body and
[2:07:36] spirit yes we have it
[2:07:41] we have a soul body and spirit this is
[2:07:43] our this is my body
[2:07:45] you know and and and uh
[2:07:49] uh uh i have a sword and a spirit and
[2:07:51] all of that
[2:07:52] so so you will see how it runs through
[2:07:55] the scripture
[2:07:57] paul here talking in corinthians chapter
[2:07:59] 12 verse 2 i knew a man in christ
[2:08:03] above 14 years ago whether in the body i
[2:08:07] cannot tell
[2:08:09] or without the body i cannot tell
[2:08:13] god know it such
[2:08:17] and one caught up to
[2:08:20] the third heavens so yeah paul
[2:08:23] talking about a tear heavens
[2:08:26] now if he talks about it tear heaven the
[2:08:29] question comes to us
[2:08:31] is that a first yes there is
[2:08:34] is that a second yes there is
[2:08:38] praise the lord because if there is a
[2:08:41] ted there should be a first
[2:08:43] there should be a second and there
[2:08:44] should be a tear
[2:08:47] are we together praise the lord
[2:08:50] and now so all of this
[2:08:54] will help you to realize
[2:08:57] paul in ephesians chapter 1
[2:09:00] he says yet blessed be the god and
[2:09:03] father of our lord jesus
[2:09:06] who have put us in heavenly places
[2:09:09] in christ jesus he's identifying the
[2:09:13] believer's position
[2:09:15] praise the lord which of course is in
[2:09:18] the first heavens
[2:09:22] amen
[2:09:26] that is the first heaven but i will show
[2:09:28] to you here
[2:09:30] as we as we go together praise the lord
[2:09:35] are we together am i am i
[2:09:39] beginning to make you bold praise the
[2:09:42] lord
[2:09:44] amen
[2:09:47] i mean there are things we want to look
[2:09:49] at here revelation chapter 4
[2:09:51] let's just look at that john
[2:09:55] in revelation chapter 4 the scripture
[2:09:57] says
[2:09:58] year look at revelation chapter four as
[2:10:02] a scripture that i have in revelation
[2:10:03] chapter four
[2:10:04] as a quote up there that i want for us
[2:10:06] to also read through
[2:10:08] and this will this will this will help
[2:10:10] us
[2:10:11] are we together
[2:10:17] you know what i mean that sometimes we
[2:10:19] get so talking about things
[2:10:20] on earth you know and and
[2:10:24] i mean pulpits fill with with everything
[2:10:26] that is going on in politics and
[2:10:28] who win and woo cheating and all of that
[2:10:31] you know all of those things is for this
[2:10:33] earth
[2:10:35] you know it's for this earth i was going
[2:10:37] to preach a message called
[2:10:39] choose your rotten apples
[2:10:42] because brother branham says politics is
[2:10:45] rotting
[2:10:47] so whichever one you choose is your
[2:10:50] rotting apple
[2:10:52] praise the lord you know so i mean those
[2:10:55] things we
[2:10:56] are here should we be concerned about it
[2:10:58] yes the best way you can be concerned
[2:11:00] about it is to pray about it
[2:11:02] [Music]
[2:11:03] is to just pray about it is is not to
[2:11:06] get yourself working out and tweeting
[2:11:08] and posting and getting in all the
[2:11:10] debates
[2:11:11] because you cannot change it it's driven
[2:11:14] by
[2:11:14] prophecy prophecy is driving what is
[2:11:18] [Music]
[2:11:22] happening
[2:11:27] and we will take our time and come to
[2:11:29] church and just spend hours
[2:11:31] and be talking about the politicians and
[2:11:33] be talking about you know what i said in
[2:11:35] georgia you know what it said in
[2:11:36] california you know what he's saying
[2:11:42] instead of doing that i would rather
[2:11:43] preach the book of lamentation
[2:11:48] and be able to identify what we are
[2:11:50] going through in the book
[2:11:52] of lamentations i can show you verse by
[2:11:54] verse
[2:11:59] and tell you your position is to be a
[2:12:02] weeping scene
[2:12:05] to be one that is crying and say oh god
[2:12:09] is this word is this is it the kind of a
[2:12:11] word my children would grow in
[2:12:18] well sorry i'm not a politician so i can
[2:12:20] help you with anything on politics this
[2:12:22] morning
[2:12:23] amen revelation chapter 4 the bible says
[2:12:26] and after this
[2:12:28] i look and behold a door was open in
[2:12:32] heaven
[2:12:34] and the first voice which i heard
[2:12:38] was as it were a voice
[2:12:42] as it were a trumpet talking with me
[2:12:46] we said come up heather
[2:12:49] now that word come up hither we know
[2:12:52] it means to be cut away i mean
[2:12:56] come up higher is a word that means to
[2:12:58] be cut away just like
[2:13:00] elijah was taken by the cherub he was
[2:13:03] taken up higher
[2:13:05] now so you will see that
[2:13:08] just as there were three heavens
[2:13:11] listening to this god also allowed
[2:13:16] three men to visit those three regions
[2:13:22] let's read a little bit here praise the
[2:13:25] lord
[2:13:26] john said immediately that i was in the
[2:13:28] spirit i was in the spirit
[2:13:30] and behold a throne was set in heaven
[2:13:32] and one side on the throne
[2:13:34] john left the earth now christ
[2:13:37] had left the earth in the form of the
[2:13:39] holy spirit
[2:13:40] and had returned back
[2:13:44] into about it again today the body sits
[2:13:48] there as a memorial as a sacrifice
[2:13:51] we get into that a little bit down here
[2:13:54] we will see
[2:13:55] now immediately after he showed the
[2:13:58] end of the age of his work here which is
[2:14:02] revelation chapter 3.
[2:14:04] revelation chapter 3 shows the end of
[2:14:06] the church ages
[2:14:07] so immediately after john has seen the
[2:14:11] end of the church ages he was raptured
[2:14:17] amen he was caught up
[2:14:20] caught up in the spirit now watch and
[2:14:23] see you now
[2:14:24] and uh uh uh
[2:14:28] so in the end of the age i will show you
[2:14:31] what's going to be
[2:14:32] year after after the church ages he said
[2:14:35] john i can't talk to you down
[2:14:38] here year normal because i have left
[2:14:41] there amen i
[2:14:46] have come up higher come up here with me
[2:14:49] amen and i will show you what's going to
[2:14:52] take place
[2:14:53] year after all mine caught up
[2:14:56] in a vision caught up into glory
[2:15:00] his experience must must have been
[2:15:04] something like that of paul in
[2:15:08] second corinthians 2 second origin 12
[2:15:12] 2-4 if if you are putting it down
[2:15:16] paul was caught up one day
[2:15:21] and uh he was caught up
[2:15:26] in a vision too did you know that and he
[2:15:28] saw
[2:15:29] things that wasn't expedient
[2:15:33] for him so even talk about
[2:15:37] 14 days he was caught up into death
[2:15:41] never even mention it
[2:15:45] but listen at the difference between
[2:15:48] them
[2:15:49] what paul saw he was forbidding to speak
[2:15:52] of it
[2:15:53] or to tell it out to the public
[2:15:57] oh my i i don't believe
[2:16:00] he could do it why a little trip
[2:16:04] i took one day i have never got over it
[2:16:08] and will and never will he saw
[2:16:11] things that he couldn't he couldn't talk
[2:16:14] about
[2:16:16] i guess he didn't have words too
[2:16:19] he was caught up in the dead heavens
[2:16:22] though
[2:16:23] up in the tear heavens how different
[2:16:26] when john was caught up and and he
[2:16:29] seen jesus said write it in
[2:16:33] a book what you have seen
[2:16:37] and give it back send it back to the
[2:16:39] churches paul
[2:16:40] was forbidden to speak and john
[2:16:44] was even asked to put it in the book so
[2:16:47] that it could go all down through the
[2:16:51] edges so now what what are we picking up
[2:16:52] here talking about the tear heavens
[2:16:55] the second heaven and the first heaven
[2:17:00] the lord amen it's right and it's right
[2:17:03] in your bible
[2:17:04] now so we see here that uh
[2:17:07] uh when you when when you talk about
[2:17:09] that it's almost like
[2:17:11] you get over to revelation chapter 20
[2:17:14] and you talk
[2:17:14] about the first death and the second
[2:17:17] death
[2:17:20] praise the lord just like we have two
[2:17:23] births
[2:17:25] we have our first birth and we have our
[2:17:28] second birth
[2:17:29] is that not what the scripture says
[2:17:31] jesus saint john chapter 3
[2:17:33] you must be born again
[2:17:39] praise the lord john said there
[2:17:42] in in saint john that we are born of the
[2:17:46] seed
[2:17:46] incorruptible which is the word of god
[2:17:52] so we have a first birth and we have
[2:17:55] our second birth our first birth is by
[2:17:57] our natural parents that brought us over
[2:17:59] to the earth
[2:18:01] praise the lord the new birth comes by
[2:18:04] the word of god
[2:18:07] amen now we cannot talk
[2:18:11] about a celestial body a terrestrial
[2:18:14] body
[2:18:14] a glorified body and we don't talk about
[2:18:17] birth and death
[2:18:20] because to go from one body to another
[2:18:22] body there is an
[2:18:23] agent called death that you have to
[2:18:26] travel through
[2:18:28] that's why the scriptures show us there
[2:18:30] with our lord jesus
[2:18:32] there is an anger there is an agent
[2:18:35] there is a chanter
[2:18:37] praise the lord and that is that's what
[2:18:39] happened
[2:18:40] when we go from one birth to another
[2:18:42] birth
[2:18:43] i mean the new verb is not church
[2:18:45] membership
[2:18:46] the new verb is not church
[2:18:48] identification
[2:18:50] the new verb comes just like paul said
[2:18:53] when the sea is put into the ground they
[2:18:55] have to die
[2:18:58] for it to come for it to have a new
[2:19:00] birth for it to be quaking
[2:19:03] it has to die praise the lord
[2:19:08] and you know that's what this puppet is
[2:19:09] set here for
[2:19:11] see the pulpit with a little cross
[2:19:13] before it
[2:19:15] it is your stomp stone for your new
[2:19:18] birth
[2:19:22] this puppet is your tombstone for your
[2:19:25] new birth
[2:19:26] judgment begin in the house of god
[2:19:28] that's what the scripture says
[2:19:30] that's why the word of god is preached
[2:19:32] for to bring you
[2:19:34] a new birth to pull your spirit to this
[2:19:37] altar
[2:19:38] to pull those nature of loss and anger
[2:19:42] and things
[2:19:42] that are all that was given to us by our
[2:19:45] first birth
[2:19:46] to bring them right to this altar and
[2:19:48] bury them
[2:19:53] that's why the blue pit is fall
[2:19:56] praise the lord
[2:20:01] amen glory be to god
[2:20:04] i mean we can talk about all of these
[2:20:05] changes of the body and having large
[2:20:07] cuts i can line up to you
[2:20:09] and just get you excited but the way
[2:20:12] there
[2:20:14] is a way by birth and death
[2:20:19] revelation chapter 20 let's read that
[2:20:21] quickly we'll be able to identify
[2:20:24] our first death and second death first
[2:20:26] resurrection and second resurrection
[2:20:32] are we together
[2:20:38] you want to enjoy a new body without
[2:20:41] death even our lord jesus
[2:20:44] for him to step in as a celestial body
[2:20:46] and tell mary don't touch me
[2:20:48] he went by the way of death
[2:20:51] then you want a heavenly body
[2:20:55] call a teal funny body without
[2:20:58] death
[2:21:05] revelation chapter 20
[2:21:10] verse and i saw thrones and they they
[2:21:14] sat upon them and judgment was given to
[2:21:16] them
[2:21:17] and i saw the souls of them
[2:21:21] that were beheaded for the witness of
[2:21:23] jesus christ and for the word of god
[2:21:26] and wish her now worship the beast
[2:21:30] neither his image and have not received
[2:21:32] his mark upon their forehead
[2:21:35] all on their hands and and and delayed
[2:21:38] and reigned with christ a thousand years
[2:21:41] the millennium and the rest of the dead
[2:21:45] lived not again until the thousand years
[2:21:49] were finished this is
[2:21:53] their first resurrection
[2:21:56] praise the lord this is their first
[2:22:00] resurrection
[2:22:06] blessed and holy is he
[2:22:09] that have part in the first resurrection
[2:22:13] on such the second death
[2:22:17] have no power
[2:22:25] the second death has
[2:22:28] no power
[2:22:33] what is the scripture saying peter said
[2:22:35] judgment begin in the house of god
[2:22:37] if the righteous will be scarcely saved
[2:22:39] where were they unguarded and sinners
[2:22:41] appear
[2:22:44] so which means we taste our first
[2:22:48] death by the word of god
[2:22:51] we tease our first death by the
[2:22:53] experience
[2:22:54] of the baptising of the holy ghost
[2:22:57] by the fire of god that comes and
[2:23:00] consumes sin
[2:23:01] in the light burned acceptance of
[2:23:04] jealousy
[2:23:05] and anger from the heart of the believer
[2:23:08] [Applause]
[2:23:10] we experience our first death right here
[2:23:15] when we give our heart not in part
[2:23:19] when we give our heart not in part not
[2:23:22] just to become a church member
[2:23:24] but to be a son of god to be a daughter
[2:23:27] of god
[2:23:27] when we give our heart completely
[2:23:32] then you experience your first death
[2:23:35] which is your second birth your first
[2:23:39] death is your second birth
[2:23:41] [Music]
[2:23:44] praise the lord amen
[2:23:48] and that's what the church needs that's
[2:23:51] what
[2:23:51] the believers need for the hour that we
[2:23:54] are living in
[2:23:56] that's what paul meant when he said make
[2:23:57] your call and election show
[2:24:00] he said make sure that you have died
[2:24:02] brother
[2:24:04] make sure that you have died and born
[2:24:05] again
[2:24:07] that's what he meant
[2:24:10] praise the lord
[2:24:14] are we together blessed and holy is he
[2:24:22] that have part in the first resurrection
[2:24:26] on such the second death have no power
[2:24:31] but they shall be
[2:24:34] priests of our god and of christ
[2:24:37] and shall reign with him a thousand
[2:24:40] years
[2:24:42] praise the lord so we have
[2:24:46] a first birth a first death
[2:24:49] a first resurrection
[2:24:53] praise the lord i could be a little bit
[2:24:55] extreme with that but i will leave you
[2:24:56] for now
[2:24:59] praise the lord because paul said
[2:25:01] they're talking about the new birth in
[2:25:04] in the book of ephesians he said we were
[2:25:06] once
[2:25:08] we were once sinners dead in sin
[2:25:13] but he have quickened us
[2:25:18] he has quickened us wish there were one
[2:25:21] deadly sin
[2:25:22] he have quickness by grace are we saved
[2:25:25] in christ jesus that's what he said in
[2:25:26] the book of ephesians
[2:25:31] so young people i want you to grab this
[2:25:34] this is your body your your
[2:25:35] your bible school or your sunday school
[2:25:37] for you to grab it and remember it
[2:25:39] we have a first birth
[2:25:43] a first death the first resurrection
[2:25:47] and there is a second birth there
[2:25:50] is a second death there is a second
[2:25:54] resurrection
[2:25:55] we can get into the the equation of it
[2:25:58] amen praise the lord
[2:26:02] we come into the world we all here were
[2:26:04] born by parents
[2:26:05] we all here experience the first birth
[2:26:09] the evidence that you experience the
[2:26:11] first birth you are looking at me i'm
[2:26:13] talking to you
[2:26:16] amen we all experience the first birth
[2:26:20] we were born by our parents praise the
[2:26:23] lord
[2:26:25] amen
[2:26:31] and for us
[2:26:38] for us to experience the first
[2:26:41] resurrection
[2:26:43] we must go by the way of the second
[2:26:46] death
[2:26:49] praise the lord we must go by the way no
[2:26:52] of the second birth not second death
[2:26:54] we must go by the way of the second
[2:26:56] birth
[2:26:58] which is to be born again praise the
[2:27:02] lord
[2:27:03] that's what i wanted to get to with with
[2:27:04] all of these things this morning
[2:27:06] i realized that i'm far past my time now
[2:27:09] i have to look for the place to close
[2:27:10] here amen
[2:27:14] but that's what i want to get your
[2:27:15] attention
[2:27:17] because as we look through this
[2:27:21] and see the amazing thing that the
[2:27:24] scripture
[2:27:25] tells us that if this ethnic tabernacle
[2:27:28] be dissolved
[2:27:31] you know paul actually did not use the
[2:27:34] word be
[2:27:35] distraught but be dissolved
[2:27:41] is because the same way god
[2:27:45] changed his max amen
[2:27:49] that's the same way he used us like
[2:27:53] brother branham talks about
[2:27:54] the future home amen he says heaven and
[2:27:58] earth will pass away
[2:27:59] there be a fire that comes down and
[2:28:01] consume the elements of the earth
[2:28:04] but it's going to be the same earth that
[2:28:06] god is going to renovate
[2:28:08] so it's going to be this same body that
[2:28:10] god is going to renovate
[2:28:16] it's a changing of the body
[2:28:20] is one body sucking the other one
[2:28:24] so it was not in a form like jesus was
[2:28:27] lying in the grave
[2:28:29] and mirror magdalene saw him outside no
[2:28:32] his body was not there but he have took
[2:28:35] on another body that she could not touch
[2:28:40] but yeah he came down in another body
[2:28:43] that he could eat
[2:28:44] and they could touch him
[2:28:47] have scars on him but can't believe
[2:28:51] he didn't say thomas come come come and
[2:28:54] see see my take time now take time don't
[2:28:56] don't don't do it hi
[2:28:58] because it will pay me take time you see
[2:29:02] it says no come and put your hand in it
[2:29:09] because that body can't feed pain
[2:29:20] praise floyd
[2:29:23] praise the lord it's the joy
[2:29:28] that you have serving god in this body
[2:29:33] the joy that the saints the martials of
[2:29:36] the ages had
[2:29:38] been fed to the lion
[2:29:42] they were feared to the lion and the
[2:29:44] lion ravaged their body
[2:29:45] before that lion could touch them they
[2:29:48] stepped into another body
[2:29:51] and they saw that body being ravaged
[2:29:56] but you would come down and pick up that
[2:29:58] body again
[2:30:01] you would come down and pick up that
[2:30:03] body but bam say even if it's just a
[2:30:06] spoonful
[2:30:06] of dust that is left
[2:30:10] of your body you'll come back and speak
[2:30:12] to it
[2:30:15] and say scotty come up
[2:30:18] and you just step right in it my
[2:30:21] goodness
[2:30:23] if this athlete tabernacle be dissolved
[2:30:30] we have another one
[2:30:37] there is a mystery there in the
[2:30:39] manifestation of this body
[2:30:41] i'll leave it for another time but uh uh
[2:30:44] yeah our time is up here so i wanted to
[2:30:47] run you through
[2:30:48] uh the first day of second death and
[2:30:50] first birth second birth
[2:30:52] and also get down to uh we get down to
[2:30:55] the region of the lust
[2:30:57] where we talk talk about just like we
[2:31:00] talked about the the the first heaven
[2:31:02] and the seventh
[2:31:03] the the second heaven wonder pull out
[2:31:06] here from uh from peter we'll find time
[2:31:09] to talk about that also
[2:31:10] and and and shows the reason
[2:31:14] why brother branham couldn't preach
[2:31:16] about hell
[2:31:17] recently that i was reading the book of
[2:31:19] isaiah
[2:31:20] and and there was something that came
[2:31:22] out in the scripture
[2:31:24] you know how the reason why the subject
[2:31:27] of hell
[2:31:28] has been uh you know such
[2:31:31] not a confusion is because the the the
[2:31:35] the stripes the one that wrote the bible
[2:31:37] the word that it took
[2:31:39] held from hades you know
[2:31:43] in in in in in in the asian day
[2:31:46] it meant something there are two words
[2:31:48] there there is hades that means the
[2:31:50] grave
[2:31:50] and and and sean and uh which of course
[2:31:54] this word
[2:31:55] also came from a place where they used
[2:31:58] to go
[2:31:59] uh and and and burn the bodies
[2:32:02] you know and and and give bodies to
[2:32:05] idols and burn and all of that so
[2:32:08] we will look into that if the lord gave
[2:32:10] us grace we'll take time and look into
[2:32:12] it
[2:32:13] but this is all in a place to bring us
[2:32:15] to the place
[2:32:18] to give us an idea
[2:32:21] why god
[2:32:24] take a special interest in you
[2:32:30] amen because
[2:32:33] you have a living soul
[2:32:37] that living soul move from one body
[2:32:42] to another
[2:32:46] that's the only thing you carry
[2:32:52] all the things the cells and then and
[2:32:55] the elements we get from our parents
[2:32:58] they stay with this body
[2:33:03] god breath into man
[2:33:08] and he became a living soul
[2:33:12] what is man that thou are so
[2:33:16] mindful of him why because that breath
[2:33:19] that he breathed into
[2:33:21] man was a part of himself
[2:33:27] that he did not give to the angels
[2:33:30] he never gave it to the birds he didn't
[2:33:33] give it to the animals
[2:33:36] but he gave it to his son
[2:33:39] a part of himself
[2:33:42] and to know that every day we carry a
[2:33:45] part of god
[2:33:48] in us
[2:33:52] as we go to work as we go to school
[2:33:58] another time when someone make you angry
[2:34:01] think about the part of god that is in
[2:34:03] you
[2:34:04] before you respond back to them
[2:34:10] think about the part of god that you are
[2:34:12] caring
[2:34:15] when god draws that part of himself to
[2:34:17] himself
[2:34:18] you'll be a dead body they will call the
[2:34:20] ambulance
[2:34:22] you will be called as ice
[2:34:27] what is man that thou i'm mindful of him
[2:34:32] sometimes we fill our mind with our
[2:34:35] achievement
[2:34:37] we look at how all the things that we
[2:34:40] have acquired
[2:34:42] and the things and we just think that's
[2:34:44] what make us what we are
[2:34:47] but i'm telling you this morning there
[2:34:49] are many people that are better than you
[2:34:53] that are lying down looking at the
[2:34:54] ceiling
