it will actually turn into war but there's a long story but basically there's a class system there and the elite do basically own everything and they raise prices on the fares on public transit which not a lot of people have cars down in Chile and there are riots they burn down buildings they burned metro stations they burned buses there's a lot going on down there there's a lot of stuff in news a few people have died this is just in the last couple of days that this is all just kind of ignited so we would definitely want to keep the Saints down the others a curfew in place there's military lockdown so we just want to keep the the Saints down there and prayer does seem to be doing better today but just the last few days have been pretty pretty wild so let's just go to Lourdes and prayer

we can do other than believe you Lord God we've just come Lord God to give you glory to give you praise Lord God father we just thank you for all you've done certainly we've got requests but father we don't want to forget to stop and be grateful we think of the the one leper that came back and said thank you he came back to give God praise everyone else was happy to kind of just run along on their way enjoying it but one came back and you main special note of that it's in the Bible for a reason and father may we not be like the nine that just went our way and just kind of forgot about it God may we be the one that comes back and says thank you Lord God I read a quote this week that if the only prayer we ever said was thank you it would be enough and that's true Lord God and we want to give you thanks this morning and certainly bring these prayer burdens to you Lord God we want to remember further ones mom Lord God thank you that he's able to be down there with her and Lord God father you know all about it father you know the end from the beginning you know what's brought this situation to pass Lord God father you you hold her healing in your hands Lord God father and God

I'm standing I'm standing where's the Lord I'm standing amen amen praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord it's good to be in the house of Lord this morning it's good to be with you all you know I think of this sometimes I'm not gonna do it this morning I thought about it but you know when they said when they found the book of the law they opened the word I think it was with um Ezra yeah and they they open up the book of the word and they stood they read the whole book and they stood and then they said it they they you know they praised and all this stuff is like wow that's amazing what if we did that what if we did that what if we just stood the whole because it's standing on the promises you know there's there's a there's a a I'm gonna create a doctrine out of it or something like that but I was thinking with that it's like it's not sitting on the promises sitting on the promises is not using them you're just kind of like yeah they're back there I know they're there but you're not you're just kind of sitting on it you're just let me think about sitting on it it's standing I'm standing I'm erect this this takes effort to stand to stand on something and I just love that song and love the energy in here this morning praise the Lord he is here how many believe God's here this morning amen praise the Lord we're relying and we're just trusting in him and we just love the Lord this morning amen amen musicians you may be seated let's just jump right into the word we'll go to Psalms 18 a men one of my favorite passages of Scripture and I just I just love this a man will just read a few different chunks in here amen praise the Lord if you're there say Amen Psalms 18 I will love thee O Lord my strength the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved for mine enemies the sorrows of death compassed me and floods of ungodly men made me afraid the sorrows of Hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress I called upon the Lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice praise the Lord he heard my voice let's just pray let's pray and we'll keep reading the passage dear father we love you Lord God we thank you Father we've all been here Lord God and even if we don't realize that we're there we are the Satan's always compassing us about we always have this body of this death this flesh compassing us about lord god and cry unto you and you hear us you heard us and you listened to us you pay attention to us we're not calling out in vain we're not just crying out to some some some ether often them know where we know that your God and you hear us Lord Ghana we're so thankful and we're so utterly grateful for that Lord God we're so thankful that you hear us Lord God that you're a Living God we're not just reciting a rosary we're not just hoping that we might make it someday but we can be certain we can be certain that your God and you hear us we can be certain of our destination we can be certain we're so grateful of that the morning father come take these pages take these words Lord God come speak to our hearts this morning Lord God and Lord may we just get a hold of you this morning Lord God that it wouldn't be just a passing in one ear and out the other Lord God but may we grab hold on to what we would have need of this morning Lord God father take us beyond our own thinking or beyond notes or beyond ideas Lord God and father may we just feast around your table this morning we just commit into your hands now father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated amen in my distress I called upon the Lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came you or him even into his ears then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth there went of a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured excuse me I can't see devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yeah he did fly upon the wings of the wind and I love this you know we might not see it but God is moving we cry unto Him and God is moving we might not see it with our physical eyes but I love this passage because it paints a picture of what's happening what is actually going on behind the scenes that God is moving God is moving in our in our day today and it's our job to believe and to wait upon him to wait upon him praise the Lord I love this this just jumping down we won't read the whole passage but later on and this I highly recommend reading Psalms 18 and just getting excited about it the whole thing because it's just wonderful but jumping down to verse 31 for who is God save the Lord or who is a rock save our God it is God that Gerdes me with strength and maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like Hinds feet and sendeth me upon high places which you actually look at this it's talking about like a deer but you could also look at it he's setting it like Hinds to eat mountain goats these guys are ridiculous rock climbers like we can't even match them they're just amazing just going up sheer cliffs they're just he makes our our feet like Hinds feet that we can get up into the rock where no man can follow us nothing can follow us were able to just get so anchored up in that rock that no one can follow us he teaches my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms that was also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand hath holding me up and thy gentleness hath made me great praise the Lord amen I just love that passage um we're gonna go into well we'll just jump right into Matthew 15 verse 22 and 22 through 28 pray for me this morning I just I loved what brother brother Dan was speaking this morning thank you brother Dan I was I was having a hard time this morning Satan was fighting me a lot but you started saying something and it lined up exactly with my notes and I was like praise God were on the right path we are on the right path and I'm just so grateful for that this morning thank the Lord Matthew 15 22 and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said I am NOT sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me same thing lord help me but he answered and said it is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat o the crumbs which fall from the master's table amen then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith great is thy faith be it unto unto thee even as thou wilt and their daughter was made whole from that very hour I want us and I say this almost every time is I want us to look at scriptures like we've never seen them before because we hear them or like oh here's the three sermons this relates to and we start to like we get it in here but we need to engage with the Word of God from here from our hearts not from our heads not just an intellectual parsing out and like oh you know let's just line up all this intellectual idea but it's with our hearts if we could if we could get the word truly into our hearts and live from that it would change our lives and it does and it is changing our lives but what I love here is you know here's someone God told her know Jesus told her no she didn't really have a claim to stand on but she was persistent same thing we we look at the the woman who touched the hem of His garment now of course she was a child of Israel she didn't have a scripture to stand on like I'm gonna get healed if I touch the hem of His garment but she believed she believed in their heart and she persisted and she Moochie what she stepped out on faith on that even the Centurion that came to Jesus we all know the story might Jesus said he'd never seen such faith never seen such faith how does this Gentile know how to connect with God that way how was he able to he didn't have a scripture to stand on there was nothing there was nothing in the Bible for him to be able to stand on yet that and yet God honored that faith why because he was bold he was determined he went and he he he saw that I'm gonna read this this 1960 to persevere it if it would be called the text I would like to take one word for a text and that is the word perseverance Severus Webster says is to be persistent persistent and making a goal to do something to be perseverant is to persist and before you can be persistent you have to have an idea what you're being persistent about and men through all ages that's ever tried to achieve something has been persistent man in order to be persistent I might quote again is to know what you're after and if you do not know you're not certain of your standing but when you thoroughly understand what it is what you're after and are satisfied you're going to do it then you can be persistent and really persist be persistent holding on holding on to God and a brother Dan said it I have this this scripture right here as a double minded man is unstable in all of his ways and that far too often is Christianity if far too often brother Branham said it he said a bet someone right off the street a ranked sinner often is more likely to get healed than a Christian because they come in they hear it and they believe it they're not so caught up in here with what this scripture and then o are they're so busy crunching it out so so busy crunching it out in their minds that they miss it they miss grabbing it in the now in the today that God said so I believe it and that's the only thing that matters that I can take hold upon that and I can run with it in determination in persistence 19:51 the angel of the Lord now the people's attitude some people make up their mind that when they come to the meeting that they're coming to find something to criticize well now st. and we'll be sure to show you that and if you come to service with an anxiety or an anxiousness and you hold on to that st. will be sure to make sure that you find that if you've got this worry or you've got this doubt this little pet doubt that you're just holding on to and you're just you know aha but what about this what about this and over note you're feeding you're feeding it theyíve they've even found this it's even science says it it's all over the Bible what you look at what you expect is what you get they call it in science it's the reticular activating system everyone all right everyone look around the room now close your eyes think of something in the room that was Navy can you remember what was Navy in the room okay now open your eyes and look around and see what was Navy or like a dark blue or blue color okay there's some in here huh there you go it's right in front of you okay now now I didn't see it it's funny I we can go through a bunch of exercises on this and I won't really go into it but it's it's literally weird we are predisposed to notice the things that we pay attention to the things that we pay and we see more and more of it it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts is that you we know we all know people who all they do is complain it doesn't matter what it is it doesn't matter what's happening to them they're going to find something to complain about something to pick out about it's like it could be a beautiful day outside like it is right now it's like beautiful there's no snow on the ground the leaves are changing it's sunny and they were just all they would be talking about would be like oh but it's like it's a little chilly outside and that's just uh you know it'd be so much nicer and then you know what the same people during summer it's just way too hot outside if it wasn't humid outside and it's the same thing they're never gonna be happy there because what are they focusing on what are they paying attention to what water what are they setting their sights in their eyes on that's what they're gonna get that's what they're going to get st. and we'll give you something to criticize well now Satan and once again I bring up science only because they've just they're all they're doing is they're recognizing a pattern that's all they're doing we already know what God's Word says and it's true but I like to see those things sometimes because even if a man in their weakness and their their inability to find truth really because they're constantly running around but if they even find a pattern and like ho well that's kind of true that it shows really like the guys this is easy what are we focusing on what are we looking at what are we what are we up are we looking at our trial or are we looking to God are we looking to his word now Satan will be sure to show you that if you come determined you're going to find something good God will show it to you now it's your attitude dear Christian come determined and I think I threw up there the the definition of determined and I just love this having made a firm decision and being resolved not to change it determined determined and you look at this this woman was determined she was going to talk to Jesus she was going to talk to Jesus we talked we know the scripture of the unjust judge jesus said it as a parable for a reason determined I'm going to talk to God I love what brother Dan said this morning it's that the key difference is in are we asking to satisfy our own lusts and there's something else brother Perry Greene had brought out once that the brother Branham had talked with brother Perry Greene about three other things to know the will of God so there's motive and objective brother Branham taught us that then there's three other things is one is it in line with the scripture there's no scripture against it you know it's in line you can be confident because it's in line with the Word of God I'm not praying God should I open up a casino that would be out of line with the Word of God okay it's in line with the scripture God will give you the desire to do it no one will be coercing you to do it you know it's funny because we are read the scripture God loves a cheerful Giver no one reads the next part then that's actually half of a verse God loves a cheerful Giver not out of necessity but from a willing heart so not out of coercion not out of someone saying somebody needs to do this or even you sang man someone just needs to do this no and obviously like sometimes we're in we're enduring with something but in time it's your desire you have the desire with God's will and then God will provide a way to do it he will give you the opportunity to do it so I'm just sprinkling those three in there we're not really jumping into so much of the will of God more so about determination and persistence because too often we know brother branham taught us that the Word of God is like an atomic bomb to the church when Satan came to tempt Jesus Jesus didn't use any of his divine power to defeat him he used the same tools you have which is the Word of God the exact same tools so that any Christian can go to the word with the same weapon of warfare as Jesus Christ think about that the same weapons Jesus had Satan's gonna come to you all the time say oh well you know you're not you know you're not Jesus you know you're it's it's all you know anything you can do to keep you from picking up the word he will do it Satan has always come with the word to keep you from using the word to keep you distracted to keep us running angles on it well is this really so we're not certain we're not certain we can't be certain so we don't step out because we're not certain but if it's in line with God's Word why not why not we get too caught up in in this idea of well maybe it's not the will of God did His Word say it or not did His Word say it or not amen 19:59 be certain of God it steams strange when a person has done all that they can do that they have fulfilled every request no I'm gonna just jump down if you're certain of God you can take his word for anything he says if you're not certain that he is God and this is his is the Bible then you'd better be careful of what you're doing but if you're certain meet his requirements then faith takes its solemn rest faith cannot be based upon the shifting sands of man's theology but faith takes its solemn stand upon the eternal everlasting rock of God's eternal faith there at rests unmovable it knows this is Sookie this is the foundation of our faith is it knows that God is and a reward of those that diligently seek Him so it starts with that of being certain of God if we are certain that he is certain that he is and if we can be certain that he is then is his word true or not is his word - or not and if it is true then we ought to be able to stand up fully upon it fully upon it determined not waiting for a great move of God or some kind of a sensation but wholly believing and holding on to it praise the Lord perseverance 1963 now there's only one thing can hold this sword of course we know the word is the sword that's the hand of faith the hand of faith is the only thing that can yield this sword of faith sword of the word now you might have a weak arm just enough to pick it up for justification you're so weak just enough to pick it up for justification maybe that's all you can cut through but this sword of the word will cut free every promise that God made in it if they got a good strong arm of faith holding it there I believe God for my healing Bible leave God for my baptism God made the promise and faith holds this sword it'll cut her out of the rock yonder every promise of God can be cut free by the Word of God for it is a sword she had many hindrances but her faith in davines she was talking he once again talking about the same woman she had many hindrances but her faith in have any you might have a lot of hindrances every person that starts out to meet Christ will find you got a lot of hindrances but your faith don't have any faith don't have no hindrance faith has hairs on his chest great big muscles reasons raised up reasons raised up and said you know it's reasonable once again coming in and questioning the word faith pulls his muscles back and sticks out his big chest and says shut up set down the reason jumps over in a corner and takes his stool right faiths got big muscles he means what he says praise the Lord Lord Lord help me um God a double minded man is unstable in all of his ways maybe this is true maybe this is true you ever come to a problem in a situation and we're praying praying praying God do something God come you know what's what's the deal and of course it does come by revelation but there's scripture in the word for it there's scripture in the word for it I'll supply all your needs did he say it or did he not is it not in the word or is it not he did he said it now it's up to us to believe it and to hold on to it and and to to grab hold on to that to be determined to be determined because God God God is the one who brings it to pass God brings his word to pass the outcome is not our responsibility the outcome of the Word of God is not our responsibility it's our responsibility to believe it to simply hold on to it you're still with me okay I feel like I'm doing a terrible job you guys pray for me no like I can't I can't get it the way it's coming to me I can't say it I'm just I'm just trusting the Lord that he's gonna speak to however it needs to go out because like I was shouting earlier today about this so Isaiah 54 the Lord God will help me will help me once again you look at so often in the scripture where David he's crying out to God and I love that he's saying you know and and you heard me and you know so often we're looking for this great sense a you know brother Dan was talking about is that we pray and pray and pray and we get an expectation on how God's going to do something and sometimes we also get an expectation that God is going to do something like in this moment right now like we're gonna get a sensation and we're like oh I just feel so much peace I know it's taken care of it's taken care of whether or not you feel peace it's taken care of whether or not you feel peace whether or not you feel joy whether or not you feel security whether or not you feel good or you feel bad it's already taken care of because God said so we are not a religion based on emotion and sensation we'd go to the Pentecostals if we wanted to do that I mean really we could go almost anywhere else and get that I mean we can if we can go to a rock concert and get amazing feelings I mean really we're not here to have a weak faith to just cut through enough to say I'm just a struggling Christian that's not us that's not me that's not you absolutely not we are more than overcomers through Christ Jesus by by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony the word of our testimony we agree with the word we say we say what the word says and we agree with it beyond our thinking beyond our feelings it doesn't matter if you feel good it doesn't and it like it doesn't it doesn't matter if you feel bad certainly we enjoy it when it feels great and it's it's better to feel good yes yes and we're like oh man this is a horrible day you know we feel those feelings sometimes we're just we those emotions those waves crashing if we're made of sand it's going to affect us the waves are gonna come in but if we're a rock it's going to break when it hits us it's going to break and there's only one thing that's a rock and that's the Word of God it's unchanging unmovable it's certain we can count on it it doesn't matter that the shifting of ideologies and theologies and ideas and man's warping of you know should this be true or that be true and sir some of those things are fine what gets better gas mileage you know that doesn't matter it's irrelevant it's irrelevant in the grand scheme of things but this is true this is true for the entire ages it wouldn't matter if we went on another million years this would still be true because it's it's it's it's it's the source code of life it is connected into the universe and the galaxies and our DNA and cell structure and everything it's wrapped up into this praise the Lord amen for the Lord God will help me therefore shall I not be confounded therefore have I set my face like flint I set my face like flint I'm just determined I'm determined if the scripture says David encouraged himself in the Lord he didn't wait for something else to come along you know you look at David in that passage they just come back from a mighty battle they come back to I think Ziklag and their wives and their kids and everything just got kidnapped and taken away it's like that's a pretty rough time these men are about to string him up I mean that's literally what's about to happen I mean this is this is a major you know this is a major problem right now it's like he's about to get killed and this is the worst possible scenario and David encouraged himself in the Lord you know we you even look at that that doesn't necessarily mean that like God came down and spoke to David in a sense but he brought it to his remembrance God said this about me remember David was anointed king he knew that the prophet of that day had come in and had anointed him he was riding on that promise you look at how many years David ran away in exile like he's just running for his life literally he's that he's the song he's running for his life but anybody asks you what's the matter with me ha ha he's anointed to be the coming king and he's running for his life yet he's holding on he's holding on to the promise of God he's holding on even when you look at it you look at it as him being inspired God God God I'm crying out to you and in an instant he comes back into speaking faith and and and prays to God in spite of the trial he's going into that God will he God Don will remember me God will come to my aid therefore have I set my face like flint and I know that I shall not be ashamed and this this is the attitude of every Christian concerning God's Word you got a need there's a strip sure for it before the sensations come before any evidence any evidence comes I've set my face like flint God I'm going to hold on to this like Jacob wrestling with the angel I'm never going to let go of this I'm never going to let go of this this word applies to me I know it I can see myself in the word and I'm not letting go of you I'm going to set my face like flint and when the critics come and it might not even be these critics it might be this critic when this critic comes I will say I know that I shall not be ashamed I know that I will not be ashamed because I'm set my face like flint and though he slay me yet I'll trust in him I'll trust in him I'll hold on to that word I'll hold on to that word I'm never going to let go of that never going to let go of it and that's holding the word in a strong hand of faith talk about David's mighty men of valor there was one man of Valor that he was fighting Philistines for more than a day solid and it was so much so that his hand clave to the sword let that be our testimony that our hand clave to the sword you know we might be beaten down we might be struggling but we keep swinging that I'm doesn't matter if I die doesn't matter if this sickness takes me I'm gonna keep on swinging going to keep on fighting I'm gonna hold on to that sword gonna keep on fighting no matter what happens I'm gonna keep on fighting yes yes yes he is Mir that justifies me I love this he is Mir that justifies me who will contend with me let us stand together who is mine adversary let him come near to me you know what he's saying he's saying I've set my face like flint I know I won't be ashamed bring it on bring it on that's exactly what he's saying who will contend with me let us stand together come here come here who is mine adversary let him come near to me come here bring it on bring it on because I've got my face set like flint I'm not going to retreat bring it on bring it on bring it on yes bring it on behold the Lord God will help me who is he that shall condemn me lo they shall wax old as a garment the MAS shall eat them up who is among you that feareth the Lord that obey the voice of his servant that walketh in darkness and half no light she was talking about someone who is he that it's believes in God but is walking in darkness there in a trial the valley of the shadow of death let him trust in the name of the Lord and stay upon his god stay upon his god stay upon his god our responsibility is not to bring it to pass our responsibility is to believe believe in a surrendered absolutely surrendered trust that god i I'm jumping on this thing I am my boats are burned my bridges are burned this is the only thing this is the only thing there is no plan B there's no option B but I am totally committed totally committed I'm determined I'm determined I'm determined bring it on praise the Lord amen he that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god praise the Lord Hebrews 12 wherefore seeing we are also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God jumping down now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous we know the passage but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby exorcised gods or coach gods or coached their exercise thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down in the feeble knees looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God and I love this I've been thinking a lot about well let me read this next passage real quick Melchizedek 1955 how we dwelt on that how Abraham patiently enduring enduring is seeing what the invisible God as though he were visible standing before him and after his endurance after he had endured the hard fight he inherited the promise now isn't it strange look like God could have just reached down and given the promise right then and done the work right then he could have done it Hannah when she was at the temple and she was praying an Eli came out and thought she was drunk and she said I am NOT drunk but I'm praying that God will take away my reproach he said the Lord God granted to thee thy request now God could have placed little Samuel right in Hannah's arms all of us know that he's a creator of all things just speaks it into existence he could have put it right in Hannah's arms but instead of doing that it was the regular procedure of nine months before the little baby come along he could have done it instantly but he didn't do it instantly he just gave her the promise and she inherited the promise when God told Moses when he started out to go into the Promised Land all that promise he said I give Abraham years ago it's all walled up with the Philistines and all kinds of great people over there warriors he said now it's all yours there was the am rights the hittites and the perizzites and all those over there in Hittites juveniles Philistines everything in Palestine now God said I've give it to you it's yours now go and possess it oh I hope you see it people it's something that I want to get to you to put faith where it belongs many people as I find they've got faith if the only knowed how to put it to work the only knowed how to put it to work and I love it brother Branham says in perfect faith is uh you don't know how much faith you got because faith is unconscious you don't know it's about putting it into action putting faith into action with the Word of God beyond once again beyond the feeling or the sensation and it's so often like let's continue on and that's the same thing the Holy Spirit is paragraph 63 if we'll just let it run its way and not us get in the way not us throw our doubts there cuz this didn't and that didn't just let God's Holy Spirit working and you rest upon the promise it'll do just exactly what God said it would abraham was an old man a hundred years old when God appeared to him in the name of Almighty God the Almighty there comes from the Hebrew word of al-sharia which means the bosom or breasts of a woman now he was old his strength was gone but el shaddai i is the almighty the strength giver and all abraham had to do to obtain this promise was lay right on that promise it's the same for us it's not in working it out or reasoning with it or trying to make it work or make it fit into our lives or trying to bring it to pass it's in laying right on that promise and holding on to it holding on to it that when the storms of doubts and life and winds assail us that we don't let go of that promise because it's ours it's mine it's mine doesn't matter if we see anything doesn't matter if we never see anything we hold on to it because we walk by faith and we walk by sight or we don't walk by sight we walk by faith not by sight after okay it's 65 paragraph 35 we'd and we'd do the same thing when we come to God and see his promise we just lay write to him and draw from his word the strength of God given in its course not taking our own mind just believing it just believing it after he had endured he obtained the promise oh I just love that now the same thing works for salvation same does for divine healing how God and His great love and infant mercy give it to us now saying surely I will bless thee and will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he endured the promise or he he received the promise that the term in der ER literally means suffer patiently suffer patiently yeah it's there's something to that I've been so I really like I like lifting weights cuz it's fun it makes you it says the glory of young men is their strength so I want to live up to that part of the scripture amen praise God can I get a witness and then amen and it's true and and there's there's nothing wrong with that but I've been changing up with my trainer lately we've done a been doing a lot more endurance stuff like just going at it like hardcore and I'm just pouring sweat it's so fun and it's so fun and I've been thinking about this a lot this this passage of and God like I found that definition quite a while ago of suffer patiently and we've been just changing things up and you know it's what's amazing is that you know stair climber nobody likes the stair climber you just get on that thing you're like climbing stairs when I first started doing it back at the beginning of the year I could do like five minutes maybe I was like I'm done this I'm just sick of this because I like to lift things it's easy to lift something heavy once or twice or 5-6 times but do that like a hundred times they're a thousand times in its lake that gets really tiring and I've managed to to get it up to like 30 minutes 30 40 minutes on the stair climber which is a lot of fun but it's it what's interesting is the mindset that it takes the mindset that it takes in the shift and I think often we take the Word of God and there's a place for that for strength in the sense of like I need to like real quick boom I got to do something and it happens and we got to do it right now but then there's the patiently suffering over a long period of time this church great example right we had no pastor for a long time that was patiently suffering we're just just waiting hanging on just hanging on to God and we all you know you have your ups and your downs but you keep enduring you keep enduring and it's funny because we had that happen some things that happen in churches don't bother us because we're like oh that's no problem it just you just don't it doesn't even bother you you don't even think about it you're like yeah that's easy it's no problem because you're just it's that that endurance has already been built it's the same thing someone who is an ultra-marathoner who's running a hundred miles like hey you want to run a 5k hahaha I already did this morning before you got up you know I mean that's that's their mindset that's their lifestyle but I was looking up the BBC was talking and was interviewing these um these ultra marathoners and these people who are on you know hundreds of miles there's absolutely insane distances there are moments when you feel very strong and you this is a quote from one of them you feel very strong and you feel like you can keep running forever he says and a couple of instances later you feel like I've got to stop this hurts so badly I can't make it to the street corner and then you push through that wall and you emerge in the other side and you feel strong again and it's the same thing with us in life it's the same thing with holding onto the promises of God we have those moments where we feel strong we feel on the rooftop we're just like I got the I got this no problem ten minutes later you could be like I'm about to die I'm literally going to die and it you know and it's those changes because we're leaning into the emotions we're leaning in it now it's fine to feel good and it's and sometimes even faith will bring about those emotions and that's good and that's fine but our sight goes beyond that beyond that layer you look at the outer court inner core holiest of Holies the outer Court is constantly what's the weather doing what is what's going on in life so-and-so said this I just smelled that from those cattle over there and you're just constantly in this waves of of stuff then you go into the inner court which is great you're eating this the showbread and you've got the you know you've got the the candlestick there but it gets smoky you gotta constantly maintain it constantly but then you get into the soul you get into this certainty where it's a constant glowing of the Word of God it's a constant glowing of the spirit there's nothing there's no anxiety there there's no one's certainty there's no confusion there there's no clouded judgment there it's certain it's certain praise the Lord first Corinthians 15:58 therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord praise the Lord amen endurance persistence perseverance proverbs 24:16 for our just man falleth seven times and rise it up again you're gonna make mistakes who cares really that if you're a believer a true and you know it if you're not and you're still wondering you got to make your calling in your election sure you gotta you need to get to an altar and be certain get to God get hold of God and be a hundred percent certain you're right with God and after that you come to God your will make mistakes and a you will bounce back because because it's the Spirit of God in you that you're relying on it's not your own actions your own works we all how many in here is perfect you made no mistakes I put my hand down that's not me make no mistakes ever not at all see we're all agree we're all agreed none of us are perfect except Jesus he came and he did it so we don't have to the reason we have the blood is so we can live under an umbrella of grace sovereign grace grace and may we have that same grace for ourselves and for others grace constant grace praise the Lord just man falls seven times and his his reliance is not in his own strength looking unto Jesus the author the finisher of our faith amen when you've done all you can do it seems strange back to that passage 59 be certain of God it seems strange when a person has done all that they can do that they have fulfilled every request that God has asked them to do and still he is silent when you've done all that God has requested you to do and he's still silent just be sure that you know God get that sorted out be certain of God and remember faith is silently waiting patiently suffering silently waiting he's only testing your faith to see what you'll do God does that it was the Hebrew children that believed God as stood out for God and they were sure that they were right with God and he let them walk right into the fiery furnace before he ever moved but stayed wait silently assured that everything's all right when you've done all that you can do when you've come through the prayer line and been prayed for your heart doesn't condemn you and you're living right with God just hold on to it God has to answer God has to answer determined holding hold Jacob wrestled with the angel and he held on to God held on to that word held on to it with all of his might determined if you turn loose the next morning say well I'm no better I guess there's nothing to it then you didn't have faith to begin with if you've got real faith you'll hold till the last breaths gone from your body you tilda I want to say that again if you've got real faith you'll hold till the last breaths gone from your body like take that and write it on your arm or something like right in on the fridge you'll hold till the last breaths gone from your body you're certain that God is God you're certain holding on to God then you would take his word for anything he said 54 he swore by himself that's the Word of God I believe every word of it it's 8 not it's ain't not for me to cut praise Lord not for me to cut this out and that out it's for me to live up to its qualification that's all until its requirements rather if I got to live up to that for God has swore he said he that will add anything to it or take anything out of it the same will be taken out is part of the book of life that's right so we believe it don't take out from the Word of God don't exclude yourself from the blessing of that promise that's taking out of the Word of God it's amazing how Satan will come and he's just rehashing the days of miracles are past same thing over and over again he'll use a different line of oh well you know that was for someone else or you know well yeah that would it would be for you if you did this or if you really prayed through like this he's always adding additional requirements or something like that you hold to God's Word certainly you do live up to the quirements if you've got something you need to deal with God will reveal it to you he will absolutely if you'll listen and pay attention to him that's right so we believe it if our foundation is firm and sure in Jesus Christ then brother there's nothing can shake you you're just you're anchored amen oh say all right and after that the 15th verse now and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise oh say I don't know whether we're going to get down to that say that seventh chapter or not um after he had patiently endured Amen he obtained the promise can you do the same thing this morning can you set your faith and say it's thus saith the Lord and no matter what comes or what goes weather today is easy tomorrow is hard the next day they're teasing you the next day their make your own mind your own mind not just others your own mind the next day they're making fun of you the next day they say I'm crazy I endure amen after not before he endured but after he endured he obtained the promise amen oh my there it is you see it brother that shakes all devils and everything else away see see there it is and Satan come say oh now I tell you you're just a little worked up he'll tell you it's so amazing no matter what he's always got an answer if you listen to him he'll tell you now when you've actually got a hold of it with faith he'll tell you you're just excited it was just an emotion anything he can do to get you back into this state of disbelief I remember one of the things that in my early must have been my teens there like it was one of my walks of faith to God was I dawned on me is like it's like I had a moment where I went I because I was like you know maybe all this is just to work up maybe not if it's real you know none of this like maybe God doesn't even exist it's like all of a sudden it dawned on me is like wow if God's not real why is there some force always trying to convince me that he's not why nothing's trying to convince me that he is in my own mind there's nothing that's like constantly like God has to be real do to do it here's why God's real like nothing isn't no but there's a force always opposing that always there's a reason for that if this exists this has to exist absolutely must absolutely must amen you're just a little worked up you just you just might as well be kind of reasonable about this thing say it's thus saith the Lord and you can say that because it's the word God said it I believe it that settles it no matter how hard it comes what it looks like what anybody says I want to with patients not fretting person can't have patience and fretting all the time you just got to set your sails right straight there and walk right on no matter what takes place move right on and I want to leave this with you guys this morning we've got needs we've got sister Keisha in the hospital she's not in the hospital she out she healed yes she is yes she is good no matter what happens you walk right on because Satan will try to come in right now and what he'll do is he'll say you guys really need to get with somebody in here sinan yeah it's you yeah you're the problem you're sinning that's the reason why she's not getting healed and if you got something to deal with deal with it you need to do that you're sinning you're bad dress oh man she's not getting better somebody needs to you know it's you you're not a good enough Christian nothing to do with that everything to do with waiting on God and if if the Lord chooses to take her home he will use that to try to say see none of it's true none of it's true none of its real none of it's true but you just walk right on with the Word of God it is up to God to fulfill his word and in the meantime we are holding on to his word that says God you ed asked you said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you said you're the God that heals all of our diseases and until until the last breath we're holding on tonight we're holding on to that and that's just it we are holding on to that how many agree with me this morning amen we're holding on to that for sister quiche and for everyone else and everything else it doesn't doesn't matter if we see it it doesn't matter you know brother man Oh talked about believing for your family and I'm roping in friends with that I doesn't matter if I see it I believe it I'm holding on to that that if I never see it in this life I never see it I know they'll be there because I believe it I'm holding on to that on the holding on to that and I'm certainly God brother branham even said he said in that same passage he said now I'm not saying they will but you just believe it and this whole Christian faith is built upon this thing of faith if people can go rub a rock somewhere and get healed how much more with the truth because they simply believed it it's the same thing with us that if we've got the truth but we're too busy parsing it out and fighting with it or fighting against it with our own minds are getting in this intellectual like college-educated age where which console like well let me check Google on that one like no just believe it jesus said jesus said when the girl when when gyruss his daughter died he said what did he say just believe only believe I love that don't do anything else but believe that's the only thing we're called to as Christians is to believe and walk forward believe trust that it's the same God it's the same I was reading the other day brother Branham said with Simeon Simeon was waiting for for Christ did told him and people laughed him to scorn God had told him you won't die until you see the Christ he was waiting in the temple he was waiting patiently in the temple and brother branham said if God made the promise it's up to God to show you it's up to God to show you it's up to God to bring it to pass so you just believe we don't get into a state of worry because Satan will come and he'll feel guys himself up as God and he'll caught just like job's friends you're a secret sinner you're a secret sinner that's why it's you're trying to bring about this condemnation trying to bring about anything to get your focus off of the Word of God anything to get your focus off of that word but if we can hold on to that steadfastly that no I'm not even going to look at that I'm not even going to see that God you know my heart I make mistakes yes maybe I've done some things that were wrong but God help me I'm holding on to your word that's it I have settled it I'm holding on to that word and that's it that settles it though he slay me I'll trust in him though I'm the last one standing I will trust I will trust I will hold on to that word I will hold on to that word amen I thought let's the musicians come up let's sing that song I'm resolved praise the Lord I will hasten to I am resolved it's Angie no longer to linger
