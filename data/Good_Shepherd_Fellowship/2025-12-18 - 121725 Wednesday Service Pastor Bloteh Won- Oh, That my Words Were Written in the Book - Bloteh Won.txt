We pray that the Lord will give you a special touch and and uh just rebuke that uh praise the Lord. The Lord bless you tonight. We'll take our Bibles. We'll read from Psalm chapter 22. We'll read from Psalm chapter 22. Read from Psalm chapter 22. A very familiar Psalm. That's what I wanted to open the service with tonight. But uh we just ask for the Lord to come and just take some few psalms and and then we come right into praying tonight. So I wanted to do that last week. Uh like I said, we were going to have short prayer meetings just before we go into the word. And just before I would come out, my stomach, oh my god, I don't know where that devil came from. My stomach was spinning me so bad last Wednesday. I almost I almost broke up into crying. I was going to ask for Dan. I say, "Hey, you just broke down. Go just pray and and whatever you can do, just pray and encourage the people and uh uh but then uh after he sang the tear song uh I said why we just prayed and go up there and when we came the Lord was able to touch us." Amen. Praise the Lord. I don't know what it was, but we are here. Praise the Lord. We are here tonight. Psalm chapter 22. Let's read. Uh uh my God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me? And far from and from the words of my roaming. Why are thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaming? Oh my God. I cried in the daytime, but thou heareth not, and in the night season, and I'm not silent, but but thou are holy. Oh, thou that inhabited the praises of Israel. Amen. Our fathers trusted in thee. They they trusted and thou did they deliver them. Praise the Lord. And we can trust him, too. and he will deliver us. Amen. They cry unto day and will deliver. So we can cry also and we can be delivered. They trusted in thee and were not confounded. And we can also trust and we will not be confounded. Amen. Praise the Lord. And David goes on here where he goes uh uh but I am a worm and no man a reproach of man and despise of the people. All they that see me laugh me to scone and uh they shoot out their lips. They shake their head. He trusted on the Lord but he that he will deliver him. Let him deliver him. Seeing he delighted in him. Praise the Lord. Now, so you see it if you read Psalm chapter 22, you will see that David is saying pretty much the same thing that Job said about the people around him, how they treated him. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you tonight, Lord. And we just ask that, Father God, make this evening special for us, oh God. Father, because we don't know when is going to be our last service. So God, father, we want to put our all Lord God that if there is not another one tomorrow, we will know that we have done our best. So we thank you for the strength and the grace that you have given to us. We just pray that you bless us in your presence now. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Praise the Lord. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Thank you for coming and uh and also thank you to everyone that is streaming into the service tonight. Praise the Lord. Amen. So tonight we just want to we want to cap off on our our subject that we pick up uh all that my words were written in the book. Oh that my words were written in the book. Praise the Lord. Oh that my words were written in the book. That's Job chapter 19. Let's turn there. Job chapter 19. And once again, I want to I want to labor tonight and see if I can if I can be able to bring out uh uh what what has been the inspiration around that. I know I tried to do that on uh on uh Sunday, but I will try once again. Job chapter Job chapter 19. And just like Psalm 22, we see Job here uh complaining in some way. Let's read from verse 18. Yeah. The young children despise me. I rose up and they shake and and and they speak against me. All my inward friends are hold me and and they whom I love are turned against me. My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh and I am escape with the skin of my teeth. Have pity upon me. Have pity upon me, oh ye my friends, for the hand of God have touched me. Why do ye persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my flesh? With everything you are seeing, you are not satis you are not satisfied. You are still probing and probing and saying things and guessing is very painful. It's very very painful. Praise the Lord. And yet he broke into this prophecy what we taking as a prophecy. Oh that my words were now written. Oh that they were printed in a book that that they were engraving with an iron pen and laid in the rock. not lay in a rock but lay in their rock. Praise the Lord. Amen. For I know that my redeemer liveth. See, see, see the transition. That's what I want us to see. He comes right here from complaining. The all of these people are treating me LIKE THIS. AND WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? OH, MY FRIENDS, Y'ALL HAVE MERCY ON ME. YOU I MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN SITTING DOWN HERE SEVEN DAYS looking at me like this. I mean, YOU HAVE NO MERCY. HAVE MERCY ON ME. HE'S SAYING ALL of this. Then he comes to this place like just taking a DEEP BREATH. ALL THAT MY words were written in the book, printed in the book, engraved and laying in the rock. AND AS SOON AS HE SAID THAT, ON THIS SIDE HE STREAM, I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVE. Praise the Lord. This man that was just complaining just now of pe of being treated. He took this pause. Oh, I wish my words were written. AND THEN ON THIS SIDE, HE'S BREAKING OUT INTO PROPHECY. HALLELUJAH. Oh man, I wish I was a preacher to really bring this to you. FOR I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER liveth and they and and that he shall stand at the later days upon THE EARTH. AND THOUGH AFTER THE SKIN WOUNDS destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold not another, though my reigns my my my reigns eye be consumed within me, but ye shall say, why persecute we him? Are we together? So, he's coming from out of trials right into prophecy. Praise the Lord. Amen. And that is the same thing with all of God's children, as you will see a little bit tonight, with all of God's children. Amen. Let's let's let's just take uh uh uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed tonight. We we just want to read a few things to you and just cap this whole thing up so uh it can it can kind of make sense. You will see where where we've been coming from with this talk. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. See what brother Brandham says. All those things type Christ. All the things that was in the Old Testament character type Christ. Just like it was Christ IN DAVID SAYING MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE THOU FORSAKEN ME? IT WAS CHRIST THAT WAS IN JOB SAYING ALL THAT MY WORDS WERE WRITTEN IN A BOOK. All those things type Christ. Praise the Lord. Amen. All those things tied him just a type. But but yet the mystery was hate. There was a mystery behind it. How can he come from seeing how people are treating him? even the children the words that they were using on him and then he will come right here breaking out into prophecy. I know my redeemer living. NOW WHAT WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU IS THAT WHERE DID HE get the strength from TO COME FROM A PLACE OF BEING despised to come from A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE using hurtful words on you AND THEN TO TURN RIGHT HERE AND SAYS I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVE. Where did he get the strength from? Praise the Lord. Amen. It was easy when the farm burned, when the children died, it was easy for Job TO SAY, "MAKE IT, I CAME, make it, I will return." BUT THE NEXT TIME when the devil came before the Lord, HE TOLD THE LORD SKIN FOR SKIN, let me touch him. DESTROYING EVERYTHING AROUND YOU, YOU CAN GET a a breath of fresh air, but let me touch him. Praise the Lord. Amen. LET THIS THING BECOME REAL WORD. uh uh uh uh I mean we go through different things but sometimes the most painful thing when you find yourself to to a place where you can't identify your strength knowing who you are KNOWING WHAT YOU COULD DO in certain situation and then you find yourself doing the contrary are we together amen so brother Brandham says all those things type name just a type. But yet the mystery was hid. Them men didn't know what they were doing. They did not know what they were doing. THEY WERE LIVING THEIR NATURAL LIFE. THINGS WAS HAPPENING TO THEM. BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WERE writing prophecy. THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE PROPHESYING. Are we together? &gt;&gt; They didn't know what they were doing. They only knew that they were led by the spirit to do some now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation. You know, God God kept it for us to understand it. That's the reason why we should complain but not too much because we have examples. Amen. We should cry but not too loud. If I said don't cry, I will be that would not be fair. But I would say cry but not too loud. Complain but don't be too wide. Amen. When you want complain, just go in the corner and complain. Don't do every word because you get you get bunch of examples. JOB NEVER HAD A BIBLE TO READ. HE NEVER HAD AN EXAMPLE, but we have an example. So, brother Brandham, IT SAYS GOD KEPT IT for this last day to reveal the mystery that were behind their lives. Are we together now? holding the back in the last for the great revelation but expressing it express himself in Moses in David in Joseph in Elijah we can say tonight in Job we can say in Sarah we can say in Ruth we can say in Naomi HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WERE AN EXPRESSION OF Christ are we together &gt;&gt; but we more he kept it for us expressing himself in Moses, David, Joseph, Elijah, and on down. We could take each one of those prophets and bring their life out and show and show it express Jesus Christ perfectly. So that's what I want us to see that Job is expressing Christ WHEN HE SAID ALL THAT MY words will be written in a book. Are we together? Amen. And like I was saying on Sunday, IT WAS NOT A LITERAL BOOK. GOD FOUND A MAN CALLED JOB THAT HE COULD WRITE HIS WORD, in his book, in his life. And every one of us, THE REASON WHY GOD PREDESTINATED US FOR THIS AGE IS FOR HIS WORD TO BE WRITTEN in our book. Amen. in our book. That's what I want us to see tonight. We take all of those prophets and bring their life out. Show it express Christ perfectly. Exactly. Never giving his secret in full. He never told them the secret. He never gave it to them before. Amen. Waiting for to make it known in the last days as he has promised. waiting for it to be fully comprehended. See, before he could express it, if he told the whole thing, are we together? So all of those Old Testament, but but it was all about Christ, but he healed himself. They thought they were going through their problem. They thought they were going through and that is the same thing that we ourself don't leave God out of your problem. Amen. You have to know that he said I will be with you. I WILL NEVER leave you. There is nothing in the word that say if you get sick I will leave you. Praise the Lord. He never SAID I WILL BE WITH YOU UNTIL YOU FALL THEN I WILL LEAVE YOU. I will BE WITH YOU UNTIL YOU I MEAN UH UH YOU YOU GET TRIAL THEN I WILL LEAVE YOU. HE NEVER SAID THAT. He says, "I will BE WITH YOU EVEN UNTO THE END." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So when WHEN WHEN TRIALS AND TROUBLE COME, THE FIRST PERSON WE HAVE TO BE LOOKING FOR IS WHERE IS HE? BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE THE ENEMY OVERWHELM US. WE GET SO WHY ME? OH, SEE EVERYBODY. AND THEN YOU ARE NOT EVEN SEEING THE ONE THAT IS THERE. He's he's HE'S TRYING TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION. GET YOURSELF QUICKLY. This is not this is not a public show for you to get in the STREET AND BE COMPLAINING AND YELLING. LET EVERYBODY KNOW YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT GET TROUBLE. People get worse trouble than you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Look that this this is the thing that is making the message sweet. &gt;&gt; This revelation to know that Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. HE'S WITH US IN OUR WEAKNESS, IN OUR TROUBLE. IT MAKES THE WORD PUT ON FLESH. &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT THING BECOME REAL TO YOU, THAT'S WHEN THE WORD IS MADE FLESH. when you can go be going through thing and you can't understand it but you know that he said he will never leave me he will never forsake ME &gt;&gt; SO I KNOW I'M COMING OUT OF this &gt;&gt; no matter how how it turned I know I'm coming out Satan I know I'm coming out you are a liar oh man it makes the word sweet but when you are just complaining and just uh you know uh uh you know I mean it just it make faith a sour thing. faith becomes so sour. Labra says the birds will say what kind of god those people are serving the those human beings they complain too much. The birds THEY DON'T THEY DON'T FARM THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING. THEY WAKE UP in the morning they just start SINGING SONGS PRAISING GODICK quick and then they look down upon us say oh look at those humans. I wonder is the god that make us that make them. They are too sad. You love the Lord. Let's go a little bit further now. See what he says here. Victory day. Look at Job when he was fighting so hard. Even his wife, his companion said, praise the Lord, his wife, his companion said, even her birth was has become strange to me. Now his birth has become strange to her. Amen. So forth. What a time that man had that man had the temptation. Belad and all the rest of them. Elohoo even tried to accuse him and things like that. But he know he did stay with the word. Amen. One thing Job would say over and over, his int his integrity. He was not willing to drag it in the in THE DUST. NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY, WHAT I BECOME, praise the Lord. What I become is a strong think. It's a very very strong thing. This these were Job church members. THESE WERE PEOPLE THAT JOB taught the word of God TO THESE CHILDREN THAT WERE DESPISING. YOU READ IN THE BIBLE, THE BIBLE SAYS HE WENT IN THE MARKETPLACES and people would stop him and say, "Job, I have a problem. Please give me an advice. All the children will come running around him." But now these very children, their parents has been talking in the house. Why? Well, why? You know what? He went out of the word of God and I mean they've been talking. So now the children believe their parents, the attitude of the children is the thoughts of the parents. Are we together? Brother Bram said he was fighting so hard. See what he says here. He says even his wife and his wife come and said, "Job, you look too miserable, sir. Why don't you just curse God and die?" He says, "Thou speakest like a foolish woman." OH MY, WHAT A HERO. Praise the Lord. He was not looking like our heroes today. Amen. He was NOT LOOKING LIKE BROTHER SAYS WHAT A HERO. A PERSON IS AN HERO WHEN you can hold to your faith in the face of death. Not when YOU GET HEALED, YOU are a hero. It's when you are in pain AND YOU ARE DYING AND YOU STILL HOLD TO YOUR FAITH. That's the hero. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh, what a hero. He said even Jesus referred to him have have not yet heard the patient of Job. He said Job went down in the highness. Means he went down fighting. He went down fighting. MY ESCAPE WILL NOT BE THE escape of the skin of my teeth. I will fight. I will die fighting. AMEN. I WILL DIE WITH MY FIGHTING BOOTS ON MY FEET. I'm not going to take off my bullets and lay my shield down and put everything down and just lay down and say, "Death come and take me." No, he went down in the hardness. Praise the Lord. He said, "Abraham went down in the hardness." Yes. Isaac went down. Joseph went down. Don't bury me down here. Bury me up here. Bury me up here with my fathers. Bury me in the way they were buried. The word. Amen. The plan they were buried in, the place where they were buried. That is the same thing with me. Now he's showing that all OF THESE MEN, ALL OF THESE MEN NOT UNDERSTANDING EVERYTHING THAT WAS HAPPENING TO THEM, THE LITTLE THAT THEY HAD, THE LITTLE THING THAT WAS REAL to them, they heard it even on their dying bed. Praise the Lord. Amen. ABRAHAM COMES AND HE COMPLAINING. GENESIS CHAPTER 15, OH GOD, I'M GETTING OLD. YEAH, ELIZA, YEAH, HE CAN BE MY SON. God said, "Forget about it." Abraham, not Eliza. I say your son. You will have a son with Sarah. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. EVERY TIME HE WAS GETTING WEAK, GOD COMES IN AND COMFORT HIM. And the COMFORT OF THE LORD IS OUR STRENGTH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So all of God's people, they go down in the hardness. They go down hole in their faith fighting. THEY JUST DON'T SURRENDER. Are we to get Are we together? Amen. Hallelujah. Listen to what he will say also here in spiritual adoption. And here a point that I want to drive home. Now this the this was all my quotes that I got mixed up on Sunday. So I just thought to read them to you tonight and then we prayed and go home. This is my my point. Uh he said here I want to drive home. May the Holy Spirit take it to every heart of you believers. Just because you are a believer certainly you you you have everlasting life. Amen. God says so. But will you want to will you want to just get in as Job said by the skin of your teeth? You have certainly you have everlasting life. Certainly you are safe. But the thing about it there is that it does not exclude you from fighting. THERE WILL ALWAYS be a situation that will rise up for you to fight. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING THAT WILL RISE UP CHALLENGING IN YOUR IN YOUR MIND, CHALLENGING IN YOUR FAITH, challenging in your family for you to rise up and fight &gt;&gt; because we are not in a picnic. We are in on a battlefield. Amen. Praise the Lord. We just don't rise up and eat and play. No, we are on the battlefield. So he says uh will you just want to you just want to get in as Job said by the skin of your teeth. Will you just want to come before God come before the father and the talent that he gave gave every one of you as being negligent and you just didn't use it or you let something else stand in your way. Praise the Lord. Are we together? Because somebody's challenged you and you don't have the answer. So you just BACK DOWN AND YOU START DISBELIEVING YOURSELF. YOU START DISBELIEVING the word. Is that how you want to get in just by the mercy of God? Are we together? Neglect. He says the talent that God gave you and use it or let something else stand in the way. You let you let little petty things that means nothing to you. After all little fusses and strolls and argument and church differences take the meekness and the gentleness from your life. You find people do that. They allow other people mistakes to become a stomach black today. THEY THROW THEIR virtue away because a preacher backslide. What does that have to do with you? Or if that man that was that was that was preaching the message, IF THAT MAN that was following God, if if he can, what what does that have to do with you? WHY ARE YOU UH DESPISING THE GRACE OF GOD IN YOUR life because of another man's weakness or another man's failure? Praise the Lord. If he fall, we jump over him and we move on. If he wants to get up, we help him up. If we say get up, he don't want TO GET UP, WE JUMP over him and we move on. all the little fusses. Brother Brandham says the church differences take the meekness and the gentleness from your life. You allow other people to stumble you. Praise the Lord. And sometimes we do that. We make other people our excuses. Well, even they said they don't come on time. We just go to that church early for nothing. It's not for nothing. Brother Bam says you supposed to be here to open the service. You supposed to be here to be praying. So you don't measure yourself with other people and what they are doing. Will you want to stand before the father like that? I don't believe you would. I don't believe that you will do it. Neither will I. How I want him to say it was well done. Amen. No matter what I'm doing, let him says it was well done. At least you try. Amen. Get a little pat on the back and say, "Son, you trying. You will not measure up to the to the great man that did great things, but you try." The measure that was given to you. You try the LITTLE GROUP THAT ARE PUT IN YOUR HANDS. YOU TRY THE PLACE YOU FIND YOURSELF among God's people. You try. You try with the family I gave you. You try with the resources that I gave you. Are we together? Not by the skin of of my teeth, but it is well done. my good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of the Lord. Amen. For you did well with what you have to do. Listen to what he says here. Now, I took this one and just put it in. Maybe you are a housewife. If you are, God made you a teacher to your children. Do a good job out of it. Regardless of what you have to do, do it well. Do it well and be and be proud of yourself. Praise the Lord. Do it well. If you just want to come and be sit, just want to come and sit in church, just sit well. Don't sleep. Is that all you want to do? Just just make sure you do it well. Praise the Lord. Are we together? Listen to this one. Like I said, I just reading my notes from Sunday to you. Possessing all the gates. A few years later, when the trial comes, I love this one. This was the one I was looking for on Sunday because it was tying right into what I was saying. All the church got all shook up. as it's so easy for a congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way that it should that is supposed to be. God makes it that way. God bring tension into the church. If he can bring if he can allow tension to come into the church, he can also allow tension to come in your home. He if he can allow tension to come in your home, then he can allow it in your neighborhood and he can allow it at your work. But what he's watching your attitude are we together. He's watching your attitude. How are you going to handle it? See what he says here. And and and God makes it that way. Lord bring tension in the church for for every son that cometh to God must be tried and proven and tested. Now this is what I was using on Sunday. I I'll come back to it. Must be tried, proven, and tested. He let sickness tracks you. He let disease come upon you to test you and and to prove you to show the word that you are truly a seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. How how will he SHOW THE WORD? HOW WILL HE use sickness to show the world that you are a seed of Abraham? HOW WILL SICKNESS show the world that you are see is your attitude with the sickness. How you are dealing with it. Not buying people sympathy. But even in your sickness, your confession is right. Praise the Lord &gt;&gt; that even the people THAT COME TO COMFORT YOU, YOU ARE THE ONE COMFORTING THEM &gt;&gt; IN YOUR SICKNESS, YOU ARE THE ONE STRENGTHENING THEM. THAT'S HOW THE WORLD WILL will be able to glorify him to show the world that you are truly a seed of Abraham. He permits it by his own will. He permit disasters. He permit friends to turn against you. He permit all these things and turn the devil loose to tempt you. And he will do ALL BUT TAKE YOUR LIFE. He could throw you on the bed of affliction. He could turn YOUR NEIGHBOR. IS THAT NOT what was happening to Job? That's exactly what was happening to Job BECAUSE IT WAS GOD THAT TURNED HIM OVER TO THE DEVIL. AND ALL HIS NEIGHBORS TURNED AGAINST HIM. ALL HIS FRIENDS TURN IT. THE ENTIRE CHURCH TURNED AGAINST HIM. And God allowed it. What is our attitude? Praise the Lord. What is our attitude? We quit church. We look for the next one. We look for the next place where we will be accepted. Praise the Lord. Everybody in that church is a hypocrite. That's the first thing we say. Everybody in that church is a hypocrite. They are all hypocrites. They just only look at you from the eyes, their mind, their heart. That's we just we just talk carelessly. I believe the preacher goes back to the father and says he she never grabbed it yet. Oh, he stayed he he's he's too he's too much of a child. He didn't grab what you were doing. Praise the Lord. And we start saying all sorts of things. That other one what what he who he think he is. That other person who she think she is. And we just go on and on and on and on and on all because we are feeling sorry for ourself. We are feeling sorry for ourself. When people do things to you and then you have the grace to feel like you are you are you are older than that thing. When they do things to you and you feel like it's too it's too little. That one is too little. I've I've grown past that and your attitude to them. You are not responding to them the way they treated you, it make them confused. Praise the Lord. Are we together? He permit all these things turn the devil loose and and to tempt you and he and and and he would do everything but take your life. He could throw the you on a bed of affluction. That's what he did to Job. He turned his neighbor against him. He he could turn the church against you. That's what he did to Job. These job friends, they were all IN HIS CHURCH. OH, THEY SAID JOB, THIS IS THE WAY you taught us that these things can only happen when a person commits sin. They find their opportunity now to rebuke the pastor. Praise the Lord. ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT WHILE THEY WERE DOING THAT, WHILE GOD WAS ALLOWING THAT, he was writing his word in a book, taking the treatment of the people, the attitude of Job, all of those things were the ink that he was missing, mixing together. He was writing his word on the heart of Job. Pray that soon he will break into a vision and he will say I know my redeemer lady. I know my redeemer lady. Sometimes those those uh tough things we go through. The ones we will go through we feel guilty. The ones we will go through we feel that we we we WE WE HAVE FAILED GOD. SOME OF THOSE things right IN THOSE THINGS RIGHT on that bed of affliction. You can stay right on that bed and say this very same word. I know my redeemer will know I will come out of this. Praise the Lord. Amen. AND EVERY TIME WE TAKE THAT POSITIVE POSITIVE ATTITUDE, God just write something on the tables of our heart. He turned the church against him against you. He can do most anything and is God's will for him to do it. We are taught that it is more precious than gold to us. When he take us through those things. Praise the Lord. When he take us through those things, when people are thinking and and whatever they are saying and what attitude is to you, you must be thinking what God is thinking about me in this situation. IF YOUR MIND EVER GOES TO THAT, YOUR attitude will be right. You'll be saying, "Lord, give me grace. Let me not fail you this time. Help me, Lord. Let me not say the wrong thing. Change my heart, oh God. PRAISE THE LORD. CHANGE MY MIND. That's that's where the Christian faith, that's where Christian life is. Right in the midst of that, you say, "God, change my mind. Let me not think evil about them." It's tough. They are saying ugly things about you, but yet you want to be positive about them. All that my words were written in the book. I love it. The whole the whole week I just been I just been saying these things to myself like some kind of crazy man. Amen. All that my words were written in the book. I just I just love it. Praise the Lord. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful thing. What a wonderful thing. See what brother Brandon will say yet again. Let's Let's take Let's take another one. Message of grace. Message of grace. Okay, I'm left a few minutes here. When I think of Abraham, all the mistakes that he made and Moses his mistakes. But when Abraham commentary was written, when his divine commentary were written, when Paul wrote Abraham commentary, he never mentioned one thing about Abraham unbelief. No, no, he never even accounted to him. He said, "Abraham struggle not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong giving praise to God." My humble prayer is before the before the grace of God that is here this morning or tonight, I hope my I hope mine rose like that that he won't see my mistakes. That's when my commentary is written. Amen. my obituary that it won't be read out that I made mistakes and done wrong, but he will only see the things that I tried to do for him. Praise the Lord. Amen. IT'S NOT THAT PAUL NEVER knew uh uh the mistakes of Abraham or the mistakes of King or Abel or the mistakes of all of the men that he pulled in Hebrew chapter 11. But the Holy Spirit compared him to leave out their mistakes. Why? Because what Paul was writing was was the information that was in the lamb book of life. ALL THEIR MISTAKES WAS THEIR BOOK OF LIFE. BUT WHEN THE INFORMATION IS TRANSFERRED FROM THE BOOK OF LIFE TO THE LAMB BOOK OF LIFE, it is completely different. You read you read your own information. You don't even want to believe it because you know yourself. Praise the Lord. You don't want to believe it. You think that they are talking about somebody else but they are talking about you. Oh, that my words were written. They were printed in the book. Praise the Lord. Every year we live on earth is like a page in a book. Every year, one page. If you are 35 years old, your book have 35 pages. Praise the Lord. If you are 60 years old, your book have 60 pages. Every time you have a birthday when you say h sing my birthday song happy birthday told you how oh are you you passing the page praise the Lord sometimes it's good to go back and read what was on last year page what did I do what I need to do all that my words were written in the book. God had complained. He says in my life I made mistakes that brother Brandham praise the Lord. This is his own words. I never alter it. I have done lot of things that's wrong. I probably will. I probably if I live much longer I will do many things many more perhaps some of them will be stoming blocks in your way this is brother Brandon speaking realizing that he's a human realizing that he he's he's in a 16 element body his gift was the angel of God to us that gift was the angel of God to lead us but yet the man was in assisting element body he's telling you I made lot of mistakes and even some of my mistake will be a stomach block and that's what making people to stumble perhaps some will be a stomach block in your way I hope that you will forgive me I was reading Abraham how that the frustration he had mind the things that he did. He doubted God. He lied about his wife in everything. But when his divine commentary was written, Romans chapter 4, it never mentioned his mistakes. But it says Abraham never sterled at uh at the unbel unbelief through God, but was strong. Amen. All his mistakes, all his mistakes was all forgiving about when the divine commentary of his life was written. His frustration wasn't mentioned. his mistakes wasn't mentioned. Brethren, I hope that when my commentary is read that day, that he will rub my out too. And one thing about them, I hope you do, too. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, you see, it brings us to the place to have a better understanding of the book of life. and the Lamb book of life. We must be reading from the lamb book of life because that's where the seals were. The information that were hidden under the seals were in the lamb book OF LIFE. THEY WERE NOT IN THE LAMB. They were not in the book of life. It was under the under the lamb's blood. THAT'S HOW WE MUST BE LOOKING OUR LIFE THROUGH THE GRACE OF GOD THAT HAVE COME ONTO US. THE THINGS THAT GOD IS DOING IN our life and how he's helping us. Are we together? Praise the Lord. When and and that's that's when when people try to use their kind of mind to understand the things of God and they get frustrated with God concerning their life. He made you Why will you be frustrated with him? All you have to do, Lord, I don't understand this thing. Lord, help me. I don't understand why I keep coming around the cycle or why this thing is happening. Give me grace to help me. Praise the Lord. Paul did the SAME THING. HE CRIED, "GOD, I PRAY FOR THIS MAN. I RAISED THE MAN THAT FELL DOWN BACK TO LIFE. I LORD AND HERE IS MY EYES. MY EYES IS BOTHERING ME. MY EYES IS HURTING ME. It's painful. I never HAD THIS EYES PROBLEM. BUT THE DAY YOU MET ME ON THE ROAD OF DAMASCUS, THAT'S WHERE MY PROBLEM BEGAN. LORD, WHY YOU GAVE ME THIS PROBLEM? AFTER PAUL CRIED AND CRIED AND CRIED and cried, then God make him to understand. I have given you such a grace to understand the word of God. Praise the Lord. If this thing was not in your life, you will exalt yourself beyond measure. This thing is given to you to keep you down every time you want to go. Praise the Lord. Every time you want, YOU KNOW, I'M THE CHIEFEST OF APOSTLE GOD. WHEN PAUL UNDERSTOOD IT, HE SAID, "YOUR GRACE IS SUFFICIENT." JUST LIKE JOB SAYS, "MY REDEEMER LIVETH." JO PAUL SAID, "YOUR GRACE IS SUFFICIENT. YOUR STRENGTH IS MADE PERFECT IN MY WEAKNESS. HE could see in THE LAMB BOOK OF LIFE. HE SAW HIS NAME IN THE LAMB book of life. Praise the Lord. AMEN. WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD GRACE IS DOING IN YOUR LIFE, YOU HAVE SEEN your name in the lamb book of life. Not trying to work out self-righteousness. And you are just trying to work out self-righteousness THAT YOU ARE NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS OF YOUR WEAKNESS THAT God want to use. HE WANT TO USE YOUR WEAKNESS. YOU ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING OUT of self-righteousness. See what brother Brandham said that we read this one and we close. Invisible union. That's where that's that's where the meat is tonight. Amen. Praise the Lord. You just been eating fish and crab. This is where the meat is. Praise the Lord. I hope your teeth will be able to handle it. He says, "Now your old book is gone with your old union. Your old union with the devil. Your old union when you were not saved. Your old book is gone with that old union. Your book of life is gone with that old union. Are we together? See what he says now. Now your name in your old in your old book has been transferred. Your name has been transferred. YOU SEE SCIENCE HAS GOT US TO the place I have a printer in in my office there. If I I I can print something from my iPad here and it will print out in the in the office. is transferred to the printer but you don't see when it went. That's the SAME WAY WHEN GOD TRANSFER YOUR INFORMATION FROM YOUR OLD BOOK TO THE LAMB BOOK OF LIFE. YOU DON'T SEE IT. &gt;&gt; So you KEEP READING FROM THE OLD BOOK WHEN THE INFORMATION IS ALREADY TRANSFERRED TO THE TO THE LAMP BOOK OF LIFE. PEOPLE, come on people. WE CAN DO BETTER WITH THIS MESSAGE. WE CAN DO BETTER WITH OUR CHRISTIAN LIFE. Self-righteousness is making us to live a selfish Christian life BECAUSE WE'RE JUST LIVING ON A self-pity and we just want it for ourelves. Oh God, help me. Oh, I need the Holy Ghost. Oh, oh, God help me. Fill me with the fill me with the holy. When will you be filled SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY DONE WHEN HE WANT YOU TO BE BUSTING OUT OUT OF YOUR BELLY SUPPOSED TO BE COMING LIVING LIVING RIVERS OF LIVING WATER. WELL, OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE TOUCHED BY YOUR life at your job and AND AND AND PEOPLE AROUND YOU. When you're feeling sorry for yourself, that's self-righteousness and God don't like it. It's uncleanness in the eyes of God. Praise the Lord. Filthiness. Listen to what he says. Your name in your old has been transferred. Oh, you see, do you mean to tell me that my old book, God put it in the seed? Oh my God. Oh my God. Amen. Praise the Lord. You want to tell me MY OLD BOOK, GOD PUT IT IN THE seed of his forgetfulness? &gt;&gt; So he's not even READING FROM YOUR BOOK OF LIFE. HE'S READING FROM YOUR LAMB BOOK OF LIFE. Praise the Lord. He put it in a SEED OF FORGETFULNESS. SOME OF US, WE HAVE BECOME SUPER DIVERS. We we are diving. We're looking for LIFE JACKET. LIFE JACKET WILL KEEP YOU UP. THE BOOK IS DOWN. Praise the Lord. Going to look FOR OUR PAST. MAYBE IT'S THAT THING THAT I DID. THAT'S WHY GOD IS NOT BLESSING ME. AND THEN YOU JUMP INSIDE and see. Praise the Lord. YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IT. YOU COME OUT. LORD, help me please. Oh my god. Oh my god. And as you ask God to help you, he bring you OR YOU GO BACK THERE AGAIN. OH, MERCIFUL. You know, I I just when I when I study these things, I just enjoy it. I enjoy it because it makes our walk with Christ sweeter. It gets sweeter as the day goes by. It gets sweeter. Christ become a person. IT'S NOT A RELIGION. IT'S NOT A CHURCH HOUSE. He become A PERSON. YOU FEEL THE PRESENCE OF THE ONE THAT SAID, "I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU. I will never forsake you." You feel his presence. It's not some sensation that just g your body. No, you feel it RIGHT IN YOUR MISTAKE. You can feel it because you see grace is standing before you and that grace tell you, you know, you just mess up now. You say, "Lord, yes, I mess up. Have mercy upon me." Give me grace. It's been transparent. DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT he put my old book put God put it in the seat of forgetfulness? You stand perfectly before God. Now your name is now in the new book. Not in the book of life, but the lamb book of life. Praise the Lord. Your name is in the lamb book of life. YOUR NAME IS UNDER THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. Praise the Lord. Amen. IT'S UNDER THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. I WANT TO BE MORE OF JESUS. I WANT TO BE JESUS FOR MY DAY. Praise the Lord. AMEN. WHEN I LOOK AT THE LIFE OF OF MOSES, I LOOK AT THE LIFE OF DANIEL, SHEDRA, MISHAD, AND ABEDNEGO, I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE SHEDRA, MISHAD, AND ABEDNEGO. I want to be like the Christ that was in it because it's transfer on this side. Praise the Lord. The lamb book of what the lamb redeemed what the lamb has redeemed. The lamb book of life. What the lamb redeemed. Not the old book of your natural union. Not the old book of your natural union. When did that natural union begin? The day you were born. DAVID SAID, "I WAS BORN IN SIN." IN SIN DID MY MOTHER CONCEIVE ME. SO THE DAY THAT YOU WERE BORN, YOU WERE MARRIED TO YOUR OLD BOOK. FROM THAT DAY, THAT'S YOUR natural union. BUT THE DAY THAT YOU RECEIVED CHRIST, THE DAY YOU WERE ASKED, DID YOU ACCEPT THE LORD JESUS AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR? ARE YOU READY TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH HIM IN WATER BAPTIZE YOU IN the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? That old husband is dead. PRAISE THE LORD. THAT OLD BOOK STAY IN THE WATER AND IT GOES DOWN TO THE BOTTOM. Don't go swimming for it. It's gone. You try to swim, you will not even get it. Praise the Lord. Because it's in the sea of forgetfulness at the bottomless PIT. IT'S BOTTOMLESS. YOU CAN'T you can't find it. It's gone. It's gone. Are we together? WHAT A LAMB REDEEMED. NOT THE OLD BOOK OF YOUR NATURAL UNION. But you you are new bride. Hallelujah. Your your new life is in the book in the lamb book of life. Your marriage certificate is the revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. Your marriage certificate is the revelation of Jesus Christ in the lamb book of life. That's the reason why we can't identify oursel with bride because we keep reading from the old book. There is no MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE. THE MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE IN THAT OLD book is the one married to the devil by your by your first birth. But when YOU COME TO START READING YOUR LIFE, BY GRACE I'M SAVED THROUGH FAITH. AND IT'S NOT BY MY WORKS, BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD. Brother Brandon said he slipped the ring of a merited favor on your finger. He gave you a marriage certificate, the revelation of Jesus Christ. beginning to see things new. The message is not just water baptism in Jesus name. A woman don't wear trousers. All of those things the Pentecostals can do it better than you or we believe in the oneness. Jesus is God. Wonderful. They all wonderful. But it's all of those things. They are all there in the old book. When you come to the new book, it's completely different. Amen. When you come to THE NEW BOOK THAT DAY, YOU WILL KNOW that I was in him. Amen. He was in me. I in you and you in me. When you look in the new book, you see yourself part of the deity. When you look in the NEW BOOK, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ONENESS, YOU DON'T LEAVE YOURSELF OUT. If you leave yourself out, it's just knowledge. &gt;&gt; Oh man, I'm I'm fire. It looks like preaching on the convention tonight. Amen. That little prayer meeting did well for me. It looks like I'm preaching in the convention tonight. I let you go here. Now, the old book of your natural life, but you are a bride. Hallelujah. Your new life is in the lamb book of life. your marriage certificate where your true internal gene from the beginning takes hold. It takes hold. Praise the Lord. You grab it. No matter what your mind goes through, no matter what your body goes through, your mind might be failing you, but you get a hold of it. You know that you grab it. YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW. And that's what was happening to Job. He got a hold of it. He couldn't explain it, but he said, "I know my redeemer liveth." Are we together? Now you are not only forgiven, but you are justified. Glory. Justified. Romans 5:1 said, "Therefore, being justified by faith in God's book of the seed of forgetfulness, your old book, your old book and in marriage is divorced and dead and is is not even in the memory of God. Your old book and marriage is divorced and dead." That's what God that's what the prophet God says. That's what brother Abraham SAID WHEN WHEN PAUL TAUGHT IN IN IN in Romans chapter 7 that a woman cannot marry until her husband is dead. Brother said that was not about marriage and divorce. He said we use it on the subject of marriage and divorce. He said but Paul was prophesying. He was prophesying to the church that you cannot get a hold of your husband Christ until your old husband is dead. Until he's dead to you. This Christ will not YOU WILL REALLY NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM. If you are still falling back to your old nature, your old mistakes, you are still feeling condemned. You cannot fall in love with Christ. YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT HE LOVE BEYOND ALL YOUR faults and he still love you. While you were we were yet in sin, love us, man. Falling in love with Jesus is the best thing I have ever done. Praise the Lord. I mean falling in love with Jesus. Waking up in the morning and say, "Lord, I love you. Thank you for another day.

I love you, Jesus. I love you, Jesus." If you are not in the habit of doing it, you better start doing it. Praise the Lord.
