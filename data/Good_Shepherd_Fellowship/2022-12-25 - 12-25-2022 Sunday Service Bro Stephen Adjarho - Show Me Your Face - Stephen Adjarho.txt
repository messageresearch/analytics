morning [Music] foreign [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Applause] all the time [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] just for a moment praise be to God God bless you all Saints and um happy to see every one of you um it's been a very cold blastering winter morning and um I honestly was not expecting to see many of us this morning but praise be to God God bless you all for coming and I urge you to be in great expectation because I was talking to brother jarrow when I picked him up from the airport that night actually they canceled um don't take my word for it but I believe I saw 5 000 flights and um that day we were expecting two people uh one from New Jersey and of course brother jarrow and then the one from New Jersey called and said the flight is canceled so we were just wondering what was going to happen so when brother jaro came in and were talking you know when he got to he had to rebook his flight um when they got to New Hampshire I believe it was uh he said he was the last person to enter the plane and when he entered then they took off and I believe that he is here on a Divine Mission he is here on a Divine course things like this don't just happen just for the fun of it I mean everything that happened the easiest thing that could have happened for us to receive a call oh the flight is canceled and we would all understand but praise be to God he made a way for his servant and it's for a good cause just open your hearts and ready to receive from the Lord it's not a man a lot of the times we come expecting to hear from the man and it is the reason a lot of the times we get offended because even when God is talking to you you just hear the voice of a man and you get offended but when you walk in here knowing in your heart that you are coming to hear from God it doesn't matter what comes from the man's mouth you just hear nothing by the voice of God praise be to God Merry Christmas to everyone of you and it's just amazing how how how early not how Elevate All Too Soon the year has come to an end I tell people at work that in Africa where I come from we have 24 months in a year but here in America we have six months in a year and I was saying it and uh my manager told me that you know what I heard that also from somebody a Chinese and the Chinese lady said actually they have four months in China in a year because she said she was a banker and when you spend more than one minute on a I don't know how true it is if you spend more than one minute on a customer if you're not lucky to fire you 30 seconds you are done 30 seconds you are done that is how fast we are running life is in the first Lane and before you are where the year has come to an end and things you plan to do you never did them and that is how the devil steals our attention and before you away you are even 60 years and you don't know how you got there praise the Lord and things you should have done yesterday are still staring at you in the face we have gotten so close to the end never lose sight of it 2022 very soon would be history it will never come again it tells you how close we are to the end God has sent his servant here for a cause this morning I don't know what he has on his on it but certainly certainly there is something for every one of us here this morning and just receive from the Lord praise be to God shall we just stand on our feet just say a word of Prayer and we can get him in I have two prayer requests here before I forget one from sis Bria there is a brother in Kenya by the name brother Isaac whose brother had an accident and is currently in the hospital and also a prayer request from brother Ben uh for sis his sister-in-law who is also admitted to the hospital and currently undergoing some tests praise be to God shall we burden our heads as we go before the Lord [Music] our Lord and our Master Jesus we thank this so much oh God [Music] that Against All Odds you have gathered us before the intern of Grace this morning that we may hear from you the easiest thing we could have done this morning is just recline in our beds and probably follow the service online because it's really cold and the roads are

little gospel was singing I was behind the one whose report should we believe for your report says that we are free your report says that we are redeemed your report says that we are healed your

the way we came if we have fought with our wives we are going to go home to continue from where we stopped a lot if we fought with our neighbors we're going to go back and continue from where we stopped and Lord if we are oh God be deceiving ourselves we're going to go back and continue from where we stopped [Music] but Lord if we have come this morning to receive the greatest gift salvation

Lord we pray you help us this morning [Music] that your God we grant us Lord mercy and Grace [Music] Lord me may we be privileged Lord to break into your presence [Music] like I said when Moses said let me turn aside and see this great sight Lord may that be the portion of each and every one of us this morning from the great to the smallest that we may turn our side to see that great sight foreign Grace to see a bush that is caught on fire and yet is not burnt a loyal little did Moses know that you were showing him I'm gonna consume you but yet you're not going to be burnt Allah we pray May the god cause him in fire come upon our lives this morning if for nothing Lord may we not just oh God come to your words may we not come with Excellency of speech but Lord find entrance our heart Lord this morning meet us wherever oh God we are at may we be able to come just the way we are may we not look at the next man it doesn't matter oh god what the next man think about our business Allah may we be able to come just the way we are may we will be able to approach that throne of grace for you say we have an eye priest that can be touched this morning by the feelings of our life that it is he said therefore let us come unto that throne of grace that we may obtain Mercy in time of need Lord we are in a needy hour we are the needy people this morning Lord we want to come boldly to obtain Mercy several requests has gone up before you Lord not not because of us not because of one's special prayer by brother so and so or minister so and so but Lord because of your mercy look down from heaven Lord and see the need of those breading that we read on the altar not because one special person prayed but Lord just as the word declared the Cry of Israel went up unto God and God remember his promise to Abraham no Christ have gone up before you this morning look down in your mercy and remember your promise we have nothing to offer we don't even have a prayer life to offer we don't even have a past time to offer but Lord oh we can offer this morning Lord is that you promise and you keep your promises [Music] bless the services oh God in South Africa Lord bless the services

the Lord shall we sit there this morning amen amen [Music] amen we are kind of unofficial today so we'll put up with one another amen and look like the the weather has worked on us so don't worry because we are not uh we are not going for some convention in the white house so we don't have to be formal or do things so superficial so they can be put in the mic while we are sitting down just don't worry about it let that be my trouble amen when I was coming out I I thought of it I said okay everything has changed now bro Steve I said well I have to depend on this mic so I will just have to stand in one place and I thought that was going to be the case but unfortunately uh it changed I've been doctored upon now amen we're going to find out how this all works amen so we are thankful to be in the house of God this morning my prayer is that God we we really visit us that's my prayer this morning that God visit each and every one of us if for nothing the the bad Road and the the white Christmas like people pray for now they have it and everybody's in their house amen so if for nothing that God will will meet with us that's my prayer when brother one called me about two three weeks ago and he said I want you to come to Minnesota for the Christmas period I said I said okay I didn't think I didn't even think it I said okay and then after I have said that I started thinking of it my cousin in Indonesia called and said he was coming with his wife and his two kids and I've not seen him since 2012. and I said now things are beginning to fall in place in the way I don't want them so after the service my my pastor told me said I want you to speak on Sunday and on Christmas period I said well but I want already told me to come down there Christmas period so I'm not going to be around during that Christmas period I gave him my word but I will be in service on that's the last Sunday and everything started unfolding in a different way last Sunday because my cousin told me he was coming and he sent me his flight itinerary in my mind it was coming on Saturday we're on the 17th but in reality he was coming on the 18th you know at times he could be living in your mind this world is not in your mind there's reality and there's your mind you know so in my mind it was coming on the 17th but in reality it was coming on the 18th so I was working with my mind not reality because I didn't have time to look at the itinerary to see that it will be arriving 8 am on Sunday and by 8 am I should be preparing to go to church and I've given the past of my words I'll be in church and I'll speak and so on Friday I called him up I said uh okay uh how are things going this everything is doing or going all right we're going to be flying we'll be in Dubai and then we'll call you and then say we'll be arriving on Sunday I said maybe I didn't hear what he said clearly I said what did he say we'll be arriving on Sunday I say yes yes Sunday and then I thought of it what did they just say Sunday and then I looked at the itinerary he says it's only 8 am in the morning and then the Mind battle began and I'm worried I said I've not seen this person for 12 since 2012. now he's coming to the United States with his family uh and they're going to be at the airport by 8 AM and it's impossible for my house to they flew into a different airport Dulles in DC I'm gonna have to drive three to four hours to go pick them up I see there is no way under the heavens for me to drive from DC even if I have to drive on Saturday night and pick them up to drive from DC and drive to church it's gonna be all messed up I'm not going to really be organized to be inappropriate so I said okay and suggestion begin to come to my mind I said just call the pastor and tell him you're not going to be able to speak and you should get some other person and and and things will just go all right and you can just go and pick them up then I thought of that I said okay uh that was kind of almost leaning towards that angle because I believe coming to the presence of God we have to really prepare to get out of the way so God can speak to people so in all reality we're actually Servants of God we're like tools in the box at the the mechanic it just picks out the two that he needs and used to work on the car that's actually where we are so when we come into God's presence when we come in here the struggle is to get out of the way so God can reach the people the subway is not the clothes you put on or the kind of English word you're gonna all those things doesn't really matter you could even fall dead on the platform and they pick you and you go go just like that I'm going to come to something on that that line and so I was thinking of that I said okay the best thing I'll just do my wife and my mom can be driving to church why I'll just drive to the airport and pick them up that thought begin to to come and then there was like a battle I said this is kind of sacrilegious you know how can I just just dump the service and then be going to the airport and now I'm thinking how can I just let them arrive at the airport and be going to church now I'm in between both and I told my wife I said uh well now we have a situation here I said to go and pick these people I said well I'm just going to drive there I said I don't trust you on the steering wheel to go because if she has to go she has to leave the home like about 3 A.M in the morning I said I don't trust you to that point she said I've driven I said no I just don't I just want my heart to be at peace knowing that they are around that I don't trust you driving 3am in the morning and be heading towards DC I don't trust that he said so what are we going to do I said we're going to pray God will give a solution and I'm praying and this battle is still going on in my mind I said I said this is really the devil and then somebody came again and said there's a minister that I usually visit us in the church somebody say just go to church and tell the pastor that Buddha should speak for you and then you can just drive to DC I said well that sounds like a good idea and uh to be candid that brother was in church that day see the way everything works out at times he came to church that day so it'll just be easy for me to say important Edwards can you speak the passenger can you speak I'm running to the airport and everything would have just been all right in my own mind not in the real world like I told you there's a real world and there's your mind so you don't want to live in your mind because in your mind you are the one that is doing everything right every other person is wrong in fact bro Steve is a hypocrite bro ability hypocrite everybody you are the right brother you are do you are perfect when you sang that special that's how God wanted it twin sister Kelly sang it she didn't use the right tone so Angels didn't clap for her so but you in your world everything is just Prophet that that's how there's something that didn't sing it well I mean if you are stood on the piano you would have shown brother area that this is how God wanted it or if you've been an usher it would have been everybody would have seen that God has given this church and Usher we've been playing since with the ocean we have but God has good that's in your mind but in the real world things are really different so it will be good most of the time if you can leave our mind and come to the real world because it's a real world and there's your mind and the world does not evolve in your mind there is no Galaxy in your mind it's just blood and veins and artery that's what exists in your in your heart there so nothing there so we want to come out of your mind and actually come to the real world in the real world everybody is not the saint even the Saints also make mistake that we will almost say they are not sent that's in the real world but in your mind yeah you're working on coals of fire you're mashing the devil's head and everything is just going smooth and when you pray God answer and when you when you lay hard it is your prayer always when they prayed and that brother and care that had an accident when God healed him it was your prayer godhead not when because God knew you were holding all night yesterday so God know you'll be building up you'll be doing some spiritual uh lift you've been in the gym spiritually you know what I'm saying and so when you prayed everybody was praying but when you just say oh Lord answer that prayer God just healed the brother so when there's a testimony tomorrow about the brother being healed it was your prayer you know and you have to come and testify that how you prayed and when you fed that energy you know the the spirit of God came on you and you pray that all those happen in your mind but you have to come out of your mind there's a real world yes in their real world none of that happened if God does anything it will be his mercy and his grace it's not going to be according to your mind it's going to be according to his mercy and his grace and so while all of that was going on and and I'm thinking of that I just it's just beginning to get me really worried and then I begin to realize what Steve how little things can get you disorganized and worried and so I got upstairs I'm cleaning the vista's room my wife went to work I'm preparing the visitors room and I'm still worried I'm still not I'm still not come to the conclusion what is going to happen and I'm cleaning the room all morning I'm getting really tired and I relaxed a little and I prayed I said Lord I'm really confused at this point see I just want to come just the way I am I'm confused at this point I don't really know how to approach this thing at this point I don't want this person to be upset just coming to the United States staying at the airport with two little kids and the weather the temperature has already dropped like you know so them coming they're coming from a tropical country Indonesia and now they're coming to about almost 20 20 degrees before it dropped below zero so I'm kind of thinking I said my mom I don't know what my mom is thinking because my mom that is that my cousin was adopted by my mom that's my mom's younger sister before she passed away and he started Living with us so he's very close to my mom I said how my mom feel we are going to church and if she knows that they are at the airport so all these things are coming in my mind and I'm thinking and I said let me just keep praying and I just kept praying and praying and all of a sudden it just clicked on me get them a hotel and let them go into them when they're flying they should take a shuttle go to the hotel and stay there when you're done preaching you can drive to go pick them up and when you click I just felt peace and I told my wife I said I think I got the solution I think I think the Lord just lays something in my heart now we're going to get a hotel for them they will go to the hotel and you say that sounds like a good idea I say yeah that's what we're going to do and about 3 A.M in the morning I woke up 3 A.M I was calling hotels in DC I couldn't get out of the front desk so I called and booked a hotel finally and I couldn't get a hotel for them because they were flying at 8 am in the morning you're gonna know I'm telling you all these stories because it's going to blend to why I'm also here we'll try to take a trail like what Abraham said the trail of the serpents so we're following this Trail yeah because Brian said this happened at the beginning is the same serpent at the end so you got to follow his Trail so so I got the hotel uh and I was still not Resolute in my mind so I called the front desk again in the morning at about seven a.m I called and they said okay we got the room all set and the guy was so rude he was I think that was the most uh the most terrible customer service I ever had and it was like getting rid of the get trying to get rid of me like like okay okay I said okay okay okay okay uh uh we got the room yeah yeah yeah we got we got it you need anything more I say oh no no we're fine because I could feel the negative energy coming from him that could just spill into an argument and a bad discourse I said okay we're done and then I realized that I didn't get no confirmation on my my phone that the room was booked so I called back again I said that what email did you use oh I used the right email I said I said I just want you to read the email that you used because I didn't get the text message uh I didn't get no confirmation that the room was booked and I had to deal with that negative energy again and it was just so rough I said oh Lord be merciful and when he was done he read the email I said the email is wrong it's missing one letter he said okay okay okay okay and he got a letter and he said we don't I said I said I said my and we got off the phone I said I just want to make sure this room is booked so I waited for a while I said probably in the afternoon this guy should be out of the front desk there should be some other person there that I can talk to to confirm so I called again in the afternoon a lady picked up the phone that lady was nice and then she said yeah the room was booked I said okay they're flying in at about eight eight a.m in the morning and I don't know how long it's going to take them to to get off Customs so I want the room to be extended because they said if you don't show up by 7 A.M the morning is going to be no show so I said is there a way you can make it like 10 a.m so they can come in she said yes they put a note on there so that kind of settled my mind and I was no more worried about it and I just prayed and so I didn't really have time to really uh uh study uh for the service but I prayed for the service and and and I realized that most of the time what we really need to do is to pray for the service we study we don't study for service we study we study to know more of God we feed ourselves on the world but when it comes to service we just pray for the service because we don't know what God is going to say but we keep feeding on the world we keep listening to tape reading the scripture that's what you do every day but when we come into church what the subject is going to be I don't know so but I'm am I prepared yes I'm prepared how prepared I am I'm so prepared not to say anything to make sure I really get out of the way to allow God fetch the mind of the people because there's a regard look Church there is a living God if science has broken into uh the the realm of human mind until they can invent a device called a liar detector that can be able to detect the vibration in a man to tell that that man is lying have much more for you and I to know there is a living God it's a living God and I pray God this morning that that is what you and I will be able to take a trip and break into where that Living God is because that's what Christmas is all about Christmas is all about Christmas tree and argument of people bringing quotes where brother Brown said he has Christmas tree or bringing quote why you have Christmas light in your house I don't have time for those things if you want to argue on those things keep on arguing I am looking for where God is hiding amen because that's where I want to hide because the world is boiling and and it's getting to the point it's going to blow up so it is becoming so obvious to me that I have to find where God is at and it's not as easy as it was two thousand years ago crowd was following him you could see him as a man it was not it's not easy as that now it's not a man that you can just look for but he has become a spirit living in people so I have to find where he's at and identify with him because the world is falling apart it is obvious to me men a lot of force we left Africa and we came to America we left Africa not because Africa was was bad bad but it was economically bad that's why we left it was economically bad and there was no social rule of law was kind of weak they have laws but it was weak it only worked for some good some great people and don't work for song Amen there's no country in Africa that don't have all the laws you have here in America but it just worked for some people and doesn't work for some amen amen if you steal a bread they can cut off your hand and somebody can steal millions of dollars and they will sing special number for that person it's just how it works you can be caught stealing a a piece of uh meat in the market and they can beat you up and sleep you naked and probably even throw tires on you and set you Ablaze on fire and somebody will steal trillions of dollars and they will sing special number for that person that person will even come to the house of God and give you testimony of how God bless him this is the reality so while we left there we didn't leave Africa and came here because we were coming to Heaven if that is why you came you have been deceived because you can realize now that you are not in heaven we left there because of the economic uh situation and the the disconnection that we have with what we are seeing in other world but here we are now we can eat good food after we've done some of us we stop in the buffet and we can after eating the buffet you can take some picture and send it to a Liberia Nigeria to show them that you are the guy you know you have arrived you you are no more their mate you are no more in their class you can so you can put it on Facebook Tick Tock and all the all the things that the devil has brought under heaven so that you can show the people that look I'm no more in your category I have been uplifted God has blessed me you you can show them all of that but here we are now when we begin to devote our life to the Living God they will begin to realize that there is another message yes we begin to realize that there is another mess here we begin to send our kids to school and we begin to send our kids to school and we are going to our job and then we begin to see laws that begin to make us uncomfortable begin to see the president of the United States a few years back that same man Joseph Biden he would say with his own lips that what is the game what kind of game is going on here that every state to respect uh uh uh uh the the law of marriage he said marriage is between man and a woman I can show you the video I can show you of four or three interviews that he had he said what is the game say what game is going on so at that point in time Joseph Biden realized that there was a game going on in America that what is the push for why are you pushing that marriage should be twisted for man and woman to become woman a woman a woman a dog or whatever you can even get married to a stick or whatever Oh serious this is no fun somebody got married to a train station in Europe this is serious this is no joke they show you that the world is going crazy and somebody got married to a dog and how far can we push this and now if you are not spiritual it doesn't really matter to us it doesn't matter it's just we should not let's not argue too much with them after all we are not the one marrying men let's not push it too much let's just leave let's just live Let's Love It's All About Love so we begin to realize that's if you are spiritual you begin to realize that we're in a teaching point you are no more what you thought was Comfort it's no more comfort you begin to look more narrow you are no more looking in a broad perspective I say all is well you begin to realize that all is not well you begin to see the the scenario of Sodom and you begin to realize that destruction is coming you begin to become obvious to you you could smell it right that man has gotten to the point that he wants to destroy himself and people are clapping on the 12th of December the president signed into law what he called Marriage Act so pretty much redefining marriage and force it on every state in America must obey that law that's what he said and that's what he said and when he said it everybody said yay they were all happy myself and Danny were watching the watching it yesterday and he said to to present Equity decency I said what is so decent with the mama and a man that's not a decent there but you see in his own mind like we just said there's the real world and there is your mind and but Abraham will tell us as Paul we also won he said because they did not retain God in their heart God will give them over towards their minds they will go into strong delusion now everything that they are doing will be in their mind everything will be okay in their mind because their minds are being said with hot iron oh yeah amen and so I got to the I got to the end of the day I told my wife I said okay I'm going to have to stay in the resource rooms like I really try to spend some time and pray because I realized my whole day has been a shred so let me spend some time and just try to get all the pieces together and bring it to God and see what God we have for the Sunday service I went to the church I made the pastor we shook hand and I sat down and the pastor called me and then we had a good time in the Lord and my wife was like oh wow I how how the message was so powerful but you didn't really have time it's not whether you have time it's whether God have time and that's what Abraham said we have to master human ability when we understand what this is all about it's not about brother Stephen coming to bring one great message that's not what this is all about it could have been a tip that you press play it could have been but an airplane a song it could have been sister Kelly singing a special it could have been any of the body but iron just hitting the drum it could have been sister Fatu singing you know special it could have been brought Steve singing especially I could have been since it could have been anybody because God is not but Andrew God is not bro Steve but in bro Steve's mind like oh this this is God that's your mind please come out of your mind and come to the real world I pray God help us to begin to think in that way so you can learn to appreciate one another because in your mind it is you but when you come to the real world God is in his people it's not you it's in his people but Abraham said the only physical body God has now it's not brother Steve even though there are many brothers still here this morning it's not bro bill need that brother it is his people and if God the only physical body God has now if it's his people how much more we supposed to respect one another see many of us don't have revelation we don't have Revelation what we call Revelation is just your mind you are living in your mind the evidence of it is what your life is producing right right because what you're calling Revelation is just your mind oh because I believe brother Brown is a prophet that doesn't make you a stick he doesn't make a Christian you can even sow a garment without a brown Spiller fire picture he doesn't even make it nothing but see this is where so many have uncalled himself I'm a Believer you can even read quote you carry 200 quotes my computer can bring more code that you can bring and yet my computer is not a believer why do you think you are a Believer because you can record my computer can bring before you can think before you can say Jack Robinson my computer and your computer the message search it can bring all the quotes on one subject before you can even blink your eyes and yeah that computer is not a Christian right then why do you think you're a Christian but the brand picture is on that computer you also put a brand picture in your house that computer is not a Believer why do you think you are a believer you see we have to narrow it down oh I think only belief only believe also can be sung on the radio and the radio is not a Believer why do you think you are a Believer because you sang only believe they always stand on the radio they read it's not a Believer why do you think you're a believer you see brother when we come into that fair many of our arrogancy withdraw and the true freshness of Christianity what God really want to do in your life will begin to come out the real thing God wants to do in your life will begin to come out because we have to Humble ourselves we have we we if for anything we need to be humbled we need to come to God just as we are but we are not suppose we are praying we haven't given God quote we'll try not to preach the message to God [Music] instead of coming the way you are you have you you have almost you you are even fighting with your wife if you die this woman you know in your heart that you're joining towards God it's a question mark you know it and yet you are nearly that God is 70 page five what are you talking about oh we believe the message we must believe that what what what are you talking about can you please explain what you mean by we as a believer when in your heart it takes 10 men to grab you not to make the wrong decision if you fly loose this all this old building can can go in flames and you can see it quote after that to show why you said the beauty of Fire in case you don't know okay never worship the devil in case we don't know kid never worship the devil he never worshiped the devil he was a gentleman that came to church and he he was so concerned with he won the presence of God to look beautiful but he did not care about character he didn't care about the character but all he care about is to put flower the puppet has to be my Sonia would the cross have to be he cares so much about those little little my new things but he did not care that his anger can make him kill a brother I didn't care about that he didn't care that when he's angry anything around him is dangerous because he becomes a tool he can kill somebody with it and when God begin to tell him what he did not care about God said came if you if you do what is right I will accept you I'm not into a gimmick of a favor right I don't choose favorites if you do what is right you'll be accepted he said okay sin is lying at your door did you listen no the fairy God he claimed to to come to worship he was not listening to that God and before we know it his finger begin to clean and before you know it the first time human blood will go down on Earth it was not done by a demon he was done by a message believer hey welcome you you say bro is that true you if you read your Bible you know that the first time human blood will be spilled on Earth it was not a man worshiping devil that killed another man it was two men worshiping the same God but the only difference was that one had revelation [Applause] where that Revelation and if you have Revelation it will affect your life so this might have Revelation the Revelation that we have affects his life so much until he decided that the blood of the Lamb should take his place it means so much to him that man's life has been messed up so something must die for me I can't stand before a holy God something has to die for me but can he didn't see the revelation of when you are coming to God death has to be involved all he saw is the beauty I'm going to have to put on some good looking clothes my shoes have to be in my hair I saw some sister would stay in the mirror for hours they stay in the mirror for hours walking on the head that's not their hair I'm just saying working on something that's not even yours you're taking time and doing it left and doing it right and spraying some you Just Praise somebody or something that's not yours we don't have problems it's not yours already we know that but just come to church you look beautiful to your husband so come to church why do you why are you spending time or something that does not belong to you you spend money to buy that dinner you are wasting all your time all your energy making it this way make it now it's not your own so what why are you wasting time on something that is not yours until it's even affecting your relationship with God okay before you know it you already have been calling with your husband who are you trying to impress who are you trying to impress I thought you're supposed to look beautiful to your husband and your husband's supposed to look handsome to you but you look at the the reverse is the case who are you doing spending time between God care about that Brazilian wig you're putting on God does not care about it God doesn't care about that that he doesn't care about it in case you don't know let me tell you this morning God does not care about your Brazilian wig don't go home say bro see me just pour my day today because that's not even my message amen you're spending time on things that that they have time to spend for your creator your online browsing all kind of weave on and you are spending time there and you spending time until you no more I have time for your kids you never have time for the scriptures you know all the Brazilians without and you know all the names and you never know the books in the scriptures and you think this is a joke this morning what I'm saying this money is not funny this is a serious thing that is going on with us we enjoy when we come here oh Baptists they are not going to have hey man we are enjoying we probably we are not yet to entertain ourselves pop is Antichrist praise God California is going to sick when they sink will that make me holy what does the sinking of California Got to Do With My Soul what is he going to do California we sing praise God praise the message you think that's the message that is the Judgment that will come on California judgment that will come in California it's not a message what gives you Joy when you hear the word but Abraham said the greatest thing that can give you my joy is when he hear his name called when God's word call your name is it doesn't call Stephen area no he said God revealed to you that you are in that room you begin to see your character you begin to see why you repented you know see why you ask your wife for forgiveness let me not see why you apologize because I said that is me Hallelujah the world begin to call your name I should begin to see why you are doing the things you're supposed to do you begin the word of God is calling your name and so I picked up I got done preaching and uh drove to the airport go to the hotel picture of my cousin and I was driving home I just began to reflect on what just happened last Sunday I said the devil really was trying to relate the message he was trying to disorganize me so I can be on the way and God can be hindered but brother Brown said unbelief cannot hinder the presence of God and so we spoke dealing with me on for the past few months and coming to Minneapolis I didn't come here with a message I will tell you that but I came here to fellowship with you and I pray God give us a fellowship that will make us appreciate the true meaning of God becoming flesh let us rise this morning we may have to sing a song it's about we're gonna we're gonna rise and we're going to pray first dear father Lord we thank you for your grace Lord we thank you for your mercy I pray Lord you bless us at your children this morning may your word Lord fall into the tables of our hearts change the atmosphere Lord be real to us father that's our heart desire [Music] show us what it truly means to have a relationship with you it's not complicated Lord you pay the price for it to happen just oh God open our eyes to see it just take humility we just have to Humble ourselves and Lord May that door of entrance be open unto us this morning [Music] bless your word as it will be read bless the congregation this morning take me out of the way speak to your people in Jesus name of prayer Thanksgiving let's be seated I'm going to sing a song that will read the scriptures [Music] and so the scenario begin to look like last Sunday what I won was trying to get a flight ticket he couldn't get he couldn't get a flight ticket that was uh reasonable the flight ticket was about like in a thousands I said oh my the devil doesn't want me to come [Music] and I said we just keep praying as I told Brother one I said don't worry I'll just get her I I want my cousin to be around the world so I'll get a rental car so my mom my wife we cannot drive down so on Wednesday we are still having that plan of coming down together so my mom doesn't like traveling uh long distance along this side took about 20 hours drive she does it like that so I convinced her I said we can't we are all going to mean so that you're not going to be at home by yourself so it'll be good you you join along with us you say okay everybody was in agreement Thursday we started hearing about the weather advisory it looked like the weather was not good Colorado Wisconsin Kansas we're wreckage all around the place and so I said well uh you all are no more going I will come just with my cousin he and I can drive down because I just wanted him and his wife to be around where the word of God is being preached and that's the plan during his visit that's what I have in mind for him and his wife and while they're around they can uh they can get to attend church with us and get to fellowship with the Saints and so we had all that planned and then I I started getting worried about driving now I'm hearing all about the weather advisory I said how will I be driving into the storm when I know that it's there I mean it doesn't it doesn't make sense all right that's why I said now I'm going to tell my cousin that it's not going how is it going to feel so I said well I'm just going to pray about it and I pray that I said well because of the weather I'm going to fly and uh would not be able to drive and so I tried to get a ticket the ticket was just too expensive and so I tried another route which is close to my office it's like two hours away from my house a Richmond so I got a ticket that was quite uh reasonable and I said well I have to drive two hours to to be able to fly out of that airport it did everything begin to fall in place slowly until after seeing cancellation of flight and there but the one called me I was driving to the airport the wind was just so intense I never seen it like that before usually when I drive like most of us drive we use one hand is that right because you are very good you know unto you you get uh you go into a car wreck you know people that don't know how to drive they don't get into career because they don't drive and it's people that know how to drive that get into correct because they know how to drive you know until they use one finger to be touching the steering wheel and then they bang it or somebody then they realize that oh snap I didn't mean to do that so but this time in many years I have to hold the steering wheel with both hands because the wind was just sweeping my vehicle left and right and my vehicle is heavy on the ground so I knew something was not right when I got close to the tunnel I saw the sea was roaring the sea was just so angry I'm like this is really terrible so when I was getting close to the airport with a lot of trees I couldn't feel the the wind no more I said Thank You Lord and I got to the airport the flight was supposed to be about 6 15 and we got to the airport this is 6 48. and one thing after the order and then but I want we called me and we're talking on the phone he said kind of what he was looking at it depends on what the weather is going to be there may not be service I said well I'm already on my way so if I if I get there there may not be a lot of people say if it's only two people because brother must get you to pick me up if is only brother and his family would get to fellowship with I'll be on the plane tomorrow and be flying back to Virginia it wouldn't matter at all because Luke church is becoming more real Fellowship is not numbers it's becoming more real Fellowship is not numbers Fellowship is between you and your wife if you're not married it's between you and another sister our another brother it could be on the phone you could see that and you just talk about God oh talk about your needs confess your fought one to another pray for one another and the prayer of faith shall save the sea [Music] he didn't know what I was looking at it the devil was like well you should have been home now you left your family it's Christmas your cousin is in the house I said I just prayed about it and I got to the airport they said everybody going to Minneapolis we have to rebook their flight I said now it's getting real and the flight time is changing and changing and I went to the front desk and lady said you may be able to catch a flight but in case you don't catch a flight you may have to stay at the hotel and fly on Saturday morning I said no I don't think I want to do that then I thought of it I said well I use the military term for this I would buy the bullet that means I will I will take the risk I said I will buy the bullet and then I didn't reschedule my flight I went to sit down I said the worst come to the worst I'm still going to be here yeah this is a shotgun visit tomorrow morning I'm flying back to Virginia and then we got into the flight I that when we're getting close to Cincinnati it was obvious to me my flight was already burning it was obvious because I was looking at it I didn't get no text message that the flight the schedule changed in Cincinnati the flight schedules to stay true and so many people in the plane we were really crushing you know people they can't hold themselves oh they cursing the heavens and causing the Earth because their flights were canceled and the person sitting next to me was ready kind of G train oh man and he's already grumbling because he was going to stay he was going to stay at the hotel until on Sunday until today so it was bad for so many people and I just said in my mind as soon as the flight hit the deck I would run into the the next gate so that's when I see in the deck I'm waiting and people are slow and I'm looking I said this flight is gonna It's Gonna Leave and this boarding I'm looking at no text message saying the flight schedule was changed and people are slow I just realized myself I said God Just Have Your Way and then I got out of the flight I started running to the the gate I got to the gate I see the gator stage I said my this is strange I didn't get no text message saying the gate change and so around to the the the gate they told me that the flight was going to uh the departing from there was nobody there at all I was the last man to enter the flight when I got into the flight I said praise God [Music] and then it began to be so clear to me that God has something to say to somebody [Music] when brother said they will not be serviced uh Saturday it didn't bug me I said because already I fellowship with Danny he and already have Fellowship and uh [Music] Amen in uh and God's way according to Wise Men When when when when you see me and these two young boys when we are fellowshipping you think I'm talking to some old men and they they flow they really flow so I call them my two wise men and so I said if this is all I can Fellowship I'm it's good for me to I can fly back it's unfortunate I cannot visit the brethren last time I came I couldn't visit some some of the president's home you're visiting your home means a whole lot I lived here for four years before I was transferred to Virginia so you may not value yourself but you mean a whole lot in my heart because I know you're a Christian in your struggle many of us have various struggle I still know you're a Christian with your struggle and that Fellowship means a whole lot to me your face means a whole lot he may not mean the whole lot to you because you're spending time looking at some silly Hollywood magazine and thinking your chick has fell down and and you don't look pretty it doesn't matter but there's something about a child of God seeing a child of God I don't know how the devil may have reduced you to yourself and make you look of no word at all but I want to tell you this money you mean something to God and every child of God desire to spend some time with you do your job may not allow that but a little minute or the little seconds believer sit with you and just chat it's a blessing Heaven Rejoice to say that happens I wish we can have that very often one of these days the time brother will be caught up we will not have to work no more you will not have to worry about all the sins and the mistake and all these things the devil is choosing to chase you left and right you will not have to worry about them no more all of those will be dropped behind and you will cross into God's mercy and so I believe God is going to speak to us you know that song show me your face Moses too on the mountain waiting for you to pass by you place your hands over his face [Laughter] in your presence he wouldn't die [Music] all Israel yes all the glory and his son and true age now you've called me to bully seek your face show me your face long oh show me your face [Music] then get up my legs that I must stand in this holy place oh show me your face Lord your power and your dreams and I will make it to the end foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] in this holy place oh hey man show me your face oh your power and your grace [Music] I will make it [Music] oh Lord if I could just see your face is that your testimony this morning oh Lord please show me your face oh Lord oh show me your face oh and get off my legs let that understand in this holy Place hallelujah amen show me your face foreign [Music] Hallelujah if I could just see your face [Music] [Music] holy place amen show me your face let's rise up this morning oh lord your power and your grace first I will make it to the end oh Lord if I could just see your face [Music] yes Lord amen show me your face oh and get off my legs oh that I mistake in this holy place [Music] your power and your grace only us and I will make it to the end if I could just see your face Hallelujah [Music] oh Lord and get off my legs stand in this holy place [Music] your power and your grace and I will make it to the end foreign [Music] this morning God bless you bless the musicians and bless the church let's just turn to as to those 38 don't worry I know you may be thinking oh we're going to have a long service we're going to close very soon amen we I think we already have the service maybe we just read the Bible and we see what God will say we can go home and eat the chicken and we can light the candle on the cake and celebrate the birthday of Jesus if Jesus was born today at all amen amen praise be to His holy name let's turn to Exodus 38 I'm going to read uh two scriptures we're going to read Exodus 38 and we're going to read Psalm 91. Exodus 38 and Psalm 91 we're not going to do a lot of reading I'm going to be quoting a lot of the scriptures but we're just going to take this to reading Exodus 38 and uh he said I besieged Thee show me thy Glory now Psalm 91 verse 1 reads like this he that dwelleth in the sacred place of the most high shall abide under the shadows of the almighty may the Lord have bless you into the reading of his word shall be seated today the world I chose today to celebrate what they call the birthday of Jesus Christ and which uh we're privileged by the grace of God to know that Jesus was not born today and even if he was born today there is nothing spectacular about celebrating a day because Jesus did not come for you to celebrate day weeks month it didn't come for that it came just from one purpose to reconnect you with your creator that's it so if you're going to celebrate anything at all is to celebrate a relationship with God that's it that's all it came for it didn't came it didn't come for you to be rich or for you to be poor it didn't come for you to look good it didn't come for you to even have a wife in case you don't know that so if you have wife give God praise and if you don't have also give me praise yeah yeah let's say Amen to that those that have those that don't have it didn't come for any of those things but all those things are benefits that also goes with which is coming but he came for one thing to connect you back to your creator that's why Christ came he came to connect you back to your creator and that's what we're going to look at this morning so we can wrap this gift there's a gift uh before us this morning we're going to try by the grace of God you and I we're going to try and focus as we take one rap after the other and see the greatest gift that God can give to the man that greatest gift is not a vape a cigarette that's not it yeah because for the smoker they thought that that was the greatest invention because we're no more smoking and lighting Matchstick and doing this now we just have something you can put all kind of flavor on it strawberry flavor and devil flavor and you flavor yourself to to your grave amen so we we we're not looking at that you may think that's the greatest invention of science but but it's it's not what we're talking about we're going to trust God help us this money to unwrap the greatest gift that can ever be given to humankind and so we start back our journey beginning Genesis because we want to see why this world looks so cursed this world that we're living in today why does it look so cursed we're going to go back to Genesis there are many values that have been lost through the true time as time goes on people begin to lose values they begin to lose values and we are right in the position we are in today values have been lost and so we think this Society has always been it has not always been like this at one time the whole world knew that it was God at one time the whole world knew the one true God at one time the whole world knew that the whole world knew the one true God and that's why I told you in Genesis chapter 4 Cain and Abel worshiped the same God it was not different God Cain was not worshiping Lucifer even even though he came from that line he was still the understanding was to worship the true Living God so Cain and Abel worshiped the true Living God the only difference in their worship was how they came one came spiritually one came physically so the same thing happened in the church this morning we have all come into the house of God there is seek Cain and Abel worship in one of the Christmas messages brother Brown preached he titled why it has to be Shepherd and brother Brown was saying that message but Abraham said any worship that is without Revelation is Cain worship right but the brother said anything you do with that Revelation is sin and so sin is not just fighting and and smoking and killing a committing adultery all those are fruits that sin produces sin is unbelief when you disbelieve God then your life would produce all those things so Cain and Abel they worship the one and true Living God now before Cain and Abel we we know the Genesis account how Genesis 1 we we unfold the story if you find out Moses did not say in the beginning God created Pluto Mass Jupiter Venus Moses did not go into all of those mess that people are trying to dive into today Moses went right straight into the message and what they said in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth the message Moses passed right there is that in the beginning God created so Moses passed a message that everything you're going to see from this point or came from God so Moses in his message established a Creator that's the first thing you need it didn't go into eschatology trying to teach you grammar he went into who God is in the beginning God that the emphasis is God and creation comes from him say in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and Moses went on and the kid will tell us the frosting he created the second thing he created and how creation begin to unfold slowly Moses begin to show us some people call it the 10 commandment of creation Let There Be ladies ten times God will say that and God was unfolding something and finally God said it was good and everything he was creating was good in God's side and then when he came to mind said was very good now this is very good if you go to verse 26 down to 32 God said very good this man that God would say it was very good was not this man it was not this animal man we are looking at today it is a spirit man but God later on we wrap this Spirit man in an animal skin in the package or a gift wrap a vehicle which you call flesh God will allow that man to be in an animal scheme but this man was in the image of God but now God wants to give this man a domain of his own this man have to be away from God he has to be in his own domain you cannot have two King ruling one Kingdom it's not possible so now God will now project this man and put him in flesh form so he can control this old Earth so Genesis 1 will tell us that God gave my dominion over all the Earth and every living thing that's upon the face of the earth now take note of that word every living thing that is on Earth man was giving Dominion now you can give somebody Dominion it's up to him if he uses it yes it's up to him if he uses it but you can give him Dominion now in the in the in the military you can be so you can be so carried away with your faith you can so recognize your faith as a Christian until people will begin to take you for granted and then you will have to use what we call the military voice maybe you're telling somebody say I needed to I needed to do that and and it's looking at you who's talking they said I needed to do that and it's like and it's it's going about his own business and then you change the tone that's the direct order I needed to do that now a lawful order violation of a lawful order goes a long way now you can choose to go in simple language say oh you don't want to do it okay I'm going to go do it myself you can choose to do that but you can also choose to change the tone of your voice and say that's a love order a lawful order is a love order you have to follow it regardless of who you are you may not like the face of the person saying it it doesn't matter you don't look at the face you look at the order right right if it's lawful you follow it and this is what Dominion is all about so man has been giving dominion and most of the time Believers let me come to believe us I'm going to come back to my message Believers allow themselves to be bitten by the devil and they give command the devil looks at who's talking you did you say something and the devil just look at it did you say something and you allow yourself to be depressed you're allow yourself to be angry you allow yourself to be enraged and and you you you try to come out of it the devil said did you say something and you keep managing that situation and you can also come to the point and realize I am the Son of God I can't live like this I cannot live like this if I have temper problem if I have anger if I have this I will bring it to the altar I don't care who looks at me I don't care who who's God's I don't care nothing I am going to come to God's order I am going to talk to God about this until God do something I will stay there the devil could be condemning your mind telling you kill yourself smoke weed get some injection salsa into your vein and you hear all those voice you can either decide to sit there and be sipping on the orange juice or whatever and allowed to be able to beat you down or you can come to God's presence and God this is me I'm beat up the devil is directing me right now I can't go on with this I need your help so we find out one time the whole world knew that it was God and as time begin to swing man begin to consecrate on their their evil ways and how did I lost that we're seeing Genesis 1 God created the Evans on the earth in Genesis 2 God put man in flesh in Genesis 2 almost ended God created all the animals and told Adam give their names and then I'm looking lion to say that is lion he never said linga you know there's something called linga that's kind of strange that's what man made man made linger God made lion so linga is a hybrid between it's a germ taken from a lion and a tiger so they created a creature they call linga so man has gone far a man will kill himself as we're spending time right now facing on God's word people are in Siberia digging fossils trying to get uh cells because they understand the beginning of breaking God into God's laboratory and they understand what cloning is because including in science you see you can only clone what they call a somatic cell somatic cell is capable of reproducing the entire creature so science has broken into God's laboratory and they realize they can do it because in Genesis 2 God took worry from Adam God did not promote clay and put a rip to it no that reap God took from Adam said made he what the woman so that rib was capable under the presence of God to grow and become a woman let me say it this way when God took that reap from Adam God was making something that we we've made today but in a different way God made a mirror Adam never knew what he looked like but the first time Adam would know what it looked like is when God took a read from him and made a mirror called the the woman and brother mirror before Adam when that mirrors stood before Adam I don't look at that mirror he said this is my image it's part of my bone flesh to my blessing this is me so now Adam God made something that Adam can look at Adam can have a concept of what he is so you don't have problem with your wife when you have problem with your mirror you clean it properly so you can see your face so if you have problem with your wife or you upload your husband you you know what to do if you can take care some of us will go to uh I care I care and all this uh Furniture houses and we buy mirrors what thousands of dollars and you have a mirror with you that you don't even value the one that is standing on the wall with all those decoration and all of those things it can only show you this cannot show you you really are it cannot show you temper that your temper I can't show you he cannot show you your anger he cannot show your prayer lesson it cannot show you your irresponsibility that mirror on the world cannot show you how irresponsible you are if you only show you that this should fit you it is sorry that the tie looks good on you it will show you that you are the main man if you show you that you are the guy that's only to show you but it will not show you how irresponsible you are he will not show you the irresponsible husband you have grown to be called because that's not the mirror God gave you the mirror God gave you to see yourself a slave before you but you turn your back on it [Music] foreign [Music] and then he made a mirror for Adam and when Adam looked at that mirror he said this is me this is Flesh of My Flesh this is born on my bone this is me so he gave me right now this is me woman because he were taken out of a man and so when you look at yourself on the mirror what you are seeing is what is taking out of you the mirror will not show Jeanette when you are standing on when John is standing on the mirror if you show John is that right if it's your image that you cast there so God made an image he made the Bible will tell you that later on he said man was made in the image of God and the woman was made in the image of the man so man was made in the image of God but the woman was made in the image of the man so all of this we're talking about one God understanding we know that there's just one God and this one God has taken a reap he has made a mirror for Adam so now Adam had a mirror he knows what he looked like he knows who he is he has named all the animals and he's going about his business because he has a mirror you know what I'm saying he has a mirror and God comes down to fellowship with other before Fellowship begins Adam stands before his mirror and make sure it's ready not the sister now it's not even standing before the mirror because if was the mirror let me not even use that word the woman was the mirror because God did not create Eve God created the woman the devil created Eve so we see right here God has given Adam a mirror another mirror before Fellowship begins you see God was orchestrating he was arranging Mothership God was arranging Fellowship so before Fellowship begin Adam and his mirror will first of all come in contact and prepare before God comes down So Adam has to stand before his mirror look at himself properly I said now we're good he carries me run is going to fellowship and the presence of God comes down in the garden and God is working and Adam and his mirror and God have glorious Fellowship God sees himself in Adam Adam sees himself in the mirror let's say praise God [Applause] that's what we call Fellowship God looks at the mirror God saw mirror was Adam Adam saw mirror is the woman so man is the ruler of the house that's not what was going on there and what was going on there is not some sister with some horn that I said to take the husband up and and hit him on the the overhead but what was going on here is fellowship God was putting Fellowship in perspective and fellowship should be God sees himself in Adam Adam sees himself in the woman oh God help us how girls will it be this morning if would have been said himself in his wife his wife is having that sister but you see yourself when we see ourselves in one another say proceed me you are not reading quote because I'm not going to read I'm going to preach quote but Abraham will tell us later on but Abraham said the bride is what the reflection of Christ because she is his mirror the bride is the mirror of Christ Christ looks at the bride he sees himself now when you are your wife you're having that torso when you're about ready to sign that divorce decree who are we seeing in you who is Christ seeing in you when you are ready to to put your cleanse your face and show your husband that look I'm I'm a different woman I can show you UFC or MMA or whatever name WWE I can I can show you all right look I'm not just I'm not just the girl you married some years ago I have learned who do we see at that point because Christ wants to see his reflection in this church every night at the church of Christ today how many a year at the church of Christ a new Church of Christ amen all right means your will Must Die everybody wants Christ as my Lord my My Savior My everybody want to be saved save from your credit card save from your car payment save from your mortgage but when it comes to Christ becoming your lord telling you how you should be sweet to your wife sweet to your husband you want to give quote why you should live your own life is that somebody that's in a beat somebody son will save him and he's giving you scriptures why you should die in that pit don't you know in Versa and soft Matthew I should remain here said put that give me the hand that flood is coming he's got snow storm says he said in John chapter 15 The Bible said I shall remain here that is what many of us are doing our homes are crumbling into Shred the devil is becoming the king of your house the devil there's a special Throne you have erected in your home and the devil is sitting right there ruining the husband ruling the wife and you are busy looking for the pastor or the Deacon that will tell you who is right and who is wrong shame on you there is no right and wrong in marriage don't be foolish in your mind you will be right in your wife's mind she will be right but the reality I told you we can live in our mind but we can still live in reality in reality the devil has taken over your home that is what is going on whether you are right or you are wrong the thing is that a king has taken over your home your domain has been ravish you are no more a king God said in Genesis 1 I have given you dominion over the Earth Somebody have taken over your dominion and is controlling you rage anger bitterness malice at times you cannot sleep let me give you a quote on what the brown said about that at times you can't sleep and you wonder what is going on and you are not sleeping because you have had it rough with your wife or you've had it rough with your neighbor and you are not even able to sleep guess what your neighbor is having good dreams your neighbor is having good dreams but you you are you are you are angry you are upset and your Facebook ugly your wife is probably looking at that ugly face no more because he has had that chicken and has drunk that uh strawberry smoothie and she's dreaming good dreams angels are visiting her white demons are dragging you apart your face is looking more ugly because you are you are misusing the muscles in your face science say take 70 he said take 75 percent of muscles to friend your face that's intensity it takes just 15 percent to smile so make your choice 75 percent to fry your face by just take 15 to smile and I tell you what the more you smile the better it is on your face your muscles will be relaxed when you are farming your face all the time wrinkles will be appearing no matter the Hollywood magazine you look at the bottles and the authors and the thoughts you put on your face your face will still wrinkled right in the message the infallibility of the word of God of the spoken word of God but Abraham prays that message 1946 April the 4th but Abraham said it is about 60 percent of the cause of all sickness is temper this is not what 60 percent of all sickness is what temper is the cause of heart attack when you are angry you see your blood pressure Rises and when you see that brother that you're having it rough with your your heart makes life the blood begin to pump like crazy temper is 60 cause of almost all sickness diabetes but the problem we're going to tell us that life lie causes cancer he said how did he know that yes he said he could see beyond the spirit and see how things start in their infancy may God help us we're going to be drawn to the close like I said and uh god with flesh whatever we have here in our homes when you go home and you have that genuine fellowship with God when you knee down and you're talking to God say God they're talking about a rap gift it's not just Christmas of Santa Claus and all those rubbish see they've removed God from what belongs to him they removed him from his rainbow they don't even know what the rainbow is you see what they call it rainbow because it's a bow that you shoot rain out of one time in Genesis as we progressed to Genesis chapter 6 God will tell Noah man's wickedness has hit the climbers I am going to destroy the world and God will send rain to the Earth and drink overflow the Earth and people gonna die like crazy they say God did that no it is the wickedness of man that did that to man God only took his head away a man will invent what will kill himself in the bid of trying to be smart he would destroy himself and so God he put that that ball in the sky after the war was over brother Steve God put that ball in the sky say whenever you see that ball the rainbow see what you call it rainbow he's an I was born it's a boat that you shoot the rain out of because when you see the rain falling from the sky it looks like a arrow is that right so God shot the judgment and God kept the bowl in the sky you see anytime you see the ball it means I'm not fighting wall so you know that you know that that's a sign that I will not destroy the Earth with water no more now people took that rainbow and they say you can marry a man can get married to a man a woman can get married to woman that's what it represents until you cannot even carry rainbow if you wear a shirt that's rainbow only God will be merciful to you even people that claim to be Christian they'll be looking at you strange that what just happened as he changed his mind has he lost it because they don't know what the rainbow is the rainbow represents God's mercy to you and me it doesn't represent the man marrying a woman and man marrying a man a woman it doesn't even represent any of those rubbish that men has made it today he doesn't even go close to that nonsense but what it means is that God is not going to judge this world and destroy it by water so we come to Genesis 4. Genesis 2 we see God took a mirror and then gave man the mirror a man will look at this mirror brother Steve he will know what he looks like and God will look at Adam God knows what he looked like as a man because God was never a man so for God knows what he looked like as a man so Adam was God's mirror of humanity if you want to know what God looked like as a man in animal skin look at Adam because either the spirit Son of God has been placed in flesh in Genesis 2 the Bible said God break the doors and put Adam said bread into that that nostril and Adam became a living Soul so the spirit God and His Spirit Soul he put his Spirit son in flesh now God's son now lives in flesh God is looking at Adam to see what God looked like in substance to see what God looked like in time in space in matter now God can see what he looked like because God is not flesh but now God knows what they look like in flesh when he's looking at Adam God did not name the animals he allowed them to name the animal because any name Adam gave them Bible said that was the name because Adam has the mind of God when you call your wife the b word where did that come from when you call your husband some crazy name where did that come from Adam not the mind of God and he said lion tiger Dove he was speaking the mind of God when you tell your husband this madman you are a Madman you can't do me nothing I will call the police on you where did that come from that obviously is not the mind of God it is a mind of somebody else you are expressing someone that person's mind and if it is not the mind of God it is the mind of the devil that doesn't mean you are condemned it's just me you have the wrong Channel we have to tune you again no when you have the radio those days and you're looking for a son and you are tuning already with the tuna you're hearing some Statics and cheese sweet dreams and then you you try and hear some violin I mean static [Applause] shed that that tone of God's Amazing Grace and that's what we see right there the Adam at that point God could see himself in Adam Adam could see himself in Eve and then we come to Genesis 3. this beauty was wrecked suppressive God could see himself in other Adam Adam could see himself in Eve and God in the woman and God came down and the fellowship is going on and before God comes down Adam first of all make sure very well he's seeing himself in the woman and then God comes down and God makes sure he's seeing himself in Adam but all of a sudden Buddies that faithful service they came God came down the rap gift came down again he comes every time and that day came to see himself in Adam he could not find Adam he was not in charge that day he had every reason to give no digging can talk to him after not is not paying my bill you don't know how hard I have to work to pay my bill so if you don't see me in church you have no right to come and talk to me Adam where did that come from the Bible said they were both naked and we are not ashamed yes Adam now God said Adam he said he said where you are you say God I'm hiding I'm ashamed I'm afraid because what is going on where did you get those language from now God has come to see himself in his son his son is hiding and speaking some dirty language I'm afraid where did you where did you get that from how did you learn the language fear where did that come from and I'm hiding where are you hiding not in God's secret place he was hiding behind leaves fig leaves remember in Psalms that we just read he said he that dwelleth in the sacred place of the most high so I'm Pride shall dwell in the shadows of the Almighty yes the Shadows of the almighty has come to see him saving Adam another was hiding in pig lips being just a church member I believe the message God sent us a prophet he was hiding on those but his life was not bringing anything that that did not death because Adam where are you for goodness sake where are you Adam he said God I'm scared where did you learn that from they said the woman you gave me blame the blame game started right away it's my wife that caused it I don't used to be angry you know I know you're so really angry you know I'm a patient man you know I'm very nice I'm very kind it is this bad wife that I married when you are giving that flower she was not bad when you when you were texting her 2 am in the morning she was not bad but now she's a nightmare to you that's what Adam said see is this bad is the woman you gave me say blame it on God it's the woman you gave me and God will go to the sister he says that won't cost it and she will blame it on some other person my husband didn't know what happened it was that brother that said this so he put it on brother serpent and brother serpent has nobody to blame me he took the blame right away the serpent had nobody to blame that's what the Bible said when when God said Adam said it is the woman and the woman said it is the serpent and God says servant because you have done this because you have wrecked this Fellowship now because they stopping God was not seeing himself in the serpent but God was seen himself in Adam Adam was Sinners I believe who invited this happened into this relationship who invited the serpent into this relationship oh man I just uh I just running out of time and I must obey time we will close the service even they have so much to lay out of my heart but I believe your relationship with God through whatever you have heard it it matters a whole lot huh what is the problem Adam where are you at he was hiding on that figure he made figures and covered himself but the Fig Leaf you can still see it through to his nakedness his anger was still coming out temper was he coming out he's all those fruits are from godliness we're destroying the ugly face but remember God has come down to see himself in his son his son wasn't in church freed where did that come from he's afraid now is even it's even bold enough to say it is a woman you gave me that that made this thing happen look at that he couldn't even take responsibility Adam almost looked like an American in that place yeah somebody is caught shooting and killing people in school and he's caught he he's not killed and when they catch him they will be giving him orange juice and giving hamburger I said we are investigating you like go and shoot people in Africa when they give you dirty slap on your face you will know where the Love Faces but they're giving him orange juice and they say it's my grandfather that assault me and my grandmother assault me and and and they said oh yeah he was assaulted when he was young and now people are beginning to feel entitled they can go into a place and kill people do what they like because they know that they're going to be giving presidential treatment yeah nobody nobody can be condemned unless it's tried but at least before your child you should go through some rigorous time so you understand that uh what they say this in Nigeria is khaki is not leather that's what they that's what they mean you go through some rigorous time and then you realize that it is not just as easy as it is but you see we're making it so easy so that's why it is reproducing itself every time every time you just want that guy shoot people and they they're giving a hamburger and they're talking to him why did you do that thank you don't cry don't cry you you don't cry don't cry we understand we understand we understand nothing when you take God away from man he becomes an animal and we are trying to pet this animal we are trying to pet this animal he's an animal the moment you leave him again he will create more Havoc than he has ever created because he's an animal right right yeah so we say in general history the disaster came something came between the mirror something came between the mirror and with that thing came God could no longer see himself in his song himself in his wife there was a disconnection right there and then and because they said this connection communication gap coexisted immediately between Adam and his wife they can no more communicate the way they used to communicate before at one time they could communicate but knowing me so that's thought but night is different now I just won't want to blame this one and that one want to blame that one everybody have blame in their mind I want to blame everybody for everything so then we drop into Genesis chapter 4. and when we drop into Genesis 4 chaos has already set in God can no more see himself in his son his son cannot see himself in the mirror so we already have chaos and in that Chaos two children were born kid on one hand an adult on the other hand and these two children they have one pastor Pastor Adam any priests every service day he tell them oh my prince after the service is over he tell them how they used to live in the place where God could see himself in Adam could see himself in in the woman and he said I can't even see myself in hand no more because she's if she's the mother of all living and not bought good and bad at one time I couldn't see myself enough but now she reflect Both Worlds she reflect both Good and Evil So Adam is not evil So Adam can't see himself no more in the woman God can see himself no more in Adam so God have to make a way right there and then God have to slay them to cover them up so God can look through the blood of that lamb to see Adam again so God has time went on he consistently provided a lamb so he can succeed through that land because retro red is white so God could look through that Bloody lamb and then he could see Adam but a view of Adam was not clear it's lost it Genesis chapter 4 King and Abel they come into church every day they end the message of the hour there was a message of that hour then yes amen praise God and Adam said oh God drove us out because of our sin or one day we're going to go back and there's going to be a shed blood that will take us back and everybody heard that word blood a little bit warned and got himself a lamb and slayed the lamb and God looked through that land and saw a bear and Cain went and put Beauty spending time with Christmas tree Christmas flower and all those things and he did not even know the purpose of Christmas Santa Claus and Satan's claw and all the clothes all around you and what's the meaning of Christmas and Cain lost the meaning of worship both of them came to church that day but Cain came without the revelation it was sweet but that area he came so sweet my friend he was so sweet he was coming just like they sing in the Catholic church [Music] just so holy it's not a son that make you holy after your son God was here and you'll be raping boys and girls what a Madness a king was coming under that guys and when he was coming God could not see himself in him but he was coming to God but God couldn't see nothing again foreign is all human humanistic worship did not even Ascend anywhere that's why when you are here this morning don't don't don't put on nothing you standing before he lead that he want to see himself in you don't put on nothing just call me the pants that you want to put up take your lip read and come here let God meet you and change you don't change yourself just come to where you are and call God ask God for the change Come Just the Way You Are the musicians can come up we have to try to recluse but we will close the service yeah can push it better than what the Holy Ghost we put in your heart show me your face that's my message this morning that's the gift that God can unwrap for you is God's own face hmm Moses didn't say God show me your face he said God show me your glory god said if you see my face why is God talking of face Moses said Show Me Your Glory but God said if you see my face the communication does not right Moses asking for Show Me Your Glory God say if you see my face you will die now the face that God was talking of I have to jump to the end of my message Father me I just have to God will arrange it in your heart the path that we escape God told me to almost 38 18. he says show me what your glory let's open to that scripture we close it don't worry the chicken is not going to burn we're getting close to it amen the restaurant some of them they are still open some are closed don't worry you'll be all right we are in this together we're here to 20 one another and making sure that look good so God can see himself in US what did he say somebody read that Exodus 38 18. 32 18. 3 18 sorry yeah 33 18. sorry I think 10 3 18. the Feast of unleavened bread Exodus 33 18. yes we all right yeah don't worry all right and he said should be me the glory show me what what does 39 say 19 33 19. look at what he said on the board Moses just asked God something show me what it needs to show me your face he said Show Me Your Glory but what did God say listen to what God Said God said if you see my face and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee but I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and I will I'll be gracious home I'll be gracious too I will show Mercy on whom I will show Mercy to I think a verse there before that should talk about if you see my face you you'll die yeah and he said thou cannot see my face for there's a normal see me and what a leaf now let's just hold it right there just leave it right there you cannot see my face for there is no man there shall no man see me and one live now there's a face of God that if you see you die Moses was asking for God's glory god is bringing something that Moses was not asking for my if you see my face he'll die no man will be able to see my face now you can see when Manoa the father of Samson and his mother when they saw God in form of an Angel what did they say he said we've seen God we're going to die that's where that teaching come from if you see God you die but manoha the father of Samson and the mother of Samson they saw God they didn't die which means the face that God was talking about was not the first they saw because God does not lie when you see God's first you will die but Samson's father and his mother saw God's face and they said we have seen God we're going to die but did they die no which means they didn't see that face that kills the man you're talking about Genesis 18 God came down with two angels did Abraham see him come on trust did Abraham say God in Genesis 18 yes when God came to Abraham was he walking like this Lord he came face to face did Abraham died no because the first God was talking of was not what Abraham saw [Music] everybody's afraid of that but God said if you see my face you will die my Noah and his wife said oh God we're gonna die we'll see in this place we'll see this says we're going to die they didn't die because the first that kills a man was not what they saw the face that kills a man was not what Abraham saw Joshua am I ready to go find that great fight and the angel of God God himself came down and just said are you for us or are you against us did Joshua see the person he was talking to did you see his face yes he saw but did he die no which means the face that Joshua saw it's not the face that make you die [Music] I'm closing [Music] time to your neighbor say God bless you but Abraham said that's the that's the greatest thing you can tell it man [Music] Catherine can you put uh John 1 18 on the boat on the wall just follow me God created you as his mirror he wants to see himself through you you are not involved in this business so your mind and what you want they may look great but it's not greater than what God wants to see you your plans your Visions your artillery is not greater than what God wants to see you God wants to see himself in you do you know how serious that is foreign you want to see yourself in your wife honey we're going to this concert I want to put on this skirt I want to dress like because there's a test in your in your heart you want you want to see God wants to see himself in you [Music] okay can we read this together slowly no man I've seen God at is that true we're going to read the remaining perfect is that true it didn't say no man are saying God he didn't stop right here he said at any time who did Abraham see in Genesis 18. come on to us read the Bible come on you read your Bible zombie we are not in class we are Christians so if you read your Bible you don't read mind I read my you read yours we are in the same Bible so who did Abraham see in Genesis 18. in case you're afraid we can put it so you can read it so we can read it [Music] talking about God seeing himself in you this is serious business God seen himself in you genocity and who appeared okay so we are on the same page the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day it was who they appeared let's go back to John 1 18. now God just said mercy God Show Me Your Glory that's what we're asking for God I want to do miracle I want to do great this when I preach this we know that I'm the great preacher God said you can't see my face you asking for Glory but God said you can't see my face but but does he want you to see his face all right doesn't want to see his face you can't see my face why because the hour has not come for you to see but doesn't want to see his face no matter seeing God at any time they only begotten son the only flesh the mirror because God loves them first mirror to express himself so God got another mirror of Mary and God enter that mirror and we knew that mirrors Jesus the mirror was not just a man that mirror was God hiding in a man [Applause] and that sent God that was hiding in that man will not only begotten son that same God want to hide in you that's him God want to hide in your dirty heart he wants to clean it you don't know how to walk with that heart but God knows what to do with it are you not to do without this rage anger behind us correctly but God knows what to do with it which is what he had declared him Adam was supposed to declare God but now he cannot declare God he's guilty he's blaming his wife his wife is blaming in they're blaming the servant everybody's blaming everybody there is interest service what like this in everybody's blame it's a blame game foreign together and bro Steve get the trash bag let's dump the plane inside a trash bag your pride your anger that is hindering you from repenting it used to be tears was a glorious thing in the house of God he used to be repentance was a glorious sin in the house of God but now it's a shameful for to cry repent if you tell somebody say You must be born again you are insulting me [Music] the blessings has become the cause we are almost
