[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] now we find out here notice in his shadow again the the lamb is to be kept up now this is not in Exodus 12 if you're Mark you're down Exodus 12 3-6 the lamb must be kept up four days to be tried to see if it's worthy to go to the sacrifice yet must be tough examine over and over for four days to see if there's a blemish on it see if there's any sickness in it see if there's anything wrong with the lamb it must be kept up uh four days I know somebody might thought that's a little bit killer on the 14th but remember they tucked the Lamb on the 10th day of the month and killed it on the 14th day of the month see which has kept up for four days now Jesus God's name lamb went into Jerusalem and never came out again until after his death burial and Resurrection he was kept up under critics for four days and four nights amen how perfect that lamb was tied kept up for four days that's when pilate said I can find no fault in him another shadow of him no bone could be broken in him which is perfectly when they're cutting and killing his sacrifice he couldn't break a bone if it was it was refused and they already dropped the hammer back to break the bones in the legs of Christ when they said he's already dead that pierced his side and found blood and water notice again another great thing you're I wouldn't skip it by because he was represented in the offerings the meal offering I remember one time they had a school in the Bible called the school of the prophets and it was quite a school and we find out that Elijah went up there that school one day and they said we they prayed him to leave said when you're around here things are too straight so he wanted to get away and they went out to get him a dinner and a bunch of the priests went out or prophets to get some peas to make a dinner for him and when they did they've gathered a great big apron full of them and when they come back it was wild gourds which was poison and they told him into the pot and the pots began to boil and then somebody said alas there's death in the pot now we can't even eat and Elijah said bring me a handful of meals and he tucked the kneel and threw it into the pot and said eat the pots healed the meal offering was Christ every Burr had to be set the same and every little piece of Neil had to be ground the same for the me offering showing that he is the Healer he substitutes and takes away death and puts life for the truth hallelujah comes in life comes in he's the same yesterday today and forever and where there was death there became life because that Christ was brought in that meal offers what a great lessons that these things to be if we take time to break them out no no not one word of the Shadows fail not one word ever failed of the Shadow everything typed perfectly he's God's chosen place of worship and God's name is given to him he is God's place of worship and God's name is given to him he is the word of God and he is the name of God he's both the word of God and the name of God he was a word made flesh he was the word of God Lamb of God name of God and was God that's what he was the Chosen and only place of worship to God God refuses any other place besides in Jesus Christ you cannot worship him anywhere he said in vain they do worship me teaching for a Doctrine the Commandments of man the day we have Creeds dogmas and everything it teaches this is a way of that is way and Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and no man can come to God except by me in other words I am the door to the Sheepfold all without her thieves he is the only approach he's the door he's the way the truth the life all that there is the only entrance the only place the only worship The Only Name everything is tied to Jesus Christ all the Old Testament is tied to in the New Testament tied to and the church today is tied to him by the word of his commandment there's not another place or another name or anywhere where God ever promised to meet a man only in Jesus Christ his chosen place of worship notice God has promised to meet his worshipers and only this one please and that is of his own choosing not of our choosing not of our thinking but of his thank you his choosing and it would be the place where he put his name where he chose so we find out that we find where his name was what he chose by his own choosing now that we have found the place he put his name that is in Christ Jesus and there is no other place or no other name are you satisfied of that say Amen now the thing of it is if we find where the place is that's worship place is nowhere accepted only in Christ you can repent you can do that but you're not worshiping it you're asking for pardon Peter said on the day of Pentecost when they've seen them all speaking with tongues and great signs and wonders taking place they begin to laugh the church didn't said these men are full of new wine they act like drunk people look married the Virgin all of them are together 120 of them and they were staggered like drunk men and speaking in tongues and carrying on he said these men are full of new wine but Peter's standing up said man and brethren these men are not full of new wine or this is just a third hour today but this is that we just spoke about by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy upon my hands maids and made servant will I pour out of my spirit I'll show signs in the heavens above and on Earth fire pillars of fire Vapors of smoke it shall come to pass before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come to whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said man and brother what can we do Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises that all future Generations now we find that now we want to find how we get into him how do we get into this place of worship First Corinthians 12 settles it four by one spirit not by one church not by one Creed not by One Pastor not by one Bishop not by one priest but by one Holy Spirit we are all ties into one body which is the body of Jesus Christ and subject to every gift that lays in that bodies yes sir no joining no reciting of Creeds no pumping up letting down hands shaking another but by birth we are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ amen by one Holy Spirit we are all baptized into one body and what is that body in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us how can we be in that body and deny one word of it and place it all somewhere else that's not even in the body how can we ever do it God's chosen place notice I'm when you are truly baptized into him the true evidence is that you believe him the word how can you be a part of him and then tonight how can I deny my hand be in my hand if they're if I do something mentally wrong with me and how can I uh if there's something mentally wrong with me deny that's my hand so now that's my foot there's something spiritually wrong with the believer that denies any word that God ever said and promise is something spiritually wrong with that so-called believer you can't deny one letter of him because you have become a part of the same you are part of him because you're baptized into him by the Holy Spirit has brought you into the body of Jesus Christ what a beautiful thing God had a certain place to met he met Abraham and there Abraham worshiped all down to the Testament and his promised work will be interpreted In You by him did you get that the word that he promised to fulfill in the day that you're living in you will be a written Epistle of God rid of all man not what you claim but what God does to you you will speak out louder than anything you could claim [Applause] God said these signs shall follow them that believe that speaks to you he spoke of this age what would be now the Believers at this age has to believe this what he promised today just the same as had to come into the ark to be saved go out of Egypt to be saved they have to come into Christ to be saved now into the word message that he's the same yesterday today and forever how do you get into it by baptism baptism of what water by the Holy Ghost one Spirit we're all baptized into this one body and his promised word he will not you won't have to interpret it he will interpret it through you what you are doing what he promised to do the church that follows him will be so much like him until the people are no look at Peter and John when he was questioned about healing a man at the gate called Beautiful they said they perceived those priesthood that they were both ignorant and unlearned man but they take notice that they had been with Jesus because what they were doing the things that he did you must be about the father's business and today it must be the same I remember he's the same yesterday today and forever for God meets you in him the only place there is for it that is where he has chosen to put his name in Jesus Jesus is the name of God remember father son Holy Ghost is titles to the name Jesus Christ when Matthew said go therefore teach All Nations baptize them and to the name of the father of the son and of the Holy Ghost how it's been misinterpreted and say in the name of the father name of the son name of the Holy Ghost it's not even written it's in the name singular of the father son Holy Ghost father is not a name Sons not an eve Holy Ghost is not a name it's a title ten days later Peter stood up and said repent every one of you be baptized the name of Jesus Christ told him not to do he did what he told him to do the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ every person in the New Testament was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not one person in the Bible was ever baptized in the titles of father son Holy Ghost man that never did come into existence until the nazia Creed was put on it and I see a room there was an order of the Catholic Church found Vindicated the same thing in the catechism I've got it that's right facts of our faith and so forth that it absolutely is a Roman Catholic Creed they'll tell you it's not the Bible but they say they have power to change them words if they wish you because of the Pope are different Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and whosoever shall take one word out of this Bible said Jesus or put one word in it his part will be taken from The Book of Life One Word not a sentence or paragraph but a word whosoever shall take one word in the beginning God fortified his people with his word one word misconstrued caused every death ever heartache every sorrow Eve she never broke a sentence she broke a word when Jesus come in the middle of the book that's the first of the book when Jesus come in the middle of a book what did he say it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth thou the mouth of God in the last of the book Revelations the 22nd chapter the 18th verse the very last part of the Bible Jesus speaks himself said I'll testify that if any man shall take one word out of this book or add one word to it his part will be taken out of the book of life because he's a false prophet and has misconstrue the people and their black will be accounted to his hand of doing so we must keep that one place of worship that is Jesus Christ the word the same yesterday today and forever amen all right remember there's no other meeting place to worship not a place God chose it John way back younger at the time between the New and Old Testament listen close now notice closely John that great eagle come flying from the Wilderness one day his great Wings spread he lay down on the bank of the Jordan Hallelujah a great Eagle prophet that bridge the way between the Old and New Testament and he called him from right and left he was calling a day of repentance I work on the Pharisees and Sadducees out he said don't begin to say within yourself we have Abraham to our father because I'll tell you God is able these stones to write your name oh my God when he began to throw his gospel out and saying there stands one among you who you don't know I'm not yet identified but I'll know him when he comes I'm not worthy to lose his shoe but he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire and your man is in his hands he'll thoroughly purchase Lord he'll burn the chapters that great gospel Eagle sitting there as he crowed out his great threats and the don't come out or Herod they Emperor at that time proctimator mirrors brother's wife and could you imagine that big gospel Eagle sitting there and holding this piece of that some of them said don't you preach on marriage and divorce now John those air says Herod walk that up in his face and said it's not lawful for you to have while he wasn't he was that eagle from the Wilderness he wasn't trained under man's scares and threats of some denomination but he was trained under the power of almighty God to know what would be he knowed the identification of the Messiah the word means praise our God don't get scared I've never hurt nobody yet I'm not excited I know right where I am holding out think of him that big eagle flying out there and sitting down he said I'll know him when he comes one day you were standing there preaching the priest was across the other side said you mean there come a time the daily sacrifice will be taken away this great template we're building all the work we put on our speak denomination he said there'll come a time when all that'll be done away and treat me you're a false prophet and he looked around he said behold there he is there's just a lamb the real lamb that takes away the sin of the world [Music] he didn't say here comes the method he sure comes the Badness of the Catholic he said there comes a lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and all his safeties on there is is in that Lamb of God get him alone is salvation not in any church any Creed any people any father any mother any holy man or nothing holy place it's in the holy God the Lord Jesus Christ where God placed his name on a human being for Redemption who paid the price for us sinners that's the only place that there is salvation that's a rock I stand on John identified him he said I didn't know him when I saw him come walking up but out there where I got my schooling yeah not in the Seminary like his daddy did not as a priest train but in the wilderness why was in the Theological Seminary of almighty God Amen waiting for God's word not what some group of men had hatched up but what God had said about it and when John looked up and saw the Spirit coming he said I bear a record this is him oh my there's your place of worship there's your hiding place there's a lamb of God that takes away the sin of up not no church no Creed or nothing else amen but the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world see how John placed it he didn't say you Pharisees right you said you sees herodians he said Bears the lamb that's the place he's got the name he is the one not another name under heaven watch what Jesus said about John now one day John said to him to see what he's doing Jesus said of him he was that great and Shining Light to show them the right path that they should follow before his Advent his first event listen close don't miss it Jesus said John was that light Malachi 3 no mistake the prophet with the great Shining Light identified Jesus as being the only one the lamb all other Lambs that priest was talking about all them other things is foolish yeah was the lamb the man with the great Shining Light that Jesus said he was Malachi 3 said I'll send my messenger before my face to prepare the way and the one that was sent to prepare the way identified him the place amen that's him there's no mistake that's him amen I see the sign following I know that that's him a light coming down from heaven and going upon him he was positive that was him that my brother [Music] foreign foreign [Music]
