[30:55] tonight uh
[30:56] we will
[30:59] get back to our subject we've been
[31:01] speaking on
[31:02] but i was thinking to
[31:05] to uh
[31:08] look into something there
[31:10] i prayed uh the lord would make it a
[31:12] blessing
[31:13] so uh we will read in john chapter five
[31:22] now you have to remember that
[31:24] we've been talking on the harmony
[31:29] the harmony with the father and the son
[31:31] or harmony between the father and the
[31:33] son whichever way
[31:35] we've been we've been saying it it's
[31:37] just something like that we've been
[31:38] trying to say praise the lord you know
[31:40] it's one of those things trying to say
[31:42] something and highly get to see it right
[31:44] amen
[31:45] and you just you just have a thought
[31:47] right there in your head so
[31:49] uh
[31:51] but uh when when uh
[31:53] [Music]
[31:55] brother branham referred to that
[31:57] uh which of course is being our
[32:00] uh primary quote we've been reading
[32:02] through this subject
[32:04] from the pagaramus church age he says
[32:06] notice the harmony of the father and the
[32:09] son the harmony of the father and the
[32:11] son jesus never did anything
[32:14] until it was first shown him by the
[32:18] father
[32:19] saint john 5. so
[32:21] he was referring to saint john 5 19. now
[32:24] i want for us to go back and and read in
[32:26] john 5
[32:28] uh reading reading from verse 1.
[32:32] praise the lord
[32:37] saint john 5 let's uh
[32:39] read from verse 1.
[32:54] praise the lord
[32:56] amen
[32:59] saint john chapter 5
[33:01] after this there was a feast of the jews
[33:05] and jesus went up to jerusalem
[33:08] now jerusalem what uh now
[33:10] there
[33:12] is at jerusalem by the ship market a
[33:15] pool
[33:16] which is called in the hebrew town
[33:20] they'll test there
[33:22] having five pouches
[33:27] in this late a great multitude of
[33:30] important folks
[33:32] of blind hearth weather waiting for the
[33:36] moving
[33:37] off the water
[33:40] for an angel went down at a certain
[33:43] season
[33:44] into the pool and troubled the water
[33:48] whosoever then first after the troubling
[33:52] of the water step
[33:54] in was made whole
[33:57] of whatsoever
[33:59] disease he had
[34:02] and a certain man was there
[34:05] which had an infirmities
[34:07] thirty and eight years
[34:12] when jesus saw him
[34:14] lay
[34:15] and knew that he had been now
[34:19] a long time in this case he said unto
[34:22] him will thou be made hold
[34:26] the important man
[34:28] answered him sir i have no man when the
[34:32] water is troubled to put me
[34:35] into the pool
[34:37] but why
[34:39] i am coming another step down before me
[34:42] jesus said unto him
[34:45] rise take up that bed and walk
[34:50] and immediately
[34:52] praise the lord
[34:54] amen
[34:55] and immediately
[34:58] the man was made hold
[35:00] and took up his bed
[35:03] and walk
[35:04] praise the lord
[35:07] what a sight to see the man
[35:11] what a sight to see that in an immediate
[35:14] healing and immediate moving of god and
[35:17] immediately the man was made whole
[35:20] and took up his bed and walked
[35:23] and on the same day was the sabbath
[35:28] the lord bless you you may have your
[35:29] seat because you continue to read
[35:33] maybe that's what we might just do
[35:34] tonight just read
[35:36] read the bible pray and go home praise
[35:38] the lord
[35:39] amen
[35:40] that's god's word that's that's what uh
[35:47] that's the most important word here
[35:48] tonight
[35:51] verse 10 and the jews therefore said
[35:54] unto him
[35:56] that was killed it
[35:58] it is the sabbath day
[36:01] it is not lawful for thee to carry their
[36:04] bed
[36:06] amen
[36:08] he answered them he that made me hold
[36:12] the same said unto me and take up that
[36:14] bed and walk
[36:18] then you know what the jews were talking
[36:20] about they were they were trying to tell
[36:21] the man you know this is church order
[36:25] trying to say this is church order you
[36:27] know don't break the church order now
[36:29] praise the lord i'm just i'm just saying
[36:31] it that way
[36:33] because i want to grab your attention on
[36:35] something tonight
[36:39] and he answered
[36:41] he
[36:42] that made me hold the the same said unto
[36:44] me and take up the bed and walk
[36:47] then ask the him what man is that we
[36:51] said unto thee take up that bed and walk
[36:56] and he that was healed
[36:59] with that who it was for jesus
[37:02] had conveyed himself away
[37:05] a multitude being in the place afterward
[37:08] jesus foundeth him in the temple and
[37:10] said and said unto him behold thou are
[37:14] made whole
[37:15] saint no more lest a worse thing come
[37:19] unto them
[37:21] the man departed and told the jews that
[37:23] it was jesus
[37:25] which have made him whole praise the
[37:27] lord well he said it in bad faith oh he
[37:31] said it in good faith i believe he said
[37:32] it in good faith amen
[37:34] because they wanted to know who gave him
[37:36] that instruction
[37:39] let's read a little bit
[37:44] and therefore did the jews persecute
[37:46] jesus and sought
[37:48] to slay him because he have done these
[37:51] things on the sabbath day
[37:54] not because he have healed the man
[37:57] praise the lord
[37:59] amen
[38:01] but because
[38:02] he has he has breaking the the church
[38:05] order all he you know uh he has breaking
[38:09] what to them is the lord
[38:12] hallelujah
[38:14] then jesus answered them my father
[38:18] worketh heaven in our work
[38:21] therefore the jews sought the more to
[38:23] kill him because
[38:25] he not only have broken the sabbath but
[38:28] said also that god was his father making
[38:32] himself equal with god
[38:36] then answered jesus and said unto them
[38:39] verily verily i said unto you
[38:42] the son can do nothing of himself
[38:47] but what he serious the father do
[38:50] for what
[38:51] things so ever he does this also does
[38:55] the son likewise
[38:59] may the law our blessing on the reading
[39:00] of the word
[39:02] praise the lord
[39:04] amen

[40:04] uh when we when you just look at the the
[40:08] the the scripture there the story about

[40:22] through the night to return back to his
[40:24] father house to return back to that
[40:27] mountain where god met him
[40:29] praise the lord
[40:30] and year he said he's about to leave
[40:33] he's about to leave his denomination
[40:36] praise the lord he's about to leave his
[40:39] denomination
[40:41] and
[40:43] and then
[40:43] [Music]
[40:46] rachel
[40:47] the church
[40:48] a type of the church
[40:50] is now going to take uh
[40:54] you know an idol
[40:56] she's going to take something
[40:58] of the old beliefs system
[41:03] praise the lord
[41:04] amen
[41:05] she's going to take something of the old
[41:07] belief system now what i want to write
[41:10] on tonight
[41:11] is that uh it has always been
[41:15] whenever
[41:16] man is is moving on you will see that
[41:19] all true history
[41:21] uh whenever man god called abraham you
[41:24] know
[41:27] to a land who maker and bitter was god
[41:29] when he was coming he brought his his
[41:31] his father brought his his nephew lord
[41:34] and all of that so it is it is always
[41:37] with us amen
[41:39] it is always with us
[41:42] when god calls us
[41:44] when he calls when we hear the voice of
[41:46] god and we give in to the call
[41:50] if we did not bring with us a religious
[41:53] idol we would bring some family idol
[41:56] praise the lord or we would bring our
[41:59] own self idol
[42:03] some kind of a sticky nature of ourself
[42:07] we will we will we will come to the
[42:09] court of god
[42:12] praise the lord
[42:13] now so you will realize that uh
[42:16] uh it has always been like that
[42:19] it has always been like that
[42:22] i'm i'm caught up in between the thought
[42:24] here but i pray that the lord will will
[42:26] be able to
[42:27] to
[42:30] to help us as we as we will study
[42:32] tonight
[42:34] and uh and and as we as we go along
[42:37] serving the law we realize that uh you
[42:40] know uh it has always happened in every
[42:42] revival i was just i was just listening
[42:45] to something standing a little bit this
[42:47] uh uh sometime today
[42:50] and and uh uh even
[42:53] when when luther came out
[42:56] when he when he got the revelation you
[42:58] know that the josh shall live by faith
[43:01] you have to remember now he was a
[43:03] catholic priest
[43:04] amen
[43:06] and uh uh
[43:08] this this scripture this uh
[43:11] scripture in the bible came to life
[43:15] praise the lord
[43:17] he saw it it is not it is it is not by
[43:20] works it is not you know dragging on the
[43:22] ground and cutting yourself and whipping
[43:25] yourself and and trying to self-please
[43:27] god
[43:29] he saw it it just came to life that is
[43:32] it is the just the just shall live by
[43:35] faith is what christ have done
[43:38] amen having faith in the finished work
[43:41] of jesus christ
[43:44] praise the lord
[43:47] that's what he saw
[43:49] but you you you will see it also that
[43:54] even though
[43:56] even though
[43:58] uh uh
[43:59] during that revival
[44:02] you know uh people started uh
[44:05] uh rejoicing in the word you know this
[44:08] there they started uh uh now having
[44:10] access to the bible when they never who
[44:12] have asked us to to read the bible you
[44:15] know and all of that
[44:17] but there was a system that was already
[44:20] on the ground catholicism was ruling the
[44:23] word at that time
[44:26] praise the lord
[44:27] now
[44:29] they are seeing a a work of god they are
[44:32] seeing a work of grace
[44:34] and uh
[44:36] but yet there is there was there was
[44:38] some sense of fear for the people to
[44:42] completely move into
[44:44] what god was doing
[44:48] praise the lord
[44:49] those that that that move into a
[44:52] zwingling and the rest of them you know
[44:55] the broad uh are legalizing and and you
[44:58] know in a way to control the people
[45:02] praise the lord amen
[45:05] that's the reason why brother branham
[45:08] says
[45:09] uh uh luther
[45:10] greatest
[45:12] miracle that he had in his revival was
[45:15] to keep his head above all the
[45:18] foundation
[45:21] and all the fanaticism that was
[45:22] happening around him
[45:25] people were still sticking to the uh uh
[45:30] catholic worship people were
[45:33] were running ahead and becoming fanatics
[45:36] you know people were you know now now
[45:39] you know uh uh uh condemning the the old
[45:43] system in a very rude way you know and
[45:46] all of those things were happening
[45:49] praise the lord
[45:51] but the messenger was keeping himself
[45:56] right in the middle
[45:58] he was doing his best to stay with with
[46:01] what with the way that god was dealing
[46:03] with him
[46:08] are we together
[46:10] praise the lord now watch this also
[46:15] and uh uh
[46:17] i mean capitalism was ruling europe at
[46:19] the time
[46:20] but after
[46:22] uh a luther revival
[46:24] broadband make us to know that that that
[46:27] that wane of revival started going now
[46:30] and it's leaving germany now is going
[46:32] down to england
[46:35] okay
[46:36] and what happened was
[46:39] the the
[46:40] the
[46:41] how we were calling now the cardinal
[46:44] you know uh uh uh the cardinal the
[46:47] bishop dead of england of the church of
[46:49] england
[46:51] has come to a conviction
[46:55] that he must get away from uh uh uh
[46:58] being single and and and married
[47:03] and the catholic church will not change
[47:05] that doctrine
[47:07] watch now
[47:09] praise the lord
[47:11] because uh luther have already started a
[47:14] revival for the people to go back to the
[47:16] word
[47:19] okay
[47:20] so now they are reading the word
[47:23] and now he he has come to a conviction
[47:26] that no this thing is not a calling to
[47:28] the word
[47:29] i have a right to get married the church
[47:32] said no you won't
[47:34] this is our daughter and you will not
[47:35] get married
[47:39] praise the lord
[47:42] so what happened because now
[47:45] he was the cabinet he was the the bishop
[47:49] over england
[47:52] he decided to cut
[47:56] the church
[47:57] that he was bishop over
[47:59] all the people of england away from the
[48:02] catholic system
[48:05] so there
[48:06] the church of england gave birth
[48:12] to death
[48:14] praise the lord
[48:16] so the cop they cut away now from uh
[48:19] from from catholicism
[48:22] only with the sense that now the priests
[48:25] no more
[48:27] can live under that dogma of catholicism
[48:30] amen
[48:31] now the the priests honor this new
[48:34] church system the church of england now
[48:36] can get married
[48:38] for their king our agglican church and
[48:39] all of that
[48:41] praise the lord
[48:42] amen
[48:44] now wash now what i want you to see is
[48:46] this
[48:47] even though
[48:49] they got that
[48:51] understanding
[48:53] but the church still kept the adult
[48:59] richer still kept the idol of her father
[49:07] praise the lord
[49:09] amen
[49:11] until when the truth revival came
[49:15] of sanctification through john wesley
[49:18] the african church could not embrace it
[49:26] are you grabbing the picture
[49:30] even though now they are saying that we
[49:32] we are no longer uh
[49:34] a catholic church this is the church of
[49:37] england
[49:41] and we we're going to we we are going
[49:44] back to the bible
[49:48] like every one of them says
[49:50] let's go back to the bible
[49:55] amen
[49:59] but yet when when the revival
[50:03] what god wanted to do that he stirred
[50:05] the water
[50:09] the real move of god
[50:12] was not just to bring the people out of
[50:15] catholicism but to cleanse them and take
[50:18] them into a life of sanctification
[50:26] but when that real move started
[50:29] the church of england could not embrace
[50:31] it
[50:32] they rejected it
[50:38] i was uh and then
[50:41] as we learned brother branham says every
[50:44] revival
[50:46] comes
[50:47] almost at the end of the age
[50:51] amen
[50:53] at the end of the age
[50:55] entering into
[50:56] the new day
[50:59] the principle of creation the evening
[51:02] and the morning where the first day the
[51:04] evening and the morning was the second
[51:06] day
[51:09] so the light comes in the evening time
[51:15] praise the lord
[51:17] amen
[51:19] so when england rejected the revival
[51:22] then pretty soon
[51:24] all those evangelists that was seeing
[51:27] the importance of preaching
[51:29] sanctification started running to
[51:31] america
[51:37] nyani started having great revival
[51:39] meetings in america just to bring to
[51:42] birth
[51:44] azusa street
[51:49] which is the pentecostal revival
[51:59] are we together
[52:06] the
[52:07] the
[52:07] uh the tennessee now
[52:10] let's get to our strip tree a little bit
[52:11] here i could i can get in this thing and
[52:13] just keep going here
[52:15] and keep going and keep going
[52:18] we read here there's a place i want for
[52:20] us to get but the reason why i read this
[52:24] is to show us how
[52:26] they have kept
[52:30] the
[52:30] the ordinance of coming to this pool and
[52:33] waiting
[52:34] waiting for for for the angel to move
[52:37] upon the water
[52:39] amen
[52:40] and this man has been yeared you know
[52:42] about about 38 years what he's been
[52:45] there for 38 years or his sickness his
[52:48] was 38 years
[52:50] uh uh but he was he was you know always
[52:53] at this place hoping
[52:56] hoping that
[52:57] either somebody would feel sorry for him
[52:59] because i think he was pleading to jesus
[53:02] i don't have anybody to push me in the
[53:03] water
[53:06] if you really care for me stand by maybe
[53:08] when the water moves then you can push
[53:10] me
[53:13] praise the lord
[53:15] are we together
[53:17] but the same angel
[53:21] that was moving upon the water now was
[53:23] on two feet
[53:31] are we together
[53:33] now
[53:34] that's that's uh uh the place where
[53:38] god has always made provision for his
[53:41] people
[53:42] amen
[53:44] because divine healing has always been
[53:47] part of the covenant of god amen
[53:50] he has always made provision for his
[53:53] people
[53:55] it's it's it's always part of the
[53:56] atonement it's uh divine healing is part
[53:58] of the atonement so god has always made
[54:01] provision for his people
[54:07] during the time of moses he gave them
[54:09] the brazen serpent
[54:13] praise the lord
[54:18] and their instruction was to look at the
[54:21] serpent
[54:24] that's the only way they will be healed
[54:27] from the snake bite
[54:30] praise the lord
[54:32] now even at the time that plagued finish
[54:36] the the serpent the brazen serpent
[54:39] remain as a symbol of healing
[54:44] praise the lord
[54:45] so now when the people
[54:48] are sick
[54:51] or someone is a
[54:52] child is crying from a stomach ache
[54:56] or wake up with a headache
[54:59] because now something is in the camp
[55:01] that represents healing the first thing
[55:04] in the morning the first thing that mama
[55:06] will do is to run that boy up and say
[55:08] and say honey look
[55:10] no don't look at me look dean
[55:12] honey look look
[55:14] turn your eyes this way and look there
[55:18] amen
[55:21] because
[55:24] that was god's provision
[55:29] are you getting the hiding
[55:32] amen
[55:33] and the people
[55:35] you know uh
[55:36] now who looked to the brazen serpent and
[55:39] they kept it in the camp it was a sign
[55:41] of healing
[55:43] because they experienced healing
[55:47] praise the lord
[55:50] now what happened then pretty soon the
[55:52] people started making the the the brazen
[55:55] step and their their attention is now
[55:58] caught up to the brazen serpent that god
[56:01] is not even in their mind anymore as god
[56:05] the healer
[56:06] praise the lord
[56:10] they can
[56:11] they will disobey the commandments of
[56:13] god
[56:14] praise the lord they will disregard
[56:17] god's word but now they have embracing
[56:20] second that when they are sick they can
[56:22] go there and you know and play some
[56:24] religion
[56:31] praise the lord
[56:33] something that god
[56:36] raised up among them
[56:38] to testify
[56:40] that he is the one that healed their
[56:42] disease
[56:45] god raised it up among them
[56:50] praise the lord
[56:55] for them to acknowledge him
[57:00] it was just a matter a price that moses
[57:04] burned
[57:08] now grab this again
[57:11] he's the same lord god
[57:14] that commanded his children against
[57:16] grieving image
[57:22] amen
[57:24] he commanded them against grieving image
[57:28] to now worship no grieving image
[57:32] now so when god gave them
[57:36] the order to build embracing separately
[57:38] this is what i want you to watch now
[57:43] it was
[57:44] it was a symbol
[57:49] of his word
[57:53] it was pointing
[57:55] to the word
[58:00] praise the lord
[58:03] amen
[58:05] god
[58:07] god
[58:09] is an object of worship
[58:12] amen
[58:14] if that object do not have a base in the
[58:17] word is idolatry
[58:23] you you're grabbing the concept
[58:26] amen
[58:28] praise the lord
[58:34] if we will come
[58:35] and uh and and and uh uh uh and and and
[58:39] kneel down to the altar you know like
[58:41] brother branham says he says he says uh
[58:43] uh uh uh people you know he says uh you
[58:46] know uh uh he was correcting something
[58:49] that people think that i have problem
[58:51] against auto call
[58:53] see people ask questions he says brother
[58:55] brahm you say you say auto call is
[58:57] catalyzing
[58:59] he said no
[59:02] i believe in autocall
[59:05] but not just the form of the people just
[59:08] coming to the altar
[59:12] of the way
[59:14] that the catholic church make the altar
[59:16] to them
[59:18] praise the lord
[59:19] but people
[59:22] bringing their house to god
[59:25] so whether they come to the altar or
[59:27] they sit in their seat
[59:29] and they can be able to open their heart
[59:31] to god
[59:33] they will get the same result
[59:38] [Music]
[59:41] praise the lord
[59:44] amen
[59:45] so when the people
[59:47] uh uh
[59:48] uh
[59:49] will no longer
[59:53] approach god
[59:55] if your heart and mind is no longer
[59:58] after god and he had just go into that
[1:00:01] brazilian serpent because uh uh you know
[1:00:04] uh uh enter went there last week she got
[1:00:07] healed and and and and brother also his
[1:00:09] foot was broken they took him there he
[1:00:11] got healed now it is just all noun
[1:00:14] just the brazen altar is no longer
[1:00:17] almighty god that healeth our diseases
[1:00:25] so when it starts becoming an idol
[1:00:29] then god is no longer in it
[1:00:36] praise the lord
[1:00:38] then god is no longer in it
[1:00:44] praise the lord
[1:00:52] hallelujah
[1:00:59] let's read second king
[1:01:03] second kings
[1:01:24] second king chapter 18 let's read from
[1:01:27] verse one and it came to pass in the ten
[1:01:29] years of hosier son of eli king of
[1:01:33] israel
[1:01:34] that hezekiah the song of ahaz king of
[1:01:37] judah began to reign
[1:01:39] 25 years old
[1:01:43] he was when he began to reign and
[1:01:46] and he reigned 29 years in jerusalem his
[1:01:50] mother name
[1:01:51] also was ivy
[1:01:53] the daughter of zechariah
[1:01:56] and he did that which was right in the
[1:01:59] sight of the lord according to all that
[1:02:02] david
[1:02:03] his father did he remove the high places
[1:02:07] and break the images and cut down the
[1:02:10] growth
[1:02:11] he break
[1:02:12] in pieces the brazen serpent
[1:02:15] that moses has made
[1:02:19] for all
[1:02:20] for unto those days the children of
[1:02:22] israel did burn insane onto it
[1:02:27] praise the lord
[1:02:30] amen
[1:02:34] now they were not
[1:02:35] uh making sacrifices unto the lord
[1:02:38] anymore
[1:02:40] the brazen serpent has become their god
[1:02:46] praise the lord
[1:02:48] they could not go past the brazen
[1:02:50] serpent
[1:02:54] they could not see that god just used
[1:02:57] that as a symbol
[1:02:59] and all that he was speaking about
[1:03:02] as moses lifted up the brazen serpent so
[1:03:06] the son of man will be lifted up that's
[1:03:08] all he was speaking about
[1:03:14] praise the lord
[1:03:15] trying to trying to point them trying to
[1:03:19] give them a vision of what he would do
[1:03:21] but they couldn't see that far
[1:03:27] are we together
[1:03:30] praise the lord
[1:03:33] so this this brazen separate now has
[1:03:35] become a complete idol they are burning
[1:03:38] incense they are bringing food they are
[1:03:41] they are offering gifts and and and
[1:03:43] everything you know when and and people
[1:03:46] having a little bit of that in their
[1:03:47] house exactly the way it is they kiss it
[1:03:50] before they go to bed it has now become
[1:03:52] a god in the camp
[1:04:01] praise the lord
[1:04:02] now so we see hezekiah year
[1:04:05] he break the whole thing in pieces
[1:04:19] and the generation will go
[1:04:21] and gradually
[1:04:24] as a young people starts to grow up
[1:04:26] they're no longer saying the brazen
[1:04:28] serpent is growing away from their mind
[1:04:31] praise the lord
[1:04:33] they are some uh you know there are some
[1:04:35] there are some people that really had
[1:04:37] they really had a supernatural
[1:04:40] experience in that brazen serpent it's
[1:04:42] just hard to leave them
[1:04:44] and we have to go with them to the grave
[1:04:50] praise the lord
[1:04:52] because i was i was dying my i mean i i
[1:04:55] had cancer i was i was my
[1:04:58] body was rotting when it took me to that
[1:05:00] place i just lifted my eyes
[1:05:03] i wish you were alive to see it
[1:05:06] i wish you were alive
[1:05:10] it used to be right right on that
[1:05:12] mountain
[1:05:16] praise the lord
[1:05:24] but a god that is always mindful of his
[1:05:26] people
[1:05:29] year he gave them another provision
[1:05:33] and this time is the moving of the angel
[1:05:36] on the water
[1:05:40] praise the lord
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:44] you see that's the reason why uh
[1:05:47] you know
[1:05:48] brother branham has has has always had a
[1:05:51] special place in his heart for medical
[1:05:53] science
[1:05:57] because just like how god provided a
[1:06:00] brazen serpent
[1:06:01] the brazen serpent was their clinic
[1:06:05] it was their medical center
[1:06:09] praise the lord
[1:06:11] amen it was their medical center yeah we
[1:06:13] raised in john chapter five there were a
[1:06:15] bunch of people lying just they were
[1:06:17] lying on on on the show
[1:06:20] before the porch and waiting for the
[1:06:22] angel to move it just like people at the
[1:06:24] hospital waiting for the doctor to come
[1:06:27] and call their names that was their
[1:06:29] clinic
[1:06:38] that's the reason why the prophet god
[1:06:40] said that's you know that's he says that
[1:06:42] is the thing that is the right thing a
[1:06:44] normal person would
[1:06:46] go to see your doctor
[1:06:48] because it's not the doctor that heals
[1:06:50] is god that heals
[1:06:53] but you see it's an institute that god
[1:06:55] has bless
[1:06:59] is god's provision
[1:07:02] he brought us here
[1:07:05] just like he took care of two million
[1:07:08] people in the wilderness
[1:07:13] praise the lord
[1:07:16] that's the same way that he has made
[1:07:18] this provision
[1:07:22] amen
[1:07:24] now so the the brazen serpent i mean the
[1:07:28] the the the uh uh the pool
[1:07:31] there the
[1:07:32] uh uh uh
[1:07:35] what's now
[1:07:37] the place where god was blessing the
[1:07:39] people saw the angel moving upon the
[1:07:41] water and someone got healed
[1:07:47] praise the lord
[1:07:49] and they have had experience they have
[1:07:51] had experience they have hard experience
[1:07:53] and and year by year then and people
[1:07:56] have got experience i mean until uh
[1:07:59] those that was welfare they paid people
[1:08:02] to stay right there and and and take
[1:08:05] care of the uh the the sick people
[1:08:08] praise the lord
[1:08:11] if you can throw him in the water
[1:08:13] and he be the first one i will raise
[1:08:15] your wages
[1:08:19] praise the lord
[1:08:24] so just like how you are working double
[1:08:26] there were people that were working
[1:08:27] double
[1:08:33] there were people that were also working
[1:08:34] overnight
[1:08:37] because maybe the angel could come
[1:08:38] overnight
[1:08:45] are we together
[1:08:50] now and they stay there and then you
[1:08:52] know and and you know and and here is it
[1:08:55] now the the very god
[1:08:58] that was also healing them on the basis
[1:09:02] of moses commandment look at the brazen
[1:09:04] serpent it was not the brazen serpent
[1:09:07] that was healing it was the commandment
[1:09:09] of god that was healing
[1:09:13] there was nothing in the brazen serpent
[1:09:15] to heal
[1:09:16] it was what god said
[1:09:19] look and live
[1:09:22] obedient to that that was what was
[1:09:25] giving them their healing
[1:09:33] praise the lord
[1:09:34] but you see there were people that went
[1:09:36] to the brazen serpent
[1:09:38] they were looking
[1:09:40] but they were still not getting healed
[1:09:47] praise the lord
[1:09:50] because they were doing it
[1:09:53] in in in worship of the brazen september
[1:09:55] not in obedience of god's word
[1:10:03] is the obedience to god's word that
[1:10:05] brings the result
[1:10:11] is the obedience to god's word
[1:10:14] that brings the healing
[1:10:16] it's not uh
[1:10:18] uh uh the pills that we take is not the
[1:10:21] touching of the doctor's hands
[1:10:24] is the obedience to god's word
[1:10:27] i'm the lord that healeth all
[1:10:29] they are diseases
[1:10:32] praise the lord
[1:10:34] and god because you say said in
[1:10:36] obedience to your word
[1:10:39] i would do that
[1:10:42] i wanted to share something
[1:10:44] with you now that i'm i'm in this
[1:10:48] i hope i see it here
[1:10:51] praise the lord
[1:10:54] hallelujah
[1:11:04] i was actually going to take it on on on
[1:11:06] something i wanted to talk about
[1:11:10] but what what actually it is is the
[1:11:12] other
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:23] brother brandon was out hunting
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:32] he was out hunting
[1:11:36] and then there was uh
[1:11:40] there was one of
[1:11:41] the brothers that were out hunting with
[1:11:43] him
[1:11:49] i actually took this because i wanted to
[1:11:53] i wanted to show you uh
[1:11:57] uh
[1:12:03] the same as we are talking about
[1:12:21] so he's hunting and then this brother
[1:12:24] this family have one of their boys you
[1:12:27] will get the story on tape
[1:12:30] that was suffering from
[1:12:34] epilepsy one of his trip dead in british
[1:12:37] columbia
[1:12:40] hunting with brother ed bisco
[1:12:43] and uh and when they told brother
[1:12:45] branham
[1:12:47] he said
[1:12:49] now this is it's a complete scriptural
[1:12:51] principle
[1:12:52] and i i will i really wanted to take it
[1:12:54] and just do it on there and show you
[1:12:56] something
[1:12:57] but now that is that it's on my on my
[1:12:59] mind let me just let me just share that
[1:13:01] with you and then maybe another time so
[1:13:04] uh he told them and said uh well
[1:13:07] uh the next time
[1:13:09] that the that this boy ever had
[1:13:12] the epilepsy
[1:13:14] take the shirt that he's wearing
[1:13:19] take the take his shirt off him and
[1:13:21] throw it in the fire
[1:13:27] now
[1:13:27] you have to realize that
[1:13:31] uh the scripture says
[1:13:33] from the body
[1:13:36] of the apostle we're taking aprons
[1:13:43] okay
[1:13:44] from the body of the apostles were
[1:13:46] taking aprons and they were they were
[1:13:48] laying on the sick and they were healed
[1:13:51] now so it's it's it's more
[1:13:54] of the place
[1:13:56] of where
[1:13:58] uh uh
[1:14:03] yeah i i never wanted to go into this
[1:14:04] but we are already in it so we'll just
[1:14:06] go amen
[1:14:08] praise the lord my mind is now wearing
[1:14:10] in different directions
[1:14:12] praise the lord
[1:14:13] now so you see it even even in the way
[1:14:16] that uh faction designers
[1:14:19] you know design clothes
[1:14:22] and uh
[1:14:24] sometimes
[1:14:25] they have setting
[1:14:27] uh a person in mind
[1:14:30] you know this close is you know is is
[1:14:32] like this person how they call them a
[1:14:35] lady gaga or whoever you want to call
[1:14:38] and uh
[1:14:41] but what it represents
[1:14:44] it represents
[1:14:46] the the spirit
[1:14:48] that is behind that
[1:14:52] amen
[1:14:54] praise the lord the spirit that is
[1:14:57] behind there now so uh uh uh we we know
[1:15:01] we deal with that when we were speaking
[1:15:02] on the message inspiration we know that
[1:15:05] uh the apostle paul uh uh took that when
[1:15:09] when the sheminar woman went to elijah
[1:15:13] praise the lord
[1:15:15] and elijah took his staff and gave it to
[1:15:18] geheza to go and lay it on the baby
[1:15:21] praise the lord
[1:15:23] now what does that represent is that
[1:15:25] uh because he's a prophet of god he's
[1:15:28] always in the presence of god he's
[1:15:31] always praying so it has to do with the
[1:15:34] atmosphere
[1:15:37] the atmosphere
[1:15:39] praise the lord
[1:15:41] amen
[1:15:42] so during the time of the revival all of
[1:15:45] those prayer clubs were kept in an
[1:15:47] atmosphere though the claws were cut
[1:15:50] into pieces they were kept in an
[1:15:52] atmosphere where the prophet of god
[1:15:54] would go and pray over them they were
[1:15:56] kept in a garlic atmosphere
[1:16:02] because it's not the cloth that brings
[1:16:04] the healing
[1:16:06] is god's promised word
[1:16:11] praise the lord
[1:16:15] are we together
[1:16:17] now so the same thing also with this
[1:16:19] sick child
[1:16:23] because when he when he gets vexed when
[1:16:26] when that when that spirit possesses him
[1:16:29] he gets this and whatever he's doing now
[1:16:32] that spirit that is that is now
[1:16:34] tormenting the body is is also it's in
[1:16:37] the atmosphere
[1:16:40] praise the lord
[1:16:42] it's in the atmosphere so brahms says
[1:16:44] the next time it happened take his shirt
[1:16:46] off him and just throw in the fire said
[1:16:47] i do this that's what he said say i do
[1:16:50] this
[1:16:51] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:16:59] what is that bringing it back to the
[1:17:00] word because it's the word that brings
[1:17:03] the result
[1:17:09] if you are not doing it in the name of
[1:17:11] the lord jesus christ then you are doing
[1:17:14] another other worship right
[1:17:21] are you grabbing the picture are you
[1:17:23] grabbing the sense of what it is amen
[1:17:32] most of the time the same thing
[1:17:35] uh adores in medical science that's the
[1:17:37] reason why when the patient leaves the
[1:17:39] bed the first thing they want you to do
[1:17:41] to go and take all the sheets and go and
[1:17:43] wash it
[1:17:46] praise the lord
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:51] if the same thing in hospitality when a
[1:17:54] person sleeps in the room they must go
[1:17:56] there and clean the room take the sheets
[1:17:58] off the bed and go and wash it
[1:18:09] how did i find myself here i don't know
[1:18:17] now so
[1:18:18] you see the the
[1:18:21] the
[1:18:26] but yeri said now jesus
[1:18:33] the same god
[1:18:34] that was healing them
[1:18:36] through the brazen serpent the same god
[1:18:39] that was moving
[1:18:40] upon the water
[1:18:43] has promised
[1:18:45] that a virgin shall conceive
[1:18:49] amen
[1:18:52] he has promised that i would tabernacle
[1:18:55] myself among men
[1:19:00] praise the lord
[1:19:01] and that same god has stepped among men
[1:19:08] and he's moving
[1:19:11] he's healing the sake
[1:19:14] praise the lord
[1:19:17] amen carrying on great healing revivals
[1:19:20] someone going to bury their dead and
[1:19:22] they pass through jesus wait and he
[1:19:24] stopped
[1:19:25] and look at the mother crying
[1:19:28] he said young man wake up
[1:19:31] praise the lord
[1:19:38] but this is the principle
[1:19:40] of richard staying
[1:19:43] hiding the idol of her father
[1:19:47] with all of that that was happening
[1:19:50] because
[1:19:52] the angel moving of the water
[1:19:55] has been
[1:19:56] the move of god or has been the way that
[1:19:59] god has been healing his people
[1:20:01] supernaturally
[1:20:03] even though they were all healing
[1:20:05] revival and people were talking about oh
[1:20:07] he opened the blind eye oh he did this
[1:20:09] and
[1:20:10] they were stuck to death
[1:20:15] praise the lord
[1:20:16] even when jesus told that man pick up
[1:20:19] your bed and walk
[1:20:21] the next day people came back to the
[1:20:23] pool
[1:20:29] praise the lord
[1:20:31] they came back to the pool waiting for
[1:20:33] the angel to move upon the water
[1:20:43] praise the lord
[1:20:46] so you see the uh uh uh that's that is
[1:20:49] the principle that i was trying to bring
[1:20:52] out of there
[1:20:54] now
[1:20:54] but that's the scriptures in john 5 19
[1:20:57] that that we've been kind of for dealing
[1:20:59] on here with the harmony of the father
[1:21:01] and the son so but jesus now is now
[1:21:04] saying
[1:21:05] you know he tell the man pick up your
[1:21:07] bed and walk
[1:21:10] and the bible says
[1:21:12] immediately a man that was bound down
[1:21:16] with uh with with uh whatever demons
[1:21:19] that were holding the bible said
[1:21:20] immediately he took his bed
[1:21:24] praise the lord
[1:21:25] now think about it why didn't the people
[1:21:29] rejoice
[1:21:30] while they're in all those pharisees and
[1:21:33] and suffer keeping people said this is
[1:21:36] the sabbath day god has healed somebody
[1:21:38] on the sabbath day oh praise god
[1:21:41] why didn't they rejoice
[1:21:50] they say hey you you know that today is
[1:21:52] the sabbath day why are you picking up
[1:21:54] your beard
[1:21:58] why are you picking your bear where are
[1:21:59] you going
[1:22:02] he says no
[1:22:04] him that told me i will be whole say i
[1:22:06] should pick up my bear who told you that
[1:22:10] well this is a man that could not barely
[1:22:12] stand up
[1:22:14] he couldn't walk right he couldn't live
[1:22:16] right
[1:22:18] praise the lord
[1:22:19] instead of rejoicing in his healing
[1:22:26] praise the lord
[1:22:28] they're asking all these technical
[1:22:30] questions
[1:22:34] because it's it's it's completely
[1:22:37] contrary
[1:22:39] to the way their church is set up
[1:22:44] completely contrary to their doctrine
[1:22:46] this is the sabbath day
[1:22:50] they're eating the healing of a man that
[1:22:52] was bound for 30 plus years never even
[1:22:56] rejoiced the people
[1:22:58] because they are bound in their creeds
[1:23:03] religious prison
[1:23:05] is the worst prison
[1:23:09] a man can be
[1:23:13] you see that's the reason why when the
[1:23:16] preaching of the world comes
[1:23:18] it comes to free us in our spirit
[1:23:23] because the most place we are in prison
[1:23:26] is inside
[1:23:31] praise the lord
[1:23:32] we might look free
[1:23:34] on the outside and try to put up a
[1:23:36] little smile
[1:23:39] and life with the neighbor
[1:23:45] praise the lord
[1:23:48] even that did not move the people
[1:23:54] yeah i seen who is this man
[1:23:56] the man made jesus go and see no more
[1:23:59] the worst will come upon you he went
[1:24:01] quickly out of excitement
[1:24:04] he went to meet him come and see it it's
[1:24:05] jesus
[1:24:07] sure he said okay now we find a person
[1:24:09] to persecute
[1:24:14] we find a man now to persecute call the
[1:24:16] council he's breaking the sabbath even
[1:24:19] on the sabbath day
[1:24:21] why couldn't they see that he was the
[1:24:22] lord of the sabbath
[1:24:26] amen
[1:24:27] why couldn't they see it
[1:24:36] and sometimes we build a a big
[1:24:39] expectation in our mind
[1:24:42] and we can see god in the simple things
[1:24:45] when we learn to start appreciating god
[1:24:48] dealing with the hearts of our young
[1:24:50] people picking up their bible to read or
[1:24:52] even
[1:24:53] saying the prayer
[1:24:59] praise the lord
[1:25:01] we want them to have the holy ghost and
[1:25:03] be on fire but they have to start from
[1:25:04] the birth
[1:25:07] they have to start from at birth
[1:25:10] we cannot be expecting a blast when
[1:25:12] there is not a birth
[1:25:20] praise the lord
[1:25:25] asking jesus
[1:25:27] and he said i do nothing
[1:25:30] except that wish my father
[1:25:33] have shown me
[1:25:38] praise the lord
[1:25:41] amen
[1:25:44] that's oh wow that now and now he's
[1:25:47] making himself god
[1:25:50] where is god that heals
[1:25:53] why couldn't they see it
[1:25:57] there is god that is able to free a man
[1:26:00] that's been bound for 38 years
[1:26:03] why couldn't they see it
[1:26:19] so you see every time
[1:26:22] every every time every move of god
[1:26:26] every move of god
[1:26:29] even though the church of england
[1:26:31] rejoice in the father they are not they
[1:26:33] are not catholic church anymore
[1:26:36] but yet they are left with the idol
[1:26:39] of catholicism
[1:26:42] praise the lord
[1:26:45] they are left with the ideal of
[1:26:46] capitalism
[1:26:56] glory be to god
[1:27:00] amen
[1:27:02] now so you will realize the other
[1:27:04] uh
[1:27:12] brother branham speaks about
[1:27:17] our birth
[1:27:19] our natural birth
[1:27:22] he says our natural birth came
[1:27:25] from the earth with eve and the serpent
[1:27:29] praise the lord
[1:27:32] amen
[1:27:33] and and most of the time it's like that
[1:27:37] when the person
[1:27:39] gives their heart to the lord
[1:27:43] we have uh
[1:27:44] that that affection
[1:27:47] with
[1:27:48] the the first ministry
[1:27:50] that impresses us
[1:27:54] the pastor
[1:27:57] that baptized us
[1:28:00] the one that preached the gospel and
[1:28:02] really explained the godhead that really
[1:28:05] convinced me to give my heart to the
[1:28:06] lord that first impression
[1:28:14] praise the lord
[1:28:16] amen
[1:28:20] the serpent had an impression on eve
[1:28:27] it goes with our falling nature
[1:28:42] i would say we are born just like rachel
[1:28:45] leaving her father house
[1:28:47] we leave the womb with our idol
[1:28:53] praise the lord
[1:28:57] that pride nature
[1:29:00] it came from the serpent in eve
[1:29:04] the lying tongue
[1:29:07] came from the seven and ever
[1:29:14] and rachel
[1:29:16] all through her journey
[1:29:18] we struggle with her idol
[1:29:21] sure
[1:29:23] because jacob
[1:29:25] don't know about it
[1:29:36] praise the lord
[1:29:39] amen
[1:29:41] check up on those about it
[1:29:44] oh that's the reason why you know when
[1:29:46] when we go and visit churches
[1:29:48] you know you sit there you listen to the
[1:29:50] music you you listen to the preacher
[1:29:53] and then your favorite preacher comes to
[1:29:54] your mind your pastor comes to your mind
[1:29:57] now he's not preaching like brother
[1:29:59] warren
[1:30:04] praise the lord
[1:30:07] that's the way our that's that's the way
[1:30:09] himalaya we are made
[1:30:14] that's the way humanly we are made
[1:30:22] but you see we have to destroy that idol
[1:30:28] we have to destroy that idol and and and
[1:30:31] and and and be and be attached to the
[1:30:34] world
[1:30:38] you see that's when brother branham says
[1:30:40] you know what
[1:30:42] i i mean if you don't believe the mayor
[1:30:43] respect his office it's on the basis of
[1:30:46] the word
[1:30:48] you are respecting the word
[1:30:50] you see that's what brings the blessing
[1:30:56] it's whatever we do in words or in these
[1:30:59] as much as we are doing it through the
[1:31:01] word
[1:31:02] we are doing it by the commandment of
[1:31:04] the word that's where the blessing is
[1:31:10] if it is not coming through the word
[1:31:12] then it's just becoming an idol
[1:31:24] praise the lord
[1:31:26] now you go back to genesis 31
[1:31:29] the scripture says
[1:31:30] jacob
[1:31:31] called
[1:31:32] his wives and they were about to leave
[1:31:34] he says now we have to leave a father

[1:31:50] that my father our father will not even
[1:31:52] give us anything of his
[1:31:56] inheritance praise the lord
[1:31:59] so then she goes and take her
[1:32:01] inheritance
[1:32:06] she take an idol for for her inheritance
[1:32:10] and she hated

[1:32:30] he says and that is that place that we
[1:32:32] should keep under the blood

[1:32:38] have that place
[1:32:44] amen
[1:32:48] some this is just it's just lying tongue
[1:32:52] yeah i mean they struggle with it
[1:32:58] just saying the truth is is just i mean
[1:33:01] they plan and everything and they don't
[1:33:04] even know how they tell lies
[1:33:06] they just run in their blood
[1:33:11] praise the lord
[1:33:15] some i mean
[1:33:17] i mean they don't see they just take
[1:33:19] things

[1:33:25] i just took it i'm going to carry back
[1:33:27] anyway i'm going to carry back
[1:33:30] i just i just took it
[1:33:34] and they're talking to themselves nobody
[1:33:36] talking today i'm saying i never saw it
[1:33:39] i just i just took it
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:49] praise the lord
[1:33:51] and i mean we can go in different ways
[1:33:53] i'm just i'm just kind of for painting
[1:33:55] that tonight so you can you can be able
[1:33:57] to drive but i mean you can get right in
[1:33:59] there and see which idol you came with
[1:34:01] amen
[1:34:06] you see which idol you came with
[1:34:13] praise the lord
[1:34:14] and do you realize
[1:34:18] that even richer
[1:34:21] in the hour of death
[1:34:23] giving birth to her son
[1:34:26] she still had to fight
[1:34:28] the struggle with her idol
[1:34:35] that's the battle you have
[1:34:41] that's what the holy ghost is giving for
[1:34:43] to empower you
[1:34:45] to destroy that idol
[1:34:49] because it's in your bloodstream
[1:34:51] you don't come to the message and it's
[1:34:53] just gone
[1:34:55] praise the lord that's what i want to
[1:34:56] come to tonight
[1:34:58] before we close here
[1:35:03] it's just good when god brings things
[1:35:05] out amen
[1:35:07] kind of a struggling to bring this to
[1:35:08] you tonight but uh
[1:35:10] thank the lord brahma says here in the
[1:35:12] message presuming i was i was just
[1:35:14] reading
[1:35:15] uh listening to to the tape
[1:35:18] a couple of them he says this he says
[1:35:21] he says now i'm going to teach on the
[1:35:23] subject of presuming
[1:35:26] it's just presuming and webster says
[1:35:30] to presume
[1:35:32] is to venture
[1:35:35] without actual authority
[1:35:38] now you have to know that we don't have
[1:35:41] no other authority
[1:35:43] if it is not based on the world
[1:35:47] so anything that you are doing that is
[1:35:49] not based on god's word
[1:35:52] you are venturing
[1:35:54] god is not going to back you up
[1:36:01] are we together
[1:36:08] venture without actual authority
[1:36:11] or
[1:36:12] to take it for granted
[1:36:16] now that was the that was the thing that
[1:36:19] hit me
[1:36:21] because that exactly what we do
[1:36:25] we take these things for granted
[1:36:31] praise the lord
[1:36:33] rachel say after all is my father's idol
[1:36:39] and she's and she's sitting right there
[1:36:42] sitting on the idol the bible says she
[1:36:44] sat right on it
[1:36:46] and told her father you know
[1:36:48] you know that it is this time of the
[1:36:50] year for me as a woman
[1:36:52] she's sitting right there and jacob is
[1:36:55] saying search for it the person you find
[1:36:57] her with let the person die
[1:37:00] and she's sitting right there
[1:37:03] why she didn't speak she never spoke up
[1:37:06] because she took it for granted
[1:37:18] praise the lord
[1:37:26] and uh that's that's the thing
[1:37:30] that kind of forget with my heart just
[1:37:33] just in couple of days here while we
[1:37:35] were away
[1:37:38] and i was just oh my god i was just
[1:37:40] thinking oh
[1:37:42] where have we come to
[1:37:44] sure
[1:37:45] where have we come to
[1:37:47] we have we have we have we have taken
[1:37:49] things for granted until
[1:37:52] i mean the world has creeped in not only
[1:37:55] creeping
[1:37:58] but it have it's it's swollen us up
[1:38:02] swallowing the church up
[1:38:06] until those things that used to matter
[1:38:08] no longer matter to people
[1:38:20] and this message brother brad i'm crying
[1:38:22] to the church and saying he said well i
[1:38:24] mean
[1:38:25] where's your prayer life he says you
[1:38:26] have taken fasting out of the church
[1:38:28] what's the all-night prayer meeting and
[1:38:30] he just crying to the church and you
[1:38:32] know just just just rebuking the people
[1:38:42] but we have taken things for granted
[1:38:47] until
[1:38:50] we have placed ourselves in social
[1:38:52] condition
[1:38:55] that we enjoy
[1:38:59] the story of the supernatural
[1:39:02] just when it is still
[1:39:05] and there is nothing in us
[1:39:07] wanting to experience the supernatural
[1:39:16] praise the lord
[1:39:33] he says that's why the word
[1:39:35] presumed means
[1:39:38] go without authority or just taking it
[1:39:42] for granted
[1:39:47] and that's how these people also fall
[1:39:50] into idolatry
[1:39:52] because they took it for granted
[1:39:55] until the mist they missed the spiritual
[1:39:58] application they missed the real reason
[1:40:00] why god raised up a brazen serpent why
[1:40:03] god troubled the water
[1:40:17] praise the lord
[1:40:24] we'll stay on that talk tonight
[1:40:28] and see if the lord will
[1:40:31] bless it as we prepare our house to pray
[1:40:47] i mean that guard will be
[1:40:49] doing something
[1:40:52] a divine healing
[1:40:54] heal the man
[1:40:56] and it will not grab the attention of
[1:40:58] the people
[1:41:01] praise the lord
[1:41:05] amen
[1:41:06] that it will not grab the attention of
[1:41:08] the people
[1:41:10] that this must be god
[1:41:21] and i'll say it for
[1:41:23] for disassembling
[1:41:29] to see that
[1:41:33] we still have our doors open
[1:41:37] praise the lord
[1:41:38] amen
[1:41:43] and the wednesday night service
[1:41:47] it used to be a tape service for just
[1:41:49] two three persons
[1:41:51] we can come together tonight
[1:41:53] praise the lord
[1:42:01] let's not take this for granted
[1:42:05] praise the lord
[1:42:08] it has to be god
[1:42:12] that is moving right here on sister 900
[1:42:18] it's not a man it's god
[1:42:21] because i believe that tears and prayers
[1:42:24] have gone into this place
[1:42:30] but what happens
[1:42:32] when
[1:42:33] god starts to move and bless the people
[1:42:36] then they take it for granted
[1:42:40] they come to church if you want to
[1:42:43] sure
[1:42:44] they don't yeah i mean they don't care
[1:42:58] praise the lord
[1:43:00] i mean the age is going in in in such a
[1:43:04] way i was just thinking about it this
[1:43:06] morning as as i was meditating and just
[1:43:08] it was just kind of a blasting on my
[1:43:10] mind and saying uh you know uh one of
[1:43:14] the biggest biggest money-making thing
[1:43:16] in our age is advertisement
[1:43:20] this age is an age of advertisement
[1:43:25] that's one of the biggest thing that is
[1:43:26] making money
[1:43:29] that's what has made zach a millionaire
[1:43:32] because he built a platform called
[1:43:34] facebook
[1:43:35] and it's all advertisements
[1:43:38] he get a bunch of people working for him
[1:43:40] that he's not paying the damn
[1:43:43] and all the money going in his pocket
[1:43:47] on a few
[1:43:50] that really knows uh how to get their
[1:43:52] money is getting out of him
[1:43:55] but that's that's the age that we are
[1:43:57] living
[1:44:00] it is the time it's the season
[1:44:04] praise the lord
[1:44:07] i mean if you if you if you if you get a
[1:44:09] product you get a little product like
[1:44:11] this a bottle of anointing or you really
[1:44:14] want to sell you better get a site to
[1:44:16] put it on
[1:44:19] and if you can get aside and just get
[1:44:20] everything set up you can get people
[1:44:23] buying it from india they can buy it
[1:44:24] from everywhere that's that's the world
[1:44:26] that we are living in
[1:44:29] that's the global village
[1:44:34] praise the lord
[1:44:38] but we have to also realize
[1:44:43] that the devil
[1:44:46] make use
[1:44:48] of every move of every opportunity that
[1:44:51] has ever come to the world
[1:44:53] when it was an industrial age he make
[1:44:55] use of it
[1:45:00] praise the lord
[1:45:05] he used there to break
[1:45:07] a a family he used that to break morris
[1:45:12] because we may have to get out to work
[1:45:16] so because it was an industrial aid they
[1:45:18] have to they have to dress like the
[1:45:20] dress code for the job
[1:45:22] right
[1:45:23] they took it for granted
[1:45:27] and
[1:45:28] now
[1:45:30] when you see the dress on the woman
[1:45:33] you say to yourself she's a sister
[1:45:38] he said wow that's a sister there
[1:45:42] why because they took it for granted
[1:45:56] brother branham says
[1:45:58] that was the place of the ephesian
[1:46:00] church age
[1:46:01] that least got that moment
[1:46:07] on god at moment he said
[1:46:14] praise the lord
[1:46:16] now remember
[1:46:18] as i close tonight
[1:46:30] rachel she was the beloved wife of jacob
[1:46:34] the one that jacob loved

[1:46:41] a type of christ
[1:46:46] she was the mother of benjamin
[1:46:48] the one that times the 144 thousand
[1:46:51] at the love of the father
[1:47:03] she is the type of the church
[1:47:08] right from the time that
[1:47:11] god called our father
[1:47:14] abraham
[1:47:16] he came out of mesopotamia
[1:47:20] from the land of babylon
[1:47:25] praise the lord
[1:47:30] idolatry
[1:47:32] has always run in parallel
[1:47:37] praise the lord
[1:47:39] that's why let's let's not take things
[1:47:41] for granted
[1:47:43] when things

[1:50:29] church church of the living god that
[1:50:32] represent the body of jesus christ
[1:50:45] and all
[1:50:47] that matters to the people

[1:50:52] and brought a random picture on the
[1:50:54] other side
[1:50:56] we are in the message we are going to
[1:50:58] the rapture

[1:51:06] amen
[1:51:10] i don't force against none of those
[1:51:12] things
[1:51:17] but if we have all of those things there
[1:51:19] and we don't have the word
[1:51:24] we have just built another grieving
[1:51:26] image for ourself
[1:51:30] if we will not come back to the world
[1:51:33] we will not have the effect of the word
[1:51:35] in our homes and the effect of the word
[1:51:38] in our life
[1:51:39] if the world will no longer break our
[1:51:41] conscience
[1:51:44] the people would do things
[1:51:46] claiming the holy ghost
[1:51:52] when when when when the early church was
[1:51:54] a church of shamefistness
[1:51:58] this last this church is a bold-faced
[1:52:01] church
[1:52:04] she have she have both face she can tell
[1:52:07] lie bowling
[1:52:11] without a bling of an eye
[1:52:17] she can come right from out there
[1:52:19] out of worshiping her idols right out of
[1:52:21] the house of adultery and come and take
[1:52:24] god's word
[1:52:31] when early christians gave their life
[1:52:33] blood

[1:53:15] and god will be speaking to your heart
[1:53:19] don't take it for granted
[1:53:25] you better take that thing back to the
[1:53:27] lord in prayer and say god

[1:53:37] life

[1:53:42] it was a stone that was caught out of
[1:53:44] the mountain
[1:53:46] without hand that was what broke that
[1:53:48] image
[1:53:49] of babylon down and it would take the
[1:53:52] stone the revealed word of the hour
[1:53:54] god's word
[1:53:55] to break every form
[1:53:57] of idol in our lives
[1:54:01] people come with their denomination or
[1:54:03] idol that it's it's just a mindset the
[1:54:06] same way those people are stuck to
[1:54:07] worshipping uh the brazen

[1:54:14] they are just
[1:54:15] you just they are just stuck in that
[1:54:17] mindset

[1:54:25] them no i can be part of it
[1:54:31] the body of jesus christ is a mystical
[1:54:34] body

[1:57:50] that he was a church head messenger he
[1:57:52] came he did his work he went before him
[1:57:54] even we knew that he was a messenger
[1:58:07] let us not presume people
[1:58:12] let's not venture
[1:58:16] like we read
[1:58:17] on that quote
[1:58:20] but branham says
[1:58:22] the bride she was not she will not do
[1:58:23] anything until it is the word
[1:58:26] that is the authority that we stand on
[1:58:28] in this hour
[1:58:32] praise the lord is the authority that we
[1:58:35] stand on in this hour
[1:58:38] to wait for the rapture
[1:58:40] we have to be standing on the word
[1:58:43] because it's that power that will
[1:58:44] rapture us
[1:58:46] is that power that will lift us up from
[1:58:47] here
[1:58:54] if it is not the word
[1:58:57] you are on your own
[1:59:03] you need the mercy of god
[1:59:09] people just just presume because you
[1:59:11] know because it makes sense
[1:59:14] it makes sense it sounds right
[1:59:17] praise the lord
[1:59:31] but think about that tonight
[1:59:34] praise the lord
[1:59:36] may god give us grace
[1:59:40] hallelujah
[1:59:43] whatever we came out with as our idol
[1:59:47] may he give us grace for us to break it
[1:59:50] praise the lord we have the privilege
[1:59:52] not to be like rachel
[1:59:54] we can tell
[1:59:56] our jacob cries
[2:00:00] that this is this is my idol christ
[2:00:03] i brought this thing out in my in my
[2:00:05] first birth
[2:00:07] this thing is what is bothering
[2:00:13] amen

[2:00:20] what happened if rachel
[2:00:22] said to to jacob
[2:00:27] i was the one that took the idol
[2:00:35] but we can say to our jacob
[2:00:40] amen
[2:00:44] this is what was handed down to me at my
[2:00:46] birth
[2:00:48] i came into the word telling lies like
[2:00:50] david said
[2:00:52] born is saying in iniquity
[2:00:55] lord this is my struggle
[2:01:00] lord i'm struggling in this area i need
[2:01:01] your grace
[2:01:06] praise the lord
[2:01:08] just like rachel said to her husband one
[2:01:10] time
[2:01:13] she said
[2:01:14] give me child
[2:01:16] right
[2:01:18] praise the lord she was she was brought
[2:01:19] she was i mean we can say the same thing
[2:01:23] to our our jacob
[2:01:27] now i only ask him
[2:01:29] for the gifts and the blessing
[2:01:31] but we can also ask him for our
[2:01:33] struggles
[2:01:35] we can take our struggles to him
[2:01:38] we can take our weaknesses to him
[2:01:41] and don't take them for granted
[2:01:47] musicians you can come tonight

[2:02:14] i must tell jesus
[2:02:16] blessing their courage tonight

[2:03:28] [Music]
[2:03:39] solo
[2:03:44] [Music]

[2:03:58] jesus

[2:04:08] [Music]
[2:04:10] jesus

[2:04:59] must have
[2:05:01] jesus
[2:05:04] oh yeah
[2:05:06] jesus
[2:05:08] can't
[2:05:11] help me
[2:05:14] jesus
[2:05:22] one of the reasons why god had to curse
[2:05:25] the second and break every bone in his
[2:05:27] body because god had to destroy that
[2:05:30] image
[2:05:31] it has such an impression on eve if god
[2:05:34] did not destroy it
[2:05:36] there was a possibility of it repeating
[2:05:38] itself
[2:05:40] and that's the reason why god has to
[2:05:42] destroy the separate break every born in
[2:05:44] his body
[2:05:47] change his form
[2:05:48] [Music]
[2:05:49] and that's the same thing that the holy
[2:05:51] ghost comes and does
[2:05:54] it comes down and and then he says that
[2:05:56] you
[2:05:57] you're baptized with the holy ghost and
[2:05:59] fire
[2:06:00] fire consumes
