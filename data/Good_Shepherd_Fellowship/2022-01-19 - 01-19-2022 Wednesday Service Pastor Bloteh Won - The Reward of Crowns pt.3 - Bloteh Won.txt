ill they are back home in tennessee praise the lord amen brother george preach for us sir last wednesday he brought us to the tabernacle amen i thought we were in church but he brought us to the tabernacle amen after we got to church he took us to the tabernacle but it's going to be in the house of the lord let's take the by our bibles tonight amen thank you musicians praise the lord that should be first corinthians chapter three that should be first corinthians chapter three tonight we'll rehearse a little bit the last convenience service we use uh uh we already structured and went over a little bit of this now you have to remember now from the beginning of the year we we started with crossing over into our inheritance you know crossing over jordan into our inheritance and uh and then since then we've been speaking on rewards and i want to be like that evangelist that brother branham talks about and when they ask him you don't you have no other message beside repentance he said well unless the people repent unless we see repentance we're not going to stop amen so unless we get a hold of our reward our inheritance then we might stay on this praise the lord but i'm just trying to trust in the law to be able to use this and just just to to help us to realize that you have to remember now that salvation is a gift it's a free gift nothing you have to do you just have to accept it it's a free gift praise the lord if you accept the lord jesus christ and what he have done for you on the cross of calvary and accept god's free gift of salvation is a free gift but when it comes to reward is is completely different we will see some few things tonight is completely different um [Music] to each of the church ages there was a reward that was given to them there was a reward that was given to them and because of uh how can i overcome brother branham express a little bit of that because of the age that we are dealing with this evil age and the spirit that are in this age that have come from all the ages god has rewarded this age or promised to reward this age that he that overcome will sit with me which means god we have a reward to have a domain to come to a place of rest praise the lord like none of the ages has come to and the thing that is bringing us to rest is how much god has revealed himself through his word to us in this age if we can just take the word and apply the word to every situation we will definitely find rest praise the lord so to every age you find that even uh well let me not keep you standing let me not keep you standing praise the lord that's first corinthians chapter three let's let's take our our bibles here and let me let me just let me just get get a little background here so you will see it will help us to be able to see let's read from verse one and our brethren could now speak unto you as unto spiritual but as onto khanna am i reading from first corinthians chapter three one okay okay most of the time i'm out i could not speak unto you as unto spirituals but unto canon even as unto babes in christ i have failed you with milk and not with meat for heather told you were not able to bury it neither yet now i need iea evil okay let's go ahead four-year ayet khanna for whereas there is among you envy strive divisions i in that cannon and walk as men for why i won't say i'm of apollos and another i'm of paul and another sign of apollos i ain't not connor who then is poor and who is apollos but ministers by whom you believe even as the lord gave to every man i have planted apollo water but god god is the one that gave increase so then neither is he that planted anything neither he that preached the word is anything amen neither he that water it but god that is able to go down there and cause that seed to dramatize god that is able to bring the world to pass in your life it's not whether he can preach mystery or i like the way he can preach they have nothing to do with it is the result of the seed is the quickening of the seed he is the one that quickens the seed and until he quickens it it's going to lie in the earth and it will it will just be the dormant all dead but it's god that quickened he gave the increase now so see see where the apostle paul is coming with this with this conversation now he that planted and he that water it i won and every man shall receive his own reward and we've been talking about reward now i want i want i'm trusting that the law will bring us bring us to a place where we will realize how much this is important do you know how many christians people that believe even around the message all they think about is just going in the rapture and do you know that the ones that will not taste death is also a reward it's not for everybody it's not for everybody we get we'll get into there we trust that the lord will help us here so paul here is bringing us to the place and the one that planted the one that watered god bless you have you seen as we continue to read every man shall receive his own reward by calling to his own labor amen for we for for we are laborers together with god ye are god husbandry yeah god's building a calling to the grace of god which is giving unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another build it there on but let every man take he how he built their own for all the foundation can no man lay no main lane that's the reason why it do not benefit us to establish ourselves in the hearts of the people it do not benefit us because you cannot lay any other foundation that is already jesus christ is the chief cornerstone anything contrary to that is not going to stand i don't care how i try to impress you or is not going to stand it might be sustainable for a while god will cause something to happen he will cause something to happen just so he can get the man out of the way and that's the that's the reason why many earnest man has come to the place that the various people that raise him up are the same people that turn around and despise him there is no other foundation can no man lay that is laid which is jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold savor precious stones three natural elements three god-given elements praise the lord now see now paul from the very beginning he starts saying that we are just work it is god that does the increase now so he's bringing three god-given elements gold saver and precious stone that is given by god then he's taking three also that man can produce wood hill and and stable a man had to cut a living tree down to make a wood out of faith he has to you know gather the the the herbs and out of there to make a hell out of faith and all of that so three are men men and three are god-given six is the number of men so paul takes six elements that represent man and man is caught right in between there where he has the grace of god on one side and he also have his human element he can either fall on the side of the grace of god or he can use strain energy bill his name whatever it is just is just human element are we together every man work shall be may manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire now most people think about this and they think about hell fire no that's not hell fire it's not hellfire you have to remember our god is a consuming fire this is not hellfire paul is now talking about hell fire yet he's trying to bring now see the position of the corinthian church right at the beginning of the book paul praised these people how is known that the gifts are among you spiritual gifts i am on you but yet you are connor are we together amen we can say the same thing about us we we we we have been given the gift of god in this age the message of the hour the greatest move of god on earth but yet there is a lot of canality with us because we have taken attack and think that we are better than other people and we just take a name every man work shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every work of what sought it is if any man's work abide which he has built there on he shall receive a reward now you put fire on gold gold is going to stay you put fire on savor silver is going to stay you put fire on precious stones it's just going to be more precious i put fire on wood this house is going to burn down please don't try it amen is there any sound out there becomes that no fire in here think about when god came down and and uh and visited manoa and his wife and after the brawl the sacrifice you know uh saw this man the angel of the lord and uh and abroad you know sacrifice and food and whatever and god came down in the form you know of of a fire you know and and consumed the sacrifice and and and right in the midst of that the angel of the lord you know and uh uh manoa and his wife said we have seen the lord so that is the way that god is dealing with us i'm trying to to trust the law to find a way to to go about this now if any man works about he he uh which he have built there on he shall receive a reward but i'm not bad if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss brother branham says there are many that will be disappointed he shall suffer lust he shall suffer regret but he himself shall be saved the salvation is already there because the salvation is a finished work praise the lord but he's going to suffer lust he's going to be disappointed are we together but he himself shall be saved yet so by fire amen which is the baptising of the holy ghost now see how paul is going to move this now it's good for us to read our bible knowing that that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any man defy the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye ah you know what i'm trusting the lord i'm trusting the law that this subject will bring us to such a dedication amen it will bring us to a place of dedication that just like how solomon dedicated the temple and the presence of god came down we will begin to dedicate our body to be able to experience the presence of god in our body praise the lord now let's go back let's take solomon temple see the history of the temple the temple that was built just look at the history the temple was built or the temple came true an act of adultery david and bert sheba an adam for adultery a murder a murder was committed uris died then solomon that built the temple went into idolatry but yet out of that god was able to raise up a temple amen he was able to raise our race of a temple and because of the way it was neatly joined together and the order that was in it he felt so pleased that since the day of moses amen when the people saw the the presence of god on the mountain the lightning the fire and all of that since that time god has not been so visible to his people to come in the congregation of israel but just imagine that god was able to raise up a temple from murder from a state of a man that killed a man for his wife idolatry and lies and and and and and all of that that's the temple we are that's the temple you and myself are god is building a living monument from the robbers of sin lies they have run down in our family in generation but yet he's going to raise up a temple where he's going to be two feet on the earth he's going to get a man a body would not prepare me praise the lord now he says he moved right from reward and then he jumped to you your body don't you know that your body now why the paul did that why he did that is to bring some sense of consciousness to us first corinthians chapter five let's go to verse chapter 5. praise the lord now in chapter 5 that's where he did with the with the living let me let me let me keep myself together a year before uh i just throw things apart and uh okay second corinthians chapter five that's where i wanted to go we get to our subject tonight i'm just trying to to lay a foundation second corinthians chapter five now verse nine let's take verse nine verse 9 wherefore we liber now you're talking about the same label that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him amen that word i i just located this this evening pleasing that word accepted means to be pleasing amen that god will be pleased with us praise the lord now that there was you know like people would say king broad rotting apple and rotting tomatoes that's that's that's a lie he brought the first fruit of his harvest amen amen he brought the first fruit of his harvest but yet god was not pleased amen because it is it's from the same channel now it's it was all from his work it was all from his labor his effort but king by evil sacrifice was from a thought within abel's sacrifice came from something within his heart by faith abel offered a more excellent sacrifice so his sacrifice were pleasing to god because it was something that came from his heart not from his hands are we together just follow me now wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ now this scripture also throw people off many believers says no this is not for us because then they are believing christ has passed from death onto life there is no condemnation no judgment but this is the the the word used here is completely different from the white throne judgment followed let's let's follow now let's follow the thought of what the holy spirit is ministering to us here for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the things done in his what body body now connected back to first corinthians 3 your body is the temple your body is the temple what was god's purpose to make man in his image that was a spirit man and god would come down and take the dust of the earth and and build a body what was the purpose of that it was not for all that we think it is amen it was not for us to you know why i i i i i i don't know how to call it now it was not for us to uh do whatever you know like you know make ourselves uh pretty handsome you know we're not supposed to be like rascal in a way we're not supposed to be uh you know you're supposed to have a presentation that when someone see you and you tell them you are a christian they say i know you were because there was something the way you present yourself you look like a gentleman you look like a young decent woman that's the way we're supposed to be but the purpose of god god had a purpose to make a body he had a purpose the purpose was for his expression paul says we are made for his purpose for his pleasure for god to express himself so this body is given to us and what we do in this body we will be rewarded for it what we do in this body we will be rewarded for it when god gave you a trial in this body and you are able to rightly carry that trial out not looking for who to blame and who to will to cast it on but you are able to say beard unto me now calling to your word lord i don't understand it but i know you are in this i know you're using this to build character in me [Music] you will be rewarded for that job was rewarded he never did anything to be sick but god was using him as a testimony to a lying devil that there is a man born of woman that can be able to stand for god on the earth so every man we give account of what you allowed to happen in this body sometimes we become you know we we the church must be a sacred place but you see people put a lot of sacredness on this building and they forget about this one they can abuse their body with thoughts and things and then when they come to church i refer to danny henry in prophecy over brother branham what was that the choice that he made the difficult path that he choose the prophecy was a huge portion of heaven and whistling because of the choice that you make his choice that he made to stay with the word of god not to join no denomination stay even if he's rejected wealth for we must all appear before the joshua seat this joshua seat is just like jesus before pilot it's called the beamer seat it's a seat of you know where people are are rewarded what a good or bad they are they are giving the reward it's just that the term joshua seat make many to think that is the white trunk judgment no we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he have done whether it be good or bad the thing that he have done in his body knowing net that your body is the temple of god the thing that we have done in our body praise the lord i pray that the lord will help us tonight let's just read something here and then we can we can be able to start up are we together let's read a dream from the sixth heal but branham say our dream about a month after that i was i was standing one day and i was watching the great time now not not the judgment now not the judgment i don't believe the church ever comes to death i mean the bride goes to a judgment you see you see what he's trying to place here amen so i don't believe that you know but i was there when the crowns was being given out so the whole thing about these crowns that we are talking about is rewards praise the lord see great big throne set up here and jesus and the recording angel and all was standing there and there was a stir step like coming down this way of white ivory run down in the cycle praise the lord and i was standing back way back on one side and i was just standing there never an idea i had to walk them steps i was standing there and i did see a recording angel who called a setting name and ah i recognized that name i looked and way back there here come the brother walking or the sister walking up here like that recording injured now you see the the thing of head there it is the other there there there are a lot of these things they are the you know the dreams and and the visions you know the trains of brother branham you know that that the lord allowed him to experience but you see uh [Music] sometimes these things happen to to a believer it happened to a man you know uh just like brother branham talks about that uh uh 42-inch boat that he was going to kill and and the bed that he was going to shadow so and all of that and and he had that and he went out there you know and you know and he got the animal and he talked about the man with the checkabout shirt turned out to be brother l biscuit and all of that and brother branham kept asking the lord uh what was the meaning of this you know what what was the meaning why he had this dream and god never told him what it meant now you see the thing there is that it was not just about uh having a dream and a coming to pass but god had a purpose and the the only reason because behind the that dream about the bulldog out of that the reason behind it is that brother branham was going to loss one of the closest person in his life his mother he was the first child he saw how his mother suffered they had to move from time to time and things that she have to do verbatim talks about how he will go and hunt and his mom would just take the you know the the stomach of the the animal in little pot to faithful for them and prepare the rest for him to go and sell just to be able and she was very close to him he was not close to his dad because his dad talked that you know he was you you know he was different he was successful he would not drink you he was not a real branham but he saw his mother bringing all of those children in all the things that she went through and his mother was going to pass and god was not going to give him a vision or a dream god was not going to tell brother branham that his mom was going to pass because it's some of the things that is just hard to bear brother branham lost his wife and his baby he almost blew his own head off he held an electric cable he said if he was not god i was going to be i was going to fry to death and because that was going to happen god gave him a dream a vision about the bull with the exact horn exact measurement that god will show him the exact measurement of the horn god told him about the bed god told him about a a boy that had a checkable shirt and to brother branham what a dream is this and it was not just a dream like like any ordinary dream because god stamped that dream with his seal that thou said the lord you will not just shoot a boat but you will shoot a board with this exact measurement now one inch less now one inch longer now so god will do those things and the reason was to be able to comfort his prophet that i will never leave you i will never forsake you just another way to say i will never leave you i will never forsake you when brother brandon mother was passing he did not believe it he never believed that his mother was going to die because he said the lord never told me he was preaching the message the comforter when he called him it was right on the pulpit preaching when his mom passed right after the service he had to run to the hospital mama was gone and brother branham now started asking god lord why you never told me you told me about other people why you never told me then god reminded him you remember the vision i gave you about that board about that bed it was for this particular moment children we are serving a god that created the heaven and the earth praise the lord you can be smarter than god praise the lord i heard somebody say god says come walk with me just like he told the prophet praise the lord he told his disciple follow me but he just don't want us to be behind because we could last he want us to be by his side he don't want us to be ahead of him either he don't want you to be behind him he wants you to walk with him now so your brother band is having another dream remember brother branham visit behind the curtain of time it came from one of those moments where he's lying down and thinking lord every time i'm over 50 years old you know thinking about all of this and brother branham confessed that he was he was afraid of death and his fear of death is that uh he never wanted to be a floating spirit because he always thought that when men die you know they they just keep floating around he said that's that was his thought you know until god gave him that visit behind the curtain of time to make him to understand i know man is not just a spirit man we have a body that we go into praise the lord and he's sitting there and have his hand behind his head and say lord and and uh you know what what would become of meaning you know then all of that and then you know god give him a visit the life of a prophet is not a life that you can search on google is not a life that you can search on google the life of a prophet is not alive that a man that is still struggling with loss and lies can explain [Music] it's not a life that you can find on youtube either may god give us grace let's get back to our subject of reward your brother ben say i was standing back and way back on one side and i was just standing there never had an idea i would walk up the stairs i was standing there and and i see the recording angel who called a certain name and and and i recognized that name in a look and way back there here comes the brother walking all the sister walking yeah like that they recorded an angel standing there by the side of christ just a dream now and was watching and their names was on there it was it was found in the book of life he did look out over them and said it was well done my good and faithful seven now enter in i look back where there was going there was a new word and joy and said enter into the joy of the lord that's been your sense the foundation of the word all are taught they go through there and meet one another and just rejoicing and going over the mountains and the greek and and the great places i thought oh isn't that wonderful praise the lord can you feed a wonderful feeling i don't know about you but i'm feeling wonderful [Laughter] i'm beginning to feel wonderful [Laughter] oh thank you jesus thank you jesus oh my goodness it looks like we have a refrigerator under this puppy the water gets cold here so i drink it to help my voice and it makes my voice sound cracky amen it's okay glory hallelujah just jumping up and down then i think yet another name called it will say oh i will say oh i know him i know him i watch him right enter into the joy of the lord my god he says oh i said praise god praise god just thank him just like they will say omen evil you know he you know try to bring a name and then i did say that's omen evil there there he is and here he comes out of the crowd goes up i hear him say enter into the joy of the lord that's being prepared for you since the foundation of the word enter in and omen evil just change and just start back in there just streaming and hollering boy they just shout and say glory to god standing over here by myself having a wonderful time amen watching my brethren go in and a recalling angel students said well and brandon i never thought i did have to walk that so then i was scared and i thought oh my will i have to do that so so i went walking down there and just everybody petting me um like that hi brother branham god bless you brother branham pardon me as i go through a great big crowd of people and all of them reaching over petting me like that god bless you brother god bless you brother i was going and i said thank you thank you thank you like coming out of a meeting or something you know and i was going to have to walk these great big average steps i started walking up through there and just as i made my first step i stopped and i thought i looked at his face and i thought i want to get a good look at him this way and i stopped i had my hands like this and i fell something slip in my arm here it was somebody else's arm i look around and there's two hope those big black eyes and dark head hanging down her back white robe looking up i mean like that i said hope i've had something hit this arm look around and there was media that dark house looking up and their black head hanging down and white rob and i said media and they look i want another you know i got them in my arms and here oh i woke up i got up i sat down in the chair and i cried you know i thought oh god i hope that comes like that both associated with me in this life and bringing children and things like that and here we are walking into the new world oh my where perfection in everything why is going to be a wonderful thing don't miss it don't miss it by the grace of god do all you can and then it will be up to god to take care of the rest of it don't miss it do i still have time to preach don't you just feel like going home praise the lord i lost the sense of preaching now you know you see that brother brown says you know well when god called a man god called his wife it's not only for the ministry you know this is it's our life you know when uh the people that god associated us with even in the ministry you know the pastor the day comes the men that stand close and support the ministry grab the vision you know the ones that clean the church the ones that you know do everything they can you know for that body this is a body you know uh uh and and all of that and and uh uh so yeah brother branham in this dream you know uh uh uh had the privilege to be able to see how you know the the uh the two sisters that were associated in his life you know uh uh bringing him into a setting place in his life and and all of that uh yeah i can i can go on and go on but uh it will i would kind of lost track tonight so let me just take the last two minutes praise the lord amen you know these two meanings i can be like joshua tonight stand still two minutes wait for me to finish preaching before you get over to the next two minutes stand still praise the lord amen and you see that's the reason why we have to be very careful we have to be very cautious we have to examine ourselves we have to look at our motives and our objectives in the things that we do in the things that we do it's not he the race is not to the swift he's not he the wrong past this other person and ron you know all of these rot race things you know that we think about we want to be better than this other person we want to be better than this other person we get so caught up in this carnality none of those things count to internal glory none of those things count it's only the things that is done for god that last praise the lord it's only the things that is done for god that lasts i feel like preaching but i'm going to stop tonight i feel like preaching if you allow me we can preach all night because i have laid a good foundation i've got you to the place where i can nail through your soul and you will not even feed it the place i've got to you right now i can put a nail down your soul and you will not feed it because i have captured your spirit already but let's just
