We pray that father oh God you will cause your face to shine upon him and may you bless him and father bless his ministry and we pray that more than ever before you will take the center stage in his life and prosper him beyond leaps and bounds. My Mary is due to travel the first week of next month for her for her daughter's memorial. We commit her journey, Father, into thine hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you will carry her safely and bring her safely back. &gt;&gt; Father, she is in your arms of love. &gt;&gt; Guide and protect and deliver her father in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our brother Bobby Wes has passed away. We commit the family into your hands. We pray that you will give them strength in this time of difficulty and just minister unto them beyond what human words could ever do. We want to thank you for little Olivia that is not feeling very fine. We pray that you'll go and minister healing unto her this moment &gt;&gt; and give her strength. We pray pleading the blood of Jesus upon her. Father and father we pray oh God may you break every yoke of the enemy that may be hanging over her life and let your glory fill her life in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Come take complete control over as many of us that have gathered before you and father minister unto us according to our needs. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; I owe God one testimony. Praise the Lord. And probably I should start with that. A check was issued in my wife's name last week and I were just shredding things and normally when a letter lies down too long and I take it, I don't even care what is inside. I just put it through the shredder. So I took this and for some reason I opened it. Even when I open I wasn't so satisfied and something said just look. When I looked, it was a check that was written, a genuine check of $800 and something dollars. So I showed it to her. She said, "No, I wasn't expecting this." I said, "It's a genuine check." She said, "Okay, let's keep it and call the people on Monday." So we kept it over the weekends. And I said, "No, there is no reason keeping it. It's genuine. We are going to cash it." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I started looking for it. I couldn't find a check. We turn everything everything upside down in the house. We couldn't find a check. &gt;&gt; I put it in a folder. Everything in the folder was there. Things I didn't need. But the very thing I needed the most was not there, which was the check. So we went praying and I promised God when I find the check, I will come and testify to it. The following morning, Gaswell came down because I I sleep in the living room. And we said, "Go, I've been looking for a check. Did you see any check?" He said, "No." And then the mother said, "Just stretch this chair and look under." I said, "No, I did that twice already." And then when he stretched the chair, I mean the chair and looked under there was nothing. I said, "Mommy, there is nothing." The mother said, "Come and take this flashlight and look down there." And lo and behold, when he took it, it was just lined up with the side of the chair &gt;&gt; and there was no way you could see it. And she saw he saw the check. I said, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; So, we found that check. You know, when you have too much, 800 doesn't mean anything. But when that 800 is something you are depending on to do something, &gt;&gt; it's more than $8,000. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I just thank God for it &gt;&gt; and I give God the glory for it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you my wife's surgery went very very well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She sends her greetings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. when we went in fact when they came to carry her to the surgical room she was just on the bed praying I was sitting down and they came and they were telling her ma'am we have come to take she didn't even care she was not she was not listening &gt;&gt; she was just praying and they were talking to her she was just praying &gt;&gt; and then they said okay you can go and wait in the lobby when we are done we'll come and get you. I said okay. &gt;&gt; And they were healing her away and she was praying &gt;&gt; unknown to me. She was praying in even she got to the surgical room praying praying and she broke in tongues. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the surgical room and they were holding her and she was shaking and she said the rest was history. She didn't know where she ended. She just woke up and realized they had finished with their surgery. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God answers prayer. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to thank you for your prayers. Everything was very very successful. I was in the lobby. The doctor came out and called me &gt;&gt; and said, "Your wife surgery went very very well. All the paths went in perfectly well. You could see from the doctor's face how happy he was." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in fact, she is recovering at a very fantastic rate. &gt;&gt; We went to the hospital last Thursday for her physical therapy. The therapist was telling her this is the first time I have seen somebody come for their first visit and do what you are doing. It's just amazing what she's doing. &gt;&gt; And we just want to thank you for your prayers and uh God is still answering prayer. &gt;&gt; God bless you all &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Let's put our hands together for Jesus this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Serving a living and a mighty God. Amen. And uh I want to also thank God.

He had a lot to the to the ER this morning. So we promise that we pray for her and which of course goes we did at home and uh so we just we just thank the Lord. Amen. And uh I need your prayers too for strength this morning. Praise the Lord for strength this morning. We we got it we got it just a few hours ago uh from uh Turkey. We went support one of our our friend young man that visited us here year before doing their wedding. Uh so we went his dad was a good friend, very good friend. Knew him since uh 1994 95 when I moved to the A coast. He was the voice of God representative there and uh uh we had good friendship over the years. We work together but uh the father passed away a couple of years ago and u and the mother uh was not able to get her visa to come for the wedding. So a lot of his uh dad friends, they all decided to go and support him and uh so I was able to uh take a lift with brother Ariel and his wife. They were supposed to stay but then uh I told them I would need a lift back home also. So I had a copy. stay shocked and and right after the wedding uh we cut away from the reception and took the road home. So, but we thank the Lord. He granted us a a safe trip back home and it's going to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, u uh if I'm saying things, I'm not saying the word, but I might be sleeping. So, just bear with me with that one. Praise the Lord. And Uh uh the Lord has been good to us. Uh we we want to again announce uh the first weekend uh that will be the first and the second we will have the forest farmer with us and uh that weekend forest farmer has been a good friend to Mr. Assembly over the years and uh we love having him to come. Praise the Lord. Uh I promise you you will enjoy the weekend. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's uh he's a he's a good he's a nice brother. The social burden for the word of God and for the people of God. Amen. And then uh uh the Wednesday that follow after our sister Rebecca, our uncle will be passing through Minneapolis and uh so he will speak for us on Wednesday. We thought we could get him over to Grace Ministry on Thursday, but brother Don Hoffman would not be around. So we will just have that Wednesday service with him and then he will go over to uh uh Ohio to be with brother Char that weekend. So uh uh I think so far that's uh what uh we have on our plate this morning for for announcement. This morning actually I had a I had a couple of few things I wanted to speak about and uh uh but I also now want to have a long service because I don't know if my body will be able to take take it and uh but this morning my my the actual subject that was on my mind was to talk a little bit on church discipline. I was going to talk on church discipline. I'm going to go into uh um Acts chapter 5 and uh and begin from there. But uh uh since I don't want to hold you too long, uh we just I'm just going to trust the Lord this morning, I also had another thought on my heart that I wanted to to share with you. So we would just trust the Lord to be able to help us uh as we as we go in the word this morning. So, thank you musicians and uh let's just uh go right in the word as we as we will read the scripture and just ask the Lord to be able to give us a sense of direction here. Praise the Lord. Uh to be able to give us a sense of direction. I'll take uh just one out of the book of Job. And then uh uh yeah and then we will go to the book of u the acts of the apostle. Job chapter Job chapter 36. Job chapter 36. Praise the Lord. Job chapter 36. And I'll read that and then uh whether it is what we will speak from, but I will I I will just share with you a little bit. And Job 36 verse 10. Job 36 verse 10. He openeth also their ears to discipline and commanded that they return from iniquity. If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasure. But if they obey that, they shall perish by the sword and they shall die without knowledge. Father, we just want to thank you for the portion of your word that we have read this morning and uh I pray that God you would just please come and help us Lord that we will say something to your children this morning that will be encouraging, Father. And Lord God and bless us for speaking and And as we commit all of our needs in your hands this morning and uh uh sister to us uh two girls happy birthday too. Father we want to just commit them in your hands and pray that you bless them at every one of their needs. Bless those little girls. Lord Father sister ask that we lift her up in prayer this morning. We pray that God you bless Mar and just give her strength to her body. We love you Jesus. We love you father in your wonderful name. We pray with faith and thanksgiving. We remember this morning uh sister and little niece. Father, we hope that the situation gets out of control and we just place all of these things in you. You are faithful. You are faithful. We thank you. We appreciate you. In Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. And uh uh uh when we had our our church meeting, when we had our church meeting, we uh uh we spoke in terms of uh uh laboring together to be able to uh uh keep an atmosphere where God can can come in our midst and uh and be able to bless us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh and in that re and in that uh uh thought of uh laboring together to be able to keep u a goal atmosphere in our mess is some of the reason why I have u have place on my heart to to kind of a talk on this. We we have to remember that brother Brandon says that uh God disciplined his children. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God disciplined his children. And from the message of the hour, we understand also the difference between discipline and punishment. You know God is a god of discipline and uh uh punishment is for the wicked. Amen. Discipline is to be a character. So uh uh uh but the reason why I wanted to to uh to go into this you know when you when you just think about everything that is happening not only not only around our assembly but the word as a whole uh the word as a whole. Oh my god I forgot I forgot. I'll keep you for another time. There's there's there's a little video I wanted to show you. Uh yeah, I forget forget about it. That's fine. And I think the reason why I forgot about it because uh I'm I'm getting away from my uh uh uh subject that we been talking about. Revelation chapter 5. Uh Wednesday night, we were talking about the seven spirit. And it took us to look at uh the eye of God moving through and the earth. I also I also thought I will continue from there but uh this was more wearing on my heart because uh uh uh there was we were we were going to bring this subject to you and bring a matter to you but uh we will bring this subject without the matter because uh uh uh we still have to to talk some things out with the deacons. So I will I will just deal with the subject now. So u uh so with everything with everything that is that is happening around us we realize that uh our age is under such uh tremendous pressure. Amen. Tremendous pressure. And what we've been told from the word of God by the prophet of the hour is there when the Holy Ghost is leaving there will be enough demon power rise in the people on the earth and uh uh and you can see it everywhere. You know people are under pressure. You know people are under pressure. some of our our actions and reactions is all because of pressure. But uh the Lord is faithful. Amen. Be very faithful. And that is the reason why we've been kind of dwelling on that subject of the the the rider and the beast because we want to show you the the power that is that is pressurizing us for for for evil and then also show the power of God that is combating it. Amen. Because uh uh let let's be a show let's assure ourself in a sense that none of us in our physical mind we know that one can be able to stand against the enemy. None of us with all that we know about the word of God we can be able to stand. You know brother Brandham says overcoming is to know the devil by his tricks. Praise the Lord. is something that we say. But how do you know this this devil that have been deceiving? He deceived the wisest man, the strongest man, and uh uh uh uh I mean he's he's been here almost 6,000 years more than you or myself, how we can really grab him by all his traits. So the purpose of bringing their subject is to be able to show us the important one of having a messenger of having a prophet. The important of having a prophet, the important of being under a prophet ministry. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because just like we said Wednesday night and we saw it in the word of God, uh uh that's the eye of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the art of God. So it is the message of the hour that grab the enemy in his tracks. Is the message of the hour that expose to us the tricks of the devil. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because just like the scripture says, it is so close that even it would deceive the very ear. So that is the reason why you know I've been I just been going around that subject to be able to just break it into pieces and and make it a little bit simple for us to be able to understand. But that is the place where I'm coming to you know that is the place where I'm coming to is not just to show us uh uh uh colors or just to uh uh but for us to be able to see how blessed we are, how privileged we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's almost like brother Ram says that God gave his children the best weapon &gt;&gt; and that was the word. Praise the Lord. So if we if we if we see all of those things and understand it then you will know that when you leave the word in whatever way you have just exposed yourself for trouble. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When you leave the word, you have just exposed yourself for trouble. And remember the Bible says that the devil know that his time is out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He know that he does not have any time. So he's ready to throw anything at you. Anything he can get in his hands to throw at you, he's ready to throw at you. &gt;&gt; If he can just get you frustrated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he can just get you frustrated, that's that. I mean, that that just all he just want to rob you. He comes to steal, kill, and destroy. &gt;&gt; He just come to rob you. I think one thing that the devil knows there is they are the uh uh he can't change a a seed of God to a seed of the devil or the seed of the serpent. He cannot do it. &gt;&gt; But if he can cause you to be so rough that you can never enjoy this salvation that is freely given to you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you can never enjoy it. you you would just you just go from one cycle to another cycle to another problem to another problem because what he's trying to do is to destroy the confidence of God's word &gt;&gt; frustrates you so much that it looks to you that there is nothing in this Bible is truth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then uh we just become a miserable son of God or the miserable daughter of God uh uh all of our days on the earth. So that is the reason why we are we we we are dwelling on that subject and uh uh so when you look when you look all through the scripture something I was I was I was uh I was looking at uh lying down just meditating that came to my mind I was just looking at some parallel uh uh uh through the scripture and some of the things that uh that happens through uh uh uh the scripture. Now the the Bible would tell us uh uh right uh uh even right there in Eden. Let me try to find my way to this as quick as I can and uh uh just just to be able to bring something that will that can be edifier to you this morning. When the first son of God uh uh uh fell from God's principle, left God's word, God came down and brother Bon make us to know God judge sin right to where sin happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; He judge it right there in Eden and he also judge it in the body that sin was committed in. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He told Eve in pain and sorrow he told Adam you know from the sweat of your brow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So even even the even the even the white judgment when God is judging sin, it will be right back here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; On earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the body that sin was committed &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; is the body that sin will be judged in. &gt;&gt; That's right. because that's God's principle. That's what he did in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and so with that principle in mind, we can see that whatsoever we sow in this body, &gt;&gt; we will reap it in this body. &gt;&gt; Are we together? The white true judgment is not going to be in heaven. It's going to be here on earth because uh sin was committed here on earth and we will not be judged or sinners will not be judged because there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ. Are you glad for that &gt;&gt; that we have passed from death onto life. &gt;&gt; So sinners will not be judged in celestial body. sinner will be judged in the body that sin was committed. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so so uh uh uh with that in mind, I I just want to run you a little bit when you look through the principle and and what I was thinking about is that the uh the the the first evil that was done after appreciate the service last Sunday. Yeah, brother, you were talking a little bit about that going back to Eden and all of that. We know that uh uh that was uh uh that that was idolatry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Adultery was the act that was committed. But the sin was unbelief. That's why brother Brandham said sin is unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sin was unbelief because she left the word. And because she left the word, her body was now exposed &gt;&gt; to the act. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The art was the result of the scene. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So you see there all through the scripture. Another place you look at, you will see in the songs of Judah. Reuben was the firstborn. But Ruben was stripped of the birthright. He was stripped of the priesthood and and the kingship. Why? Because he committed h an abominable act. He slept with his father's wife. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And because that was done, he was stripped of those things. Now watch now in the New Testament, Paul will show us a case in the book of Corinth where there is another man in the church. That that was the Old Testament. Now in the New Testament church, there's another man in the church sleeping with his father's wife. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And Paul will ask that that thing must not be mentioned among us. That man must be excommunicated. &gt;&gt; So in in in first Corinthian he was excommunicated. In second Corinthian he had repented and he was restored to the church. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so you will see it and and another thing that that that that that grabbed my mind was that uh in in the book of Joshua, we know of Achon taking the Babylon Gam. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when he took the Babylonian garment, he hid it in his tent. And we know that that thing caused death in the camp. And it it it caught Joshua attention because honor Joshua commission God told him &gt;&gt; that I will be with you just like I was with Moses. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when those people died, Joshua called a certain assembly to find out what was going on. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So he called the people and then finally we realized that uh uh it was Achan that stole the Babylon. Praise the Lord. Now watch the principle here. Because of the wrong that that Achon did, it cost his entire family. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It cost his entire family. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When you come over in the New Testament, Acts chapter 5, I want to pick up something from there. Acts chapter 5, the Bible talks about another household, Ananas and Safar. Now I'm trying to show you a parallel of how God all through has brought some sense of discipline. &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; now? So uh uh uh in Acts chapter 5, Acts chapter 5 never never give us the full picture of whether Ananas and Sophia had children. But what we know here in the in the scripture is that the Bible says both Ananas and Safara their bodies were packed &gt;&gt; to the grave because they lied to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But what I want to show you the difference is that under the New Testament because of the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if if uh if Ananiah's wife will have come &gt;&gt; and said, "No, I don't know about this thing. I I mean, this thing is my husband." Amen. If she will have come and said the truth, the blood will have protected her. &gt;&gt; On the Old Testament, they never had the benefit of the blood like we have. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. One woman saw a Babylonian garment death run across the family. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh in in the New Testament uh uh uh this man and his wife lied against the Holy Ghost. Both of them their body was packed to the grave. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the reason why I I I I want you to see this is because brother Brandham said under the New Testament church that's the reason why church discipline we must be reminded of church discipline because he said because we are under the blood if a person is living wrong or doing wrong God will not do anything to them &gt;&gt; until the church take them from under the blood. That's why Paul had to apply that principle. &gt;&gt; Because the blood protects the body and when a person is identified with the body, baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in fellowship, partake of communion, partake of everything, you are under the protection of the church. And he says that is the reason why the New Testament church is doing poor. That's why the church is not standing in her strength. Why? Because we want big church. We want many people. So we allow everything to happen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Looks like you were not expecting this. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I myself I was not expecting it too. I I promise you I was not expecting it. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's look in Acts chapter 5. Like I said, let's look in Acts chapter 5. Let's read from verse 11. Acts chapter 5 from verse 11. Acts chapter 5 from verse 11 the Bible says and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these saints her wife that both Ananas and his wife died. Praise the Lord. Fear came upon the church and all those that here. And the Bible say verse 12, "And by the hands of the apostle where many signs and wonders wrought among the people, and they and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch." Listen to this. This is the verse I wanted to get. and the rest does no man join himself to them, but the people magnify God. Now you see because we we we we say this that you cannot join the church and it's true. You cannot join the church. The church is not an organization that you can join. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jim Setter uh help me with your friend there beside you. I don't want you sleeping now. So, uh uh uh the the church, you can't join the church. You you have to come by St. John chapter 3, the new birth. You got to be born again. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because this is the family of God. This is not an association. &gt;&gt; This is not an association. And we we want to strive not to run the church as an association. We don't want to run it by no nationality influence. Praise the Lord. People come here, they meet me most of the time when I'm around you doing something, they ask says, "So, well, is there a Liberian church?" I said, "No, &gt;&gt; this is not a Liberian church. This is a Christian church." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it was a Liberian church, we get a Liberian flag. But because it's a Christian Christian church, only the word of God we live up. &gt;&gt; It's not an association. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh so the thing about it there is that the uh uh uh the church Yeah. The Bible let us know that because of the way that God were dealing dealing with the apostles, nobody joined him. &gt;&gt; You don't join him. You got converted. &gt;&gt; Nobody dare joined him. &gt;&gt; And what what happened was there was such a presence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The people knew that &gt;&gt; you You God have to be dealing with you. You you have to you have to uh h have an experience with God. You remember Simon the sorceress when he came he saw what the apostle was doing and he he thought he could give some money to buy it. Peter say you and your money go to hell. So you don't join the church. It's not a body that you can join yourself to. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So I mean uh uh uh when we when we get to this place and you know when in uh uh uh in uh in in the same regard. We don't want to we don't want to set ourself up like uh like a like a like a c. No, we are not a c. This is not a set. This is not a c. This is the move of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the move of God where we believe that God has called us to govern our life by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, we see it all through the scripture. He's a God of discipline. &gt;&gt; He's a God of discipline. I mean, I I was I was I was lying there the other night and and I was just thinking about it. I say uh which of course I've used this in the past but it just came back as a flashback to my mind and just running those parallel all through the scripture. Judah was rob of all of his inheritance. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was robbed of all of inheritance. The the breth was taken away from him and uh uh uh uh uh uh the priesthood was taken away from him and uh and the kingship It was taken away. The priesthood was given to Levi. Kingship was given to Judah. The breth was given to to Joseph. He lost it. Now that's that's under the Old Testament. So we see here uh New Testament Paul mention of a man doing the same thing sleeping with his father's wife. He said excommunicate that man from among us. He said those things must not be mentioned among us. Those things are mentioned in the word. It must not be mentioned among us. &gt;&gt; I I will tell you something. I will tell you. I have seen how sin has ravaged church. Not only the church as a church but family it has ravaged family. It it it destroyed the lives of innocent children and before you realize it's just a a a complete abomination. And I and I would not be afraid to say those things are happening in our ranks. There are a lot of abuses that are happening in our ranks. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I believe that by the grace of God, God has called us and exposed us to a level of truth in his word to raise up the standard. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the enemy come as a flaw, God will raise up a stand up. And you are the standard of God in this age. &gt;&gt; A people that can stand for truth, stand for decency. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stand for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not telling anybody that we better than anybody. &gt;&gt; We are only saying by the grace of God. We are respecting what God's word says. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Ananas, like I said, uh uh uh uh uh their uh uh uh Achon Joshua, he stole a Babylonian garment because because they never had a blood protection. The blood of bulls and goats could not protect it. like the way the blood of Jesus Christ is protecting us. And that is the thing that that we the Gentiles are h are uh uh uh we are like Paul says in Hebrew, we are uh we we we are spitting in the face of the blood that was spilled for us. Amen. I like the way he says it. Hebrews chapter 6. Let's Let's go there a little bit. Let's go there a little bit. Like I said this this morning, you just got to bear with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; You just got to bear with me. I I hope not to keep you long, but uh uh I'm setting setting the stage here because I will have to come back to this If we don't pay attention to these things, uh it will be it will be a history that we will not want to we will not want to talk about. Amen. But if we pay attention to it and God gave us the grace to get back to to to to cleaning up our skirts and cleaning our lives, we will be proud that God help us in our generation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Paul will talk talk here. Uh uh he will speak here and says ver verse four. Let's read from verse four. For it is impossible for those for those who were once enlightened, and they have tasted of the heavenly gifts, and they were made partakers of the Holy Ghost. They rejoice in the world. Oh, it was a wonderful sermon. I felt the presence of God. They enjoy all of that. Amen. and have tasted the good word of God and the power of the word to come. That hope of a resurrection, that hope uh that gave you the desire to want to go in the rapture. You have tasted of the good of the word to come. He says, "If they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance." This is this is the thing that caught my mind seeing the crucified to themsel. They crucified to themsel. They have got to the place where they have uh reduced the word of God that the fear of God is not in them. They can say anything about the word of God. They can do anything in their life. They have crucified to themsel. You cannot crucify Jesus the second time, but you can crucify him to yourself in a sense that his word will never have effect in your life. Nobody no matter who say it to you. No matter who say it to you, it will never have. It will not move you. &gt;&gt; You have crucified the word to yourself. You can never come to repentance. You can never regret. You don't have remorse for doing wrong. &gt;&gt; It don't break your heart that you know that there are things in the world you must not do. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And this and this is a dangerous place to get because you see God he's he's the God of mercy. Amen. If you come to God and and repent and ask for forgiveness, he will forgive you. But if the desire is not in you to come, &gt;&gt; that's what happened in here. Amen. It's not that God will never forgive you, but you don't have the desire. You don't have the desire to be forgiven. You don't have the desire to repent because you have crucified the word to yourself. Nothing move you anymore. And that's a terrible place to get. King got to that place and the Bible says he wandered in the earth like a vakabone because he was not he was not even h no remorse in his heart and he's asking almighty God am I my brother's keeper the thing that gave us the desire to persevere to to come to the house of God that little thing in you that little still small voice don't kill it &gt;&gt; because you will not always have it. &gt;&gt; In the days of Noah the Bible said the spirit of God will not strive with men anymore which mean God started dealing with their hearts. The reason why you can say you can pray for forgiveness. The reason why you can cry and say, "Oh God, help me. Oh God, help me." It's not because of your strength. &gt;&gt; It's because of that little thing &gt;&gt; that God put in your heart. &gt;&gt; When it go away, there is no money that can give it to you. &gt;&gt; There is no church you can go to, you will get it. &gt;&gt; It never came by your natural birth. It came by the grace of God. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Seeing they crucified to themselves the son of God aresh and put him to an open shame. &gt;&gt; You counting the blood nothing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Counting the blood the grace of God nothing. In this very same letter, Paul says, "It's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of the living God. It's a scary thing to fall in the hands of the living." Praise the Lord. living in such a world. Uh uh uh uh you know you you you start to to to to preach these things and and say these things and uh the age classify you. You know classify you that you are running because you are not it's is it's not appealing to the culture. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I was just I was I was just sharing something with uh every last night. We were driving just talking, fellowshipping, trying to keep ourel awake. Amen. &gt;&gt; Trying to keep ourel awake. I never took toothpicks. Normally I would put toothpicks and keep my eyes open. I'm just joking. So we're trying to keep ourel awake and we're just we're just just having a good time. And I told him I say I was just thinking about this thing. You you just you just look at how how the the the morning culture is just swallowing us up. &gt;&gt; As soon we see it, we want to do it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As soon as we see it, we want to do it. And I was I was this day I was just there. I was saying, "Oh God, we ever reach to the time where wearing trousers will be normalized for our sisters. Will we ever get to that time where we will we will we will we will come to a place where uh uh a sensus that yeah you know uh uh we let me tell you all the revival in the past that have got to that place. They never knew that they would get there. &gt;&gt; They never knew that they would get there. They never knew how holiness would go away from them and they would become so worldly all because they want to appeal to the modern way of doing things. They want to be h have a popular exception to be accepted by the people. Praise the Lord. I thought about that and I says, "God forbid. &gt;&gt; God will have to shut it because he says this move of God will not be denominated." &gt;&gt; Amen. He will have to shut it. He will have to shut it. But yet those are things that are creeping into our rings. They are creeping into our ranks. Praise the Lord. The same way uh many years ago, the way family life, oh my god, you find people they were praying, praying for the Holy Ghost and fasting and praying and and they love one another, but they just felt like they were not ready to get married because they felt they did not have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I know the couple like that. They stay many years because the brother was not convinced he had the Holy Ghost. Well, anyway, it was the way he was taught. Praise the Lord. So, let me just leave that one. That's a different story. But the thing about it there is they are the uh uh but those things are no longer like that. They are no longer. We have we have uh uh uh we we we have Facebook wedding, Tik Tok wedding. Yeah. We have all of those things. A situation was brought brought before me a couple of months ago when and uh uh uh uh a brother backslided not serving God. Ruin churches ran around the sisters. Mary left his wife travel got on on the internet talking to her sister in a different country went there and the brothers never even had the grace to say let's look at this that found this man background he has a wife that he has left and he went and got married to a young virgin girl that that Malach I'm telling you people about I'm not talking about Luchian that you you will do a wedding and will not even know where this guy is coming from because he came from Dubai. Praise the Lord. No, it's true. He came from Dubai. So, it's an opportunity now. Our our daughter, our precious sister coming to go overseas. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, because we get so so in a place where we get intimidated when it looks like our church is a small church. So it looks like we must leave those things. So, so the church can grow. In as in the book of Acts, Jesus talked about the parable of the living. That was fulfilled in the in the New Testament church when the Bible talks about the 3,000 souls that were saved. That was how mixed multitude came in the church. That was how mixed multitude came in the church. Ananas and Safar, they were all part of that 3,000 that were saved. Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'm not I hope you know that I'm not mad with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that. Okay. I'm I'm not mad. It's just that uh uh I'm I'm tired. If I'm sounding angry, it's because I'm tired. I'm not mad. &gt;&gt; Truth. I'm I'm not mad with you. It's just there to uh uh that's that's what I had on my heart. You see me? I'm not even reading quotes because I'm just trying to to run you through give you the picture of what I wanted to talk about this morning. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm mad with you. a mad with the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mad with the devil. And I'm trying to say to you that we we have to we have to wake up from the dust. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to wake up from the dust. You know, I just love it because our Lord Jesus make it so simple. He said where whatsoever two or three he make the church so simple &gt;&gt; that we don't have to be intimidated if we are a small group if that what it would takes for us to stand for the word of God then let it take it &gt;&gt; then let it take it &gt;&gt; because what what is what is the need of wanting to get get a a a big church and before we realize our young children are defied What is the need of that? That we don't have word that can bring them to their knees and bring them to to to repentance and and and and and the fear of God in their heart. &gt;&gt; We just come and and and preach something and make everybody live and and let's clap for Jesus. Let's sing. Hit the music. Let's dance. Let's worship the Lord and then let's go home. &gt;&gt; How are we getting ourselves ready for the rapture? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, every every organization, every organization I was just looking at looking at a documentary just just uh right right here the uh I think it was a kind of a 19 30 something documentary uh of of New York City. And the thing that caught my eyes was you could not find one lady with trousers on. They were not Christians. They were just New York City. &gt;&gt; How come it's it's gone from us now? When you dress decent as a lady, you then you look like, "Oh, wow. Where she's coming from?" It looks like she's coming. And is is it the thing that will intimidate you? Don't you realize the grace that God has put on you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That in such an evil and adulterous age, you have the grace and courage to dress like a lady. &gt;&gt; You must be proud. You must put your face up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. family life was was uh was uh uh was cherished. They never had they never had I mean people were working for 35 cents an hour. They just how little but they I mean family life was so important. They cherish it. They spend time together. They they were happy. They have they have more children. They have more children. They didn't have money. They just have many children. But they were still happy. &gt;&gt; Now we don't want many children. We just want one or two. And we get crisis. &gt;&gt; This is a reality. &gt;&gt; What has gone wrong? Why can't we see that that that that this is a destructive spirit? &gt;&gt; Why would we want to go through the emotion of you know sharing our emotion? Oh, you know I I like you. Oh, I love you. I I mean we we do all of that and then when they put us in the house, we don't want to be in the house anymore. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be in the house. The only thing we want we want is ceremony. Everybody come, we mar down, they put us in the house. Okay, you live together. We don't want it. What has gone wrong? &gt;&gt; It must be for them, not for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have something that can keep us together. &gt;&gt; We have something that can settle our differences. It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. is the word of God and prayers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our commitment to God, our devotion to God's word. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm not mad at you again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Always say, "Daddy, why are you yelling?" I said, "I'm not yelling." Amen. So, I'm not yelling. So, so that that was what I was going to go down with you this morning on church discipline. We'll pick it off from there and uh uh we'll pick it up by God's grace and and really get into it, study it together and realize that it's for our protection. &gt;&gt; It's for our protection. If you remember many many many years ago or a few years ago not many few years ago should be uh maybe two years or three years ago I preached on a series called the bounding power. And what I took was where Jesus said whatever you bound on earth I will bound in heaven. Whatever you lose on earth I will lose in heaven. And brother Brandon somewhere said the church is losing its binding power. &gt;&gt; We are losing our b. There is something that keep us together. &gt;&gt; There is something that keep the church. The church as much as the last just few time we talked about you know uh uh uh trying to go into uh uh uh financial contribution to build a church and all that that that is beautiful. We pray that the Lord will be able to to help us to achieve that. But I'm telling you, if we don't have what keep the church together, &gt;&gt; it will be difficult to achieve that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because pretty soon we will come right back to Ananas and Sofia. And then and then money problem now will be in the house between husband and wife. you know, we get enough money and and you know, it is not we alone that are supposed to build a church and and uh but if the bounding power is there, if we see the value of of the life of Christ, we see the value of of of uh of of uh uh uh building a memorial and and and having a place where we can live together as as you know uh brothers and sisters and strive and uh uh for righteousness and truth. lift up the bonnet of Malachi 4 up. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you go back in the book of Exodus, you will realize the Bible talks about uh uh Moses building the tabernacle and how God pulled the spirit of willingness upon the people. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of willingness that built the tabernacle because they were in the wilderness. What do they have? It's just the things that the Egyptian gives them when they were traveling, but a spirit of willingness was upon the people. Praise the Lord. Now, so so you see uh uh uh uh and that's what the church hates. You study the message, you will see how brother Brandon when he use when he talks about bonding on earth and bonding, he use it more in a prayer line, challenging Satan that the word said wherever we bound on earth, so he was bounding, he was using the bounding power to keep God's children in good health. and keep sickness outside. &gt;&gt; The church can use the bounding power to keep the word inside and keep sin outside. &gt;&gt; That's what the bounding power is ging for. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's only used on an individual if he does not want to reconcile with the word or she does not want to reconcile with the word. That's that's when that is you. Then then the church use that authority to keep you outside. &gt;&gt; But it's it was it's not for the people. It's for the spirit. &gt;&gt; The bounding power is to keep the devil out of our lives, out of our home, out of the church. Are we together? So, uh, it's a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing. And, uh, I pray that the Lord will be able to help each and every one of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be able to help each and each and every one of us. uh many of us we can we can tell our testimony how we came to the Lord how the grace of God has helped us in in uh in many different situation but there we have we have children that are being born have young people that are growing up and if there's a tomorrow those are the ones that we must strive for &gt;&gt; that God will give us an atmosphere that will bring our children to birth. It will bring our children to repentance. The the the the language I was born in the message will not be their language. Their language will be I'm born again. I have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because born in the message does not work. &gt;&gt; It's a deceitful slogan. &gt;&gt; All my children are born in the message. So what Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have a generation a a an evil generation a a power that is in this age. I mean that is just that is just that that is just consum consuming the young people. Young this generation is a is a is a addict generation. &gt;&gt; Young people are just addicted to different things &gt;&gt; all different form of addiction. Science even tell looking at a documentary even even they have they even did it with even in some of the the little babies cartoon and it tells how how it works on their brain &gt;&gt; because of some of the way they they they do the things so fast trying to get the kids when they are eating babies. Is that not what Pharaoh said? &gt;&gt; Right. from two years old down killed it. And that's the that's what this spirit is doing in our age. &gt;&gt; You see the church supposed to be the place where we come to strengthen one another. &gt;&gt; When we bring our prayer request, it will not be a joking thing. People will get down on their knees and desperate and cry to God and say, "Oh, help our brother. Lord, help our sister." &gt;&gt; Because we know it's a serious thing out there. &gt;&gt; Well, if we make the church just a social gathering, we come whenever time we can come. You can't even follow. There is no way you can even trace the sequence of what is happening in church. What was preached last week? How how does it connect to what is preached today or what is preached on Wednesday night? Let's see how the Holy Ghost is dealing. You can't even connect that because the church is just a place we go when we feel like going. or not treat our body like that. We we put ourself on diet. We wash our food. We ate and all of that. But when it comes to our soul, we just open it up for anything &gt;&gt; and everything. May God give us grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; My hands are up before yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's the time that we have. We have a responsibility. We have a responsibility. When Jesus says, "I will build my church and the gates of hell will not uh h prevailed against it." The church was placed here to represent God on earth. That's the reason why Paul was told Jesus said, "Why persecute thou me?" He never met Jesus. But Jesus said Paul saw why persecute thou me? &gt;&gt; He will come to the understanding that he was persecuting Jesus by destroying the church. &gt;&gt; He will come to that understanding as God will start dealing with him. And because of that, when when he got that revelation, that thing ate that man up so much that Paul did he he he he denied himself to get married. The death of Stephen and many of the other apostle haunted him until he wanted to die for the very thing that he was trying to destroy. &gt;&gt; Say, I'm not afraid to go to Rome. I'm ready to give my life. I fight a good fight. I hope we are we we we we can take that courage to be able to give our life for the thing that has saved us. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; if it was not because of this message of the hour, some of us, we will be horrible. &gt;&gt; We will be horrible. We'll be we'll be having chains all around every part of our body &gt;&gt; from our toes. Our toes will get r ankle bracelet, knee bracelets will get pierced all over our body. &gt;&gt; If it was not if it is not because God touch our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You &gt;&gt; better give your life for the thing that save you &gt;&gt; because there's a price to pay. &gt;&gt; There's a price to pay. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this afternoon. &gt;&gt; I just want us to go to go to the Lord and pray as we talk about these things. We have dealt with spirits. We have exposed spirits. I'm not coming against no individual. I'm dealing with spirits this morning. And I just want us to go to the Lord in prayer. Musicians, you can come. Let's let's go to the Lord in prayer this morning. I don't know about you, but my hands are up. I'm saying, Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm feeling the pressure. I'm feeling the attack of the enemy.

We are losing touch with our maker. We are losing touch. We are allowing things to abuse our hearts and abuse our mind [Music] that an opportunity to speak to God with just sitting there. You don't even know where to start from. You so conscious of around you and where the next place you have to go and the time and all of that that you cannot even enter in. You can't we can't even enter in and say, "Lord, thank you. Thank you for touching my heart. Lord, don't don't take your spirit away from me. [Music] Everyone is going through one storm or the other. But where is our reality? [Music] &gt;&gt; Where is our reality? Why why come to church and we and we can't speak to the one that we have come to? We are not on speaking terms with God. We can spend hours on the phone talking the thing that concern us and not concern us the gossip and everything but we can't even spend time to talk to our maker. [Music] Where is the where is the spirit of God? It used to be where the power of God will fall among the people. They will be crying for their children. Oh God, save my children. Lord, help my loved ones. Father God, oh Lord, help this family. And they will be so moved. But we setting oursel to say we just from watching a movie [Music] and we having taints in our hearts against people. Taint in our hearts and our mind. Where is the contrite heart? What is the broken heart? Where is the broken heart? Where are the womens of lamentation? Where is the church of lamentation? Where the people knows how to just place themselves before God and say, "Lord, let my tears tell you everything. I don't have words. Let my tears say it all to you. Where's the church of lamentation? Our heart has become so hard that no matter how God try to squeeze our heart, he cannot get a juice out of our eyes. [Music] Yes Lord, please Father, precious Lord, take my hands, lead me, Lord.
