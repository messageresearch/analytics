[47:23] that the words were framed by the word

[48:54] once again it's good to be in the house
[48:55] of the Lord and God to to see the grace
[49:00] of God on your faces this evening
[49:03] and uh I want to just uh
[49:09] kind of for testify tonight I want to
[49:13] testify to that I want to uh
[49:16] yeah
[49:19] I would I was studying some time ago and
[49:23] and uh
[49:25] through the message of the rejected King
[49:28] and like I said uh when brother Brandon
[49:31] preached the rejected King when you you
[49:35] follow the message
[49:38] it's uh in in one sense it's easy for
[49:41] for you for us to look at it in and go
[49:44] back to you know uh the the
[49:51] ological view that that is out there and
[49:55] their View
[49:56] you know uh
[50:01] make us to understand the other uh
[50:09] God has always lead his people
[50:12] and uh uh and then
[50:15] he has always been the king of his
[50:17] people ruling his people he told Moses
[50:21] that he wanted to make them a kingdom of
[50:23] Praise And there's that in Exeter but
[50:27] then also God
[50:30] uh
[50:33] uh also make provision that Israel was
[50:35] going to experience different form of
[50:37] leadership
[50:38] so uh
[50:40] [Music]
[50:43] in the book of Samuel
[50:45] it shows the how Israel will get into
[50:50] this form of rejecting that leadership
[50:54] through the prophet and the people we
[50:57] want to be like the rest of every nation
[51:01] and and they will want to have a kink
[51:04] now like we said before uh
[51:08] Jacob promised that the kingship would
[51:12] come out of Judah but yet God was having
[51:16] an appointed time that he was going to
[51:18] bring his people to this place but the
[51:21] people once again like Brad branches man
[51:24] we always are in in haste so the people
[51:27] went ahead of the promise and they
[51:29] wanted a king to be like every other
[51:31] Nation so uh
[51:34] but if you look into the message
[51:38] you will realize that brother Branham
[51:41] emphasis on the rejected King
[51:43] was more in the place of the people
[51:46] rejecting the leadership of God
[51:50] being rejecting the leadership of the
[51:53] Holy Spirit he was applying there to our
[51:57] time you know that
[51:59] we are the the Sheep of his pastures and
[52:04] uh
[52:05] uh God always want us to be under his
[52:08] leadership
[52:10] so while I was I was going through that
[52:13] I came across a familiar testimony let's
[52:16] go to a rejected King I came across a
[52:19] familiar testimony and uh uh uh
[52:25] any and instead in their testimony uh
[52:29] brother Branham says here from the
[52:30] beginning the accuracy of the Holy
[52:33] Spirit
[52:35] she was that were the accuracy kind of
[52:40] for caught my mind
[52:43] it caught my mind so tonight I will I
[52:47] would like to testify it a little bit on
[52:49] the accuracy of the word of God
[52:53] how the word of God is accurate
[52:57] praise the Lord there is no
[52:59] contradiction in God's word
[53:02] amen there is no contradiction in God's
[53:06] promises
[53:08] God is accurate
[53:10] in the things
[53:12] that he does
[53:14] praise the Lord
[53:16] amen
[53:19] if you look here
[53:21] uh in in Hebrew chapter 11 Paul says
[53:25] true faith we understand
[53:28] we understand that this entire word
[53:33] was free
[53:35] by the word of God Amen
[53:38] by God's spoken word
[53:42] the entire word
[53:44] that the the universe and everything
[53:49] you know God is frame it came to Vain by
[53:53] God's word
[53:55] so God's Pocket
[53:57] and
[53:58] here we have it
[54:00] so that the things which are seen
[54:05] were not made by things we should do
[54:08] appear
[54:09] praise the Lord
[54:12] so from there we just we just want to
[54:15] encourage ourselves tonight
[54:17] that we enough we are not following uh
[54:23] uh coding device feeble like people say
[54:25] and or like the Apostle Peter said uh we
[54:29] are following uh uh fulfilled scripture
[54:33] we are following God the god that has
[54:37] spoke his word he's the one that have
[54:39] called us to believe the word that he
[54:42] have spoken
[54:43] praise the Lord so let's just look into
[54:46] their testimony again like brother
[54:47] Branham will say there are a few of them
[54:49] here that's that's what I want for us to
[54:51] look into this is a Wednesday night and
[54:54] that's all we just want to encourage
[54:56] ourselves together the accuracy of the
[54:59] Holy Spirit tell them the lady who she
[55:01] was what her name
[55:04] what her name was
[55:07] what she's done
[55:09] how she
[55:11] got hurt as a little girl told her
[55:14] the city she was from and all about it
[55:19] and when
[55:21] it went to uh
[55:25] regard her name a cohort mess
[55:31] and she was a middle-aged woman
[55:36] but she never been married just the
[55:40] accuracy
[55:41] of the Holy Spirit
[55:44] how it does that
[55:47] praise the Lord
[55:48] amen
[55:50] but branham's talking about and we know
[55:53] that that accuracy of the Holy Spirit
[55:55] was the gift of the sermon that was on
[55:58] the prophet amen and then and how when
[56:01] the prophet entered that China he would
[56:04] call people by their name and tell them
[56:07] their addresses and where they were from
[56:11] and even tell them things you know of
[56:14] their past when they were little and all
[56:17] that in Broad branches even that God who
[56:20] was so regarded and that God will refer
[56:24] to this young woman as Miss he says that
[56:27] just the accuracy of the Holy Ghost how
[56:29] he does them
[56:31] then this morning in the interview I
[56:34] suppose
[56:35] be a year uh it's a a couple missionary
[56:39] they are worse somewhere in the meeting
[56:42] I didn't get their names down here but
[56:45] they were in the interview this me this
[56:48] morning and said about some time ago
[56:51] they were in one of the meeting and the
[56:54] lady was suffering tremendously with
[56:57] something
[56:58] and her husband also and said it told
[57:02] her who she was and what she was
[57:06] suffering when told her husband what
[57:10] was wrong with him and all about the
[57:14] things that did done in life that he did
[57:18] done in their life and were they are
[57:22] calling and where their calling was and
[57:25] they was going to minister to people
[57:29] that
[57:31] wall little caps on their head
[57:35] which was Jewish
[57:38] and they were going overseas and
[57:40] everything would take place and she said
[57:43] everything just exactly the way
[57:48] it was was right
[57:52] praise the Lord amen now as as we will
[57:56] read these few quotes many of them will
[58:00] go in this same direction but what I'm
[58:04] what I'm I'm believing God that the law
[58:06] will be able to help us to grab tonight
[58:10] is that the same God that that could
[58:14] discern those people needs and could be
[58:17] very accurate
[58:19] with their names and the need in their
[58:22] life in your brother Branham saying that
[58:24] these people were missionaries and in
[58:27] the vision he told them where they were
[58:30] traveling to and even the people they
[58:32] were traveling to their same God that
[58:35] was so accurate to tell them their needs
[58:38] he's here tonight
[58:43] and he knows your need yes
[58:48] praise the Lord
[58:50] it is not just to read about what the
[58:54] law did in the life of brother Branham
[58:57] to lift the uh uh uh the prophet brother
[59:00] Branham abnormal but it is also to let
[59:03] us to know that that's in God
[59:08] is here tonight
[59:12] the same God of accuracy
[59:17] praise the Lord
[59:19] so if we look at that in the light of
[59:22] God's word then we know that

[1:04:10] praise the Lord
[1:04:13] here is this woman praying that and
[1:04:15] going you know to the meeting and now uh
[1:04:20] you know and believing that God told her

[1:04:27] uh I mean she will have number three and
[1:04:30] give her the card number 97.
[1:04:33] when God in his Divine wisdom had the
[1:04:37] prophets to start from hundred going
[1:04:39] back and she still fell on 93. praise
[1:04:43] the Lord
[1:04:45] amen
[1:04:51] you see we are in such
[1:04:54] our our present life is in such a shadow
[1:05:00] and as we read the word of God and and
[1:05:03] we get about the things that God has
[1:05:07] done and God is doing it is just like
[1:05:10] seeing the light coming in the toner
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:14] praise the Lord there is there is just a
[1:05:17] lot of things about what we deal with in
[1:05:20] everything you know is is just odd about
[1:05:23] a shot brother Brahm talks here in the
[1:05:25] message the handwriting on the wall he
[1:05:29] said then the lord gave him a dream and
[1:05:31] it troubled him he talking about King
[1:05:33] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:05:36] and when he did he saw a great image and
[1:05:41] we are well acquainted with the image
[1:05:44] and notice the accuracy of God's
[1:05:48] internal word
[1:05:50] now brother Brandon while she read this
[1:05:53] down you're going to see that brother
[1:05:54] Branham is going to take this talking
[1:05:56] about the accuracy of God's internal
[1:05:59] word and what he's going to address here
[1:06:02] is that everything that we are
[1:06:05] experiencing as political turmer as
[1:06:10] economic turmer every condition that the
[1:06:14] present word is in
[1:06:17] God addressed in Nebuchadnezzar dream
[1:06:23] the accuracy of God's internal word
[1:06:33] praise the Lord
[1:06:36] there's a big thing that is playing on
[1:06:38] the international scene
[1:06:42] Barbarian told us of different curtains
[1:06:45] he spoke about the iron curtains and the
[1:06:48] baboon curtains and the purple curtains
[1:06:51] you know uh uh and and that's that's
[1:06:54] there there are some big things that are
[1:06:56] playing on the international scene and
[1:06:58] and when you look closely in the word
[1:07:00] you know that everything that God said
[1:07:03] will come to pass just as it's supposed
[1:07:06] to be
[1:07:08] praise the Lord
[1:07:11] the prophet of God says it will come to
[1:07:13] pass that uh uh the U.S dollar with
[1:07:17] worth nothing
[1:07:21] he says because the country has gone
[1:07:23] broke
[1:07:25] now there is a big thing that is playing
[1:07:27] out there because
[1:07:28] uh uh uh uh uh with with with the
[1:07:32] alliance of of China and uh uh in in
[1:07:37] Russia
[1:07:39] and now all of these uh uh uh big
[1:07:43] Islamic countries that have been
[1:07:46] controlling or for many years are all
[1:07:49] trying to turn down to to China for
[1:07:52] business
[1:07:54] praise the Lord
[1:07:56] and if that should ever happen
[1:07:59] the U.S currency will lose its value
[1:08:05] because brother Brown said one time we
[1:08:07] were on a gold standard
[1:08:10] we had enough gold
[1:08:13] to back up the currency
[1:08:16] but Rome has taken all the gold of
[1:08:19] America
[1:08:23] praise the Lord
[1:08:26] and everything is addressed right here
[1:08:29] in that dream
[1:08:31] that God gave to Nebuchadnezzar
[1:08:35] the accuracy of God's word
[1:08:44] are we together
[1:08:46] praise the Lord
[1:08:48] now if the word of God
[1:08:51] from hundreds of years that God will
[1:08:54] give a Babylonian King a dream
[1:08:57] and that dream will speak of every
[1:09:00] Gentile Kingdom
[1:09:02] it will even speak of a spiritual
[1:09:05] Kingdom which is a stone cut out of the
[1:09:08] mountain with our man's hand
[1:09:11] praise the Lord
[1:09:15] if thou word of the Lord
[1:09:17] we address things just like it have been
[1:09:20] happening All Through the Ages
[1:09:24] can the word of God
[1:09:27] that we sit on them
[1:09:29] the preaching of the word
[1:09:31] the reading of the word the hearing of
[1:09:34] of the voice of God's prophet
[1:09:37] can it address the situation in our
[1:09:39] lives
[1:09:41] surely he can
[1:09:47] praise the Lord
[1:09:51] what I'm trying to do tonight is to is
[1:09:54] to is to show us how much confidence
[1:09:58] we need to have
[1:10:00] in the word of God
[1:10:08] praise the Lord
[1:10:15] brother Branham says nothing the
[1:10:17] accuracy of God's internal word came
[1:10:20] Nebuchadnezzar saying an image with a
[1:10:24] golden head and and the breast was here
[1:10:28] was Savor and the thought of Bryce and
[1:10:31] the feet was iron and Clay now notice
[1:10:34] how those kingdoms
[1:10:38] listen to the way he said it here he
[1:10:41] said
[1:10:42] the softest material
[1:10:45] is gold
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:51] the softer material is gold now what
[1:10:55] he's going to describe we will read it
[1:10:57] he says the softer material is gold the
[1:11:01] necks come in his father then their
[1:11:04] savior the next is bride and the hardest
[1:11:08] of all of them is iron
[1:11:11] iron is the hardest and notice how the
[1:11:14] Gentile world will start it will start
[1:11:18] so soft
[1:11:20] then just keep getting harder
[1:11:24] and harder
[1:11:27] and harder
[1:11:29] and how to tell if finally went out
[1:11:34] into a clay and iron mix
[1:11:39] and each one of those Kingdom
[1:11:43] praise the Lord
[1:11:46] not only the politics of this Kingdom
[1:11:49] even the religious condition
[1:11:53] the spiritual condition of the word
[1:11:58] it keeps getting harder
[1:12:01] from God
[1:12:03] to savor
[1:12:04] to Bryce
[1:12:07] then to iron
[1:12:12] the accuracy of God's word
[1:12:18] are we together
[1:12:23] now I think 2500 years ago a single
[1:12:27] person
[1:12:29] that purpose in their heart that they
[1:12:32] will serve the Lord and will not defy
[1:12:36] themselves foretold this they to the DOT
[1:12:42] and that was done to you
[1:12:45] amen
[1:12:49] amen got a man who purpose in his heart
[1:12:52] to not Define himself and God will deal
[1:12:56] with him and he will speak he fought
[1:13:01] told this day to the dead and every
[1:13:04] other age coming down perfectly how the
[1:13:08] Babylon the kingdom was taken away then
[1:13:11] the meeting in persons and faking they
[1:13:14] are over and Grace taking their over and
[1:13:17] Rome took it over and broke and broke
[1:13:20] into uh both feet which is easting and
[1:13:25] Western Rome
[1:13:28] and how that in Rome they did have two
[1:13:32] different churches among the Gentiles
[1:13:35] and and and and and and one will be the
[1:13:38] Catholic and the other will be the
[1:13:40] Protestant clay and iron
[1:13:43] the iron of the Roman Catholic church
[1:13:46] and the clay of the Protestant how how
[1:13:51] the Woody mixed together but who linger
[1:13:54] them sees
[1:13:56] one marrying into the other
[1:13:59] trying to break the power of one just
[1:14:02] perfectly exactly how God said it will
[1:14:06] take place
[1:14:12] praise the Lord amen amen
[1:14:16] when it seems like everything is getting
[1:14:18] is is getting out of order getting out
[1:14:22] of control we can still trust the word
[1:14:25] of God
[1:14:28] the word of God spoke about the day that
[1:14:30] we are living
[1:14:34] praise the Lord
[1:14:36] Hallelujah
[1:14:40] that's the god that we have to deal with
[1:14:45] and that has come to pass just as
[1:14:48] perfect as it could come to pass and
[1:14:51] every other promise of God's word will
[1:14:55] come to pass just as perfect as that was
[1:14:59] something
[1:15:01] will be going home to Glory
[1:15:03] someday
[1:15:05] Jesus is coming
[1:15:08] praise the Lord the word spoke about a
[1:15:11] body change
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:13] if if if the Dream came into
[1:15:16] Nebuchadnezzar show all the changes in
[1:15:19] the image from the head of gold to the
[1:15:22] to the breast of of Savior and we and we
[1:15:25] realized all of those changes and even
[1:15:27] the the word in general the Gentile word
[1:15:30] in general have experienced it from from
[1:15:33] from from the softness of God to to the
[1:15:37] take and that the toughness of iron if
[1:15:40] if the entire word can be able to
[1:15:43] experience that that was foretold by
[1:15:46] God's word how much more about the
[1:15:48] promise of God that you shall be changed
[1:15:51] your body shall be changed amen and run
[1:15:53] around will say even the word now is
[1:15:56] changing the atoms of your body
[1:16:00] as you receive the word it's beginning
[1:16:02] to change you
[1:16:17] praise the Lord
[1:16:22] God's word is accurate
[1:16:25] God's word is truth
[1:16:28] God word is powerful
[1:16:34] praise the Lord
[1:16:36] his word is powerful
[1:16:43] he holds the power of the word in his
[1:16:46] hands
[1:16:51] brother said the testimony of a true
[1:16:54] Witness
[1:17:07] he said what struck those Prophets
[1:17:10] what inspired him
[1:17:13] that perfect accuracy
[1:17:18] not only that but the prophets to what
[1:17:22] he would do
[1:17:24] the prophet even saw he born
[1:17:28] where he will be born
[1:17:31] and how he will be born
[1:17:34] not and Ordinary Baby just a baby born
[1:17:39] of some woman
[1:17:41] he said he will be born a mysterious way
[1:17:46] he will be born of a virgin a virgin
[1:17:49] shall conceive
[1:17:52] praise the Lord
[1:17:55] that's ours are your prophecy
[1:17:58] yeah
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:01] he spoke the word a virgin shall
[1:18:03] conceive
[1:18:06] glory be to God and like brother Branham
[1:18:09] says for that 700 years that one word
[1:18:12] have many interpretations
[1:18:15] people try to interpret how will it
[1:18:17] happen
[1:18:18] maybe she'll be a virgin until she get
[1:18:21] married and she'll have a child they
[1:18:22] explain it their own way
[1:18:25] but God said what he meant
[1:18:29] and he brought his word to pass just
[1:18:32] exactly what was in his mind it was
[1:18:35] going to be the seed of a woman
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:39] accuracy
[1:18:41] God's word
[1:18:44] and that same word that said a virgin
[1:18:47] shall conceive that same word says that
[1:18:51] there will be a bride
[1:18:54] amen amen there will be a bride
[1:19:02] praise the Lord
[1:19:07] so you see this uh is the uh uh we we we
[1:19:10] we have been brought forth by the word
[1:19:17] and it's not you believing God's word
[1:19:20] that makes it to to fulfill
[1:19:23] amen but God brings you to believe his
[1:19:27] word because his word he will fulfill
[1:19:29] his word
[1:19:31] when he made a promise he would bring it
[1:19:34] to pass
[1:19:35] so the word bring us forth
[1:19:38] to be able to receive the Fulfillment
[1:19:41] amen
[1:19:47] amen because heaven and earth will pass
[1:19:48] away
[1:19:50] but not one drug of God's word
[1:19:54] we ever pass away
[1:19:59] praise the Lord
[1:20:03] Brothers
[1:20:04] Prophet what inspired him
[1:20:07] that a prophet
[1:20:10] will prophesy
[1:20:13] he will name the place
[1:20:15] in birth to him
[1:20:18] out of Judea
[1:20:20] praise the Lord
[1:20:22] amen
[1:20:24] and all of these men that are that are
[1:20:26] that are are giving all of these
[1:20:28] prophecies concerning the Messiah it's
[1:20:31] not like they are sitting down around
[1:20:33] the round table and and this one is
[1:20:35] giving I I you know I say best to hand
[1:20:37] if this one says uh uh a virgin shall
[1:20:40] come see no hundreds of years apart
[1:20:46] but when it came to the Fulfillment
[1:20:48] their prophecy was dovetailing one
[1:20:51] another
[1:20:53] exactly toward the point
[1:20:56] why because the intelligence of God is
[1:21:01] behind his word
[1:21:06] praise the Lord
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:17] since we can believe the word of God
[1:21:20] praise the Lord because God's word is
[1:21:23] truth
[1:21:25] Hallelujah
[1:21:27] brother Branham saves this bride will be
[1:21:30] another she will write another book of
[1:21:33] Arts she's the continuation of the book
[1:21:35] of Acts
[1:21:36] praise the Lord so I believe that we can
[1:21:40] we can have a New Testament Church
[1:21:43] I believe that we can have we can still
[1:21:45] have New Testament believers
[1:21:48] yes sir
[1:21:51] no matter with all the the changes that
[1:21:54] are going on in the word you know
[1:21:57] and and the clouds of spirit that we are
[1:22:01] about to remember God worst Ensure
[1:22:08] are we together
[1:22:14] a virgin shall conceive
[1:22:18] one who struck a a mortar man
[1:22:22] to make him see that hundreds of years
[1:22:26] before it happened
[1:22:29] accurate
[1:22:31] exactly on the line
[1:22:34] talk about testimony of a Supreme Being
[1:22:39] a living God
[1:22:42] not only that but told where he will be
[1:22:46] born and how he will be born
[1:22:57] praise the Lord
[1:23:03] we have said that before God is not in
[1:23:05] our time
[1:23:07] he's not in our time zone
[1:23:10] right
[1:23:12] amen amen he's not in our time zone
[1:23:16] you know the scripture says
[1:23:19] Hebrew 13 8
[1:23:21] Jesus Christ
[1:23:23] the same yesterday
[1:23:26] today and forever but do you realize
[1:23:31] that that yesterday is not God's
[1:23:35] yesterday
[1:23:36] because God don't have a yesterday
[1:23:42] he's ever present he don't have a past
[1:23:47] God don't have a past
[1:23:55] praise the Lord amen now this is the way
[1:23:58] that brother Branham explain it he says
[1:24:00] what God did for Men Yesterday
[1:24:04] he can do the same today so is God's
[1:24:08] dealing with men
[1:24:09] it is not God that has said yesterday
[1:24:12] right
[1:24:15] with God he's ever present
[1:24:21] he's ever present he's out of our time
[1:24:24] zone
[1:24:25] yes
[1:24:27] that's the reason why his word can be
[1:24:30] accurate
[1:24:35] just like I said if it is like uh uh you
[1:24:38] go down to the fair and and and and and
[1:24:40] everybody is is marching you are
[1:24:43] standing at the street corner you can
[1:24:45] only see the troop as they come by
[1:24:49] the guy that is on top of the the the
[1:24:52] the House Top
[1:24:54] he's on top of the roof of the house he
[1:24:56] can see the beginning of the troop he
[1:25:00] can see the end so when he tells you the
[1:25:03] group that are coming there they are
[1:25:05] wearing red you can believe him
[1:25:08] because you and I see them until they
[1:25:10] come around the corner
[1:25:13] but he can see them when they begin
[1:25:17] praise the Lord he know where the parade
[1:25:20] started from he nowhere is going to end
[1:25:23] because he's above the the roof at the
[1:25:26] top of the house amen
[1:25:29] we are just at a certain Corner in our
[1:25:33] dispensation
[1:25:35] God is completely out of our time zone
[1:25:42] praise the Lord
[1:25:44] that's why we can be living
[1:25:46] that's why we can trust him
[1:25:48] that's why we can hold to his word
[1:25:51] because we know his world will never
[1:25:53] fail
[1:25:57] the word of God will never fail
[1:26:01] it's not only that it will come to pass
[1:26:04] but it's accurate
[1:26:06] yes
[1:26:10] he's never late he's always on time
[1:26:14] no
[1:26:15] man
[1:26:17] praise the Lord if we can only learn to
[1:26:21] rest in debt
[1:26:23] if we can just only learn to rest in
[1:26:26] that
[1:26:27] that God is always on time
[1:26:32] Hallelujah
[1:26:33] he's always on time
[1:26:37] he's exact to the DOT
[1:26:41] praise the Lord
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:45] now why would God do this
[1:26:50] that a woman will pray and believe in
[1:26:52] her heart that God spoke to her that you
[1:26:55] would get number three
[1:26:58] praise the Lord why would God do it he's
[1:27:01] doing it for you and myself
[1:27:05] right
[1:27:06] to be able to raise our faith amen
[1:27:11] amen because
[1:27:13] 97 brother Branham said she said I know
[1:27:16] I will never be called
[1:27:17] right
[1:27:19] then her faith has dropped
[1:27:25] amen
[1:27:27] we get we get on fire we get so serious
[1:27:31] and then a wind just coming past
[1:27:35] the Lord
[1:27:37] that just it shows how sometimes we are
[1:27:40] just so much in ourself
[1:27:44] we are so much in ourselves we are
[1:27:46] looking for self-edication we are
[1:27:49] looking for self-pleasing
[1:27:53] so when our boat is Rock a little bit
[1:27:59] then it looks like maybe the vision was
[1:28:02] not correct
[1:28:03] sure
[1:28:06] then our minds start going in thousand
[1:28:09] different direction
[1:28:12] praise the Lord
[1:28:14] no matter what happens
[1:28:16] you have to believe no matter what
[1:28:19] happens
[1:28:21] God word
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:25] feel just exactly as he said
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:30] praise the Lord
[1:28:33] he told his disciples he said there are
[1:28:35] some among you that will not taste it
[1:28:40] praise the Lord
[1:28:42] if God says they are there there are
[1:28:44] some that will now taste death
[1:28:47] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:28:49] they will have a body change it's good
[1:28:51] it's going to happen
[1:28:55] praise the Lord Brother man said in the
[1:28:57] message uh uh uh taking science with
[1:29:00] Jesus he said that is the reason why he
[1:29:03] says the Old Testament prophet and and
[1:29:06] the Saints the Apostle he says when they
[1:29:09] spoke about the promise of God they
[1:29:10] never put it in the future
[1:29:13] they spoke about it as it was happening
[1:29:16] in their day
[1:29:18] praise the Lord now brother Branham says
[1:29:21] uh even though in God time spent or this
[1:29:25] perception we can see that God was
[1:29:28] Worthy on the time of the Gentiles and
[1:29:29] all of that he said but when Paul spoke
[1:29:32] about the Rapture he said we that are
[1:29:34] alive
[1:29:37] amen the prophet said God Inspire His
[1:29:41] prophets to speak about his word in the
[1:29:45] present tense because God is ever
[1:29:48] present amen hallelujah God is ever
[1:29:52] present
[1:29:54] Hallelujah now so the prophet said even
[1:29:58] though they preach about the Rapture
[1:30:01] they preach about the coming of the Lord
[1:30:03] it never happened in their time but they
[1:30:07] went to the ground with an anticipation
[1:30:10] he said it is that same thing that will
[1:30:13] wake them up in the coming of the Lord
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:16] because they are even though their body
[1:30:18] die but they are fed never die
[1:30:21] amen
[1:30:23] praise the Lord so brother bring him
[1:30:26] says if God promised
[1:30:29] to to to give you anything you can
[1:30:32] believe it that you going to receive it
[1:30:35] today
[1:30:36] he says if you don't receive it today
[1:30:38] then get excited that it will be
[1:30:40] tomorrow if it does not happen it must
[1:30:43] not why
[1:30:45] what's that we we regret
[1:30:49] We Get Wicked
[1:30:51] but knowing the god that we serve every
[1:30:55] day our excitement of what God promised
[1:31:00] us must increase
[1:31:02] that if he never did it today it will be
[1:31:04] tomorrow if you don't have to answer is
[1:31:07] the next day
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:10] that's what faith must do in The
[1:31:12] Believer it must make us excited
[1:31:21] Hallelujah
[1:31:24] but we get so much capture
[1:31:28] in the spirit that we live
[1:31:32] when it does not happen it looks like we
[1:31:34] stopped talking about it
[1:31:36] because it looks like it's not an
[1:31:38] embarrassment you're talking this thing
[1:31:39] too much and it's not happening
[1:31:43] praise the Lord amen
[1:31:45] and pretty much now we we we we we lost
[1:31:49] the excitement of the promise
[1:31:53] amen we lost it
[1:31:56] but no when the promise of when God's
[1:31:59] promise is given a must make us excited
[1:32:06] Hallelujah
[1:32:07] amen if God promised that he's going to
[1:32:11] heal you you must be excited about it
[1:32:16] because as far as God is concerned it's
[1:32:20] already done
[1:32:22] Hallelujah man praise the Lord as far as
[1:32:25] he's concerned is already done
[1:32:35] that's how accurate
[1:32:38] God's word is
[1:32:40] praise the Lord amen that's how accurate
[1:32:44] every promise of God is
[1:32:47] glory be to God
[1:32:51] this is just to encourage you tonight
[1:32:54] brother Branham says a virgin shall
[1:32:56] conceive what will struck a mortar man
[1:32:59] to make him see that hundreds of years
[1:33:03] before it happened their fell in
[1:33:05] accurate exactly told the line

[1:33:11] Being a living God
[1:33:14] not only that but tall word he will be
[1:33:17] born and how he will be born toward what
[1:33:20] the word who said about him told the
[1:33:24] various signs and things that will
[1:33:27] follow him
[1:33:28] to prove he was Messiah
[1:33:32] prove that he will be rejected
[1:33:36] and even in the spirit groaning his
[1:33:39] words from the cross
[1:33:41] hundreds of years before he was born
[1:33:46] the accuracy
[1:33:47] the Perfection of those Prophets
[1:33:53] they were men of like passion
[1:33:56] but when it came to the world that God
[1:33:58] gave them
[1:34:00] it was accurate
[1:34:04] praise the Lord
[1:34:05] when it came to the world that God gave
[1:34:08] them praise the Lord it was accurate to

[1:39:21] for people
[1:39:23] that have gone on this Rabbit Trail to
[1:39:25] look for in an error they can find
[1:39:27] around the message
[1:39:31] and not counting the hundreds of lives
[1:39:37] that was blessed
[1:39:39] it was not the man William Brown and
[1:39:41] there was one called word says we will
[1:39:43] send you Elijah the prophet
[1:39:46] praise the Lord it was not the man
[1:39:48] William brought him it was God's word
[1:39:50] the accuracy of God's word God said I
[1:39:53] will send you Elijah the prophet and God
[1:39:55] was accurate to the point
[1:39:59] praise the Lord
[1:40:01] it is not what are you believe it or not
[1:40:03] that make God's word truth God vindicate

[1:40:31] that we can hold to biblical principle
[1:40:36] in the mess of a confused word
[1:40:39] we can still try to keep decency in the
[1:40:42] church because God said I will Resort
[1:40:46] the faith of the Apostles
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:50] hallelujah amen
[1:40:54] what part of Brandon says Nori I'm a
[1:40:57] human being
[1:40:59] where people take that into
[1:41:01] consideration
[1:41:02] well they take it into consideration
[1:41:05] that this man
[1:41:07] he had a wife
[1:41:09] he had children
[1:41:12] he was not an angel that just came from
[1:41:15] Heaven Come and gave his message and go
[1:41:16] back to heaven right
[1:41:28] nor in that you are a human being
[1:41:31] you have to completely Rely Upon Jesus
[1:41:35] Christ amen just completely throw your
[1:41:38] life to him
[1:41:39] praise the Lord
[1:41:42] And yet when you do all of that you are
[1:41:44] misunderstood
[1:41:47] praise the Lord yet when you do all of
[1:41:50] that you you miss understood
[1:41:57] so you see
[1:42:00] it was not
[1:42:02] brother Baron says the accuracy
[1:42:06] their perfection of those prophets now
[1:42:09] one word did they speak about him
[1:42:13] but what come to pass
[1:42:17] praise the Lord the last seven prophecy
[1:42:20] giving of him was answered in the last
[1:42:24] seven hours on the cross
[1:42:29] for every word to be fulfilled
[1:42:35] all my inspiration said his balls will
[1:42:38] not be broken
[1:42:41] and the Roma
[1:42:46] and was going to break the teeth bones
[1:42:48] he did it to the tool but when he came
[1:42:51] to Jesus because there was an eternal
[1:42:53] word an accurate word that would not be
[1:42:56] broken he put the hammer down and he
[1:42:59] pick up a spear and he
[1:43:04] praise the Lord it's the same word that
[1:43:06] says my angels I ain't come about you
[1:43:10] praise the lord it's not a fake promise
[1:43:13] it's a true Palace you can believe it
[1:43:16] that the angels of God and he come about
[1:43:18] you
[1:43:20] and because we believe that we want to
[1:43:23] keep their presence
[1:43:25] so we live a decent life you live a
[1:43:28] consecrated life you don't want to greet
[1:43:30] the oppression you want to keep their
[1:43:31] presence amen
[1:43:42] amen the accuracy
[1:43:44] of those Prophets
[1:43:46] yeah even the last seven prophecy happen
[1:43:48] in the last few hours of Jesus life
[1:43:54] what does he speak a supreme
[1:43:57] intelligence brother Brandon said
[1:44:00] a supreme intelligence a washing those
[1:44:03] men
[1:44:04] and when it comes to the message it was
[1:44:07] not William Branham no
[1:44:10] a man with a poor seventh grade
[1:44:13] education will not bring to us the man
[1:44:15] of God
[1:44:16] right
[1:44:20] it was God
[1:44:29] okay
[1:44:31] that's the reason why the best we can do
[1:44:33] is to witness to you
[1:44:35] we can force this thing down your throat
[1:44:37] God has to reveal it to you
[1:44:40] God have to make it real to you
[1:44:49] a supreme intelligence and watching
[1:44:52] those men those men were just men like
[1:44:55] you and I
[1:44:57] but they were inspired by a Supreme
[1:45:01] Being
[1:45:02] which was giving testimony that we in
[1:45:07] this generation in the generation to
[1:45:09] come and all the generation between them
