[55:02] rest of the scripture up there so
[55:04] Malachi chapter 4 then we will go to our
[55:08] PowerPoint praise the
[55:10] Lord for some reason uh these few days
[55:14] I've been I've been kind of for looking
[55:15] at end time prophecy and uh and uh I
[55:20] mean not not to not to uh uh the reason
[55:23] there is because uh I believe that we
[55:26] are following fulfilled scriptures amen
[55:29] and there are a lot of uh uh uh prophecy
[55:33] a lot of scriptures in the in the word
[55:36] that has uh that has been fulfilled in
[55:38] our day in the Major Way in a major way
[55:44] and uh uh as we as we talk we are
[55:46] talking on our last last series of uh in
[55:49] the beginning if you remember where we
[55:51] started uh uh since the beginning of the
[55:53] year we we we trying to deal with the
[55:56] last portion of it but this this uh
[55:58] caught my mind so I'm trying to bring it
[56:00] into this let's go to Malachi chapter 4
[56:03] we will read verse one Malachi 4:1 for
[56:08] behold the day cometh there shall burn
[56:12] as an oven let's see the setting of that
[56:15] scripture a day that come that burn as
[56:17] an oven when an oven Burns it burns amen
[56:22] an oven your oven at home supposed to
[56:24] bake now Burn yeah if it burn it brings
[56:27] your house down praise the Lord amen
[56:32] amen so the day
[56:35] cometh there shall burn as an oven in
[56:38] all the proud yeah all that do wickly
[56:42] shall be stubbled they shall be just
[56:44] like wood put into the fire that what it
[56:47] means and the day that cometh shall burn
[56:51] them up said the Lord of
[56:53] hosts that a they shall leave them
[56:56] neither root nor branches so everything
[57:00] going to be burned with now this give us
[57:03] an idea that this is speaking about some
[57:06] kind of uh either total judgment final
[57:10] judgment you know where everything is
[57:12] going to be burned even to the
[57:15] root are we together amen but let's look
[57:19] at the next
[57:21] verse but unto you is there a you in the
[57:25] house this morning praise the Lord are
[57:28] you are you identified with that but
[57:31] unto you unto you that fear my
[57:35] name praise the Lord unto you that fear
[57:39] my name and like I said the the tear
[57:42] commandment don't take the name of the
[57:43] Lord in vain it is not just calling his
[57:48] name his name is is uh is is is a kind
[57:52] of for
[57:53] ambassadorship
[57:55] the ambassador of America to any country
[57:58] takes the name of their country amen he
[58:01] takes the name of America to that
[58:04] country so taking on his name that's why
[58:08] we take on his name in
[58:10] baptism praise the Lord am Paul said
[58:14] whatsoever we do in words or days we
[58:17] must do it in his
[58:20] name praise the
[58:22] Lord
[58:23] hallelujah all them that take on the
[58:26] name of Christ Paul said to Timothy will
[58:28] suffer persecution so we we have take on
[58:31] his name and and here Malachi is saying
[58:34] but unto you there fear my name shall
[58:37] the son of
[58:39] righteousness the son of
[58:45] righteousness the son of
[58:50] righteousness shall the son of
[58:52] righteousness arise
[58:55] with healing in his wing wings amen his
[59:00] two wings now uh the the the prophet Y
[59:05] is
[59:07] using the Su
[59:09] n and there in the Bible this is put in
[59:13] the in in in in the
[59:15] capital the son of righteousness I was I
[59:18] was thinking on
[59:20] this arise with healing in his wing
[59:26] praise the
[59:27] Lord
[59:28] amen now so you will
[59:31] realize that uh you go back to the Book
[59:35] of
[59:36] Joshua you remember one time when Joshua
[59:40] was in a battle in all and the battle
[59:44] was was was uh uh was tense he needed to
[59:49] finish that battle praise the
[59:52] Lord so what did he do Joshua says the
[59:55] son should stand still son stand still
[59:58] until I'm done with this battle God
[1:00:01] praise the
[1:00:03] Lord and the son stood
[1:00:06] still are we
[1:00:08] together amen now uh uh the prophet
[1:00:14] Malachi yet is saying but unto you that
[1:00:17] fear my name in this time in this in
[1:00:20] this time of judgment in this time word
[1:00:24] the the whole world is going to come to
[1:00:26] a place just like an oven to be burned
[1:00:28] and everything right in that same uh
[1:00:32] period of time to them that fear my name
[1:00:35] to you that fear my name shall the son
[1:00:38] of righteousness that same son that
[1:00:41] stood
[1:00:43] over uh uh
[1:00:45] aelon for Joshua to win his battle that
[1:00:49] same son is going to rise
[1:00:52] again praise the Lord amen amen he's
[1:00:56] going to rise this time with healing God
[1:01:00] in his
[1:01:01] wings praise the Lord are we
[1:01:05] together to them that fear my name shall
[1:01:08] the son of righteousness arise with
[1:01:10] healing in his
[1:01:12] wings and ye shall go forth the ones
[1:01:15] that have H experienced the raid of this
[1:01:20] Sunshine the ones that have experienced
[1:01:23] this healing in the wains from the son
[1:01:25] of righteousness you will go
[1:01:28] forth praise the Lord amen you will go
[1:01:33] forth and grow up as a stall in the as a
[1:01:39] calf in the stall sorry and ye shall
[1:01:42] treay down now there are there are four
[1:01:45] things I want you to watch here I think
[1:01:47] that's what that is on my mind I'm I'm
[1:01:49] getting excited so uh when I start
[1:01:51] stumbling then I'm getting excited amen
[1:01:57] my words are jumping over one another in
[1:01:59] my
[1:02:01] mouth now so so Malachi is saying here
[1:02:06] to you that fear my name the son of
[1:02:08] righteousness will arise with healing in
[1:02:11] his
[1:02:12] wings and you will go
[1:02:15] forth not only that but you will also
[1:02:19] grow
[1:02:21] up as a cal in the star now only that
[1:02:25] but you will tread
[1:02:27] down I want for us to look at the four
[1:02:30] of them you will tread down the wicked
[1:02:33] for they shall be arches under the sword
[1:02:36] of your feet in the days that I shall do
[1:02:40] this said the Lord of hosts now the
[1:02:44] reason why I'm taking the scripture is
[1:02:47] is the promise of healing because uh uh
[1:02:50] John have said that uh uh uh uh uh above
[1:02:55] all
[1:02:57] things you wish that we prosper in
[1:03:01] health even as our soul
[1:03:04] prospereth amen so we are talking on our
[1:03:08] last beginning series walking in health
[1:03:11] as it was in the beginning like we saw
[1:03:14] on Wednesday night Adam walked in health
[1:03:18] when God created him he was a healthy
[1:03:21] man praise the Lord he was was healthy
[1:03:24] in his body he was healthy in his mind
[1:03:27] so much healthy that he didn't even knew
[1:03:30] he was naked his mind was not corrupted
[1:03:32] it was not
[1:03:34] polluted his Spirit was
[1:03:37] healthy he was so much healthy that he
[1:03:40] could speak the the right thing he could
[1:03:42] say I call you lion and God say I'm
[1:03:44] pleased with
[1:03:46] that how much health can you compare to
[1:03:49] that you know when we were singing a
[1:03:51] song uh uh peace of God cover me
[1:03:55] I was thinking about that that's what
[1:03:57] the song came to my mind as we are
[1:04:00] talking on on this subject now uh uh uh
[1:04:04] and and and what I was thinking about is
[1:04:06] the scripture talks about the peace that
[1:04:10] passes
[1:04:11] all
[1:04:14] understanding what is
[1:04:16] that what is it the peace that passes
[1:04:22] all understanding what is it have you
[1:04:26] ever thought about it what what is this
[1:04:28] pieace that passes all understanding
[1:04:32] it's above your understanding you can't
[1:04:34] understand it but it's real it's there
[1:04:37] don't don't try to explain it to me the
[1:04:40] scripture say it pass your
[1:04:44] understanding the peace that passes
[1:04:47] all
[1:04:52] understanding praise the Lord
[1:04:54] if it pass my understanding I won't
[1:04:57] understand
[1:04:58] it but it's
[1:05:00] there it's
[1:05:02] real praise the Lord amen the peace that
[1:05:06] passes all understanding all
[1:05:11] understanding it's a promise of
[1:05:14] experiencing
[1:05:16] peace when even you don't understand it
[1:05:19] when it don't even make
[1:05:23] sense are we
[1:05:29] together I was thinking about that last
[1:05:32] night what I was studying and and and
[1:05:34] just like I said to you I said to myself
[1:05:37] I said my friend the scripture say it
[1:05:39] pass all understanding don't don't lose
[1:05:40] sleep over
[1:05:42] this praise the Lord it pass all
[1:05:45] understanding don't lose sleep over
[1:05:49] this but it's
[1:05:51] real praise the Lord is real that God
[1:05:56] can give you
[1:05:59] peace you can have
[1:06:02] peace even in the midst of
[1:06:06] trouble that God can give you peace you
[1:06:10] can be able to have peace when it don't
[1:06:14] even make sense why you lost your loved
[1:06:18] one yes you can understand year but you
[1:06:23] can have peace here
[1:06:26] yes
[1:06:29] yeah praise the Lord you see peace is
[1:06:32] not something that you can
[1:06:35] understand peace is something that you
[1:06:40] experience praise the Lord like someone
[1:06:43] said you cannot preach
[1:06:46] love you can't preach love and explain
[1:06:49] love you know to love one another no no
[1:06:51] no love is something that that you must
[1:06:54] live that's
[1:06:57] right praise the Lord that you must
[1:07:00] live for God so loved the word to
[1:07:04] express his love he did not bring us
[1:07:07] anopia to explain it for him to show her
[1:07:12] what love is he took on
[1:07:15] flesh he took a body and he came down to
[1:07:20] show us what love
[1:07:22] is that I can make you and I can die for
[1:07:31] you praise the
[1:07:33] Lord the peace that passes all
[1:07:38] understanding so as we continue in
[1:07:42] our uh if our technician will put our
[1:07:45] slides up as we continue in our uh
[1:07:50] uh beginning series we want to talk on
[1:07:53] the Sun of righteousness walking in in

[1:08:05] your soul Prosper it so it is the last
[1:08:08] part of that beginning series we want to

[1:08:14] healing the Bible say Enoch walk walked
[1:08:17] with God and he was
[1:08:19] not praise the Lord amen a man that walk
[1:08:23] with God is a healthy
[1:08:27] man for a man to be walking with God
[1:08:30] until his feet will be light and he will
[1:08:34] defy
[1:08:35] gravity and he will be
[1:08:38] Rapture praise the Lord

[1:12:40] Spirit can help us to be able to see it
[1:12:43] this morning this is a
[1:12:46] promise of the
[1:12:48] restoration of
[1:12:51] Health for the millennium
[1:12:54] and for
[1:12:56] eternity praise the
[1:12:59] Lord this is a promise as as we look in
[1:13:03] the subject you will realize why
[1:13:08] why uh uh uh Divine Healing
[1:13:13] Ministry it took a set
[1:13:16] pick praise the Lord
[1:13:20] amen and and and and and if you see
[1:13:22] around the the
[1:13:24] chrisom uh uh uh most of our our uh our
[1:13:29] our our mega church if if they are not
[1:13:32] allowing the people to live anyhow dress
[1:13:34] any how you know believe anything they
[1:13:37] are majoring on
[1:13:41] healing praise the Lord why because
[1:13:45] whenever God moves the devil also
[1:13:48] move it's with every
[1:13:52] Revival
[1:13:54] whenever he sees the move of God he
[1:13:56] makes a
[1:13:59] counterfeit praise the
[1:14:01] Lord I remember many years back uh uh uh
[1:14:05] over in the aost I had a good friend uh
[1:14:08] uh there Pastor
[1:14:10] innocent one time he invited me to
[1:14:13] preach on his Crusade and uh you know I
[1:14:16] spoke for him and and uh uh we we had a
[1:14:19] good time and then after couple of
[1:14:22] months he came to see me you know uh uh
[1:14:25] or he sent for me I went to see him and
[1:14:28] he's you know he says wow that was you
[1:14:30] know good you know we talk a little bit
[1:14:32] he asked me you know uh uh you know to
[1:14:35] have a little idea of uh you know what I
[1:14:37] believe where I was in the scripture so
[1:14:39] I try to share a little bit with him so
[1:14:42] he told me he says uh you know both of
[1:14:45] us we can work
[1:14:47] together I see that you have a salvation
[1:14:50] Ministry I have a Healing Ministry
[1:14:55] praise the Lord in my mind I'm thinking
[1:14:58] I'm I'm saying see that's a dual
[1:15:00] atonement but you can break
[1:15:03] it you can only preach salvation without
[1:15:08] healing you can preach healing without
[1:15:12] salvation you can't take one and leave
[1:15:14] the other but you see we are living in a
[1:15:17] day where you find uh H H all sorts of
[1:15:21] healing people o
[1:15:23] around why why is it that we are living
[1:15:27] also in a time where Medical Science has
[1:15:31] improve in history like never in the
[1:15:34] world why because the son of
[1:15:36] righteousness
[1:15:39] Rose the son of righteousness Rose and
[1:15:43] and and all they are doing is that they
[1:15:45] are just benefiting from the ren

[1:16:52] we and and and and and and and and in
[1:16:54] the name of that the church have created
[1:16:59] a lot of
[1:17:01] atrocities these people with Healing
[1:17:04] Ministry go off the word whatever they
[1:17:06] are using I don't care whatever they are
[1:17:09] using what I care about is that they are
[1:17:11] using the name of the Lord in
[1:17:13] vain praise the Lord amen because if you
[1:17:17] will be professing to heal people and
[1:17:20] then yet you be abusing them
[1:17:30] amen are we
[1:17:33] together but but but why what I'm trying
[1:17:37] to bring to you what I want you to see
[1:17:39] is there it is
[1:17:42] happening because a promise has been
[1:17:47] raising a promise of the son of
[1:17:51] righteousness that will rise with
[1:17:53] healing in his wings has been
[1:17:58] fulfilled this son has raisen over
[1:18:03] Us Praise the Lord we wouldn't have
[1:18:07] advanced in medical science if we did
[1:18:10] not have this
[1:18:13] promise praise the
[1:18:15] Lord amen I mean Medical Science has has
[1:18:19] has I mean has has has risen to such a
[1:18:22] place
[1:18:24] and all they are thinking and and and
[1:18:26] all they are believing is is uh their
[1:18:28] smartness has brought them to that place
[1:18:30] no it's not their
[1:18:31] smartness is because a blessing rose up
[1:18:34] in the
[1:18:36] earth and like the scripture says the
[1:18:39] the the the the how do the Bible says
[1:18:43] the sun rise on the just and the
[1:18:49] unel that's what the scripture says the
[1:18:51] sun rises on on the just and the
[1:18:55] unjust when God Rises a blessing as the
[1:18:59] sun rises the just benefit from it they
[1:19:02] unjust benefit from
[1:19:04] it until science have medical science
[1:19:06] have gone in into such a place with this
[1:19:09] AI
[1:19:10] technology that they are they they are
[1:19:12] they are building a bunch of artif
[1:19:15] future uh uh uh
[1:19:18] warm praise the Lord artificial warm and
[1:19:22] they can go over to uh uh over to a sper
[1:19:26] bank and produce hundreds of
[1:19:31] children that's the world we are living
[1:19:35] in Praise the Lord
[1:19:40] amen China will never lost
[1:19:44] population it's not funny it's
[1:19:49] real it's real they will never lost
[1:19:52] population why because long time they
[1:19:54] broke into that
[1:20:01] technology these are facts it's not it's
[1:20:04] not a mind makeup I'm not just picking
[1:20:06] something over my
[1:20:09] head that's what medical science
[1:20:16] is there's a big lawsuit now that is
[1:20:19] that is over around the us where the
[1:20:22] people that have donated to uh uh uh the
[1:20:25] the the I the Spring Bank uh you know uh
[1:20:30] uh uh has realized that uh you know what
[1:20:34] Their donation has given them over 50
[1:20:38] Children why because with all of these
[1:20:40] DNA uh I mean uh ancestr.com a child
[1:20:44] want to find out where they are coming
[1:20:46] from they realize that oh I have a
[1:20:48] sister living down the road oh there is
[1:20:50] another sister in California oh there is
[1:20:52] said not before they realize they are
[1:20:58] 50 it's not
[1:21:00] funny it's a
[1:21:04] reality it's a reality that you are
[1:21:06] living with it's happening in your time
[1:21:09] this is not a fiction
[1:21:13] story but I'm also trying to show you
[1:21:17] the reason why signs have been able to
[1:21:19] arrive to this place is because of this
[1:21:22] promise
[1:21:28] amen praise the lord it's because of
[1:21:32] this promise when when when Daniel said
[1:21:34] knowledge shall
[1:21:36] increase amen Daniel hon inspiration
[1:21:40] said knowledge shall increase Daniel
[1:21:42] never said they will make atomic bombs
[1:21:45] he only said knowledge shall increase
[1:21:47] amen he never said you will get Tesla a
[1:21:50] car that can drive by itself or you will
[1:21:53] get a not only a car now they even they
[1:21:55] are even making a semi
[1:21:57] truck Tesla have just puted out their
[1:22:00] semi truck that can drive across the
[1:22:02] entire country without a driver in
[1:22:05] it when Daniel said knowledge shall
[1:22:09] increase he never said that's what will
[1:22:12] happen but when knowledge increases what
[1:22:15] brother brandham said he says it explode
[1:22:17] like a
[1:22:18] rocket and it breaks up it breaks up and
[1:22:22] and all the industry of men benefit from
[1:22:25] it science benefit from it the
[1:22:28] technology World benefit from it the
[1:22:31] security World benefit from it the drug
[1:22:33] laws benefit from it the the the rubbers
[1:22:36] benefit from it the teeth benefit from
[1:22:43] it praise the Lord
[1:22:49] amen knowledge shall increase is the
[1:22:53] increase of knowledge that make people
[1:22:54] to sit down in India and be calling you
[1:22:57] on your phone to break into your bank
[1:23:05] account oh because it's your bank
[1:23:07] account now
[1:23:09] serious because it's your bank account
[1:23:11] now it's very
[1:23:14] serious the other one was funny but it
[1:23:16] one we got to we got to wash out now our
[1:23:18] bank account I don't want anybody
[1:23:20] breaking into my bank account
[1:23:24] but when Daniel said knowledge shall
[1:23:27] increase he never says inan scammers
[1:23:30] will be scamming
[1:23:36] you he never said it but scammers are
[1:23:40] tapping into
[1:23:42] that they can spend hundreds and
[1:23:45] thousands of hours on the on the
[1:23:49] net sleepless
[1:23:51] night
[1:23:54] just putting in different different
[1:23:56] Cults and just I mean they they are just
[1:23:58] hoping that you know it's it's it's
[1:24:00] almost just like somebody going to the
[1:24:02] gas station every morning and trying to
[1:24:04] buy Power
[1:24:06] Board hoping that it will be able to to
[1:24:09] make the
[1:24:10] millions praise the Lord that's the same
[1:24:13] way somebody just sitting down sitting
[1:24:15] down on their computer hoping that I
[1:24:17] will be able to break into some kind of
[1:24:19] a h h uh uh rich man
[1:24:23] account praise the Lord when they come
[1:24:26] to mind is overdrive this guy is p this
[1:24:29] guy is
[1:24:33] p praise the
[1:24:36] Lord you love the Lord amen don't don't
[1:24:40] make your account go over dry please
[1:24:42] that's not what I'm
[1:24:48] preaching but I'm trying to show you
[1:24:51] that a major promise has visited the
[1:24:55] Earth it was almost like when bam
[1:25:00] said he
[1:25:02] said the star of Jacob shall
[1:25:07] rise it was the very same star that the
[1:25:10] wise men
[1:25:12] saw praise the Lord that star came over
[1:25:16] Jerusalem and the religious people never
[1:25:19] see it
[1:25:21] right
[1:25:23] three men travel two
[1:25:25] years following a
[1:25:28] star that was written right in the Torah
[1:25:33] and people are in the Singas every
[1:25:35] Sunday reading from the Torah reading
[1:25:38] from their Bible and they did not know
[1:25:41] that a promise has been fulfilled in
[1:25:43] their
[1:25:50] day and those men God there where is he
[1:25:53] born King of the Jews they say the only
[1:25:56] King we have is
[1:25:58] Herold praise the
[1:26:00] Lord they took they took the wise men to
[1:26:03] Hera Palace he's he's our
[1:26:06] King he's the king of the Jews that we
[1:26:09] know says no no no no this one we saw
[1:26:12] his star in the
[1:26:15] east so Herod now have to send for the
[1:26:18] sedran council send for members sit down
[1:26:21] here look this God is talking something
[1:26:23] that he saw a St that you people that
[1:26:24] you're the church people that you're the
[1:26:27] church people y got to come up with what
[1:26:29] is happening
[1:26:30] here these babyon are coming and saying
[1:26:33] they are seeing Stu y y got to tell us
[1:26:35] what is happening then they check in the
[1:26:37] in the in in the in the scripture and
[1:26:39] realize that that the prophet Micah have
[1:26:42] said it in Beth
[1:26:45] hand but it Trace that promise back to
[1:26:47] what bam
[1:26:49] said Malachi is saying the son of
[1:26:52] righteousness will rise with healing in
[1:26:56] his
[1:26:57] wings healing in his wings so we realize
[1:27:01] that you know the beautiful thing about
[1:27:03] this when you think about it you think
[1:27:06] about it God is identifying
[1:27:11] himself as the
[1:27:14] son the natural son is giving for
[1:27:20] healing praise the Lord what you think
[1:27:22] people go to uh they go to Florida to go
[1:27:26] in Beach T what they going to do
[1:27:31] there when you when you when when you
[1:27:34] when you when you don't have a a lot of
[1:27:36] SunRay hitting you you lose V and
[1:27:41] day so God put healing in the sun even
[1:27:45] the natural
[1:27:48] son why because he himself is the son of
[1:27:55] righteousness and when he rises I'm
[1:27:57] feeling so excited right now amen I
[1:28:00] don't care for what you think about it
[1:28:02] but I'm feeling so excited why the
[1:28:04] reason why I'm feeling so excited is
[1:28:06] because this is becoming more real to me
[1:28:09] it's becoming more real than I ever saw
[1:28:13] it praise the
[1:28:21] Lord
[1:28:22] the son of righteousness will rise with
[1:28:24] healing in his wings now so this is this
[1:28:29] is our our series we've been we've been
[1:28:31] we've been talking about since the
[1:28:32] beginning of the word we went through
[1:28:34] first John sorry we went through first
[1:28:37] John and uh uh second
[1:28:40] John it gave us the opportunity to write
[1:28:43] uh the the I mean to to go through the
[1:28:46] three books uh that John wrote beside
[1:28:49] the Gospel of John and he he wrote that
[1:28:53] after his experience on the island of
[1:28:55] pmos Praise the
[1:28:59] Lord so on the island of pmos there were
[1:29:02] things that John saw you know he saw the
[1:29:06] the seven golden candlesticks he saw the
[1:29:08] Throne of God he saw the Lamb of God the
[1:29:11] opening of the seals he saw all of those
[1:29:13] things and then when he came back to the
[1:29:15] church you know he kept he kept
[1:29:17] referring to the beginning to the
[1:29:18] beginning to the beginning so now we on
[1:29:20] the last one year
[1:29:22] which is written there in 2 John 1: 6
[1:29:27] this is the
[1:29:28] Commandment that's what he said in 2
[1:29:31] John chapter 6 this is the
[1:29:33] commandment and uh uh don't don't don't
[1:29:38] go there the uh technicians just just
[1:29:41] stay where we are let me let me just go
[1:29:44] there uh just for the quick quick
[1:29:46] reference I just wanted
[1:29:47] to uh make a comment
[1:29:50] here
[1:29:53] are we together you love the Lord amen
[1:29:57] he's he's a good god he's a good god
[1:30:00] he's a faithful God now so John said
[1:30:04] here in verse
[1:30:06] 6 he said in uh uh second
[1:30:11] John you having only one uh uh I'm over
[1:30:15] in first John brother one got be in
[1:30:18] second okay verse six and this is
[1:30:22] love this is love that we walk after his
[1:30:26] commandment this is his Commandment that
[1:30:29] as ye have heard from the
[1:30:31] beginning yes should walk in it so when
[1:30:34] when I was when I was reading this and
[1:30:36] studying this I wanted to bring this
[1:30:38] through the entire book so I was I was I
[1:30:41] was I was saying okay what did they walk
[1:30:43] in you know then the thought hit me when
[1:30:46] I was reading T John walking in healing
[1:30:49] so that's where I taken the inspiration
[1:30:51] from walking in healing as it was in the
[1:30:53] beginning so that is our six our seven
[1:30:58] uh beginning praise the Lord that which
[1:31:01] was from the beginning the word of life
[1:31:03] that was the first one we talk about and
[1:31:05] that which was from the beginning was
[1:31:07] the logos God
[1:31:09] himself praise the Lord so we see when
[1:31:12] John got a revelation of what was taking
[1:31:16] place on the island of pmos he took
[1:31:19] everything back to the beginning because
[1:31:22] the beginning is the C
[1:31:24] chapter
[1:31:26] amen the the the old commandment is the
[1:31:29] word that's why he said the Commandment
[1:31:32] the old commandment is the word which ye
[1:31:34] have heard from the beginning the third
[1:31:37] one I write unto you fathers why because
[1:31:41] fathers our father is our
[1:31:43] beginning praise the Lord that's where
[1:31:46] we all begin from naturally humanly we
[1:31:49] all have fathers that's our beginning
[1:31:51] Jesus said when you pray say our father
[1:31:54] that's your beginning you got to
[1:31:56] identify yourself with your beginning
[1:31:59] amen if you know your beginning you will
[1:32:01] know your
[1:32:03] end praise the Lord if you have a true
[1:32:06] revelation of your beginning you don't
[1:32:08] have to worry about the
[1:32:12] end are we together and uh uh uh Let
[1:32:16] There therefore abide in you which ye
[1:32:19] have heard from the beginning so there
[1:32:21] again let the word abide in you and uh
[1:32:24] the devil sin it from the beginning we
[1:32:26] look at that we went into the the the
[1:32:29] serpent seed we talk about that old
[1:32:31] sepin uh that's how John call him if
[1:32:33] there is an old seent then there is a
[1:32:36] new one praise the Lord so the new sepin
[1:32:40] the one that you know now is not the old
[1:32:42] sepin so uh uh uh the six ones here now
[1:32:47] I I Bes you we talk about the elected
[1:32:49] lady from the beginning that was the
[1:32:51] last one that we spoke on praise the
[1:32:53] Lord a brother called me from India I
[1:32:57] think he follow our our service on this
[1:32:59] series and and uh and and he appreciated
[1:33:03] we thank the Lord for that and uh this
[1:33:06] is this is the Commandment which we have
[1:33:07] heard from the beginning that yes should
[1:33:09] walk in it so we are talking about
[1:33:11] walking in health walking in
[1:33:14] healing as it was in the beginning
[1:33:17] praise the Lord now so we know that uh
[1:33:21] th was that was one of the thing that
[1:33:24] was one of the thing yeah I mean uh uh
[1:33:27] uh it should it should be easy to to uh
[1:33:31] to be to understand but uh we would just
[1:33:34] we just trust the Lord if uh you know
[1:33:36] because God gave his word by Revelation
[1:33:38] but just like we said you know Adam came
[1:33:41] right from the hands of God he was a Son
[1:33:43] of God Eve came out of Adam she was a
[1:33:46] daughter of God they came out of God
[1:33:48] praise the Lord amen now how how how
[1:33:52] then uh uh did their blood became
[1:33:57] corrupted praise the
[1:33:59] Lord so we know that uh the the fall the
[1:34:03] int the the introduction of sin into the
[1:34:07] human race was the contamination of the
[1:34:12] blood if they if both of them came
[1:34:14] directly from the hand of God they
[1:34:16] should have pure blood how did their
[1:34:18] blood go
[1:34:20] corrupted
[1:34:23] Genesis chapter 3 hold that mystery now
[1:34:26] so uh uh uh uh but I said that to say
[1:34:31] because they came from the hand of God
[1:34:33] they were children of God they never
[1:34:35] knew anything that that that was
[1:34:38] sickness they were walking in perfect
[1:34:42] health praise the Lord they were walking
[1:34:45] in perfect
[1:34:47] health in so much that they never had no
[1:34:50] fear
[1:34:53] praise the Lord Adam was not worried
[1:34:55] about doing anything
[1:34:58] wrong because all he knew was
[1:35:01] right praise the Lord amen all he knew
[1:35:05] was
[1:35:07] right now we worried about doing wrong
[1:35:11] than worrying about doing
[1:35:13] right we worried that fear oh I don't
[1:35:16] want to do wrong oh I don't want to do I
[1:35:18] don't want to displease God we worried
[1:35:20] about it why because we fell from that
[1:35:23] place Adam never thought about it it was
[1:35:26] never a question in his
[1:35:29] mind praise the Lord it was not a
[1:35:32] question in his
[1:35:33] mind can you
[1:35:35] imagine can you imagine what happened
[1:35:39] that day because Adam was not there when
[1:35:42] the serpent spoke to Eve but can you
[1:35:46] imagine for the first
[1:35:48] time that he saw the animals in the
[1:35:52] Garden of Eden running out of
[1:35:57] order can you imagine that there was a
[1:36:02] windstorm and he never knew about it I
[1:36:06] never knew that there was going to be a
[1:36:07] storm today where is it coming from
[1:36:10] praise the
[1:36:11] Lord why because a daughter of God has
[1:36:14] failed sin was already
[1:36:17] introduced and and and and disorder
[1:36:20] started coming praise the
[1:36:23] Lord and you imagine the first time that
[1:36:26] Adam would would experience fear that he
[1:36:30] will hide himself from
[1:36:33] God can you imagine in your mind what
[1:36:36] that
[1:36:37] was that he would hide himself to hear
[1:36:41] the voice of God the Bible says the
[1:36:44] voice of God was walking in the garden
[1:36:46] calling Adam Adam where are you and for
[1:36:50] the first time
[1:36:52] for the first time
[1:36:54] Adam will hide
[1:37:01] himself are we
[1:37:17] together but before then the walk in
[1:37:20] health
[1:37:24] they were in such a healthy
[1:37:30] State and for many years and for many
[1:37:33] days never knew anything about
[1:37:37] headache or back pain or stomach
[1:37:42] upset praise the
[1:37:44] Lord that was not a that was not a a
[1:37:48] concern to
[1:37:49] him it didn't bother him it didn't
[1:37:51] trouble
[1:38:00] him and then
[1:38:02] suddenly something has
[1:38:05] happened something has happened for the
[1:38:08] first time that Adam will see
[1:38:14] blood for the first time he will see
[1:38:18] blood and say Eve was what
[1:38:24] happened what happened what went
[1:38:29] wrong she will say the sein has begil
[1:38:41] me the first time that she will
[1:38:43] experience
[1:38:49] pain the first time time that Adam will
[1:38:52] look at his wife and his heart will be
[1:39:01] broken sin this other
[1:39:04] sickness has entered
[1:39:10] in Praise the
[1:39:18] Lord that will be the first night that
[1:39:21] Adam will go to bed and he will wake up
[1:39:24] in the morning and he will start to feel
[1:39:27] his
[1:39:29] body praise the Lord he will start to
[1:39:32] feel his body take take that scene and
[1:39:34] and and and picture it this way picture
[1:39:36] it like

[1:40:09] back and he got to put his foot off the
[1:40:11] bed put his other foot down sit
[1:40:15] down he knew that it was
[1:40:19] different he knew knew that it was
[1:40:24] different and when Adam woke up that
[1:40:26] morning he knew that it was
[1:40:33] different he knew like if you know
[1:40:36] yourself you wake up in the morning and
[1:40:39] you are not okay you know that it's

[1:41:14] but that night the son was up before
[1:41:19] Adam praise the Lord

[1:41:25] morning when Adam woke up the sun was up

[1:46:04] little the a baby of of a cow amen a
[1:46:09] little animal there so you will grow

[1:46:31] welled that you can grow up to
[1:46:36] maturity
[1:46:39] amen not not not just becoming a church
[1:46:42] member but becoming a Son of God you
[1:46:45] know where you are standing with the
[1:46:46] word of
[1:46:49] God you will grow up now what why I love
[1:46:53] this is this the
[1:46:57] cfum you know the beautiful thing about
[1:46:59] this is that when you go back to
[1:47:03] Genesis you go back to
[1:47:07] Genesis even before
[1:47:10] Moses even before Moses it was
[1:47:14] Moses honor
[1:47:16] Moses where the scripture really put
[1:47:19] what was a clean animal and what was an
[1:47:22] unclean
[1:47:24] animal is that right but you realize
[1:47:27] that even before that
[1:47:31] time in in uh in uh in uh in the
[1:47:36] ACT God told
[1:47:38] Noah that he should take the clean
[1:47:42] animals
[1:47:44] seventh their unclean animals must come
[1:47:47] into the arc two by two it was not every
[1:47:50] animal that came in
[1:47:53] PS God was preserving the clean
[1:47:59] animals and let me tell you another
[1:48:01] thing again go back and and and and look
[1:48:04] at over there in exodor or num levitic
[1:48:07] Leviticus most especially when you talk
[1:48:09] about the clean animals the clean
[1:48:11] animals are
[1:48:13] identified by what chewing their
[1:48:19] cup
[1:48:20] chewing their cut the clean animal is
[1:48:23] identified by
[1:48:27] that praise the Lord and it and it's
[1:48:31] applied to us
[1:48:34] spiritually
[1:48:37] amen it's a it's a sense of
[1:48:40] sanctification if you can chew on the
[1:48:49] word
[1:48:52] amen a clean animal is identified by
[1:48:55] that because they chew on their car they
[1:48:58] they eat and they keep it
[1:49:00] there go go and look at
[1:49:03] Leviticus all the animals that are set
[1:49:05] aside to be clean
[1:49:07] animals most of them have their
[1:49:11] attributes they can chew on their
[1:49:14] cut and God designed that
[1:49:18] way because we are sheep of his pastures
[1:49:23] that's what the psalm said this morning
[1:49:25] amen the psalm brother brother Ben read
[1:49:28] that's what it it said we are sheep of
[1:49:30] his
[1:49:33] pasture and one good nature of sheep is
[1:49:36] that they chew on their
[1:49:39] cup they keep it
[1:49:41] there you know the Bible don't become
[1:49:45] Dusty they take the word they don't only
[1:49:48] rely on my pastor say no they take the
[1:49:50] word and they go back and study the word
[1:49:53] they they go back and chew that word
[1:49:55] again and bring it up and chew it again
[1:49:57] let me look at it again let me look at
[1:49:59] it
[1:50:01] again why because in that is
[1:50:05] safety when you do that there is safety
[1:50:08] in
[1:50:09] that amen when you do that you will be
[1:50:13] fair
[1:50:15] well
[1:50:17] amen bring it up chew it again put it
[1:50:20] back bring it
[1:50:22] up you will be farewell and then you
[1:50:24] will grow to
[1:50:27] maturity so Under This Promise of the
[1:50:30] son of righteousness Rising I'm just
[1:50:33] feeling so excited this morning amen it
[1:50:36] it is it is a light when you see a
[1:50:38] promise for your day is
[1:50:41] light the Bible says those that walk in
[1:50:44] darkness great light has shine on
[1:50:48] them and that light was was a spiritual
[1:50:56] light I spoke on this before but never
[1:50:59] not not like this way not like this way
[1:51:02] and the fourth one there is that they
[1:51:05] will tread down on the wicked overcoming
[1:51:10] power when the son of righteousness
[1:51:13] Rises when the raid of the sun has
[1:51:16] shined upon you it will Quicken your
[1:51:18] mortal body
[1:51:20] it will give you overcoming power you
[1:51:23] will overcome yourself you will overcome
[1:51:26] sin you will overcome the devil it will
[1:51:30] give you overcoming
[1:51:40] power right there in Malachi
[1:51:43] 4 rise up with healing in his wing they
[1:51:46] will go forth they will grow up as a c
[1:51:49] in the star they will tread down the
[1:51:51] wicked that's the four blessings there
[1:51:54] in Malachi 4 let's take
[1:51:57] this now over in uh uh Isaiah 53 the
[1:52:02] Jews called Isaiah 53 the holiest of
[1:52:08] holy and and I I I say I say the Jews in
[1:52:12] a sense to say scall let me say scallet
[1:52:15] because the
[1:52:17] Jews really they do not try to conform
[1:52:21] themselves to Isaiah 53 because there is
[1:52:23] no way they can believe it and don't
[1:52:26] believe in
[1:52:29] Jesus when they read Isaiah 53 they try
[1:52:33] to put it in the
[1:52:35] future they know that it was speaking
[1:52:37] about their
[1:52:40] Messiah are we together amen so in
[1:52:44] Isaiah 53 when you look at verse 5 but
[1:52:48] he was wounded for our
[1:52:51] transgression now you will see in verse
[1:52:53] five here just like we saw in Malachi
[1:52:56] there is four things also that is
[1:52:57] providing the number four is what
[1:53:00] Deliverance
[1:53:02] okay so he was wounded for our
[1:53:06] transgression he was bruised to take
[1:53:09] care of
[1:53:10] iniquity he was chesting to take care of
[1:53:14] peace and the stri on his back was to
[1:53:18] take care of healing
[1:53:23] are we together
[1:53:27] amen but he was wounded for our
[1:53:30] transgression he was bruised for our
[1:53:32] iniquity the Chas of our peace was upon
[1:53:36] him and with his stries we are healed
[1:53:39] now so this promise you will realize
[1:53:42] that many times is is is qued just for
[1:53:47] physical
[1:53:48] healing but inia is more than physical
[1:53:53] healing
[1:53:55] amen inia is the atonement that tie us
[1:54:00] to Divine Healing the healing of our
[1:54:03] soul and our body and our
[1:54:07] mind like we talk about the peace that
[1:54:10] passes all understanding the Bible said
[1:54:13] he was chastised so we can have
[1:54:17] peace even though our all they suffer
[1:54:20] but in our soul there's peace of
[1:54:24] mind we are settled down and know that
[1:54:27] God is in
[1:54:28] control what what what you think make
[1:54:31] those Hebrew boys to say is that uh uh
[1:54:34] even if our God don't deliver us we will
[1:54:36] not bow down what make them what brought
[1:54:39] them to that
[1:54:45] place so this this is not just only it's
[1:54:49] not just only for physical
[1:54:52] healing because no matter how many times
[1:54:55] you get healed in this body you will
[1:54:57] still get
[1:54:59] sick praise the
[1:55:02] Lord you will still get sick because the
[1:55:05] body is a filling body the body is not
[1:55:11] redeemed it's a body of
[1:55:14] corruption praise the Lord so you cannot
[1:55:17] limit This Promise only for your
[1:55:20] physical healing
[1:55:22] no it's more than your physical
[1:55:28] healing are we together it's more than

[2:16:31] Brandon the
[2:16:35] Lord that's why history is important go
[2:16:39] back and read church
[2:16:42] history I was thinking about doing doing
[2:16:44] something I'm I'm still working on it
[2:16:46] there are many of these Church churches
[2:16:48] Baptist Methodist
[2:16:50] Presbyterian some of the people that are
[2:16:52] in it they don't even know who is the
[2:16:54] founder they don't even know how those
[2:16:56] moves
[2:16:58] started you are in something you don't
[2:17:00] even know you don't even know the
[2:17:01] history of it how can you sustain
[2:17:16] it
[2:17:21] healing campaigns healing in his
[2:17:25] wings praise the Lord go back and read
[2:17:28] history they will tell you he's the

[2:17:41] God the promise the promise is place the
[2:17:44] people in the
[2:17:46] word tell me as says I I I I can never
[2:17:49] do this brother I can I cannot descend
[2:17:51] people he says the gift is not for you
[2:17:53] but put the people in the word if you
[2:17:55] can if you can bring the promise before
[2:17:57] the people that God has purchased your
[2:18:00] healing if you can make it real to them
[2:18:03] they will step in their healing and you
[2:18:06] can do it you can do the same yes

[2:18:13] take the word the word has been given to
[2:18:14] you make the word real
[2:18:19] put the person name
[2:18:24] there you try to impersonate the son of
[2:18:27] man Ministry you'll be blasphemy you go
[2:18:29] to hell for it CU you will never repeat
[2:18:31] that it will never be
[2:18:35] repeated all of these people that are
[2:18:41] impersonating someone showed me the C of
[2:18:44] a Blasphemous photo uh recently I think
[2:18:47] very when he was here the brother took
[2:18:49] brother Brandon from there and put a
[2:18:50] pillow of fire over his
[2:18:53] head all looking for some kind of for
[2:18:57] recognition then we say it's the message
[2:18:59] of the
[2:19:04] hour when the word is f with
[2:19:10] realities but I just wanted to catch
[2:19:12] your mind on
[2:19:13] this I saw this many years uh
[2:19:18] son of Rous would ride with healing
[2:19:20] campaigns healing in his wings now let's
[2:19:22] let's let's take this now these two
[2:19:24] messages were preach in the same day so
[2:19:27] just follow the trench of thought here
[2:19:29] now to them that fear his name shall the
[2:19:32] son of RA righteousness rise with
[2:19:34] healing in his
[2:19:36] wings let the son of righteousness the
[2:19:40] word of
[2:19:42] God let the son of righteousness their
[2:19:46] Living Word the word that you are
[2:19:48] believing the word that been preached to
[2:19:53] you don't look to history The Living
[2:19:55] Word is here the word is
[2:20:02] real let the son of righteousness the
[2:20:05] word of God rise in the heart of the
[2:20:08] people and the healing rate of
[2:20:14] faith in that word kills every
[2:20:19] disobedient not the sensation you
[2:20:23] feel it's the virtue that comes from out
[2:20:25] of the word that's the reason why I say
[2:20:27] is that we play church until we don't
[2:20:31] take the word of God
[2:20:33] serious we don't take it
[2:20:36] serious we are just happy to just be a
[2:20:39] church member but this is a Living
[2:20:44] Word you cannot go under the sun without
[2:20:47] feeling its
[2:20:51] effect if you get under the son you will
[2:20:54] feel its
[2:20:58] effect how can you sit under the son of
[2:21:00] righteousness the reveal word of the
[2:21:03] hour and there is no effect of the word
[2:21:05] in your
[2:21:09] life I believe brother Bram I believe
[2:21:12] pill of fire I believe I believe
[2:21:16] believe he was sent for sons of God to
[2:21:19] be manifested sir he was sent for you to
[2:21:21] get off your but and stand on your feet
[2:21:24] and be a Son of

[2:29:51] like John said Rejoice my heart to see
[2:29:54] my children walking in
[2:29:56] truth and many of us we we had our
[2:29:59] experience and you know we settled down

[2:30:13] have a younger
[2:30:15] generation if if if if if Jesus

[2:31:26] learned her wedding was the first
[2:31:28] wedding
[2:31:31] Year and that always blesses me whenever
[2:31:34] I see she and her husband here because I
[2:31:37] hold that as a
[2:31:40] token sometimes you people don't I mean
[2:31:43] can to tell you
[2:31:45] everything human mind don't run
[2:31:49] Church it runs by the spirit of God yes
[2:31:55] sir and sometimes it's just one thing
[2:31:58] you just hold
[2:32:01] up said God I hold this thing as said
[2:32:06] token we just don't just don't want to
[2:32:08] come to church there people com and and
[2:32:10] and you know look for the church that is
[2:32:12] full that everybody standing outside and
[2:32:14] people in their car whether they
[2:32:15] standing outside talking not even
[2:32:17] listening to just to have a crowd
[2:32:22] no when the healing rid of the word
[2:32:25] comes in the heart of the people they
[2:32:28] will not wait for the doors to be open
[2:32:30] sir they will come prayed up they will
[2:32:33] be lining their family up with the
[2:32:38] word that's what we talking
[2:32:41] about that's what a church
[2:32:45] is
[2:32:50] praise the
[2:32:52] Lord you see many of the Young The Young
[2:32:55] Ones you know well they see they see
[2:32:57] folks coming up for communion they want

[2:33:07] communion as soon they come they eat the
[2:33:09] bread drink the wine they already know

[2:33:21] parent that's why when a child comes to
[2:33:24] me I said go and talk to your
[2:33:27] parent because it's it's it's your
[2:33:29] responsibility as a
[2:33:31] parent to be able to know that your
[2:33:33] child is ready for
[2:33:35] that and then when that child comes and
[2:33:38] that child is baptized by the authority
[2:33:41] of the word I have in every
[2:33:43] right every right because that church
[2:33:46] that child has been baptized in the name
[2:33:49] of the Lord Jesus Christ into the body
