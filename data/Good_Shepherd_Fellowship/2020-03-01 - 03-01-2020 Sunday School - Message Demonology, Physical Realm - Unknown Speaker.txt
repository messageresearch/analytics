========================================

I have some lovely brother Bosworth Baxter Lindsay more always got 5m barons on others they're just very fine man but there's just something about when you get a group of man together one has one thing one has another sometimes that's conjuring or I think myself and so I feel like I'm just free now we can just have a big time mmm-hmm it's roll up our sleeves and you dive in and eat I think about rolling up your sleeves and having a a big time my first Bible was nature I learned God through nature and a hundred feet hmm I love the peach and you like to be Sonny Boy if you like the feasts and love your mother you're gonna make a good boy and even my conversion didn't take it all out of me so one day I was up in the mountains of fishing away I said for the benefit of this little boy and I was finishing up there in the mountains and for the other little kiddies of course sitting around and how efficient route and oh it's wonderful the springtime I go along there cutting over the straps just in the next hole you like acting just praising the Lord and having a big time shot sometimes drop my line down I believe in shopping well I know something gets ahold of me it just does something to me so I've been going quite a little bit that morning and when I come back the strangest things a lot of bear in the country up there New Hampshire I have little camp but there were a seashell I had a little old tent setting up little pup tent I've been living in and a black bear is the most mischievous thing there is so an old mother bearing and a couple little cubbies that got in there and had they made have out of my tent now what do you think I ought to go to that bear little girl back house that red hair back there I want to go to actually I really shouldn't but here's what she done she come in she tore my pants down and she scattered everything out and eat up all my food I had there and she is just doing fine so when I come up away she went and she squealed to her cub and Wonderlic up run off with her the other one run he just set there his back turned to me like this Mina's doing something now I didn't have enough in the hand but a little old hand acts have been shopping around some elders down there well sure no thought for is all I guess that telephone pole out there and she sat down she squealed on this a little bear he didn't pay attention to it he skipped it I thought what's that little fella doing I walked up a little kosher I'm afraid to get too close free she'd scratched me his look so good to see a tree and I know she could climb too so don't get too close to her called odd and all the nature of there so I went just a little bit closer and you know what happened I like pancakes I make you boys like pancakes oh boy old boys do I've seen them put their hand stuff we all like pancakes and I just love them and I like to pour honey on them being a bad dish you know that's what keeps us straightened out you know is the honey you know so and listen I don't sprinkle him a really bad time them I really pour it on works really good in the heavy I don't just Frank a little bit here and there I really poured on him get him all filled up with honey and then you know I had a bucket of honey up there that's a gallon bucket of honey and bears are very fond of honey so this little fella had got in there he got the lid off that bucket of honey and he was sitting there like this but this was a bucket of honey hungary's are my kids he comes up and you know how to eat it like you would know so he just saw his little paw down in and lick it like that and licking and he turned around to look to me and his little eyes was all matted together his little belly was just a sick as hiccup evil honey he was just setting a duck and he's handing out a look at honey like this is heart is aching legs oh my I thought about a good old time Holy Ghost meeting when we just kicked the bucket over sicker hand down a jar Nick away this key protocol just licking away and you'll want to throw funny thing was old actually I don't fell I got it as much as you could he left the bucket down and run off out there you know what happened the mother bearing the other little bear honey oh so well maybe our meeting will be something on the head order I hope so we can keep telling how there is in the glory of God falling upon us all right I'm glad see they look children out I like to tell you something like that and make it more action we have more time we can talk a little more and we'll talk to dad mother now about something we're go talk on demonology in Psalms 103 1 2 3 we read these verses most every minister clergyman or Bible reader knows and by heart bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquity who healeth all of their diseases I want you to notice there it was an all who forgiveth all thine iniquities who heals all of our diseases now can we bow our heads just a moment now Heavenly Father we thank thee this afternoon for being out here we thank thee for these little children it's sitting around there's the man of tomorrow and women if there is a tomorrow if Jesus Terri's and our Father we pray that that you'll bless us now as we're talking now on your word and about the great enemy we have Satan we pray God that you'll let us put a thrown out on mechanized unit here the power of God that'll wish spending tonight and every inch of his ground Lord and showing that he don't have no legal rights at all that Christ defeated him in our stead there at Calvary when he died and he spoiled principalities and robbed Satan have ever ever his power that he had and God give us wisdom and understanding now to know and to explain to the people how that they might know how to be healed and to defeat Satan in Jesus name we pray amen now for a few minutes we go to speak on demonology you hear so much about demons now tomorrow afternoon we're probably finish up I wanted two days of this week anyhow to preach on this just are two days for afternoon services to talk on this now the first thing what a demon is you hear so many people talking about a demon well now a demon devil all comes from one word and in the English is called tar matter a fellow that torments is a devil a evil one he say now the Bible today there's two most so many people is some old backed book that Graham Paul Graham all read or something like that there's not much to it it's for the old folks and so forth but that's wrong it's for everybody and demons are tormentors that torment us now there is demons that comes into the soul of man and that is in the phraseology that would be that would be in the I'd say this'll the demon that comes into the soul is something at torments the soul many times you can see a person maybe of insanity now they may be yet a converted person fill with the holy spirit and yet be totally insane see that's right that has nothing to do with the soul it's a tormentor something at torments them now all sickness we have to find first that all sickness came from the devil God is not the author of sickness no sickness comes from God God sometimes permits Satan to put sickness on you as a whip to bring you back to the house of God when you've disobeyed but sickness in its beginning come from the devil could you imagine a person would believe that God our Heavenly Father would be the author of such a thing as sickness and death well no he isn't never was never will be dog permits death because of disobedience God permits death as one writer said all the deaths can do God harness the to of buggy and it pulls us into the presence of God a believer but a the word death means separation jesus said he that heareth my word and believeth on him and sent me hath everlasting life and he said I am the resurrection life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and we packed the bodies of each other over the Saint lists of our graves but he shall never die now if you watch when he spoke of Lazarus he said Lazarus sleepeth the disciples man like we are they said all if he sleep as he do as well he meant taking a rest but they thought but he'd come and talk to them in their language he said he's dead what you believe but said I go wakey waking see when your death means separate now if one of you should one of your family died or something he is if it's converted they're not dead they're dead in the humanistic standpoint but they're just separated from us but they're in the presence of God they're not dead and they can't die it's impossible for him to die jesus said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into judgment but has passed from death to life so he can't die anything it's immortal eternal it came perish it's imperishable life he's got it because God has give it to him and not not meritorious it's what it's unconditional God gives it to him God calls no man could come to God except God called him jesus said no man can come to me except my father causing drowsing that right so it's God and all maybe tomorrow afternoon we'd get a little bit more on that cause I want to get this thing of disease to you so that you'll see that there was a time when we become Dermott eyes and our great-grandfather you know that doctor knows that would you do to you Bible readers you know the germ of life started in your great-grandpa to becoming a germ and come out to your grandfather then into your father and then to your mother and where you are now that's right scripture even teaches that here's the scripture for you if you want I believe it said that Levi paid tithes when he was in the loins of Abraham which was his great-grandfather that right so see the germ become back there but your souls were made up before the foundation of the world and God created man in his own image spirit of man not a man in his own image but man in his own image see and then he made them male and female before he ever had a man in the dust the earth which we had a chance to Sassoon and take a time and go back into that just see how God now it's between the line but when you see it comes right up with the line and seeing how that God back in the beginning what he did there and how he moved down into the earth and how that may he made man in His image and then God turned around was made in the image of man to redeem man now when God made man in His image he was a spirit man and there then there was no man to till the soil that he created man how the dusty earth a chronologist and so forth and these people are searched and get old bones and so forth and believe in evolution I've even a right kind of evolution man a volutes from himself but not all from one cell no sir the calls a a bird has been a bird ever since God made him a bird and a monkeys been a monkey a man's been a man that's right now I was talking to a doctor here while back and Louisville he said while revered grandma told about how the navies of Africa how they eat just go down below some of the office things you'd ever see how they would eat just pick up things it's contaminated maggots in it just shake him on a maggot no don't make any difference to him see they said drink anything don't make any difference what it is he said but Brevard brand then people are not human I said oh yes they are they sure are human I said the closest thing to a human being in the beasts line is the Japan Sea and you tried for 4000 years get one motor out of that Japan and he can't do it I said cause he can't think yes nothing to think with or you can learning little things like a horse gee and haw put on glasses or smoke a cigar ballon see step on a bicycle ride a horse or something like that but just like Jian Hall to a horse or to a dog or something like that I said he's an animal but you let me go back in Africa to the wildest ride they got and that's the little tribe of the Bushmen now it said probably his great great great great grandfather never saw a white man or nothing the only thing he knows he don't even know which is right in left hand the only thing he knows is eke and he eats white and get his hands off it's human flesh anything else they can difference to him just so he eat but let me get him at five years old and at 15 years old you'll speak good English and have a good education why he's got a soul God made him a human being and he's got just as much right to hear the gospel at least once as we have the preaching around here all over America so the people over and over and over begging persuading and everything letting hear it one time in washing screen and run to the altar real quick see yes sir that's what my heart is brother today when I think of African that poor little black hands raising up sin brother branham one more time about Jesus whole mercy there's something in me digs and burn just as quick as I get money enough up I get over there too that's what I do is every penny I get everything God knows besides just what I can eat and most people give me the clothes and just what I can barely live by myself just as close as I can I thought right into missionary funds which the government has ranged you don't even pay income tax on it to get up three or four or five thousand dollars and I take a cross over there and preach the gospel to the people that I know that that day I'll have to answer now know what I answer for I used to want to go in a city at a hold a big meeting back when he had lots of money and they have great campaigns and thousands of dollars I give it order to Red Cross and so forth that's no slam to them but coming down the street in a four thousand dollar car is a big diamond studs own smoking a cigar five hundred dollars a week on the money that's sick people no sir no indeedy only as soon as you get out of the city they said of holy rollers and everything like I had to make him and down in the religion that we're sending it for no sir I take it myself and before God as my judge I put it in the gospel work on her so I know it on that day and I have to give an account for my stewardship it's given correctly that's exactly right cause I realize as I treat the people I'm treating God just my attitude towards you is my attitude towards Christ your attitude towards me is the same thing that's right towards Christ now to see of people like that and see how that a human being man with an immortal soul now that can't die can't perish kajan guns that have everlasting life that God sovereignly in his own will gave it to you and now then now I for all any correct this just a little bit of say something somebody's gotta go and say brother brand there's a Calvinists no I'm not I'm a Calvinist as long as Calvinist is in the Bible but when Calvinist gets out of the Bible then I'm on Armenian see I believe in holding this now I believe in Calvinists too but both of them one run out on the limb and went this way one rail the lamb and went that way if it wasn't for the book of Ephesians to bring it back and put it the right place where God did we don't hold Bo mixed up but they both got adopting but to go to seat on it each one that's the holiness and the Calvinists to the Armenian now Calvinist has something true I believe that that the Calvinistic doctrine oddly this insecurity I believe the church has eternal security any reader the Bible knows that calls God's already said it with a period or without blemish that right then it's go to be there is that right the by the church is eternally secured now are you in the church as the next thing if you're in the church all right you're secured with the church but you better stay in the church and how do you get in the church by shaking hands no put your name in the book no sir by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body and that body God judged at Calvary was the body of Jesus Christ and we're baptized into that body by one spirit we have eternal security as long as we're in the body of Christ nothing can separate us nothing can touch us if you go out you go out by your own will but just too sure if you're in the body of Christ as sure as Jesus rose from the dead you'll rise to God's already done that you can't sin or you die my be a sinner in your sight but if I'm the Christ God don't see it because his sins atones his blood atones for my sins there see I can't see him he's born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin the seed of God remains anything see he's willing to if he's makes a mistake sure he's right then willing to confess it if he's a real Christian he will do it if he holds it back he shows he ain't got nothing in the first place right yeah he got nothing to begin with but if he's a real Christian right here you playing a grain of wheat in the ground it'll always be a grain of wheat chuckle burrs may be all around and everything else but it'll be a grain of wheat as long as it stands that right and if a man is really born to the Spirit of God he isn't in and out and back and forth your honor in the world out here no sir no no huh you're not a cocklebur one day and a grain of wheat the next day God don't have that in the field yes sir if you're born to the Spirit of God you're a Christian from that time until it till you go away and then you're you're immortal with God that's right if you're in the church now now let's talk about the death side now how could a person on that estate and that kind of a condition ever be sick because that your body is not yet redeemed your body is not redeemed no matter how much how good you are how saintly and how holy how much Holy Spirit that's only your soul and your soul is not completed yet it's just got the blessing the promise of God which is the earnest of our salvation but now if we have no earnest of our resurrection no divine healing then I'll have no assurance or nothing to prove to me that there is a resurrection just like oh Christ doesn't live in my heart if I have to take it from some kind of a psychological thing back gutter had to be somewhere like that well then I'd be a little skeptic oven and that's reason over in Africa when they come here come missionaries up bringing thousands of those natives and there's packing the little mud idols and everything else is because that they had just heard psychic side of the Bible that's right my own church is Baptist Methodist Presbyterian all went in there but when they seen the power of God come in demonstration that settled it they know that God was God but now what starts this sickness now the first thing it's a spirit before it becomes a disease just the same as you as a spirit before you become a human being now I'm going to take brother Woollett share as an example brother with it all right there was a time when you and I wasn't nothing and then the first thing God gave us a life and estate say if I take your body down this afternoon you're made up of a bunch of cells held together with atoms and now someday them atoms will be destroyed if Jesus Terri's you'll go on back they'll be just like they was in the beginning go back into the air but when your spirit returns will atom or gather together again with this spirit and bring forth another brother well that's just like that only younger when he was at his best when a man gets passed about 25 years old he finds a few wrinkles under his eyes and some gray hairs coming in let's go to be cause this after you and one of these days it's go to take you no matter who you are it's going to take you but it gradually you'll get in the corner here and God will get you out of that corner you're getting this corner here death alone was having over here but actually while it'll get you in but then what death can do it takes us full toll and then at when it's done all it can do when God gave you this life and used it's your best at about 23 when you come into the resurrection you'll come back just exactly like he was when you're 23 years old 25 for death city and death will have everything that it can do it's set in there but you'll come right back where you were now if each one of your your cells in your body let's take it down now you come sell at your cells tell that you're selling lay it apart you're on a platform that you're each cell in your body you'll come down to one little tiny germ where you begin can be seen as a natural I yet to look under scope glasses I've seen the term of life under a microscope it looks like a little bitty thread and the first thing starts is writing a spine it's like a little knot that's the first little cell cumulates on top of a cell now if I had to take that one sing a little cell as ever wanted he come from one little teeny cell germ what is the germ a germ is the little teeny the smallest of cell dwell what's that to that now Chuck you down from every piece of you down to this one little cell and I haven't found you yet I've just got yourselves lay down well then next thing blood cells and flesh cells and whatever they are laying them all out here but I haven't got you yet now I'm down to one germ now well I'm going to take that little cell apart now where you at your life and the life makes the first cell which is a germ then everything actor its nature dog after dog bird after bird manager man developing cells cell on cells cell on cell comes up to where you are human being developing of cells now that was our deigned of God to be so but not what about a cancer of self of him a little bit now God gave you your life and say here you are today Here I am there if there's nothing on my hand but there might be a cancer on my hand sometimes well how'd that cancer get there let's see what the cancer is nice take him apart let's go take him now he's a bunch of cells soon did you know that tumor cataract any of those things or cells they don't have no form some of them spreads out and some look like a spider and some looks run streets the red cancers it's like long red threads that runs through and then needs a rolls cancer which usually comes out of the breasts of a woman it's like pancakes laying on one another and any court Spradling out they just grow anywhere sometimes tumors are lopsided this way long low oblong and everything they have no farm because they're after a spirit which has no farm but it's a developing of cells it's about yourselves it's saying you're right now is a tumor or cancer this developing cells growing growing growing it's eating suckin your life from you living on the blood stream cataract takes the mucus of the eye girls run over covers yourself over shut your eyes off someone comes in never gets like chewbert ler that comes just a little small germs there's nothing to the size of it the same sized germ makes an elephant makes a a nothing is the size of the germ and some of them takes body forms some never does and some ever goes into cells some become spirit torments the soul we're trying to get that party I'll leave that part for tomorrow afternoon if I can or that soul spirit comes and how down already here now friends I'm not telling this from some kind of a psychologic I have dealt with demons for years and you know that if you only knew the thing after the services is over at night what goes on sometimes you don't all remember when you come against the spirit you better know what you're speaking about just don't stand there and carry on cause it angle to do any good but when actually a demon has to obey you you'll recognize it it ain't how loud you holler and then how much aura you put on its what's back here that he'll recognize the truth Jesus just said James come on remember the sign [Music] you [Music] you [Music]
