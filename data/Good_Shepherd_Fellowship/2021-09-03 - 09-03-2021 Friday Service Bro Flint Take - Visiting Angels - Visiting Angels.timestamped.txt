[50:35] you guys and for the wesley god bless
[50:37] you good to see you again
[50:38] brother steve
[50:40] uh
[50:41] you know the sister just singing that
[50:43] song through it all
[50:45] i mean we've been through some battles
[50:47] we've been through some hard times the
[50:49] older you get the longer you serve the
[50:50] lord
[50:51] you can look back and you know that
[50:54] you know god was with you
[50:57] and things weren't always so easy but
[50:59] now we have an understanding
[51:01] of why sometimes we have to go through
[51:03] those things is that right
[51:05] and
[51:06] you know it builds faith and if i didn't
[51:08] have a problem how would i know that he
[51:09] could solve them amen i i love that i
[51:12] love that uh i'm gonna set my watch over
[51:14] here i love that uh that verse there
[51:19] and uh you know we're just so grateful
[51:22] that god has called us
[51:24] and god has called us out of the chaos
[51:26] of this world
[51:28] and um it's because you know the world
[51:30] is getting pretty crazy
[51:33] and uh it's it's just um
[51:36] you know who knows but uh the thing of
[51:39] it is
[51:40] you know there even your pastor was
[51:41] mentioning tonight about geheza and
[51:44] elijah
[51:46] and he said that uh you know there was
[51:47] more of them
[51:49] amen with haze and elijah than there was
[51:52] against them
[51:53] and we know the story how
[51:55] elijah came out and the syrian army was
[51:57] coming down so all the circumstances
[51:59] everything
[52:01] you know it looked hopeless it looked
[52:02] like they were in a lot of trouble
[52:05] and gesa
[52:07] was standing there and and
[52:10] you know that's all he could see all he
[52:11] could see was
[52:13] the
[52:13] the army of syria
[52:16] and you know how would you be thinking
[52:17] how would you feel if that was you and
[52:20] all you could see is the army
[52:22] of syria
[52:24] and uh then
[52:25] geheza
[52:27] being a man of god and the man of faith
[52:28] and not just the man of god and a man of
[52:30] faith but a man whose eyes were open at
[52:32] that time
[52:33] and he's looking around and he's to him
[52:36] he's thinking do these boys really want
[52:38] to come against this army
[52:40] so he's looking at a different
[52:41] perspective
[52:43] he's seeing something different
[52:45] he's looking you know at the armies of
[52:47] heaven and all that are with them
[52:51] and he realizes that uh you know these
[52:54] guys are in trouble
[52:55] and then he says lord open the boy's
[52:57] eyes
[52:58] and then god does something very
[53:00] wonderful
[53:01] he opens the haze's eyes
[53:04] now from one instance
[53:05] all he could see was you know we're
[53:07] toast we're in trouble here
[53:10] and a second later his eyes are open and
[53:14] now you have to it's echoing or
[53:16] something but now you have to realize
[53:20] that it's just like sitting in this room
[53:22] right now
[53:25] we are seeing a room
[53:26] we're seeing brothers and sisters and we
[53:28] notice sister has so and so on tonight
[53:30] and brother has this and
[53:32] we've sung our songs and oh you
[53:34] musicians can be seated god bless you
[53:36] and um thank god for your musicians and
[53:39] the faithful men and women in this
[53:41] church for all these years so
[53:43] and uh you know we're sitting in this
[53:45] room tonight and all we can see right
[53:47] now mostly is just just the room
[53:50] but we know that according to the word
[53:52] of god and every word in the bible is
[53:54] true that we know that we're not the
[53:57] only ones here tonight
[53:59] if we believe the word and we always say
[54:01] yes i believe the word well we believe
[54:03] the word that means that
[54:04] if the word is true
[54:06] and where two or three are gathered
[54:07] there i would be in the midst and if god
[54:09] is there then there must be angels there
[54:12] and so then if god could open our eyes
[54:14] like he opened his eyes i believe that
[54:16] tonight we would literally see angels
[54:19] throughout this room
[54:21] but the problem is we're limited to
[54:22] these senses and so sometimes we just
[54:24] come to church we have problems where we
[54:26] don't feel the presence of god or
[54:28] whatever and we come to church and we're
[54:30] you know uh if we haven't really prayed
[54:32] up and whatnot
[54:33] is that right and it's just kind of
[54:35] going through the motions
[54:36] and this by god's grace we start
[54:38] worshiping the lord and then we start
[54:39] feeling the presence of the lord and
[54:42] amen
[54:43] but but whether we feel it don't feel it
[54:46] whether we see it or don't see it
[54:48] never changes the reality of god's word
[54:51] god's word is always true
[54:53] is that right
[54:55] and so now his eyes become open and now
[54:57] he's got a different perspective now he
[54:59] realizes something amen
[55:01] that they're not in trouble after all
[55:02] they're not they're not toast there's no
[55:04] problem here and now he's kind of
[55:06] interested and he's curious what's going
[55:08] to happen now he's looking at elijah
[55:10] going what is what are we going to do
[55:11] here now what's going to happen because
[55:12] he knows the outcome is going to be much
[55:14] different than what he thought it was
[55:16] going to be when he first came out amen
[55:18] praise the lord why don't we stand this
[55:20] evening and
[55:21] and we'll open up in the bibles here
[55:25] brother juan thank you for mentioning
[55:27] that about gehesa
[55:29] because i didn't know what to preach
[55:31] tonight
[55:35] i was like
[55:37] i'm toast
[55:39] [Music]
[55:41] come on lord help me
[55:43] amen genesis 18 and verse 1.
[55:47] so i just feel to just share a thought
[55:49] tonight on
[55:50] on the ministry of angels
[55:53] in genesis 18 and verse 1
[55:56] and the lord appeared unto him in the
[55:58] plains of mamrie
[55:59] and he sat in a tent
[56:01] door in the heat of the day so now
[56:03] remember now just don't read it too fast
[56:06] and the lord
[56:07] appeared
[56:09] elohim
[56:10] god in flesh
[56:13] the lord appeared
[56:15] the lord
[56:16] god
[56:18] walked on the earth in a flesh body
[56:21] with two angels and walked up to speak
[56:24] to abraham
[56:26] and he lift up his eyes and he looked
[56:28] and lo three men stood by him three men
[56:30] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[56:33] from the tent door and bowed himself
[56:35] toward the ground and said my lord if
[56:37] now i have found favor in thy sight past
[56:39] not away i pray thee from thy servant
[56:42] so heavenly father
[56:45] we pray lord that you would add the
[56:47] blessing to the reading of the word and
[56:50] but father tonight we pray that you'd
[56:52] help us to get out of the way
[56:54] that you'd preach the gospel lord
[56:56] through us
[56:57] that father we could hear lord god that
[56:59] you would hear the gospel through us
[57:01] and that father we could all
[57:03] have our faith lifted up into a higher
[57:05] realm
[57:06] that lord god as our prophet taught us
[57:08] through the scripture through the
[57:10] message lord that jesus christ is the
[57:12] same yesterday today and forever
[57:14] and then lord god if we could have the
[57:16] right perspective lord god
[57:18] and father we could
[57:20] move oh god with faith in our heart
[57:22] that father whatever might be ailing us
[57:25] tonight whether it be sickness whether
[57:26] it be discouragement
[57:28] father whatever it might be lord god we
[57:30] know that lord you can come on the scene
[57:33] and father you can move in a mighty way
[57:36] we present all of our needs to you
[57:38] tonight father we are singing the song
[57:40] through it all lord god we have been
[57:42] through many battles and many trials
[57:44] lord god but father somehow you brought
[57:45] us through every single one of them but
[57:47] tonight lord we want to present our
[57:49] needs to you tonight lord whatever it
[57:50] might be the different ones that were
[57:52] prayed for tonight lord we ask that you
[57:54] would come down in the mighty way and
[57:56] father we ask that you would visit this
[57:57] little church here tonight lord in a
[57:59] mighty way that the holy spirit could
[58:01] move as you promised where two or three
[58:03] were gathered in your midst father you
[58:05] would be there and lord god that's why
[58:07] we are here tonight we're not here to
[58:09] hear a man orientate lord god but we are
[58:11] here because we want to hear from you
[58:14] lord and father we just happen to
[58:16] believe the gospel that you would preach
[58:17] through men we believe the gospel in
[58:19] simplicity lord god we know lord that
[58:21] you're the same yesterday today and
[58:22] forever you haven't changed and father
[58:24] if you wanted to preach through the
[58:25] stars you could have if you wanted to
[58:26] preach through tape decks you could have
[58:28] but lord you preached through men
[58:30] and father tonight we gather together
[58:32] around father's throne and pray lord god
[58:34] that you'd break the bread of life to
[58:35] our hearts lift this up a little higher
[58:38] give us a little unction in our step
[58:39] lord god edify the body of christ we
[58:41] pray in jesus christ's name amen god
[58:44] bless you may be seated
[58:45] so we realize now the lord the lord
[58:47] comes down he visits abraham and two
[58:50] angelic beings come with him
[58:52] but what they do is very interesting
[58:54] there god has the ability to make a
[58:56] human body
[58:57] and uh
[58:59] that's pretty wild isn't it uh yet
[59:02] yet if we believe the bible you know
[59:04] then we believe all of the bible and we
[59:06] know that if god if three men walked up
[59:08] before them then uh god literally took
[59:11] as brother brown said the polish of the
[59:13] earth and the chemicals of the earth and
[59:14] he made three bodies and he stepped into
[59:16] one and two angels stepped in with him
[59:18] and they walked up so if he could do it
[59:20] then he can do it now so then if if god
[59:23] if god walked up to this man abraham and
[59:25] and there were three men and he looked
[59:27] and he saw three men
[59:28] his perspective is looking at three men
[59:30] coming three strangers are coming up to
[59:32] him
[59:33] and as they're coming up to him he's
[59:35] looking at them but then as soon as that
[59:36] one speaks
[59:38] he recognizes the voice and he knows
[59:40] that's god because he already knew god
[59:42] he already walked with god he already
[59:44] had a relationship with god and so as
[59:46] soon as god spoke he went my lord he
[59:49] knows who he is amen
[59:51] so then we realize now that god is doing
[59:55] something why does god doesn't waste his
[59:56] time he doesn't just do whatever he has
[59:58] purposes for what he's doing
[1:00:00] and he comes down so he starts to visit
[1:00:02] he's visiting earth he's visiting this
[1:00:04] man on earth
[1:00:05] hebrews 13 2 tells us that to be not
[1:00:08] forgetful to entertain strangers for
[1:00:10] thereby some have entertained angels
[1:00:12] unawares isn't that interesting so do
[1:00:14] you mean to tell me that even maybe
[1:00:16] right now there could be angels walking
[1:00:18] around in men's bodies
[1:00:20] do you believe that
[1:00:21] it's true the bible said that everybody
[1:00:23] you might entertain angels unawares of
[1:00:25] course we also know that this scripture
[1:00:26] is referring to men and women of god
[1:00:29] that you know we're angelic beings in
[1:00:30] the fact that we're messengers not
[1:00:32] angelic beings we're messengers angels a
[1:00:34] messenger
[1:00:35] but these are angelic beings as well and
[1:00:38] so we don't know how many angels are on
[1:00:41] earth how many angels are moving where
[1:00:43] they're at and what they're doing we
[1:00:44] don't know that but what we do know is
[1:00:47] that they're here amen people want to
[1:00:49] believe in sasquatch oh they can believe
[1:00:51] in a sasquatch they can believe in ufos
[1:00:53] but it's more difficult we're talking
[1:00:55] about this this afternoon it's more
[1:00:56] difficult for them to believe in angelic
[1:00:58] beings
[1:00:59] amen but yet it's just like we know it's
[1:01:01] difficult for them to believe that god
[1:01:02] is real is that right
[1:01:05] praise the lord brother brown says from
[1:01:06] the anointed ones at the end time he
[1:01:07] said i wasn't the one who that appeared
[1:01:09] down on the river i was only standing
[1:01:10] there when he appeared praise the lord
[1:01:13] so brother down on the river amen the
[1:01:15] angel of the lord even visit him
[1:01:17] and excuse me just like when ezekiel one
[1:01:19] day you know he's down by the river
[1:01:21] chiba
[1:01:22] and he had a visitation from angelic
[1:01:24] beings is that right
[1:01:25] he saw the will in the middle of the
[1:01:27] will and he saw the cherubims and so
[1:01:29] brother brown was down he says i wasn't
[1:01:30] the one that appeared down there on the
[1:01:32] river i was only standing there when he
[1:01:33] appeared
[1:01:34] now he's referring of course to the
[1:01:36] pillar of fire when the pillar of fire
[1:01:37] appeared brother branham was there amen
[1:01:39] he said i'm not the one that performs
[1:01:40] these things and foretells these things
[1:01:42] that happens as perfect as they are i'm
[1:01:44] only one that's near when he does it
[1:01:46] praise the lord i was only a voice that
[1:01:48] he used i just say it
[1:01:50] it wasn't what i knew it
[1:01:52] it's what i just surrendered myself to
[1:01:54] yes that he spoke through it isn't me it
[1:01:57] wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[1:01:59] the manifestation of the son of man
[1:02:01] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[1:02:04] the mystery that god unfolded it's not
[1:02:07] man it's not a man it's god praise the
[1:02:09] lord so we're not following a man we're
[1:02:11] following god not that brother
[1:02:13] brother is a man but we're following god
[1:02:15] the god that led brother branham
[1:02:17] he said the angel was not the son of man
[1:02:19] he was the messenger from the son of man
[1:02:21] the son of man is christ he's the one
[1:02:23] that you're feeding on you're not
[1:02:24] feeding on a man a man's words will fail
[1:02:27] but you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:02:28] word of the son of man
[1:02:30] amen so now we realize that elohim amen
[1:02:33] step down to visit abraham is that right
[1:02:35] but now we also realize that elohim in
[1:02:37] the last days in the end time days even
[1:02:40] even job said i believe that my god will
[1:02:42] stand on earth
[1:02:44] and in the last days amen elohim he
[1:02:47] comes down and he displays himself
[1:02:50] through the messenger of the hour amen
[1:02:52] praise the lord do you believe that the
[1:02:53] son of man ministry amen okay i'm at
[1:02:55] home here i knew i was because i know
[1:02:57] what brother juan believes
[1:02:59] so in the son of man ministry amen god
[1:03:01] visits the church again jesus christ the
[1:03:03] same yesterday today and forever amen
[1:03:06] because it wasn't brother brown that
[1:03:07] could foretell those things it wasn't
[1:03:08] brother branham they could say your name
[1:03:10] is
[1:03:11] you're from address you're from this and
[1:03:12] that but god can do that god knows you
[1:03:15] god knows what you think god knows where
[1:03:17] you live god knows everything that's
[1:03:19] going on in your life and god cares
[1:03:21] about you
[1:03:23] god cares he's very interested and very
[1:03:25] concerned about your everyday life
[1:03:28] and he was able to tell him exactly
[1:03:29] where they came from who they were and
[1:03:31] everything about them praise the lord
[1:03:34] so my question is if we can believe that
[1:03:37] and we do believe that
[1:03:38] why is it that people struggle right now
[1:03:41] believers even struggle amen that angels
[1:03:44] can be part of our everyday life that
[1:03:47] angels can actually be all over the
[1:03:49] earth right now doing things
[1:03:52] amen and we know that they're appearing
[1:03:54] in the skies because brother branham
[1:03:55] told us those are and those are visited
[1:03:57] visitating angels
[1:03:59] praise the lord hallelujah so not that
[1:04:02] god is we don't want to ever start
[1:04:04] thinking that god is way beyond the
[1:04:05] milky way
[1:04:08] where's the kingdom of god at where's
[1:04:09] the heaven of god where's the where's
[1:04:11] the where is thank you brother steve
[1:04:13] he's patting the ark
[1:04:15] the ark the heart the heart is the ark
[1:04:17] the heart is the dwelling place of god
[1:04:18] god is here right now god is here in a
[1:04:20] many member body all over this church
[1:04:23] you brought god to church you brought
[1:04:24] god to church i brought god to church
[1:04:26] god is here
[1:04:28] amen so then therefore really i mean if
[1:04:30] we really want to go kind of crazy with
[1:04:32] it we can walk out we know that we are
[1:04:34] also when people greet us and talk to us
[1:04:36] i mean could you imagine if they really
[1:04:37] knew who we were
[1:04:39] if they really knew that god was living
[1:04:40] in us when you pull up at the hotel they
[1:04:42] wouldn't make you carry your own bags i
[1:04:44] mean the red carpet would come out and
[1:04:47] and
[1:04:48] i mean literally they would they would
[1:04:49] meet you there and and walk you in and
[1:04:52] oh yeah they would
[1:04:54] but the thing of it is they just don't
[1:04:55] know what's going on
[1:04:57] praise the lord
[1:04:59] so stay with me amen
[1:05:01] i'm only laying a foundation i want you
[1:05:02] just to stay with me so in this the
[1:05:04] message expectations
[1:05:06] brother brown says i believe that
[1:05:07] everyone
[1:05:08] that the angels of god watch over us how
[1:05:10] many believe that
[1:05:12] the angels of god are watching over you
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:16] and a matter of fact you have an angel
[1:05:18] he says and i believe that jesus said
[1:05:20] their angels always behold the face of
[1:05:22] my father which is in heaven
[1:05:25] so you have a guardian angel
[1:05:27] brother brown told us he said when
[1:05:28] you're born again you've heard from your
[1:05:30] theophany and your theophany is a word
[1:05:32] body
[1:05:33] amen and you have a guardian angel you
[1:05:35] have angels watching over you praise the
[1:05:37] lord
[1:05:38] thank god for the token flying the token
[1:05:40] to the home amen creating an atmosphere
[1:05:42] where god is happy to dwell and the
[1:05:44] angels of god are there amen
[1:05:46] so the angel of the lord
[1:05:48] he was with continually with brother
[1:05:50] branham
[1:05:52] and he told brother branham i have come
[1:05:53] from the presence of the lord
[1:05:55] is that right
[1:05:57] so now we know that
[1:05:59] at least i know that many people have
[1:06:00] seen angels i've talked to brothers that
[1:06:02] have seen angels i've talked to
[1:06:04] believers that have seen the pillar of
[1:06:05] fire
[1:06:06] and they're and angels are a real part
[1:06:08] of our life
[1:06:10] they work for the lord amen
[1:06:13] and brother battle went so far this is
[1:06:15] how much he walked in that super natural
[1:06:18] realm
[1:06:19] and saw angels and he there's a lot of
[1:06:21] visit him all the time and
[1:06:24] he he makes a statement he says that if
[1:06:27] you would keep your mind if the
[1:06:28] believers would keep their mind on the
[1:06:30] lord and on angels and the supernatural
[1:06:34] he said angels would appear to them
[1:06:37] to you he said
[1:06:39] so angels are here
[1:06:41] but they're in a faster dimension
[1:06:44] so here we are in the third dimension
[1:06:46] time light timer matter
[1:06:48] we're in the third dimension and our
[1:06:49] eyes are limited to only see a certain
[1:06:52] portion of the of the light spectrum we
[1:06:55] can only see so much but there's a
[1:06:57] fourth dimension a fifth dimension a
[1:06:58] sixth dimension in the seventh dimension
[1:07:01] but we can't see into them so then
[1:07:02] therefore god has given us something
[1:07:05] that we might tap into those dimensions
[1:07:07] and that is called faith
[1:07:09] and that's why it's so important for us
[1:07:12] to believe what we hear to believe the
[1:07:15] word of god i mean to believe the
[1:07:17] message
[1:07:18] it's so important for us not to be
[1:07:20] looking at circumstances so much
[1:07:22] amen but to be able to look beyond the
[1:07:24] circumstances look beyond the heart you
[1:07:26] know the trials of life and be able to
[1:07:29] think now wait a second
[1:07:31] this is not the end this is not the
[1:07:32] final story
[1:07:34] amen there is a god present there is a
[1:07:37] god here that can help me just like when
[1:07:39] when uh daniel got thrown in the lion's
[1:07:41] den
[1:07:42] amen it was it was certain death
[1:07:45] but yet then the lord came down
[1:07:48] and closed the mouth of the lion
[1:07:51] an angel came in his time of need
[1:07:56] from this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:07:58] brother brown says look hanging in
[1:07:59] washington dc tonight is the picture of
[1:08:01] the angel of the lord
[1:08:04] do you believe that picture is actually
[1:08:06] a picture of the angel of the lord amen
[1:08:08] i do
[1:08:11] i believe it's the pillar of fire
[1:08:13] and i believe it's the angel of the lord
[1:08:15] and i believe it's a picture i mean as
[1:08:17] he was in the light right
[1:08:19] you understand
[1:08:20] luke let's look in luke chapter one
[1:08:26] hallelujah
[1:08:28] luke 1 and verse 26.
[1:08:36] well i like this bible big letters
[1:08:41] luke 20 luke 1 chap chapter 1 verse 26
[1:08:47] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[1:08:50] was sent from god
[1:08:51] unto a city of galilee named nazareth
[1:08:54] to ver to a virgin a spouse to a man
[1:08:56] whose name was joseph
[1:08:57] of the house of david and the virgin's
[1:08:59] name was mary
[1:09:02] and the angel came in unto her and said
[1:09:04] hail thou art thou that art highly
[1:09:06] favored
[1:09:07] the lord is with thee blessed art thou
[1:09:09] among women
[1:09:12] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[1:09:14] his saying and cast in her mind what
[1:09:16] manner of salutation should this be
[1:09:18] and the angel said unto her fear not
[1:09:20] mary now remember now
[1:09:23] we're reading about an angel talking to
[1:09:24] a human being
[1:09:28] we're sitting here reading about a a
[1:09:30] girl named mary
[1:09:32] and there's an angel standing there
[1:09:33] talking to her
[1:09:38] and if he's the same yesterday
[1:09:40] today and forever
[1:09:45] this might help you
[1:09:47] there's a brother and i don't know if
[1:09:48] you heard his testimony and i can't i
[1:09:49] don't even remember his name
[1:09:51] but he was in far east siberia
[1:09:53] and he was looking
[1:09:55] he had got some message books of brother
[1:09:56] branham and he was reading them and he
[1:09:58] was looking for them
[1:09:59] and oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm ahead of
[1:10:01] myself
[1:10:02] he was praying
[1:10:04] lord i want to know the truth
[1:10:06] help me know the truth and the night
[1:10:08] that he went to bed i might have shared
[1:10:09] this before but i don't know but the
[1:10:10] night that he went to bed all of a
[1:10:12] sudden he got woke up because something
[1:10:13] was pulling his hair
[1:10:15] and he got up and he looked
[1:10:18] and went back to sleep same thing
[1:10:20] happened again something was pulling his
[1:10:21] hair he woke up again
[1:10:23] and when he woke up
[1:10:26] there was a light shining on the wall
[1:10:28] and the name william marion branham was
[1:10:30] on the wall
[1:10:32] and the angel was there and the angel
[1:10:34] told him find william marion branham
[1:10:37] and sometime went by and he got invited
[1:10:39] to some meetings and that's when he had
[1:10:40] found some message books and got invited
[1:10:41] some meetings and he was in uh over back
[1:10:44] over there by the ukraine area i believe
[1:10:46] it was and brother lonnie jenkins was
[1:10:47] there and brother lonnie jenkins was
[1:10:48] given his was ministering and every time
[1:10:50] he would say the name william branham or
[1:10:51] brother branham this guy would jump up
[1:10:53] and excited
[1:10:54] wow
[1:10:56] and so he went to him and asked him he
[1:10:57] said why are you so excited it seemed
[1:10:58] like every time i mentioned brother
[1:10:59] brown's name you jump up and he told him
[1:11:01] this testimony i was praying for the
[1:11:03] truth and an angel met me
[1:11:05] an angel came to him and woke him up and
[1:11:08] shook his head and said go find this
[1:11:10] messenger are you with me
[1:11:13] so then there therefore we know that
[1:11:15] there are angels amen
[1:11:17] all around
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:20] sometimes when you feel the presence of
[1:11:22] the lord i remember i was sitting there
[1:11:24] and and and brother uh uh uh billy paul
[1:11:27] was was testifying and he was he was
[1:11:30] saying every time since i saw the angel
[1:11:32] he tells about how he saw the angel you
[1:11:34] remember the story when brother branham
[1:11:35] was there and the angel of the lord was
[1:11:37] in the room and he said can i wake up my
[1:11:38] son to see you and he said yes can i
[1:11:40] wake up my brother he said no
[1:11:42] can i wake up my son he woke up brother
[1:11:44] billy paul he put the pillow by billy
[1:11:45] paul's head and he said uh son the angel
[1:11:48] that daddy's told you about you remember
[1:11:49] the angel how i told you about the angel
[1:11:50] yeah he goes well he's standing in the
[1:11:51] corner over there and he says i'm gonna
[1:11:55] remove the pillow and you look he
[1:11:57] removed the pillow and when he looked
[1:11:58] billy paul grabbed his dad and just
[1:12:00] shook
[1:12:01] and his dad said son don't worry he
[1:12:03] won't hurt you and billy paul said there
[1:12:05] was a man
[1:12:07] he didn't have wings
[1:12:08] he was standing there in the corner by
[1:12:10] the window
[1:12:11] and he was about six foot tall and he
[1:12:13] had blonde hair
[1:12:14] amen and the light was glaring radiating
[1:12:17] off of him
[1:12:18] you know how many remember the story
[1:12:20] and then all of a sudden he said the
[1:12:22] angel turned into like a pillar of fire
[1:12:24] like a light
[1:12:25] and it went out the window yeah amen and
[1:12:28] so he was telling that story
[1:12:30] and then he made the statement
[1:12:32] he was saying and ever since i've seen
[1:12:34] that angel i know when he's here
[1:12:37] praise the lord
[1:12:39] and i was sitting there thinking
[1:12:41] because the presence of the lord was
[1:12:42] very strong
[1:12:44] and i was thinking he's here
[1:12:46] i can sense him he's here
[1:12:48] and then all of a sudden billy paul says
[1:12:50] and he's here
[1:12:52] amen so what am i saying this is what
[1:12:54] i'm saying that there are people that
[1:12:56] can see angels and there are angelic
[1:12:58] activity and there are things that
[1:12:59] happen amen and i can go into story
[1:13:02] after story about different believers
[1:13:04] seeing this pillar of fire this one was
[1:13:05] preaching the pillar of fire amen i was
[1:13:08] i was testifying to my brother one time
[1:13:09] he said i saw the pillar of fire all
[1:13:11] around you amen and so what what i'm
[1:13:14] saying is that there's another realm
[1:13:15] that we don't always see but we can
[1:13:18] always enter it through faith
[1:13:20] we don't always see it we can't maybe
[1:13:23] always sense it with our sight our
[1:13:25] feelings and everything
[1:13:27] but we know it's there and we have been
[1:13:29] given the access
[1:13:31] to enter into that atmosphere through
[1:13:34] faith
[1:13:35] because everything in that kingdom
[1:13:37] operates through faith
[1:13:38] and praise the lord amen
[1:13:41] so now here's this angel speaking to
[1:13:43] mary in verse 30.
[1:13:46] and the angel said unto her fear not
[1:13:48] mary for thou hast found favor with god
[1:13:52] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:13:55] womb and bring forth a son and so call
[1:13:57] his name
[1:13:58] jesus
[1:14:00] verse 34
[1:14:02] then said mary unto the angel
[1:14:04] how shall these how shall this be seeing
[1:14:06] i know not a man
[1:14:07] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:14:10] the holy ghost shall come upon thee and
[1:14:11] the power of the highest shall
[1:14:12] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[1:14:15] thing which shall be born in thee shall
[1:14:17] be called the son of god.
[1:14:20] and behold thy cousin elizabeth
[1:14:22] she hath also conceived a son in her old
[1:14:24] age and this
[1:14:26] and this is the sixth month with her who
[1:14:29] was called barren
[1:14:32] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[1:14:34] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[1:14:35] lord be it unto me according to that
[1:14:37] word and the angel departed from her
[1:14:40] matthew chapter 1.
[1:14:42] we're just reading scriptures about
[1:14:44] angels
[1:14:45] angels
[1:14:46] visiting people
[1:14:48] angels talking to people matthew 1 18.
[1:14:52] the lord jesus amen that's birth now the
[1:14:54] birth of jesus christ was on this wise
[1:14:56] when as his mother mary was a spouse to
[1:14:58] joseph before they came together she was
[1:15:00] found child of the holy ghost
[1:15:02] then joseph her husband but god can do
[1:15:03] anything yes
[1:15:06] how does he put how does he implant a
[1:15:07] seed into a wound
[1:15:09] he can do it
[1:15:11] do you believe that brother wesley is
[1:15:12] the lord god can put a seed in a woman
[1:15:14] and make and take a virgin
[1:15:16] and bring forth a child
[1:15:18] an angel because because god is real and
[1:15:20] because god is here and he can send down
[1:15:23] an angel and
[1:15:24] and the angel can go talk to a person
[1:15:27] glory to god amen are you with me so far
[1:15:30] yeah i mean you should be because you
[1:15:32] met god
[1:15:33] you met god on the back side of the
[1:15:34] desert of your heart
[1:15:36] if anybody knows god in this age it's
[1:15:38] the believer
[1:15:39] the believer has testimony after
[1:15:40] testimony about of what god has done and
[1:15:43] that god is in their life and how god
[1:15:45] brought me through this situation and
[1:15:46] god brought me through that situation
[1:15:48] and you can't take you can't shake them
[1:15:50] from it you can't you can't get them say
[1:15:52] well i don't think that really happened
[1:15:53] there's i don't care if you think it
[1:15:55] happened or not i was there
[1:15:58] i was there
[1:15:59] [Applause]
[1:16:00] i don't care if you believe my
[1:16:01] testimonies but i believe them because i
[1:16:04] was
[1:16:04] there praise the lord
[1:16:08] so the birth of the word the prophecy
[1:16:11] behold the virgin shall conceive
[1:16:13] was coming into reality
[1:16:16] when jesus christ was born
[1:16:20] that prophecy now
[1:16:22] here he is the word the the baby's
[1:16:24] getting ready to be born
[1:16:26] all kinds of things are happening on
[1:16:28] earth
[1:16:29] and now there's an increase in angelic
[1:16:31] activity
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:35] because god was getting ready to come
[1:16:37] down
[1:16:38] and he had to he had to make a body for
[1:16:40] himself
[1:16:41] so when the body would rise up he said i
[1:16:43] i have uh iconis in him down a little
[1:16:46] lower than the angels so god had
[1:16:48] prepared a body for himself
[1:16:51] amen so when the first advent of christ
[1:16:53] came all of a sudden
[1:16:55] there were angelic beings beings moving
[1:16:57] around
[1:16:58] amen
[1:16:59] when the birth of the word when mary was
[1:17:01] there all of a sudden now
[1:17:04] there's three magis that are studying
[1:17:07] the skies
[1:17:08] and three stars start to come together
[1:17:12] and they make a journey they start
[1:17:13] making a journey
[1:17:14] they're traveling
[1:17:16] amen it took them a couple years to get
[1:17:18] there but they're traveling
[1:17:20] when jesus is born
[1:17:22] there's angels all over the place the
[1:17:24] shepherds are out in the field they look
[1:17:25] up in the skies there's angels
[1:17:27] everywhere
[1:17:29] because now they can see them
[1:17:31] because something's very important is
[1:17:33] happening on earth
[1:17:35] amen
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:41] excuse me
[1:17:46] so there's an increase in angelic
[1:17:48] activity
[1:17:50] and not only did gabriel come and speak
[1:17:52] with mary but then gabriel spoke with
[1:17:54] joseph
[1:17:56] and all these things are happening
[1:17:59] so anytime the lord is turning a corner
[1:18:02] or a new dispensation amen something
[1:18:05] very important
[1:18:06] like the birth of the word
[1:18:08] there's angelic activity all over the
[1:18:10] earth so now we with this this just jump
[1:18:13] forward into our day our age
[1:18:17] and now the word is getting ready to be
[1:18:19] broke open in 1963 yes
[1:18:22] and all of a sudden there's a man that
[1:18:24] comes out
[1:18:25] amen talking about the angel of the lord
[1:18:28] telling stories like when i was born
[1:18:30] there was a light that came in the room
[1:18:31] and hovered over my crib
[1:18:33] praise the lord amen and it was years
[1:18:35] later it was they took the picture in
[1:18:37] the sam houston coliseum in 1950
[1:18:41] years later
[1:18:43] when
[1:18:45] he says look church you see i wasn't
[1:18:47] lying to you
[1:18:50] praise god amen
[1:19:00] god help us
[1:19:02] remember brother man laid back on us on
[1:19:04] his bed and he he closed his eyes and
[1:19:06] the angel said would you like to see
[1:19:08] behind the curtain of time
[1:19:10] hallelujah
[1:19:13] and he said i think it would really help
[1:19:14] me
[1:19:16] and god took him beyond the curtain of
[1:19:18] time
[1:19:20] an angel's standing there and he's
[1:19:22] looking at all these people
[1:19:24] just as real as you and me
[1:19:26] in a different dimension
[1:19:28] just in a different dimension
[1:19:31] amen
[1:19:32] thank you jesus
[1:19:34] praise the lord amen so brother branson
[1:19:36] was talking about all the signs the
[1:19:37] stars coming together in an infant
[1:19:39] church being born on earth there's an
[1:19:41] increase in angelic activity
[1:19:43] amen the pillar of fire returns to the
[1:19:45] church the angel of the lord is with the
[1:19:46] church and all these things are taking
[1:19:48] place and brother branham one place he's
[1:19:49] preaching or he had it he had a he had a
[1:19:52] prayer line
[1:19:53] and this woman was there and after
[1:19:55] brother branham left she was just
[1:19:56] standing there staring
[1:19:58] and her husband came up and said
[1:19:59] sweetheart are you okay what's going on
[1:20:02] and she says did you see that man
[1:20:05] next to brother branham
[1:20:08] he goes no
[1:20:12] she said that was the angel
[1:20:15] and he told me
[1:20:17] when brother brown was praying for me
[1:20:19] the man told me
[1:20:21] doesn't brother branham look frail
[1:20:26] and then she's like yeah
[1:20:28] he says brother brown is very tired
[1:20:33] after this is over tell brother branham
[1:20:36] you know what happened so she told her
[1:20:37] husband i got to tell brother branham
[1:20:38] she tells where the brown starts crying
[1:20:43] so the angel
[1:20:45] was there
[1:20:46] now i've heard people
[1:20:47] say i was there when he said the angel
[1:20:49] was there i didn't see it
[1:20:51] it doesn't negate
[1:20:53] it doesn't negate anything are you
[1:20:55] hearing me
[1:20:56] it doesn't mean anything
[1:20:58] you're sitting here tonight in church
[1:21:00] and like well i don't see an angel
[1:21:02] i don't see honestly i don't see one
[1:21:03] right now
[1:21:05] but i know he's here i know they're here
[1:21:06] i mean i know the angels are here
[1:21:08] i know the supernatural's here i know
[1:21:10] that if we can all collectively by faith
[1:21:12] move up into that channel amen
[1:21:14] especially even through the weekend when
[1:21:16] we can move up into that channel we can
[1:21:17] get whatever we need from god
[1:21:19] if we can believe we can have anything
[1:21:20] that we need the fountain is open
[1:21:22] everything is there for us the healings
[1:21:24] are already paid i mean everything is
[1:21:26] it's already done the song said it's
[1:21:27] already done
[1:21:28] amen and but yet sometimes we are so
[1:21:30] fearful sometimes we are so doubtful
[1:21:32] sometimes we have all these issues and
[1:21:34] yet we forget we become like a giza when
[1:21:36] we should be more like elisha when we
[1:21:39] know that the angels of god are here and
[1:21:41] whatever i need i can receive it tonight
[1:21:45] not because brother flint's preaching
[1:21:49] no way
[1:21:50] but because we believe the promise of
[1:21:52] god
[1:21:54] he's still a healer
[1:21:56] he's still a deliverer
[1:21:58] he's still a mighty god
[1:22:00] if you've got pain he's the pain taker
[1:22:02] amen if you need salvation he is the
[1:22:04] savior
[1:22:06] whatever you need you got it tonight
[1:22:09] don't worry about all these antifa's and
[1:22:11] all this craziness around this world
[1:22:13] don't worry about this that satan's even
[1:22:15] coming to a climax they're coming to a
[1:22:17] climax but we need to start coming to a
[1:22:20] climax within the spirit of god in the
[1:22:23] realm of god
[1:22:26] how are you going to stir god to meet
[1:22:28] your need by your faith
[1:22:32] only by faith
[1:22:35] praise the lord amen
[1:22:37] so anytime god turns a corner
[1:22:40] he starts or have a message he starts to
[1:22:42] send angels
[1:22:44] because god's his own interpreter god
[1:22:46] uses men
[1:22:47] men don't use god
[1:22:50] god uses men
[1:22:53] and god is not going to push play on a
[1:22:54] tape deck and obey the prophet right
[1:22:57] god
[1:22:58] uses men and men obey god
[1:23:03] praise the lord
[1:23:06] hallelujah
[1:23:08] so
[1:23:09] here we go now we get to a junction of
[1:23:10] time excuse me
[1:23:15] and god starts to use
[1:23:18] sends down angels
[1:23:21] before israel crossed the sea
[1:23:24] crossed over the jordan the angel of the
[1:23:26] lord met joshua claiming to be the
[1:23:28] captain of the host
[1:23:30] is that right yes
[1:23:33] so why would we think any different than
[1:23:34] the angel of god visiting brother
[1:23:36] branham
[1:23:37] when it's time for the infant church to
[1:23:39] be born
[1:23:41] when it's time for the breaking of the
[1:23:43] seals
[1:23:45] amen
[1:23:46] angelic activity starts to increase yes
[1:23:50] so before the bride could receive the
[1:23:51] open book the lamb had to take the book
[1:23:54] himself
[1:23:56] and before the lamb could be born
[1:23:58] amen angels came to earth
[1:24:01] and started moving around talking doing
[1:24:03] things
[1:24:04] doing the lamb amen
[1:24:07] was going to come forth to break the
[1:24:08] seals now remember the seven thunders of
[1:24:11] the seven seals where do they sound from
[1:24:13] not heaven
[1:24:14] they sound from the earth
[1:24:16] but only the lamb can open the seal
[1:24:19] so then the lamb's got to come to earth
[1:24:22] the lamb has to be on earth
[1:24:25] and so since the lamb is coming to the
[1:24:27] earth
[1:24:28] we're talking about 63. angels have got
[1:24:30] to start moving around
[1:24:32] they're doing something
[1:24:35] because god they are god's attendance
[1:24:37] they are god's helpers they are there
[1:24:38] with god amen
[1:24:40] praise the lord amen
[1:24:44] before samson was born an angel visited
[1:24:47] his parents manoa and his wife
[1:24:49] they just walk out there and all of a
[1:24:51] sudden the wife comes back he said
[1:24:53] my an angel visited me
[1:24:56] if it was nowadays well you're getting
[1:24:57] crazy
[1:24:58] what are you talking about
[1:25:00] but not manoa
[1:25:02] and i hope not you
[1:25:04] but you say
[1:25:06] what
[1:25:07] let's go out and take him some stuff and
[1:25:08] meet with him
[1:25:10] and he comes back
[1:25:11] to give them a message
[1:25:13] before gideon
[1:25:14] liberated israel and angel visited him
[1:25:16] yep that's right
[1:25:19] i love what these angels say look at
[1:25:20] mary you're a woman a a favor found
[1:25:23] favor with god
[1:25:24] you think mary thinks she knew she had
[1:25:26] favor with god
[1:25:29] and gideon
[1:25:30] you're a man mighty man of elder he was
[1:25:32] scared to death what do you mean i'm a
[1:25:33] mad amount of valor
[1:25:34] you see we don't even know our own
[1:25:36] selves yes
[1:25:37] sometimes we don't even realize who we
[1:25:39] are
[1:25:40] we're so worried about all of our
[1:25:42] complexes and our our
[1:25:44] deficiencies we forget that there's a
[1:25:46] mighty god living inside of his church
[1:25:51] amen
[1:25:53] mary and joseph they received attention
[1:25:55] from angel
[1:25:56] brother brown was born a pillar of fire
[1:25:58] come in the room
[1:25:59] the angel visited him many times told
[1:26:01] him he was born for a purpose
[1:26:03] amen before the seven seals could be
[1:26:05] opened seven angels appeared to the
[1:26:07] prophet on mount sunset yeah
[1:26:10] praise the lord so this activity on
[1:26:12] earth starts to pick up
[1:26:16] it is the rising of the sun now remember
[1:26:17] now it doesn't matter if the
[1:26:18] denomination caught it
[1:26:20] it wasn't sent to them
[1:26:22] it was sent to you yes
[1:26:24] amen
[1:26:28] all those rabbis didn't know what was
[1:26:30] happening with mary they're just like
[1:26:32] mary and joseph oh this is a bad deal
[1:26:34] how do we cover this thing up that's
[1:26:35] right
[1:26:38] yes
[1:26:39] it is the rising of the sun a vision
[1:26:41] that i had
[1:26:42] here at the tabernacle of leaving
[1:26:43] indiana to arizona
[1:26:45] where i was to meet
[1:26:47] in the form of a period pyramid
[1:26:50] seven angels
[1:26:52] and draw it in the skies a shape of a
[1:26:54] pyramid
[1:26:55] in the same constellation of angels that
[1:26:57] appeared
[1:27:00] so this constellation of angels
[1:27:02] they come down the white wig just like
[1:27:04] in revelation said that he's covered the
[1:27:06] white wig
[1:27:08] they come down brother brown's hunting
[1:27:10] in coronado forest he's running along
[1:27:13] the blast takes place all of a sudden
[1:27:15] he's standing there
[1:27:17] and he's looking at not one angel
[1:27:20] seven
[1:27:21] seven angels like men standing on earth
[1:27:25] sure
[1:27:27] now you know why the devil wants to
[1:27:29] fight that cloud so much yeah what is
[1:27:32] the attraction on the mountain
[1:27:34] the other day standing there turn the
[1:27:36] picture to the right and there's jesus
[1:27:39] remember now he had the white wig and he
[1:27:41] goes down he says to confirm the message
[1:27:44] there's a light of the evening time he
[1:27:46] said what's it all about he said the
[1:27:48] white wig upon him
[1:27:49] as we talked in revelations 1
[1:27:52] he says the angels themselves was the
[1:27:53] wig
[1:27:55] amen
[1:27:56] so now here these angels are and they
[1:27:58] meet with him
[1:28:00] praise the lord amen
[1:28:04] i don't get myself away from my notes
[1:28:06] too much here but
[1:28:08] i'm trying to
[1:28:11] okay so in
[1:28:13] in 1963
[1:28:15] before this is getting ready to happen
[1:28:18] he's get these visions and he's telling
[1:28:20] about the visions so when it comes to
[1:28:22] pass we will know
[1:28:24] yes and he's standing there
[1:28:26] and there's seven angels
[1:28:29] talking to him
[1:28:30] and he said in the seventh angel
[1:28:33] was one i always wondered about yes
[1:28:42] so i always wondered about that seventh
[1:28:43] angel
[1:28:47] now
[1:28:48] just for a minute
[1:28:49] let's think before the seals could be
[1:28:51] open
[1:28:52] because only the lamb could open these
[1:28:54] hills
[1:28:58] the lamb was there
[1:29:01] and the call comes forth
[1:29:03] he's got to take the book
[1:29:06] amen
[1:29:08] and he's got to come to open the book
[1:29:12] so in revelations 10 the angel comes
[1:29:15] down
[1:29:17] seventh utters utter their voices
[1:29:20] so we have seven angelic beings
[1:29:22] amen coming forth in the age
[1:29:27] and we realize that this is part of the
[1:29:30] mystery
[1:29:31] the secret
[1:29:33] so the seven angels amen they were his
[1:29:35] wig
[1:29:36] and he's what's happening the point i'm
[1:29:39] trying to make is what's happening is
[1:29:40] god
[1:29:41] is condescending down the mighty angel
[1:29:44] to put one foot on the land one put on
[1:29:46] one foot on the sea
[1:29:49] to take authority over the church
[1:29:52] amen amen are you hearing me
[1:29:55] but those seven thunders those are seven
[1:29:58] angelic beings
[1:30:00] amen
[1:30:02] so now this mighty angel comes down the
[1:30:04] wig is there the pictures took
[1:30:08] amen you turn the picture to the right
[1:30:10] you see christ right
[1:30:12] the revelation is the mystery of christ
[1:30:15] amen
[1:30:16] these seven angels are connected with
[1:30:18] this seventh seal and brother says from
[1:30:20] the message the seventh seal
[1:30:23] now the voice of that great thunder and
[1:30:24] the mission
[1:30:25] that was
[1:30:26] brought here has been revealed
[1:30:29] and proven that it was of god
[1:30:31] he said i knew not these seals
[1:30:33] and they've been revealed this week
[1:30:35] did anybody think of that of those now
[1:30:37] listen to what he says of those seven
[1:30:38] angels
[1:30:40] being this
[1:30:41] this being the message that was coming
[1:30:43] forth
[1:30:45] so now angelic activity is taking place
[1:30:49] because god's gonna do the greatest
[1:30:51] thing he's ever done on earth
[1:30:53] he's gonna
[1:30:54] finish the mystery of god
[1:30:57] he's gonna break forth the seals to
[1:30:59] finish the mystery of god to show
[1:31:02] everybody his bride i mean to show his
[1:31:04] bride who he is
[1:31:06] to give them a message that when they
[1:31:09] see who he is they can recognize who
[1:31:11] they are
[1:31:12] because they came from the same source
[1:31:16] glory to god amen
[1:31:18] so you're not just sitting here a sinner
[1:31:20] by god's grace saved
[1:31:23] are you hearing me though you are a
[1:31:24] sinner by god's great save
[1:31:26] but you're much more than that because
[1:31:28] you are people that when you heard the
[1:31:31] word
[1:31:32] something in you struck
[1:31:34] and you knew that's nothing but the
[1:31:37] truth and it brought a presence of god
[1:31:39] into your life and you don't even
[1:31:41] realize it but angels started moving
[1:31:44] around your life angels started watching
[1:31:47] over you
[1:31:49] a sister driving down in anchorage she's
[1:31:51] driving up she's getting ready to she
[1:31:52] has to stop life everything's clear she
[1:31:54] starts to give the gas starts to go
[1:31:56] forward an angel screams at her stop the
[1:31:59] car
[1:32:01] big old semi
[1:32:04] angels
[1:32:06] are watching
[1:32:07] over you
[1:32:09] angels are here every single day why
[1:32:12] because you're the ones that receive the
[1:32:14] message you're the ones that have come
[1:32:16] underneath the wing of the holy spirit
[1:32:22] hallelujah
[1:32:24] amen
[1:32:26] so here again now an increase of angelic
[1:32:28] activity
[1:32:29] because the seven seals mystery book
[1:32:32] the seven seal mystery from the throne
[1:32:33] room was getting ready to be revealed
[1:32:36] the lamb was coming to open the seals
[1:32:39] hallelujah
[1:32:40] what a great event it wasn't a metaphor
[1:32:43] it's not an allegory
[1:32:45] it was a literal happening of god
[1:32:48] visiting the earth
[1:32:50] praise the lord
[1:32:53] hallelujah
[1:32:55] the lamb would open the seven sill book
[1:32:57] of redemption
[1:32:59] so these seven beings
[1:33:01] these seven angelic beings come down
[1:33:03] with a blast and met brother branham
[1:33:06] not just in a vision but it was a
[1:33:07] reality form
[1:33:09] seven angelic beings come down to talk
[1:33:11] with the prophet
[1:33:13] amen
[1:33:14] he said here if i'm trying to do a god
[1:33:16] of service he says the whole earth shook
[1:33:18] everywhere rocks that size i don't know
[1:33:21] what size
[1:33:24] that size i don't know
[1:33:26] it wasn't there
[1:33:27] i haven't heard a brother say i don't
[1:33:29] know
[1:33:30] but i do know that the rocks shook
[1:33:31] everywhere
[1:33:32] right
[1:33:33] and that size rocks rolled down
[1:33:36] dust flying like that
[1:33:38] and i looked
[1:33:40] and standing before me
[1:33:42] stood seven angels
[1:33:46] that's the message we're in
[1:33:48] this is the god all god is the god of
[1:33:50] abraham isaac and jacob our god is the
[1:33:53] god of william mary and pratham
[1:33:55] we're not in some denominational
[1:33:56] nonsense we have been called out by the
[1:33:58] living god amen
[1:34:01] and every word in the bible is true
[1:34:04] where do our theory would gather
[1:34:06] together in my name i will be there
[1:34:09] i don't care if you feel it i don't care
[1:34:11] what's happening but you must believe it
[1:34:15] and if you can believe it
[1:34:17] your high blood pressure will leave
[1:34:20] your sickness will go away
[1:34:22] you're walking into your hill's body
[1:34:25] amen if you can believe it then you know
[1:34:27] that when you're prayed for you it's
[1:34:29] over with it's done it's a healed it's a
[1:34:31] finished work
[1:34:32] amen and now your confession changes and
[1:34:34] now you're confessing the word how are
[1:34:36] you confessing the word because i
[1:34:38] believe what it's saying
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:42] praise the lord
[1:34:43] but i say lord god almighty help us
[1:34:47] open our eyes let us see the host of
[1:34:49] heaven let us see the angel of god let
[1:34:52] us see these things amen because it
[1:34:54] would help our faith so much amen
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:00] little brother back in december
[1:35:03] would have been 29 2020.
[1:35:06] coveted hit the church in anchorage
[1:35:09] several of us got sick
[1:35:11] but one brother went to the hospital and
[1:35:14] he was then dying in the emergency room
[1:35:16] or in the icu
[1:35:18] and it was not looking good
[1:35:21] and basically it looked like he was
[1:35:23] going to die
[1:35:24] we already had a couple deaths in the
[1:35:26] church that year and i was praying i
[1:35:28] said lord please
[1:35:30] spare my brother
[1:35:31] i said lord this church can handle
[1:35:32] another death spare my brother everybody
[1:35:35] around the world was praying
[1:35:37] and we were praying for this brother
[1:35:38] brother brian amos
[1:35:41] and all of a sudden
[1:35:43] he's laying in there
[1:35:44] when he's getting worse and worse and
[1:35:47] worse
[1:35:49] that night early in the morning
[1:35:51] an angel visited him
[1:35:54] and an angel stood before him and the
[1:35:55] angel told him
[1:35:57] you're going to be fine
[1:36:01] the very next morning the doctor came in
[1:36:03] and the nurse said look at this and the
[1:36:05] doctor said i can't believe it things
[1:36:07] are turning around
[1:36:08] and god brought him out of the clutches
[1:36:10] of death
[1:36:11] when i picked him up at the hospital you
[1:36:14] should see a man that was scared to
[1:36:16] death
[1:36:17] it took a while i said brother don't
[1:36:19] fear don't fear stop fearing
[1:36:21] you don't have to fear this thing
[1:36:23] because greater is he that's in you than
[1:36:25] he that's in the world
[1:36:26] the devil didn't beat him he beat the
[1:36:28] devil
[1:36:30] amen by the power of the cross of
[1:36:32] calvary
[1:36:33] glory to god amen the saints of god were
[1:36:36] praying and god did a mighty work
[1:36:38] god come down and visited that brother
[1:36:40] in the hospital and angels showed up
[1:36:42] because angels are still here and
[1:36:43] they're still watching over us
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:47] and the angel said you're gonna be okay
[1:36:50] so i tell the church don't fear kovid
[1:36:52] don't fear cancer don't fear anything
[1:36:55] because greater is he that's in you than
[1:36:56] he that's in the world greater is the
[1:36:58] god of our prophet the god of our life
[1:37:01] to our god our husband our bridegroom
[1:37:03] greater is he than anything the devil
[1:37:06] can conjure up

[1:39:04] it's not how holy you are
[1:39:08] as can you believe
[1:39:13] daniel
[1:39:14] was seeking god and the angel gabriel
[1:39:16] came to him to give him instruction
[1:39:19] daniel was thrown in the lion's den
[1:39:21] the angel of god showed up and stopped
[1:39:23] the mouths of the lions
[1:39:27] yes he did
[1:39:29] daniel excuse me they said to me second
[1:39:31] a bit ago
[1:39:32] they weren't going to bow
[1:39:34] because the brother was saying to their
[1:39:36] statue of their brother
[1:39:38] of their prophet daniel
[1:39:40] they weren't going to bow
[1:39:42] do you imagine how that must have felt
[1:39:43] when all of a sudden
[1:39:45] everybody bowed
[1:39:46] cornet flew everything
[1:39:49] every israelite there bowed
[1:39:51] except shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:39:53] yeah in the province they were in
[1:39:55] they stood there
[1:39:57] and they're looking around
[1:39:59] nobody
[1:40:01] is about everybody's bowed but us
[1:40:05] right
[1:40:06] well that's okay i'd rather die

[1:40:12] i'd rather die in the furnace than
[1:40:13] worship my prophet
[1:40:15] i'd rather die in the furnace
[1:40:17] i'd rather die in the furnace
[1:40:19] believing god can help me than just
[1:40:22] surrendering to the enemy
[1:40:24] huh
[1:40:25] boldly walking there
[1:40:27] and they get thrown in the furnace it
[1:40:29] wasn't the end of the story
[1:40:30] now if god was done with him and god
[1:40:32] wanted to take him home had been the end
[1:40:33] of the story but guess what they would
[1:40:34] have been in glory have you ever heard
[1:40:36] the story of going beyond the curtain of
[1:40:38] time
[1:40:39] oh it'll be so sublime you don't want to
[1:40:41] miss it
[1:40:42] why are we fearing death
[1:40:43] we shouldn't even fear it
[1:40:45] it's almost like we should be saying
[1:40:46] yeah hey throw me in the fire that
[1:40:48] sounds really good
[1:40:50] huh
[1:40:51] but if god want to deliver me god will
[1:40:53] deliver us

[1:41:02] worrying about the promotion you're
[1:41:03] worrying about the boss don't worry
[1:41:04] about it
[1:41:05] if god wants to close the door sometimes
[1:41:07] we're treated unfair at work sometimes
[1:41:09] the devil knows how to try to get to us
[1:41:10] amen we have situations and problems and
[1:41:13] it's always just the devil but sometimes
[1:41:15] god allows those things amen
[1:41:18] but we shouldn't fear him
[1:41:21] are you hearing me yeah but rather we
[1:41:23] should realize i'm a child of god yes
[1:41:25] sir i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of
[1:41:27] god amen amen
[1:41:29] no weapon formed against me is going to

[1:41:39] that settled you walk with the lord
[1:41:41] praise the lord and there are angels and
[1:41:43] then we come to church

[1:41:46] could be well one of the greatest places
[1:41:49] is to come to church
[1:41:50] what an opportunity

[1:41:54] many things to do

[1:41:56] opportunity to come into the house of
[1:41:58] god to hear the preaching of the word
[1:42:01] like you've never heard before
[1:42:04] this message is
[1:42:05] a portion of the word that that that all

[1:47:02] your servant elijah with the message of

[1:47:14] you opened my eyes
[1:47:16] in my heart
[1:47:17] to be able to believe it to receive it
[1:47:21] and though many might walk away and many
