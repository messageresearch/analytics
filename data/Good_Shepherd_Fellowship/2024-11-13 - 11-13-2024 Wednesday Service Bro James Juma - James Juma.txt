day to be living in this hour where God is able to do all those things uh much more than he has ever done it before and we realize with this is the last day um this is the day where everything is being done in its fullness and and so we have the extra benefit getting more than what the others did amen so in the scripture will tell us as long as we believe it we can have it our faith is the currency for for this Kingdom and so we certainly appreciate the Lord for his goodness I want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ tonight and I want to believe that somebody here was praying for me to come back because I wasn't supposed to come back but you know God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform so I want us to believe that there's a reason why we're here there's a reason why I had also to be here tonight and uh I believe um God knows the timetable God knows where we are and he certainly knows what we need for this time uh and and what our faith needs at this time too so we want to believe tonight that God will help us and um I might have prepared something to say but you know what how God works he works with your faith uh he's able to direct the service tonight he's able to make me go this way or leave my notes and leave everything else so I I I I'm I'm always sensitive to that I I I most time I just leave the notes and say Lord you know exactly what I need so and what your people need and so give us that today so I I so learn as I go along I'm preaching to myself to when I preach because that's how God works because this is not a lecture has we it has be done it's preaching which must be done by inspiration so we certainly thank you for your prayers thank you Pastor for his kindness again to have us here tonight so without taking much time we' like to turn to couple of scriptures in the Bible and and see what God would have us to to share around I will ask you to do is you have a silent prayer for me there and U and we we'll surely have a good time in the Lord tonight amen I'm un expectation for him to speak amen and and and when he does anything the scripture says he he does it he does a good job he always never disappoints amen hallelujah so let's read um Matthew 10 Matthew 10 we're going to read verse four from verse 40 I think Matthew 10 so I I believe you've come uh with a big appetite he can only give you as you expect that's that's the laws of God he if you if you ask much he'll give you much if you come believing he'll reward you all right so let's let's let's read from verse 40 uh Matthew 10 from 40 to 42 and I'll ask you to read with me as well like we did last time he he that receiveth you receiveth me let's read together and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me 41 he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive 42 who shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward amen so we have a promise there verse 41 he that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet reward amen and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous men shall receive a righteous man's reward amen may the Lord he the blessing to the reading of the word soorry bow head for prayer our gracious and kind Heavenly Father we want to thank you and and certainly appreciate your goodness and mercy to us bringing us together again on a night like tonight

worthy portion oh God food for this hour Lord Jesus Jus you you know our stations in life you know our positions our conditions our our our prayers Lord and what you're longing for and what you're thirsting for Lord Jesus and you the scripture says you're able to give us much more than we can ever think or ask so we are asking tonight that you'd come and fill our cups Lord may they overflow tonight may we go home saying it was good to have been in your house may we meet with us in a special way tonight the different needs in the assembly father some are not here some are sick wherever they could be we pray that your healing hand would touch them tonight you a God who does things you you are within touching distance you you're within healing distance father you're able to give peace you're able to give joy you even if we don't have it in this Dimension you're able to create it for us father that's why we are so thankful to to know the time we are living in where father squ were created things that were not in this Dimension were brought in this Dimension and somebody could cook those things and eat them and take them out of this Dimension again what a time what a place father you you could deal with sister he and the children Lord out of nothing you could create something and those boys who were not even wanting to be Christians father you you you you gave them

Heart oh God from person to person tonight and may we say that it God passed their away tonight at the end of this service may you grant all these things and may all glory and honor be given your most worthy and wonderful name we ask it all believing in Jesus wonderful name and all the saints saying amen thank you God bless you we take your seats I have a quotation I would like to read as we start um it's in C O D um 64 823e questions and answers uh question 321 is based on the scriptures we read it says brother I if if you have time please explain Matthew 10:41 if you have time please explain Matthew 10:41 I'd like to know what the prophec reward is what is the prophet reward maybe we spoke a bit about that last time I'm not sure but I like to just focus in on this today says well now Jesus said whosoever receive a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet reward a prophet reward is to be a friend with the prophet you get that Saint so a prophet's reward is to be a friend with a prophet that's our subject tonight A friend of the Prophet or friendship with the prophet okay it says who soever receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man receives a righteous man reward is that right and if they want to know what a prophet's reward is is to be a friend to the prophet see that's a reward he's your friend he's your friend now 221 he says like the shunamite woman like the shunamite woman it might come in handy sometime see it did with her I want us to catch that like the shunamite woman it might come in handy sometime see it did with her it came in handy with her amen amen so that's what we want to see tonight watch God servants so he has told us that the the reward of a prophet is to be a friend of with the prophet a prophet's reward is to be a friend with the prophet amen so that's why brother V would come and say good evening friends good morning friends all right let's go to Second Timothy second Kings sorry Second Kings uh we are reading from chapter 4 2 Kings chapter 4 we want to see the shunamite woman we want to see what is says it might come in handy sometime because it did for her you see that Saints so he's pointed us to where this applies and he says you if you look at that you might also get the same blessing like she got amen amen so we look at this woman in 2 Kings uh chapter 4 she's a friend of Elijah all right so the same background with us we have a prophet in this age and that Prophet is none other but Elijah right all right so let's look at this okay just before we go there just maybe part one from chapter 4 verse one it says now they cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha so still the same thing right yeah saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that the thy servant did fear the lord and the cre has come to take unto him my two sons to be born men and Elisha said unto you what shall I do for thee tell me what is thou in the house now before she could answer Elisha had already suggested the answer now you stay with me we're going to be in the scripture here he says she comes to him she says please I have an issue here my husband who happened to be your servant is dead now the Creditor has come to take the children so she had problems and issues like all of us right but she knew where to take them too that's that's the difference now that's very important you can make the whole world try and and and and look at you and pity you and everything else but that won't solve your problem you have to know you must have the key to the door amen yes so we being told how it was here Sheed the problem and children were going to be taken and then she remembered and she knew that only person who could help me here is the prophet for this hour and so she goes to him and she tells him the story says my your servant my husband is dead like I always say she knew how what to put first she didn't put husband first she put your servant so she must establish the relationship between her husband and elij then she can write on that when that is established she can now write on that and present her case based on that relationship I hope you see what what we're talking about she doesn't project herself first she he doesn't know me but the one he knows is my husband amen and so if I'm going to talk to him I have to project my husband first so that that relationship is cemented and then I when he agrees or he accept that relationship then I can come and say I was married to him yeah and then I have this children with him so she knew the the approach prop says you have to know how to approach him like that woman was saying thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus never turned she cried and cried and Jesus never turned until the disciples came in and said Lord answer her for she cries after us and that's when he turned not to her but to them the disciples and says I was not not sent but to the L House of Israel I cannot give children's bread to dogs and she Le LED on to that now that instead of discouraging it she held on to that and she said yeah Lord even dogs e the Crums that fall from the master table then he turned and he saids I've never seen such Faith look at that from the negative to the positive here she she could have said I don't want look I'm not coming to that church again she could have said you called me a dog people your disciples help you you called me a dog amen I I I thought you're god of love I thought she didn't say that she knew what she had come for and she was not going to pick a pick a complex because of that of the answer she was looking for any any sign oh my you have to understand when you deal with God that he he he's Supernatural and he doesn't work with one plus one is too many times you have to be sensitive to the moving of the spirit he can ask you to do some things now that he didn't ask you to the Bible says he wants you to believe not to understand and many times in trying to understand you lose what he's trying to give you so if you know he has designed this whole world is design time in season he knows everything that's happening here he knows or who is going to be president and what's are going to happen and everything else he knows all about it and how things are going to be difficult or better he knows all about it and guess what all that his plans he's planned around that for you you are the first person he thinks about you know God doesn't go to work you know that it doesn't go for shift right come on he doesn't have other projects you are his project you are the project 247 he he's he's he's watching you he doesn't forget about you and then remembers you when you call him no remember Prophet tells us when M bad Neo when they were in trouble in Babylon and the angel said to Lord you know there's been trouble have you been watching the news you know from last night you know the people are going to be thrown in the fire and God says I've been watching them all the time amen H cuz what what else does he have to do but but but be on your case right that's right there's nothing he finished creation long ago yes and he and and he he rested right and now he's watching The Creation operates fulfilling his word that's all he does he says I the Lord have planted I will water it day and night L somebody plug them out Hallelujah so you you you are his case study you are his project he's watching you he's looking at you and he knows exactly what you need he knows exactly what faith you must you have in your faith account and he knows that with this little faith she's got this trial coming next week so we have to work on their faith increase it so that she can overcome that because he wants you to be overcome God doesn't Delight in you being overcome he wants you to be an overcome he wants you to provide your need for you a father for your family because he says I'm a father and I provide for my own amen says call upon me and I will supply seek and you find knock and I'll open the door amen there there's no negotiations once you you you you knock he opens yes because he he he want he wants to show you what fatherhood is he says which of you if you're a father when when your children ask you for bread you give them a stone say don't do that when they ask you for fish you give them a serpent says that's not fatherhood he says when they ask you you must give them now that's what father wood is all about oh my let's see how far we can go with this so she says to Elisha this is what is happened and then the creditors have come to take my two sons to be born men verse two and Elisha said said unto her what shall I do for thee I like that now look at that prayer and look at how God answers it she's prayed you know if you're are seeking something the Bible says in King James language the terms I pray thee do this for me so she's she's praying that something be done for her and then the answer she gets is what do you want me to do for you oh he's not quizzing you on anything else he's not debating you with anything else the answer she gets because of your approach he can only answer this way what do you want me to do for you now that's a blank check you write your check what do you want me to do for you oh my and then before she answers he goes ahead tell me what has thou in the house no he he gone over overdrive what do you want me to do for you before she's still thinking what do I what do I ask him for money do I asking for this no before he she even asks he goes ahead solution what do you have in your house and she said thine handmade look at that she she's still as as respectful as ever has nothing no nothing in the house nothing in in the house that's how broke she was nothing in the house except a pot of oil that's all I have nothing else in the house then he said go that's a command right borrow the vessels abroad of how many all thy neighbors we're dealing with Elijah here Elijah is in the land and his message is in the land and so she's a believer of Elijah's message she knows where to go to when there's problems and she has gone to the right place and look at the answer that she's getting God borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels oh my and borrow not a few oh my borrow from all your neighbors and borrow not a few that's right not that's God for you am that's when you thought God doesn't care about you when you thought maybe he won't answer me and he's telling you this is what I what I've thought about you and this is how much I have reserved for you go and borrow from all your neighbors go borrow empty vessels from all your neighbors how did you know how many neighbors she had all your neighbors this is God telling you he's able to give you much more than you can ever think or ask ask much is does it say ask much yeah and we are afraid to ask yeah we at times we ask in installments you know people some people repent in installments you know you you know Pastor I yeah you know what I did and then it's it's it's it's only a quarter of what he did then after another Revival comes he comes you know Pastor that case I told you about what really happened there I think I never told you everything there was this other part I left out okay that's fine you think it's finished they come again that wheelbarrow that I said I took without uh permission actually there were some stuff inside which I sold I mean take 10 years to repent of one thing but now the problem is you see God says as long as you've got issues there I cannot bless you God cannot bless over sin you are limiting yourself take neon for instance he had leprosy how many remember that and the answer was go and deep yourself there how many times seven times in the river joh so it was up to him to decide if he was going to do it in style dip himself once a week right if he wanted to go like this that's up to him he's only he's only delaying he's healing yeah amen amen so if he wants to do it once a month it will take him seven months isn't that so so you want to you want to be a farmer and you want to S once once a year you only reap also once a year is that isn't that right you you you you you pay your tithes once a once a month or once a year or once in two years you're only delaying your blessing isn't it because was that is a blessing with it he says I challenge you if you does Malachi right so the answer is in your hand but let's look at this this is God's intention God is telling you his attitude towards you with for anything you ask of him he's much more able to give you than you think he will give you that's right oh my I like this special cases it's a widow so she's like a weaker vers she's even in in the weaker state but God is saying if I can do that for her what about you amen all right then she she and borrow not a few and then when thou art come in thou sht shut the door upon thee and upon thy signs and shall pour out into all those vessels not some huh and thou shall set aside that which is full now here is God dealing with his subject she has asked for something and God is giving it the answer here but look at the answer it requires Faith too now he says go borrow empty vessels borrow not a few borrow from all your neighbors now it gives you homework maybe he didn't really understand when I said I have a little oil because how do if he understood how can he propose that I go and borrow empty vessels and borrow not a few maybe say you didn't really understand how much I have so he understood I know you I know how much you have I know how much you have but I'm I'm telling you what I'm able to do with what you [Music] have just surrender to me it's like the story of the five BNS and the two fish among so many says just give it to me so that's God for you he doesn't want much from you all he wants is that little faith the size of a house no the mastered seeds he says if you have that faith that's that's enough we can work with that what do you have in your house a little oil says that's good we can work with that that's right that little faith that you have you can he can work with that oh my that's all he wants from you just that little faith giving over to him watch what he does with it when you come to church on a cold day and a cold night and you could have done this and this showing God your faith I could have been doing this but Lord I know that if I do that that would be the end of it but I I want to put you first in my life the greatest investment I can ever make is to make it in the word in the in his kingdom there's nothing that you can do for him without him paying you back and when he pays you back you can be assured is Multiplied oh my that's one good thing about him and with him there's no inflation there's no bank failures there's nothing else when God says he's going to do it you can rest assured he's going to do it Hallelujah remember the story the way where that that man says well there's drought but then this this prophet prophesied and said there's going to be food tomorrow that's elishah again yeah and that man say my friend you're wasting your time even if there was Heaven to open there will be no food enough in Samaria and Elish said you will see it tomorrow but you won't partake of it that's right and it happened to F how did God do it through the two lepers from The Impossibles yes least expected yes people that thought they were dying but then they took a decision if we go there they'll kill us if we remain here we die we rather go there maybe and it worked amen and there was food in Samaria the next day and when that guy also saw it he was told to do something and then the people crushed him and he died according to the word of the Lord yeah when God promises you you can be rest assured he's going to do it okay quickly now he says she went look at him she she's a she's a a faithful sister verse five so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon his sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out there's all these vessels now she's borrowed not a few and borrowed from all the neighbors and now she takes that little oil and it's an Act of Faith I mean how can you look at all these 200 lit drums here and then you've got only a small pot of oil and you must feel over these vessels with oil from here and Elisha is not there no one is there you and your children and The Devil Is Right There by you telling your woman sister I think you misunderstood it's good to be religious but don't be a fanatic that's what the devil tell you it's good to be a Christian but you're bordering on the fanatical side I mean this is not rational and the devil starts playing with your your mind and so but she says no I believe I believe I know what Elijah is able to do and believing it is the prophet says is the substance that creates a perfect faith and so she starts pouring oh my she starts pouring in and let's say she pours the first five or something then halfway through when she goes to the others you know she she starts pouring and then the next thing the start stuttering oh now here's the devil now telling me it's finished it wouldn't last I knew it wouldn't last but here's you if you're a Believer now if God made me fill up five from nothing why should I doubt the rest of it amen and why should I even look inside the small tiot to see if they steal anything because look there five you filled we're not coming from here man yeah there was not enough to fill these ones so why should you look to this one again are are you are you doubting did you say five did you say how many scos you remember brother Bram and he said I want so many and then after found I think three or so then he one says I can go home says you've already spoken it amen are you now doubting now what it simply means is when you start walking with God when you start doing the Act of Faith don't stop amen keep on doing it he will fulfill his word he'll never stop you'll never stop once God starts doing something you can be assured he's going to do it up to the End Amen so here we are in this day age and God has promised us that he's never going to leave us nor forsake us we are likely go through some some difficult patches some some challenges but he must he wants you to apply Faith amen amen faith will win the day for you faith will overcome every time okay we we we we we pass it came to pass when the verse verse six we're full m they were full then she said to her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and then what happened and the oil stayed did you hear that the only time the oil stopped when was when there were no more vessels yes which means as long as there were vessels empty vessels that oil was still going to come out oh my my my you see this the potential of this moment when as long as you are needy as long as you are believing God is able to fulfill what he says am God is able to bless you above what you think or what what you can imagine you are the only limiting factor the only limiting factor here was lack of vessels which means as long as there were vessels God was going to fill them right as long as you are Desiring those things God will always give you right the sin of the children of Israel was the Bible says they limited the Holy One of Israel in the wilderness they say can God fish a table in the wilderness okay he took us from Pharaoh okay he gave us money he gave us this but can he do the rest if he did the first he can do the second too amen amen hallelujah if he did this for this sister he can do this for this brother too amen wonderful look then we let's read here uh verse verse um verse 7 then she came and told the man of God and he said what go sell the oil and pay thy debt uhhuh that's what she was worried about right she she had a debt to pay and that's why the creditors it come to take the children so here the prescription is everything has been done so go sell the oil and pay thy debt but God doesn't stop there he goes further and leave thou and thy children from of the rest of it so he knows exactly what you need he knows if you only solve the debt you still have these other issues so he goes ahead and and prescribes for that too oh my amen so when he does that he says you and your children go and leave of the rest of it did he say that you know what that means now so he's already affected in whatever they're going to need through life Journey the school fees for the children the uniforms the Medical Aid you name it whatever is going to be required after this God has already FedEd it in oh my oh my oh my did you did you hear that do you understand what you're saying about Saints these are not stories here this is God showing you amen his relationship with you if he did it for that sister is's able to do it for you too what did Auntie jera do in this day did she not go to God with this scripture and say Lord I read in the Bible about Auntie Jima we have the same type of conditions and cases and now when she prayed you answered what about me amen so when you read this you must have that in mind now God is showing you you can depend on this you can rely on this when you are caught up in a situation and nothing is working you can come back to the Bible here and that God who keeps his word will never fail to keep his word no matter what the economy turns out to be we have Elijah here we have the same God of Elijah he's able to do what he did much more for you in this last day oh somebody say Amen Hallelujah okay we we we finish that we come to verse eight and then we now with sister remember like the shunamite woman you remember remember we read brother c d he said like the shunamite woman it came in handy for her and it will do for you and now we want the shunamite woman look at this man from verse eight it fell on a day that Elisha passed to shim where there was a great woman she was it says a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread okay she constrained him you know constrain is not asking it's much more than asking she she so she must have seen that he is different this is the man of God here and something came on and inspired her to say look can't you just pass through here and and have some water or or tea or whatever and and and and and eat a muscle of bread every time you pass would like to you to pass through here won't detain you you just come in have something to eat and something to drink and you go and she constrained him it means he was he refused but she constrained him know that's what faith really does when you recognize he says brother says when when a child of God sees where the spirit is they will identify it they know where spirit is he says hallelujah so here she she see this is a man of God here remember I talking about being a friend of the prophet and now so she she's not going to let this pass by she's not going to let this opportunity pass by okay then what happens she constrained him and to eat bread and so it was that as often as he passed by as often as he passed by whether they pass twice a week three times a week whatever as often as he passed by he turned in there to eat bread and so that went on for a while look at verse 9 now and then the other day she said unto her husband behold beh now I perceive not I see I perceive now perception is is that takes Faith that's takes Revelation now that woman in the world remember what she said again sir I perceive that you are a a prophet the woman in the world John 4:24 now this is the same thing now she recognizes that this is okay she said I perceive that this is an holy man of God which passed by us how how often continually so it means she was watching him she was observing him now don't miss me don't miss it here that's why it gets real real real interesting here she was observing this prophet and she saw him she saw his conduct she saw it and spirit around him and she thought she knew that this is not an ordinary man okay she had the offer of coming him coming to eat bread and and having a cool drink whatever or tea whatever but now she because of what she has seen she UPS a offer she UPS her worship you go when you see down there she was ask what do you want a reward for this no that's that's that's my my offer That's My Worship I don't do this because I want money or anything else now so she was worshiping God by doing that and now when she sees more of him and Sees God in this man something happens and she UPS or escalates or goes higher in your in your faith in your offering in your worship amen and she says to your husband behold now I perceive that this is an holy man of God which passes by us continually I see him come I see him go I see him come I see him go and I see he has no ambition whatsoever for anything else but just the word and therefore I asked that let us make a little chamber I pray the on the wall and let us set for him there what a bed a table a stool and what a candle stick now there there it is he's got a bed there he's got a desk there he's got a chair and he's got a Candlestick so he can come study and then sleep and then the morning you can go and so she gets this as a as a revelation now from just giving me a drink and and something to it she God inspires her to come up higher here now look at what happens verse 11 so the husband agreed and they do they made the thing from verse 10 to verse 11 everything was done it fell on a day that he came there and he turned into the chamber so this sister and the husband have constructed the the the the little room put in the bed put in the desk put in the the chair and put in the reading light all right everything set right all right then what happens now he he this day that he comes the first time he comes obviously they introduce him to this this rud room and Men of God we have decided this is going to be our offering this our worship to God don't pay for it nothing we just felt that we could do this for you because we've watched you come up and down we have seen your labors we have seen your conduct we have we have we we we we know you the the atmosphere around you and we we decided we we haven't seen this and and we we we want to increase our our our our sacrifice and they did it and they said well this is the room there's the bed here so they show him obviously with gazi and then sister goes and then he is left Al Al with gazi verse 11 and fell on the day that he came there he turned into the chamber and lay there so he lays on the bed now brother brah says I want you to see what happened when Elisha lay on that bed the first time the first day he goes in there and he sees what was a revelation to this to this sister and this family here and he goes into that Revelation here and he's in there and then he lays on that bed something happens he can't sleep he cannot sleep verse 12 and he said to gazi his servant call this shunamite now wait a minute this shunamite is just showing you the room this shunamite is just explained to you how they came to be giving the room because on the on the bread she constrained and now here she has to constrain him again look you you can now stay you you see we you don't have to tie yourself now she has given them the room she has show them everything and she's gone and before she she sleeps that night G has Co it before they sleep there for the First Night gazi Calls says what he says go call her call This shunamite And when he had called her she stood before him is that what you read amen uhhuh are we are we together watch this now watch this I'm going to demonstrate this one don't miss this sisters don't miss this when she calls him he says what she stood where before before him so she's standing here is that so yeah so she's expecting Elisha to address it right yes because she called for him is that so understand this so far but but but what does Elisha do let's read that together verse 12 let's read that together oh okay verse 13 let's read that together and the 13 133 sorry and he said unto him unto who sorry him okay him this is Elisha speaking to his servant and he said and he said unto him okay let's read say now unto her what behold thou has been careful for us with how much care all this now what what is to be done for thee that's another blank check again before she even answers he goes ahead would you be spoken for to who the king the king the highest office in the land or to the what cap of the host and she answered what's your answer among my own people I don't need that I don't have any need I don't need anything I I'm satisfied everything is perfect with me I don't need anybody's intervention I don't need any extra attention I don't need any blessing I have everything now what happened now but before you go there there's something strange there he calls he calls for her she comes and she stands before him so he's supposed to address her directly is that so yeah but he doesn't instead how does he do he addresses Gaz and he says you ask her so what's happening here you sent me to call her I did and now she's standing before you you speak to her but no you now speak via G has and say ask her what she wants you see this is just showing you what how God views this when you give yourself over to doing what God said you must do and when that pleases God you know who comes God himself remember Moses what did God say to Moses you become God Amen and your brother becomes your prophet and this is what's happening here now Elisha becomes God hallelujah gazi becomes the prophet and he says you ask her what she wants oh my God saying to brother Bram ask her she wants so all of a sudden things change here it looks like an ordinary case it look like an ordinary situation but no it's not God has been so pleased with what has happened he now steps on the scene and now he identifies himself and he says because of what you have done ask what you will amen thank you Lord would you be spoken for to the king the highest office in the land says no I don't need anything that goes I dwell among my own people would you want us to speak to the Army General says no I don't need anything from there now look at what happens now look at vers at verse the next verse verse 14 I want us to follow this now verse 14 okay before we go there he says behold you have been careful for us with how much care all this care now this is God for you he doesn't forget what you do for him no matter how small he puts it all together all this care not half care all this so he knows about the the the bread that he they were giving him the the the tree that he was being given and now he sees this and he puts it all together I know all this I have seen you you're doing this for me and then what does he say Okay vers verse verse 14 sir sorry 14 and he said this is this is a Elisha now look at the statement what then is to be done for her now analyze that statement she said she turned down everything I don't need any help I don't need any blessing I don't need any money I don't I dwell among my own people I did this because it's my Revelation I didn't do this for money for anything else for recognition no sir This Is My Worship and so Elijah Elijah could not sleep he had to workit go college and she came and now she says I can't do anything else and then still he say he's no in a qu he's perplexed he says what then must be done for her what then shows you somebody's is desperate here something has to be done for her the thing is you cannot do something for God or his children and him not reward you no he it doesn't work it doesn't work like that there's no way you can bless his people and God sits still no matter how small did he say even a glass of water yeah that's right hello hello did he say even a glass of water amen and he watches what you do the sacrif ice you make and now look at this in the Days of Elijah oh my what then is to be done for her desperation ever thought of that well think after this you must think about that whatever you do when you've done something good God pursues you overtakes you because God does not owe any man anything he refuses to or anyone hallelujah oh my oh my oh my oh my and then what what gazi God anoints him and he and gazi answered verily she has no child and her husband is old there it is now she's a a case here an impossible case she has no child and even she wanted to have a child her husband is impossible now money could not solve that doctors could not solve that she was a rich woman no doubt she could have gone to any Hospital any specialist but they can't solve a case another case of Abraham and Sarah yeah that's right but when when Elijah elishah hears that look at what he says verse 15 and verse 15 let's go and what did he say and he said what again the third time that night we not sleeping here until something is done for her amen call her and when he had called it she stood in the door what now what's this and look at what happens now when he stands in the door let's go then next verse and he said about this season according to the time of life Thou shalt Embrace a son and she said nay my Lord thou men of God do not lie unto thine handmade now look at this he never asked the sister if she wanted his son he never asked her to have faith we're going to pray for you now I see I think we've identified your problem you you don't you don't have a child your husband is old now you you you must believe and we will pray for you you must raise your faith to a point where that thing will happen to no that is not the case yet because of what she had done God bypassed her faith what is happening now he has not nothing to do with her faith he's not waiting yet to call A Gifted brother to come and pray with her or pray for her or say sister now we we have to have a week of consecration you know this thing that you really need now this thing takes more faith I see your faith is a bit low let's raise it but she's past that place it's just right to th say the Lord am amen this time next year the next season you have a son not a daughter a son oh my and Elisha can go to sleep now the pressure is off right that's right oh my look at what happened she she's she's been given a son things that money cannot buy nothing else could help her in this regard God was able to look at a real need and Supply it despite her doubt she said no man of God don't lie to me she's not even believing it she thinks this man this man and his friend they they are so you know they so over overwhelmed by what I did for them they have to try and please me somehow you know can I prophesy you pass through a certain place and the sister gives you a little token and the men all of say can I prophesy some Moos you know how these people are this is when they see there's a benefit there they say there's a prophecy for you there's one brother they phoned a brother from De here somewhere and then he's in up in Know Country there so he PHS one brother and he says brother where are you he says I'm here by this hotel he says where there I've got a prophecy for you so he drives to that place where the brother is and then he says you how much do you have says do you have 250 250 years says no I don't says well they they they they they begins to go down says I've got to give you the prophecy so if you have $250 I give you says we went down to 50 says I so I still I don't have it says I no then in that case you own have it won't give you the prophecy prophecy for sale now if you don't know if you don't know the word you fall for anything yes yes sir because he had prophesied before and some of those things had happened now simply because somebody prophesies and the things happen does not translate into therefore everything he says will come to pass say he says you have to watch every prophecy if they prophesy today something happens we thank God for it if they come tomorrow again the same people the same Prophet we're not going to say because of that yesterday this one is correct no everything is fresh everything must be Tried by the word yeah then you believer them now look at this then what happened the woman conceived bear a son at that season that elishah had said unto her according to the time of life so she lived to see a time where she possessed what she could not possess under the message of Elijah just by being a prophet friend somebody who was friendly to the Prophet Elijah scripture says he that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophecy what and what's the rich word a friend of the prophet he says it might come in handy someday it did for the shite woman and look at what happening in this what we're reading did it help her here yes yes amen and this child he says was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the Rippers and he said unto his father my head my head and he said said to your lord car him to his mother and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on the knees till noon and then died the blessing died the prophet tolds us he was about 11 12 years old now so she had lived for 12 years with that blessing and then the blessing died and did she say well I'm not the first one so and so son died other one died at least I others who never had children I had one no she didn't say that no she said take me to that man hallelujah amen take me to that man who you going to I'm going to Elisha what's the story no don't worry all is well I'm coming back Hallelujah all is well I'm coming back thank you Lord she writes and she says you guys go ahead don't slacken your riding don't slacken this is an emergency when you went to the husband to ask for the horse for the said but what why he said I want to go to the men of God he says why today is not a new moon is not a service today why says don't worry everything is under control I'm going there and I'm coming back and then she said to the to the to the young man he says you right go forward slack not thy riding for me except I beat thee verse 25 so she she went and came unto the men of God to mount camel and it came to pass when the man of God saw a far off he said to Gaz Serv behold Yonder is the shunamite run now I pray thee to meet her I like this look at that relationship don't wait for you to come run now to meet him and say unto her let's read together is it well with thee is it well with thy husband yeah is it well with the child and she answered it is well is hallelujah hallelujah oh my it is well it is well with the child dead in the house it is well oh my look now she she's she's got this I never asked for this child I never asked for anything special it's you who proposed this and now the child is dead I'm not taking I'm not taking it I never I'm not taking it so she she says it is well and when she came to the man of God to the hill she caught him by the feet but Gaz came near to thrust her away and the man of God said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the Lord has hid it from me and has not told me God doesn't tell His prophets everything yeah that's right you know where brother T it now yeah some things he doesn't tell them that's why when that woman died and brother says God you owe me an explanation says me owe you an explanation he says and when you do that God will let you cook in your own stew he won't even speak to you says he never spoke to me for a long time then another time sometime later he says he said to me come here you wanted you were asking me about that woman that died because brother said this family said if this woman is healed she had miscarriage and stuff like that the doctor was going to operate she was going to go home and then but she kept on saying I'm going home I'm going home the mother was saying but yeah we'll go home tomorrow after the doctor has operated says no I'm going home and that evening she died and brother is saying but God this family was saying if this woman gets healed they will come to you to the Lord and now you have taken it Lord you owe me an explanation and God says me owe you an explanation me so he let him like that after some years or months or whatever then he says you come here you were asking me about that woman go and ask her mom was there not a time when they were out there in a picnic somewhere and then she nearly drowned when she was young and somebody caught her says that was their time to go but I then kept her so that she could come to the Lord and then she can go and now when I've kept her and brought her to the Lord now you asking me why so God doesn't tell His prophets everything are we are we are we are we happy with that all right so let's go we we nearly done we nearly done and and look at this now verse 28 then she said did I desire a son of my Lord did I not say Do not deceive sister wait wait wait did I deceive you say yeah what did you do what did you do oh my she set the standard High she lifted the power up high did I ask for this child no I never asked you you tried to say when you can we take you to the king to the I said I don't need any help I'm fine and it's you who told me that prophecy and I told you don't lie to me and now here you give me something for 11 years and then you take it away no sir I'm not taking it I'm not taking it but this is all God showing you when you become a friend of that Prophet that is not temporary oh it's not temporary oh my look at this and then he said to Gaz get get thy loins and th stuff okay we go forward she she eventually the child was resurrected right uh she had put him on the bed as well she had put him on that bed Elisha's bed that's where she had put the dead baby and then she Elisha found it there then that's where he prayed for the child now look at this the Bible okay there's lots of other things here we could talk about then this child came back to life all right I want us to jum that then chap come to chapter 8 brother if you can quickly come to chapter 8 um all right chapter 8 we we look at this woman same woman again from verse one then spake Elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou in thine household and sojin wheresoever thou can serjin for the Lord has called for amen and it shall also come upon the land seven years all right and the woman arose and did after the saying of the men of God and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines how many years seven years yes sir and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth C to cry unto the king for what her house and for her land and the King talked to the G house at same time God arranges in such a way that the king is talking to gazi asking him saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that elishah has done and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for a house and for your land and gazi said my Lord oh King this is the woman and this is her son whom elishah restored to life oh my look at how God set it up hallelujah look at how God set it up and if he did that for her he would do that for you too amen she she she instead of having an appointment and come next week come next month God made it so seamless God prepared everything for her oh my what a mighty God we serve because she obeyed the voice of Elijah she went there seven years and then she came back here and she did not doubt the word of Elijah yes she was a friend to the prophets amen you hear that Saints she believed him to be a prophet and she received him as a prophet oh my now is this is talking about you and me yeah we have Elijah here in this last day and the Fulfillment of all the oh there's never been a day like this day to us amen that's right and this Prophet happens to be the most Vindicated One Church book says there's no one as thoroughly Vindicated as this messenger all the way from Enoch Enoch is Genesis up to today there's no one is Thoroughly Vindicated as the prophet of this age you know that one isn't I could read it for you it's in church book because this is the final age God is doing everything according to the to to the age there is no one is Thoroughly Vindicated like brother brandham and why is God doing that because he wants you to have an unadulterated Faith he wants you to believe that you are God's he says you're the cream of the crop that's right oh my the apple of his eye remember God designed you for this last age don't forget that God designed you for this last age um Let me let me just get that just a few maybe somebody doesn't doesn't um doesn't know this that quotation okay that Vindicated than was any other Prophet from the time of Enoch now God is doing all this so that you can know who you are what you believed okay all right here he says in the L distant Church age he says um when we okay there's a lot to go with this he say who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bright that means we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul amen I'll tell you who will have it it will be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day oh did somebody hear that yes from all the way from Enoch to this day there's no Prophet as stly Vindicated as the prophet of this age now you can understand what word you have what message you have yes we have a message brother and sister that's right what a message we have oh my now you're going to be a friend of that Prophet who was more thoroughly Vindicated than any other Prophet amen oh my so why should you doubt what he told you this woman did not doubt this woman believed and she went for seven years and after seven years she came back and she after she came back she didn't cry for Elijah she went to the king says my land is taken my house is taken but God had prepared for it amen is a god of preparation God had prepared the fish for Jonah God prepares things he says that God prepare a place for you before you step into tomorrow tomorrow is a prepared day for you before you step into the weekend it's already prepared your winter is prepared he knows what you're going to meet in there he's already prepared for you yes if there's a 26 26 he's already prepared too Hallelujah now she she then the king said when the king asked for the asked the woman she told him now looks in the next statement so the king that that scripture appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was his how much just how much all that was his and all the fruits of the land even until now wow it says the fruit of the of of the fruits of the field right since when the day sh that he left the land up to now that must be restored after 7 years absence God still wants had to get the everything that was hers restore unto her

when you are sick you'll never give up on you amen amen look he never gave up on him because he was dead he says I'm going to go after him after four days the the the the nose that fallen in the eyes everything else he was now beginning they say don't open the door what did they say he stinet he says whether he stinks or not he's my friend and I'm going after him oh my you you you never seen to a point where he doesn't come after you you don't stink enough he'll come after you he he he he overlooks all everything else just to get you that's how much he loves you hallelujah oh my Abraham also

friendship with him like he said to that woman go sell what you have pay the debt then the rest the balance live off of it you and your children so he's factored in inflation he's factored in interest
