[10:19] God's an object of worship.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; What did you say? His name shall be
[10:25] called
[10:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; What was his name? Emmanuel is an
[10:31] interpretation of God with us. You see,
[10:33] that just means God with us. See, I
[10:35] don't mean to say there could be any
[10:37] kind of God with us. See, but this
[10:38] interpret what is the name of this God
[10:40] with us?
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; His name shall be called Jesus.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; Then when Peter said when Matthew said
[10:49] baptize them in the Now what who is Mary
[10:51] and John that live happily ever after.
[10:54] See you see what it is when Peter turned
[10:56] around and said baptized in the name of
[10:58] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[11:00] Christ. Well he done exactly what
[11:03] Matthew if he said father son Holy Ghost
[11:05] wouldn't be mentally right.
[11:08] Now,
[11:11] &gt;&gt; why are you baptized, brother Brand? In
[11:12] the name of of Jesus Christ. Now, let us
[11:16] turn over here now and let's watch. Now,
[11:19] who had the keys to the kingdom?
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Peter.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Who was it spoke on the day of Pentecost
[11:24] now and said, um, repent and be baptized
[11:27] everyone in the name of Jesus Christ.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; That's Peter.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; All right. And the key is locked. What
[11:31] you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven.
[11:33] Is that right?
[11:34] What you loose on earth, I'll loose in
[11:36] heaven. Is that right? Now, how many
[11:40] tribes are they of the earth?
[11:42] &gt;&gt; Three. Ham, Sham, and Sham, and Jacob's
[11:46] people. Now, that's Jew, Gentile, and
[11:48] Samaria. See? All right. They all sprung
[11:51] up from them three sons. If the God
[11:54] forgive me, saying if the Bible, right?
[11:56] Of course, that all earth was destroyed.
[11:58] But them them three boys. That that's
[12:00] exactly where our generation sprang
[12:01] from. Now
[12:04] three wise men came to see Jesus.
[12:07] The astronomy says that they fallen
[12:10] three different stars and these three
[12:11] stars came together and made the one
[12:13] star. You see and the three are one
[12:16] always. See now
[12:19] the three attributes of God makes one
[12:22] God. It's not God the father, son and
[12:25] holy ghost. It isn't three gods. Jesus
[12:28] Philip asked that question said Lord
[12:30] show us a father and it suffice. John 14
[12:32] he said I've been so long with you
[12:34] Philillip you don't know me
[12:37] he said when you have seen me you have
[12:39] seen the father now I was explaining
[12:41] this to some women one day and woman
[12:43] well said wait just a minute brother Ben
[12:45] said they are one that's right said so
[12:47] are you and your wife one I said but
[12:49] they're a different kind of one and she
[12:51] said I said oh she said no they're the
[12:53] same as you and your wife one I said oh
[12:55] no I said do you see me she said yes I
[12:58] said you see my wife she said no I don't
[13:00] even know I said then Jesus said when
[13:02] you see me you see the father. So they
[13:06] they are different kinds of one. See I
[13:08] said you see me but don't see my wife.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; But when you see Jesus you see God. He
[13:14] manifested God. He was a virginborn son
[13:18] and God the father which is the spirit
[13:20] dwelt in him. Now a lot lot of
[13:22] trinitarian people try to say I was
[13:24] debating it not long ago. I find out
[13:26] don't do no good.
[13:31] Because
[13:32] no man can come to God unless God formed
[13:36] him and called him before the foundation
[13:38] of the world.
[13:41] All the father has given me will come to
[13:44] me, said Jesus. See, and this man tried
[13:47] to say
[13:49] he was a trinitarian
[13:52] extremely. And he stood up before the
[13:54] class and he said, "My precious friend
[13:57] said,"Brother Bram is a one of the
[13:58] finest fellas." See, you see right
[14:01] there, I know the Jesus said, "You
[14:03] hypocrites. How can you say good things
[14:05] for out of abundance the heart speak of
[14:06] the mouth?" See, and so just trying to
[14:09] find favor with the people. He said,
[14:12] "This is a church of Christ, man, and a
[14:14] so-called church of Christ. Of course,
[14:16] they're against all the true teachings
[14:18] of the Bible almost, and you couldn't
[14:19] call them I don't mean to say anything
[14:20] against them people in there, but them
[14:22] ministers are, if you'll excuse
[14:25] expressions like the Irishman's owl, all
[14:27] fuss and feathers, no owl. So, that's
[14:29] just about the way it is. I think just
[14:32] they ain't got nothing to stand on. So,
[14:34] a modern Pharisee. Now he said, "But
[14:38] brother Bham has been like a uh in this
[14:41] discussion said wiggle out of everything
[14:44] like the worm in the lemon." But says,
[14:47] "I would like him to wiggle out of this
[14:49] one." And of course all debaters holds a
[14:52] key note to the last part of it. So then
[14:55] he said at the baptism in Matthew 3, the
[14:59] display of three persons, absolutely
[15:03] three distinct persons, the son standing
[15:06] on the back, the Holy Ghost like a dove
[15:08] in between them, God the Father speaking
[15:10] out of heaven.
[15:12] I said, "Sir, is that your keynote?" He
[15:16] said, "I want to hear you wiggle out of
[15:17] that one." I said, "Sir, you just wiggle
[15:20] back and read the scripture the way it
[15:22] reads." I said, "That's the only thing.
[15:24] You're just mistreating the scripture to
[15:25] the people." I said, "That is thinner
[15:28] than the broth made out of a shadow of a
[15:30] chicken is starved to death." I said,
[15:32] "Well, you're just you're you're you're
[15:34] making it wrong, brother. You're
[15:35] misreading it to the people." And I
[15:37] said, "Now look here what the brother
[15:38] says." Now, I'll take it like this. Like
[15:40] these I got father, son, holy ghost.
[15:42] Now, this here it be the Holy Ghost son,
[15:44] Israel, Father. And watch how they read
[15:46] it. When Jesus was baptized, went
[15:49] straight way out of the water. Lo, the
[15:51] heavens opened unto him, and he saw the
[15:53] spirit of God like a dove descending,
[15:55] and a voice from heaven saying, "This is
[15:57] my beloved son in whom I'm pleased to
[15:58] dwell." I said, "See, three beautiful
[16:01] illustrations. The son on the ground,
[16:03] the Holy Ghost like a dove in between,
[16:06] and the father out of heaven speaking."
[16:09] See how the devil can stand there and
[16:11] deceive a person? If you don't have the
[16:13] revelation of God, of God isn't mercy to
[16:15] us, we ought to be thankful.
[16:18] He made that say something he didn't
[16:19] say. Just like Matthew 28:19, make them
[16:22] say something it don't say. He never
[16:23] said baptize them. He never said baptize
[16:26] in the name of the father and the name
[16:27] of the son and the name of the holy
[16:28] ghost. Said baptize them in the name of
[16:30] the father, son, and holy ghost which is
[16:31] Jesus Christ. Now let us take this
[16:35] illustration. Now let's see
[16:40] you're getting the scriptures wrote
[16:41] down. Matthew 3 there last three or four
[16:44] verses. Now
[16:45] &gt;&gt; I just depending on her right
[16:50] from her and
[16:50] &gt;&gt; you can study it when you get I'm giving
[16:52] you scripture so you can study it alone.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Now look notice now they say that was a
[16:57] son standing on the bank. This is God
[17:00] the Holy Ghost like a dove in between
[17:02] them
[17:02] &gt;&gt; and God the father was speaking out of
[17:04] the heaven. Now look like that make
[17:06] exactly three different voices in three
[17:08] different places.
[17:10] Now
[17:11] notice now when Jesus is baptized now we
[17:15] realize that heavens is means above
[17:18] atmospheres whatever it is into heaven.
[17:21] Now when Jesus is baptized he went
[17:23] straight way out of the water and lo the
[17:25] heavens was open unto him and he saw the
[17:27] spirit of God.
[17:32] I thought they said God was up in heaven
[17:34] speaking
[17:36] the spirit of God like a dove. The devil
[17:39] was God.
[17:41] See, we just got through it here. Holy
[17:43] Ghost and God the same person.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; See, it's just a title to it. See, and
[17:49] he saw the spirit of God, not rather God
[17:51] up in heaven speaking, but the spirit of
[17:54] God was in the form of a dove. That was
[17:55] that was the Holy Ghost. It was God in
[17:57] the same name. See the spirit of God
[17:59] like a dove descend and a voice from
[18:00] heaven which was above him saying this
[18:03] is my beloved son in whom I am pleased
[18:06] to dwell
[18:08] the right translation you got the verb
[18:10] before the adverb like all the foreign
[18:12] it's this is my beloved son in whom I am
[18:15] pleased to dwell in or whom I am pleased
[18:17] to dwell in whom I am pleased to dwell
[18:22] that was God coming into Jesus and in
[18:25] him was the fullness of the godhead
[18:27] bodily
[18:28] And there is your father, son, and holy
[18:29] ghost
[18:32] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Sure.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; There's no there's no place in the Bible
[18:38] speaks of three being a three gods.
[18:42] There's no such a thing. It's absolutely
[18:45] pagan. It come from pagan.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; That's the way with the trinity.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, surely it's just as it's just
[18:52] as bottomless as hell is. See, there's
[18:55] no such thing. needs that.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Billy Graham needs that.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, he was
[19:00] &gt;&gt; I needed it, too. Billy Graham.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; It's revealed to those who God calls and
[19:05] is predestinated by his fornowledge. All
[19:08] my sheep hear my voice.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; See,
[19:11] &gt;&gt; look at them Jews stand there just as
[19:13] scholarly as they could be. And Jesus
[19:15] showing them he was Messiah by Messiah
[19:17] sign that said he's beyond.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; How could they were blinded?
[19:21] &gt;&gt; And drew a ragged shepherd on the hill.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and a little ragged shepherd or a
[19:26] or a fisherman down the river said they
[19:29] know it. You see, he just God has a way
[19:32] of doing things and we just have to cope
[19:34] with his way. I just be thankful that
[19:36] your eyes could be open to see truth.
[19:38] Now, I challenge anybody,
[19:42] not for not for fussing, but will come
[19:44] to me and sit down and show me trinity
[19:47] one time in the Bible where there's
[19:48] three gods. If you show me three gods,
[19:51] I'll show you we're in darkness and
[19:52] pagans and heathens. There's only one
[19:55] God.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; God the father truly we believe that he
[19:59] was up and above all over this mountain
[20:02] when he sitted on the mountain up there.
[20:03] Why? Even if a as much as a cow touched
[20:06] the mountain had to be killed. God the
[20:08] father but he wanted fellowship back
[20:11] with his man. He's trying to get man
[20:13] back to the Eden place where he was
[20:14] lost. See now the next thing he did then
[20:18] God the father overshadowed a virgin
[20:21] called Mary. And the hemoglobin, you
[20:24] know this by being a nurse. The blood
[20:27] cell comes from the male.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Then somebody said, "We're saved by
[20:31] Jewish blood."
[20:33] There's not one speck of the mother's
[20:34] blood in the baby. The baby lays in the
[20:37] blood of the mother,
[20:39] &gt;&gt; but the blood cell comes from the male
[20:41] sex. So he wasn't neither Jew nor
[20:44] Gentile. He was God.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; A creative blood, not by sex desire, but
[20:49] a creative blood. See what I mean?
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then God's blood saved us an
[20:55] unadulterated blood. He created himself.
[20:58] I mean he changed his cast from God to
[21:01] man and came down was born of a virgin
[21:04] Mary and the Holy Ghost which is God his
[21:07] father that overshadowed it came down
[21:10] and spread his tent and dwelt with us in
[21:14] the form of a man. That's God the son.
[21:19] the same God that was God the Father. It
[21:22] isn't me that doeth the works. It's my
[21:24] father that dwelleth in me. He doeth the
[21:27] works. See
[21:28] &gt;&gt; that? In me.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. The father that dwells
[21:34] tabernacles lives. This is my beloved
[21:38] son in whom I am pleased to dwell in.
[21:40] Matthew 3. See, in whom I am pleased to
[21:44] dwell. I am very pleased to dwell in
[21:46] this one. Dwell. But to occupy, come in
[21:49] the house and live. In him was the
[21:51] fullness of the godhead bodily, says the
[21:54] script.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Image of the invisible God.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. The visible image of the
[21:57] invisible God. Now there he is. Now
[22:01] that's God the Father, God the Son, and
[22:05] now through breaking that blood cell.
[22:08] When the old priest in the Old Testament
[22:10] of the Old Order, a sinner brought a
[22:12] lamb. He laid his hand upon the lamb.
[22:16] His throat was cut because he sinned and
[22:18] this lamb died for his sin. Now the
[22:21] reason he went out says Hebrews with the
[22:23] same desire that he had coming if he
[22:25] committed adultery. He goes back out
[22:26] with the same desire. If he could kill
[22:28] it goes back out same desire hatred
[22:30] because when that blood cell lamb was
[22:32] broke that blood cell in the lamb was an
[22:35] animal's life.
[22:38] It could not come back and dwell in a
[22:39] human life because the animal life has
[22:41] no soul.
[22:43] But the human life has a soul.
[22:46] See, animal don't have a soul. We don't
[22:48] know. No, you don't have to wear clothes
[22:50] and cover up it snakeness and say bad
[22:52] words and you know what I mean.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; See, they they don't know it. They fell
[22:56] because they're under us. See, human
[22:59] beings are above the animal life because
[23:01] they're a god of the animal life. That's
[23:03] right. It was in the beginning because
[23:05] Adam named them and had power over
[23:07] Genesis 1:26. He had dominion over all
[23:09] the earth. He was he was made in the
[23:12] image of God and was made to be a lesser
[23:14] god. Jesus said so said not your law say
[23:17] that you're gods and if they call them
[23:19] gods who the word of God came to you
[23:21] which was prophet how do you condemn me
[23:23] when I send the son of god? See, there
[23:25] we are. Now
[23:28] [Music]
