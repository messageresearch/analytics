[28:11] we just want to send this out this
[28:13] morning and as a special message to our
[28:17] sisters to our mother and also to the
[28:20] Bride of Christ amen
[28:23] praise the Lord amen because I realized
[28:29] that you know brother Brennan talks
[28:32] about the woman you know and through
[28:35] many of the messages but he had a Bride
[28:38] of Christ in mind and sometimes we get
[28:41] stuck with the you know with the
[28:43] physical woman and then we don't go
[28:46] forward to see that she was a prophecy
[28:48] of the bride so we would we would look
[28:51] in Revelation I mean that Genesis
[28:53] chapter 3 this morning let's read verse
[28:58] 15 actually man Texas from Rome from
[29:02] verse 16 I would read from verse 16 the
[29:10] reason why they stuck out to me this
[29:12] morning
[29:13] verse 16 years says and on to the woman
[29:16] he said I will greatly multiply thy
[29:18] sorrow and that conception in sorrow
[29:22] thou shalt bring forth children and the
[29:26] desire shall be unto the husband and he
[29:29] shall rule over thee verse 20 verse 20
[29:38] and Adam called his wife's name Eve
[29:43] because she was the mother of all living
[29:50] praise the Lord let us pray father we
[29:54] want to once again father commit this
[29:57] word into your hands
[29:58] this word father is sacred this is your
[30:02] world India law we pray the father you
[30:05] would come just like you did to this man
[30:07] on the role of a Myers Lord God when you
[30:10] enter in shouting with you you broke
[30:13] bread the eyes were open open our has
[30:16] this more
[30:16] to be able to receive from you in Jesus
[30:19] name we pray amen praise the Lord the
[30:22] Lord bless you
[30:23] now Adam here he called his wife named
[30:28] Eve because she was the mother of all
[30:31] living
[30:31] naturally he called his wife Eve after
[30:34] he realized the promise that God has
[30:37] given to her the Bible says over in
[30:42] chapter 2 and chapter 2 verse 23 the
[30:51] Bible says and Adam said now this is now
[30:56] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh
[30:59] flesh she shall be called woman now
[31:03] after he came out of his deep sleep he
[31:07] says oh wow
[31:08] this is bone of my bone and flesh of my
[31:12] flesh she shall be called woman but
[31:16] after he heard the promise that God has
[31:19] given to the woman he said her name
[31:23] shall be called Eve the mother of all
[31:27] living
[31:28] praise the Lord I think every time I
[31:34] said he said or she said this thing
[31:38] thing I'm saying Siri praise the Lord
[31:44] Amen so we won't talk yet on the mother
[31:51] of all living
[31:52] praise the Lord and so father he can
[32:05] just capture my little Hebrew definition
[32:10] that I was looking at that this morning
[32:13] as I was quickly trying to together this
[32:18] little thought on my heart for to be
[32:22] able to encourage
[32:25] praise Allah we we realize we are living
[32:29] in social day and social age were I mean
[32:34] we should be grateful for every gif of
[32:38] life that God has given to us praise the
[32:42] Lord and and we are thankful this
[32:47] morning I mean we can we can Ostrow back
[32:52] in our mind to our child who bathing you
[32:56] know and just gather all the pressure
[32:59] memories of our mama praise the Lord
[33:02] but we're gonna talk about the women
[33:09] characters of the Bible a little bit we
[33:12] we get to few of them and we get to few
[33:19] of them if the Lord is able to help us
[33:21] this morning wish of course he's the one
[33:23] that we are depending on for him to help
[33:26] us now we will see here in the world as
[33:30] we would travel with this and just like
[33:36] Paul said in the book of Hebrew I mean
[33:40] the book of Romans he said true one man
[33:43] he won't lay our representation he said
[33:47] true one man Adam you know you know God
[33:52] place all our representation in our
[33:56] Father Adam so also there is a
[33:59] representation I was placed in our
[34:01] mothers Eve and we will look at this
[34:05] this morning to be able to to trust the
[34:10] law to be able to bring out here what a
[34:12] wonderful gift a mother is praise the
[34:15] Lord
[34:15] what a wonderful gift a mother is and I
[34:20] mean she's gifted right from the time
[34:25] that God you know made her praise the
[34:28] Lord
[34:29] she's gifted we will also look at the
[34:32] vet use the brother Branham says God
[34:35] gave to the woman and just just thing
[34:38] about this name
[34:39] she's born with that gift beside gift
[34:42] and calling that is with our repentance
[34:45] there are three divine sacred gift God
[34:48] put in a woman she's born with it a man
[34:52] is not born with Sacre gift of God even
[34:55] though if he is a preacher or whatever
[34:58] he is is a gift and calling with our
[35:00] repentance but there was no gift in his
[35:02] makeup like the woman when God made a
[35:08] woman after he put Adam to sleep in
[35:11] making a woman there were he plays those
[35:14] three Sacre virtue in her praise Lord so
[35:18] we want to look out of there those up
[35:20] those are very beautiful gift you know I
[35:23] mean things that makes a woman to be a
[35:27] mother to be patient you know you know a
[35:32] mother to to have that the kind of
[35:37] nature and the kind of a character that
[35:39] I have is because it's a gift from God
[35:43] it's a gift from God praise the Lord and
[35:47] and we are grateful for all of that so
[35:50] we look through the scripture and look
[35:52] at a few biblical women and see the kind
[35:56] of a gift that was in them and every one
[35:58] of them in some way was was representing
[36:03] they had a representation in Eve so we
[36:06] see here this was beautiful when I saw
[36:09] they this morning in Hebron and use a
[36:12] Hebrew word year which means birth you
[36:15] know the birth that we breathe to live
[36:18] or to give life and the traditional
[36:25] meaning of Eve is living she's the
[36:28] mother of all living
[36:30] but you think about this think about
[36:33] this just like I said Adam called his
[36:35] wife Eve after he heard the promise of
[36:37] redemption that was given to her and and
[36:42] and this woman Eve as we will look
[36:45] through the different types here
[36:47] she's a type of the last day bride that
[36:50] is not going to fall
[36:52] praise the Lord and you will see what a
[36:55] mystery it is because in a beginning she
[36:57] fell so god's attribute can be
[37:00] manifested but she was a type of a bride
[37:03] that that wasn't that is not going to
[37:05] fall which means there was some
[37:07] potential in Eve that she could have not
[37:10] for if God did not allow it if she if if
[37:16] she's typing the endtime bride that
[37:18] would never fall then we have to we have
[37:21] to look you know between the lines and
[37:24] see that because of a plan of redemption
[37:27] that's why the four came now but I was
[37:31] looking at this also and you look in st.
[37:35] John chapter 20 verse 22 when Jesus
[37:39] appeared to his disciple the scripture
[37:43] says he breathed upon them and he said
[37:48] receive ye the Holy Ghost praise the
[37:52] Lord he breathed on them and he said
[37:56] receive yet the Holy Ghost then it was
[37:59] it was strange because we realized here
[38:03] that Jesus resurrecting was just like
[38:11] Adam coming from out of his deep sleep
[38:16] now so there was going to be a change of
[38:19] dispensation just like how Adam when he
[38:22] saw his wife from his deep sleep he said
[38:26] this is flesh of my flesh bone of my
[38:29] bone and she will be called woman now
[38:31] Jesus after the resurrection when he
[38:34] appeared to his disciples the scripture
[38:36] says he breathed on them and he says
[38:40] receive ye the Holy Ghost which means
[38:43] the same way that Adam did was the same
[38:46] thing that Jesus was doing you are flesh
[38:49] of my flesh you are bone of my bone you
[38:51] are spirit of my spirit life of my life
[38:54] received the Holy Ghost because that's
[38:56] what the Holy Ghost will bring to the
[38:58] church so if the
[39:03] Hebrew word for for Eve
[39:06] holes the meaning of breath then we can
[39:14] see why he briefed up on the church
[39:16] because she was going to be the second
[39:19] Eve she was going to have the life of
[39:24] God praise the Lord even though the Holy
[39:31] Ghost was not given yet but he breathed
[39:33] upon the church just like when Adam came
[39:37] out of his deep sleep saying that you
[39:39] are going to be life of my life she's
[39:45] the mother of all living
[39:47] praise the Lord Genesis chapter 5 let's
[39:52] look at verse 2 Genesis chapter 5 verse
[40:00] 2 the Bible says first one this is the
[40:04] book of the generation of Adam in the
[40:07] day that God created man in the likeness
[40:10] of God may he him male and female
[40:15] created he them and blessed them and
[40:18] called their name Adam in the day when
[40:22] they were created in the day when they
[40:25] were created God called them Adam when
[40:28] God brought Eve out of Adam Adam woke up
[40:32] he says woman praise the Lord
[40:35] when God give if the promise of
[40:38] redemption he says she will be called
[40:40] Eve the mother of all living
[40:42] now you see how in all of the changes of
[40:46] those name just like how God Elohim
[40:49] change
[40:50] siren name from Sarah - Sarah because it
[40:53] was time for the promise on to come that
[40:56] was a very same thing that was playing
[40:57] out through the scripture in the day
[40:59] that they were created God said go home
[41:02] Adam both Adam and Eve because he
[41:05] created both of them the same male and
[41:09] female created he them in His image and
[41:13] called them Adam
[41:17] praise the Lord Adam for a period of
[41:19] time was carrying his bride and he could
[41:24] look at all the animals male and female
[41:26] male and female male and female praise
[41:31] the Lord
[41:32] and trying to look for his female
[41:38] partner he has to keep turning around he
[41:41] keep turning around because she was
[41:44] right on his side praise the Lord and
[41:49] when God brought Eve out the Bible said
[41:52] he said flesh of my flesh bone of my
[41:54] bone she will be called woman wish of
[41:56] course that word actually means a man
[41:59] with a womb that's what it means it
[42:07] actually means a man with a womb because
[42:11] what was going to happen here we have to
[42:13] remember that the spoken word is the
[42:16] original see so right from the beginning
[42:18] God was bringing out his word and his
[42:22] plan of redemption in a form of a seed
[42:26] praise the Lord
[42:28] so he has made a man in in in his image
[42:32] to be the seed bearer and also he's
[42:35] going to make and not a man in His image
[42:38] that is going to be the bearer of the
[42:39] see because that's what the woman is
[42:46] praise Allah we would go would travel a
[42:49] little bit we'll read from the prophet
[42:51] and then we will see that as we go
[42:53] together but just to be able to laid
[42:57] this foundation in us as we look at any
[43:00] year you have to remember verbatim who
[43:03] says this in in the message invisible
[43:06] Union of the Bride of Christ he said the
[43:12] a woman is trusted with certain
[43:17] character that she must not define now I
[43:20] kind of adjust a book I pull out some
[43:23] few things that is just pointing
[43:25] directly to what I want to talk about so
[43:28] we will just keep the subject in mind
[43:30] but because she was cast over on that
[43:36] side we signed when God brought the
[43:39] image from Genesis chapter 126 he put
[43:43] both of them in Adam so she was cast off
[43:46] on that side that's what he's talking
[43:49] about that's that's the reason why over
[43:52] and over he would say she was not in the
[43:54] original creation because she was cast
[43:56] off in the man so he says she has also
[44:02] been given a sacred charge from God for
[44:06] redemption for redemption I don't know
[44:11] how to overemphasize that she was giving
[44:15] the sacred charge of God for redemption
[44:18] let's go back to our Bibles we will look
[44:21] at some few things here as we travel
[44:23] alone verse Genesis chapter 2 verse 21
[44:32] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[44:35] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[44:40] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[44:44] and stared there off and the rib which
[44:48] the Lord God has taken from man made he
[44:52] a woman and brought her unto Him like
[44:57] I've always said we see how in in the
[45:01] plan of redemption God has to make a
[45:04] deep sleep to fall on Abraham and and
[45:07] year is it also here God bringing out
[45:10] the woman he had to make a deep sleep to
[45:13] fall on on the man and then the Bible
[45:16] say he took a trip now in death and
[45:19] death darkness what looks like a
[45:22] darkness a deep sleep there he formed a
[45:26] woman why because he was placing this
[45:31] sack rivetti
[45:32] in her that even the devil would not be
[45:34] able to find now I remember is because
[45:37] it's for redemption and redemption is
[45:43] God's playing it's the plain that he had
[45:47] right in the back of his mind all the
[45:50] mysteries in the Bible was because of
[45:52] redemption so he will write that in the
[45:59] nature of the woman and he will cause it
[46:04] to be dag in a form of a deep sleep that
[46:08] would come upon Adam and right in there
[46:13] there were he would give the woman all
[46:16] of these sacra batteries now brother
[46:18] Branham he he types it out he showed us
[46:22] the natural type in a woman a virgin say
[46:27] a woman who mother who he says in the
[46:31] church is the same thing he has given
[46:34] the church that sac referred to you
[46:36] which is the word and a prayer he sees
[46:43] the word prayer and there's a tear one I
[46:50] would get to it just nanus would go
[46:52] along now so because I want us to keep
[46:55] the church in mind now so so we would
[46:58] not be able to lose our place here he
[47:00] says the woman was entrusted with this
[47:02] setting character that she must not
[47:04] defined because she was cast on their
[47:08] side she has also been given a sacrifice
[47:13] from God for redemption she's got a
[47:16] character that she must not define
[47:18] notice now we find that her body is a
[47:25] bearing ground that's the reason why I
[47:28] use I used the word when I said the
[47:33] woman means you know a man before womb
[47:36] because she was the one I was going to
[47:38] be a bearing Graham I was talking to a
[47:40] sister and we were just talking about
[47:42] you know how the bride you know it's a
[47:45] manifestation and she says something
[47:46] beautiful she said but one have you ever
[47:48] thought how a man goes out and he's
[47:52] shopping you know he buy the meat he buy
[47:55] the vegetables he buy all of these
[47:57] he brings it home and the woman has the
[47:59] ability to take the very thing that he
[48:02] gave her to change it to a meal she has
[48:07] that ability to take the raw meat take
[48:10] the vegetable take all the spices all
[48:13] those elements and she can and she can
[48:15] just put flavor that puts him to sleep
[48:22] that's the ability she has it's a gift
[48:25] right from God amen praise the Lord so
[48:30] and therefore it is it is it is a sacred
[48:34] trust
[48:35] it must not be defined now I'm saying
[48:40] now bringing this to an illustration to
[48:44] show you where the church stands that is
[48:48] the place we want to get to this morning
[48:50] as we look at the different types of the
[48:54] woman we want to bring our self to the
[48:57] place to show us where the church stands
[49:01] the mother of all living
[49:04] praise the Lord because that is a
[49:08] promise to the church we have to make
[49:10] the word to live again we cannot just
[49:15] take a church name and be satisfied
[49:18] where Benham says the reason why God
[49:21] gave Adam and Eve is for him to for him
[49:24] to produce himself and that's the reason
[49:27] why God gave Christ a bride to make the
[49:30] word live again because she's the mother
[49:33] of all living
[49:34] the church has the power to put this
[49:37] Bible on two feet like Paul says we are
[49:40] written episode read of all men we have
[49:43] the power to do it we have been given
[49:46] that Sacre trust of God that's why we
[49:52] want to talk about this morning that's
[49:55] the reason why God play all of these
[49:58] things out in time just like how Eve she
[50:01] represents I mean you know the woman
[50:05] that God was giving let's look for an
[50:07] example look at Noah's wife that's not
[50:09] mushed
[50:10] they said about her in the Bible but
[50:14] what we know is that Noah was found
[50:18] righteous before God and he was able to
[50:23] preach a message for 120 years and he
[50:28] had his sons to be able to support him
[50:32] but as I thought about it this morning I
[50:35] said Noah success in his calling I can
[50:39] attribute that to his wife because what
[50:43] a man needs is a woman that would
[50:47] believe in him
[50:49] now if Noah wife did not believe his
[50:52] message it would be hard for the
[50:54] children to support him for Noah's
[50:59] sounds and their wives to support no 100
[51:04] in 20 years when the entire generation
[51:07] is growing wide the entire generation is
[51:10] growing contrary is because they hire a
[51:13] mother that taught them to believe in
[51:16] their father and I wanted to believe him
[51:23] but to support him for what he's doing
[51:27] and I'll tell you that just what a man
[51:30] needs I mean that's just what a man
[51:35] needs because that is all that God asks
[51:38] us to do only belief praise the Lord
[51:42] that all he asks us to do only believe
[51:45] believe I'm your provider believe I can
[51:48] heal you believe I'm in control
[51:51] that's all he asks us to do only belief
[51:58] praise the Lord
[52:00] so you see God wholly in Eve life and
[52:05] mystery oh it looks like she was not a
[52:11] believer oh and and and we can say all
[52:14] sorts of things that we I mean that we
[52:17] try to say about Eve but she was the
[52:21] first daughter that came from the hands
[52:23] of God and
[52:24] must know we must learn to respect her
[52:26] because she's a type of the Bride of
[52:28] Christ she says type of every godly
[52:31] woman in the scripture praise the Lord
[52:34] amen
[52:35] but we were seeing here their God
[52:40] because he he played like brother
[52:43] Branham said Jesus rebuked those men on
[52:46] the role of mrs and says all full slow
[52:49] of heart why because God slowly unfold
[52:53] his mystery he has chosen people in
[52:56] every age to be able to bring out a
[53:00] portion of what he's doing all through
[53:02] the ages so he played her part Eve was
[53:09] the one that was going to set the the
[53:12] the manifestation of God's attribute in
[53:20] every character that she horse was now
[53:24] distributed to different women
[53:26] throughout the ages
[53:30] no our wife comes out she's representing
[53:35] a church that would believe God's Word
[53:37] when the whole world is going crazy when
[53:40] the whole world will doubt the message
[53:42] she and her children she in her house
[53:46] she's a type of that woman up there
[53:50] solomon spoke about improv herb she in
[53:53] her house she would teach her house
[53:58] praise the Lord in so much that Noah
[54:02] sounds their wives was still with the
[54:05] husband praise the Lord
[54:10] and we also see Sarah remember them
[54:14] they're those sacred trust Sarah right
[54:17] there means princess what the God he'll
[54:24] play out in her life the changing of the
[54:27] body praise the Lord the changing of the
[54:33] body remember this was the very woman
[54:36] from the beginning she trusts
[54:37] God she believed her husband Abraham as
[54:42] the went on and on and she was getting
[54:45] weaker and getting weaker
[54:48] she's like off and an abroad in Hagen
[54:52] praise the Lord and Ishmael was born
[54:57] that you know that didn't matter Oh God
[54:59] off that did not make God to say well
[55:02] I'm going to pack this woman aside why
[55:04] because he has given his promise to
[55:06] Abraham and to kick Sarah off is to kick
[55:09] Abraham off praise the Lord
[55:14] so what God is going to do he's going to
[55:16] build an edge around them to bring his
[55:19] word to father even Abimelech to even
[55:25] visit a foreign King by vision a Bimala
[55:29] we have a visitation from God because of
[55:31] Sarah his name will be pleased in the
[55:35] Holy Scripture because of Sarah why
[55:37] because she was hauling in her body and
[55:40] mystery of the body change so God watch
[55:48] over her God in her and so much that the
[55:56] Bible said that we read there all the
[55:58] time the Bible says and the scripture
[56:00] said put away the bound woman God was so
[56:04] pleased with that I mean she brought her
[56:07] in and she has the right to kick her out
[56:09] just like he said in the book of Judges
[56:14] he told the children of Israel you know
[56:16] you have compromised and with these
[56:19] foreign King I'm not going to take him
[56:21] away you have to fight him out and
[56:27] sometimes won't take decision to be able
[56:30] to deal with things that we compromise
[56:32] with God is pleased with it he says cast
[56:35] out the bondwoman so in Sarah she held
[56:38] the mystery of the body change and she
[56:41] brought for the promise he'd praise the
[56:45] Lord there's a woman that came under the
[56:48] shadow of death there was lots wife
[56:53] amen LOB's was abraham nephew abraham
[56:59] hide him in a Johnny
[57:02] praise the Lord and we realized that I
[57:07] mean Abraham never had no problem with
[57:10] this boy until he got a wife now there
[57:13] was the now had to be arguing over whose
[57:16] ship is this and worship is that and you
[57:19] know he was influenced to go down to the
[57:22] city of lot I mean a city of Sodom but
[57:26] now realized here that lot he have had
[57:30] lot of his upbringing in its training
[57:33] from Abraham II I mean he's been in his
[57:35] house he saw how he was leading devotion
[57:37] he saw the faithfulness of Abraham he
[57:39] saw how everyone believed in a
[57:42] supernatural God and Abraham kept
[57:44] talking about this God they had promised
[57:46] him to be the father of Nations and
[57:50] because of Abraham prayer the angels
[57:54] were go down to sodam to bring Lord and
[57:57] his family out but you see this woman
[58:03] that was called Lot's wife the scripture
[58:09] make us to realize that she used her
[58:13] pass to destroy her future even though
[58:20] the angel came down and said I can do
[58:22] nothing until you get out of here yes
[58:29] that was the instruction that was given
[58:31] to lot I can do nothing Sodom is
[58:35] condemned nothing I can do until you get
[58:38] out of here and Lord and his family took
[58:43] the journey and the angel warned them
[58:45] don't look to your pass don't turn
[58:49] around
[58:50] but she use her pass to destroy her
[58:55] future praise the Lord
[59:01] you see it in there that's that's the
[59:02] reason why over and over bourbon will
[59:05] show us two camps you know he will show
[59:07] us the angels that went down to Sodom
[59:10] but on the other side there was danger
[59:13] and and and and in Abraham's camp praise
[59:20] the Lord we see the Rebecca Rebecca will
[59:30] hold a type in her life that even though
[59:35] she had not seen Isaac but yes she will
[59:38] believe the messenger that toho ever
[59:41] Isaac she have not seen Isaac yet and
[59:47] everything that she knows about Isaac
[59:50] came true Eliezer that's the kind of
[59:55] what type that she holds for the end
[59:57] time right she have not seen Isaac and
[1:00:02] Jesus came and then he praised Rebecca
[1:00:05] he said blessed are those that have not
[1:00:07] seen but belief first Jesus prays
[1:00:14] Rebecca he said blessed those that have
[1:00:16] that same but belief because that's what
[1:00:22] Rebecca was hauling all through the
[1:00:25] scripture all her life her parents
[1:00:28] brought her up the mystery that was in
[1:00:30] her life now should we get to this place
[1:00:33] where she would just believe this
[1:00:35] stranger and then I would just come and
[1:00:39] start telling her tales about a boy from
[1:00:42] the fire country and she would believe
[1:00:44] it
[1:00:45] inasmuch dead right before her parents
[1:00:49] the answer Rebecca will you go she said
[1:00:52] how we go
[1:00:53] she was so caught by the story the LEDs
[1:00:56] I have told her about this Prince Isaac
[1:01:01] she said I will go the mother of all
[1:01:07] living
[1:01:07] now you have to realize that God in
[1:01:10] every age was bringing a little a little
[1:01:14] of
[1:01:15] was in EVE everything that was in EVE
[1:01:18] all the sacred trust and their their
[1:01:21] their their the ability that she has
[1:01:23] that she could not displayed in Eden God
[1:01:27] distributed three throughout the ages
[1:01:30] that is the reason why this endtime
[1:01:33] Church can represent Eve because it was
[1:01:38] being played out it was being played out
[1:01:40] until it came to that woman Mary that
[1:01:43] said be it unto me I call into that word
[1:01:46] let me not get ahead of myself day a lot
[1:01:48] of them we have to talk about this
[1:01:49] morning praise the Lord Amen glory to
[1:01:55] God or we tank the Lord praise the Lord
[1:01:59] amen and then we can talk about richer
[1:02:03] praise the Lord we talked about Richard
[1:02:06] a Jacob went down there actually you
[1:02:09] know he he loved nature but Lebon being
[1:02:15] a business man you know God here on a
[1:02:19] type was going to play out you know what
[1:02:22] it would still play out the Jewish
[1:02:24] Church in the Gentile church you know
[1:02:27] but yet we realized that Richard she had
[1:02:31] a mystery that she had in her life amen
[1:02:35] you have to remember that over and over
[1:02:38] the Prophet Zacharias
[1:02:40] I mean Jeremiah sorry he talks about
[1:02:43] Richard you know a woman weeping for her
[1:02:47] children amen
[1:02:49] so Richard was the weeping mother she
[1:02:54] had that mystery that she had in her
[1:02:58] life you think about it how many years
[1:03:00] that she wept when she saw her sister
[1:03:02] Leah bringing children and she could not
[1:03:05] have the Bible says she went over to to
[1:03:09] Jacob and says give me trial is a die so
[1:03:13] you could see how her heart was filled
[1:03:16] with lamentation or mine I was just
[1:03:21] reading that book and I just kept
[1:03:23] thinking about it you know lamentation I
[1:03:26] mean that is one care
[1:03:28] that God gives to his people because
[1:03:33] there is a language that is Elementary
[1:03:36] in the only galkin year I mean when a
[1:03:38] person is is lamenting is almost like
[1:03:41] you are speaking tongues praise the Lord
[1:03:45] because I mean you are saying words you
[1:03:49] are saying things out of out of your
[1:03:51] grieve out of your cry but there are no
[1:03:54] words that the human you know ears can
[1:03:57] understand that is the reason why Eli
[1:04:00] taught that Hannah was was drunk she was
[1:04:04] weeping before God she was uttering
[1:04:06] words that he could not make sense out
[1:04:09] of because the language of lamenting is
[1:04:12] not for humans the language of lamenting
[1:04:16] is for God when a person is really
[1:04:19] crying out their soul to God praise the
[1:04:24] Lord
[1:04:25] so Richard she represented she had she
[1:04:29] had a mystery the Bible says in travail
[1:04:32] she will bring forth you know she had a
[1:04:34] mystery of the bride I will be able to
[1:04:37] bring forth I mean with weeping and
[1:04:39] crying and the many things that will
[1:04:41] have to bear throughout the ages look at
[1:04:43] the church the kind of a painting and
[1:04:45] destruction that the church has come
[1:04:48] true but she stays standing praise the
[1:04:51] Lord
[1:04:52] richer she was holding the mystery of a
[1:04:56] weeping mother now even even in her last
[1:05:02] childbirth she crying out the name of
[1:05:06] Benjamin praise the Lord and over and
[1:05:12] over what can we say about Jack Abed
[1:05:17] that's another mother praise the Lord
[1:05:20] Amen that was that was that was that was
[1:05:24] ready to sacrifice her son not only in
[1:05:29] the sense of sacrificing him to lose his
[1:05:31] life but she just believed that you know
[1:05:35] the angel of the Lord was going to watch
[1:05:39] over this boy she did not fear the Kings
[1:05:43] come I mean amen
[1:05:45] she did not fear the Kings coming and
[1:05:49] she put him right on the leg and send
[1:05:52] the sister go by the lake and wash your
[1:05:56] little brother and and and and and just
[1:05:57] think about it the Raven I feel with
[1:06:00] krokodil what a fit that she has that
[1:06:02] she would be able to put her son you
[1:06:04] know in the hands of God just like
[1:06:07] Hannah said you give me the son I would
[1:06:09] give him back to you
[1:06:11] amen that was the kind of a mother the
[1:06:15] mother of all living
[1:06:18] praise the Lord she was protecting the
[1:06:21] life of her son because she's a life
[1:06:23] giver and the scripture say he said and
[1:06:29] we know God honor her faith God was so
[1:06:32] pleased with her faith until God
[1:06:34] rewarded her that she was paid to take
[1:06:36] care of her own son God was so pleased
[1:06:42] with a fit that she has until God
[1:06:45] rewarded her he never waited for her to
[1:06:48] get to heaven before she receive a
[1:06:49] reward God reward her right on earth
[1:06:52] that she would take care of her son she
[1:06:54] would tell him the promises of Jehovah
[1:06:56] she would train him she was sold the
[1:06:58] seed of righteousness
[1:07:00] that's what better Brennan actually took
[1:07:01] the fifth gospel from when he talks
[1:07:05] about the fifth gospel he goes back to
[1:07:07] Jacobin that she was the one right in
[1:07:12] the house of Pharaoh to plan the Seas of
[1:07:15] Jehovah in the heart of Moses that when
[1:07:18] he grew up to be forty years those words
[1:07:20] of Jacob air would stop haunting him
[1:07:22] those words would stop playing in his
[1:07:25] mind the mother of all living
[1:07:29] praise the Lord Amen you see just like
[1:07:34] Lot's wife she used her past to destroy
[1:07:38] her future but this woman called Rahab
[1:07:42] she had a horrible past and she was not
[1:07:45] she was not she was determined not to
[1:07:47] look back in the past
[1:07:48] she believed the messenger she hanged at
[1:07:52] talking on her she was ready to get out
[1:07:54] of her pass and not to look back because
[1:07:57] Joshua told her your entire pass is
[1:08:00] going to be destroy this entire world is
[1:08:02] coming down that was what the spies to
[1:08:05] her and she was ready to believe their
[1:08:07] message look to her future not even
[1:08:10] knowing what the future was going to be
[1:08:12] but she looked to the future praise the
[1:08:17] Lord and God honor her faith
[1:08:20] bless her future to be married by a
[1:08:24] Hebrew sodium man a general and also to
[1:08:28] be listed in the lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:08:30] god bless her future praise the Lord all
[1:08:35] we can just look at the mother of living
[1:08:38] soul the mother of all living
[1:08:40] we realized here it is this sacred trust
[1:08:44] that God gave the woman in the beginning
[1:08:48] that is working out here in all of these
[1:08:51] spiritual attributes there is something
[1:08:57] about her that is attached to life and
[1:09:02] it's all speaking about the endtime
[1:09:05] Church it's all speaking about the bride
[1:09:08] of Jesus Christ God gave her these
[1:09:14] sacred trust it's a gift she's born
[1:09:19] spiritual man she's born spiritual she's
[1:09:25] born with this gift it's in her life
[1:09:29] praise the Lord
[1:09:32] we're branches just from a little girl
[1:09:34] she likes to play with Dora you know why
[1:09:37] she likes to feed them she likes to
[1:09:38] bathe him there was something in her
[1:09:41] that is just about life boys likes
[1:09:46] playing with car your accident they like
[1:09:49] to see accident Bill Haas break it down
[1:09:52] but in her there was something about
[1:09:54] life praise the Lord
[1:09:57] a man is given to her
[1:10:04] now we look at these women we just
[1:10:06] talked about
[1:10:07] Rahab year that they not use her pass to
[1:10:11] destroy her future didn't look back in
[1:10:14] the past she look in the future and and
[1:10:17] god bless her for that because she
[1:10:20] received the messenger believed a token
[1:10:22] message and she was able to go on not
[1:10:25] even Noreen just like what Ruth did the
[1:10:28] same thing play out in the life of Ruth
[1:10:30] their praise the lord she's you know he
[1:10:35] said to her mother in Lord your God
[1:10:38] would be my god
[1:10:39] your people will be my people not even
[1:10:42] knowing what was waiting for her but yet
[1:10:45] God bring her to marry Boris the kinsman
[1:10:49] redeemer God playing out this plan of
[1:10:53] redemption you know and there was what
[1:10:55] Adam heard when God said you know you
[1:10:59] will bring for life he says no I will
[1:11:04] call her Eve the mother of all living
[1:11:08] Adam was speaking out of prophecy he was
[1:11:12] not only looking at the natural birth he
[1:11:15] was looking at the promise remember God
[1:11:18] has already told a woman from his herd a
[1:11:21] woman see that a woman see would bruise
[1:11:24] the head of the seven so Adam was
[1:11:28] looking at what would play out in the
[1:11:30] future how it would be the woman to be
[1:11:33] able to it was Sarah that gives Abraham
[1:11:36] the promised seed in and true that the
[1:11:39] Patriot come and God was able to run out
[1:11:42] his his his bloodline through the Jews
[1:11:45] and on and on and on and on and see how
[1:11:48] out of this Gentile women came also into
[1:11:51] the promise she's the mother of all
[1:11:53] living
[1:11:54] she's born like that she's born gifted
[1:11:58] but Branham says by nature she's able to
[1:12:01] do many things good she can multitask
[1:12:06] that's the way she's built is a gift
[1:12:09] Oh
[1:12:13] and we know from the scripture right
[1:12:16] from Genesis that's the reason why the
[1:12:19] devil did not go after Adam he went
[1:12:22] after it because he knew she had a gift
[1:12:24] if the devil can be able to destroy that
[1:12:27] gift if he can might that gift you know
[1:12:29] what he want to do brother Branham says
[1:12:31] if he can destroy the confidence in the
[1:12:33] word he can get the believer if he can
[1:12:37] be able to destroy the gift he I mean or
[1:12:41] mother gift they will put you to the
[1:12:44] place word just like Paul that's why
[1:12:47] Paul had to live the way he live because
[1:12:51] there was something that was always in
[1:12:53] his subconscious when he remembered
[1:12:56] witnessing Steven death and witnessing
[1:12:58] the death of all the other believers
[1:13:00] that they will trap him to that place
[1:13:04] every time he remember a weakness him so
[1:13:07] he had to put more into the kingdom of
[1:13:10] God because she had a gift that's what
[1:13:14] the devil went after her and what was
[1:13:20] the I gave Redemption Redemption we see
[1:13:28] this the same type out there in Hana
[1:13:34] Hana the Bible says every year they
[1:13:39] would go out to the temple and it would
[1:13:44] go to the feast the when years after
[1:13:47] years she would go with her maid and the
[1:13:49] children as a young woman she started to
[1:13:53] design Lord you know give me my child
[1:13:56] she was believing you know the husband
[1:14:00] to her a Hannah and I always give you a
[1:14:02] water potion you know I love you to
[1:14:05] death that's that's that's that's good
[1:14:07] that was good enough for her but we will
[1:14:09] realize that Israel were also at a time
[1:14:12] where there was setting value all the
[1:14:17] covering of Jehovah that the church was
[1:14:19] losing Eli was here his sons robbery
[1:14:22] were all in a tabernacle
[1:14:25] she go and see all of these things and
[1:14:28] the Bible says they are there they are
[1:14:29] dragging the daughters of Israel into
[1:14:31] also some things she's seen the disorder
[1:14:33] in the house of God and I mean all of
[1:14:37] there she goes so birding and said God
[1:14:39] if you give me a son I would give him
[1:14:42] back to you well now she did not want to
[1:14:46] want a child for her own but she wanted
[1:14:49] a son somebody that can be able to stand
[1:14:52] up and change the course of Israel
[1:14:56] so you see her birding went beyond
[1:15:00] herself she was not only being selfish
[1:15:03] and just needing for herself but she saw
[1:15:06] the need in the house of God she saw the
[1:15:10] need in Israel all the Bible says it was
[1:15:15] such a time were every man eyes every
[1:15:18] man ways was good in their own eyes
[1:15:22] there was no open vision the people were
[1:15:27] not hearing directly from the Lord
[1:15:29] ela and his boys I mean they were just
[1:15:31] doing whatever that pleases them they
[1:15:34] were taking the things of the Holy of
[1:15:37] the sacrifice and and I mean it was just
[1:15:39] they were just fooling around and every
[1:15:41] time she goes down there
[1:15:43] her heart is broken in oh she's crying
[1:15:46] what are we in all jehovah where is your
[1:15:49] promise we heard how your presence move
[1:15:53] them on our people God if you give me
[1:15:55] the son and we give him back to you in
[1:15:58] another sense she was saying raise up a
[1:16:00] man that would bring us back to the Word
[1:16:04] of God that will bring us back to the
[1:16:07] things of God the mother of all lady she
[1:16:10] wanted to see God living among his
[1:16:13] people again she wanted to see all the
[1:16:15] back in the house of God she wanted to
[1:16:18] go to a church where she can see the
[1:16:20] presence of God praise the Lord she
[1:16:25] wanted for God to live among his people
[1:16:28] that's the mother of all living her
[1:16:31] desire was not just for herself cause
[1:16:34] the her desire was for the house of
[1:16:36] Israel
[1:16:39] and little Samia was born and a gift
[1:16:43] returned back to the church open vision
[1:16:45] started to come back to the church
[1:16:47] once again the man of God can hear
[1:16:49] directly from God God started to speak
[1:16:52] to that young man even from a young age
[1:16:55] because his mother desire was for the
[1:16:58] house of Israel she wanted the Word of
[1:17:03] God to live among the people once again
[1:17:06] praise the Lord
[1:17:07] if you give me a try I would give him
[1:17:10] back to you
[1:17:12] amen that's the model that's a mother's
[1:17:15] desire he mean there's a mother's desire
[1:17:19] she wanted to see God back in the mists
[1:17:21] of the people she started seeing or tire
[1:17:24] seeing all the things that were
[1:17:25] happening you know in the church in
[1:17:28] Israel all the dis order and once again
[1:17:31] God rose up a prophet rose up a prophet
[1:17:37] they were now annoyed a king
[1:17:41] praise the Lord you know the scripture
[1:17:45] in the book of Corinthians Paul came in
[1:17:48] he says if a believing woman choose to
[1:17:58] live with her unbelieving husband the
[1:18:01] both way he says it but you know the
[1:18:05] Bible is so wonderful I was thinking
[1:18:08] about that this morning as I was
[1:18:09] meditating this you know asking the Lord
[1:18:11] and just throwing my mind through the
[1:18:13] scripture I think some I think about
[1:18:15] Abigail this is the time of David praise
[1:18:19] the Lord
[1:18:19] Debbie is so Johnny he's a fugitive he's
[1:18:22] running all over the place
[1:18:24] Abigail the love of her father my
[1:18:29] goodness he made the love of her father
[1:18:34] well yes she had a husband that was rich
[1:18:39] like laude sure arrogant disrespectful
[1:18:45] he was just caught up in his wealth and
[1:18:48] the Bible called him a food
[1:18:50] but you see she knew the weakness of her
[1:18:54] husband but she has such a gift not to
[1:18:58] despise him what she did she's - in the
[1:19:01] bridge she was a woman who gives
[1:19:05] Centrify her husband because David was
[1:19:07] going to cut that guy head off he says
[1:19:11] we are in the field and have my man in
[1:19:12] the field protecting your chips and then
[1:19:16] you cast him in davie oh he was not
[1:19:19] ready - but Abigail ran before him ran
[1:19:23] before her husband
[1:19:25] she fell down before David and oh my
[1:19:29] lord
[1:19:30] then Matt don't put blood on your hands
[1:19:35] because this man is so caught up with
[1:19:37] this last day spirit he's reached blind
[1:19:43] don't put blood on your hands what she
[1:19:47] was doing she was using her garlic
[1:19:49] character that's what Peter said if a
[1:19:52] man does not believe he can be went over
[1:19:55] by the conversation of his wife which
[1:19:57] mean that word conversation means the
[1:19:59] behavior so the behavior of Abigail kept
[1:20:06] giving hints in Ewa cabinet I never kept
[1:20:11] her husband from dying
[1:20:12] it kept their hands from from from from
[1:20:15] from blood because God took his life
[1:20:18] after and what did God do God reward her
[1:20:23] to be your wife - David so she she was
[1:20:29] holding a mystery living in a loud issue
[1:20:33] is reach for aplenty she was in the
[1:20:38] house of a wealthy man but yes she knew
[1:20:41] her mind was thinking about David
[1:20:43] she knew that David was coming to be
[1:20:45] king she knew there was something about
[1:20:48] this man David when everybody ran
[1:20:51] through the street and said David care
[1:20:53] I saw a thousand defecate ten thousand
[1:20:57] what was happening the people knew that
[1:20:59] God was risen up
[1:21:00] man that was going to defending even
[1:21:05] though he had not come to power yet but
[1:21:07] people knew because Goliath was a terror
[1:21:10] to Israel even the King Saul I mean he
[1:21:15] was he was hiding in its own shadows and
[1:21:18] they were stood up just in the time of
[1:21:21] need so they all knew even Germantown
[1:21:26] saw son knew there was something special
[1:21:28] this man was born to be a deliverer of
[1:21:31] Israel so they respected him so even
[1:21:35] though she was in a her rich husband
[1:21:38] house a type of loudest church but she
[1:21:42] knew there was a coming king she knew
[1:21:45] that we had to respect him even though
[1:21:48] he's not empowered yet but he is our
[1:21:51] coming King praise the Lord
[1:21:54] she ran right there and she saved daring
[1:21:57] hands from defining his hands with blood
[1:22:00] he pleased the Lord and God rewarded her
[1:22:04] she was a mother of all living
[1:22:07] she never won a for David to spin his
[1:22:10] hand with blood and she was also saving
[1:22:12] the life of her husband let God be the
[1:22:15] judge he may praise the Lord it means
[1:22:20] she never left him and said well he's a
[1:22:22] fool I'm going to divorce him he's not
[1:22:24] golly you know he don't have the holy
[1:22:25] God no she's still right there
[1:22:29] love of her father she stayed right
[1:22:32] there she's a tide of the end time Brian
[1:22:35] amen oh mine I mean we can just go on
[1:22:40] this morning the mother of all living
[1:22:43] they are living all through the
[1:22:44] scripture their characters are living
[1:22:47] characters praise the Lord
[1:22:51] a living character because they were
[1:22:54] speaking about this endtime bride
[1:22:56] oh we can talk
[1:23:01] the shimmy not woman I mean we can talk
[1:23:03] about the one that had to bring all the
[1:23:05] vessels in and I mean and fill them with
[1:23:09] Arden and like like Paul says time will
[1:23:11] not allow us we can go through all the
[1:23:14] different types in the scripture all of
[1:23:16] these women they were all pointing to
[1:23:19] the coming bride praise the Lord
[1:23:26] you see the difference there between the
[1:23:30] Abigail and Michele amen the one that
[1:23:40] saw David returning back
[1:23:43] praise the Lord I mean she was so
[1:23:46] concerned about her pride and and and
[1:23:49] and her dignity that when David was
[1:23:51] coming before the ark she despised him
[1:23:53] and what God did god make that church to
[1:23:57] be a barren church because she despised
[1:23:59] the word realizing that it was not David
[1:24:03] that was coming it was the act that was
[1:24:04] coming
[1:24:05] David was rejoicing because the word was
[1:24:08] coming and she missed honors to death
[1:24:12] praise the Lord you know just like
[1:24:14] people when somebody is rejoicing over
[1:24:16] the world Laurie Alleluia they just love
[1:24:18] dancing why are you making noise for
[1:24:19] you're not despising that person you are
[1:24:21] despising the word because the person is
[1:24:24] rejoicing because the word is coming and
[1:24:29] whenever you despise the word you I mean
[1:24:31] there is no way you can be able to bring
[1:24:33] for the world when you despise the world
[1:24:36] praise the Lord
[1:24:38] you know so God go seal her womb because
[1:24:43] it is past the word amen so we see over
[1:24:47] and over out of this tide the mother of
[1:24:52] all living
[1:24:53] she was to bring foreign and in all the
[1:24:57] ages
[1:24:58] you know God use Jocko bed if she was
[1:25:01] not there to take that decision Israel
[1:25:04] we're not going to have a deliverer
[1:25:05] there was not going to be the first
[1:25:08] Exeter prophet so she made the promise
[1:25:13] of God the promise that
[1:25:15] or give to ever ham she made that
[1:25:17] promise to leave Syria had to be there
[1:25:22] to make the promise that God gave to
[1:25:24] Abraham to live that's what making her
[1:25:30] the mother of all living
[1:25:32] the church is here for me Christ
[1:25:34] promised to live to bring the promises
[1:25:39] on to field we will lay our hands on the
[1:25:42] sick and the sick will recover that's
[1:25:45] the promise of God there will be a
[1:25:48] people that is ready for the rapture
[1:25:52] there will be a church with a sport or
[1:25:55] that's the promise of God that there
[1:25:57] will have to be people on earth embody
[1:26:00] with the promise of God that we have to
[1:26:03] be a people on earth that will not taste
[1:26:05] death
[1:26:06] praise the Lord Oh mind we are if we
[1:26:10] believe that we are there people don't
[1:26:12] be afraid of coronavirus amen
[1:26:14] it does not have enough because we have
[1:26:18] a promise not to taste death the
[1:26:21] different things that we might go
[1:26:23] through we reflect our body but death
[1:26:25] can I guess through our blood amen
[1:26:29] praise the Lord that is a promise the
[1:26:32] mother of all living
[1:26:34] whenever we see that the promise of
[1:26:38] redemption we look at the church there
[1:26:42] was the attitude of the first Adam then
[1:26:44] we can come down to this woman Mary the
[1:26:49] Jewish church has gone through many
[1:26:51] years without a prophet but Isaiah has
[1:26:56] prophesied that a virgin shackles Eve
[1:27:00] praise the Lord
[1:27:04] never in
[1:27:05] history now see Mary here is going to
[1:27:09] fulfill what God wanted to do in Eve but
[1:27:13] God could not do that without displaying
[1:27:16] his attributes Eve was supposed to bring
[1:27:21] sounds by the spoken word praise the
[1:27:28] Lord
[1:27:30] but if she was going to bring songs by
[1:27:33] the spoken word we will not know the
[1:27:35] other attributes of God so you see the
[1:27:42] sacred trust that God gave Eve the
[1:27:47] sacred trust because of redemption
[1:27:50] that's the reason why is it's more
[1:27:54] spiritual unto the church
[1:27:57] that's what Berta Branham says here he
[1:27:59] says now he says I'm speaking them
[1:28:02] bringing this to an illustration to show
[1:28:05] you where the church things I'm not
[1:28:08] speaking of you women whatever you are
[1:28:11] does between you and God or you men but
[1:28:13] I'm speaking to the church in Christ
[1:28:16] now the this she's giving to bring for
[1:28:20] life that only God Himself can give only
[1:28:27] God Himself can give and what is that
[1:28:30] life is the life of Jesus Christ
[1:28:33] it's a spiritual life now only God
[1:28:37] Himself can give so you see that's the
[1:28:43] reason why a person can have a person
[1:28:45] comes from the world and all of that
[1:28:47] when when they see the plan of
[1:28:49] redemption God is able to restore their
[1:28:54] life God is able to make them like a
[1:28:58] Rahab bring them out of Jerry call bring
[1:29:02] them from out of the bypass and put them
[1:29:05] into a future that they can never look
[1:29:07] back in the past and their spiritual
[1:29:14] sacrifice you in her that you can see
[1:29:17] her and you can never even tell
[1:29:19] she ever that she ever was in Jericho
[1:29:22] you remembered Joshua doing rehab
[1:29:26] wedding and he says is there anybody
[1:29:31] here has any reason why this man and
[1:29:34] this woman should not be married praise
[1:29:39] the Lord Amen the only people that went
[1:29:43] down to Jericho were the two spies amen
[1:29:47] praise the Lord
[1:29:49] there was nobody of her pod that was in
[1:29:52] that wedding because everybody in
[1:29:53] Jericho died the service that I mean the
[1:29:57] entire city was was was destroyed so she
[1:30:03] did not have to look back
[1:30:05] she knew what happened she knew it was
[1:30:08] sooner she and her family another
[1:30:11] talking message that came out she did
[1:30:13] not have to look back during the wedding
[1:30:15] because she knew her past was destroyed
[1:30:20] praise the Lord
[1:30:22] but yera said God will now find a young
[1:30:25] woman engaged to a man then all the
[1:30:36] things that is women play out through
[1:30:39] the ages
[1:30:40] Rahab roof and all these women oh my god
[1:30:46] how can I leave
[1:30:47] Esther out praise the Lord and not a
[1:30:51] character if I die let me die amen she
[1:31:00] was it she was ready to go before the
[1:31:02] king when it was not even time for her
[1:31:06] to go what does she feel it on the field
[1:31:08] later on that she was ready to go lay
[1:31:10] yourself down because of her people she
[1:31:14] she too was carrying a mystery praise
[1:31:19] the Lord
[1:31:20] she too was carrying a mystery even in a
[1:31:23] time when everything was good and Haman
[1:31:30] has not rise to the scene to start
[1:31:32] having hit
[1:31:33] for the Jews but God knew who that would
[1:31:35] be their God knew the hatred will have
[1:31:39] raising in his heart why if there was
[1:31:42] not an Esther on the truth why if there
[1:31:46] was not an Esther to intercede so God
[1:31:48] knows was going to happy in the future
[1:31:50] and now he's giving us the opportunity
[1:31:52] or to feel our self with the world he's
[1:31:55] giving us the opportunity to stay in
[1:31:57] your home pray listening to the tape
[1:31:59] prepare yourself whatever is coming is
[1:32:01] going to come anyway as to have the
[1:32:08] opportunity encouraged by her uncle
[1:32:10] Mordecai to go and be among those women
[1:32:14] being a Jewish girl God favored her just
[1:32:20] so she can be in the right place at the
[1:32:22] right time
[1:32:24] praise the Lord oh I don't I don't
[1:32:28] believe it was just all because of her
[1:32:30] natural beauty it was because God
[1:32:33] favored her for her to be in the right
[1:32:35] place at the right time
[1:32:37] I mean so we see he give us the three
[1:32:47] sacra virtue years spiritually the word
[1:32:50] prayer and the life just running that in
[1:32:54] my mind I'm saying Oh God where is the
[1:32:56] tear one it means so we see here that
[1:33:01] Mary got a young woman just like you
[1:33:06] know well all the other young women in
[1:33:09] Israel for all everything that is women
[1:33:14] are playing our true through the
[1:33:19] scripture go to Eve the seed of the
[1:33:23] woman will bruise the head of the
[1:33:26] serpent can you imagine Adam just
[1:33:29] standing there listening to God talking
[1:33:31] to Eve I will put an ammeter between
[1:33:35] your seat talking to the sepal and a
[1:33:37] woman see why the woman see what God

[1:34:07] them in sheepskin got the next verse
[1:34:11] that comes after there he wrapped him in
[1:34:14] sheepskin and I can imagine Adam holding
[1:34:18] his white hand as a walking out of Eden
[1:34:21] with the ship's came flopping on their
[1:34:25] legs and the blood dropping he turned to
[1:34:28] her say you be the mother of all living

[1:34:44] of all living

[1:35:08] heart with enough room to forgave praise
[1:35:12] the Lord I mean he was just walking down
[1:35:14] there he was thinking more on the
[1:35:17] promise of God and thinking on what the
[1:35:19] second day to Eve he was thinking on
[1:35:22] what God have just said the woman will
[1:35:25] have a seed that would bruise the head
[1:35:27] of the serpent he was thinking on there
[1:35:29] more he would be the mother of all

[1:36:31] and telling bourbon you preach about it
[1:36:33] but you don't know nothing about it
[1:36:35] I think yes that's what that's what each
[1:36:40] item was thinking in his mind as they
[1:36:42] were walking oh my goodness oh honey I
[1:36:59] love you I love you more than I did
[1:37:07] because God just spoke about you
[1:37:13] yes Mary like Bertram says out there
[1:37:16] fetching water then angel appeared to
[1:37:19] her and she said this was be it on to me
[1:37:26] I call him to your word praise the Lord
[1:37:34] submitting herself to the word accepting
[1:37:38] what the angel is saying to her not even
[1:37:43] knowing that the next day her name is
[1:37:49] going to be in the Jerusalem page
[1:37:56] because
[1:37:57] except in that word her good friends
[1:38:00] going to walk away from her her high
[1:38:04] school friends when I want to identify
[1:38:08] with her because she carrying the
[1:38:11] promise I'm going to keep myself I'm
[1:38:17] living for God she's not ashamed to say
[1:38:19] that she's carrying that promise when
[1:38:24] she said be it on to me that call into
[1:38:26] your word even some of her family
[1:38:30] members they're going to say all sorts
[1:38:31] of things about her but it was a coming
[1:38:40] of the woman seed it was the coming of
[1:38:46] the woman see she was going to have a
[1:38:47] seed without mains interference
[1:38:56] illiterate type of how we received the
[1:39:00] Spirit of God in our life it does not
[1:39:03] come through an organization it does not
[1:39:05] come to a church it does not come
[1:39:07] through a man jesus said he he came unto
[1:39:11] his own I mean John testified that he
[1:39:14] came unto his own his own received him
[1:39:16] neighbor as many that I receive him he
[1:39:18] has given him the power to become the
[1:39:20] sons of God now born of the flesh not
[1:39:23] born of the will of man but a birth from
[1:39:27] God this last this church is just like
[1:39:32] miracle we receive a life in us that
[1:39:38] will not come about an organization it
[1:39:42] will not come about a system is the life
[1:39:47] of God Paul says you know he says we we
[1:39:55] are born of I mean the mother Jerusalem
[1:39:58] that's how he types the bride and God
[1:40:04] has given us these sacrificio
[1:40:08] that the church needs to guide I mean we
[1:40:16] need to feel ourselves with the word we
[1:40:19] need to always have you know an
[1:40:22] atmosphere of praying because that's the
[1:40:24] thing that is going to bring the world
[1:40:26] to life that's what we are caught oh
[1:40:30] that is our our I mean in such a time
[1:40:34] where the word is having no hope I mean
[1:40:38] hopeless and things that are happening
[1:40:39] around the world I mean we supposed to
[1:40:42] bring life life of encouragement that's
[1:40:53] what we have been raised up for that's
[1:40:56] why we've been taught out of these years
[1:40:58] a people that is not just associated to
[1:41:04] a church but it's bringing forth the
[1:41:09] very life of Christ that's the reason
[1:41:14] why every time we hear the word we says
[1:41:16] be it unto me according to your word
[1:41:22] Lord I know I'm not there yet but one
[1:41:26] thing's for certain I know I'm not what
[1:41:27] I used to be this is the mother of all
[1:41:36] living
[1:41:37] just like all of those women through the
[1:41:40] scripture can you imagine now being
[1:41:45] going back and not knowing how she will
[1:41:49] be able to get all her inheritance she
[1:41:54] has lost everything because she don't
[1:41:55] have a man to redeem it her songs I did
[1:42:01] her husband is dead
[1:42:05] she's going to go back to her own land
[1:42:08] in her own house and she's going to be
[1:42:10] squatting with someone because honor the
[1:42:13] Lord of Israel one of her husband
[1:42:16] brothers has a right to claim his
[1:42:18] brothers property
[1:42:20] and if he's nice to her he would just
[1:42:24] say well I mean just just get a little
[1:42:26] tame down there or you go and live in
[1:42:28] the shed but there was a woman a gentle
[1:42:32] woman your God would be my god your
[1:42:35] people would be my people
[1:42:36] she stepped out there if you are going
[1:42:41] to I mean if they were a treat you they
[1:42:43] will have to err treat me they got back
[1:42:46] there in the landing she was not a
[1:42:48] friend she took her basket she went down
[1:42:50] to the field they're all looking at her
[1:42:53] she get earrings hanging down or years
[1:42:55] is it what kind of mobile woman is this
[1:42:57] and you know she's not dressing right
[1:42:59] but she's in the field in a way she's
[1:43:01] looking at the girl she says oh yeah the
[1:43:03] dress different year oh yeah you know
[1:43:05] well and she go home she asks her
[1:43:08] mother-in-law Dean and then she's
[1:43:09] learning all of these things from the
[1:43:10] scripture the next day she tried to
[1:43:12] dress like them but I mean I mean she's
[1:43:15] just doing the best that she knows until
[1:43:18] the eyes of all fell on her amen and
[1:43:21] that's the same thing we do I mean we
[1:43:23] give our self to the world we do our
[1:43:25] best until the eyes of our bones can
[1:43:27] fall on us and when when and when the
[1:43:30] eyes of our boy was following us in the
[1:43:32] form of the Holy Spirit it changed your
[1:43:34] life forever
[1:43:35] when boy's eyes fell on her roof was no
[1:43:38] longer the same Amy and I believe he
[1:43:40] said he sent royal dresses for her to
[1:43:43] where she could put away all of those
[1:43:46] MOBOT skirts and mobile trousers and
[1:43:48] mobile on clean dress and now she's
[1:43:50] dressing like a princess because the
[1:43:53] eyes are boys for on her but while she
[1:43:58] was saying there why why to give life to
[1:44:01] Nami to restore everything that Naomi
[1:44:05] lost all her lane or her husband
[1:44:09] property because now her daughter has
[1:44:12] married a man boys that can stand up for
[1:44:15] the family and be able to redeem
[1:44:17] everything now once again now me would
[1:44:24] not have a voice she says
[1:44:31] Ruth you're better to me than seven sons
[1:44:35] I have only two but you have brought so
[1:44:40] much joy to me I feel like I had ten
[1:44:46] sons just your action just your support
[1:44:51] just your commitment to the word Hobart
[1:44:58] brand and play her there you I mean root
[1:45:01] seven root in sacrifice root being
[1:45:05] reward I mean she was growing out of all
[1:45:08] through those things the mother of all
[1:45:11] living
[1:45:12] she brought life to now me once again
[1:45:17] now making come on her porch and she can
[1:45:19] sing the song of Zion
[1:45:21] she don't have to hang her head down
[1:45:23] because she had a daughter that's two
[1:45:26] with her and that's how this endtime
[1:45:31] bride is all they can say what they want
[1:45:34] to say praise the Lord but God has given
[1:45:37] us a revelation of what this message is
[1:45:41] amen he has given us a revelation of the
[1:45:44] aim time messenger that the message is
[1:45:47] not about a man and if it's about a man
[1:45:50] it's about a man Jesus Christ amen

[1:46:28] meditation I mean LEDs are telling her
[1:46:32] all of this and I mean she just
[1:46:33] swallowing it I mean she's feeding on it

[1:49:11] Ghost is able to feel the vol we can
[1:49:15] have joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:49:23] they can just be something in our heart
[1:49:26] that we are ready to face another day no
[1:49:32] matter how the Trier is high this church
[1:49:36] is the mother of all living
[1:49:38] why because we're going to bring the
[1:49:43] death scenes back to life
[1:49:45] they've been waiting on us we are the
[1:49:48] Church of the Resurrection the mother of
[1:49:51] all living
[1:49:52] and then when those their sins comes up
[1:49:55] we step on the other side Nevermore to
[1:49:57] die amen
[1:50:00] this is the church the mother of all
[1:50:03] living
[1:50:04] when the death scenes comes and we get
[1:50:06] in the rapture death is its lock out we
[1:50:10] don't have to think about it we don't
[1:50:11] have to talk about it because death is
[1:50:14] going to be no more praise the Lord
[1:50:18] forever we live with with the king we
[1:50:20] live with our Lord the one that we love
[1:50:22] the one that will be we've been waiting
[1:50:24] for we've been looking forward to so we
[1:50:28] see all these women in the scripture God
[1:50:31] had a mystery in your life that we can
[1:50:36] look at them and know that they've been
[1:50:38] speaking about us this endtime Brian
[1:50:45] you know I was sitting on on on the
[1:50:51] iniquity of the amorite and I came
[1:50:53] across what brother Branham was talking
[1:50:55] about the mystery of iniquity and the
[1:50:58] mystery of godliness he since the
[1:51:01] mystery of godliness is the church is
[1:51:03] the bride she's holding the mystery of
[1:51:07] godliness and the mystery of iniquity he
[1:51:14] says is that other church we were
[1:51:17] talking about there let me not start
[1:51:19] another message here but I want to wish
[1:51:23] you a Happy Mother's Day and all that
[1:51:28] God give us the greatest gift when he
[1:51:31] gives us mothers praise the Lord
[1:51:35] many will talk about their mother how
[1:51:38] she will go hungry and make sure that
[1:51:40] how young ones have food to eat no
[1:51:46] matter how wicked and evil H is H is
[1:51:50] never evil to their mother when a mother
[1:51:55] thinks about her try called my wrongs
[1:51:58] back to that day in the hospital when
[1:52:02] she heard the breath of life in her hand
[1:52:04] she goes back to that moment and that is
[1:52:11] the same way with the church we value
[1:52:14] the Holy Ghost because we know without
[1:52:17] him we can have life there is no way we
[1:52:19] can live out this life that's the reason
[1:52:22] why we always remember the experiences
[1:52:25] we have with God we remember in our
[1:52:28] tough time we go back to those
[1:52:30] experiences because those were
[1:52:33] life-changing women it was life-changing
[1:52:37] moment when a mother goes through nine
[1:52:41] months and she hold our baby in her arm
[1:52:43] it's life-changing
[1:52:45] and that's the same with the baptism of
[1:52:48] the Holy Ghost
[1:52:49] is with the church it's a life-changing
[1:52:53] moment your life will never be the same
[1:52:55] don't be afraid of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:59] because that's what you need to be able
[1:53:01] to live this life of Christ that's the
[1:53:04] that's what you need to be able to stand
[1:53:06] for God in your generation when Paul
[1:53:10] says I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:53:12] Jesus Christ
[1:53:13] it takes the Holy Ghost for you to say
[1:53:15] the same thing that you are not ashamed
[1:53:18] of Jesus Christ you are not a team of
[1:53:20] the message of the hour you are not
[1:53:22] ashamed to be called a Christian you are
[1:53:26] not ashamed you know to tell people you
[1:53:29] don't have a boyfriend don't be a shame
[1:53:30] of faith amen
[1:53:34] don't be ashamed to tell them young
[1:53:37] people that the first gear I'll catch
[1:53:41] you will be my wife or the first board
[1:53:43] our kids it will be before the altar
[1:53:45] don't be ashamed to say it but I will
[1:53:48] tell you you need the Holy Ghost to have
[1:53:50] that confession
[1:53:52] you will need the life of Christ in you
[1:53:55] or s is just a mental conception praise
[1:53:59] the Lord
[1:54:00] so I once again I say happy Mother's Day
[1:54:02] let's bow our heads and pray amen
[1:54:17] oh what a gift of life what a gift of
[1:54:22] life how God can take a person from a
[1:54:30] wisp pass and take the person from a
[1:54:32] path that is so horrible and he can just
[1:54:36] bring a beauty out of them it's all
[1:54:41] because of the gift of life the mother
[1:54:59] of all living
[1:55:00] that's a curvature that God gave to the
[1:55:02] church he can take us from our paths and
[1:55:06] and the different things that we have
[1:55:10] gone through and bring us to the place
[1:55:12] to so fall in love with Jesus
