[Music] [Music] what is the message of this church what should this church teach what's his message the first message i can think of that this church mystical body will teach will be repentance let's turn to luke 24 again just for a moment luke 24th chapter the first thing the church is to do is to repent and it will teach repentance now jesus fixing the lead this is the last chapter when he's fixing to leave the earth luke 24 46 let's begin with the 46th verse and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoove christ to suffer and arise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins well i want that to soak in because i'm coming to you something in a minute on that remission of sins repentance towards god and remitting of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things suffer said the scriptures he's the one the prophet spoke of he's the one the whole bible turned around uh involved around him surely he didn't know what ought to be taught he didn't know what ought to be done and he said repentance and remission of sins must be preached to all nations for a witness beginning at jerusalem amen now organization begin at rome organization church begin at rome come on to germany for martin luther on to england for wesley on to the united states for john smith california for pentecost but the church begin at jerusalem repentance towards god and the baptism in the name of jesus christ for a remission of sins begin at jerusalem and should should he said didn't said it all reach it it should begin it should go to all the world it should be preached but there's very little of it but that's what he said its message that's the message of the church show me the church's teaching tell me where it's at you don't find me now jesus is king the second message jesus is king and is alive forevermore matthew 28 20 jesus is king and alive forever that's what the church should teach matthew 28 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world is that right hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the message of the church doing his work proving his resurrection and giving witnesses now acts 5 32 where we see whether they had it or not as returned acts fifth chapter 32nd verse and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god has given to them that obey him he's got to be witness john 14 12 he gives a teaching what the church should do in john the 14th chapter the and the 12th verse we'll see what that says john 14 12. so we read it make it official all right john 14 and the 12th first verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these do he do because i go to my father that's the message of the church jesus christ the same yesterday forever living in the church king of the church raised from the dead same yesterday and forever performing the same works doing the same things that jesus did that's the message of the church if the church isn't teaching that he's teaching some false theology amen that's why jesus commanded him to preach what else will be how we know whether these people they say well i'm a believer let's see what his last commission was to his church for believers mark 16. take mark the 16th chapter and we'll find out what his last message was to the church and we'll see then whether we're following out his commission mark 16 let's begin the 14th verse after he appeared unto the eleven that's after his resurrection as they sat at me here's the commission to the church now listen the last commission will check ourselves whether we're believers or were we in this church or not after he appeared unto the leaven as he said it meet and afraid to them with the hardness of their heart without their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after his resurrect after he was risen somebody had seen him somebody was trying to tell him about it and they did not believe it if that isn't the same thing today we know he lives we have the witness of his spirit in us we see his power move over the audiences and tens of thousands of people and discern their thoughts thoughts and hearts just exactly like he did when he was shared like the bible said the word of god if he is the word of god in the beginning was the word award is with god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the word of god is sharper more powerful than a two-aged sword cutting even to the mirror the bone and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart christ the works that i do shall you also see him doing that how many seen him do it am i sure we know he does it he lives here he's in our hearts they don't believe it they didn't believe it then they don't believe it now they believe he died and that settled we got a some kind of a historical thing that some fellow raised up a few years ago and established the church and wrote a catechism and that's what we hold on to that's pagan amen right no truth to that oh i don't say truth the man might have done it man might have been ever so sincere but god doesn't control his church like that he never did want it when they asked for a king samuel called him and said this he said i want to ask you something have i ever failed you have i ever asked you for any of your money have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what was right god don't want you to have a king he wants to be your king he said oh samuel sure you're right you're a good prophet you've never told us nothing but the truth you've never begged us for money them things are true but we want to be like the rest of them we want a king anyhow samuel said it's going to cause your heartaches and troubles it's going to take your sons and daughters he's going to pollute him and the things he'll do he'll do it and he did but still they wanted a king that's way today oh we've got to have some kind of a name attached to us we got to tell the people when they asked us where methodist baptists just say you're christians that's right christ sign after he had risen from the dead they didn't believe it and he said unto them what's the great commission go ye into how much the world or i thought just jerusalem somebody said these signs only went to jerusalem all the world and preached the gospel how many knows what the gospel is not the word paul said the gospel come to us not in word only but through the power and manifestation of the holy ghost the gospel is the power of god to make the word act what it says it'll do amen preach the gospel all the world preach the gospel to just the white people or just the brown yellow black to every creature amen amen every creature amen you believe that means that yeah amen i seen god baffle the bull one day i see him cause hornets not to sting i've seen him raise up a possum have been laying dead all night every creature amen the gospel will take effect upon anything that you ask you say that's wrong brother blame it isn't wrong jesus said to that tree curse it be you no man eat from you from henceforth and the gospel was preached to that tree amen i feel religious right now amen preach it to whatever creature oh we could just had time for these things now he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved oh i believe in baptized fine good all right he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned oh i'm glad i'm a believer wait a minute and as a conjunction tying the sentence together and these signs oh i thought you didn't believe in sign that's jesus own words argue with him these signs shall not they may be sometimes they do they shall follow them that believe praise the lord now we're going to see whether you believe or not go see what your organization believes or not they might say they believe jesus said these signs will follow them that believe that's right why they deny those signs these signs shall follow them and believe how much in my name they shall cast out devils and you that don't believe in divine healing you churches this is tapes you understand i'm not always talking to you somebody else is going to hear it exclaim that you believe in god and believe in the commission that your church is commissioned to take the gospel the very first thing is divine healing what was the first thing jesus told his disciples when he sent him out matthew 10 1 heal the sick cast on devils what was the last thing he said to his church heal the sick amen calisthenic devils benjamin and reuben first and last he that was which is and shall come the morning star the root and offspring of david hallelujah hallelujah that's him thank you jesus yes sir these signs shall follow them believe in my name they shall cast out devils just as jerusalem to all the world and to every creature is that the bible that's what it said that is the message of the church hallelujah all the world every creature the gospel that everyone that believes these signs shall follow my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues and you poor nazarenes called him a bunch of tongues people you wouldn't even sit in church with him ain't that awful what are you gonna do when you get to heaven jesus died speaking in time they said he spoke and he spoke in another language she sure he did he spoke in hebrew he did not that's not hebrew writing he spoke in a heavenly language when abel offered his lamb on the rock when the little lamb was dying is happening on the neck a type of christ way back in the garden of eden the little lamb bleeding in another language as he was dying it typed as his bloody wool being bathed with his own blood it typed the son of god hanging on wrong calvary chopped to pieces with our sins dying speaking in another language oh my god why has thou forsaken me that's the message of the church they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues thank you lord that's what he said that's the message of the church that's what he command the church to do so cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink a deadly thing it shall not harm them they lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's the commission of the church that's a real believing church is that part of the methodist baptist presbyterian catholic lutheran nazarene no pilgrim holiness no sir they did not glory why they're organized and they can't do it there's a many member in there that believes that but he can't say nothing about it because he'll be excommunicated that's an antichrist spirit god of mauryan the church of the living god is freeborn don't need any domination follow the king of the messianic kingdom they don't have to take the people saying they're pre-born made free by the sun who makes them free indeed these signs shall follow this gospel shall be preached who's going to preach it god's able to take the ignorance god's able to rise up stones to children god can do whatever he wants to do he's god that's the way he does it when he come he never called camphysis he never called one priest he never called one theologian he took fishermen herdsmen and they're ignorant and unlearned the bible said that peter and john were both ignorant and unlearned but he could get down and work through them the kingdom of god and confound the eyes and the minds of the wise almighty they said they're talking if they were injured and unlearned man but had to take heed to them that they had been with jesus why they had his spirit on them they were acting like he acted they were doing the things that these signs shall follow them that believe certainly signs of following now another thing this church will teach will be to find healing the message of the church i just quoted it matthew 10 when he sent his church out let's just go to matthew 10 1 and find out just a minute watch what jesus said when he ordained his church and started out and then he called unto him his twelve disciples and gave them power against unclean spirits to cast out cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of diseases the first commission to his church the last commission go into all the world preach the gospel he that believeth is baptized let me quote it the way it should be the way it's broke down going into all the world into every nation and demonstrate the power of the holy ghost he that leaveth on this and is baptized shall be saved he that denies it will be damned these signs shall follow them that believe they lay hands on the sick they shall recover they'll cast out devils you'll speak with new tongues this will be the signs that follows the last verse said and they return the lord working with them confirming his word with signs following that's the way the first church was and listen jesus said i am the vine ye are the branches and if a branch brings forth the vine and that vine bears grapes the next branch comes forth it'll bear just like the first brainstem oh you say brother branham but we look at all these churches that's grafted vines how you can graft citrus fruit you can take an orange tree and put a lemon on it and it'll grow that's what you man grafted in and these organizations is what man grafted in it's a lemon all the time it'll grow because it's stuck out in the church name but let me tell you if that tree ever puts forth another branch itself it'll bear an orange and if the power of god ever puts forth another church it'll be another pentecost and another book of acts will be right behind it because it's a church of god jesus said i'm the vine you're the branches you cannot bear fruit in yourself but i throw my own self into the branch and what kind of fruit did it bear these signs shall follow them that believe the second church rises up the mystical body of christ will have the same signs yet a little while the world seath be no more yet ye shall see me for i will be with you even in you and every branch to the end of the world jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever that's the church of the living god that's who it is yeah that's the kind of witnesses he has now also the church must teach baptism it must be baptized that was a commission jesus said here in mark 16 we'll just use it he that believeth and is baptized believe first and then be baptized for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and the holy ghost will also come upon there will be a teaching of the church where jesus said in luke 24 49 we're right close to it so let's just turn to it just a second the 49th verse here we read that 46-47 look at the 49 and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but carry ye our weight tarry means wait in the city of jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high if christ would not let a bunch of men who would walk with him for three and a half years go preach any gospel or could not preach any gospel until they waited for the holy ghost the church today has to do the same thing wait for the holy ghost amen i was talking to a catholic lady you're not long ago in an organ and she said well you mean to tell me that that bunch of idiots down there where he was preaching and screaming and crying going on like that do you mean that they'll be in a heaven and rule in heaven i said yes ma'am she said well we don't believe in such stuff i said because you don't believe the word of god and she said we believe that mary intercedes for us i said that's absolutely heathen she never was a goddess she's a woman mother of god how could god have a mother hail mary mother of god how could god have a mother she bore the son of god christ jesus no woman is a creator she holds the seat of a man the man's not a creator god creates a life it's just a routine of order that god put to bring children she's no mother of god god can't have a mother because he had no beginning of days or ending of life he's a town she can't be a mother of god now i said what if i tell you that your blessed virgin that you looked you as a goddess what if i tell you that god wouldn't let her come to heaven until she acted like that people did last night [Applause] she said that's not right i said did you tell me the catholic church wrote the bible the apostles and you said they were catholic i defy that there knows no catholic church for 300 years after the death of the last apostle go after the night seeing counsel show me page history anything you want to not your catechism because it don't compare with history that's right there was such a thing but i said that mary the bible said that mary the mother of jesus and the rest of the women with 120 all had to climb those steps to the upper room and be filled with the holy ghost until they staggered like they were drunk speaking in tongues and acting like a bunch of drunkards that's what the bible said i put my finger on the verse and i said read it she said i don't want to read it i'm not supposed to read it i said you're not honest here's where virgin mary received the holy ghost and spoke in tongues and staggered like a drunk one now if you go to heaven you can't go with her because she had to receive the holy ghost and if she had to do that being the mother of jesus christ how much more do you require she said if i had to go to heaven with anything like that i would want to be in heaven i said you don't have much to worry about i don't think you're going anywhere don't think you have much to be bothered about it that's exactly god's spirit now you're a witness to me after the holy ghost has come upon you now what is this now what are we saying what is it who set it up and what is its message now to hurry up to get just a little farther along the fourth thing how do we become a member of it how do we join it we see what it is now what how do we join this church you don't join him that's right you can't join us amen there's no way of joining us you're born into it i've been with the branham family 51 years and never did join the family i was born to branham and you're born a son of god or a daughter of god let us take john the third chapter just a moment and just see what god said here about it how do you get into this church what's the proposition god offers you john the third chapter one day there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jew the same came to jesus by night and said to him rabbi we don't are a teacher come from god no man can do the miracles which thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said to him fairly i say unto thee except the man be born again verily i say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god how do you get into it born into it let's read the question further naked even said unto him how can a man be born when he's old see that carnal a teacher a great man a priest age read the bible all his life can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born now is that like some of these intellectual teachers are here today jesus answered and said unto him very i sent you except the man be born of water how do we get into it of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god lest he be jarned into it you can't be joined into it you got to be barned into it now come and join come and born that which is born to the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit of spirit marvel not as i say unto you you must be born again the wind blow worthlessness thou cannot tell the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it come or whether it goeth so is everyone that's born to the spirit see you don't join it it's a mysterious thing amen you're born into the mystical body of christ that's how you get into it first corinthians 12th chapter let's just go a little further just got a few more i want to try to get it out if i possibly can if you just i know it's hot but let's start here just a minute first corinthians the 12th chapter the 13th verse four by one handshake by one vowel i vow to believe in the great holy roman church come shake my hands put your name on the book buy one letter come by letter you might read that in the old lady's birthday almanac but you don't read it in god's bible yes sir four by one spirit are we all joined recorded baptized into one organization one body which is the body of christ whether we be jews our gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been made all made to drink of one spirit not methodist spirit baptist spirit pentecostal spirit but by one holy spirit we have all been baptized into this fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunged beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains the dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day there they are though as he wash all my sins away one body how do we come into that body how we get into it by one spirit hallelujah we're baptized into one body and when in that body free guarantee of resurrection god placed upon him the iniquity of us all not the one handshake not one church letter but by one holy spirit jew gentile yellow black white have all been baptized by one spirit into that one body to the blood of his own covenant and when i see the blood i'll pass over you and are free from death free from pain free from sin he that's born of god does not commit sin because the seed of god remains in him and he cannot sin praise the lord thank you no sin be therefore perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect jesus said how can you be perfect you can't do it she was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking live but when you accept christ as your sin barrier when you accept him by faith you believe that he saved you and he died in your place and tough your sins then god accepts you and baptizes you into the body and cannot see no more sin how can i be a sinner when there's an atonement on the altar for me how could a policeman rest me in the city when the city ordinances give me rights to run any speed that i want to you cannot rest me if the mayor says reverend branham you're going on sick calls make any speech you want to it any zone gives me a letter of recommendation to that no policeman can take me in because the mayor has put confidence in me that i wouldn't do it less is on emergency and when god accepted me and baptized me at the holy ghost he had confidence in me that i would not sin willfully amen i would not sin wealthy therefore his son made an atonement for me and i cannot be a sinner as long as i'm justified and he's tucked me in his body i'm redeemed with him not what i do but what he did for me that's the last room hallelujah thank you jesus [Music] ephesians [Music] you
