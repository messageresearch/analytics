TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] any denominational doctrines anything in the world it'll say loyal to its mate the word always laurel and by this home-loving conduct by the conduct of its home loving it has been successfully used for a carrier pigeon because it loves home you turn it loose anywhere it'll always go back home it'll go back home we'd like to stress on that a little longer you christians that understand what i mean it always finds its way back home so therefore it's been used for carrier pigeon it's used in time of war used to be they still use them carrier pitches to carry a message so you see then that makes the dove both by god and man a messenger a dove is a messenger it was a messenger to noah to tell noah that there's feasts again it was used by god to vindicate that this was his son the sacrifice to bring peace upon the earth and good will to man it was used as a messenger right here i have a little story in my mind i read one time out of a book now i don't want to say this as sure it may be in the decline of the first world war i'm not positive of that now if you miss seeing it then i'm wrong i either read the books been many years ago but it was certainly a really a dramatic thing that happened the american soldiers was pinned down by german machine gun fire and they were in kind of a pit you soldiers i guess understand how they were on a reconnaissance somewhere and it was pinned down and they had just a little bit of ammunition left and the germans was moving in great units moving in everywhere and they knowed that unless they get some reinforcement some help that they would soon all die they had to the germans coming right down off the mountains looking right down their neck going right into them like that and one of them happened to remember that he had a little mascot a little pigeon so he knew that this pigeon if it could get out of there would carry the message to the main headquarters to where they'd been stationed and so they sat down and wrote on a note we are pinned down in a certain position at a certain area we're out of ammunition a few hours we'll have to surrender or either we'll be massacred and they pin this or tied it on the foot of this little dove and turning loose now he's a home loving bird so he what does he do he takes back home for his feet find his mate she was worried about him he'd have to come back home and as he went up the germans seen what had happened so the thing they'd done they started shooting at the dove and one of them hit him with the 30 caliber machine gun or bullet it broke his leg another torn big hunk out of his back his chest was bruised all the way across one of his wings just crippled the ends shot off of it and he flew sideways but he kept climbing finally he made it crippled wounded broken bruised but he fell in the camp with the message hallelujah that was a great day but oh brother isaiah 53 tells us of one came down from home and all that was good and he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the testament of our peace is upon him and with his stripes we were healed sickness superstition and devils had us pinned down there was no way out the church had gone wrong that went off on denominational things and pharisees sadducees and washing of pots and pans and the word of god become of no effect but this little dog came down and there's only one thing could take place there had to be a redeemer but being wounded broken beaten torn but he knows his way back home so from calvary's cross where they bruised him mashed him tore him like a bunch of wolves upon him he made his flight from calvary then landed in heaven's doors saying it's finished it's finished [Applause] they're free sickness can be healed now sinners can be saved the captain can be set free though he was bruised and wounded that great battle there when even everything against him even the point cried out mid-rendering rocks and darkening skies my savior bowed his head and died but the opening veil revealed the way to heaven's joy and endless days i've been a neurotic all my life as a little boy there was something struck me i'd scare me about every seven years it would happen to me brother jack remembers i first started come off the field for a year something just happened i remember the day that juanita hemphill i think her name's juanita kelly now she married brother kelly after the death of her husband and a gene i've got their pictures and things they were such her them two girls and sister moore had a little trio they sang that song i never forget looking beyond the sunset brother jackie remember i guess coming up from florida what fine little girls i remember that morning a little a pentecostal group from up here in northern part of the country michigan somewhere those girls stood out there with brother hooper and i've seen him here another night i may not be here now brother ed hooper are you here brother ed i don't think he sat here the other night uh knowing many of you know him he and i and brother julie we was leaving and those girls standing at the corner singing that gave us each one a yellow rose that they took out of their hair that's where that maniac had been healed down there great things that took place coming up the road just as happy as i could be all of a sudden it struck me a year later before i entered the field again just kill me that's a little boy i always said i didn't know what a vision was a little boy always said if i if i'd only fall in one of those trance and see that i'd get well that time i always wanted to go to mayo to find out what was wrong dr zarat my stomach is sour and oh my brother jax helped me around the house i walk right around the house and just a hot great greasy water like flying out of my mouth and walk through the pulpit and pray for people just twice that bad and be healed i've had him laying my hands on a man with a cancer on his face the cancer left his face standing there and i said sick i couldn't stand up and you don't know what to suffer gives mental oppression every seven years it's come all my life that's where i'm at now 7 8. so i was i was so distressed i cried i begged i pleaded now i remember when i finally thought i had enough money to go to mails for an examination he said they'll find what your trouble is wife and i and becky back there sarah was a little bitty fella i was just entering my healing ministry and we took off to males i went through the clinic and the night before i find i had my finals the next morning i just woke up and staying on the bed looking around and i looked out in front of me and there was a little boy look just like me about seven years old and looked at it and it was me and it's standing by an old snag tree and on that tree any of you squirrel hunters though you can rub a stick up and down on a tree like that and a scare squirrel and run running out if he's in the holler and i was seen there where that squirrel had been and i thought what kind of squirrel is that and i rubbed it and when i did i looked over it and it was me then about 38 years old the little boy was gone so i rubbed that limb and out of that hollow log pole come a little squirrel about that long dark almost black and look like little uh currents flying from him little bitty beady eyes a wickedest looking thing that i ever seen look like a weasel more than a squirrel and he looked right at me and i opened my mouth and said well and what i did before you could have batted your eye he flew right into my mouth went down into my stomach and just tearing me to pieces and as i come out of the vision with my hands up look at the winter screaming oh god i have mercy it's killing me i heard a voice way down in the room say remember it's only six inches long how many heard that story i've told you that many times the people around heaven well on and on it went suffering just the same mayo brothers the next day exam he said your father was an irishman you dream you're a mother being a half indian that makes you almost a half breed so you be you you're just such a nervous wreck until you'll never be out of it said otherwise you're healthy but that that's something in the soul that man cannot control said you will said when a man dies can hold autopsy because his soul's gone he says we will never get over it and that guy said my old doctor said my father had he died at about 85 90 years old somewhere along there he said it said a month or two before he died i examined him had to all his life he get said spell some people said they get high tempered so that's the kind that'll kill you you said the other kind like women in menopause that cry you got the kindest kind of a weary feeling he said the old timers just called had the blues it wouldn't leave them so when that hitch it your stomach sours you're just upset i said but sir i don't you know i said i'm happy said that's right that's just how the human grab bag said you'll always have it oh what a discouraging thing but the words are thinking remember it's only six inches long that's wrong with me as my dear wife becker can tell you year after year i thought of that and then going overseas this last time i was before well i was back home i was on a squirrel hunting trip i jumped out of the car with brother banks woods who's listening in tonight i started round the hill and looked like my heart would jump out of me i asked dr sam adair i said what does that he said next time you have it get a cartogram it's all right so it happened again the next year and when i took the cartogram and said nothing wrong with your heart and you're just nervous start coming on man well another doctor said to me a good friend of mine said that's your heart boy said you better be careful that's a year i'll call brother moore and he got somebody preaching my stead when i went on that ram hunt with brother fred i go up over mountains just like i did was 16 years old a mile after my running never bothered me a bit i come back told sam he said well there's something wrong you better be careful then i saw a vision of an old doctor standing with those old-fashioned doctor with some steer scopes over his arm he said you stand in front of me one day he said don't let him tell you that's your heart that's your stomach or i thought well i'll just take that word because it was a vision come on i started africa to get some shots i had to take a bunch of shots before going to africa that's the law so when i was getting these shots he said well i can't find one thing wrong with you that your hemoglobin your blood is 96 and 76. said if you're 16 years old it wouldn't be anymore it wouldn't be any better and said hard enough to beat you 100 years lungs everything said you're all right no sugar nothing i said thank you so i got a physical test and and to take my health certificate to the board so uh he said you know anything but i said nothing but persistent souring in the stomach all the time he said well i'll tell you he said uh i said well i've been examined i've been to mayo brothers and everywhere he said but wait a minute he said sometimes the ulcer is so little that that barren meal won't show it and sometimes it's too big to show it because an x-ray is only a shadow a little bitty ulcer you can't see they want enough stick a whole lot of little bitty ulcers could do that he said i know an old doctor up here that's found an instrument they got it now they can put you to sleep with a little sodium and penethol put a tube in your throat and they just actually look down in your stomach and see what's wrong said he said he's your type of people he's a christian he said why don't you go see him i talk his name dr van ravensworth so when i come back i went up to see the old doctor oh he's a fine old man from dutchy cindy's i have a big line of missionaries and he'd hurt him and read my book and oh he just shook my hand he said brother brown i'd be glad to do that for you he said what dude next week you roll up the hospital over here and said and called me up before you go and said i have to give you a little shot of pentothal and said then what did you say to punch your sleep for five minutes my little girl had just tucked it i have a tooth pull and brother norman's little girl at five minutes sleep i thought that won't bother me so i thought i'd be satisfied then to look at it and then the next morning i raised up in the bed i looked around and looked over at the twin bed my wife over there and woke up yet i was looking out the window towards the great catalina mountains there where i lived i looked up there where the angel of the lord put that sword in my hand or the seven angels that you see in the picture appeared great things taking place and i looked and i was look there i was standing by that tree again right where that squirrel was i looked up there i thought that's that squirrel's damn i don't wonder if he's still up there in the vision i raked the side of the tree how'd he come and before i could even back my eye is the oddest looking squirrel i've ever seen now you have to know my ministry to know these symbols he jumped at me but he missed me he missed my mouth hit on my chest and fell off and as soon as he did i heard something said go to the catalina mountains so i turned around i said meaty are you awake honey i woke her up she said what's matter about five o'clock in the morning i said i was looking out here and i saw that squirrel again honey what squirrel i said when i seen up there at mayo's i said you know what he missed my mouth this time he never hit me he went out on my chest i said praise be to god i've looked well since a little boy i have long to see that happen if i could ever see that happen not even before i know what a vision was if i could ever see that happen then i said i'd be all right whatever that told me that's what i'd be and for 40 years i've looked for that and there it happened before when i was at mayo's the same time i was up there when they gave me that message and i saw the vision my old mother's gone on the glory now very odd woman she had about three or four dreams in her life they were always true she'd tell me she started to tell me i i'd say stop right mama tell what the rest of it is because always when you give me a dream to interpret you don't always tell me just exactly what it is then when i see it over again i see exactly what you dreamed about then he tells me what it is see you don't have to tell me what the dream is he shows me the dream himself and then i see i said you didn't tell me this and tell me that see and so the god that can interpret a dream can shoulder him you show honey get interpreted and so then what was he something like that in the bible said if you can i just have to come to me daniel wasn't it no joseph joseph i want somewhere in the bible i just remember that that if you can show me you can tell me what a horse king nebuchadnezzar that's right i said if you can if you can't the magician said tell me the dream he said it's gone from me that's right that i remember that just thought of it then now i notice and mama she said billy when i come back she said come here son and sit down. she said i had a strange dream i dreamed that i've seen you laying sick just about to die with your stomach as usual how many dices she cooked me and she said you were building a house up on a hill and said i've seen six white doves come down from heaven cooting in the letter s and they set up on your chest and you were looking and the one in front was trying to tell you something said these real glossy white doves and they took their little heads and put against your cheek and going cool i said i couldn't understand that it just kept going i said oh i see it praise the lord and said they formed their letter s again and went back up into the skies going going back home well the little animal that i saw was six inches long the string of doves that mom saw were six six is incomplete i knew that someday i'd see that seventh one that was man suffering so on and on it went that morning i got up after seeing this vision i obeyed the lord i took my little boy joseph to school he's listening to me now in tucson i took him to school told me to i didn't want to be back and i took off up in the catalina up into the uh the foothills and i went up into the place where the angel lord put the sword in my hand real early and started climbing up the mountain or instead of going up in the peaks this way which is a lot of snake scarpings you know how arizona is i turned to my right something said turn to your right i went way into the peaks i went around and i was going around those great huge rocks many times bigger than this tabernacle laying up in that tops there were selling ever a person could get along about 11 o'clock i was going into a little cold backwards and a little place turned in like this over a little deer trail and i had my shirt off my hat my hand because i was just lathering with sweat and so i turned in there and as i turned in that little cold i felt the presence of the lord i jerked off my hat looked around oh this year somewhere a noise here oh what is it i made a few more steps i said lord you're here somewhere i looked laying on the path and barely that little squirrel had jumped at something and missed it and it hit a bunch of chauya that's jumping cactus it ran through his head chest stomach and he was dead that odd looking little squirrel he had missed my mouth and hit that chawya and the voice of the lord said your enemy is dead i stood there i trembled i took my foot matt usually crawls and eat it up i killed him snake a couple days later then laid on the road about a half hour there's always eagles and crows flying through there and they'll pick it up right now i killed a coral snake that's the most dangerous snake we got laying right beside i mean a few days after that i started to come back to pick it up for short crows have done got it ravens passing over and that have been laying there ever since i've seen the vision two days before uh it's on saturday night went up on monday so there he was laying on there dead i mashed it with a foot i went back around sit down again sat there and cried a while and prayed looking that over tucson miles blow me turn back around and come back and still lay there when i entered that cold the spirit of god come on me again i went around went down the mountain when i told my wife i said honey i don't know how but i'm going to get over this dr ravensworth when he give me the examination he said it's totally impossible for you to be well he gave me a shot of pentethal that was the last me for five minutes and i slept 10 hours so that stuff and even aspirin just knocks me out so they he gave me a shot put that tube down the throat when i come to you and he told me next morning he said reverend i hate to tell you this but said your stomach walls are even so hard they're dried up i never seen it he used the name of gasteritis and i went and looked in the dictionary and said something has withered away and said you can't get over it he said you'll always have it and i would have been a discouraged boy if it happened for the vision of the lord and the next day something said go back to the mountain and that day instead of going one way i was led to go another way and i was standing there and looking set in front of me and there set that seventh little white doe looking right at me i rubbed my eyes i said sure it's a vision surely it is i look i said little doll where do you come from this is pretty in white could have been a pigeon whatever it was away in that wilderness god almighty who raised up jesus christ from the dead whose servant i am his word laying here open before me know that i tell the truth and lie not there set the dove sitting there looking at me i walked around i thought surely it's a vision i'll turn my head look back and there he sat there them little white wings just as snowy as he could be his little yellow feet little yellow beak sitting there looking at me he's watching right straight westward i walked around him like i wouldn't touch him for nothing i walked thrown up the trail looked back they're still set watching me brother as the son of abraham i consider not what the doctor told me i'm going to be well anyhow the third day i went back i was climbing up high many of you know the vision about the indian chief riding that little wall to the west something attracted me off to a big rock about noon time so lay your hands against that and pray god in heaven knows this is true i laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards heaven and started praying i heard a voice coming out of the top of the rocks there said what are you leaning against over your heart i raised back like this my bare shoulders naked from the waist up hot i look back and there was wrote in the quartz in the stone white eagle that's exactly what the vision said that the next message had come forth by i was so excited i run home got a camera come back the next day and tucked a picture of it it was still there wrote in the route white eagle dub leading eagle somehow uh i know i'll tell you before it happens the doctor's a good doc a good doctor no doubt uh i think he's a fine man but i i know i'm going to be over it it's done it's finished i'm going to be well i was thinking is ernie sing that song a few moments ago on the wings of a dove how is the melody today start in front of me ernie all the way snow white dove sing it with me god sent down his pure sweet love or the sign from above the wings of us i understand ernie made two verses that i'm going to make you three verses noah had drifted on the floods many days he searched for land in various ways troubles he had some but not from above for god gave him his sign on the wings of a dove on the wings of a snow god sent down his pure sweet love was a sign from above on the wings jesus our savior came to earth one day he was born in a stable in a manger of hate though here rejected but not from above for god gave us his sign on the wings of a dove [Music] god sent down his pure
