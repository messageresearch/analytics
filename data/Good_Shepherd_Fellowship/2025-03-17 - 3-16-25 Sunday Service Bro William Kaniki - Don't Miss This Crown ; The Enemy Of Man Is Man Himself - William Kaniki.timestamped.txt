[58:27] we will pay attention to the
[58:33] word we'll read verse
[58:40] 11 here is speaking of
[58:47] beatitude our message this morning is
[58:50] don't miss the
[58:54] crown don't miss this this
[59:01] crown and our subtitle is the enemy of a
[59:05] man the
[59:07] man is man
[59:11] himself we will actually go through this
[59:14] thought
[59:15] here we will just read a little bit
[59:21] here if you take verse four
[59:27] watch what Jesus is
[59:37] saying blessed are the poor in spirit
[59:42] for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven amen
[59:48] amen we will go to verse 11
[1:00:04] blessed are ye when men shall devour you
[1:00:08] and persecute you and shall say all
[1:00:10] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:00:13] my name my sake J insist Jesus is uh
[1:00:21] insisting
[1:00:24] Rejoice the Bible does not said don't
[1:00:27] get
[1:00:28] angry but
[1:00:31] rejoice and be exceeding
[1:00:35] glad for great is your
[1:00:40] reward in
[1:00:43] heaven for
[1:00:47] so persecuted they the
[1:00:52] prophet which were before you
[1:00:59] pay attention that the Christian life is
[1:01:01] not
[1:01:02] easy the Christian
[1:01:05] Life it's a spiritual
[1:01:11] [Music]
[1:01:12] athletism if you play the game outside
[1:01:15] of the Norms you'll be
[1:01:17] disqualified it's the same thing as in
[1:01:21] basketball if you play any any any ways
[1:01:25] different than what the Norms are you
[1:01:26] are be
[1:01:30] disqualified and now the the players of
[1:01:32] basketball they have one
[1:01:35] purpose and is to to win the price or
[1:01:39] the
[1:01:41] crown as spiritual
[1:01:46] athlet we have also to gain or to obtain
[1:01:49] that
[1:01:53] crown and Jesus is giving us different
[1:01:56] example of those that have been
[1:01:58] persecuted if you know that they are
[1:02:00] persecuting
[1:02:02] you if they say something wrongly about
[1:02:07] you instead of verifying left and right
[1:02:11] but just
[1:02:12] rejoice and that's my message that's my
[1:02:15] thought you may be
[1:02:17] seated may God bless
[1:02:22] you we will go to the book of second
[1:02:24] Timothy
[1:02:28] verse
[1:02:31] 2 verse
[1:02:35] 5 Paul is saying
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:43] here let's read second
[1:02:46] Timothy it says to
[1:02:52] Timothy thou therefore endure hardness
[1:02:55] as a good sold of Jesus
[1:03:01] Christ endure hard hardness as a good
[1:03:04] soldier of Jesus
[1:03:08] Christ to find Soldier or to recruit
[1:03:11] soldiers there are
[1:03:18] conditions and the are it's not easy for
[1:03:20] those that have uh weak nerves
[1:03:25] brother Benham says that the army of God
[1:03:27] are
[1:03:30] selected God does not just pick or
[1:03:32] recruit any type
[1:03:35] of God picked up Daniel because he knew
[1:03:37] his
[1:03:41] caliber he took shadra M and ab because
[1:03:43] he knew who he was who
[1:03:46] they we are the Royal Seed of
[1:03:50] Abraham we don't
[1:03:53] think we actually breaking PE this is
[1:03:56] our
[1:03:58] reasoning we report everything that is
[1:04:00] contrary to the
[1:04:02] word considering as
[1:04:08] unexist but the Bible says Abraham
[1:04:11] regardless of his
[1:04:13] age regardless of the age of
[1:04:17] Sarah she already was into
[1:04:21] menopause she was already old in age
[1:04:24] [Music]
[1:04:26] she did not doubt concerning the
[1:04:30] promise and if we are the Seed of
[1:04:35] Abraham every seed must bring forth
[1:04:38] after its own
[1:04:40] kind
[1:04:42] suffer you must
[1:04:47] suffer the Bible says here
[1:04:56] and if a man also strive for
[1:05:01] mastering yet he is not
[1:05:06] crowned except is tribe
[1:05:14] lawfully the the athlet or the mastering
[1:05:17] yet is not grounded except is Strive
[1:05:21] lawfully set seven comp
[1:05:27] consider what I
[1:05:35] say and the Lord give thee understanding
[1:05:38] in all
[1:05:40] things and what we need
[1:05:43] today it's not men that are
[1:05:48] smart we want people that are
[1:05:53] wise wisdom is more important in
[1:05:58] intelligence and we will go little by
[1:06:02] little I will just give you a little uh
[1:06:07] summary how we must overcome how we will
[1:06:11] overcome brother bham says
[1:06:15] this brother bham says I will teach you
[1:06:18] how to overcome how to fight how to
[1:06:21] fight
[1:06:26] I will teach you how to uh uh uh ese
[1:06:31] escape the the the
[1:06:38] uh the punches of the enemy before
[1:06:40] before he reaches to you yes that's
[1:06:42] right before he reaches to you I speak
[1:06:47] Spanish I preach in
[1:06:51] Spanish it's been a long time since I
[1:06:54] spoke French
[1:06:58] so if I speak in just forgive me for
[1:07:02] it I always uh preaching
[1:07:08] Spanish now I'm standing in front of a
[1:07:10] church that speaks English
[1:07:13] amen we'll go little by little
[1:07:16] here amen
[1:07:20] amen because Satan has a punch against
[1:07:23] you
[1:07:30] now you have to be able to be wise to
[1:07:32] identify that this is the punes of the
[1:07:33] enemy
[1:07:37] coming you cannot by yourself go fight
[1:07:40] against Satan because you don't have
[1:07:41] strength to go against
[1:07:44] him he stopped punching people since
[1:07:49] Eden he knows the word more than most of
[1:07:51] the
[1:07:53] Believers now Satan and God usually
[1:07:56] discuss about the
[1:07:59] word but brother says here in the only
[1:08:02] place of
[1:08:06] worship preach in
[1:08:08] 1965 in the
[1:08:11] morning paragraph
[1:08:13] two brother says
[1:08:19] this brown I was sitting over there
[1:08:22] talking to my old friend brother Brown
[1:08:24] while the song was going on
[1:08:28] and he
[1:08:30] said Bram brother
[1:08:35] Bram brother
[1:08:39] Bram I never seen until
[1:08:43] yesterday what you've been talking
[1:08:48] about there are many people that come to
[1:08:50] church they have no idea why are they
[1:08:51] coming to church
[1:08:58] and there are many people that come and
[1:09:00] sing and and give tith and they sing and
[1:09:02] then go
[1:09:05] on but they forget that we are Pilgrim
[1:09:07] and
[1:09:11] passengers every single one of us has a
[1:09:13] limited time on
[1:09:15] Earth there are people that will only
[1:09:17] live for 30 years and others will leave
[1:09:20] for 9
[1:09:21] years now they will just leave for a day
[1:09:26] every single one of us have an appointed
[1:09:29] time but we have all met on
[1:09:33] Earth so if you were my brother in
[1:09:35] heaven you will be my brother on
[1:09:40] Earth if you were not my brother in
[1:09:42] heaven you will never be my brother in
[1:09:45] on
[1:09:47] Earth because God created us in
[1:09:51] heaven he not created us on Earth
[1:09:56] creation did not begin on
[1:09:59] Earth creation began in
[1:10:03] heaven that's where they were worshiping
[1:10:08] God that's why God was speaking to job
[1:10:10] and
[1:10:11] say where were
[1:10:15] you when the sons of God were worshiping
[1:10:19] me so if you were worshiping God in
[1:10:22] heaven here you will worship him as well
[1:10:26] if you never worship Him in heaven on
[1:10:29] Earth you cannot worship
[1:10:32] him that's why you have to be careful
[1:10:34] what kind of friendship you getting
[1:10:35] yourself
[1:10:37] involed every friendship that put you
[1:10:40] apart from Jesus Christ it's not the
[1:10:44] right and every friendship that brings
[1:10:46] you
[1:10:47] down it's not
[1:10:50] friendship you must have a friendship
[1:10:52] that brings you higher into the word
[1:10:58] why there are many that are afraid to
[1:11:01] sing to worship
[1:11:05] God somebody you see somebody's afraid
[1:11:08] to show that he's a
[1:11:10] Christian and many people are afraid or
[1:11:13] ashame that's why Paul says I'm not
[1:11:15] ashamed of the gospel because the power
[1:11:17] of
[1:11:19] God until
[1:11:22] yesterday I never understood what you
[1:11:24] were talking about
[1:11:29] what you have been talking he already
[1:11:30] spoken Spen but one specific that was
[1:11:34] only
[1:11:36] yesterday he understood what brother
[1:11:38] bham was talking about brother bham
[1:11:44] said If people could just get into what
[1:11:47] you are speaking about he
[1:11:51] said every obstacle will move out of the
[1:11:53] way that's exactly right that's right
[1:11:58] it's exactly
[1:12:00] right if you could just grasp
[1:12:07] it if people could be able to penetrate
[1:12:10] to catch to
[1:12:13] grasp to enter into the
[1:12:18] spirit the obstacle will fall off by
[1:12:23] itself why do we have obstacle
[1:12:26] it's
[1:12:28] because we have not Gras or penetrate
[1:12:31] the spirit of God
[1:12:35] yet people think that to be a a message
[1:12:39] believer is to walk
[1:12:42] with or to have a serious face like
[1:12:45] this may God bless you
[1:12:49] brother how are you doing
[1:12:53] brother beloved you are you are you
[1:12:57] okay and that's
[1:13:01] what be a sister does not mean you
[1:13:03] should have a
[1:13:06] long to be a brother is not to have a
[1:13:09] Corporal
[1:13:12] aspect to be a brother is to obey the
[1:13:16] word the one who obey the
[1:13:18] word is the one who the child of
[1:13:21] God the one who disobey the word of God
[1:13:25] even if he has
[1:13:27] a even if he has a good
[1:13:31] aspect that's not a son of
[1:13:35] God God did not created us on
[1:13:39] Earth and read the message that day on
[1:13:42] calary paragraph
[1:13:47] 45 and the Earth in which we are walking
[1:13:52] into not just the Earth even our body
[1:13:55] here it's the
[1:14:00] Earth
[1:14:03] Satan in the
[1:14:05] morning early early
[1:14:08] morning
[1:14:10] came he put a his foot step a
[1:14:16] step when the Earth was in the form of a
[1:14:21] Vulcan before the Earth can be the Way
[1:14:23] You Are
[1:14:25] he was like a
[1:14:28] vcan and Satan put his his
[1:14:34] foot Satan knew that the Earth will be
[1:14:40] cold he knew that God would form men out
[1:14:44] of the
[1:14:46] earth when Satan sin in
[1:14:51] heaven when all of us even demon
[1:14:53] included were in heaven
[1:14:57] nobody was on
[1:15:01] earth when Moses says that in the
[1:15:03] beginning of the
[1:15:05] word the Earth was a
[1:15:09] void Moses did not see the step of the
[1:15:12] foot of Satan on
[1:15:15] Earth that's why he required the Rev
[1:15:21] reation Mal had to come
[1:15:27] he said God so that we can understand
[1:15:30] that God cannot create something that
[1:15:32] was already
[1:15:34] deformed when God creates there is
[1:15:38] perfection when God gives you a pastor
[1:15:40] give you a perfect
[1:15:43] Pastor when God gives you something is
[1:15:48] perfect when God created the Earth was
[1:15:52] perfect who created the deformation
[1:15:56] when we were in
[1:15:57] heaven Satan put his foot on
[1:16:02] Earth is in yeah his
[1:16:04] footprint and he put his footprint on
[1:16:07] Earth and and Satan kick him out God
[1:16:10] kicking out
[1:16:11] K when
[1:16:19] in when he sin in
[1:16:22] heaven God kicked him out of
[1:16:27] Heaven Satan
[1:16:31] came he took his property without
[1:16:37] title so God in order for God to form
[1:16:43] us he put us on
[1:16:49] Earth he put to inside of us the half of
[1:16:54] the of the
[1:16:58] remember knowing well that not even one
[1:17:01] of his elect will be will be
[1:17:07] lost but in every single age he will
[1:17:10] pick up his own
[1:17:12] children
[1:17:15] Satan he prepared a a a a punch against
[1:17:19] Jesus he knew that
[1:17:23] God will need is element to make or to
[1:17:26] form
[1:17:29] men so when God form
[1:17:34] men what is created is the soul
[1:17:37] of the soul is
[1:17:40] created but the Earth or the body the
[1:17:43] flesh is
[1:17:47] formed people the Bible says oh creation
[1:17:50] creation is not creation it's formation
[1:17:53] is to form
[1:17:56] that's why Jesus says the soul that
[1:17:59] sinth is the one that will
[1:18:02] die Jesus did not say the body that
[1:18:06] sins he says the soul that
[1:18:09] Sinn who sins is the one that will
[1:18:13] die if the
[1:18:17] Earth God took the 16 element of the
[1:18:19] earth
[1:18:23] and the men was created in the image of
[1:18:25] God was the spirit
[1:18:29] man now the spirit cannot
[1:18:35] fall because God is
[1:18:39] reproducing now this body here this
[1:18:42] flesh here is the animal
[1:18:45] man man with a a footprint of
[1:18:51] Satan that's why the new birth is
[1:18:54] required
[1:18:57] so now when we go to
[1:19:01] glory is the body without a footprint of
[1:19:07] Satan now God takes away the the imprint
[1:19:11] of
[1:19:12] Satan that's why that day on
[1:19:17] calary he came and walk into the imprint
[1:19:20] of the
[1:19:23] enemy he came and eras his job inside of
[1:19:29] you you were not a son of God when you
[1:19:32] believe you were sons of God before the
[1:19:35] foundation of
[1:19:37] world when you step into the
[1:19:40] Earth you accepted the message of the
[1:19:43] hour of your
[1:19:45] time without anybody to explain to you
[1:19:48] anything that's why you can get
[1:19:51] mad you can see a Son of God getting mad
[1:19:54] normal it's
[1:19:56] normal because it's just the the the
[1:20:00] footprint the imprint of
[1:20:05] Satan you you have to be careful what
[1:20:07] your eyes are telling
[1:20:10] you now the Bible says that the eyes is
[1:20:13] the lamp of the
[1:20:16] body so if your eyes does not see
[1:20:19] clear your your entire body will be in
[1:20:22] darkness
[1:20:26] the eyes is the lamp of the entire body
[1:20:29] our eyes
[1:20:32] here are connected to our
[1:20:37] feelings you look at a person like this
[1:20:41] then you get mad
[1:20:42] automatically you look at
[1:20:45] somebody your feeling
[1:20:48] changes that's something that is
[1:20:49] bubbling inside of you it's
[1:20:53] Satan now I'll show you the mistake that
[1:20:56] we usually
[1:20:57] make the soul that sin not the
[1:21:02] body the the the Samaritan woman she was
[1:21:06] a
[1:21:08] prostitute but she was a daughter of God
[1:21:13] Jesus knew that
[1:21:16] she she was a daughter of
[1:21:19] God Jesus know that you
[1:21:23] here no matter regardless of your Mist
[1:21:26] you are a son and a daughter of
[1:21:28] God but when the word is preached you
[1:21:32] say Amen to the
[1:21:34] word you receive the
[1:21:37] word now look in his
[1:21:40] body five
[1:21:42] husband and the sixth
[1:21:45] one was not even her husband what kind
[1:21:48] of
[1:21:50] life but she was a daughter of God
[1:21:56] the imprint of
[1:21:57] Satan touch her oh push her to do these
[1:22:03] things but the imprint regardless of the
[1:22:06] imprint of Satan it does not
[1:22:10] mean don't judge a person by based on
[1:22:13] what you are
[1:22:15] seeing but your eyes will judge
[1:22:17] wrongly because
[1:22:21] you you don't know who is the Son of God
[1:22:23] and who is not a son of God
[1:22:26] somebody say glory to
[1:22:29] God be
[1:22:33] wise that's why there are many people
[1:22:35] that judge brother
[1:22:38] bam brother bam that you
[1:22:41] think Jesus that you said that you
[1:22:49] believe people did not believe that
[1:22:51] Jesus was born of a of a virgin
[1:22:56] they just saw mared with a
[1:22:58] baby all of these people did not
[1:23:02] believe now watch the grace that God has
[1:23:05] given to
[1:23:07] you now look somebody that is doing
[1:23:10] fine the Rich Young
[1:23:14] Ruler he met
[1:23:17] Jesus the the person the most important
[1:23:20] person on Earth he told
[1:23:23] him says there's something that is
[1:23:28] missing how many things that you are
[1:23:30] missing here in your own
[1:23:34] life but to the Rich Young Ruler there's
[1:23:36] only one thing missing God spoke to
[1:23:40] him I can't see in your body you are
[1:23:43] perfect that's very
[1:23:45] good Now
[1:23:48] obey
[1:23:49] go sell everything that you've got give
[1:23:52] it to the poor and come and follow me he
[1:23:56] look at
[1:23:57] Jesus he see Jesus wearing
[1:24:02] sandals he sees himself well dressed
[1:24:05] with a lot of
[1:24:06] money he said
[1:24:09] me obeying a man with sand his eye
[1:24:14] missed he missed the mark by by his
[1:24:17] side the eyes is the lamp of the
[1:24:21] body so if your eyes is does not look
[1:24:24] perf
[1:24:25] your whole body will be in in
[1:24:30] darkness now the Rich Young R forsake he
[1:24:33] went to
[1:24:35] hell if people could
[1:24:38] penetrate If people could
[1:24:43] understand and Jesus says this in
[1:24:47] Matthew Chapter
[1:24:48] [Applause]
[1:24:50] 5 blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:24:58] the the small a
[1:25:02] yeah there's a difference between the
[1:25:04] holy
[1:25:06] spirit it's the spirit so S capital
[1:25:12] S and this the S is really
[1:25:16] capitalized but to with man is is
[1:25:20] minuscule because
[1:25:22] man is uh
[1:25:25] Soul spirit and body all men all the
[1:25:30] men as
[1:25:34] men
[1:25:36] spirit it's
[1:25:38] life that is in
[1:25:41] us when man
[1:25:44] dies regardless if he was a pagan or a
[1:25:47] Christian his
[1:25:49] Spirit goes back to
[1:25:52] God the body
[1:25:54] goes to the
[1:25:56] grave but now there's a problem with the
[1:25:59] soul the problem is
[1:26:02] the now the soul that sinth is the one
[1:26:06] that will
[1:26:07] die so if you had believed Jesus if you
[1:26:11] had
[1:26:13] obeyed the angel will carry you the day
[1:26:16] of your
[1:26:19] death if you were a A nonbeliever or
[1:26:23] aever
[1:26:24] you don't have any
[1:26:27] Crown you will go first to hell that's
[1:26:36] true blessed are the poor in
[1:26:40] spirit now the spirit has five
[1:26:46] senses
[1:26:49] imagination reasoning
[1:26:54] be poor in reason
[1:26:59] reason a Believer does not seek to have
[1:27:02] reason or
[1:27:07] to a Christian will forsake his own
[1:27:12] reason or own
[1:27:17] reasoning
[1:27:19] feelings or
[1:27:22] affection I feel
[1:27:25] this is not the The Life of
[1:27:27] Christ stop your
[1:27:31] feelings you don't know who is the Son
[1:27:33] of God your feeling will lie to
[1:27:38] you we have
[1:27:41] reasoning it's the sense one of the
[1:27:43] sense of the
[1:27:47] spirit God want us to be poor in
[1:27:52] reasoning does he say it does not say
[1:27:54] bless are the poor in
[1:27:57] money it says poor in
[1:28:00] spirit don't reason when the word is pre
[1:28:03] believe the word of
[1:28:05] God forsake
[1:28:09] everything don't have try to reason and
[1:28:13] continue so
[1:28:15] forth now we're going

[1:30:27] Now watch how you behave out
[1:30:29] there and a Christian is not just when
[1:30:32] we are
[1:30:33] here now a Christian is practice outside
[1:30:36] when you
[1:30:38] practice and that's when people fail to
[1:30:40] do
[1:30:41] it I've understood a lot of
[1:30:44] things I'm a
[1:30:49] surgeon I I've learned a lot of things
[1:30:52] when you practice you practically do
[1:30:55] it you see the
[1:31:00] responsibility you look say if this
[1:31:03] woman
[1:31:04] dies what can I tell this man

[1:31:13] hospital running he says doctor doctor
[1:31:15] he thinks that you are
[1:31:17] God he does not understand he does not
[1:31:21] understand that this
[1:31:22] man make mistakes
[1:31:25] he can make
[1:31:27] mistakes imagine such a mistake in your
[1:31:29] own life now now
[1:31:32] realize if any
[1:31:42] man and whosoever shall compel thee to

[1:32:10] enemy bless them that curse
[1:32:19] you 43 ye have heard that he has been
[1:32:23] said thou shall love thy neighbor and
[1:32:26] hate thy
[1:32:27] enemies and Me
[1:32:29] Jesus I said unto
[1:32:32] you love your
[1:32:35] enemies that's what Christianity is
[1:32:39] about what you have come to do here this
[1:32:45] morning love your
[1:32:50] enemies bless them that curse you
[1:32:58] do good to them that hate
[1:33:03] you and pray for them which despitefully
[1:33:06] use you and persecute you that's my
[1:33:10] message
[1:33:12] Brothers don't miss this
[1:33:15] Crown because the enemy of a man is man
[1:33:21] himself right

[1:33:29] heaven but you cannot
[1:33:34] forgive you say oh we're going to heaven
[1:33:37] when you see a brother
[1:33:38] outside you think like oh wow this one
[1:33:41] that's according that's what you
[1:33:45] see how many time have you pray for that
[1:33:49] brother the mission of the church
[1:33:54] is to save those that
[1:33:57] are because the blood of Jesus
[1:34:01] Christ speaks
[1:34:03] better of more than the blood of
[1:34:06] Abel Abel was a bad a really uh
[1:34:16] uh was not a good
[1:34:19] person look at the behavior of
[1:34:24] now it's God who shows the behavior of
[1:34:27] abble to
[1:34:30] K it says the blood of your
[1:34:33] brother speak
[1:34:35] Vengeance from the
[1:34:39] earth he wanted Abel wanted also God to
[1:34:43] kill
[1:34:44] Abel so God can punish
[1:34:48] Abel a Christian
[1:34:54] the one that uh a pagan
[1:34:59] is
[1:35:00] Ming he would pray
[1:35:04] God please kill my
[1:35:08] neighbor so that he can know that I
[1:35:10] really have God my brother and sister if
[1:35:13] you are at that
[1:35:15] level that you have never understood
[1:35:18] yet the blood of Jesus you are a
[1:35:22] daughter of God okay
[1:35:24] if you are a daughter of
[1:35:26] God the blood of Jesus
[1:35:28] Christ speaks of better things than the
[1:35:32] one of
[1:35:33] abble what does the blood of Jesus the
[1:35:36] blood of
[1:35:37] Jes when Jesus
[1:35:39] was they actually spit on him he
[1:35:44] insulted
[1:35:46] him he practic practice his own
[1:35:51] word he says
[1:35:54] father for them of their
[1:35:58] sin because they know not what they are
[1:36:03] doing what does the blood of Jesus
[1:36:05] Christ the blood of Jesus
[1:36:09] Christ speaks on favor of the of the
[1:36:14] guilty the blood of
[1:36:16] Jesus is an
[1:36:18] advocate for the one that is guilty Paul
[1:36:22] Paul s
[1:36:25] s criminal was a
[1:36:32] criminal he killed sons of God like

[1:36:42] of
[1:36:44] St a brother kill your

[1:37:38] world the the worldly things are the
[1:37:41] foolishness for the gospel that's what
[1:37:43] the gospel is
[1:37:44] about the
[1:37:49] Forgiveness the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:37:52] speaks of better things
[1:37:54] brother
[1:37:56] bam when he was preaching here in
[1:38:00] the there were two young people that
[1:38:02] were
[1:38:03] kissing and the man of
[1:38:06] God he said stop what you are doing over
[1:38:09] there the Bible says the Bible say the
[1:38:12] Bible says they didn't listen they
[1:38:15] continue to kiss one
[1:38:18] another he he was a snare of the enemy
[1:38:25] he was was the Trap of the enemy how can
[1:38:28] you not identify the Trap of the
[1:38:32] enemy that's why not even one Among Us
[1:38:34] can Resurrect The
[1:38:41] Dead no now brother somebody that died
[1:38:46] and and resurrected him back to
[1:38:48] life I don't believe such
[1:38:51] things I'm a doctor
[1:38:55] I know what death
[1:38:57] means don't just come and say somebody
[1:39:02] fell he says that he's
[1:39:05] dead are you a doctor to to certify that
[1:39:07] he's dead that's why all this light
[1:39:10] going
[1:39:14] on I will show you something that
[1:39:19] bam was capable
[1:39:24] to go
[1:39:25] beyond to see that the young people that
[1:39:28] were there they were kissing in service
[1:39:31] in the mid in
[1:39:32] service without cursing
[1:39:35] them now you will see a pastor it
[1:39:41] says and you have come to give bad
[1:39:44] examples this is the Church of the
[1:39:45] Living God
[1:39:48] me but if it was your own son you would
[1:39:51] not do that if he was your sister you
[1:39:53] would not do it now you're doing
[1:39:56] it is just to show off the
[1:39:59] people you have to go
[1:40:01] above you have to be
[1:40:05] wise you you have to know that God gives
[1:40:07] us
[1:40:09] test you will see how we would react to
[1:40:11] that
[1:40:12] test because without
[1:40:15] suffering there is no
[1:40:18] Crown
[1:40:20] amen all every Christian
[1:40:24] has to
[1:40:25] suffer that's the
[1:40:28] condition Jesus did not carry all
[1:40:33] this left a little bit of suffering to
[1:40:36] the
[1:40:38] bride so that she can grow with
[1:40:42] suffering so that she can be molded by
[1:40:45] by
[1:40:49] suffering only me
[1:40:54] because you are daughter of
[1:40:56] God that's why it's happening to you
[1:40:59] that's why it's
[1:41:01] happening
[1:41:04] Rejoice be
[1:41:07] grateful and God spoke to
[1:41:11] brother I I will let you
[1:41:14] decide decide whatever whatever you will
[1:41:16] say that's what will happen to them if
[1:41:19] you say death they will die right on the
[1:41:21] spot if you say par
[1:41:26] butam never said
[1:41:28] death the blood of Jesus
[1:41:31] Christ speaks of better
[1:41:35] things he says young people over there I
[1:41:37] forgive
[1:41:39] you a Christian without pardoning does
[1:41:42] not exist
[1:41:44] amen one day brother comes out of the
[1:41:49] church you see one of the the girls from
[1:41:52] the church she was
[1:41:54] there and but gets closer to
[1:41:57] her how are you
[1:42:03] doing I know that you have already bad
[1:42:05] intention don't even come closer and
[1:42:06] embrace
[1:42:17] me and God knows that I don't have
[1:42:20] this don't get closer to me not even try
[1:42:23] to get closer to
[1:42:28] me the Kingdom of
[1:42:32] Heaven
[1:42:35] later find
[1:42:38] that really dressed not she was not well
[1:42:42] well
[1:42:43] dressed she was walking and brother bam
[1:42:47] came he was right behind
[1:42:49] her said don't follow me don't follow me
[1:42:56] she took off a a cigarette and she said
[1:42:58] to brother bam do you want to smoke with
[1:43:00] me you also want to
[1:43:04] drink brother say what are you
[1:43:12] doing now as they were walking can you
[1:43:15] just imagine
[1:43:19] theet
[1:43:22] now did not
[1:43:24] look I can even get closer
[1:43:28] to brother B was doying everything to
[1:43:31] bring people to
[1:43:33] Christ and that's what we ought to
[1:43:37] do and tells her what are you acting
[1:43:42] thus he
[1:43:45] says he says the last time that you
[1:43:47] spoke in that service was my last day to
[1:43:49] to to to know
[1:43:53] no it was the day that I crossed the
[1:43:55] line brothers and
[1:43:57] sisters there's going to be a
[1:43:59] day it will be the last
[1:44:04] sermon people are used to come to
[1:44:07] church because he became like a second
[1:44:11] nature people are not ready to be
[1:44:14] transformed people don't pray for the
[1:44:18] guilty they're ready to hear bad news
[1:44:25] they don't want to see a brother or
[1:44:27] sister to
[1:44:30] prosper the bad news they're ready to
[1:44:32] talk about it but when is a good news
[1:44:35] they stay
[1:44:37] quiet that's
[1:44:39] it and with that and we think we're
[1:44:42] going to
[1:44:45] heaven he again say that I went to fast
[1:44:48] for a brother or a sister
[1:44:53] and now he has become a burden in
[1:44:56] him is it's not what we are doing
[1:45:01] here if there are people that will be
[1:45:04] surprised is those that claim to be
[1:45:07] Christian because the majority will not
[1:45:09] go to
[1:45:10] heaven
[1:45:12] why because they are
[1:45:16] disqualified because they willingly
[1:45:18] decide to make that decision
[1:45:23] why we are not able to do even a little
[1:45:25] tiny
[1:45:26] Miracle
[1:45:28] brother they cannot come bring back
[1:45:32] life because we are full of really bad
[1:45:37] feelings may God forgive
[1:45:41] us take take the Bible with me in Psalm
[1:45:46] 12 the Bible says here in the book of
[1:45:48] Psalm 12 verse
[1:45:51] two etern
[1:45:55] they speak
[1:46:05] vanity help Lord For The Godly Man
[1:46:14] ceaseth help Lord For The Godly
[1:46:19] men it's R to find a
[1:46:21] man it's hardly to fight them you can't
[1:46:25] count
[1:46:26] one and then the dead are gone people
[1:46:30] G and the bad ones are
[1:46:33] remaining is the
[1:46:36] the is the Cry of David help
[1:46:42] Lord For The Godly Man seeth for the
[1:46:45] faithful fail from among the children of
[1:46:49] man they speak vanity every everyone
[1:46:53] with his
[1:46:57] neighbor with flattering lips and with a
[1:47:00] with flattering
[1:47:06] lips and with double Hearts do they
[1:47:09] speak the Lord shall cut off the
[1:47:10] flattering lips and
[1:47:15] the speak of proud
[1:47:21] things who who have said with our tongue
[1:47:24] we will
[1:47:33] prevail our lips our house own our own
[1:47:37] who is Lord over
[1:47:51] us for the oppression of the poor and
[1:47:54] for the sighing of the needy now I are
[1:47:56] raised said the Lord I will set him in
[1:47:59] safety from him that per at
[1:48:05] him the words of the Lord are pure
[1:48:09] words the word is pure but why are you
[1:48:12] not
[1:48:14] pure be pure as the word
[1:48:17] is and the result will be pure
[1:48:28] as silver tried in the the furnace of
[1:48:30] Earth purified seven
[1:48:46] times for thou thou shall keep them oh
[1:48:49] Lord thou shall preserve them from this
[1:48:51] generation forever
[1:48:55] the wicked work on every
[1:49:01] side when the Violent Men are
[1:49:05] exalted the pure men are being uh
[1:49:12] ceasing the Bible also speaks of
[1:49:14] flattering leaps and double
[1:49:18] hearted men are flattering
[1:49:25] watch verse
[1:49:26] four verse
[1:49:35] three they speak vanity everyone with
[1:49:38] his heart with flattering lips and with
[1:49:39] double heart do they speak verse
[1:49:46] two a double hearted men or
[1:49:51] women vers three yes they speak vanity
[1:49:55] everyone with his neighbor with
[1:49:56] flattering lips and with double heart do
[1:49:58] they speak double heart

[1:50:08] double you think it's a
[1:50:11] brother but everything that you say is

[1:51:03] brother amen

[2:04:58] to not to create problem and
[2:05:01] conflict now
[2:05:03] men are blessed without
[2:05:07] Ministries God has blessed
[2:05:09] them give them
[2:05:12] Ministries now it's hard to find
[2:05:14] somebody that is serious it's
[2:05:17] difficult that's why you got to pray for

[2:05:26] find pray that God
[2:05:28] keep pray that
[2:05:30] God because
[2:05:33] you you a sheep you need the good
[2:05:38] food that's why I met brothers that said

[2:05:50] Ghost now I told him said can we carry

[2:21:15] there that's what hypocrisy
[2:21:18] is that's the double heart that we have
[2:21:21] to get rid
[2:21:22] of be
[2:21:24] original you your
[2:21:27] pastor tell him
[2:21:29] things look at this
[2:21:32] that respect your pastor love
[2:21:36] him don't change him for somebody
[2:21:40] else support your
[2:21:43] pastor don't look to other person
[2:21:50] because it's not me who had
[2:21:53] preached yeah that's true it's not him
[2:21:57] who why are you bringing asking question
[2:22:00] go ask the one that you listen
[2:22:02] to love your
[2:22:04] pastor watch what God God
[2:22:07] now God test
[2:22:10] us he gives us men with
[2:22:14] mistakes look at Moses he didn't know
[2:22:17] how to speak
[2:22:21] he gave him 2 million under his
[2:22:24] Dominion he's the one with mistakes he
[2:22:27] had anger
[2:22:29] issue
[2:22:31] two speak you couldn't
[2:22:34] speak he had a hard time to
[2:22:37] speak and Moses was speaking for a long
[2:22:41] time you had patience to just listen to
[2:22:44] him now if you lose patience you are
[2:22:48] disqualified believing Moes it was to
[2:22:52] believe
[2:22:54] God look at
[2:22:57] Peter a very terrible
[2:23:00] man but
[2:23:03] God made
[2:23:05] Peter a
[2:23:08] reference a reference to enter
[2:23:11] Heaven he says the baptism is the name
[2:23:13] of Jesus Christ God takes a man with
[2:23:18] mistakes to lead you the to the way
[2:23:22] of there's not going to be a man a
[2:23:24] perfect
[2:23:25] man you are lying to
[2:23:28] yourself that you will find a man that
[2:23:30] is
[2:23:31] perfect I have mistakes I have a lot of
[2:23:34] mistakes a
[2:23:36] lot but I am saved by the grace of

[2:23:43] appla
[2:23:45] you I will appla you I said thank
[2:23:49] God and I know that they are liars
[2:23:52] because the Bible
[2:23:54] says all men are liars only God is
[2:24:00] truth Holy Ghost manufactured
[2:24:05] Hol instead of taking an authentic Holy
[2:24:08] Ghost we take things that are
[2:24:11] manufactured ja chapter one James
[2:24:14] chapter
[2:24:16] one let's finish with

[2:25:10] has promised to them that love
[2:25:14] him don't miss or lose your
[2:25:17] crown be P be patient
[2:25:22] God will will will will prove
[2:25:26] youest because God goes through the
[2:25:31] fire to be a genuine gold it has to go

[2:25:35] fire now a Christian must go through
[2:25:47] trials let no man said when he tempted I
[2:25:50] am tempted of God for God cannot be
[2:25:53] tempted with evil neither temp he any
[2:26:04] man but every man is tempted when he is
[2:26:07] drawn away of his own last and
[2:26:11] enticed what kind of last do
[2:26:14] you last is the flesh
[2:26:26] then when last has conceived he bringeth
[2:26:28] forth sin and sin when it is finished
