[0:00] thank you for what you have done for us
[0:03] we just cannot express from our hearts
[0:07] how we appreciate this and how you come
[0:09] to our rescue
[0:11] when we're in trouble we have learned
[0:13] through the years to trust you and
[0:15] believe you
[0:16] and i pray this afternoon lord that you
[0:18] will pour your
[0:19] blessings upon this people may there not
[0:22] be a feeble person in our midst when
[0:24] this service is injured
[0:25] if there would be one in here who's not
[0:27] right with god
[0:29] may the power that raised jesus from the
[0:31] grave
[0:32] quicken their mortal bodies lord and
[0:34] their soul and turn them to you
[0:36] granted those without the holy spirit
[0:38] may just be the
[0:40] one great day that they'll never forget
[0:47] lord forgive our sins we would pray that
[0:51] you would bless brother sullivan
[0:53] our gracious and precious friend
[0:56] and his thoughts for the people and
[1:00] to try to bring them every possibility
[1:03] that he can to help him i pray that
[1:06] you'll bless brother sullivan
[1:08] bless the ministers throughout the land
[1:10] everywhere
[1:12] give to them an exceeding abundance of
[1:14] lord may they stand gallon in the pulpit
[1:16] and proclaim the word of god
[1:19] for we're living in the closing hours of
[1:21] the history of this world
[1:23] let thy goodness overshadow us
[1:26] in these times for we ask that in jesus
[1:29] name
[1:30] amen
[1:37] i am so grateful to you people as
[1:40] to god for this
[1:44] brother sullivan tuck it up on himself
[1:48] you see it would be right for brother
[1:50] sullivan to do that
[1:51] so we were fixed to prepare for we thank
[1:54] you for your kindness and now
[1:56] for the love offering if
[1:59] you didn't have to do that you know that
[2:02] wasn't necessary
[2:03] just they paid expenses the hotel
[2:07] and the food what we had that that stuff
[2:10] was necessary
[2:11] but thank you very kindly and it'll go
[2:14] to help missionary and bring
[2:17] people to god there won't be any
[2:19] cigarettes about with
[2:20] any whiskey nothing is wrong you'll go
[2:23] for the right thing
[2:24] and i pray that god will put that on
[2:27] your account
[2:28] up there and multiply it by 10 pounds
[2:31] each dollar or penny or nickel that you
[2:34] gave towards
[2:35] this service and now i want to thank
[2:39] the united states army
[2:43] for letting us have this building to set
[2:45] in
[2:46] to have these services i certainly do
[2:50] thank them with all my heart and as i
[2:53] understand brother sullivan said
[2:54] everything would be paid up
[2:55] right we've never left a city yet on one
[2:59] cent
[2:59] what everything is taking care of we
[3:01] just don't believe in anything else
[3:03] you mustn't oh anyone you must be square
[3:06] and straight
[3:07] and if you owe somebody go face them and
[3:09] tell them that you're old but
[3:10] just give you a little time your faith
[3:12] always
[3:14] that's a better that's a good mark of
[3:15] christianity
[3:17] be an honest upbringing you want to live
[3:20] just what you talk about
[3:21] if you don't live it yourself how'd you
[3:23] expect somebody else to live
[3:25] so you are written epistles read of all
[3:27] men so
[3:29] always be honest just true tell the
[3:31] truth
[3:32] no matter how bad i've heard something
[3:33] tell the truth anyhow
[3:35] because you can always tell it the same
[3:37] way each time
[3:38] and you tell a lie you'll have to go a
[3:40] million miles around and still you have
[3:42] come back to that lie again and you've
[3:43] made an awful thing
[3:44] just be honest and you can always tell
[3:46] it the same way because it's the truth
[3:48] that's way at the bible tell it just the
[3:50] way the bible says it don't
[3:52] compromise with it see it just that way
[3:54] it's written right here
[3:56] and you can point your finger to it
[3:59] that's where you defeat satan
[4:01] satan said to jesus if thou be the son
[4:04] of god i see you perform a miracle they
[4:06] say you're a miracle worker turn these
[4:07] stones to bread and
[4:09] let's see you're hungry he said but it
[4:11] is written man shall not live by bread
[4:13] alone
[4:14] he took the father's word and defeated
[4:16] the devil right on his own grounds
[4:19] so you can do the same thing defeat the
[4:21] devil
[4:22] on his grounds with the word of the lord
[4:26] then i will always be grateful to
[4:28] brother solomon
[4:30] this excuse this expression
[4:35] i think when they're made by the soul
[4:36] and they throw away the pattern
[4:40] i think there's only one man i ever met
[4:42] in my life that reminded me of brother
[4:44] sullivan that was e howard cable i don't
[4:46] know whether he ever known him or not
[4:47] from the from brother caleb was just a
[4:50] good old
[4:51] country boy brother sullivan and
[4:54] he'd stick his hands down his pocket so
[4:56] far to his suspenders he'd draw way down
[4:58] and
[4:59] talk with his head sideways and he was
[5:01] just one he hired care
[5:03] and so i'm i'm so glad to have brother
[5:06] sullivan
[5:07] as a friend and a brother in the gospel
[5:12] and i pray that god will bless him in
[5:14] his little church
[5:15] up here his precious wife
[5:19] his loved ones and to you
[5:22] the other ministers that you're to you
[5:25] and your congregation
[5:27] full gospel preachers
[5:30] upon little technical things of the
[5:33] scripture
[5:34] we might disagree with one another i
[5:37] disagree with
[5:38] my wife on some things you know what
[5:41] that's on
[5:41] [Music]
[5:44] she likes apple pie and i like cherry
[5:49] so we disagree and i'll tell you what i
[5:51] do with mine
[5:53] i like a good hot piece of cherry pie
[5:56] i could stand it right now
[5:59] and pour butter on top of it and then
[6:02] pour molasses on top of that
[6:05] brother you've got something worth
[6:06] eating
[6:08] my wife's afraid of it i think she's
[6:10] afraid of the calories
[6:12] she might like it but you know how the
[6:14] women are they're afraid it gets the
[6:16] thin you could stick them with a pen
[6:17] cut them to the bone and yet they want
[6:18] to they want to reduce
[6:21] that's the nature of them i guess others
[6:23] and um
[6:25] but i like that now we disagree upon
[6:27] that
[6:28] other things were all right but you see
[6:29] we're not perfectly in agreement
[6:31] so we would see the same thing brethren
[6:35] but the main thing we're eating power
[6:39] that's the main thing principally upon
[6:42] the baptism of the holy spirit
[6:44] and the coming of christ and the great
[6:46] evangelical fundamental doctrines of the
[6:48] bible
[6:48] we certainly stand arm-in-arm with that
[6:52] as one big united brethren
[6:57] without a denominational barrier without
[7:00] anything to hinder us we march
[7:02] towards calgary as one great army
[7:05] together
[7:07] if i can ever be of any help to you i'll
[7:10] be glad to do it
[7:12] and i'm sure you'd say the same thing to
[7:14] me and you can be a help to me
[7:18] and that's one thing you can do that i
[7:20] know is pray for me
[7:22] that god will never let me go wrong i i
[7:24] it's not in my heart to go wrong i want
[7:27] to go right i want to do what's right
[7:29] because i realize as
[7:32] brother jack bohr told me one time he
[7:34] said brother branham i wouldn't stand in
[7:36] your boots for all your experience at
[7:38] the day of the judgment
[7:39] because god's going to require you a
[7:41] great answer
[7:43] that because these give you millions of
[7:45] people in your hands
[7:47] now if i know i'm going to stand there
[7:49] and answer for those people
[7:50] and what kind of the gospel have i got
[7:54] to preach
[7:55] what kind of a sincerity you want to
[7:56] hold the purchase of his blood in my
[7:58] hands
[7:59] and as he's give me a gift
[8:02] beyond a shadow of doubt any sensible
[8:04] thinking person will know it has to come
[8:06] from god
[8:07] and with that if i lead somebody off on
[8:09] the wrong path just because a certain
[8:11] group
[8:11] said that god would make me pay for it
[8:14] at the day of the judgment
[8:15] but when i seen the vision here not long
[8:17] ago and heard them people scream out
[8:19] did you get your little book last night
[8:21] the businessman's voice that's good
[8:24] and in the vision sometimes we'll have
[8:27] it printed
[8:28] in full detail that's not all of it but
[8:31] in that and seeing that and i stood
[8:33] there just as
[8:35] just as i'm standing right now and i was
[8:38] looking at myself laying
[8:39] on the bed watching my wife and yet
[8:42] standing here looking at myself
[8:43] and here was those people standing
[8:45] around like that when i said
[8:47] will paul have to be judged for the
[8:48] gospel he preached said yes
[8:50] i said i've preached every word just
[8:53] exactly the way he did
[8:55] and the millions screamed out we are
[8:57] resting on that
[9:00] that's where i wanted to be on the cross
[9:01] there i want to be that way
[9:03] just like that just what paul said i
[9:05] don't want to add one thing to it take
[9:07] one thing away from it
[9:08] just what the bible said that's this way
[9:10] i want to keep it going
[9:11] and of course you keep it like that
[9:13] denominations on every side
[9:15] is going to rise up a barrier against it
[9:18] and then many times the brethren think
[9:21] that i'm against my brothers god knows
[9:24] different from that as long as he knows
[9:26] what's true
[9:27] see it's not against brethren it's a
[9:30] system that's making us not to be
[9:31] brothers
[9:32] it isn't the word of god keep us from
[9:34] being brothers it's the system that we
[9:36] join into that keeps us from being
[9:38] brothers
[9:39] that's right so where must we stand
[9:42] stand on the word and god will draw man
[9:45] to it that's right
[9:47] don't never organize it denominationally
[9:50] just keep it though
[9:51] in god and just keep moving on just
[9:54] watching the end
[9:55] hold steady god will bring the rest of
[9:57] it
[9:58] [Music]
[10:01] there's been so many things you've done
[10:03] for me i appreciate it
[10:05] now if i can help you towards
[10:08] giving you a prayer cloth or something
[10:11] now don't
[10:12] ask me doctrine because i don't desire
[10:16] to do that
[10:17] so many people writes me questions about
[10:19] marriage and divorce and so forth which
[10:21] is a
[10:21] tangle in the church i always refer them
[10:24] back and say
[10:25] ask your pastor people wrote me a letter
[10:28] and said what about this and what about
[10:30] that i refer the letter back you'll get
[10:32] it
[10:32] see your pastor on a little thing
[10:35] because after all
[10:36] he's your shepherd he's he's the one
[10:38] that god sent to watch over you
[10:40] and we might disagree upon it then that
[10:43] caused a confusion in your church we
[10:44] don't want that
[10:46] no no we just want you to quit doing
[10:48] things that's sinful
[10:49] things out of the bible just keep moving
[10:50] on towards god see
[10:52] and if you cause little frictions and
[10:54] things like that that upsets the church
[10:56] so i'd rather your pastor tell you about
[10:58] marriage and divorce and these things
[11:00] and them things let him do it
[11:02] he's god's servant too and he's
[11:05] equipped to do that remember the good
[11:08] samaritan
[11:09] that found the man wounded he brought
[11:12] him to the end that's the church and
[11:14] gave the man there two tents
[11:16] and told him if he needed any more he
[11:17] pay him when he come so he's got two
[11:19] tents
[11:20] he's able to doctor you if he's a man of
[11:23] god
[11:24] if he's a man of god it stands on the
[11:25] word of god he's got what god give me
[11:28] the spirit and the word is that right
[11:31] how is it word worship in spirit and in
[11:34] truth and the word is the truth is that
[11:36] right
[11:37] now thank you very kindly again
[11:41] and now i'm awfully tired and real tired
[11:44] this afternoon
[11:46] i never instantly stay in another hotel
[11:48] as long as i live

[14:34] verse

[15:19] your prayer calls
[15:21] from the meeting both consecrated
[15:24] christians

[15:47] anytime anything we can do pray for you
[15:49] on the phone anything we can do
[15:50] we'll do it
[15:56] this strange looking man
[16:01] with a staff in his hand
[16:03] [Music]
[16:05] his step study lies
[16:09] gleaming with the glory of god
[16:12] his beard blowing on the side
[16:15] an old hairy piece of sheepskin wrapped
[16:18] around him
[16:19] he's making his step just as sturdy as
[16:22] he walked
[16:23] down the road to samaria
[16:27] he wasn't very much to look at
[16:29] [Music]
[16:31] but he had thus saith the lord
[16:36] for that great nation of israel
[16:39] yeah he lies in the tishby
[16:42] a prophet of the lord
[16:46] he wasn't much to look at but he had the
[16:49] word of the lord
[16:51] he wasn't afraid to stand before the
[16:53] king
[16:54] for he had been the presence of greater
[16:56] than a king
[16:58] he had been in the presence of jehovah
[17:02] therefore he knowed where he was
[17:03] standing
[17:06] [Music]
[17:07] and when he walked before the king he
[17:09] didn't stutter and stammer
[17:12] he know what he was talking about he
[17:15] could
[17:16] say to the king thus saith the lord
[17:19] god of israel there will be no rain or
[17:23] no
[17:23] do until
[17:27] i call for it why did he say that till i
[17:31] called for it according
[17:32] to my word because he had the word of
[17:34] the lord
[17:36] he was a prophet and the prophet has the
[17:39] word of lord
[17:41] [Music]
[17:43] it's a striking thing to see the
[17:46] parallel
[17:47] between israel of the old testament
[17:52] and america now
[17:55] [Music]
[17:57] both of them are great nations
[18:01] both of them had been founded
[18:04] and their people had come there because
[18:07] of religious persecutions
[18:11] [Music]
[18:12] israel had been persecuted
[18:16] by pharaoh and had been in bondage
[18:20] for hundreds of years
[18:23] or they were deprived of worshiping the
[18:26] true and living god
[18:29] and have been deprived of that privilege
[18:34] and they've become slaves
[18:37] but god had made them a promise in his
[18:40] bible
[18:41] for in his word and by his prophets
[18:44] that he'd give them a land
[18:48] and they'd come into this land and drove
[18:50] back the occupants of that land
[18:52] and it possessed their inheritance
[18:58] for god had a purpose of doing that
[19:02] and so is this great
[19:05] nation of ours
[19:08] we come here and on plymouth rock
[19:12] this nation was founded
[19:17] on freedom of religion because our
[19:19] forefathers
[19:20] had fled
[19:24] persecution of the modern
[19:27] jezebel system
[19:31] and had come up and stood many great
[19:33] persecutions and
[19:34] martyrdom under that false system
[19:39] of jezebel and according to the bible of
[19:43] revelations the 13th chapter
[19:45] god had promised them an always
[19:49] and a place for the woman was carried
[19:51] into the wilderness where she was fed
[19:53] for a time time and a dividing account
[19:57] god had made the promise to america
[20:01] or to the church to the woman to
[20:04] come into this country did you know it's
[20:06] revelation 13
[20:07] all the other beasts that come up out of
[20:09] the sea waters
[20:11] revelation 17 17 said the water
[20:14] switch-style sauces thickness and
[20:15] multitudes of people
[20:17] all the other beasts that come up out of
[20:19] water thickness in multitudes of people
[20:21] but when in united states come up
[20:23] it come up out of the earth where there
[20:24] was no people
[20:27] and remember when it come up it looked
[20:29] like
[20:31] a little now lamb lamb has two horns
[20:36] and that's civil and ecclesiastical
[20:39] powers but when they united
[20:41] remember then that lamb spoke like the
[20:44] dragon did before him and the dragon
[20:46] was wrong
[20:49] [Music]
[20:52] when the dragon stood before the woman
[20:53] to devour her child as soon as it was
[20:55] born the red dragon
[20:58] who stood before the woman israel to
[21:01] devour the child as soon as it was born
[21:03] and stood out of persecution killed all
[21:05] the children
[21:06] from two years old down rome
[21:10] the dragon
[21:13] stood at the woman to devour her child
[21:16] as soon as it was born
[21:21] and then we find that this country came
[21:24] up as a freed
[21:25] country and was
[21:30] had a lamb which means the lamb of god
[21:33] but after a while this same system
[21:38] that we have spoke
[21:41] like the dragon and exercised all the
[21:44] power the dragon had before him
[21:51] they parallel one to the other perfectly
[21:56] and remember when these
[22:00] israel came up and took her homeland in
[22:03] palestine
[22:06] drove back all the occupants of that
[22:08] land and possessed the land we came in
[22:10] and took it from the indians
[22:12] drove them back and possessed the land
[22:15] god had a reason for that god was going
[22:19] to show
[22:20] the world what he could do with a a
[22:22] little band of people that wanted
[22:24] freedom
[22:25] and freedom of religion to serve god
[22:29] what did they do for israel he made
[22:32] israel the most
[22:33] mightiest nation in the world and she
[22:36] stayed that way until she got out the
[22:38] will of god
[22:39] what did he do with america he made her
[22:42] the mightiest nation in the world
[22:45] until she's getting out of the will of
[22:47] god
[22:47] [Music]
[22:48] parallel one to the another exactly
[22:52] when israel came over in the land
[22:56] they were a great people because they
[22:58] had great leadership
[23:02] they had god caring man over them
[23:07] such as david king solomon
[23:13] all the world feared him
[23:16] and they enjoyed that privilege of no
[23:19] wars no troubles and living under the
[23:23] power of god
[23:24] until people from all over the knowing
[23:26] world
[23:27] come to see him god gave him a gift of
[23:30] discernment
[23:32] is up on solomon and the queen of the
[23:36] south
[23:37] from queen of sheba came all the way
[23:39] across the sahara desert taking her
[23:41] three months
[23:43] just to hear the wisdom of solomon
[23:45] [Music]
[23:47] and when she saw that solomon could
[23:49] discern spirit
[23:51] and made known to her the secrets in her
[23:53] heart
[23:54] she said all i heard about you was right
[23:56] more besides
[23:58] she was convinced that that was god
[24:04] and america upon the
[24:07] basis of our forefathers who came here
[24:10] for religious freedom
[24:15] we had godly man in them days as leaders
[24:19] george washington abraham lincoln
[24:22] [Music]
[24:24] man of renowned character
[24:27] man of god america was america
[24:32] in those days george washington here at
[24:35] valley forge
[24:37] before he crossed the delaware praying
[24:40] all night
[24:43] until he was wet unto his waist kneeling
[24:46] in snow
[24:49] and the next morning when the americans
[24:52] started to crosses only about 20 percent
[24:54] of them had shoes to wear
[24:56] the american army
[25:00] but they had a principle they had
[25:03] something that they had to fight for
[25:07] they didn't care what comer went the
[25:09] farmers come in
[25:11] stopped his pie and took out his ox and
[25:13] got his life and went to fight for what
[25:15] he know was freedom
[25:20] the next day our biggest four or five
[25:22] bullet
[25:23] holes musket bullets went through his
[25:26] coat hat and never touched thee
[25:30] man of god who founded this nation
[25:33] great man no longer they wrote long
[25:37] may our lands be bright with freedom's
[25:40] holy light
[25:41] protect us by thy might great god our
[25:44] king
[25:49] some time ago i talked to an old man
[25:51] down at cardin indiana
[25:53] he told me about when the capital wasn't
[25:55] cardin and how he
[25:56] said how he went the ox cart down to
[25:58] here that
[26:01] the governor speaking he and the
[26:03] governor's only two had had two pieces
[26:04] of suit on said
[26:05] that he raised the sheep and cheered him
[26:08] and washed them
[26:09] and his sister spun it and made him a
[26:10] coat to go with his trousers
[26:12] the old fella sitting there then of
[26:14] about 85 or 90 years old
[26:16] [Music]
[26:17] pulled his beard like that he said billy
[26:20] that's when i'm married he was american
[26:25] i looked at the old fellow and i thought
[26:27] boy you
[26:29] a lot of these young ones wouldn't
[26:30] believe it but you're telling the truth
[26:34] what happened to israel after all this
[26:37] godly background
[26:41] they began to get carefree
[26:44] they began to get to a place where they
[26:47] well
[26:48] they didn't care what went on they began
[26:51] to
[26:52] go get slack in their worship to god
[26:54] although they
[26:55] held a form of religion
[26:59] just like we had
[27:02] they had a form of godliness but they
[27:05] begin to get
[27:07] free with their people and they begin to
[27:09] bring in
[27:10] different harrises in their church
[27:14] the worship of balaam began to creep in
[27:17] and israel pleasure man
[27:21] drunk
[27:24] and such things as that and finally
[27:28] brought in a leader
[27:31] who didn't know god ahab
[27:36] who succeeded his father and his father
[27:40] was an ungodly man
[27:44] rich man but an ungodly man
[27:48] and he done all the sins more than
[27:51] anyone before him ever done
[27:55] but israel in their drunken stupor
[27:58] [Music]
[28:01] they put a man in like that
[28:05] and put him on the throne to be a ruler
[28:09] over them
[28:12] they thought it was all right just like
[28:15] a lot of americans did today
[28:18] he's a good politician so what
[28:20] difference does it make
[28:23] it won't make any difference because
[28:26] he's a good politician
[28:28] a lot of americans too many
[29:10] catholic
[29:22] the catholic church is on the rise we
[29:24] have had one catholic
[29:26] president and will no doubt have another
[29:28] never dawned upon my heart so much
[29:30] before the
[29:31] the last election and then i think where
[29:34] we were at
[29:35] and so on this i i won't have time in
[29:38] this meeting to tell you in 1933
[29:41] this is a woman's nation it's a number
[29:44] 13.
[29:45] it appears in the 13th chapter of
[29:46] revelation 13 13 5 13
[29:48] everything's in 13 everything is woman
[29:51] and remember
[29:52] thus sayeth the law they'll be a woman
[29:58] she'll either be president vice
[29:59] president or it'll be the catholic
[30:01] church as a woman
[30:02] i see her a great woman a nation vow to
[30:04] her
[30:05] it'll be one before the end time thus
[30:07] saith the lord

[30:10] young if it happens
[30:12] if it isn't i'm a false prophet this day
