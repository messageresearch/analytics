[24:28] on the outside
[24:30] but father we are a people with a
[24:32] promise tonight
[24:33] as we sang a song We Are Standing on the
[24:36] Promises of God
[24:38] and father we pray tonight may you come
[24:40] and bless the ministry of the world
[24:42] Lord may you bless o God not only the
[24:45] speaker but also the hear of the world
[24:47] and father you may be glorified in our
[24:49] midst we love you we bless you we
[24:52] appreciate you tonight
[24:53] for all that you've done for us
[24:55] as Lord is not about choosing but you
[24:57] chosen us Lord
[24:59] before there was a star a molecule or an
[25:01] atom
[25:02] father God ruin your thoughts Lord you
[25:05] are mindful of us o God you need the
[25:07] hour and the day and he knew exactly the
[25:09] word that would restore us o God and
[25:12] bring us back to the place where we
[25:14] belong
[25:15] bless us tonight bless the Menace of
[25:17] your word bless the reading of your word
[25:19] as we ask it in Jesus name amen amen
[25:23] while we are standing let us turn to our
[25:25] Bibles for scripture reading we'll turn
[25:27] to the Book of Genesis chapter 18.
[25:30] verses 1 to 3. and then we'll also read
[25:33] from verses 9 to 15.
[25:35] and we also have a portion of scripture
[25:37] in Job chapter 14 and verse 14.
[25:41] and it also First Corinthians chapter 15
[25:44] also 2 verses 51 to 52
[25:48] and in our last scripture Philippians
[25:50] chapter 3 verses 20 to 21. amen so we'll
[25:55] read our scripture in Genesis Chapter 18
[25:57] verses 1 to 3. and the Lord appeared
[26:01] unto him in the plains of memory
[26:04] and he said in the ten Door In the Heat
[26:07] of the day
[26:08] and lift up his eyes and looked and low
[26:11] three men stood by him and when he saw
[26:15] them he ran to meet them from the tento
[26:18] and bowed himself towards the ground
[26:22] and said my Lord if now I have found
[26:25] favor in thy sight
[26:27] pass not away I pray thee from thy
[26:31] servant let's read from verse 9 to 15.
[26:34] and they said unto him way is thy wife
[26:39] Sarah
[26:40] and he said behold in the tent
[26:44] and he said I will certainly return unto
[26:47] thee according to the time of life
[26:49] and lo theater thy wife shall have a son
[26:52] and Sarah heard it in the ten door which
[26:55] was behind him
[26:57] now Abram and Sarah were well were old
[26:59] and well sleeken in age and it ceased to
[27:02] be with Sarah after the manner of women
[27:06] therefore Sarah laughed with inner self
[27:08] saying after I am wax old shall I have
[27:11] pleasure my Lord being old also and the
[27:15] Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did
[27:18] Sarah
[27:19] love saying
[27:21] so I of assurity be a child which am old
[27:26] is anything too hard for the Lord
[27:30] at the time appointed I will return unto
[27:33] thee according to the time of life
[27:36] and Sarah shall have a son
[27:38] then Sarah denied saying I laughed not
[27:42] for the she was afraid and he said nay
[27:45] but thou
[27:47] ditched love amen she was actually
[27:50] telling God is a liar but it was the
[27:53] absolute truth amen now we're going to
[27:55] read a scripture in Job chapter 14.
[27:58] verse 14
[27:59] There Is Us
[28:02] if a man dies shall he live again
[28:05] all the days of my appointed time will I
[28:09] wait till my change come
[28:13] and then First Corinthians chapter 15
[28:15] verses 51 to 52
[28:18] it reads us
[28:20] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[28:24] all sleep
[28:25] but we shall be changed in a moment in
[28:30] the twinkling of an eye
[28:31] at the last Trump
[28:33] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[28:36] shall be raised Incorruptible and we
[28:39] shall be changed amen and then first and
[28:44] then Philippians chapter 3 verses 20 to
[28:47] 21.
[28:49] It Is Us
[28:50] for our conversation is in heaven
[28:54] from whence also we look for the Savior
[28:57] the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change
[29:01] of our body
[29:03] that it may be fashioned like unto his
[29:06] glorious body
[29:07] according to the working whereby is able
[29:11] even to subdue all things unto himself
[29:16] may the Lord add His blessings the
[29:18] reading of his word you may be seated
[29:21] so tonight
[29:23] from all the scriptures that we read you
[29:25] can order this guess the title of what I
[29:28] was going to speak on tonight the
[29:30] mystery of the change
[29:32] amen
[29:34] so we find brothers and sisters that the
[29:37] Bible speaks nothing
[29:41] of the change
[29:44] of Abram and Sarah
[29:48] it says nothing about them being made
[29:50] young again
[29:53] no one was aware it beside besides Abram
[29:56] and Sarah
[29:58] and they were the ones that met
[30:00] Melchizedek
[30:02] the Bible does not outrightly say their
[30:05] bodies were changed
[30:08] amen it was a mystery
[30:12] but he took the prophet of the seventh
[30:15] seal yes
[30:17] that was the silent seal
[30:21] we can see both Abram and Sarah
[30:25] see he brought out the mystery
[30:28] something that was hidden but not
[30:30] written in the Bible
[30:32] see the so the seventh seal is the
[30:35] silent sea and we can see Brothers this
[30:38] is the message he was the messenger of
[30:40] the unwritten word
[30:43] he could read between the lines
[30:47] it was not written but yet it happened
[30:52] and if we read the unwritten word sounds
[30:55] very strange
[30:57] if we read the unwritten word we can see
[31:00] that both Abram and Sarah they went
[31:03] through a body change
[31:06] so the seventh seal is silent
[31:11] it only says there was silence in heaven
[31:14] for the space of half an hour
[31:18] it says nothing about a body change
[31:22] that the Royal seed of Abram would be
[31:25] visited by Melchizedek
[31:29] God in human flesh
[31:32] as we read in Genesis chapter 18.
[31:35] now these scriptures were all in the
[31:37] Bible but it needed to be made manifest
[31:42] God had to send the message upon the
[31:44] Earth
[31:45] and point to those scriptures as it was
[31:48] in the days of lot so shall it be in the
[31:50] day when the son of man shall be
[31:52] revealed son of man is the word
[31:56] manifested in human flesh
[31:58] we would be visited by God himself
[32:02] and that would be before the rapture
[32:06] so there must be a connection between
[32:09] the silence in heaven and the change
[32:12] that's taking place on the Earth
[32:16] because while that change while
[32:18] Melchizedek visited Abram
[32:21] Sodom and Gomorrah was so continuing on
[32:24] sin was getting worse
[32:27] but the change was happening with Abram
[32:30] and Sarah
[32:32] likewise a change has taken place
[32:35] since the opening of the seals
[32:37] since the appearing of the Lord you know
[32:40] there's the appearing of the Lord and
[32:42] there's the coming of the Lord the
[32:44] appearing is the spirit Revelation he
[32:47] comes in the spirit but the coming of
[32:50] the Lord is the physical that is when
[32:52] the dead shall be raised amen amen from
[32:55] the grave that is the coming of the Lord
[33:00] so we find that sorry muscle going in
[33:03] sin
[33:05] while Abram had a visitation from
[33:07] Melchizedek
[33:09] a change was taking place
[33:11] with Abram and Sarah
[33:13] to meet the promised son
[33:16] likewise in our day
[33:18] we received a message from God
[33:22] the world is growing deeper and deeper
[33:26] in sin
[33:27] but we have received a message that has
[33:30] brought a change
[33:33] amen
[33:34] so in order if you're going to miss the
[33:37] Rapture it's going to be your fault
[33:39] because you have not fed upon the world
[33:42] because it's the very word that
[33:43] melchized expect to them God in human
[33:46] flesh that absolutely changed their
[33:49] bodies from Mortal to immortality
[33:52] amen
[33:54] so what we need for a body change is all
[33:58] in the world
[33:59] that was ministered unto us when God
[34:02] appeared in human flesh at the end time
[34:06] the prophet says that rapturing faith
[34:08] lies in the message
[34:11] so for you to have rapturing faith you
[34:14] must feed upon the word
[34:16] you are feeding in your new body you
[34:18] have changed from the from the Earthly
[34:20] to the Heavenly amen there's a change
[34:23] that's taking place
[34:25] and the world is getting darker and
[34:28] darker
[34:29] sin is getting worse and worse the way
[34:33] people are living is not getting better
[34:35] but yet we are a people with a promise
[34:38] we are the people of the change so we
[34:42] must change as the word unfolds in his
[34:44] Revelation and his manifestation there's
[34:47] no time that we can say now I've got it
[34:49] all and I'm going to stay at home I'm
[34:51] looking at the types no there's a
[34:53] feeling it's taking place and that's why
[34:55] we have
[34:56] the the the the churches that's why you
[34:59] come to the service the five-fold
[35:01] ministry is to feed you upon the word
[35:04] the word is has been said to give us a
[35:07] change Hallelujah so we find that this
[35:11] change started
[35:13] when Melchizedek
[35:15] God in human flesh appears
[35:18] to Abram
[35:21] and what happened to Abram in the Book
[35:23] of Genesis that same thing is going to
[35:25] happen at the end time
[35:28] A change is going to start taking place
[35:30] when Melchizedek comes and appears to
[35:35] the Royal seed of Abram
[35:38] and the question is did
[35:40] it happened according to Genesis chapter
[35:43] 18. I would just like to read a
[35:46] quotation here in the message called
[35:48] perseverance
[35:50] this is what the prophet says let me
[35:53] turn my back
[35:54] you pray
[35:56] the angel that appeared in human flesh
[36:01] so what is he saying that same Angel is
[36:03] now again going to appear in human flesh
[36:07] brother and sister we received a
[36:09] visitation from heaven
[36:12] this was not a visitation from Kentucky
[36:15] from America but God came from the
[36:18] throne and he came
[36:20] that's why Revelations chapter 10
[36:22] brother Branham says Revelations chapter
[36:24] 10 is your seventh seal
[36:27] there was silence in heaven because it's
[36:29] no longer in heaven the activity is now
[36:32] taking faith on Earth
[36:34] I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[36:36] from heaven clothed with a cloud and the
[36:39] rainbow was upon his head and his feet
[36:42] as follows the fire
[36:44] amen and he had in his hand a little
[36:46] book open
[36:48] and he cried as when a lion roared and
[36:51] when he cried seven Thunders uttered
[36:53] their voices
[36:54] and John said I was about to write
[36:57] but then he heard a voice saying seal up
[36:59] those things which the seven Thunders
[37:01] uttered and write them not
[37:03] and the angel which came down raised his
[37:06] hands to heaven and he swore by Heaven
[37:09] that the things that are there in awe
[37:10] and the earth and the things that
[37:12] therein are that there shall be time no
[37:14] longer but in the days of the voice of
[37:18] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[37:20] sound the whole mystery of God shall be
[37:23] finished as he had declared to his
[37:25] sermons the prophets now mystery will be
[37:28] revealed
[37:29] the branches made those seven Thunders a
[37:31] revelation may he show the bride how to
[37:34] prepare for rapturing faith Hallelujah
[37:38] he says the angel appeared in human
[37:40] flesh
[37:42] had his back turned to the tent where
[37:45] Sarah was
[37:47] and he told Sarah what she did is that
[37:50] right
[37:51] that's that same Angel was gone
[37:57] and the same God that was there was
[38:00] promised by Jesus
[38:03] who was God
[38:05] to appear in the last days before the
[38:08] burning of the Earth
[38:10] just like he did in the days of Sodom
[38:14] Hallelujah
[38:16] and then he comes also again in the
[38:17] message who is this Melchizedek
[38:20] he says to my back
[38:23] there's a man sitting behind me he's
[38:26] contacting God
[38:29] and what is he wanting he has got a baby
[38:32] that has got heart trouble
[38:34] and the baby has got a mermaid in his
[38:37] heart so the doctor said amen he even
[38:40] knows what the doctor said you know
[38:42] there's a mummy in the heart amen this
[38:44] is not just a man speaking here this was
[38:46] God hidden behind the man that can look
[38:49] into the man's life and look into the
[38:51] future and brother and sister we are
[38:53] dealing with God yet
[38:55] a change has come Hallelujah he said
[38:59] yeah and that man's name is Mr Cox stand
[39:02] up Mr Cox and he told Sarah what she was
[39:05] thinking behind him Hallelujah so nobody
[39:10] was aware of the change
[39:12] in this day except the brine
[39:16] we know that a change has happened
[39:19] and I believe if we know that the
[39:21] changes happen it will change the way we
[39:23] approach life
[39:25] it will change the way that we aim and
[39:28] live from day to day we are living we
[39:30] are a people with a promise as we're
[39:32] saying tonight Standing on the Promises
[39:34] of God
[39:36] amen so after the Lord made the promise
[39:39] to Abram the change was in process
[39:43] Abram looked at Sarah one day
[39:46] he said honey do you know that your
[39:48] shoulders are straightening up again
[39:51] your hair is becoming black again you as
[39:54] young as what I saw you the first time
[39:57] that I met you
[39:58] and Sarah looked to Abram she said my
[40:01] Lord I notice even at your shoulders are
[40:05] straightening up you are becoming like
[40:07] you were a young man the first time I
[40:09] met you your beard is becoming black
[40:12] your bone patch is disappearing
[40:15] hallelujah what was it it was the change
[40:18] Hallelujah so after the Lord spoke to
[40:21] them drought struck the country
[40:25] they got a camel and they went for 300
[40:28] mile Journey to jira the Bible said
[40:32] brother Branham says what a trip for an
[40:35] old couple
[40:37] he says they must have been changed
[40:42] and I believe that this drought was
[40:44] specifically sent
[40:46] another way of showing that this is not
[40:49] just an old man an old woman that was
[40:51] thinking a 300 mile Journey but to bring
[40:54] out more truth about the changing of
[40:56] their body
[40:57] Hallelujah so the prophet says just wait
[41:01] till we get into our glorified bodies he
[41:04] said it will be marvelous
[41:07] there'll be no sickness there will be no
[41:10] old age there'll be no high blood
[41:12] pressure there will be no
[41:13] disappointments but there will be peace
[41:15] there'll be Joy
[41:17] eternal life Hallelujah I had not seen
[41:20] he had not heard neither has it entered
[41:23] the heart of man what God has in store
[41:26] for those who love him Hallelujah now in
[41:30] Genesis chapter 17 verse 1.
[41:33] God appeared to Abraham
[41:37] excuse me just getting a bit dry
[41:42] he says here
[41:44] and when Abram was 99 years old and nine
[41:49] the Lord appeared to Abraham
[41:53] and said unto him I am the almighty God
[41:57] walk before me and be thou perfect
[42:01] now God appeared in different forms to
[42:05] Abram he appeared in dreams he appeared
[42:08] in Visions but we find in Genesis
[42:11] chapter 18.
[42:13] the Lord appeared to Abram in human
[42:16] flesh
[42:19] see as we read in the scripture earlier
[42:22] on
[42:23] and we find that the prophet
[42:25] identifies those three men again here at
[42:29] the end time
[42:31] he says one is Billy Graham
[42:35] the other one is all Roberts and the
[42:38] other one whose name has seven letters
[42:41] and ends with h-a-m
[42:43] amen he wants you to get a revelation
[42:46] amen that is Branham hallelujah amen so
[42:51] the other two are angels but the one was
[42:54] Elohim
[42:55] father Brandon was an Elohim but if God
[42:58] used that vessel
[42:59] to speak through
[43:01] to manifest the promise of this day so
[43:04] he's finding Genesis 19 is the
[43:06] destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
[43:11] and in Genesis 20 verses 1 to 2 Abram
[43:15] and Sarah
[43:16] went through a body change
[43:18] to meet the promised son
[43:21] right
[43:22] now if we want to read it hypothetically
[43:26] let's see or supposedly
[43:29] after grandma
[43:31] and grandpa with his long beard and
[43:35] Grandma Sarah with a little cap with a
[43:38] shawl over shoulder got to Gerald
[43:42] amen
[43:44] but it wasn't girl Grandma and Grandpa
[43:46] this is what brother Branham says we
[43:49] know immediately after that
[43:51] they took a little trip went down to
[43:53] Jerome
[43:54] is that right
[43:56] measure it on your map
[43:58] 300 and something Miles by camel
[44:02] he says quite a trip for an old couple
[44:04] like that
[44:06] Grandma here a little stick with a show
[44:11] and here she comes and Abram
[44:14] 300 and something miles down to Jerome
[44:18] is that right the Bible says they went
[44:21] down there
[44:22] and you know the strange thing it was
[44:24] after little grandma
[44:26] and them coming down
[44:28] they
[44:29] and the great great grandpa Abraham long
[44:33] white beard an old grandma with this
[44:37] little shawl on her the king Gerald was
[44:40] looking for a sweetheart
[44:42] imagine old mother come here and he was
[44:46] looking for a sweetheart
[44:48] all those beautiful women down there but
[44:51] when he seen Sarah he says there's the
[44:54] one that I want
[44:56] see
[44:57] little grandma with a shawl over the
[45:00] shoulder the most beautiful thing in the
[45:03] world
[45:04] the prophet says ridiculous nonsense
[45:08] she wasn't a little grandma
[45:11] God turned her back to a young beautiful
[45:15] woman again
[45:18] now listen
[45:20] that's what he's going to do to every
[45:22] one of you in the rapture
[45:25] there's going to be no old people in the
[45:27] rapture amen this is the last time
[45:30] you'll see Gray
[45:31] next time you see me it will all be
[45:33] black it'll be a young man again amen
[45:37] now precious brother amen you'll be
[45:39] young amen young man in the rapture
[45:42] Hallelujah can you imagine the king with
[45:45] all those beautiful women around him
[45:48] but when he saw Sarah he says that is
[45:51] the one that I've been waiting for all
[45:54] of my life little grandma
[45:57] by the brand name says no she was pretty
[46:00] God turned back to about well the
[46:03] prophet says about 25 years old again
[46:07] Abram to a sturdy young man again
[46:12] now in Genesis
[46:14] 20 was one
[46:16] see
[46:19] it says here after after the change and
[46:21] Abram said to
[46:22] uh of Sarah his wife she's my sister
[46:27] and a baby like the king of Gerard sent
[46:30] and took Sarah
[46:32] now why did he take Sarah
[46:35] he wanted to marry her
[46:38] because we find that a few chapters
[46:40] before that Sarah was a beautiful young
[46:44] woman
[46:45] and Abram lied when he went to Egypt
[46:49] to tell the king of souls that Abram was
[46:51] very fond of Lies I think it was his
[46:53] weak spot he told the world right twice
[46:56] the first time when Sarah was young and
[46:58] after the body changed he told the LIE
[47:00] again
[47:01] amen that's Father Abraham that doesn't
[47:04] mean you're gonna lie amen see so Sarah
[47:07] was changed back to a former Beauty
[47:10] she did not only have a facelift you
[47:13] know a makeover as we call it nowadays
[47:16] she was absolutely changed amen she also
[47:20] was made fruitful she was made fertile
[47:24] Hallelujah
[47:26] amen Sarah was changed back to a brand
[47:30] new young beautiful woman again
[47:34] Not only was she made beautiful but also
[47:38] fruitful
[47:39] she was made fertile because Abram was
[47:42] living with her from the age of 18. and
[47:46] for all those years they could not have
[47:48] a baby
[47:49] but here were the body change
[47:51] God gave her a brand new body
[47:55] so much that the king of giraffe fell in
[47:58] love with her
[47:59] the prophet says he makes a statement
[48:01] don't use some of this year manicure you
[48:06] put on your lips
[48:08] or whatever it is you don't need that
[48:12] you don't need that you need Jesus
[48:17] he'll put her there permanently so what
[48:20] they are painting on there you're going
[48:22] to have a permanent Beauty
[48:23] you want the red cheeks you have
[48:25] permanent red chicks you want red lips
[48:27] you can have permanent red lips not by
[48:29] manicure but by Jesus changing you
[48:33] making you what you want to be amen he
[48:36] says hallelujah that's right don't
[48:39] Fashion After Hollywood out there
[48:42] Fashion After heaven that's what you
[48:46] want to do
[48:48] that's why our sisters they dress
[48:50] differently
[48:51] they talk differently our brothers they
[48:54] behave differently why they fashion of
[48:57] the heaven we have a Heavenly influence
[49:00] remember in the preview of the Bride
[49:03] the angel shall brother Branham she's
[49:05] coming to preview and how that bride was
[49:08] dressed you know the hair was uncut she
[49:11] was dressed as she would according to
[49:14] the word and she was marching according
[49:16] to the tune of the word
[49:18] brother Branham actually had a a vision
[49:21] of what this bride will look like
[49:24] because remember after you saw that
[49:25] first bride then he saw the American
[49:27] bride you saw all the different brides
[49:29] and you know he became so sick he said
[49:32] after all the ministry after all the
[49:34] demonstration of the Holy Ghost in the
[49:36] different areas he went throughout
[49:38] America and this is what the ministry
[49:40] could produce and he says you almost
[49:42] fainted
[49:44] but that the angel said the bride must
[49:47] come into preview again
[49:49] and as that first bride the second bride
[49:52] was exactly the same
[49:54] so brother and sister God has given us a
[49:56] pattern how we ought to dress
[49:59] he's absolutely giving us the the
[50:02] requirements to be in that bride
[50:06] to be a part of the Bride if we do not
[50:09] match up to that vision of the Prophet
[50:11] then we are not in the bride that's why
[50:15] he's given us sisters this is the way
[50:17] you dress Brothers this is the way you
[50:19] cut your hair this is where you do that
[50:21] why he's preparing you for that Heavenly
[50:25] March from Earth to Glory
[50:27] Hallelujah and that's the way we want to
[50:29] dress that's the way we want to conduct
[50:32] ourselves amen and the Bible says the
[50:35] king took Sarah
[50:36] and he was going to marry her
[50:39] he was going to prepare her for marriage
[50:42] as the prophet dramatizes he says that
[50:44] night he took his bath
[50:46] laid on his bed stretched out his big
[50:49] feet upon the bed and he said Lord I'm
[50:52] so happy you gave me a pretty girl
[50:56] ignorant of the fact that this was
[50:59] another man's wife
[51:01] but this King was a righteous man
[51:04] and what God did was that while he slept
[51:06] he came to him in a dream and said you
[51:10] are as good as a dead man
[51:13] and he said Lord why am I as good as a
[51:16] dead man
[51:17] he said you got another man's wife out
[51:20] there
[51:21] what was God doing he was protecting the
[51:24] bloodstream of the royal seed
[51:27] Jesus Christ was to come through their
[51:29] bloodstream there could be no
[51:31] contamination in that bloodstream as Eve
[51:35] contaminated it in the Garden of Eden so
[51:38] God protects the Covenant people
[51:43] we just commit ourselves to him then he
[51:47] takes care of the rest remember he told
[51:50] Sarah I'll be a God to you and your seed
[51:53] after you in their Generations you
[51:57] promise to be Only a God to the seed of
[51:59] Abram that's why the message at the end
[52:02] time amen it's a message to the seed of
[52:06] Abram
[52:07] amen say a seat of Abram receive your
[52:10] lost sign amen that's why when it comes
[52:13] in Revelation 10 he comes as the
[52:15] Covenant angel
[52:17] amen is coming for the Covenant people
[52:21] those who are a part of him who are part
[52:24] of the Covenant God made with Abram in
[52:27] the Book of Genesis because brother
[52:29] Branham says that had faith that Abram
[52:31] had was absolutely the faith for Jesus
[52:35] Christ that was the actual son that he
[52:37] was believing too and he says that that
[52:39] Faith was the faith to unite spirit and
[52:43] flesh together
[52:44] and on the River Jordan the Holocaust
[52:47] came down and settled Upon Jesus amen
[52:50] and he went to Calvary
[52:52] to die for the sins amen of the world
[52:55] for his City when you pay the price of
[52:58] redemption and on their Pentecost amen
[53:02] that Pillar of Fire came back
[53:04] Hallelujah and it came to indwell many
[53:07] bodies
[53:08] Hallelujah as a deed the first one
[53:11] because now they were Sanctified by the
[53:13] blood of Jesus so the spirit and flesh
[53:17] could unite together
[53:19] Hallelujah and for 2 000 years the Holy
[53:23] Ghost was bound by denominational trees
[53:25] and dogmas amen and after 2 000 years
[53:28] the pillar of fire came back
[53:31] Hallelujah to turn the heart of the
[53:33] children to the faith of the fathers so
[53:36] that the spirit and flesh could unite
[53:38] together again
[53:40] Hallelujah that's why that return that
[53:43] Restorations could not take place unless
[53:46] the polar fire returned
[53:49] amen so that flesh that's why we have a
[53:51] message the uniting of the Heavenly
[53:54] bridegroom and the Earthly bride amen
[53:57] not the paint to the blood the the
[53:59] baptism that Pentecost had you see they
[54:01] had the restoration of the gifts but
[54:03] this is the very person of the Holy
[54:05] Ghost Christ uniting himself with his
[54:09] bride they are no longer trained but
[54:11] they are one Hallelujah flesh of his
[54:15] flesh Spirit of his Spirit life of his
[54:19] life she is him
[54:21] Hallelujah if he was the word made flesh
[54:24] she is the word made rest tonight
[54:27] Hallelujah
[54:29] Amen to the hearts of the children had
[54:32] been turned back that's why it says the
[54:34] messenger of Malachi 4 has gone to be do
[54:37] two things reveal the mystery of the
[54:40] Thunders amen turn the hearts of the
[54:42] children to the faith of the fathers and
[54:45] these divinely revealed truths will
[54:49] literally turn the hearts of the
[54:51] children to the faith of the father
[54:54] hallelujah hallelujah this is a great
[54:57] message brother and sister amen is not a
[55:00] lot of knowledge whatever it's a reality
[55:02] it's a life Christ in you the hope of
[55:06] glory amen amen so we find brother and
[55:10] sister how that God came to the king
[55:14] and God said I know the Integrity of
[55:17] your heart
[55:19] amen and that's why I kept you from
[55:23] sinning
[55:26] and God said I know you're a good man
[55:29] I know that you are a righteous man
[55:32] and everything but I'll not hear your
[55:36] prayer
[55:37] a holy man a religious man
[55:40] but God would not hear his prayer why is
[55:44] it because he was not according to the
[55:47] seed of promise to Abram he was not part
[55:50] of the Covenant so he could not pray
[55:53] amen for Abram he said but you go to my
[55:57] Covenant servant go to Abram and let him
[56:01] pray for you the guy that just told the
[56:03] LIE let him pray for you because that is
[56:06] an unconditional Covenant Hallelujah a
[56:09] God-fearing man but God refused to
[56:12] listen to his prayer Hallelujah he says
[56:16] my husband is my Prophet he's a liar
[56:19] he's backsled but let him pray for you
[56:22] Hallelujah it shows how they go how much
[56:24] God thinks of those people who are in
[56:27] the Covenant who are part of the
[56:29] Covenant whose names were written in the
[56:32] Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah the
[56:34] prophet says people who think they've
[56:36] done wrong
[56:38] that the Lord won't heal them
[56:40] he says God's going to condemn them
[56:43] that's how you feel maybe you made a
[56:45] mistake and you feel look I'm out of it
[56:48] I'm no longer bride I'm no longer that
[56:51] he says maybe you backslid
[56:53] the prophecies repent for what you've
[56:56] done
[56:57] that don't mean that God has forsaken
[57:00] you repent and go on
[57:03] and I believe with only the bride that
[57:05] can repent
[57:06] Hallelujah
[57:08] in the unconditional Covenant he says
[57:11] now a righteous man done nothing but he
[57:15] wasn't the Seed of Abraham
[57:18] so when you pray you are the seed of
[57:20] Abram God hears your prayer
[57:25] they shall recover in my name he shall
[57:28] cast our devil you know your position in
[57:31] Christ you know who you are I am the
[57:33] seed of Abram and His blessings rest
[57:35] upon you tonight Hallelujah he says here
[57:39] he didn't he he had no promise
[57:43] he didn't uh a good man a God-fearing
[57:47] man laying there on his bed and God
[57:50] refused to hear his prayer
[57:54] Hallelujah he says why God made his
[57:57] promise unconditional to Abraham
[58:01] so you might feel tonight I'm a
[58:03] predestinated seed
[58:05] you know I cannot just live anywhere I
[58:07] want to I can sin and go on I'm a
[58:12] predestinator many people they go with
[58:14] that idea but listen to what the prophet
[58:16] says here
[58:17] don't give you permission to sin
[58:21] remember that
[58:23] what I'm trying to get is to get the
[58:25] fear knocked out of you
[58:28] you're always scared about something
[58:29] don't be scared God has promised
[58:33] God has got to do with it
[58:36] if you believe it if you are the seed of
[58:38] Abram someone said to me
[58:41] like my Baptist friend used to say what
[58:43] difference does it make
[58:45] the one that went into eternal security
[58:49] amen so she can go for an Alum or
[58:52] eternal security I'm a Child of God once
[58:56] a son always a son but there are fruits
[58:59] that you are of your sonship amen you
[59:02] see he said why don't they make it
[59:04] different to me I'm saved glory to God I
[59:07] can do what I want to
[59:09] the prophet says that just shows that
[59:12] you are not saved
[59:13] that's right
[59:15] if you are saved you don't want to do
[59:18] those things
[59:19] that's right
[59:21] he says those things such as dancing
[59:23] playing cards and playing and bobbing
[59:26] your hair and painting your lips and
[59:28] manicuring your face in all kinds is the
[59:31] attributes of unbelief
[59:34] that hurts Pentecost
[59:36] but that's what's good for you brother
[59:39] that's right couldn't walk the old
[59:41] straight narrow path
[59:43] just like a hog going to its wallow and
[59:46] a dog to his vomit that's where the
[59:48] Pentecost church has returned
[59:52] Hallelujah so there's a life to live
[59:55] when you are the seed of Abram
[59:57] he says all right brother if you are
[1:00:00] born again the spirit of God will bear
[1:00:03] record that them things are wrong you
[1:00:06] see it brings conviction
[1:00:08] and if there's no conviction shows
[1:00:10] there's no spirit
[1:00:11] the spirit tells you it's wrong
[1:00:14] don't do it but if there is no Spirit
[1:00:16] you do it and you feel nothing about it
[1:00:19] amen so we take warning from the message
[1:00:23] of the hour
[1:00:24] amen you see you know that's true and
[1:00:27] Here Comes Your latter rain the scatter
[1:00:29] rain whatever it was and call the
[1:00:31] liberation of women
[1:00:34] and everything like that it's a disgrace
[1:00:36] the prophet says it's the works of the
[1:00:39] devil
[1:00:41] you ain't going to love me after tonight
[1:00:43] amen I'm sure you're still going to love
[1:00:45] me after tonight amen
[1:00:48] amen you ain't going to love me after
[1:00:50] that but brother when I meet you at the
[1:00:53] Judgment bar I'm going to clean off that
[1:00:56] thing that's one thing sure I'm going to
[1:00:59] tell you the truth about it amen the
[1:01:01] word means so be it
[1:01:04] so God told Abram not to leave Palestine
[1:01:10] now any person that disobeys the word of
[1:01:14] God is vaccine
[1:01:16] you know you must not do it but you want
[1:01:18] to do it anyhow
[1:01:20] and any person who leaves the promised
[1:01:22] land of the son of man is backstory
[1:01:26] now the son of man renews the message of
[1:01:28] the hour you leave the message your
[1:01:30] backside you may go join the Baptist you
[1:01:33] may join Pentecost you may join anybody
[1:01:36] but your Bachelor this is the way this
[1:01:40] is the truth and this is the life
[1:01:43] amen so we find that because of the
[1:01:46] drought instead of Abram facing the
[1:01:49] music
[1:01:50] as he believed for the promised son he
[1:01:52] could believe that God he could give him
[1:01:53] also some food and provide for him but
[1:01:56] he went to Egypt he did exactly what God
[1:02:00] told him not to do
[1:02:02] he was backslidden in his new body
[1:02:06] amen but we know that body got old and
[1:02:08] it had to be buried and so amen but when
[1:02:11] we get in our new body
[1:02:14] amen that's our body
[1:02:16] eternally Amy concerning that body
[1:02:19] Hallelujah but God couldn't turn down
[1:02:22] his child
[1:02:23] he made an unconditional Covenant with
[1:02:27] Abram remember Adam failed and God
[1:02:29] started all over
[1:02:31] with
[1:02:33] Abraham
[1:02:34] Hallelujah and he says this is my
[1:02:37] Prophet take his wife to him if you
[1:02:39] don't you are as good as a dead man and
[1:02:41] that he pray for you not the holier than
[1:02:44] thou priest
[1:02:46] but my Prophet sitting setting out there
[1:02:48] the one that just told a lie and the
[1:02:52] prophecy is that's the grace of God to
[1:02:55] the Holy Ghost Church
[1:02:57] amen he says and you don't recognize it
[1:03:02] the Covenant that God made with Abram
[1:03:04] and his seed after him so you are
[1:03:08] included in the Covenant that God made
[1:03:11] with Abram
[1:03:13] he says we don't deserve healing
[1:03:16] he says every one of us deserves to die
[1:03:21] there's none of us that deserves the
[1:03:24] gospel
[1:03:25] there's not one of us that deserves the
[1:03:27] grace of Jesus Christ
[1:03:30] we don't even deserve to live on Earth
[1:03:34] we don't even deserve to look at God's
[1:03:37] creation
[1:03:39] but God made a covenant with Abram
[1:03:43] and we are a part of that Covenant amen
[1:03:47] that's Abram and his seat after him
[1:03:50] healing belongs to us
[1:03:53] the Holy Ghost belongs to us
[1:03:56] salvation belongs to us Heaven belongs
[1:04:01] to us we are sitting in Heavenly places
[1:04:04] tonight because of a covenant that God
[1:04:07] made with Abram I'll be a God to you and
[1:04:10] your seed after them in their generation
[1:04:13] amen and what God did you Abram and
[1:04:17] Sarah that's what's going to do to the
[1:04:20] Covenant seed at the end time
[1:04:22] whatever he did there he visited Abram
[1:04:25] and said
[1:04:26] Melchizedek and at the end time he comes
[1:04:29] again and he visits the Royal seed of
[1:04:31] Abram
[1:04:32] and he preaches the message who is this
[1:04:35] Melchizedek
[1:04:37] Hallelujah let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:04:39] praise tonight amen
[1:04:42] so the last sign before the change come
[1:04:47] he appeared in human flesh
[1:04:51] that was the beginning of the change
[1:04:54] so when Melchizedek appeared to us
[1:04:58] that was the beginning of the change
[1:05:01] for the rapturing of the church
[1:05:03] the world is located on but a change has
[1:05:07] come
[1:05:08] we are living in that change
[1:05:11] Hallelujah that was the mystery of the
[1:05:15] change
[1:05:15] this is what the prophet says here and
[1:05:17] feast of the trumpets
[1:05:19] God changed her body
[1:05:22] he turned them back
[1:05:25] he says it's a mystery
[1:05:28] to be revealed now in this day by the
[1:05:32] son of man
[1:05:33] who's the son of man the word in flesh
[1:05:36] who's the word the logos Christ in human
[1:05:41] flesh
[1:05:42] Hallelujah the evening message see turn
[1:05:46] back
[1:05:47] and that was the last sign they seen
[1:05:50] that discernment before the change of
[1:05:54] the body come
[1:05:56] brother Brian says are we looking
[1:05:58] looking down the street is it happening
[1:06:00] at the moment you know I've come to a
[1:06:02] place I look in the mirror is there any
[1:06:04] change
[1:06:05] you know I used to count the white ones
[1:06:09] you know the gray is but now I've got to
[1:06:12] count the black black ones the black is
[1:06:15] in my head amen there is a change a
[1:06:18] promise to the seed of Abram
[1:06:21] he says that before we can ever receive
[1:06:24] the Sun what happens
[1:06:26] The Trumpet Of God shall sound
[1:06:29] the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:06:32] a new body
[1:06:34] and we which are alive and remain shall
[1:06:37] be changed in a moment in the twinkling
[1:06:40] of an eye Hallelujah and shall be caught
[1:06:43] up together to meet the Lord in the end
[1:06:47] the prophet says the secret has been
[1:06:49] made known
[1:06:50] the seals are open
[1:06:54] the trumpet sounds for the Israel the
[1:06:57] two prophets is ready to appear what is
[1:07:00] it the church must get off the scene
[1:07:03] right now
[1:07:04] so they can appear
[1:07:07] he can't deal with two at the same time
[1:07:10] he never did Hallelujah
[1:07:13] he said in Jehovah Jireh and that's the
[1:07:16] next thing in order for the church
[1:07:19] not a great revivals and you know
[1:07:21] something new comes and with a new
[1:07:24] revelation whatever
[1:07:26] the new thing is the the thing to follow
[1:07:29] is the changing of the body
[1:07:32] and the secret lies in the message of
[1:07:34] the hour
[1:07:35] not somebody coming out but
[1:07:38] it's in the message Hallelujah that's
[1:07:40] why tonight I'm reading from the message
[1:07:43] not my thoughts but it's what the
[1:07:45] propheter said he says say what it saves
[1:07:48] says she's not me speaking it's him he's
[1:07:52] the one that's doing the talking so if
[1:07:54] you did do what he says you're a
[1:07:55] candidate for rapturing Faith amen he
[1:07:59] says here we which are alive in the
[1:08:01] remains of the coming of the Lord shall
[1:08:02] we prevent them which are to sleep for
[1:08:04] we shall be changed in a moment to
[1:08:07] receive the promised son
[1:08:08] where is he going to come down here on
[1:08:11] Earth no up in the air we don't meet him
[1:08:14] on Earth and we couldn't meet him in
[1:08:17] these kind of bodies we've got to be
[1:08:19] changed to meet him in the air
[1:08:22] I really oh I really feel religious the
[1:08:25] prophet says the body will be changed in
[1:08:28] a moment in the twinkling of an eye if
[1:08:30] ever so many times used to kill your eye
[1:08:33] amen you don't even notice it
[1:08:35] twinkle it you don't even see it now
[1:08:37] that's how quickly your body is going to
[1:08:38] be changed the province is going to be a
[1:08:40] sweep
[1:08:41] and your body's changed it's all over
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:45] and we shall be caught up together to
[1:08:47] meet the Lord so the prophet says the
[1:08:49] next thing to the seed of Abram
[1:08:52] they are getting their last sign
[1:08:55] see how he addresses us now the next
[1:08:57] thing to the seed of Abram they are
[1:09:01] getting their last sign
[1:09:03] a discernment just like it was Jesus day
[1:09:07] that's the last sign to the church
[1:09:12] he says in Abram's Grace Covenant what's
[1:09:15] the next thing after the sign goes away
[1:09:18] God's going to condition Abram's
[1:09:22] children now I believe that the prophet
[1:09:24] spoke words inspired by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:28] so I thought as I will look up what does
[1:09:30] the word condition mean
[1:09:33] because he says here God's going to
[1:09:34] condition Abram's children it means to
[1:09:38] bring something into the desired state
[1:09:41] for youth
[1:09:43] so he's given us a message
[1:09:46] to bring us in the desired state for a
[1:09:49] body change
[1:09:50] to the Royal seed of Abram
[1:09:53] the secret lies in the message
[1:09:56] the secret to change your body it's in
[1:09:59] the message of the hour
[1:10:01] he says getting ready to receive the
[1:10:05] promised son so every time you come to
[1:10:09] church you're coming for conditioning
[1:10:12] amen preparation for a body change to
[1:10:17] meet the promised son
[1:10:18] how are we going to receive him we can't
[1:10:21] receive him in these bodies we are going
[1:10:24] to meet him in the air praise God
[1:10:25] forever the trumpet shall sound the
[1:10:27] daring Christ shall rise and we'll go up
[1:10:29] to meet him what's he doing the last
[1:10:32] sign before the Transfiguration the last
[1:10:35] sign before the rapture
[1:10:38] for most every time the atomic bombs are
[1:10:41] going to destroy the world
[1:10:44] this marriage is always current
[1:10:46] we are living in the time
[1:10:49] where they are speaking about the
[1:10:50] dropping of atomic bombs
[1:10:52] Russia's got a whole arsenal of atomic
[1:10:55] bombs he's got the most of all of them
[1:10:58] so I was thinking now if she runs out of
[1:10:59] all her planes and you know helicopters
[1:11:03] and her tanks she's only got atomic
[1:11:05] bombs left
[1:11:06] so what's he going to do to defend
[1:11:07] yourself and then the message God called
[1:11:10] man
[1:11:11] brother Branham says America you've got
[1:11:14] a bomb Russell's got a bomb with your
[1:11:16] name on it and it's pointing in this
[1:11:19] direction and it's only going to take a
[1:11:21] few seconds and everything will be wiped
[1:11:23] off
[1:11:24] brother and sister we are living in
[1:11:26] serious times but God has given us a
[1:11:28] promise of a body change he says before
[1:11:31] the first atomic bomb strikes the Earth
[1:11:33] the bride will be raptured into Glory
[1:11:35] Hallelujah
[1:11:37] he says your Jesus is coming
[1:11:41] which we which are alive and remain
[1:11:43] shall not prevent thee Oh hinder those
[1:11:45] that are asleep for the trumpet of God
[1:11:48] shall sound the daring Christ shall rise
[1:11:51] he says we which are alive shall be
[1:11:53] changed in a moment
[1:11:54] an old man will be young
[1:11:57] an old woman will be young again
[1:12:00] and once again he uses the same word
[1:12:02] and we'll be conditioned to meet the
[1:12:06] promised coming son
[1:12:09] amen we thank God for the conditioning
[1:12:12] amen I think our ladies know what
[1:12:14] conditioning is amen
[1:12:16] you get it in a nice condition
[1:12:19] and now that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:12:21] doing with the message he's conditioning
[1:12:23] us
[1:12:23] getting us ready fifth for rapturing
[1:12:26] Faith for a body to be changed in a
[1:12:28] moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:12:31] he says to meet the promised son
[1:12:33] Glory Hallelujah the next thing in God's
[1:12:37] order what happens
[1:12:39] just as the angel had his back turned
[1:12:42] and showing that the sign to Abram he
[1:12:45] brought everything down to justification
[1:12:48] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:51] Ghost placing of sons and gifts and
[1:12:54] orders coming out then showing his last
[1:12:57] sign Before Destruction
[1:12:59] and then he changed Abram's seed it
[1:13:02] might come before he closes the meeting
[1:13:05] tonight
[1:13:06] I mean you might be walking him into
[1:13:08] your car and you'll be changed
[1:13:10] I just heard about it it's happened it
[1:13:13] could happen at any moment
[1:13:15] amen is coming soon he's coming soon I
[1:13:18] know my Lord is coming soon maybe night
[1:13:21] or noon but I know my Lord is coming
[1:13:24] soon Hallelujah we are living with that
[1:13:28] expectation
[1:13:29] he says yeah we'll become young woman
[1:13:32] again
[1:13:33] change why do we have to change it was
[1:13:35] totally impossible for that old man to
[1:13:38] have a sexual relationship with his wife
[1:13:41] it was totally impossible for her to
[1:13:43] conceive and to be a child if the
[1:13:46] supernatural taking place and the only
[1:13:48] way it can be done would be have to be a
[1:13:52] Transfiguration
[1:13:54] amen do you love the Lord tonight amen
[1:13:57] now I'm going to skip a lot of
[1:13:59] quotations and the time is catching up
[1:14:01] with us
[1:14:02] I would like to read a quotation to the
[1:14:04] final one okay here's one I don't want
[1:14:06] to skip this one he says the lady
[1:14:09] sitting next to her right next to her
[1:14:11] day She's suffering with varicose veins
[1:14:15] she has something wrong inwardly it's a
[1:14:18] bladder trouble she has bladder trouble
[1:14:20] she's also from Kansas City Mrs Gray
[1:14:23] I'm a total stranger to you raise up and
[1:14:26] raise your hands like that
[1:14:27] I mean to these people here that was
[1:14:30] called raise up your hand you people
[1:14:32] that's just called in if I'm a stranger
[1:14:35] what is it the same God who came down in
[1:14:40] human flesh
[1:14:41] and eat meat and drink milk and Jesus
[1:14:44] said and Abram said rather that Elohim
[1:14:48] God
[1:14:49] manifested in flesh you know we don't
[1:14:52] treat God here only but God came and he
[1:14:55] came in our Mercy the god of the Bible
[1:14:57] became a reality through the message of
[1:15:00] the hour
[1:15:01] Hallelujah and Jesus said Abram said yes
[1:15:05] it was in the days of Jehovah the son of
[1:15:08] man again in the form of prophetic like
[1:15:10] he was would he turned again in the last
[1:15:12] days just before your bodies are going
[1:15:16] to be changed he comes himself the Lord
[1:15:19] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:15:22] shout
[1:15:23] with the voice of the Archangel and the
[1:15:25] Trump
[1:15:26] he says the shout is the loving bread of
[1:15:29] life bringing forth a bride Hallelujah
[1:15:33] so she partakes of the word the living
[1:15:35] bridge and now she manifests herself as
[1:15:37] the Bride of Jesus Christ he becomes the
[1:15:41] word
[1:15:42] he says here okay this is the last one
[1:15:45] then we'll close
[1:15:47] he says the first conscience controls
[1:15:49] the body
[1:15:51] smelling here
[1:15:52] and that's just got all these scrupled
[1:15:55] up we reason and everything else
[1:15:58] but that new body comes from the bone
[1:16:01] again
[1:16:03] not the first conscious it will pass
[1:16:06] away
[1:16:06] it's that inside something that lives
[1:16:10] see it's something inside there
[1:16:13] that lives
[1:16:14] and you are aware of it amen
[1:16:17] he says here amen it's not this outside
[1:16:22] sea tasteful smell and hear
[1:16:25] it isn't it's subject to death and will
[1:16:29] die
[1:16:30] but the inside part of you
[1:16:33] down in here on the inside that is the
[1:16:37] person that cannot die
[1:16:40] see and that's the person that the New
[1:16:43] Life Starts from
[1:16:45] from this new birth and it builds
[1:16:48] another person in the image of this
[1:16:51] person
[1:16:52] around that life you get it
[1:16:55] so potentially it's in here
[1:16:59] the Rapture is already in process in you
[1:17:03] because of the attribute of God that now
[1:17:05] has become manifested within you you are
[1:17:09] walking around with the secrets of the
[1:17:11] Rapture you are walking with God in you
[1:17:14] that seed of God has become quickened to
[1:17:17] you he says there's therefore now no
[1:17:19] condemnation to those that are in Christ
[1:17:21] they walked up after the flesh but after
[1:17:23] the spirit brother Branham says that
[1:17:25] spirit is nothing in the world but that
[1:17:28] seed word made manifest Made Alive
[1:17:32] Quicken amen that part that was in the
[1:17:35] land's book of life has now become
[1:17:37] manifested in you amen that's why the
[1:17:40] beast at the end time he deceives
[1:17:42] everyone
[1:17:44] whose names were not written in the
[1:17:46] Lamb's Book of Life slain from the
[1:17:49] foundation of the world hallelujah oh
[1:17:51] for the grace of God brother and sister
[1:17:53] we thank God for the message of the hour
[1:17:55] he may think so so simple so clear that
[1:17:58] we can understand who we are we can
[1:18:01] understand we got the revelation of
[1:18:03] where we belong our father is God that's
[1:18:06] why he says when you when you want to
[1:18:08] pray you pray Our Father who art in
[1:18:10] heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[1:18:13] come thy will be done in earth as it is
[1:18:16] in heaven Hallelujah
[1:18:19] he says the word promised before the
[1:18:22] foundation of the world and around there
[1:18:25] this only reflects the negative
[1:18:28] that will reflect the positive the word
[1:18:31] what is that word is that attribute that
[1:18:35] was in him
[1:18:36] before there was a star a molecule or an
[1:18:39] atom God knew about you amen now that
[1:18:43] has become reality that's why we knew he
[1:18:45] said my sheep they know my voice
[1:18:48] why does the Sheep know the voice
[1:18:50] because they were a part of him when he
[1:18:53] speaks the Sheep recognizes because they
[1:18:55] are a part of that nature a part of him
[1:18:57] they were a part of his being Hallelujah
[1:19:00] is another sermon but really with some
[1:19:03] other time
[1:19:04] about the Melchizedek order amen see and
[1:19:09] the same thing or the translation of the
[1:19:11] Bride will be the same thing the word
[1:19:14] that's in you
[1:19:16] the body will materialize around that
[1:19:19] word the same thing it did by Sarah
[1:19:23] and where did she get that word from
[1:19:24] Melchizedek
[1:19:26] amen so heaven was silent there was
[1:19:29] nobody in heaven he came and took part
[1:19:31] of the body of William Branham amen and
[1:19:34] he started serving the seeds of rapture
[1:19:36] seized to to manifest a bride at the end
[1:19:39] time the Revelation for rapturing Faith

[1:19:52] Cox amen God we haven't received a
[1:19:55] visitation from God himself

[1:20:03] wherever you are there's a presence that
[1:20:06] goes with you amen within service you
[1:20:09] create that atmosphere we know alone in
[1:20:12] your car you just feel that presence why
[1:20:14] is because of the little drop of Heaven
[1:20:17] that's inside of there that can create
[1:20:19] an atmosphere amen that's why he says if
[1:20:22] you say to this mountain be moved and
[1:20:25] don't doubt but believe whatever you say
[1:20:27] you can have whatever you say hallelujah
[1:20:31] he says when an old body that you had
[1:20:35] that first body it had to be changed in
[1:20:38] order to produce a sun you get it that
[1:20:41] body could not do it
[1:20:43] this body cannot do it so it'll have to
[1:20:47] be changed the same way to receive the
[1:20:50] Sun
[1:20:51] though the secret of the change has been
[1:20:54] made known to us rather than sister we

[1:30:19] praise the lord we want to thank the
[1:30:21] Lord tonight
[1:30:22] we want to thank the Lord tonight our
[1:30:26] The Mystery of the change
[1:30:29] praise the Lord
[1:30:32] I sure believe there was a
[1:30:35] beautiful talk tonight
[1:30:37] that the Holy Spirit choose to
[1:30:39] fellowship with us around and and uh
[1:30:44] last Sunday brother Freddie was speaking
[1:30:47] on
[1:30:49] things around uniting signing time and
[1:30:53] uh
[1:30:54] and
[1:30:56] our dear brother just moved in our same
[1:30:58] direction tonight and uh
[1:31:02] I believe that if you're paying
[1:31:03] attention you could see the uh
[1:31:07] uh the same thought of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:09] removing but just like I said in uh
[1:31:12] while praying asking the Lord to be able
[1:31:15] to help us
[1:31:17] now you see uh like the prophet of God
[1:31:20] said we we
[1:31:23] are very used to this sticky nature
[1:31:27] that's what we grew with what uh
[1:31:30] whatever your age is it is how much you
[1:31:33] know your sticky nature
[1:31:36] and and that's the reason why we keep
[1:31:39] looking at areas in our life and wanting
[1:31:43] God to change those areas
[1:31:47] and uh and and and because the devil
[1:31:50] knows the human mind runs that way so he
[1:31:53] frustrates us
[1:31:55] praise the Lord amen
[1:31:58] the devil don't he don't he don't he
[1:32:01] don't have an idea
[1:32:03] of uh of the change that is going on
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:08] praise the Lord he don't have an idea of
[1:32:11] the change there because it's God that
[1:32:12] is carrying on the change
[1:32:15] praise the Lord he's the one carrying on
[1:32:18] the change we can change ourselves
[1:32:22] praise the Lord
[1:32:23] I mean we can we can do works and works
[1:32:26] and works it will never change
[1:32:29] it brings us to a big frustration
[1:32:31] you see and that is that is the reason
[1:32:34] why
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:38] fellowshipping around the world
[1:32:40] getting acquainted with what the
[1:32:43] messenger says it's very important
[1:32:47] because you see is the holy spirit that
[1:32:50] quickened the change to you
[1:32:53] he he makes you to recognize those areas
[1:32:56] where God is changing you
[1:33:01] if you are not having the prayer life if
[1:33:03] you are not staying under the atmosphere
[1:33:05] of the word
[1:33:07] you are bound to see your sticky nature
[1:33:12] and it keeps frustrating you
[1:33:16] you say Lord I I give this thing to you
[1:33:18] Lord I'm I'm praying about this Lord I'm
[1:33:21] tired with this and and I'm tired with
[1:33:23] this but you see when when you say in
[1:33:26] the atmosphere of the word
[1:33:28] then the Holy Spirit quick in those
[1:33:30] little areas in your life
[1:33:33] praise the Lord he helps you to see the
[1:33:36] change and and the brother that helps
[1:33:38] you to see the change in in in in your
[1:33:41] in your son or in your daughter praise
[1:33:44] the Lord
[1:33:44] amen you see that lie that Abraham
[1:33:47] taught that was his sticky nature
[1:33:51] that was a sticky nature he couldn't
[1:33:53] help it help it it shows all the time
[1:34:00] praise the Lord
[1:34:03] but we are in the mystery of a change
[1:34:06] is going on it's going on you know
[1:34:08] brother Brandon says it's changing the
[1:34:11] atoms of our body
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:18] it's a mystery
[1:34:21] it's a mystery
[1:34:27] praise the Lord
[1:34:29] and that's what's going on right now
[1:34:32] that's the reason why the Rapture will
[1:34:36] be a mystery
[1:34:40] foreign
[1:34:42] 1963 we have been in
[1:34:46] the cycle
[1:34:48] the Lord himself shall descend
[1:34:52] when he descended down with the shout
[1:34:55] which is the message of the hour the
[1:34:57] opening of the seals
[1:34:59] we have been in the atmosphere of the
[1:35:03] rapture
[1:35:05] that's the reason why the sounding of
[1:35:09] the message of the hour
[1:35:11] is changing us from glory to glory
[1:35:18] amen praise the Lord
[1:35:21] and because the devil don't want us to
[1:35:24] appreciate those change so he keeps
[1:35:27] taking you back to your sticky nature
[1:35:29] keep reminding you all you say you have
[1:35:32] not become anything better yet it's the
[1:35:34] same thing still going on and the same
[1:35:36] things they're going on and the same
[1:35:38] thing still going on
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:44] praise the Lord
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:50] that's the reason why we have to look at
[1:35:52] ourselves through the word
[1:35:55] we have to look at ourselves through the
[1:35:57] word what the messenger says what are
[1:36:01] the promises concerning us
[1:36:03] that's why you have to be looking at not
[1:36:06] looking at yourself not looking at your
[1:36:08] struggle
[1:36:09] now looking at your sickness not looking
[1:36:11] at the symptoms
[1:36:12] but looking at the promise
[1:36:16] foreign
[1:36:20] that's the blessing of staying in the
[1:36:24] atmosphere of the word
[1:36:25] like the prophet of God said there is
[1:36:27] there is nothing you can do to bring a
[1:36:29] chick out of an egg
[1:36:31] you try it you're going to kill the
[1:36:32] chick
[1:36:34] all it needs is just to keep it under
[1:36:37] the right atmosphere
[1:36:40] that little chick in That head has the
[1:36:42] ability to crack that head open
[1:36:45] praise the Lord and the thing to get you
[1:36:48] over your seeking nature is already in
[1:36:50] you just keep in the atmosphere of the
[1:36:53] word
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:55] just stay in the atmosphere of the world
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:37:07] praise the Lord
[1:37:10] The Mystery of the changes going on

[1:37:43] parents
