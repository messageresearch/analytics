so we're going to start with the the annual business meeting and this is the for the one year period ending December 31st 2019 and actually we're gonna go a little bit beyond that because for the one it asked me to cover a couple other things as well so then so we will do that see if I can get my thing here to work I'm trying let's see what am i there we go did I do that or did you do that I did that okay maybe I have to point in that direction should have to okay alright well we're going to cover the general account and the missions account we're going to talk about the building fund account the silver investment now a couple of things that brother one wanted me to talk about because originally this these were the four things that I was going to talk about this morning and brother one also wanted us to talk about giving online and the remodel project for the general account we began the year with a balance of fifteen thousand one hundred two dollars in 10 cents and actually I'm going to try to go pretty fast through this because we got we have a lot to cover and we have a short time to to cover it so we started off the the year with 15,000 102 dollars and 10 cents we had income of sixteen thousand three hundred twenty-six dollars and seventeen cents of that there was sixteen thousand seventy one dollars and sixteen cents that were offerings and then we had contributions to the children's ministry of two hundred fifty five dollars in one cent our expenses for the years it was an expensive year for us in 2019 our expenses were twenty-five thousand one hundred nine dollars and twenty five cents the in the break down on those expenses building maintenance was four thousand seven hundred seventy dollars and 87 cents grounds maintenance one thousand three hundred seventy two dollars and ninety eight cents we had insurance we and we you know insurance in some again we keep insurance on the building and and then it covers more than just the building it covers the ministry and everything that was two thousand nine hundred fifty $8.67 janitorial expenses of two hundred ninety five dollars ten cents ministry expenses of six hundred ninety 6.41 cents and and I know I didn't know quite know what to call it I call it ministry expenses it's it's it's different than the tithe account is different than the the ministry that we consider you know in order to normally think of as ministry but I'll cover in detail you don't know what I'm talking about when I get to it miscellaneous expensive $215 and 84 cents we had sound room expenses of eleven thousand two hundred twenty dollars eighty two cents and utilities of three thousand five hundred seventy dollars and fifty six cents so we had a net loss our income was a loss loss of eight thousand seven hundred eighty three dollars and eight cents so we ended the year with a bank balance of six thousand three hundred nineteen dollars and two cents okay sorry I've got this pointer this I don't know what you call this thing but anyway it's supposed to I supposed to be able to move this yeah I don't know yeah we're trying to figure this out I'm trying to go to the next slide and this thing that's supposed to get me there isn't there we go okay yeah and I don't know why this these came out blue I've had this happen before that the back of the backgrounds blue anyway for building maintenance we had electrical labor and supplies of $500 and 87 cents the changing table parts and supplies was one hundred sixty three dollars the security system installation in parts of $470 a furnace repair of five hundred ninety five dollars we had a frozen pipe repair of one hundred fifty dollars and then we had a zoning system replacement of two thousand nine hundred dollars or a total for building maintenance was four thousand seven hundred seventy dollars and 87 cents the grounds maintenance we had salt and supplies of twenty four dollars and forty seven cents we had snow plowing and actually there are snow plowing for 2019 was a little more expensive now keep in mind that the salt and the snow plowing in two thousand any year in a year I report it happens twice it happens at the beginning of year it happens at the end of the year because we have usually we have snow in November December and we also have snow January February March April so anyway it was snow plowing expenses one thousand three hundred twenty dollars and the and then we had a work party expense of twenty dollars and 51 cents so our total grounds maintenance was one thousand three hundred seventy two dollars and ninety eight cents our janitorial expenses we had disinfectant at seventy seven dollars 98 cents gloves 3390 two hand soap of six ninety eight paper products the favorite products typically are your paper towels your toilet paper Kleenex $217 and then vacuum bags twenty eight dot 95 so we had a total of two hundred ninety five dollars in 10 cents for janitorial supplies ministry expenses now these are the ministry these are the expenses I explained and that's not the same as the ministry and in the church but as a general expense to the general account these would be what we'd consider ministry expenses we bought Bibles at $36 and it's just real quick I've mentioned about the Bible's we we buy the Bibles we don't buy the Bibles for the people that attend services here the Bibles are really meant for people that come to visit now right now nobody's visiting and nobody is here well I shouldn't say nobody's here we've we've got five of us here right now and and hopefully we'll have seven before the days over I don't know we'll see but but anyway the Bibles are intended for visitors and so if you are a regular member of the church it's best if you bring your own Bible as opposed to using the Bibles that we have in the back for people to use that are visiting III remember and it was some years ago but I remember one time we had bought Bibles we had Bibles for for the the services and for visitors and and one time we had three young men show up and they were visiting and there wasn't a Bible anywhere because what happened was the Bibles we had people had were used them that just attend and so they didn't have any and that's what they were for and so if you have if you attend here regularly please bring your own Bible it just it makes sense I mean I carry my Bible Church I mean most people carry their Bibles to church you should carry your Bible to church all right charity we had Venezuela we we were helping with the the effort down there that was a situation where they they had something going on in their country and they they basically it's like they had closed their borders and I mean there was a lot going on and they were having food shortages and lots of all kinds of stuff going on so we were helping there so we $200 down there communion wine we spent $26 and 2 cents on communion wine foot washing basins of 32 dollars and 58 cents music ministry was four dollars and twenty nine cents and that was I believe just the expense of some what was that strings for something and then the table now the table is it's the program that we use that has the messages where it actually plays the audio but then allows us to see the visual and it follows along the visual follows follows along the the audio and that's the table so we had a total expense ministry expense of six hundred ninety six dollars and forty-one cents miscellaneous expenses we had condolence or greeting and actually that was I believe the condolence was k-mer was a plant or what it was it was for brother David right for his funeral and then a greeting card if I'm not mistaken was for brother Wes and sister Carol on their 50th wedding anniversary and then the we had contribution envelopes of $91 we had the offering bags that we purchased for taking up the offerings during the service that was $40.99 and then office supplies of 37 dollars and 97 cents we had a total miscellaneous expense of two hundred fifteen dollars and 84 cents sound room we had the internet service which we see we stumped trying to think of them that started I think it started in October in November and so that was three hundred seventy seven dollars and thirty one cents I think it was must be in October because each month is like a 110 120 dollars it's a I forget the exact amount but and then the then I think there was some fee to start when it was first set up and then the sound system we spent ten thousand eight hundred forty three dollars and fifty one cents on the sound system and so we had a total 11200 20 dollars and 82 cents now we spent a lot of money on the sound system at the time most of that money it was being spent by a brother loyal he was here doing the sound and so he was he was here and I know brother Jordan I'm gonna share how much brother Jordan was involved in the expenses but as a result of what they did is because it's it's because of that that you're able to be home watching the service right now is because of what was what was done with the sound system so that's part of it and there was a little but there's a lot more than that we've I mean if you look around the the sanctuary you can see a lot where that was spent on the sound system so anyway so we spent eleven thousand two hundred twenty dollars and eighty two cents on the sound room utilities now with the utilities I kind of laid this out a little differently where I just I listed the four years because we can you know utilities usually are pretty consistent but you can kind of track it for a period of time and see how how things have changed in 2019 we on the electric we spent one thousand three hundred sixty $9.97 on gas we spent nine hundred fifty nine dollars and sixty eight cents on the sewer and water we spent nine hundred fifty five dollars and thirty-five cents and then the waste disposal which is our trash and that's why kind of a fancy way to say it but that's our waste disposal nine hundred I'm sorry two hundred eighty five dollars and 56 cents now the waste disposal that was one actually when I mentioned last year the last time we had this I mentioned that it was changing and is really because of because Kelly's sister she had gotten involved and she helped us because she works in in trash she works in waste that sounds bad she works in waste disposal she's done that for years and so she she knows people and and so she actually got us a really good deal within new trash company and so as you can see we spent six hundred thirteen dollars 34 cents last year 2018 2019 we spent less than half of that so it's so that was good of course it's not like a lot of money I mean too bad it wasn't six thousand that we were spending in 2018 and now we're only spending you know less than three thousand but no it's not that much it's only six hundred and two hundred and eighty five so but anyway still it's it's it's a it's a good thing it's always good when we can save money but if you if you look across you can see kind of how the trend has been in the different years for the the different utilities that we have our our electric it's it's about the same as it was in 2017 it went down from 2018 the the same with gas actually gas is less than what it was in 2017 a little bit more than what it was in 2016 but it's certainly a lot less than it was in 2018 Seward and water now Seward and water we were spending more than we've ever spent I think some of that has to do with we've had problems with toilets not the flapper not going down right and then just water just runs and runs if somebody leaves the church and there's water running in the toilet that water is going to run for a long time before somebody comes back and corrects it and so we end up using a lot of water and unfortunately the way this though things work I know at my home it works that way and I'm guessing it works the same way here is they determine your sewer expense by your water expense your water you so whatever whatever water you use your you know that that same volume is applied to your sewer expense and actually sewers though is the more expensive of the two between water and sewer sewers the more expensive but anyway so it went up because of different things happening so anything any time we can I know for myself I'm here if I'm the last person to leave the building I always check to make sure there's not water running because sometimes something would get stuck the flapper doesn't go down on the toilet and water is running and then we've also had situations where well like the the situation with the frozen pipe the frozen pipe ended up with water flooding the building and so I mean not like flooding the whole place but it flooded in the bathroom and that's how it was really it was that was a lot of wasted water all right so just a quick review again so we can close the general account we started the year the bank balance was fifteen thousand one hundred two dollars and ten cents we had income of sixteen thousand three hundred twenty-six dollars and seventeen cents we had expenses of twenty-five thousand one hundred nine dollars and twenty five cents so our net loss was eight thousand seven hundred eighty three dollars and eight cents and so the ending bank balance in 2019 December 31st 2019 was six thousand three hundred nineteen dollars and two cents do I wonder how come it's not showing everything okay we have a little bit of a challenge here for some reason it's not all showing up did we do did we ever get it set up where the people that are watching this are able to call it a ask questions no okay all right well I guess I was I guess there are no questions about the general account so Jordan unless you have any or sister faith or Kelly if you have any questions about the general account okay all right all right so okay so if you do if you do have any questions about the general account just send me an email if you if my my email address is real simple a zero zero two three four six at yahoo.com or you could call me if you have my phone number six five one nine nine four zero one zero eight and that's not my cell phone I don't turn my cell phone on real option okay missions account the missions account the beginning balance was six hundred eight dollars and sixty-five cents the income we have twenty four hundred dollars that was three hundred twenty dollars and 33 cents from individual contributors and a tithe contribution of two thousand seventy nine dollars and 67 cents we had expenses of one thousand seven hundred sixty dollars that was for Tanzania we sent sixteen hundred dollars transfer fees was $160 and so we had a net income of six hundred forty dollars and the ending balance was one thousand two hundred forty eight dollars and sixty-five cents all right again if you have any questions about the missions account just send me an email call me the building fund account and sorry I'm trying to go fast cuz I'm trying to get done here hopefully close to being on time I might be a little over the building fund account the beginning balance was one thousand one hundred seventeen dollars the income four hundred fifteen dollars and thirty four cents and that was we had an individual individual contribution of $415 and actually it wasn't I don't think it was just one thing there was two individuals that contributed to it last year and then interest payment of $34.50 we had an ending balance of one thousand five hundred thirty two dollars and thirty four cents okay again if you have any questions email me call me our silver investment 2018 the year-end market value was seven thousand seven hundred thirty-five dollars 2019 on December 31st of 2019 our year-end market value was eight thousand nine hundred and ten dollars so it did go up we had a net gain at $1,175 though I will say that right now it's down and I think it's even down less than what it was in 2018 so it's gone down since since everything's been happening that we've been going through again if you have any questions about the silver investment just email me to call me alright okay we want to talk about giving online there was information that was sent out I'm trusting that most everyone got that now they sent it out through an app that I'm not familiar with what's is it wasps wasps app loss app I always thought people were saying what's up what's up so what's up alright anyway it was wall sap anyway so information was sent out I don't have I don't have that app so I don't have many apps I'm I'm pretty appleís there yeah the online giving it's available on the church's website so if you go out to the church's website you can you can actually give online through the church's website there's instructions on the church's website also for text giving on the church's website so you can you can give you can use text giving actually we've had one person used sorry we have one person use the text giving and it's it's where you call the number and you put some code in there and then it brings up some information and of course my question too and brother Andrew god bless brother Andrew he's the one that's been setting all this up my question in him was well the will this work on my flip phone and he's like not unless I do a lot of work so apparently they can get it to work on a flip phone but I told me it's not I don't know Bob don't waste your time I'm not gonna I'm not gonna use my flip phone to do any texting and sending money to anybody anyway but when you do give online there's a two percent convenience fee so you need to be aware of that now I ideally if we can get everybody to agree on giving through your bank account as opposed to giving off of your check card or credit card we can reduce that convenience fee to 1 percent across the board so we it could be a 1 percent convenience fee instead of a 2 percent convenience fee I know there's been some questions about the convenience fee some people have seen some things and they they thought I was wrong and and I and I've checked it now at least from what I'm seeing from from the people that have given money through the through the churches websites that have given money online that convenience fee that 2 percent convenience fee is a 2 percent convenience fee people thought they were getting uncharged you know some you know more something more expensive than 2% and it's just not the case now originally when we first started we we had I think it was a 3% fee that we are charging and we we we just reduced that to 2% so it's a 2% fee long story and I don't want to get into it right now but ideally though if we get everybody to go to contributing through your bank account as opposed to your your cheque card or your or a credit card we can use a 1 percent convenience fee and it would be a lot you know better for everybody and I would like to mention if you use your credit if you use a credit card to give money to the church please don't do that you know you don't mean it's it's if it's a bank card it comes out of your bank account and that's okay but if you're using a credit card I wouldn't do that because I mean it's it's easy to not pay the whole thing off pretty soon you're gonna have a huge bill and your credit card and that's not the way to give alright and then there we have other options for giving the you can mail your contribution checks to me and the only reason I mention all this the reason I'm mentioning this is because of our current situation all right right now we have seven people here a church there's seven of us I think that's right one two yeah we have seven you know people can't give like like they normally would give because they we we do it here and you can't give your money here and so we are you know trying to figure out a way that allows people to pay their ties and give offerings and and in trying to find a way that works for people so that was the I don't know if that's the only reason but it certainly was a was a big factor in why we set up the online giving but you can mail your in checks to me I brother Wes and sister Carol god bless them they have mailed their checks to me for years and and it's in it's easy it comes in my mailbox and I just put it in the same stack I put everybody else's contribution in and then I just you know total it up with everybody else's so you can also bring your contributions to my home you can pay me a visit everybody anybody anybody and everybody's welcome maybe not all at the same time but but you are welcome you can bring your contributions to my home and actually and we there's someone that has done this for a long time and so we have you know we have at least I I know for sure one person actually well no there was there's been a couple different ones have brought contributions to my home you're certainly welcome to do that again it just goes in the same stack with everybody else's contribution and then you can also use direct deposit from your employer so you can you can have your money go direct to the church account before it even it doesn't you won't even see it now that's good and bad they're there there's only been a couple people that use it and one of the persons they the the reason they did is because they they didn't want to see the money because they didn't want the chance to spend the money so they have it as a direct deposit which and it's I mean it's good it's a you know comes out it comes I mean it obviously the church gets it before they do so I guess that's a good thing no but what you can do that you can use direct deposit alright so if there's any questions about online giving or giving in the other ways that I mentioned just email me call me you know we can but we'll make it happen I mean I you know it's it's hard right now with with everything that's going on and it's especially hard with trying to give and you know the one thing that I just want to caution people because I've seen this happen where for some reason they forget to give they don't give and there's some people I can't say that I know this for a fact but just based on what I've seen in people's records it appears that when sometimes when people forget they don't go back and and and pay their they don't pay their tithe they say oh I forgot that and just move on like it's okay I for me it's not okay I mean I I have forgotten to pay my tithe I remember one time this would have been back in the maybe in the late 80s and we were we were we my my wife's aunt and uncle came to visit us and and their two children came to visit us and for some reason it just totally just did them coming to visit just kind of threw me off and so I I just I forgot to pay my tithe and I didn't realize it until I went to pay my tithe the next time and it's like I realize like I'm booking throats like why didn't pay my tithe and anyway so I know I paid my tithe I mean tithing to me is very important I mean it's God's money I mean you can see I mean if God gives you the okay to just you know don't worry about it forget it and you keep that money well that's that's fine if God gives you that if he gives you the okay I'm not going to tell you otherwise but God has never given me that okay I pay my tithe so alright the remodel project sorry I forgot we still had one more thing all right a remodel project in fact lease it effectively starts Monday April 13 the sanctuary will gain two rows so we have two extra rows in the back the sound room will become a sound booth so we will no longer have a sound room we will have a sound booth the pastor's office will move it will no longer be at the back of the sanctuary the tape library and the nursery sink will be removed so the tape library is going to be history and that sink in the nursery is history and then the nursery Sunday School room will move slightly which is kind of we're gonna move it over and down so listen we're gonna hopefully okay hopefully they will be able to see here what what we're gonna do okay oh now I'm hoping you can see this is this is the the existing setup now I haven't used the oh no okay I got this I got this pointer thing or this how do I do though okay now actually right in here okay can they they can see this right okay right in here this is this we don't have it drawn in here but this is the janitorial closet right here so but other than that that's probably the only room that we don't have really detailed in here but this little library here tape library and this sink they're going away and then of course the pastor's office here is going to go away and this sound room here is going to go away all right so this is what it should look like when we're done so the this will all be sanctuary we're going to have a sound booth right here we're going to gain two rows over here two rows of chairs and here we're going to it's going to be two rolls but it's going to amount to about the one because we got the sound booth right here so we're gonna have a row right here and I think those I think the smaller two row is going to be the front row correct so we'll have like four chairs right here and three chairs right here that's just enough so people can get into the sound booth and then the pastor's office is going to go right here and then this right here will be the Nursery / Sunday School room and it's going to be about the same dimensions as it is right now it's going to be and not quite but what even though there it's going to be a little bit narrower not much but a little bit what they're going to gain there there isn't going to be a door to begin their way here there isn't going to be a sink opening right here so this wall can all have chairs this can have chairs and this can have chairs so they can put chairs all the way around and so in that in that regard it'll it'll work out well and the pastor's office is going to be just as narrow as it is right now just wide enough to get his desk in there like it is right now so his desk will probably be right on it will be will probably it'll be right here on this end of his desk and and this will be his return right here and but he'll have it's a little bit longer so he's got a little bit more space maybe to actually fit it more than one chair in there other than his so so that's the that's the plan with the remodel that's that we have scheduled and so again if you have any questions about the remodel project just email me call me and and we'll discuss it and then if there's any other questions send me an email call me all right well thank you very much god bless you all [Music]
