[17:52] where the disciples were assembled
[17:55] for fear of the jews came jesus
[17:59] and stood in the midst and said unto
[18:02] them
[18:03] peace be unto you and when he had
[18:08] when he had so said he show unto them
[18:11] his hands and his side
[18:16] then were the disciples glide when they

[18:24] peace be unto you as my
[18:28] father have sent me even so
[18:31] saying are you and when he has said

[19:09] lord
[19:10] we need the breath of god father
[19:14] for your word is the air that we breathe
[19:19] especially in such a time of god when
[19:22] we have uh this uh
[19:26] epidemic upon the earth for father and
[19:29] and we
[19:29] all using max to go into different
[19:32] places lord at work
[19:34] and father we want your world to be the
[19:38] air we breathe
[19:40] we want to breathe upon your promises of
[19:43] god
[19:44] father we're just committing ourselves
[19:46] in your hands tonight lord
[19:48] we say father breathe upon us tonight
[19:51] we love you and we appreciate you thank
[19:53] you for undertaking for us today the
[19:56] different things we have to do
[19:58] going to work and taking care of
[20:01] businesses and different things at home
[20:03] we just commit this time into your hands
[20:06] now
[20:07] lord as we sank a few minutes ago we
[20:10] want to be shouting with you
[20:12] speak to us tonight in the way only you
[20:14] can
[20:15] in jesus name we pray amen
[20:19] the lord bless you let me have you see
[20:23] amen so we'll go now to ask chapter 2
[20:27] and pick up with our reading
[20:31] and uh
[20:36] we stopped on verse 4 and they were
[20:40] all filled with the holy ghost and began
[20:42] to speak
[20:43] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[20:46] them alterings verse 5
[20:48] and there were dwelling a jerusalem jews
[20:51] devoted man
[20:52] out of every nation under heaven
[20:56] now when this was noticed abroad
[21:00] the multitude came together and were
[21:02] confounded because
[21:04] that every man heard them speak
[21:07] in his own language that is something
[21:10] that we have to
[21:11] underline that every man
[21:15] uh heard in their own language
[21:19] when those apostles were all speaking in
[21:22] tongues
[21:23] and verse 11
[21:25] [Music]
[21:27] and verse 7 sorry and they were all
[21:30] amazed
[21:31] and mother saying one to another behold
[21:34] i being that
[21:35] all uh and not all these
[21:39] we speak gather lady he says and uh
[21:43] and how year we every man
[21:46] in our own tongue
[21:50] uh wherein we were born praise the lord
[21:54] so uh we know that
[21:58] the holy spirit fell and a gift of the
[22:01] spirit
[22:02] was birthed among them and uh and
[22:05] speaking in tongues now
[22:08] uh just like i said i try to stay away
[22:11] there you know from from
[22:13] all a lot of the the doctrinal part of
[22:15] this
[22:16] in the sense of uh we know that speaking
[22:19] in tongues is not the evidence of the
[22:21] holy ghost
[22:22] and
[22:23] [Music]
[22:25] but as we look over here in the book of
[22:27] acts
[22:28] and the continuation of uh uh
[22:32] the work of christ in the church it is
[22:34] very important
[22:36] that they have to start this way you
[22:39] know because it has to be
[22:41] christ living in us you know
[22:44] and working out doing the things that he
[22:47] promised to do
[22:48] so the holy ghost is very important so i
[22:52] want to just speak
[22:53] a little bit and and just do a bible
[22:56] studies tonight
[22:57] where we will look through the scripture
[22:59] and
[23:00] uh because we know that this was a
[23:03] promise
[23:04] you know the promise of the father the
[23:07] holy ghost
[23:08] was a promise that was given it was
[23:10] spoken about
[23:11] in george chapter 2 and as i also spoke
[23:15] about
[23:16] it a little yet a little there and with
[23:18] stumbling lips i will speak unto my
[23:21] people
[23:21] so we have all of this lying in
[23:25] in in the promise there that god gave to
[23:28] his people
[23:29] now brother branham someone asked bert
[23:31] branham a question
[23:33] on st john chapter 20. so i want to take
[23:36] that
[23:36] and and start the other with our
[23:41] our subject tonight
[23:49] on question and answer 1964
[23:53] he was asked this question
[23:58] dear brother branham what is the
[24:01] difference
[24:02] when jesus breathed on his disciples and
[24:06] said
[24:07] receive ye the holy ghost
[24:10] and when they had to go to
[24:14] the upper room to tarry
[24:19] this year believer dear brother or
[24:23] sister was asking this question what is
[24:25] the difference between
[24:27] jesus breathing on the disciples
[24:31] and telling them receive ye the holy
[24:33] ghost that's the word of god
[24:35] and
[24:38] and the difference of them going
[24:42] to the upper room to tarry
[24:45] i love the way he said it he answered
[24:48] the question he says
[24:49] it was a promise he gave them
[24:52] breathe upon them his promise
[24:56] said receive ye the holy ghost
[25:00] it was a promise they went to
[25:04] the upper room to wait for the promise
[25:08] to be fulfilled
[25:12] he gave them the promise he already
[25:14] spoke to them in
[25:15] john 14 15 16 about the comforter
[25:19] and the holy spirit the spirit of truth
[25:21] that would guide them and lead them
[25:24] that was before his death buried in
[25:26] resurrection
[25:27] and after he resurrected when he
[25:30] appeared unto his disciples
[25:32] he said peace be shalom peace be unto
[25:35] you
[25:36] he said that twice and before he left
[25:38] them the scripture said he
[25:40] breathed upon them and said receive ye
[25:43] the holy ghost
[25:47] but yet they had to tire it they had to
[25:50] wait
[25:51] for the pentecost now because you see
[25:55] even though jesus breathed upon them and
[25:58] said receive you the holy ghost
[26:00] there are a lot of things that are tied
[26:02] in here because there are scriptures
[26:04] that have to be fulfilled
[26:06] and because the holy ghost was also
[26:10] a type of the jubilee he that the son
[26:13] has set free
[26:14] will be freed indeed he has to wait
[26:17] until
[26:18] the 50th day which is pentecost
[26:22] it has to come on the 50th day because
[26:25] the holy ghost is also tied to the
[26:28] promise of the jubilee
[26:31] so brother branham says it was a promise
[26:34] he gave them
[26:35] he breathed upon them his promise said
[26:37] receive ye
[26:38] the holy ghost it was a promise
[26:42] they went to the upper room to wait for
[26:45] the promise to be fulfilled
[26:47] he says the same thing is when we lay
[26:50] our hands on the sick
[26:54] when we lay our hands to be healed we
[26:56] pray for the sake
[26:58] then you go on about your business
[27:02] waiting for the promise to be fulfilled
[27:07] praise the lord the same thing
[27:11] when the angel said unto mary
[27:15] the holy spirit will overshadow you
[27:19] and you will be found with trying she
[27:22] went
[27:22] on saying be it unto me a calling
[27:26] to your word the promise is given
[27:30] and we go believing for the promise
[27:34] to be fulfilled he says that's the same
[27:37] thing
[27:37] when we lay hands upon you to be healed
[27:41] then you go on about your business
[27:44] waiting for the promise to be fulfilled
[27:48] praise the lord so
[27:51] uh there are few things here i want for
[27:54] us to
[27:55] for us to look at in the scripture uh
[27:58] just like we did sunday we were looking
[28:00] at
[28:02] the comforter and looking through
[28:06] the gospel now we will see here that
[28:15] right from matthew chapter 1
[28:21] verse 18 that was when the angel visited
[28:24] mary
[28:25] an angel said to mary you will be found
[28:29] with child
[28:30] of the holy ghost
[28:34] and you will be found with child of the
[28:36] holy ghost
[28:38] the holy ghost the holy spirit
[28:42] that subject just like the kingdom of
[28:44] god
[28:45] it came really open in the new testament
[28:50] but yet it was something that also had
[28:53] a witness in the old testament when
[28:56] a priest was anointed when the king was
[29:00] anointed uh that anointing was
[29:04] was uh an example
[29:07] of uh allowing the the spirit of god to
[29:12] be able to guide the king or guide the
[29:14] priest into the office
[29:16] that they were placed in so in the old
[29:18] testament we have
[29:20] shadow we have types of the holy spirit
[29:22] but
[29:23] the subject and talking about the holy
[29:25] ghost really came
[29:26] out in the new testament but look over
[29:29] here in mark chapter 12
[29:31] verse 36 the scripture says
[29:35] we read some few verses and then we'll
[29:38] look at
[29:39] all of this together mark chapter 12.
[29:47] let's just do a little bible studies
[29:48] together now
[29:52] my chapter 12 verse 36
[30:02] chapter 5 the bible says and jesus
[30:04] answered and said
[30:05] why why he taught in the temple
[30:09] house said the stripe that christ
[30:12] is the son of david for david himself
[30:16] said by the holy ghost now so we
[30:19] realized here
[30:21] the scripture is on a line in here that
[30:23] david
[30:24] under inspiration
[30:29] under inspiration so david
[30:33] by the holy ghost they david said by the
[30:36] holy ghost the lord said
[30:38] unto my lord sit down on
[30:41] my right hand till i make that enemy
[30:44] that falls to so this verse here
[30:47] gave us an idea that the holy ghost
[30:51] was in the old testament
[30:57] because it was by inspiration
[31:00] now the word inspiration
[31:04] brings us to the place to be able to
[31:06] look at this word that we want to deal
[31:08] with tonight
[31:09] called the breath of god
[31:14] that's what that word means when when
[31:17] paul says every
[31:18] every scripture is given by inspiration
[31:23] job in the book of job says the
[31:25] inspiration of the almighty given wisdom
[31:29] that word inspiration that is used
[31:32] throughout the scripture brother branham
[31:34] says i'll read it to you here
[31:36] he says that that that was the best form
[31:39] of words that the
[31:40] the theologians could find to describe
[31:43] the birth of god
[31:46] the inspiration of the almighty and we
[31:49] know that inspiration
[31:51] is is uh uh that breath of god which is
[31:54] the inspiration
[31:55] is also the pouring out of the holy
[31:58] ghost
[31:59] so david by the holy ghost
[32:03] which of course this is over in the
[32:05] psalm
[32:06] so david by the holy ghost honor
[32:09] inspiration
[32:10] he says my lord said unto my lord
[32:15] let's look a few more verses again luke
[32:18] chapter 1 verse 15
[32:24] few more verses here before we get on
[32:27] going
[32:32] just want to bring it out that this
[32:34] subject of the holy ghost is not
[32:36] only peculiar to we
[32:39] new testament believers is all there
[32:42] just even before the date of pentecost
[32:45] let's go ahead yet a little bit luke 1
[32:49] 15
[32:54] praise the lord verse 13
[32:58] and the angel said unto him fear not
[33:01] zechariah for thy prayer is heard
[33:04] and the wife elizabeth shall bear thee a
[33:07] son
[33:08] and thou shalt call his name john
[33:12] and thou shall have joy and gladness and
[33:15] many shall rejoice
[33:17] at his birth for he shall be great
[33:21] in the sight of god and shall
[33:24] drink needle wine non-stone drink and he
[33:28] shall be filled with the holy ghost
[33:31] even from his mother's womb
[33:35] now you have to realize that this is
[33:37] before pentecost
[33:42] this is before the day of pentecost
[33:45] that's why i want to grab your attention
[33:49] that this is before the day of pentecost
[33:52] when david spoke by the holy ghost it
[33:54] was before the day
[33:56] of pentecost
[34:00] luke chapter 1 verse 41.
[34:07] we will read from verse 39 and married
[34:10] arose
[34:11] in those days and went into the hill
[34:14] country
[34:16] with his into the city of judah
[34:20] and and entered into the house of
[34:23] zacharias and saluted elizabeth
[34:28] and it came to pass that
[34:32] when elizabeth heard the salutation of
[34:34] mary
[34:35] the baby leaped in her womb
[34:43] and elizabeth was filled with
[34:46] the holy ghost
[34:50] this is also before pentecost
[34:55] brother branham says this was when the
[34:58] first time
[34:59] that the name of the lord jesus was put
[35:03] on on uh
[35:06] mortal tongue the first time to talk
[35:08] about him the baby
[35:10] lived for joy and elizabeth
[35:14] was filled with the holy ghost
[35:20] i know a lot of questions might come to
[35:22] your mind brother one is this the
[35:23] baptising of the holy ghost or
[35:25] uh what what is this let's not be his
[35:28] let's travel a little bit verse 67 of
[35:32] the same chapter
[35:45] luke chapter 1 verse 66 we read and all
[35:48] they that heard them
[35:52] lay them up in their heart saying what
[35:54] manner of child
[35:56] shall this be and the hand of the lord
[36:00] was with him and his father zacharias
[36:04] was filled with the holy ghost and
[36:07] prophesied
[36:08] saying blessed be the lord
[36:12] god of israel for he
[36:15] have visited and redeemed his
[36:18] people now we have to realize that
[36:22] this is after zechariah's he was
[36:25] he was he was dumb for some some few
[36:28] days
[36:28] you know the angel told him you know
[36:30] you're not going to speak
[36:32] until this child is born and and
[36:35] and after the child uh uh was born
[36:38] the people were trying to name the child
[36:40] zechariah or name the child
[36:42] uh give the child zechariah's father's
[36:45] name or look for
[36:46] some kind of you know a relative name to
[36:49] give to this child
[36:50] all the men were were deciding now he
[36:53] has to be
[36:53] named after his father and elizabeth
[36:56] said no
[36:57] his name is john the bible says
[37:01] right there the holy spirit came upon
[37:04] zechariah
[37:05] and lose his tongue and he begin to
[37:08] speak
[37:09] and says you know god
[37:12] has visited his people so
[37:15] he was filled with the holy ghost i want
[37:18] us to look at this pattern
[37:20] of being filled with the holy ghost
[37:21] because that was
[37:23] what took place on the date of pentecost
[37:25] but it's more than that
[37:34] praise the lord luke chapter 2
[37:39] verse 25 and 26
[37:48] now you will see here that luke
[37:51] he he brought this in his report in his
[37:55] testimony
[37:56] he brought all of this because he's also
[37:59] reporting in the book of acts
[38:01] about this experience of the holy ghost
[38:04] so let's look at that luke chapter 2
[38:06] verse 25 and 26
[38:17] and behold there was a man in jerusalem
[38:20] whose name was simon
[38:24] and the same man was just
[38:27] and devote waiting for the consolation
[38:30] of
[38:30] israel and the holy ghost
[38:34] was upon him
[38:39] and it was revealed unto him by
[38:43] the holy ghost that he
[38:48] that he should not see death
[38:53] before he have seen the lord's
[38:57] christ so we see zechariah there
[39:01] the holy ghost i mean simon there the
[39:03] holy ghost upon him
[39:05] and the holy ghost revealing to him the
[39:07] holy ghost
[39:08] dealing with him praise the lord
[39:17] luke chapter 3 verse 22.
[39:34] we'll read from verse 21 now when all
[39:37] the people were baptized it came to pass
[39:42] that jesus also being baptized
[39:47] and praying and heaven was open
[39:50] and the holy ghost
[39:54] descended in a
[39:57] buttockless shape
[40:01] like a dolph upon him
[40:04] and a voice came from heaven which said
[40:08] thou are my beloved son indeed
[40:12] i'm well pleased the holy ghost
[40:16] coming in a body leg shape
[40:20] like a dog praise the lord
[40:24] so we see the holy ghost again
[40:28] luke chapter 4 verse 1.
[40:38] and jesus being filled of the holy ghost
[40:42] returned from jerusalem and was led
[40:45] by the spirit into the wilderness
[40:50] praise the lord now this look
[40:53] chapter 1 verse 4
[40:56] let's look at acts chapter 10 verse
[41:00] 38. we're doing a little bible studies
[41:03] here
[41:04] trying to look at the holy spirit
[41:09] through the gospel year
[41:12] through the scripture
[41:20] because sometimes
[41:27] as chapter 10.
[41:37] verse 38 we read from verse 37
[41:41] that word i said ye no which
[41:44] was published throughout all judea
[41:47] and and begin from gathering
[41:50] after the baptism which john preach
[41:55] how god anointed jesus
[41:58] of nazareth with the holy ghost
[42:02] and with power who went about doing good
[42:06] and healing all that were oppressed
[42:10] of the devil for god was with him you
[42:14] you see over and over in the message
[42:16] brother branham quoted this scripture
[42:18] talking about jesus being anointed
[42:21] with the holy ghost now because
[42:24] sometimes
[42:25] and many times when we get to
[42:28] our teaching of the godhead and and
[42:31] we're looking at the three offices
[42:34] when it comes to jesus we believe that
[42:37] you know
[42:37] he was the fullness of god bodily
[42:40] and most of the time people struggle in
[42:43] their mind
[42:44] because jesus was the fullness of god we
[42:47] kind of a struggle in our mind i know
[42:49] her brother
[42:50] you know one time faced me with this uh
[42:52] uh scripture says how can you say that
[42:55] jesus received the holy ghost
[43:02] well i'm not saying it now that's what
[43:03] the scripture says
[43:08] luke chapter 3 22 says you know at his
[43:12] baptism
[43:12] he received the holy ghost chapter 4
[43:14] verse 1 saying it
[43:16] and saint john chapter 1 verse
[43:20] 33 says it asks chapter 10 verse 38
[43:24] says that and god anointed
[43:27] jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost
[43:31] now when you look at that verse you see
[43:34] the three
[43:35] offices play out right in that verse
[43:38] god the father anointed jesus the son
[43:42] with the holy ghost
[43:55] john chapter 7.
[44:11] it's in john chapter seven
[44:32] so john chapter seven let's look at uh
[44:35] verse 39 we've read this before as well
[44:42] verse 37 in in
[44:46] in the last day that great date of the
[44:48] feast
[44:49] jesus stood and cried saying
[44:53] if any man tears let him come unto me
[44:56] and drink
[44:58] he that believeth me as the scripture
[45:01] have said out of his belly shall flow
[45:05] rivers of living water
[45:09] but this he speak
[45:14] but this speak he of the spirit
[45:18] which they that believe on him should
[45:21] receive
[45:23] for the holy ghost was not
[45:26] yet given because
[45:29] that jesus was not yet glorified now so
[45:33] you know you read that but then you go
[45:37] back to all of these
[45:39] examples that we took from the beginning
[45:42] from the birth of jesus
[45:45] told to to the experience of zechariah's
[45:48] and the experience of lit
[45:50] of elizabeth and the experience of simon
[45:54] uh uh in the in in the temple and all of
[45:57] this and then we asked the question
[45:59] but yeah jesus said that the holy ghost
[46:01] was not giving well what was that
[46:07] praise the lord now so what we want to
[46:10] come to here
[46:12] as we we we we want to uh just look at
[46:15] the subject
[46:16] we realized that uh as the scripture
[46:19] speaks
[46:19] in this sense the holy ghost was not
[46:22] given here because
[46:23] jesus was not glorified on the dead of
[46:26] pentecost that was
[46:28] when the very the very first time after
[46:31] uh uh uh uh edem experience
[46:35] after adam and eve walked away from the
[46:38] garden of eden
[46:40] and after our lord jesus and his
[46:43] experience
[46:44] on the on on the river jordan on the
[46:47] date of pentecost was the first time
[46:49] where the spirit of god would come into
[46:52] the human heart
[46:55] now brother branham taught us that under
[46:57] the old testament covenant these men
[47:00] received the holy ghost they were filled
[47:02] they were inspired by the holy ghost
[47:04] but it was just an inspiration it was an
[47:06] anointing that came upon them
[47:11] john received an anointing
[47:14] that made him to speak again after
[47:18] he lost his speech he received that
[47:20] anointing and he said
[47:21] the child name is john he's born to
[47:24] deliver his people
[47:26] simon in the temple the holy ghost came
[47:29] upon him
[47:31] and he prophesied
[47:36] when the name of jesus was mentioned
[47:39] the child in elizabeth
[47:44] lived for joy and she fed an
[47:47] anointing that came upon her
[47:51] that was the holy ghost david on an
[47:54] inspiration
[47:55] when he wrote the psalm he fed an
[47:58] anointing that was the holy ghost
[48:13] said in the message blasphemous name
[48:18] talking about in john chapter
[48:22] 20 he says and when he have
[48:25] said this he breathed on them and said
[48:28] receive yeah the holy ghost church
[48:32] bomb by the birth of god
[48:38] born by the birth of god when this
[48:41] stature has mold itself up there
[48:45] in condition god's breath
[48:48] breathe upon them receive year the holy
[48:51] ghost
[48:52] then you are a son of god
[48:58] you can join anything you want but you
[49:01] are born into the church
[49:04] of the living god
[49:08] praise the lord now let's go back to
[49:12] genesis
[49:14] the first time where the scripture would
[49:15] talks about and god
[49:17] breathed upon man and man became
[49:20] a living soul the breath of god
[49:28] he breathed upon adam he became a living
[49:31] soul and we know
[49:32] under that breath of god adam could name
[49:36] all the animals and god was pleased with
[49:38] aid adam
[49:39] could speak the mountain to this place
[49:41] and bring it on this side and
[49:43] he had that authority as an amateur god
[49:47] upon the earth
[49:48] because he was completely under the
[49:50] breath of god
[49:51] that was just before genesis chapter 3
[49:54] came in
[49:58] praise the lord now you have to watch
[50:01] this
[50:02] because the breath of god is not a
[50:05] sensation
[50:08] the breath of god is the very word of
[50:11] god
[50:18] his breath is his word
[50:24] like brother branham saying here he says
[50:27] he says
[50:28] yeah i read that again he said unto them
[50:32] breathe on them
[50:33] yeah receive ye the holy ghost church
[50:35] born
[50:36] by the breath of god
[50:42] and this stature you know he just
[50:46] he just preached in the morning on the
[50:48] statute of a perfect man
[50:49] and he's preaching in the evening here
[50:51] so he's continuing with that thought
[50:54] how the perfect man the statue of
[50:57] epiphany how a perfect man comes
[50:59] to be a perfect man is by the breath of
[51:01] god
[51:03] so he says when this statue has molded
[51:06] itself
[51:07] up there in condition god's
[51:10] breathe breathe upon him upon them
[51:13] receive here the holy ghost
[51:15] then you are a son of god
[51:18] you can join anything you want but you
[51:21] are born into the church of the living
[51:25] god
[51:25] born by the breath of god god
[51:28] breathed upon them and said receive here
[51:32] the holy ghost so it was not just a
[51:36] statement
[51:39] it was not just a statement when he
[51:41] breathed
[51:42] upon them receiving the holy ghost you
[51:45] remember
[51:45] when we was talking and brother branham
[51:47] says he says
[51:48] that baptism of the holy ghost is just
[51:51] like a little button
[51:54] it's a seed that god placed
[51:58] in the heart of the sons and the
[52:00] daughters of god
[52:05] we have to remember that by one spirit
[52:09] we are baptized into the body
[52:17] that initial baptising of the holy ghost
[52:21] by one spirit we are baptized into the
[52:23] body
[52:28] you know uh pentecostal and the church
[52:31] system
[52:32] they made these holy ghosts everything
[52:34] else they make it sensation
[52:36] they make it a doctrine and they left
[52:39] out the very
[52:40] sea word of god the scripture said
[52:44] in john chapter 1 that we are born by
[52:47] the incorruptible seed
[52:49] which is the word of god that's the
[52:53] breath of god that's where our birth
[52:58] begins
[53:07] receive ye the holy ghost brother
[53:09] branham also said over in mark of the
[53:11] base
[53:12] and the seed of god he said the seal of
[53:15] god
[53:17] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[53:21] the mark of the beast is to reject it
[53:25] receive ye the holy ghost
[53:28] how many won the baptism of the holy
[53:31] ghost
[53:32] stand on your feet how many want to be
[53:35] sealed in the kingdom of god
[53:38] by the holy ghost now so you
[53:42] see that is the baptism of the holy
[53:44] ghost it seals uh
[53:46] into the kingdom of god that is
[53:49] our birth that is word that seed of god
[53:53] the breath of god
[53:54] that brings the the the nature of god in
[53:57] the believer
[53:59] in a seed form
[54:04] it might looks like i'm going in a cycle
[54:06] but i'm coming to a place here
[54:08] brother branham should also reaction to
[54:10] an action he says
[54:11] and as christ said in that
[54:15] in that days gone by as
[54:18] he seven we say now
[54:21] receive ye the holy ghost breathe
[54:24] upon them lord the spirit of life
[54:27] may they go down and receive the holy
[54:30] ghost
[54:31] breathe upon them now the spirit of life
[54:34] and may they go and receive the holy
[54:37] ghost it's
[54:37] almost like what paul said in in
[54:40] galatians chapter four
[54:42] because ye are sons
[54:46] because you are a son
[54:50] that's why the holy ghost comes upon you
[54:54] and what makes you a son is that seed of
[54:57] god
[54:58] is that breath of god that is in you
[55:04] the holy ghost comes upon that word
[55:08] problem says he breathed upon them the
[55:11] promise and what is the promise that's
[55:13] the word
[55:14] the word what is the promise it's the
[55:16] seed it's the breath of god
[55:18] and it had to go and wait for
[55:21] an hour for filming
[55:26] no one can call jesus the christ says
[55:29] the scripture
[55:30] except by the holy ghost
[55:36] praise the lord so there is an
[55:39] initial birth of the spirit
[55:42] there is an initial birth that brings
[55:45] the seed of god into the believer
[55:48] and it is that verb that takes you
[55:50] through all the stages
[55:52] it's that birth that makes you to
[55:55] believe the lord jesus christ as your
[55:57] lord and savior
[55:58] you don't believe it by your human uh uh
[56:01] knowledge is that initial birth
[56:03] of the seed of god the birth of the
[56:06] incorruptible seed
[56:12] it takes us through all the stages it
[56:14] takes us through all the
[56:17] the steps of the stature that brother
[56:18] branham talks about but it first starts
[56:21] from a birth
[56:26] just like the natural birth it starts
[56:28] from a seed
[56:29] the spiritual verb starts from a seed
[56:32] and that
[56:32] is the word of god
[56:35] that's the reason why you cannot put no
[56:38] experience above the word of god
[56:41] brother branham says the seed of god he
[56:43] says is the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:46] he says the mark of the beast is to
[56:48] reject it so you cannot
[56:50] believe that you have the holy ghost and
[56:53] you are rejecting the word
[56:54] it all starts from the word
[57:01] when people make the subject you know
[57:03] whether they're speaking in tongues what
[57:05] a
[57:05] it's a bright light that comes through
[57:07] the room whether it's a warm feeling
[57:09] that goes over the body
[57:10] all of that is wonderful
[57:15] but life begins from that seed
[57:21] life begins from that initial seed
[57:25] spoken word seed that is planted down in
[57:28] the heart
[57:34] the breath of god
[57:37] and that breath of god is the
[57:40] inspiration
[57:41] of the almighty
[57:44] look in acts chapter 10 the bible says
[57:46] why peter
[57:48] preached this word the holy ghost fell
[57:50] upon them
[57:52] the holy ghost follow the word
[58:00] why am i saying out of this tonight i'm
[58:03] talking about
[58:05] ignoring the spirit of truth nor in the
[58:07] holy ghost nor in the way that god is
[58:09] dealing with us
[58:16] because even our young people struggle
[58:20] honor
[58:22] this thoughts
[58:25] it all starts every birth
[58:29] starts from a seed and that's the reason
[58:33] why
[58:34] genesis 1 11 every seed will bring forth
[58:38] of its kind
[58:41] that was why brother branham brought out
[58:43] that message spoken word
[58:46] is the original seed the experience is
[58:49] not the seed
[58:51] the the experience just show that the
[58:53] seed was there
[58:57] but the spoken word of god is the
[58:59] original seed
[59:04] jesus said the the the the spirit of
[59:08] truth he will speak of mean
[59:09] he will remind you he will bring you
[59:11] back to the word the holy ghost will
[59:13] always bring you back to the word
[59:20] that's the spirit of truth
[59:23] now we know on the date of pentecost
[59:26] when the holy ghost came there i mean
[59:28] a gift was birthed they spoke in tongues
[59:35] it was not because that they spoke in
[59:38] tongues
[59:39] means that that was just an evidence
[59:43] it was an outward manifestation of a
[59:46] spirit that was birthed
[59:47] in them
[59:51] so that does not mean that everybody
[59:54] that received the holy ghost
[59:55] have to express the same
[59:58] outward manifestation
[1:00:05] he breathed upon them receive ye
[1:00:08] the holy ghost that's the breath of god
[1:00:11] praise the lord i was looking
[1:00:15] at this thought jesus in st john chapter
[1:00:18] 3
[1:00:20] he's he speaks of
[1:00:23] the holy spirit to naked demons
[1:00:28] and said it's just like a wing
[1:00:38] and i was actually looking at
[1:00:48] okay let me see if if this is what i was
[1:00:50] looking at this afternoon
[1:00:55] i'll just i'll just so the thought that
[1:00:57] was going through my mind when jesus
[1:00:59] talks about
[1:01:00] in in uh genesis i mean
[1:01:03] john chapter 3 he told nicodemus the
[1:01:06] spirit
[1:01:07] you know we just feed it it's like a
[1:01:10] wing it blows
[1:01:11] you know it comes from this weight and
[1:01:12] we just we just get the effect upon us
[1:01:15] we don't know where it's coming from and
[1:01:16] where it's going and all of that
[1:01:19] on the date of pentecost when the holy
[1:01:22] ghost came down
[1:01:24] in the upper room it also came in the
[1:01:26] form of a russian mighty wing
[1:01:32] it also came in the form of a russian
[1:01:35] mighty wing i mean
[1:01:36] they fed a move
[1:01:39] you know the federal move just like uh
[1:01:42] uh isaiah in the temple he said the
[1:01:45] doorposts move
[1:01:47] when those angels came down you know if
[1:01:49] we're trying to cover their eyes and
[1:01:51] their feet
[1:01:52] and their wings he said the doorpost
[1:01:54] moved there was there was a movement
[1:01:56] that took place
[1:01:57] in the building in in the temple with
[1:02:04] isaiah
[1:02:19] i was this afternoon just this evening i
[1:02:21] was reading some things on
[1:02:23] on on the effect of wayne
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:32] and
[1:02:34] it's beautiful to think about how god
[1:02:39] who will type or compare the moving of
[1:02:42] his spirit
[1:02:43] you know in that way praise the lord
[1:02:48] and
[1:03:01] but yet the new testament church was
[1:03:03] birthed
[1:03:04] jesus was going to continue what
[1:03:08] he did and the disciples saw temporarily
[1:03:12] like brother branham said what we saw
[1:03:14] temporarily in his ministry
[1:03:16] you know he says that in the tear pool
[1:03:20] we're going to see those things happen
[1:03:22] what they saw in the three and a half
[1:03:24] year ministry
[1:03:25] he was going to continue that work
[1:03:29] but he needed to have a birth of the
[1:03:31] spirit
[1:03:34] to take away their fears
[1:03:39] he promised them i will be with you even
[1:03:41] in you to the end of the word
[1:03:44] you have all of these promises that was
[1:03:46] given to them the holy ghost comes
[1:03:49] as an assurance to the believer
[1:03:55] he breathed on them receive ye
[1:03:58] the holy ghost
[1:04:02] that's the breath of god the word of god
[1:04:05] is the breath of god
[1:04:11] every time god comes to one age and
[1:04:13] brings a messenger
[1:04:16] just like he did to to ezekiel he took
[1:04:19] ezekiel talking about uh uh the spirit
[1:04:23] of god
[1:04:24] and and what the law was going to do you
[1:04:26] know
[1:04:27] to the house of israel he took ezekiel
[1:04:29] down
[1:04:30] to uh to the to the valley of dry bones
[1:04:36] he took ezekiel there and he asks
[1:04:39] ezekiel what is this he says oh
[1:04:41] this these are all there people dry
[1:04:43] bones
[1:04:45] he said ezekiel can these bones live
[1:04:47] again
[1:04:51] praise the lord can these bones live
[1:04:54] again he says oh lord
[1:04:56] thou know it and what he said to ezekiel
[1:05:00] prophesied in another sense breathe
[1:05:04] upon them and when ezekiel
[1:05:08] prophesied upon the bones you know what
[1:05:10] happened a wing came in the valley
[1:05:13] and started moving the bones to their
[1:05:16] different joints
[1:05:20] after the prophet ezekiel prophesied
[1:05:22] upon the bones
[1:05:23] according to the commandment of the lord
[1:05:26] there was there's a wing
[1:05:27] a whale wing that came in the violin and
[1:05:30] all of those bones starts
[1:05:31] to take shape it starts to move in a
[1:05:34] direction
[1:05:34] for a body to be formed and that is the
[1:05:37] very same thing
[1:05:38] that god does to the church every time
[1:05:42] we sit
[1:05:43] under the word of god he breathed upon
[1:05:45] us
[1:05:46] for us to get strained to stand upon the
[1:05:48] promises for us to get strained
[1:05:51] to rebuke the enemy resist the devil and
[1:05:54] he will flee
[1:05:55] you cannot do it in your own mind you
[1:05:57] have to do it because
[1:05:59] of the word of god you have to do it
[1:06:01] basis on the word of god
[1:06:06] it's not how many times you shake your
[1:06:08] head
[1:06:13] oh man my head will have fall off my
[1:06:16] shoulder
[1:06:18] because when i came to the message as a
[1:06:21] young man i mean
[1:06:22] right in that in in those 10 years
[1:06:25] oh man you're just oh
[1:06:27] [Laughter]
[1:06:30] just shaking your head down the street
[1:06:32] trying to get
[1:06:33] get the devil from on your mind
[1:06:36] but we have to use the word
[1:06:42] we have to use the word
[1:06:47] when he prophesied upon the bones
[1:06:51] life came back to them god was just
[1:06:53] showing the prophet ezekiel
[1:06:55] how he will restore the house of israel
[1:06:58] it's not by power not by might
[1:07:01] but by my spirit said the lord
[1:07:07] now by power nabha might
[1:07:13] receive ye the holy ghost he breathed
[1:07:15] upon him
[1:07:18] it was important if it was not important
[1:07:21] jesus
[1:07:22] wouldn't have done it he spoke to them
[1:07:25] about
[1:07:26] the the the the comforter
[1:07:31] the spirit of truth he taught them that
[1:07:33] was a teaching time
[1:07:35] when he was here in in in the body that
[1:07:37] was a teaching time he taught them
[1:07:39] when the spirit of truth come this is
[1:07:41] what it would do
[1:07:42] it would it would remind you it would
[1:07:44] teach you it will lead you it will guide
[1:07:46] you
[1:07:47] he gave them all of those teaching but
[1:07:50] after he resurrected
[1:07:55] it was time for him to impart the
[1:07:57] believers
[1:07:59] and that's why we are looking forward i
[1:08:02] mean having young people
[1:08:04] that are taking taking the word of god
[1:08:08] no matter what i mean is going on in
[1:08:11] your life what the
[1:08:12] what the enemy is bringing upon you have
[1:08:14] to get on the promises of god's word
[1:08:16] you have to fight the devil because the
[1:08:18] word of god is the sword of god that
[1:08:21] fights the enemy
[1:08:23] you got to identify yourself with the
[1:08:25] promises of god
[1:08:26] god said it i believe it
[1:08:32] all because i believe we are going
[1:08:35] into more troubled waters i mean with
[1:08:38] everything that is happening
[1:08:39] around us praise the lord
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:47] if if if they take the police then we
[1:08:51] will need angers
[1:08:54] we need the angels of the lord to come
[1:08:56] now and guide our home and
[1:08:58] that's i mean that's when we really need
[1:09:00] them to be visible
[1:09:02] praise the lord but what it is
[1:09:07] young people the reason why we are
[1:09:10] saying this
[1:09:12] you know that the holy ghost is it's not
[1:09:14] a myth it's not
[1:09:15] i mean you you got to take the word you
[1:09:17] got to feed upon the world you got to
[1:09:19] meditate upon the world
[1:09:22] even our young people look the bible
[1:09:24] talks about
[1:09:25] about john even though it was
[1:09:28] he was the forerunner you know to come
[1:09:30] and
[1:09:31] present the messiah by the father of the
[1:09:34] matter that is that the scripture says
[1:09:36] even in his mother womb he received the
[1:09:39] holy ghost
[1:09:41] that just made no excuses for our babies
[1:09:45] and sometimes uh parents we i mean we
[1:09:49] just
[1:09:49] we just uh we we overlook these things
[1:09:51] and just think that
[1:09:52] all the they are kids when when they
[1:09:54] grow up
[1:09:56] it is our duty our duty
[1:09:59] right from birth to start teaching them
[1:10:02] preparing their hearts
[1:10:03] for them to receive the holy spirit
[1:10:07] i believe in my mind when when a little
[1:10:09] child comes to the place
[1:10:11] where they get conscious of their
[1:10:13] nakedness
[1:10:14] because that's what the scripture says
[1:10:16] baptism show a good conscience towards
[1:10:18] god
[1:10:19] when a child is getting to that place
[1:10:21] where they are conscious
[1:10:23] parents must start teaching them
[1:10:24] preparing them
[1:10:29] since all you know every child that that
[1:10:32] you know that leaves and
[1:10:34] and and i mean if they have to die young
[1:10:36] to go right in the hands of god that's
[1:10:38] why brother branham said he said jesus
[1:10:40] died for the sin of the world it covers
[1:10:42] that
[1:10:44] but we have to know that the bible says
[1:10:53] repent and be baptized
[1:10:58] they that are baptized will be safe
[1:11:01] that's where it starts from
[1:11:05] a child being born in the message does
[1:11:08] not means that they are said they have
[1:11:09] to be baptized
[1:11:12] and brother branham says we must expose
[1:11:14] them that the lord
[1:11:15] will get them young
[1:11:19] and let god start dealing with their
[1:11:24] hearts
[1:11:26] sometimes the church has just put our
[1:11:28] minds in a place
[1:11:29] where we are looking for a kind of a
[1:11:33] outward uh uh uh manifestation our
[1:11:37] demonstration and
[1:11:38] and as a parent you know as a parent
[1:11:40] sometimes we become so technical on our
[1:11:42] children
[1:11:43] that we just see all their flaws and we
[1:11:46] not even see the little thing that the
[1:11:47] grace of god is doing in their lives
[1:12:02] the bible says zechariah he was a just
[1:12:05] man
[1:12:06] the scripture speaks about simon in the
[1:12:08] temple he was a just man
[1:12:10] even though at that time the holy ghost
[1:12:13] was not given
[1:12:14] as a dwelling being in the body it was
[1:12:18] not dwelling
[1:12:19] but it was still under the inspiration
[1:12:21] of the holy ghost
[1:12:22] in the fact that god was dealing with
[1:12:24] them an angel came to zechariah's
[1:12:27] and spoke to him in the temple and told
[1:12:29] him he would have a child
[1:12:30] god was dealing with them they would
[1:12:32] stay on the blood
[1:12:34] of the old testament still under the
[1:12:36] blood of bulls and gods
[1:12:37] but these men have their hearts right
[1:12:39] and when a man
[1:12:40] or the woman abort again your heart is
[1:12:44] right
[1:12:44] the spirit of god will deal with your
[1:12:48] heart
[1:12:52] if your heart is right
[1:12:55] the spirit of god will deal with your
[1:12:59] heart
[1:13:02] and these few days we've been kind of
[1:13:05] for reading
[1:13:06] through the book of proverbs
[1:13:09] praise the lord and i was taking some
[1:13:13] time to study the book of proverbs as
[1:13:15] well
[1:13:17] you know and just because one of the
[1:13:20] things that will
[1:13:21] that was uh uh dwelling on my mind
[1:13:26] thinking about that is that uh
[1:13:30] that was one of the things that solomon
[1:13:32] asked the lord
[1:13:33] give me wisdom so i can know how to go
[1:13:36] in
[1:13:37] and come out among your people because
[1:13:41] your people are such a great people
[1:13:44] i won't waste them and god
[1:13:47] bless him with wisdom and honor
[1:13:50] inspiration
[1:13:51] a lot of the things that he wrote
[1:13:54] uh a true uh
[1:14:00] through the proverbs uh all about uh
[1:14:04] some of those wisdom that god gave him
[1:14:06] and this is this is something that i
[1:14:08] pick up in
[1:14:09] in chapter four solomon said this and
[1:14:12] it's so beautiful
[1:14:16] proverbs 4 verse 20 he said my son
[1:14:19] attend unto my words
[1:14:23] incline thy ears unto my saying
[1:14:28] now you take it now ask the word of god
[1:14:31] and let them now depart from their eyes
[1:14:35] keep them in the midst of their heart
[1:14:40] for they are alive unto those that find
[1:14:44] them and
[1:14:45] health to their flesh
[1:14:49] and he says keep the heart with all
[1:14:53] diligence the heart is the most
[1:14:56] treasure thing that a man
[1:15:00] needs to keep if there is
[1:15:04] anything that god has made us
[1:15:07] tear us over is to be able to guide our
[1:15:10] hearts
[1:15:14] keep the heart with all diligence
[1:15:17] for out of eight are the issues of life
[1:15:24] if a man keep his heart right
[1:15:30] because we have to know
[1:15:33] when god deals with us
[1:15:36] he done this with our mind he deals with
[1:15:40] our heart
[1:15:41] when that small stab word speaks to you
[1:15:44] it speaks to your heart
[1:15:47] you have to guide your heart
[1:15:51] when we meditate we we we retreat to our
[1:15:55] heart
[1:15:58] as a man think it in his heart
[1:16:01] so is he
[1:16:04] that is the most treasured and even when
[1:16:07] brother branham talks about the holy
[1:16:08] ghost
[1:16:09] he talks about the book of arts and and
[1:16:12] and
[1:16:12] he talks about the holy ghost and the
[1:16:14] heart of man
[1:16:15] being the throne of god
[1:16:20] he says it's that little place in the
[1:16:23] heart where blood do not go
[1:16:25] he says that's the place that god kept
[1:16:27] to put his spirit in
[1:16:31] and yes solomon here
[1:16:34] say my son keep your heart
[1:16:39] with all diligence with everything that
[1:16:41] you can protect
[1:16:44] your heart is the most important thing
[1:16:52] because when the devil put bitterness
[1:16:54] down that place
[1:16:55] you're going to struggle amen
[1:17:00] all the devil can blast your mind with
[1:17:02] different things
[1:17:03] but if he dropped lost in your heart
[1:17:06] it's a spirit
[1:17:09] it's going to torment you
[1:17:14] if he dropped lie in your heart
[1:17:20] even when you are not supposed to lie
[1:17:21] you will still find a way to lie
[1:17:23] it's a spirit
[1:17:32] he's warring to take his throne
[1:17:36] in our hearts
[1:17:40] he wants to take his residence in our
[1:17:42] heart
[1:17:47] because he knows that's the powerhouse
[1:17:51] he knows that's where the control tower
[1:17:53] is
[1:17:57] keep your heart with all diligence
[1:18:02] with all diligence
[1:18:06] the enemy can blast your mind he can
[1:18:08] reflect your body
[1:18:10] he can do whatever he wants to do with
[1:18:13] if your heart is
[1:18:14] guarded and your heart is kept before
[1:18:17] the lord
[1:18:22] you think about job with souls all upon
[1:18:25] his body
[1:18:28] but because he gathered his heart in the
[1:18:30] lord of god's word
[1:18:32] right in the midst of all of those pains
[1:18:35] and boys
[1:18:36] he could say said i know my redeemer
[1:18:38] live it
[1:18:40] strength who comes from the inner of his
[1:18:43] heart
[1:18:45] to make him to rejoice in the vision
[1:18:48] that he was seeing
[1:18:49] even though his healing has not come
[1:18:53] but just a vision broke to his eyes
[1:18:57] he was able to stand up with all the
[1:18:59] sword and the pains
[1:19:00] on his body and he says i know my
[1:19:03] redeemer leave it
[1:19:05] that's what happened to a believer we
[1:19:07] can go through different things
[1:19:08] but the joy of the lord in your heart
[1:19:11] becomes your strength
[1:19:15] because out of the heart comes the issue
[1:19:18] of life
[1:19:21] they had these with every part of our
[1:19:24] life
[1:19:28] every part of our life comes from there
[1:19:33] and that's where god want to put his
[1:19:34] spirit that's where that seed
[1:19:36] of god is planted
[1:19:41] you know it's it's almost like when
[1:19:43] brother branham talks about
[1:19:44] the difference between the presence of
[1:19:46] god and the blessings of god
[1:19:51] he says sometimes the things that we
[1:19:53] feel in the service he said is just the
[1:19:55] blessings of god
[1:19:57] it's just his blessing
[1:20:05] he says but there is something different
[1:20:07] about his presence
[1:20:09] and you look through this through the
[1:20:10] scripture every time a man comes in the
[1:20:13] presence of god
[1:20:14] i mean it is sliding just like
[1:20:18] isaiah he fell straight to his face what
[1:20:22] is mean
[1:20:24] moses there took out his sons and god
[1:20:27] came down
[1:20:28] i mean he felt dead fell at his feet as
[1:20:30] a dead man
[1:20:33] that's the same thing ezekiel said when
[1:20:36] he enter into the presence of the son of
[1:20:38] son of man he says i felt a lot at his
[1:20:41] feet
[1:20:42] as one that is dead
[1:20:54] praise the lord young people guide your
[1:20:58] heart
[1:21:04] fill your heart your desires
[1:21:08] don't think about uh i mean
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:12] the lord has always he promised us never
[1:21:14] to leave us
[1:21:15] never to forsake us amen
[1:21:19] even before we got here he promised us
[1:21:22] that he will not leave
[1:21:24] us he will not forsake us but feel your
[1:21:27] desire
[1:21:29] you know just like paul said he said
[1:21:32] earnestly desired gift
[1:21:35] fill your desires with spiritual things
[1:21:38] lord i want the holy ghost
[1:21:42] lord i want spiritual dreams filled fill
[1:21:44] your heart with those desires
[1:21:49] the lord promised to take care of you
[1:21:52] and and and then i promise you he will
[1:21:56] keep his word he promised to take care
[1:21:58] of you
[1:22:00] he told us in the scripture you see the
[1:22:02] birds he take care of the birds
[1:22:05] he said you see the flowers solomon in
[1:22:07] all
[1:22:08] of his appearing he cannot be compared
[1:22:11] when you bring
[1:22:12] all the flowers together with all the
[1:22:15] abilities
[1:22:20] god take cares of his children
[1:22:24] go to school study your lesson believe
[1:22:27] that the lord will bring you out
[1:22:28] he will give you a good career he will
[1:22:30] give you a good job he will give you
[1:22:32] a good wife a good husband don't
[1:22:35] feel you don't let the enemy fill your
[1:22:37] minds with those things
[1:22:40] fill your heart i want to be a son of
[1:22:42] god
[1:22:45] i want to be able to feed from the
[1:22:47] message i want to i want to be able to
[1:22:49] feed from the breath of god
[1:23:02] guide your heart because out of here
[1:23:04] comes
[1:23:05] the issue of life
[1:23:09] praise the lord as we go talking about
[1:23:14] the book of arts and and and the
[1:23:16] beginning of the church
[1:23:19] we just tried to establish how important
[1:23:22] the holy ghost
[1:23:27] how important it was to the early church
[1:23:32] jesus continuing in his work he just
[1:23:34] couldn't leave those disciples to go
[1:23:38] and brother branham says when he sent us
[1:23:41] he don't allow us to go
[1:23:43] he go with us
[1:23:47] when he sent us he go with us
[1:23:54] that's what we need
[1:24:01] you know young people
[1:24:04] we say then we talk about our different
[1:24:06] experience and we encourage one another
[1:24:09] and then sometimes
[1:24:12] we get to worry and we get to thinking
[1:24:16] and this other sister had this
[1:24:18] experience and this other
[1:24:20] brother had this experience and we get
[1:24:22] into that place
[1:24:23] of comparing with one another
[1:24:27] god deeds with his people in different
[1:24:30] ways
[1:24:32] all you have to do is just guide your
[1:24:36] heart
[1:24:37] keep the desire of god in your heart god
[1:24:40] i want more of you
[1:24:45] young people uh all the the the
[1:24:48] uh the daniel and uh
[1:24:51] uh little prayer and and
[1:24:54] hannah and all of these young young
[1:24:56] children we have
[1:24:59] you people are not just babies
[1:25:03] you know how to use the cell phone you
[1:25:06] must be able to
[1:25:07] do your memory verse
[1:25:10] as a young child that's the thing that
[1:25:12] will as you keep
[1:25:13] memorizing those verses and saying it it
[1:25:16] brings the holy spirit because brother
[1:25:17] brown said every time we talk about him
[1:25:19] he come closer
[1:25:23] sometimes we want to leave the
[1:25:25] responsibility to the sunday school
[1:25:26] teacher
[1:25:27] that is our work as parents
[1:25:32] that is the way we we bring our children
[1:25:34] we expose him to christ
[1:25:36] it's almost like jacob taking her little
[1:25:40] moses and putting him on the river
[1:25:44] that that's a mother's heart looking at
[1:25:46] her baby
[1:25:48] but i'm telling you she did it by the
[1:25:50] instruction of god's word
[1:25:53] believing that if after she has done
[1:25:55] everything she knows how to do
[1:25:57] she believed that god will do the rest
[1:26:00] and that's the reason why we must do
[1:26:02] everything that we know
[1:26:04] that we're supposed to do
[1:26:09] hold the children hands and pray with
[1:26:11] them
[1:26:13] read the scripture to them preparing
[1:26:16] their hearts
[1:26:19] that the seed of god the word of god the
[1:26:21] breath of god
[1:26:22] can find a place in their heart
[1:26:28] we come up with this theological number
[1:26:32] the age of accountability is 12. so
[1:26:35] until they get
[1:26:36] to 12 they are just babies
[1:26:40] when pharaoh the pharaoh sent those
[1:26:42] egyptian soldiers down there
[1:26:44] he never sent them for 13 or 14 years
[1:26:46] old
[1:26:49] when harold sent those roman soldiers at
[1:26:51] the birth of jesus
[1:26:52] he never sent them for teenagers
[1:26:59] and that's the reason why the devil has
[1:27:01] all of these things on the media
[1:27:03] because he knows if he can spoil the
[1:27:05] children's mind from a young age
[1:27:08] if he can spoil your mind from a young
[1:27:11] age the world will have no effect on
[1:27:13] them
[1:27:14] they will just come with you to church
[1:27:16] come with you to church until when they
[1:27:18] get to a certain age they say i'm not
[1:27:19] going today
[1:27:23] because the world never gets your heart
[1:27:36] if john the baptist received the holy
[1:27:39] ghost in his mother womb
[1:27:41] i believe our young people can receive
[1:27:43] the holy ghost there is no
[1:27:45] excuse our young people can receive the
[1:27:48] holy ghost
[1:27:49] if parents will get that desire whether
[1:27:52] we pray
[1:27:53] fast for their children to get the holy
[1:27:55] ghost
[1:27:58] are you looking for one super preacher
[1:27:59] we don't have him
[1:28:01] we don't have the one that all is
[1:28:03] running from their hands
[1:28:06] we must be able to work that's our
[1:28:09] inheritance
[1:28:11] because i'm telling you no matter how
[1:28:14] you are enjoying
[1:28:15] the joy of the lord when the enemy
[1:28:17] starts tempering with your children and
[1:28:20] you will not even enjoy this holy ghost
[1:28:23] that you have anymore because
[1:28:24] you will lay there and just worry and
[1:28:26] just think that's the heart of a mother
[1:28:32] let's do us all that we know how to do
[1:28:36] and leave the rest in the hands of god
[1:28:52] all of these women that was present in
[1:28:56] the upper room they had babies
[1:29:02] there were men there with their wives
[1:29:06] i don't even want a doubt in my mind
[1:29:09] if they were not someday that was
[1:29:10] pregnant
[1:29:12] but they were all waiting on the promise
[1:29:14] of the father
[1:29:17] because this faith would never be sweet
[1:29:21] can you imagine the scripture says they
[1:29:23] were hiding
[1:29:27] they were hiding
[1:29:31] and that's what happened when people are
[1:29:32] hiding
[1:29:34] they live one life before the believers
[1:29:37] and live another life when in india a
[1:29:39] different form of life they are looking
[1:29:40] over their shoulder so nobody can see
[1:29:42] them
[1:29:43] people are always hiding because the
[1:29:45] assurance
[1:29:48] the assurance christ the hope of glory
[1:29:52] needs to be birthed in our heart
[1:29:56] that's what we need as a church
[1:30:01] we need a church word all i mean all the
[1:30:05] brothers the mothers and fathers
[1:30:07] everybody
[1:30:09] just wanting more of the holy ghost
[1:30:12] because remember brother branham says
[1:30:14] that uh uh he says the dynamics of this
[1:30:16] church
[1:30:17] will be the refilling of the holy ghost
[1:30:22] it will be the refilling of the holy
[1:30:24] ghost
[1:30:25] so every time god filled his people
[1:30:29] that out of our balance will flow rivers
[1:30:32] of water
[1:30:38] we can never stop praying for more of
[1:30:40] the holy ghost
[1:30:42] because i will tell you every time that
[1:30:44] god takes
[1:30:45] us into a new experience is a birth
[1:30:48] a child of god is born many times
[1:30:52] some people just take the altar
[1:30:54] confession i was born again
[1:30:56] but every time that god takes you into a
[1:30:59] new experience it's a birth
[1:31:02] sometimes it's messy
[1:31:05] but you grown and when you become
[1:31:09] metro he takes you into another even the
[1:31:12] understanding of his word
[1:31:13] is at birth
[1:31:18] it's a birth when the holy spirit starts
[1:31:20] showing you things
[1:31:21] in the new testament that goes back to
[1:31:24] the old testament when he start
[1:31:26] connecting those things to your heart
[1:31:27] it's a verb it brings the joy of the
[1:31:30] lord it brings a consolation it brings
[1:31:32] strength
[1:31:40] that's the kind of a church we want
[1:31:43] where the people
[1:31:44] their heart is in the world
[1:31:48] where their heart is in the word it's
[1:31:50] not only in the emotion of the preacher
[1:31:53] how he runs down the eye and how he
[1:31:55] shout but you are listening to the word
[1:31:57] you are connected to the word the holy
[1:32:00] ghost
[1:32:00] is speaking of the very things you've
[1:32:02] been reading the very things you've been
[1:32:04] listening to
[1:32:05] he comes by he brings a preacher i don't
[1:32:07] know nothing about what you've been

[1:32:10] reading he comes and he speaks those
[1:32:13] very things to your heart
