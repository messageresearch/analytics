[25:13] &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 46.
[25:18] Psalm 46. If they can project that for
[25:20] us already. To the chief musician for
[25:23] the sons of Kora, the son upon Almouth.
[25:26] Okay, we can read together. God is our
[25:29] refuge and strength, a present help in
[25:32] in trouble.
[25:34] Therefore, will we not fear, though the
[25:37] earth move, and though the mountains be
[25:40] carried into the midst of the sea.
[25:43] Though the water thereof roar and be
[25:45] troubled, though the mountains shake
[25:48] with swelling thereof, Silla, there is a
[25:51] river, the streams whereof shall make
[25:54] glad the city of God, the holy place of
[25:58] the tabernacle of the most high. God is
[26:01] in the midst of her. She shall not be
[26:04] removed. God shall help her and that
[26:07] right early. The heathen rage and the
[26:10] kingdom were moved. The all the results
[26:14] and the earth melted. The Lord of hosts
[26:17] is with us. The God of Jacob is our
[26:20] refuge. Salah. Come behold the works of
[26:23] the Lord. What desolations he has made
[26:26] in the earth. He maketh war to cease
[26:29] unto the end of the earth. He breakth
[26:32] the bow and cutth the spear in thunder.
[26:35] He burneth the chariot in fire. Be still
[26:39] and know that I am God. I will be
[26:41] exalted among the heathen. I will be
[26:44] exalted in the earth. The Lord of hosts
[26:47] is with us. The God of Jacob is our
[26:50] refuge. Salah. Amen.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Hebrew chapter 12. Amen.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; What a powerful scripture there. My
[27:01] goodness.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 12
[27:09] verse 22.
[27:13] Uh let's let's start at 25. Sorry, I'll
[27:15] start reading at 25
[27:19] and then you don't have to read. I I'll
[27:21] read myself and we'll go a little faster
[27:22] here.
[27:24] See that you refuse not him that
[27:27] speaketh. That's a present tense.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; For if they escape not who refuse him
[27:35] that speak on earth, how much more
[27:40] shall not we escape? If we turn away
[27:43] from him that speaketh from heaven,
[27:46] still present tense.
[27:48] whose voice then shook the earth, but
[27:51] now he has promised, saying, "Yet once
[27:55] more, a shet not the earth only, but
[27:59] also heaven."
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[28:03] &gt;&gt; And his word yet once more signifyth the
[28:07] removing of the those things that are
[28:10] shaken as of things that are made.
[28:15] that those things which cannot be shaken
[28:18] &gt;&gt; may remain.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Now verse 28. Wherefore we receiving
[28:26] we receiving
[28:28] &gt;&gt; receiving it's a continuous right?
[28:30] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[28:35] cannot be moved.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Let us have grace whereby we may serve
[28:39] God acceptably with reverence and godly
[28:43] fear. For our God is a consuming fire.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we bow our heads just a few
[28:50] minutes? Lord, now this is your moment.
[28:52] Father, may you have your prayer in us
[28:53] now, Father.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; May you bless us in your presence in
[28:57] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Uh I hope that all of us are doing well.
[29:12] I I want to appreciate brother one
[29:16] uh for giving me the chance to be
[29:18] standing here.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Uh it's it's a it's it's a great
[29:22] privilege, you know. Uh I just pray that
[29:26] the Lord will help me this morning.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; I have a lot of thoughts
[29:31] uh that the Lord has been min has
[29:33] ministered to me. Uh few I don't know if
[29:37] it was few weeks ago. Uh I think we were
[29:41] just listening to the tape with the
[29:42] family. Every Thursday we listen to it
[29:45] and while we were listening to it, the
[29:47] Lord just gave me a thought. I didn't
[29:49] even know that brother one wanted me to
[29:51] speak.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; So as I'm I was listening to the tape,
[29:55] something just brother Benham says
[29:57] something that just shocked me. I mean I
[29:59] was like, "Oh my goodness, what all of
[30:01] this thing means?"
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Then I just pray about it. I think I was
[30:06] sitting by my wife. I stay quiet. I just
[30:08] took my note. I was just writing things
[30:09] down and and uh tonight I want to speak
[30:13] on born of a kingdom that cannot be
[30:17] moved.
[30:20] Born of a kingdom that cannot be moved.
[30:25] And I would ask you to pay attention.
[30:28] I'll try to slow down. If I go too fast,
[30:31] we're going to miss the point because it
[30:32] is very, very important. I mean,
[30:35] everything in the word of God is
[30:36] important. Is that right? Amen.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; But there are few things that I'm I
[30:40] don't know. I would just probably
[30:41] minister the way God put in my heart and
[30:44] just have your Bible ready because we'll
[30:46] be going back and forth because it's
[30:48] kind of hard for me to preach without
[30:49] the Bible. So, you know, I think it will
[30:52] help me a little bit to go fast here.
[30:54] Now,
[30:56] uh we we just read in the book of uh
[30:59] let's go back to the book of Psalms for
[31:00] a minute here. Psalm 46.
[31:04] You're happy to be here.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So if you know that it's the
[31:08] word, you can say amen. So feel free
[31:11] because when you say amen is so be it.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; You know it's the word of God is not my
[31:16] words. I can only read what the word
[31:18] says. Is that right?
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; The Bible begins to say our God is our
[31:23] refuge
[31:24] &gt;&gt; and strength. Right?
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Is a place our God is a place to run to
[31:30] for safety.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. is a protection from storm and
[31:35] enemies and even avengers of Avengers of
[31:38] blood
[31:39] &gt;&gt; or even danger. Is that right?
[31:42] &gt;&gt; It is a secure place and a a place of
[31:46] safety to be covered. Now in the Old
[31:49] Testament, a place of refuge, there were
[31:52] six cities of refuge. Is that right?
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Now six was on one side of the Jordan
[31:57] and six on the other side of the Jordan.
[32:00] So if it happens that you had killed
[32:02] somebody by mistake, you have to run to
[32:05] that city really quick. Are you with me?
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Because the avenger of blood will come
[32:09] and say, "Oh, this guy had killed my
[32:11] sister or killed my brother." They will
[32:13] come and run after you, right? And if
[32:15] you are innocent, you didn't do it, you
[32:17] know, willingly, you know, it just
[32:19] happened. Then you have to run to that
[32:20] city. And then God had had told Joshua
[32:24] or Moses if I'm not mistaken, you know,
[32:26] to to build those city so that whoever
[32:29] can run to can find refuge there.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; And God is our city of refuge.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; He is our servant city of refuge that we
[32:37] can run to.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; He's a place of protection. When the
[32:41] storm of life comes around, we can run
[32:44] to Jesus Christ.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; You see, that's the only place that we
[32:47] can go
[32:48] &gt;&gt; in this hour that we living in. There is
[32:50] not a specific city that we can run to.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Do we have a city like that?
[32:54] &gt;&gt; No.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Because sin is everywhere.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; There's nowhere else to run.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; But you know that you have a king,
[33:02] &gt;&gt; our Lord Jesus Christ that you can run
[33:03] to.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; And now David is saying, can you imagine
[33:07] is a man is seeing he knows the
[33:09] principle of the city of refuge. When he
[33:11] is into the presence of God, he's
[33:13] thinking or say God after I've read
[33:15] about the city of refuge, I found none
[33:17] around me. The only place I can go to is
[33:20] unto you.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; You see, you have to come to that place.
[33:24] You have to come to that conclusion
[33:25] where you look at your father, your
[33:27] mother, your brothers. There's nobody
[33:28] that can help you,
[33:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[33:30] &gt;&gt; But you have to look up.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; That's where your help will come from.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Don't expect anything from somebody.
[33:37] Look up to God.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; He's the only one who knows what is
[33:40] inside of your heart.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Even if you do not express it, God knows
[33:44] what is inside of your heart.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Glory. And he is your refuge.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is your hiding place.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; And he is the present help.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Not just the past help.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; He is the present help.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham says
[34:01] something. He says if he is infinite, it
[34:04] cannot be infinite without being omnip
[34:06] omnipotent.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; And he cannot be omnipotent without
[34:09] being omnipresent.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; He cannot be omnipresent without being
[34:13] omnisient. So if God shows up this
[34:16] morning,
[34:17] &gt;&gt; he carries all his power along with him.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; So if you believe that God is the same
[34:23] yesterday, today, and forever,
[34:25] &gt;&gt; you must also believe that he can deal
[34:26] with your situation
[34:28] &gt;&gt; because he cannot show up into a place
[34:30] and he say I'm present, but he's not
[34:32] omnipotent.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; No way.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; So once he is present there, he has to
[34:36] show his omnipotence.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see sometime we think
[34:41] God is present but yet we like oh no
[34:44] he's not going to do it. No if he is
[34:45] present then ask whatever you want.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Sometime we put God into a box
[34:52] &gt;&gt; and we go to that box only when we need
[34:54] it.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; But we can create an atmosphere like
[34:57] this morning
[34:59] &gt;&gt; and once he shows up then whatever you
[35:01] need God can give it to you.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; You know brother Brennham will preach is
[35:05] in the midst of the service he says the
[35:06] angel is there. Amen.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; The only thing he's asking people to do
[35:10] is to believe.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Because if the angel of the Lord is
[35:13] there, whatever you need, God can give
[35:15] it to you.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Because you are in the presence of the
[35:19] king.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Our God is present. He never been, you
[35:26] know, surprised by any event.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; So there's nothing that happened in your
[35:30] life that God does not know about.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; When something happened to you, you're
[35:34] so frustrated. You're like, "Oh, wow."
[35:35] You know, God, where were you?
[35:38] Does it happen to us? Is that right?
[35:40] &gt;&gt; We question say, "Man, Lord, I was just
[35:42] sleeping. I don't know what happened,
[35:45] &gt;&gt; but you don't realize that he knew that
[35:47] that thing had to happen."
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it would not be God.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; He knows the end before the beginning.
[35:53] So everything that you're going through
[35:55] is not a surprise to him.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; He's not surprised by any event.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what you're going
[36:02] through.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; God knows what you are dealing with.
[36:05] Amen.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; He's not surprised.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; He knows the end before the beginning.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; He does not help from far.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; He is near. He's present.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Right now in your situation,
[36:17] &gt;&gt; in your trial
[36:18] &gt;&gt; is wellproven help
[36:20] &gt;&gt; in time of trouble.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; How many of us believe that?
[36:26] &gt;&gt; You know, you don't just have to say
[36:28] amen. You have to really believe that.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; And after you have believed that, you
[36:31] have to confess it.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:34] Amen.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; You see, faith without work is dead.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; To prove your faith from your work.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; So if you truly believe, then confess it
[36:43] with your mouth.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Then if you confess it with your mouth,
[36:45] go do it.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; That will prove that you believe it.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[36:50] &gt;&gt; So if you say God will heal me, you
[36:53] believe God, then walk and confess that
[36:55] God has healed you.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; So if you cannot confess, it means that
[36:58] you have not believed there yet.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; That's as simple as simple can be. Amen.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[37:03] &gt;&gt; So if you believe it, prove it that you
[37:05] believe it.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Faith is not dead. Faith is in action.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Faith moves.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; You know, faith has has hair on the
[37:15] chest.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Faith is a person. You have to believe
[37:19] it.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible continually says, "Do not
[37:25] fear, though the earth be removed.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; The water roar and trouble mountains
[37:29] shake. Even if we see nations have been
[37:32] collapsing,
[37:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Who have seen it? Maybe you've been in a
[37:37] different planet.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Those that are on earth knows that
[37:40] there's a lot going on right now. Is
[37:41] that right?
[37:42] &gt;&gt; We can be honest about it. That's okay.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; You know, we having earthquakes that in
[37:48] diverse places, flood, disaster, ches
[37:50] and whatnot.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; And people are fearing, but God is
[37:54] telling you don't fear.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Because you have a God. Amen.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; People out there, they do not have a
[38:00] God.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; They're confused. They don't know what
[38:03] happened.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; But you know what happened?
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Because the word said it.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; You will wonder why did God allow all of
[38:11] these things?
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Did if your God was God, why is he
[38:14] allowing all of these things to happen?
[38:16] &gt;&gt; But you as a Christian, you would tell
[38:17] them don't worry about it. My God
[38:19] already said it will happen.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; So I'm not surprised by any event.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? So I should not
[38:27] fear
[38:28] &gt;&gt; because he have already said it
[38:29] &gt;&gt; and I know what will be the next move.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; That's why God has given us the word.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; We should not feed on social media. We
[38:37] should feed on the word because the word
[38:39] tells us what will happen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; We are not surprised.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; I mean if you are surprised about
[38:43] something that is happening means that
[38:44] you're not reading the word.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; That's true
[38:49] &gt;&gt; because God has said it.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; You should not you should not be shaken.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's right.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; To us, we were warned of these things
[38:58] that will happen in the world.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Now, if you watch the Bible, uh it says
[39:03] salah after that, right?
[39:06] &gt;&gt; It's a pause that you might reflect.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Salah means it's a pause. Stop a little
[39:13] bit and think.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Reflect on what was said.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; So, you see, God is the present help in
[39:23] need. Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; The earth will shake, but you will not
[39:26] shake.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; So if you are shaking, there was
[39:30] something wrong somewhere.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; You're not supposed to be shaking.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be standing and
[39:36] thanking God for what you have.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Christ. But the B the Bible says
[39:45] something here. If I can continue.
[39:48] Uh though the water there uh uh thereof
[39:51] roar and be troubled, though the
[39:53] mountain shake with swelling thereof,
[39:55] there is a river, the stream where shall
[39:58] make glad the city of God, the holy
[40:01] place of the tabernacle of the most
[40:02] high. Now the Bible says God is in the
[40:07] midst of her.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; You you catch that?
[40:14] &gt;&gt; So there is a shaking that is happening.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. But God is in the midst of her.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[40:22] &gt;&gt; She He is in the midst of her. She shall
[40:25] not be moved.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[40:28] &gt;&gt; She shall not be moved.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; God shall help her.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; And right early,
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Christ is with her.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Not just with her.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Christ is in her. Amen.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Not just a God that is around you,
[40:47] &gt;&gt; but a God that is in you.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; So when Christ is in you,
[40:53] &gt;&gt; you cannot fear.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Because he is in the midst is inside of
[41:00] you.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; You see, and she cannot neither be
[41:07] shaken or move.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; She's stable.
[41:11] Yes,
[41:12] &gt;&gt; and that speaks of the gentile bride
[41:14] &gt;&gt; in this last day.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Oh yes,
[41:17] &gt;&gt; this gentile bride would not move
[41:20] &gt;&gt; because the job has already been done.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a finished work.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Why are you moving? Why are you tossed
[41:29] about?
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Why are you crying? Speak the word.
[41:33] Because this is a time when the word has
[41:35] to be spoken.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Don't just say I believe it. Say it with
[41:40] your mouth.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Confess it. Because we have a high
[41:43] priest that can be touched by the
[41:45] feeling of your infirmity.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; You must confess.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; You must profess.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Is the same thing.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ, she is his
[41:59] temple on earth. Now,
[42:02] &gt;&gt; you are the temple. You are the
[42:03] tabernacle of God Almighty.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to see the eyes of
[42:08] God, don't look somewhere else.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; There is a body here of the believer.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; You know, the woman that said, "Oh my,
[42:17] I'm going a little off here." The woman
[42:20] that had the the blood issue came to
[42:22] Jesus and touch him.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus did not even know that that woman
[42:26] will come.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible says virtue came out of her.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Of him. Sorry. Hallelujah.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Oh, I feel that I'm weak."
[42:36] And Peter says, "There's a lot of people
[42:37] touching you."
[42:39] &gt;&gt; You know what what virtue is? Virtue is
[42:41] power.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Is strength.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; So somebody that is sick, that's why
[42:47] Paul that that scripture, right, to cut
[42:49] his own clothes and give to the sick.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Do you catch that in the book of Acts?
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Because he got it also from from, you
[42:58] know, they took the body. You know,
[43:00] remember Elijah?
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. the man that was dead that you know
[43:03] the throw is close to the the bone of
[43:05] Elijah and came back to life
[43:06] &gt;&gt; because there were power inside of that
[43:08] bone.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; So if you live a life for example if
[43:12] somebody has a need I'm standing here
[43:14] &gt;&gt; you have a need in your heart
[43:16] &gt;&gt; you can't touch God
[43:18] &gt;&gt; and I'll feel weak as I'm standing here
[43:20] &gt;&gt; that it would change my completely my
[43:22] sermon because somebody's inside he has
[43:25] a burden.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; So you're not touching me you're
[43:28] touching the high priest. Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; So my the job of a minister is just to
[43:33] be available.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; You see God want a willing body.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; A willing heart. Somebody that can say
[43:41] God here am I. I'm available.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; So he will use you. He will take you and
[43:45] move you everywhere he wants to.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Because the gift is not to just say
[43:51] things.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; The gift is to know how to yield to him.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; That's what a gift is.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. very important
[44:01] &gt;&gt; and she is a joint hair with him.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; She has the mind of Christ.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; She's standing strong and fearless.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; She has dust said the Lord in this age.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; She is the final voice under her
[44:14] messenger.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; That's what our power for this bride is.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Saints, you must come to realize who you
[44:21] are.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; You are the power that is shaking this
[44:25] hour. Amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Even at work,
[44:29] &gt;&gt; people look at you, sister,
[44:31] &gt;&gt; you're living right.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; You are shaking the life. You don't know
[44:34] that.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; But when they look at you and say,
[44:36] "Well, I wish I was that person."
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was something that
[44:40] God has has dropped in your heart that
[44:43] is different.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; It's to let to to let the world know
[44:48] that in this hour we have Christians.
[44:50] Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; It's not just how we can talk about it,
[44:54] but how can our life reflect Christ?
[44:58] &gt;&gt; In Antioch, they were called Christian
[45:00] because of the way they live.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; They saw how God Jesus was living. They
[45:04] say, "Oh, these ones are Christian."
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Because they could see the way they were
[45:08] talking. Said, "No, no, no. The way they
[45:10] live is different."
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; The hidden rage, the kingdom were moved.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; There were men in the scripture that
[45:23] tried to mess up with the people of God.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh stood up
[45:28] &gt;&gt; to defile the God of Israel.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; It says, "Who is the Lord that I should
[45:32] obey him?
[45:34] &gt;&gt; What happened to him?
[45:37] &gt;&gt; He was plagued
[45:38] &gt;&gt; with different sickness and pestimy and
[45:40] what not." At the end, death
[45:43] &gt;&gt; and many of his army got drowned. This
[45:46] is a man that is standing against God.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. Wow.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; This is a man standing against the
[45:53] people of God.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; You see, if you are under, if you are
[45:57] following the leadership of God, anybody
[46:00] that touches you touches God.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Because you are commissioned to fulfill
[46:05] something for this hour.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; So, anybody that will touch you,
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; will touch God directly.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; In Egypt, they saw a man called Moses.
[46:16] It was all walking. But yet, if you
[46:18] touch Moses,
[46:19] &gt;&gt; you touch the God of heaven.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; And in this room, there are people that
[46:24] you shouldn't touch.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; If you touch them, you touch God.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; You must know who you are.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Nobody has a right to touch you, saints.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; You came from God. Yes.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; God is incomplete without you.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[46:49] &gt;&gt; God is incomplete without you.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Saints, let let's stop a little bit
[46:55] here.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; In other nations, you know, they will
[46:59] post somewhere in the billboard, they'll
[47:01] put an animal, for example, a gorilla
[47:03] somewhere there, right? They say if you
[47:06] if you kill that gorilla, you're going
[47:07] to go to prison. Is that right? Amen.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; That gorilla is protected
[47:13] &gt;&gt; by the government.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; That's just an animal.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, God said, "Do not touch
[47:20] my anointed one. You a profit no arm is
[47:23] not a slip of."
[47:25] &gt;&gt; If a government can protect an animal,
[47:28] how much more are you?
[47:30] &gt;&gt; You worth more than an animal, man.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; You are a son and a daughter of God
[47:35] standing in heavenly places
[47:37] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ. You have to believe
[47:39] that. Say,
[47:41] &gt;&gt; "Oh, glory to God." How many of us
[47:43] believe that?
[47:45] &gt;&gt; You are a son and a daughter of God.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Nobody can touch you.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Not even Satan can touch you. No demon
[47:53] in hell can touch you.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; You are all powerful as your father is.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; You know, I I was pushing, you know, the
[48:06] stroller with my wife this morning.
[48:08] There was something that shocked me a
[48:09] little bit. I'm pushing the stroller. My
[48:11] wife was behind me and as I'm pushing,
[48:14] you know, and I told Joseph, you say,
[48:16] you know, Joseph was sitting in the
[48:17] front. So I told Joseph, please, Joseph,
[48:19] kick the door so you can't open it. But
[48:22] I was the one pushing. Joseph put his
[48:24] leg like this and he pushed he pushed
[48:26] and the door open. I told my wife, he
[48:28] said, I said, "Joseph push the door
[48:30] means that Joseph did push the door."
[48:32] But the power behind Joseph is not
[48:34] Joseph.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; It's me pushing the stroller. You see,
[48:37] it's the same thing with God.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; God will tell you, "Push the stroller.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; You just put your legs up. You push that
[48:44] door. You kick that door." But the power
[48:46] behind that. Oh, glory to God. It's God
[48:49] Almighty that is pushing.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; You see, when you look everywhere, you
[48:54] see God.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Even a little stroller.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You are a son of God.
[49:01] You are a daughter of God. You are more
[49:04] than able to speak the word that will
[49:05] come to pass. Amen. Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible speak of Sinazare, the king of
[49:14] Assyria. He mocked God
[49:16] &gt;&gt; and in the night the angel came and
[49:18] killed all the soldiers.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; It says because this man is trying to
[49:23] defile me.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the God of Israel.
[49:26] You know there are many nation that are
[49:28] destroyed. The God of Egyptians stood
[49:30] up.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; They were not able to solve you to save
[49:33] you. Do you think you Israel will stand
[49:34] before me? The king took that letter
[49:37] said, "Let me go to the temple."
[49:39] &gt;&gt; He went and kneel down. He said, "God,
[49:41] they didn't challenge me.
[49:43] [Music]
[49:45] &gt;&gt; They didn't challenge me. They
[49:47] challenged you, Lord."
[49:49] &gt;&gt; And God stood up. He says to your
[49:50] prophet, he says, "You go tell the king,
[49:53] &gt;&gt; oh, glory to God, I will kill that
[49:56] nation. I'll destroy them."
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Let people challenge your God.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't take it personal. No.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; When somebody step on your toe, don't
[50:06] take a person
[50:09] &gt;&gt; let him do what he does best.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[50:14] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[50:15] &gt;&gt; This man called me, king of Babylon.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Claim by pride. It says it claimed the
[50:22] glory belonged to him.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; He thought it was somebody.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; He was driven mad for seven years.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; You You don't take the glory. You know,
[50:30] everything that belongs to God belongs
[50:31] to him.
[50:32] Don't mess with that,
[50:34] &gt;&gt; you know. And what about
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Basosar?
[50:37] &gt;&gt; He took of he blasphemed by using the
[50:40] temple vessels,
[50:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:42] &gt;&gt; And say, "Oh, let me have a party with
[50:43] these ones."
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; The finger of God came out.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; And rode on the wall.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was a handwriting on the
[50:52] wall. The finger of God,
[50:55] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God was riding on the
[50:57] wall.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And that very same night,
[51:01] &gt;&gt; oh yes,
[51:02] &gt;&gt; he died.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; We have a powerful God.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; He stands for his people.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; He is faithful. And he said,
[51:10] &gt;&gt; David contin says,
[51:12] &gt;&gt; God altered his voice, the earth melted.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; When God speaks, everything moves.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; It says, "Let there be light."
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Everything that was laying dormat in
[51:24] darkness,
[51:25] &gt;&gt; it start coming in position in place.
[51:27] Everything start going back in order.
[51:29] Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you something. If
[51:31] there's darkness in your life, let it be
[51:33] light.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; God will bring order.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; He will bring everything in position in
[51:38] order
[51:40] &gt;&gt; by the power of the spoken word. He has
[51:42] already said it.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; But you have to believe it. As soon as
[51:46] you believe it, the action begins
[51:48] &gt;&gt; all the city, everything that was laying
[51:50] dormat in your situation, God start
[51:52] opening doors. You know, you didn't have
[51:54] a job and God start opening doors. You
[51:56] know, you didn't have children, God
[51:58] start opening doors. You didn't have
[52:00] blessing, God start opening the doors.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your children were lost and
[52:04] they start coming to the altar. Said,
[52:06] "No, I don't know what happened." Some
[52:07] God start opening the door because there
[52:09] is a father that is believing.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; God can open your situation tonight.
[52:15] This morning, if you only believe,
[52:18] &gt;&gt; you know, I came here for for a revival.
[52:20] You know, I woke up this morning. I
[52:21] said, "Lord, what do you have?
[52:24] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm here to have church. If you
[52:25] don't want to, I will have it.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "Be still and know that I am
[52:31] God."
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Don't, in other words, stop fearing,
[52:34] stop fighting,
[52:36] &gt;&gt; stop worrying,
[52:38] &gt;&gt; no means to recognize,
[52:40] &gt;&gt; and to understand is you should be
[52:43] exalted over all nations.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Be still.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Send come. Don't shake. Don't worry.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and know, recognize,
[52:55] &gt;&gt; believe,
[52:56] &gt;&gt; get to understand that this God that we
[52:59] had, oh my goodness, he will be the one
[53:01] being exalted
[53:04] &gt;&gt; in the midst of your situation.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; And one day, our Lord was tired on the
[53:08] boat. I haven't even touched my sermon
[53:10] yet.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; It's okay. If I don't touch it, that's
[53:12] okay.
[53:14] He was tired
[53:15] &gt;&gt; after a long sermon.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; He's coming there and his disciple got
[53:19] on board and then you know and Satan
[53:22] looks he said no today I'm going to kill
[53:23] this guy. He's sleeping. He thought he
[53:25] was just a normal man. He of course he
[53:27] was a man
[53:29] &gt;&gt; but a different type of man.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; It was 100% man and 100% God.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; But he was tired. Second look. Oh he's
[53:36] tired like the rest of the common
[53:38] people.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; But they didn't know date was there.
[53:42] The body was sleeping but God was not
[53:44] sleeping.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; You you see that that's the problem that
[53:47] we having.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; The demon comes at night says you know
[53:50] why this man is sleeping. They don't
[53:52] know the dates in me. He's not sleeping.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; There's a wicked standing and the angel
[53:56] of God are there standing ready with the
[53:59] sword.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You must know that there
[54:04] are angel that encampers around you.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; You are here because God did not allow
[54:10] the devil to touch you.
[54:12] Yes. Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; If he let loose, he just let his hand,
[54:15] something will happen to you.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; But God says no.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; He He has to be in church today.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Today is the day.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; He He has to hear these things.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; He has to get this blessing.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; God has to open a certain door for this
[54:28] person.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; This is your day.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; And one day, he was there sleeping.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; When they enter into the boat, he never
[54:37] promised his disciple there's not going
[54:39] to be a storm.
[54:40] Is that right? We're reading the Bible,
[54:42] right?
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Did you tell them, "Oh, be careful.
[54:44] There's going to be a storm. Maybe
[54:46] Satan, you know."
[54:48] &gt;&gt; No.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; The disciples say, "Here we are with the
[54:50] Lord. Let's just get in."
[54:53] &gt;&gt; That's why all of us have come this
[54:54] morning. We're just getting into the
[54:55] boat. You know,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; but we here.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; They went there.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Got into the boat. He never told them
[55:03] there's going to be a storm in your
[55:05] life. He never told you there's going to
[55:06] be disappointment.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. He never told you that
[55:09] your children will go away.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; He never told you that your marriage
[55:12] will have a problem.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; When you got married, you know, you get
[55:15] married to your wife, all is well.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Everything is fine. But he never told
[55:19] you what will happen down the line.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; For those that are getting married, they
[55:24] think like, okay, everything will be
[55:25] just flying ease. No, no, no, no, no.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; There are something that is ahead.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That's true.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; I have the responsibility to say the
[55:34] truth.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Bless.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; He never promised there's going to be no
[55:40] disappointment, no rejection, no
[55:42] affliction, no sickness, no trials,
[55:45] &gt;&gt; no headache, no challenges.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; He never told you that.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; But he is in the boat.
[55:52] [Applause]
[55:52] [Music]
[55:54] &gt;&gt; That's what matters.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; As long as he's there, that's we talked
[55:57] about being present, right? So if he is
[55:59] present in that boat, then that's a
[56:00] different situation.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; You need to check if Jesus in your boat.
[56:03] That's all.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; So if he is there, don't worry about it.
[56:06] Just do your thing.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Do your thing. He is your boat.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[56:11] &gt;&gt; He has to be in your marriage.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; If if he isn't there, don't worry about
[56:16] the sit. It will get dark. But listen,
[56:18] he he is in the boat.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In this church, we have to
[56:23] make sure that he is in the church.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; If he is present, the rest of the
[56:27] situation, don't worry about it.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Keep walking.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; That's good. Praise God.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; The king of glory was in that side of
[56:40] that boat.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; And when trouble came,
[56:44] &gt;&gt; what they had to do is to awaken Jesus.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus is sleeping.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; You must just awaken.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Because your situation will never
[56:58] change.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Until you awaken.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; You see the first point, make sure he is
[57:03] in the boat. Amen.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; But go and wake him.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Go and say, "Hey, Jesus, we're going to
[57:09] die. Please wake up."
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Now, they were sleeping.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Then he spoke to the storm.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; You see that part of God there?
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Spoke to the storm.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Do you know that that what was in Jesus
[57:27] Christ?
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[57:31] Everything that was in Jesus Christ, let
[57:33] me put it that way.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Is inside of his church.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Is that a word?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Is that a word?
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; In other word,
[57:47] &gt;&gt; deity
[57:50] &gt;&gt; is not in heaven.
[57:54] now
[57:56] &gt;&gt; is in the midst of his church.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; The true believer,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; filled with the baptism of the Holy
[58:02] Ghost,
[58:03] &gt;&gt; have dat.
[58:04] [Music]
[58:10] [Music]
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I feel like there are some people
[58:16] that not believing this.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; This is the word.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Ye are gods.
[58:23] That's the only thing I can I can't give
[58:25] you many. Let me help you with that one.
[58:28] [Applause]
[58:30] [Music]
[58:33] &gt;&gt; My my my
[58:36] &gt;&gt; good.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; The one that is inside of you
[58:42] &gt;&gt; is the one that created the heaven and
[58:44] earth.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; All the galaxies.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Because God works in humility. Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; You see that's one of the principle you
[58:53] must know about our God. When we pray
[58:55] God we think like oh my goodness it's
[58:57] big.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; He can actually condescend himself.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; He can. The brother says God has the
[59:07] desire
[59:08] &gt;&gt; to even to dwell inside of the worst
[59:10] prostitute in town.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; God want is somebody's heart.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. that is willing to condescend as
[59:22] low as men
[59:25] &gt;&gt; to say I want to save you
[59:28] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to live glory
[59:31] &gt;&gt; everything and I will come down and say
[59:33] I want to come into your heart
[59:36] &gt;&gt; if tonight this morning you have the
[59:38] desire to receive the Holy Ghost
[59:40] &gt;&gt; it's not just your desire
[59:42] &gt;&gt; God want to enter
[59:46] &gt;&gt; amen
[59:47] &gt;&gt; he has promis He want to get inside of
[59:50] your heart. Even if you don't want it,
[59:52] he's after you. I want to give you that
[59:54] Holy Spirit.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; But you just have to ask him.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Psalm 33:6, the word of the Lord.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; By the word of the Lord were the
[1:00:05] heavens, and the host of them by the
[1:00:08] breath of go of the of his mouth.
[1:00:11] He gathered the waters of the sea
[1:00:13] together. As a heap, he laid up the deep
[1:00:15] in the storehouse. Let all the earth
[1:00:18] fear the Lord. Let all the inhabitants
[1:00:20] of the the world stand in awe of him.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; He spake and it was done.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; He commanded and he stood fast.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; The Lord bringeth the counsel of the
[1:00:30] hidden to not. He maketh the device of
[1:00:32] the people of none effect.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; The counsel of the Lord shall stand
[1:00:37] forever.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; The thought of his heart to all
[1:00:40] generations.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; So if God taught it,
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. My prophet said it.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; God thought must be expressed. What is
[1:00:52] the word of God? Is the thought
[1:00:54] expressed?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; So if you were part of him in his
[1:01:00] thought,
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; what do you expect? You're going to be
[1:01:03] here.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; You would do what he intended you to do
[1:01:07] when you were yet in his thought. Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; So if you are believing the word of God
[1:01:12] today means there in his mind he knew
[1:01:15] that you will believe it.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Saint this is the power of this message.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; If God did not send a prophet we'll be
[1:01:24] in confusion.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; We must come to that place to realize
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; that our God is able.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; So my word Isaiah 55 11. Oh,
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; so my word be that goeth forth out of my
[1:01:40] mouth, it shall not return unto me void,
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; it shall accomplish that which I please,
[1:01:46] and shall prosper in the things there to
[1:01:49] sent it.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word of God,
[1:01:54] you know, in the book of Psalms here,
[1:01:57] even Hebrew chapter 4, it says the word,
[1:02:01] Hebrew 4:12,
[1:02:03] for the word of God is quicker and
[1:02:06] powerful,
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; that and sharper than any two-edged
[1:02:11] sword,
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; pursing even to the dividing ascent of
[1:02:15] the soul and spirit,
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; and the join and marrow, and is the
[1:02:19] discerner. It's a discerner
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; of the thoughts and intent of the heart.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; So even if you have an intention,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; the word of God can go deep inside of
[1:02:31] your heart and deal with that situation.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Maybe you have done something in secret
[1:02:38] that nobody knows about.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; When the word of God comes in the
[1:02:42] pulpit, it goes down there into that
[1:02:45] that area that you're trying to hide.
[1:02:47] Nobody knows about it. I'm gonna die
[1:02:49] with this.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; The word of God can go that deep.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; We can hide things from one another, but
[1:03:00] the word of God
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; can go deep into that area.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Saint, I want you to catch this because
[1:03:07] we're going to go in that area this
[1:03:08] morning.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:13] because we might actually miss heaven
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; because of that little tiny little bitty
[1:03:18] little thing
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; that is there.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; We're going to dig inside
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; just for by the grace of God.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; In Eden, God gave men his word. It was
[1:03:32] his safety. The Bible says in Proverbs
[1:03:35] say, "Every word of God is pure.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; He is a shield unto them that put their
[1:03:41] trust in him. In Eden, God gave them the
[1:03:46] word.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; We just read it. Is that right?
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; God gave them the word. It says, "Out of
[1:03:51] all the tree,
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; There's only a tree there you should not
[1:03:56] eat." Is that right?
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:04:00] the word of God was a safety boundary.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; You see, it's a place where you are
[1:04:06] protected. It's like your children. You
[1:04:08] keep them on the fence, right? Just
[1:04:09] making sure that they don't go outside.
[1:04:12] As long as they were there, nothing
[1:04:14] could happen to them.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; But Satan came in their midst,
[1:04:20] that serpent came.
[1:04:22] The serpent is, how many of us know that
[1:04:25] the serpent was an upright beast?
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; It could speak,
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; It could talk. For the matter of fact,
[1:04:33] it could have children.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Are we message believers?
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Because if we go deeper, I don't want to
[1:04:47] slow down and start looking at the
[1:04:48] scriptures, but we're not going to we're
[1:04:50] going to waste time here.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Uh, brother, can you give me Genesis
[1:04:53] chapter 2:15?
[1:04:56] And the Lord took the man and put him
[1:04:58] into the Garden of Eden to dress it and
[1:05:00] to keep it. And the Lord God commanded
[1:05:02] men, saying, "Every tree of the garden,
[1:05:06] thou may freely eat, but of the tree of
[1:05:08] knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
[1:05:10] not eat it." Is that right?
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Is it clear? Right?
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; God says, "Do not eat it."
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; You can eat all all of them. There's a
[1:05:20] lot of them. There were four kinds,
[1:05:21] right? Good for the eyes, good for food,
[1:05:24] the tree of life,
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; and the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:05:27] and evil.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; You can read it. I won't have time to
[1:05:29] read it. It's there. But the enemy came
[1:05:34] because this enemy that came into the
[1:05:36] saints, don't don't miss this. Very
[1:05:38] important, please. Somebody is sleeping,
[1:05:40] you shake them, and say, "Hey, something
[1:05:43] it's happening."
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Now, God told them not to eat. He says,
[1:05:47] "The day that you eat it, you will die."
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; And Satan came and took that body, the
[1:05:53] body of that beast,
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; because Lucifer was the one that was in
[1:05:58] heaven. Is that right?
[1:05:59] cast down because of disobedience.
[1:06:01] Right? Came on earth but his spirit.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; He has to find a body.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; He cannot dwell in a man. He has to use
[1:06:07] a beast.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Very important principle
[1:06:10] there.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Satan uses a beast to enter.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Very important. That's why they went
[1:06:18] into, you know, when the the spirits
[1:06:21] were cast out of the men from Gad
[1:06:23] Gadara,
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; they went into the
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; the swines. go sat and laugh love to
[1:06:29] enter into animals. If you need a quote,
[1:06:30] I can send it to you. Brother said
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; when he came
[1:06:36] in the garden of Eden, watch this. He
[1:06:39] never forced them.
[1:06:43] I want you to catch this. This is the
[1:06:45] way Satan comes.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm digging into things that we must
[1:06:52] understand.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; God Satan, sorry, let me put this. Satan
[1:06:56] does not force you.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; That's the first element you should know
[1:07:03] about Satan.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; He did not force Eve,
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; but he only twisted the word.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to catch this.
[1:07:18] Satan can just twist something
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; and he already gotten you.
[1:07:25] That's it.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Let's read it together here.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; He did not force her. He used deception
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; to cause Eve to reason with what God
[1:07:36] said.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; God said, "You shall not eat.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; It's clear."
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; But watch one element here. Deception.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis chapter 31.
[1:07:56] How many of us are happy to be in the
[1:07:58] house of the Lord?
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Please don't you shouldn't we shouldn't
[1:08:02] sleep. If you have your Bible, you know,
[1:08:04] let I think it's good also for all the
[1:08:06] young people, all of us, you know, we
[1:08:08] need to catch this. I think as I was
[1:08:10] reading it was a blessing to me.
[1:08:12] Now the serpent
[1:08:15] was the most subtle
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; than any beast of the field which the
[1:08:23] Lord God had made.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to focus on this word here.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Sar means shrewd, conning.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Having a certain wisdom, smart, crafty.
[1:08:37] In other words, brother Benham says in
[1:08:39] Hebrew they use the word maha in Hebrew.
[1:08:42] Maha you can read it in the message the
[1:08:45] serpent seed. But Benham says something.
[1:08:48] He says maha means having a true
[1:08:52] knowledge of the principles of life.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Can I continue again?
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; I'll repeat it again. a having a true
[1:09:04] knowledge of the principle of life. So
[1:09:09] he knows how life goes.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; He knows how the body of a woman is. He
[1:09:14] knows how the body of man is. He knows
[1:09:16] all of that. He knows that. He knows the
[1:09:19] principle of life.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; And he said unto the woman, "Yay,
[1:09:29] as God said." You see something wrong
[1:09:32] there?
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; God had already said something.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Is somebody catching this?
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Are we reading it together?
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Has God said, can you imagine you're
[1:09:46] standing in front of somebody, they
[1:09:47] already told you something,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; but did you really No, you heard me.
[1:09:52] Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Has God said, "Ye shall not eat of every
[1:09:57] tree of the garden." That's it. That's
[1:09:59] the only conversation you had.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; The woman said unto the serpent,
[1:10:09] "Yeah, we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:10:11] tree of the garden, but the fruit of of
[1:10:13] the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:10:15] garden, God said,
[1:10:17] you shall not eat of it, neither shall
[1:10:20] ye touch it, lest we die. Is that a
[1:10:22] scripture?
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Is it what God said?
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; For the matter of fact,
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; when Eve said it, God told Adam, God
[1:10:31] told the man of this commandment.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; So if Eve was able to quote that to the
[1:10:36] serpent, means that she might have heard
[1:10:38] it from Adam. From the
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Did she quote the scripture?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; But watch say that.
[1:10:49] And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye
[1:10:52] shall not
[1:10:55] surely die."
[1:10:57] That's it.
[1:11:01] So N
[1:11:03] is the only thing.
[1:11:06] God said that that
[1:11:10] you said that to that totally different.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; He didn't say that. He did not say that
[1:11:16] you shall not surely die. He said, "You
[1:11:19] shall show me that."
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; That's what God said.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; So when the enemy comes,
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; don't allow him to reason with you.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; You just tell him what the word said and
[1:11:31] walk away.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; But as soon as you start thinking, "Oh,
[1:11:37] really?"
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Did he really mean it?
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Because at that moment, you reasoning
[1:11:44] with the word
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; and that's what Eve did. She reasoned
[1:11:49] the day she opened her ear.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; She reasoned with the word and then that
[1:11:54] was it.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; For God doeth no that in the day he eats
[1:12:03] thereof. Now he adds a little bit more
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; in a formation that was not what God
[1:12:09] gave them
[1:12:12] because you you you actually
[1:12:16] inject a certain wisdom
[1:12:18] and then wait the person start reasoning
[1:12:21] you stop adding information
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; then what God did not say.
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Can we continue?
[1:12:34] For God knoweth that in the day you eat
[1:12:37] there off,
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; then your eyes shall be open,
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
[1:12:47] and evil,
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; but they were already gods.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; So once you don't know who you are,
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:13:02] So you are a Christian, the devil come
[1:13:04] and say, "Are you really a Christian?"
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; You start thinking and say, "Whoa, I was
[1:13:08] a Christian before the foundation of the
[1:13:09] world."
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; You must know who you are.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; They were already there.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; But Satan had an information that was
[1:13:20] not even needed.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And that's where Eve dropped all the
[1:13:24] barrier and Satan came in.
[1:13:32] Now I want you to catch this certain
[1:13:34] wisdom
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; how it works before I stop flying a
[1:13:38] little fast. Is that okay?
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; How many of us love the Lord?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[1:13:47] Six. When the woman saw
[1:13:54] that the tree was good for food,
[1:13:58] now you need to watch the language here.
[1:14:01] It was not an apple. Let me say it from
[1:14:03] the beginning. The here
[1:14:05] you will say, "Oh, brother, but it says
[1:14:09] good for food."
[1:14:11] There were four kinds of trees in the
[1:14:13] garden.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So, if you watch that trend, you'll
[1:14:16] figure it out why. Because the Bible
[1:14:19] says it's like a way of an adulterous
[1:14:21] woman.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; She eatth and say and wipe her mouth and
[1:14:26] say I have not eaten.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; So that eating that eating is not the
[1:14:30] eating of food.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; That's what we need in Malachi 4.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Now and that was pleasant to the eye.
[1:14:42] Watch this. and a tree to be desired to
[1:14:47] make one what?
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Wise.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; That wisdom is not God wisdom.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham says those three
[1:14:56] elements was the three assaults
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; that Jesus encountered in ma in Matthew
[1:15:01] chapter 4.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Satan brought him this very same three
[1:15:05] things. You know how Jesus overcome it?
[1:15:07] By the word.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] You see you you catching this?
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Maybe down the line we'll talk about
[1:15:15] that. But let's go to the book of James.
[1:15:17] James chapter 3:15.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; I need to go faster, right? Otherwise,
[1:15:20] we'll sleep here. James 3:15. The the
[1:15:24] wisdom
[1:15:26] descendeth not from above,
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; but but is earthly,
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; sensual.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Use this word very carefully here.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Sensual and devilish. Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; So the wisdom of Satan
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; is to to to begal you.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Now watch when God came down and said
[1:15:51] what what did you guys do? Right.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; If said the serpent begal me.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; That word begal means to lure to seduce.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; How can you seduce something to eat
[1:16:02] fruit?
[1:16:09] God wisdom is to stay with the word.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Satan wisdom is to twist it to make it
[1:16:16] say something that he does not say.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Anything that is not part of God
[1:16:21] original thought is a perversion.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Satan does not create. You have to
[1:16:28] understand these principles.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Satan does not create. He cannot create
[1:16:32] otherwise you'll be God.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I want to enter into
[1:16:36] something I'm going to hold myself.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; So, Satan does not create.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; He only perverts what God creates.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; You know that Satan and Lucif God and
[1:16:48] and Lucifer were very close, right?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; The but the Bible says the only thing
[1:16:54] was that Lucifer could not create.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; They were very close. But the only
[1:17:03] element there was creation.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I can't go deep into that, but I I'll
[1:17:10] hold it.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Sin is a perver perversion of
[1:17:15] righteousness.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; What is adultery? Is a perversion of the
[1:17:20] right act.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; What is a lie?
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Is the truth
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; perverted?
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So everything that you see here,
[1:17:30] it's a perversion of something else
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; of the original one.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot create, but he can only
[1:17:38] twist and pervert it.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And if he perverts it, then your mind
[1:17:42] goes there and you start going crazy.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; And out of that union between Eve and
[1:17:51] the serpent
[1:17:53] came out Cain.
[1:17:55] Let's go to first John chapter 3:15.
[1:17:59] Not as Cain, who was No, let's let's
[1:18:02] read it first.
[1:18:06] Amen. We can go faster. So we we go
[1:18:08] faster here. Okay.
[1:18:11] First John chapter 3:15.
[1:18:14] First John 3:15.
[1:18:21] Is that right? 1 John 3:15.
[1:18:29] Maybe
[1:18:32] first John 3 oh sorry twow
[1:18:37] 15 I say 15 so it's 12 here not as king
[1:18:42] who was of what
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; that wicked one
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; that slew his brother wherefore slew he
[1:18:49] him because his own work were evil and
[1:18:51] his brother righteousness
[1:18:54] The Bible says here it was of that
[1:18:56] wicked one.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; That wicked one was not him.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; The first quote exposition of the church
[1:19:04] age. The first quote there. Did you get
[1:19:07] it? Now these are two twins again. These
[1:19:11] are two trees again growing side by side
[1:19:15] in the earth. the same earth,
[1:19:19] partaking of the same nourishment,
[1:19:21] drinking in in some rain and
[1:19:23] beneficiaring by the by the same son,
[1:19:25] but they come from a different seed.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; One tree is for the word of from the for
[1:19:31] the word of God and exactly as God gave
[1:19:34] it. Love and obey it. The other tree is
[1:19:37] from the seed of the enter the word of
[1:19:40] God and change it where he wants you. He
[1:19:44] substituted his own creed and dogma for
[1:19:47] living true for living the true word of
[1:19:49] of God exactly as Cain and did Cain
[1:19:53] rather who ended up killing Abel. But
[1:19:57] fear not little flock. Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Fear not little flock. Stay with the
[1:20:03] word.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Keep that word between you what? And the
[1:20:06] devil.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; If did not do that she failed. And when
[1:20:10] the church let down on the word,
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; she goes into the depths of darkness of
[1:20:16] what? Of Satan.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Every time that we go away, we think we
[1:20:24] reason. That's it. We under the control
[1:20:26] of Satan.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible says 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:20:30] 1:20, "Where is the wise? Where is the
[1:20:32] scribe? Where is the dispute of the
[1:20:34] world? Has not God made foolish the
[1:20:37] wisdom of the world?"
[1:20:39] It contin after that in the wisdom of
[1:20:42] God the world by wisdom knew him not
[1:20:44] know knew not God he pleased God by the
[1:20:47] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:20:50] that believe.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe it?
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 3:15. Let no man deceive
[1:20:56] himself. If any man among you seems to
[1:20:59] be wise in the world, let him become a
[1:21:01] fool
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; that he may be wise. The wisdom of this
[1:21:05] world, watch this, the wisdom of this
[1:21:08] world is foolish, foolishness with God.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; For it is written, it taketh the wise in
[1:21:12] their own craft craftiness. And again,
[1:21:15] the Lord knoweth the thought or what of
[1:21:17] the wise, and they are vain.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; You hear people say, "Wow, I'm very
[1:21:23] smart. I'm very wise."
[1:21:29] But after that from that union
[1:21:32] came out Cain right Genesis 2:15
[1:21:37] God told Adam to tilt the soil right you
[1:21:39] can find it there
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; is to cultivate it right and you would
[1:21:43] watch that in the action of Adam his
[1:21:45] seed would do the same thing you know
[1:21:47] Seth will also you know kind of get it
[1:21:50] into agriculture right and of course
[1:21:52] still having you know in civilization of
[1:21:55] faith in terms of like they will believe
[1:21:56] God like Abel did. Is that right?
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; But of Cain they chose something quite
[1:22:01] different in Genesis chapter 4:15 4:16
[1:22:05] and Cain after he had killed Abel
[1:22:09] Cain went out from the presence of the
[1:22:11] Lord and dwelt in the land of Nad and
[1:22:13] the east of Eden and Cain knew his wife
[1:22:16] and she conceived and be Anosh and he
[1:22:19] built a city. So from the lineage of
[1:22:23] Seth we have agriculture. They focus
[1:22:26] more on agriculture. They were more on
[1:22:27] the agricultural civilization. On the
[1:22:30] other side of of of Cain they were
[1:22:32] building buildings.
[1:22:34] You see that
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; that's actually approximately 2,000
[1:22:38] years getting closer to Noah. Are you
[1:22:39] are you with me?
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Oh no. I mean after Adam. So we can't tr
[1:22:44] first in Genesis chapter 4:16.
[1:22:47] Are you with me?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And Cain went out of the presence of the
[1:22:52] Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod. I
[1:22:53] think I just read it. Right.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Verse 17 now.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And Cain knew his wife. Oh, I think
[1:23:00] let's go to 18.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And unto Okay, let me read it. Unto
[1:23:05] Anoch was born Aaron. And Aaron begat
[1:23:08] Jehel. And Jeera began Mashusel. And
[1:23:12] Mashus beg Lamech. Right. Continue.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; And Lamech took unto him to wife. This
[1:23:18] is the introduction of polygamy.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; It's not coming from the lineage of God
[1:23:26] people.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; This is coming from the children of of
[1:23:30] Cain
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; because it's the guy who introduced
[1:23:32] polygamy here.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Lamech took unto him two wives. The name
[1:23:40] of one was Adam and the name of the
[1:23:42] other was Zilah. Let's continue. And and
[1:23:46] Adam bomb. He was the father of such as
[1:23:50] dwelt in tent and such as of cattle. Is
[1:23:52] that right?
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; And his brother's name was Juba. He was
[1:23:57] the father of all such of what handle
[1:24:00] the AR and the organ.
[1:24:03] So all the musicians
[1:24:07] because the first one was more into
[1:24:08] business the stuff like that. This one
[1:24:11] is showing up with music and stuff. My
[1:24:13] goodness. Let's continue. And Zilla,
[1:24:17] she also bear tuba king an structure of
[1:24:22] all of every artificial in brass and
[1:24:24] iron.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; You you catch this right?
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. And the sister to was uh
[1:24:33] toain was uh nema.
[1:24:37] Is that right?
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Now you see from the lineage of Seth,
[1:24:40] the more into agriculture. Is that
[1:24:42] right?
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; No. because Adam was tilted the soil and
[1:24:45] all of it. In the other side, we having
[1:24:48] men that are more into, hey, let's build
[1:24:50] city,
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; let's build towers, let's do this
[1:24:53] artificial music and all. You watch
[1:24:55] that.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to trace every line of
[1:24:58] both of them separately.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Because we're getting somewhere.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; It will trace. It will bring us to
[1:25:03] today.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz the Bible does not lie.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; You know, I was reading this. I was
[1:25:10] sitting there say, "Oh my goodness,
[1:25:12] Lord, help me today.
[1:25:14] Let's read the message the ark.
[1:25:19] Brother says this.
[1:25:22] But if you notice, there come a great
[1:25:24] civilization through that what? The
[1:25:26] lineage of what? Of Cain. Are you with
[1:25:27] me?
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Back there that begin to come in. And
[1:25:32] when the men begin to multiply, they
[1:25:33] begin to go out after different
[1:25:35] education
[1:25:37] and so forth and discover the things
[1:25:39] what inventions.
[1:25:41] one great worker of wood. How they build
[1:25:44] big build uh begin to build and build
[1:25:46] and build and build that I mean was a
[1:25:49] sign of what?
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Of the end time.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; All of these things was the sign of the
[1:25:57] end time.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; So when you see city cities being built
[1:26:01] and all of it, it's a sign.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Is that a prophet? Amen.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Did you ever see like a building that
[1:26:08] got now it's again the sign of what the
[1:26:12] end time
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; they got great work of metals they
[1:26:16] discovered how they could and what they
[1:26:19] could do with metals. This was before
[1:26:21] the unto the living destruction.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; So sometime we have big building we
[1:26:26] think like we got it. No,
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; before
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; before the destruction or before the
[1:26:32] flood,
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; these people were even stronger than us.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; They had more technology that we got.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's continue.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. See
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; the next paragraph. Let's continue. Yes.
[1:26:47] And look what they're doing with the
[1:26:48] metal today. Even making I heard on the
[1:26:51] radio the other day making steel and
[1:26:53] metal houses. They cut all the timber
[1:26:55] practically so that they make them out
[1:26:58] of aluminum and and of steel and and so
[1:27:00] forth. Great discoveries of education
[1:27:03] and great going of science, progress of
[1:27:06] science, a sign of the end time.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Look what science has done in the last
[1:27:13] few years. Just the things that they
[1:27:16] done. What is it? Nearing the end time.
[1:27:20] A sign that that all believer watch
[1:27:23] this. That's when the minister come
[1:27:24] around.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Minister in the pulpit should be
[1:27:27] preaching it with all force
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; they got showing to the people.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; You see we have a responsibility
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; showing to the people we are passing
[1:27:40] milestone
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; and all things point to the end.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:50] So everything that we dealing with with
[1:27:52] everything that we did it's not new.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; The civilization before the flood was
[1:27:59] highly advanced.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; The they might have harnessed
[1:28:06] atomic and electrostatic
[1:28:08] energy in a destructive way.
[1:28:12] Say I'm an engineer. I think if we have
[1:28:14] engineers in in in the room right now
[1:28:16] we'll figure it out. That's true.
[1:28:18] So if you have metal, you have all of
[1:28:20] these things is easy easy to make an
[1:28:24] atomic bomb.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; How they were able to make pyramid
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; sphinxes how they were able to do it but
[1:28:32] we cannot do it today.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; They they had atomic power to do it.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham talks about it.
[1:28:40] Let's read it.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Perseverance.
[1:28:43] It says Noah was living in a scientific
[1:28:46] age when the world was perhaps could
[1:28:49] shoot the moon with a rod with radar.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Is it a prophet?
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Is it a prophet?
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the prophet? Right.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Here it is. It says Jesus said it was a
[1:29:02] day like this.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; As it was in the day what? Of Noah.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; So shall it be in the coming of what?
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Referring to what? this time.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Now we know down in Egypt we see the
[1:29:17] pyramid. They could not reproduce them
[1:29:19] today. We have no power to do that.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; They had a hold of what? Atomic power
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; or something of power that building you
[1:29:30] know built the pyramid. We could put
[1:29:33] those border up there by no mean neither
[1:29:36] could we produce that fixes. There is no
[1:29:39] way to do in of doing it. We don't have
[1:29:43] the material to make a mommy on ball a
[1:29:46] body that will look even natural for
[1:29:48] thousands of years.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Do you see that
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; we've lost that art?
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; They die that won't fade out. Many
[1:29:56] things that they had then that we are
[1:30:00] are completely blind off and they build
[1:30:02] that pyramid so sitting so scented in
[1:30:05] the earth no matter where the sun is
[1:30:07] there is is never a shadow around it. Is
[1:30:10] that right? How many of us have ever
[1:30:12] seen a pyramid?
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Hey, nobody have seen the pyramid.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm talking even in the picture,
[1:30:17] you know.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, people. You know, at least at
[1:30:22] least at least in the picture, brother.
[1:30:25] Cuz everybody went quiet. I'm like,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; all right. That's a good one.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my my Where was I?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Right here. Right. Oh, the art that
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Thank you. The instrument they
[1:30:44] had is far beyond now. Is that right?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; People had abused knowledge and power.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; That might have caused the shift of the
[1:30:56] some techni tectonic plates that caused
[1:30:59] the flood
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; because from Adam, if you calculate to
[1:31:04] Noah approximately is 2,000 years ago.
[1:31:07] 2,000 years and every 2,000 years there
[1:31:10] is something major that has to happen.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; And people had become so smart
[1:31:17] that destruction
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; was right there. They stopped playing.
[1:31:21] But the Bible even says men stop playing
[1:31:24] in God laboratory.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; They start doing things to destroy
[1:31:28] themsel.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; So you see what is happening today. It's
[1:31:32] not a new saint.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Look at the evasion. Look at whatever
[1:31:36] people are digging oil and all of these
[1:31:38] things
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; there is it's it's un it's bringing
[1:31:42] destruction in the earth. You don't even
[1:31:44] know
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; we are at the end saints
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; the world is falling apart.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; If you don't know that the world is
[1:31:53] falling apart
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; everything around us are falling apart.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; That's why we must seek a kingdom that
[1:32:01] cannot be shaken. Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; See, that's my title. Now,
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; we must receive a kingdom that cannot be
[1:32:10] shaken
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; because everything is shaking.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; In the time of Noah, everything was
[1:32:15] shaking.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:19] In another quote here birth pain
[1:32:23] people's science has brought into a
[1:32:25] great laboratory
[1:32:27] into God's great laboratory
[1:32:30] until they are going to destroy what
[1:32:33] themselves.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; God let always let wisdom destroy
[1:32:39] himself.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; God does not destroy anything.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; It says men destroy himself by what?
[1:32:46] Wisdom.
[1:32:48] And that wisdom is not of God.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Is the work of Satan
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; So if Cain had the seed of Satan in him,
[1:32:58] he had to produce the very thing that
[1:33:00] was Satan
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; of Satan
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; which include destruction.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; As he did what?
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Taking Satan wisdom instead of what?
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Can you see that?
[1:33:15] the world falling apart. When the world
[1:33:17] is falling apart in the time of Noah,
[1:33:20] God sent them a what? A mighty prophet.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; What did it do? They turned it down.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; So what the end was coming, God sent
[1:33:33] them Noah. Are you with me?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; God sent them Noah with a message,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; but they turned it down.
[1:33:44] God can do nothing
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; without revealing his secret
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; to his servant the prophet
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amos chapter 3:7
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; and the Lord you know 1st Samuel 3:21 if
[1:33:58] we can post that that scripture really
[1:33:59] helped me
[1:34:02] 1st Samuel 3:21st
[1:34:08] Samuel 3:21 the Lord at watch This
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; the Lord appeared again in Shiloh. You
[1:34:16] see that?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; For the Lord revealed himself.
[1:34:23] Watch this. The For the Lord revealed
[1:34:27] himself to Samuel in Shiloh
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; by the word of the Lord.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[1:34:39] So God gives his word to a prophet.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; He reveal himself by the word to a
[1:34:46] prophet and the prophet has to speak the
[1:34:49] word to the people.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing that?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh in Jesus.
[1:34:56] Are you with me?
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm bringing another principle here.
[1:34:59] John chapter 1. In the beginning was the
[1:35:01] word. The word was with God. The word
[1:35:03] was what? Was God. And John 1 verse 15
[1:35:08] 14 the word was made flesh in Jesus. Is
[1:35:11] that right?
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Now if you you notice Jesus as he was
[1:35:16] coming to John John the Baptist
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; the word which was Jesus in flesh
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; had to go to a prophet.
[1:35:25] Now watch let's read it together.
[1:35:29] Matthew chapter 3:15.
[1:35:31] Then come Jesus from Galilee to Jordan
[1:35:34] unto John to be baptized. But John for
[1:35:38] forbade him saying, I I have need to be
[1:35:41] baptized of thee.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Cometh thou to me? Okay. And cometh thou
[1:35:47] to me as a question, right? And Jesus
[1:35:50] answering said unto him, suffer it not
[1:35:53] to be so. For thus it cometh becometh us
[1:35:59] to fulfill all righteousness.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; The word that was the word that was made
[1:36:04] flesh
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; had to come to a prophet.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You you got that principle
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; is the same principle.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; The word of God comes to a prophet to
[1:36:16] fulfill all righteousness.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And here you watch this. Jesus come John
[1:36:21] says no you are the one that need to
[1:36:22] baptize me. Jesus says no, he can't
[1:36:25] break the word.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; The word must come to a prophet.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; So s is the same thing the revealed word
[1:36:33] for this day.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the word made flesh had to
[1:36:37] come to you.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; He had to come had to be revealed to a
[1:36:42] prophet and the prophet had to speak the
[1:36:44] word.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; It's the same principle.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; It's the same principle.
[1:36:52] The word comes only to a prophet,
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; not to an evangelist or a pastor or
[1:36:58] anybody.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord for such age as
[1:37:01] this
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; only come to a prophet.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; You see somebody say, "Oh, you know, I
[1:37:09] don't need a prophet. I can just read
[1:37:10] the Bible myself." How can you
[1:37:12] understand this Bible with a prophet?
[1:37:16] You cannot understand because the a
[1:37:18] prophet is an interpreter of a divine
[1:37:20] word of God.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; He looks at the word it tells you what
[1:37:24] happened.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; You say but how is it? He says no. For
[1:37:28] example, you come and say the Bible says
[1:37:30] Eve was there. Adam was there when Eve
[1:37:33] ate the fruit. Right? But the bottom
[1:37:36] says Adam was not there
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; because in the morning Eve went with the
[1:37:43] serpent
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; and the evening he went with your
[1:37:46] husband.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Only a prophet can see that
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; said we are privileged in this time that
[1:37:56] we living in.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; That's why we should feed on the word of
[1:38:00] God.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; It will solve all our problems around.
[1:38:04] Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Go chapter six. Remember every falling
[1:38:08] generation.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Let me let me continue that quote I was
[1:38:14] reading.
[1:38:19] The word of the Lord comes to a prophet
[1:38:21] is the word of God. Again in the time of
[1:38:23] Noah they sent it. Moses time the whole
[1:38:28] system was falling apart. They sent a
[1:38:30] prophet and Elijah in his time the whole
[1:38:32] system was falling apart. They send a
[1:38:34] prophet every time when the word the
[1:38:37] world catch this get into the into
[1:38:40] disguise they send a prophet. God sent a
[1:38:44] prophet.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; And the next quote six it says remember
[1:38:50] every falling generation there's only
[1:38:52] one thing that God can bridge this world
[1:38:55] together. Bridge this world together.
[1:38:58] Is that right?
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; He says that's the word of God.
[1:39:03] It continues. It says, "This word was
[1:39:05] made by the word of God.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; It's framed together by the word of
[1:39:11] God." That's the only thing that will
[1:39:13] ever keep it together is the word of
[1:39:16] God. For the Hebrews said, "We
[1:39:18] understand that the world will frame by
[1:39:20] the word of God." People doubt the word
[1:39:22] of God and the very the very dirt that
[1:39:27] you are sitting on
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; is the word of God made manifest.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; The very seat that you are sitting in is
[1:39:37] the word of God made manifest.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; God speak it and then it has to happen
[1:39:43] because it is the word of God. Even the
[1:39:46] the the the wood that you're sitting on,
[1:39:48] the chair,
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; God spoke it,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; are you with me? Everything that is
[1:39:54] around us,
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; it was framed by the word of God. So we
[1:39:59] should not sit and question the word of
[1:40:01] God.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; The following God gift always find a
[1:40:04] place.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; The whole creation was lost and we just
[1:40:08] went through in the seven seals. See,
[1:40:10] the whole creation was lost. Everything
[1:40:13] was gone. He all belong to Satan. But
[1:40:16] he's talking now.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; It says he fell.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because Yeah. Let me let me
[1:40:26] because the same quote but it continues
[1:40:28] here. It says every government, every
[1:40:31] king, every kingdom controlled by Satan.
[1:40:36] The whole world is controlled and run by
[1:40:39] Satan. Let me continue here. says every
[1:40:42] person that works in it
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; maybe we say oh wow our government you
[1:40:47] know man this government will be better
[1:40:49] you know how we do in Africa for
[1:40:50] instance we expecting the nef government
[1:40:53] to come and we say wow things will get
[1:40:55] better
[1:40:56] watch what the prophet is saying
[1:40:59] politics corrupted
[1:41:02] democrat republican and all is low down
[1:41:04] what it is it's a bunch of craft every
[1:41:07] person that works in it
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; that's not born again
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; is of the devil.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Are you you saying
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; The devil says every kingdom in the
[1:41:20] world belong to me.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And Jesus never debate him with it.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; The word is controlled by what? The
[1:41:28] devil. And every man that works for the
[1:41:31] government, if he isn't a Christian,
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; it's of the devil and working for the
[1:41:38] devil.
[1:41:40] Is that the word of God?
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; So we must be very careful.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; And the people come, let me drop into
[1:41:50] something here. The level of corruption
[1:41:52] in the time
[1:41:54] of Noah.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Genesis 6:5. And God saw the weakness of
[1:41:58] men was great in the earth that every
[1:42:00] imagination of the thought of the heart
[1:42:02] was only evil continually. Amen.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, the deprivation, the the
[1:42:08] depravity, the intent of the thoughts
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; were evil, the imagination, the purpose,
[1:42:14] the desire. Sin was no longer
[1:42:16] occasional, occasional. It was constant.
[1:42:20] It had become the way of life.
[1:42:23] And what is sin? Sin is just means
[1:42:25] missing the mark.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; It's unbelief.
[1:42:30] People's heart, imagination, desire will
[1:42:33] feel full of violence, lust, greed and
[1:42:36] all rebellious before God.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; You see everything that we seeing on the
[1:42:40] street now, killing and all of it's not
[1:42:42] new.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said as he was in the time of
[1:42:46] Noah, so shall it be. Is that right? And
[1:42:49] that's what we're seeing.
[1:42:51] Let's go to Genesis chapter 6:2. The
[1:42:53] sons of God, watch this. We're getting
[1:42:55] to something here now.
[1:42:58] We we talked about the world in terms of
[1:43:01] the earth and all how men is destructing
[1:43:03] destroying themselves through technology
[1:43:05] and whatnot. Is that right? We talked
[1:43:07] about you know uh the corruption as well
[1:43:11] right
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; the mind of men. Now let's dig about
[1:43:14] this. The sons of God in other words the
[1:43:17] sons of Seth.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Now we coming to a place where God said
[1:43:24] enough is enough. Yeah.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the sons of God.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; The son from the lineage of Seth,
[1:43:35] not from Cain.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; From the lineage of Seth
[1:43:40] took the daughter of men. Brother says
[1:43:43] they took the the daughter of Cain.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; The sons of God
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; took the daughter of men that they were
[1:43:54] fair. They're like beautiful woman.
[1:43:56] Brother Benam, another message says
[1:43:57] that's a proof of the end too.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; The beauty. Everybody want to be
[1:44:01] beautiful.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Now we going on the street. There's a
[1:44:05] lot of paint in the face everywhere.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, am I saying something wrong here?
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Is it Is it not true?
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Because that's a spirit of Jezebel.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; That's a spirit of Jezebel. She's the
[1:44:18] one that's a hidden thing.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; That's for another day.
[1:44:24] Now the sons of the lineage of Ken took
[1:44:27] the woman started living with them.
[1:44:32] Are we now seeing it today?
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Sons of God, Christians,
[1:44:40] they will go and say, "Wow, I see this
[1:44:42] beautiful woman.
[1:44:44] Maybe not marry them, just live with
[1:44:46] them.
[1:44:48] This is the son of the end."
[1:44:51] Saints, if nobody tells us these things,
[1:44:53] tell us these things, we're not we're
[1:44:54] going to leave any type of way.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; But this is the church of the living
[1:44:58] God.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; From this pulpit, the truth must come
[1:45:02] out.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; And I don't think brother one
[1:45:04] compromise.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Why would I do it?
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Say that's why we have to repent.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; If he those one did not escape, we will
[1:45:18] not escape.
[1:45:21] Is that right? Do you believe that?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; It's not to condemn anybody. It's just
[1:45:24] that God need to help us.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; As the church of the living God, even as
[1:45:29] we standing together, praying together
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, help me."
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; That's why we must pray for one another.
[1:45:35] You don't know what your brother is
[1:45:36] dealing with.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; You don't know what your sister's
[1:45:38] dealing with, pray for her.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Don't just wait for somebody to happen,
[1:45:42] then you start, "Oh, wow. Why did he can
[1:45:43] do why are they doing this?"
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; But we spend time to pray for them.
[1:45:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Because the end is coming. You don't
[1:45:51] want this situation to happen,
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; There is something that really caught my
[1:45:57] attention here. You would watch when
[1:46:01] Noah because when Noah entered into the
[1:46:04] ark, there were only eight people that
[1:46:06] were saved. Is that right?
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; But you would wonder where are all the
[1:46:11] sons of Sad?
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; And I was just reading. I thought about
[1:46:17] it. I said, "Whoa,
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; what about all the lage of the sons of
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Seth?"
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Only eight.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; That shocked me just for a minute.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; You can say I'm a Christian,
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; but how many of us
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; will be there?
[1:46:48] That's why saint where we come into
[1:46:49] church
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; is because we need more of God. It has
[1:46:52] to be a relationship.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Say Lord please help me.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; You crying every day Lord I don't want
[1:47:00] to miss that day. Not out of fear
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; but to do something for me. You know you
[1:47:04] have love for God. You don't want to
[1:47:06] hurt his feeling.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Only eight were able to make it.
[1:47:14] My my my Lord have mercy on us.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; You know, before Noah, it never rained
[1:47:20] before. Is that right? How many of us
[1:47:21] believe that?
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Genesis 2:5, we can read it.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; No rain before
[1:47:29] and after that it rained.
[1:47:32] The Bible says in Genesis chapter 7:11,
[1:47:35] in the 600 years of Noah's life, the
[1:47:40] second month, the 17th day of the month,
[1:47:42] the same day where all the fountain of
[1:47:45] the deep broke up
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; and the windows of heaven were open, may
[1:47:52] rain crazy.
[1:47:55] Fellowship
[1:47:58] the message fellowship.
[1:48:02] I'm coming to to close. Is that right?
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord here?
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; May God help us. Right. All of us need
[1:48:08] God's help. Is that right?
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Uh quotes number nine.
[1:48:15] I'm coming there so we can finish here.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. There's a lot going on
[1:48:20] here. All right.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's no nine. Put
[1:48:25] nine, please.
[1:48:27] Oh, there's no nine. Oh,
[1:48:31] that's fine.
[1:48:34] There's only 10 there. Okay, that's
[1:48:36] fine. I'll read nine. It says, "Now,
[1:48:38] I'll say it as a servant." But what I'm
[1:48:40] saying here, I'll say as a servant of
[1:48:42] the Lord, I believe that it could happen
[1:48:45] at any time.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Total annihilation.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; It could start at any time. Look as in
[1:48:53] the day of Noah. That's how they throw
[1:48:56] the world out of it bound in the days of
[1:48:59] Noah when they built pyramid and fences
[1:49:02] and and so forth. They couldn't build it
[1:49:04] today if we had to. Gasoline power,
[1:49:07] electric power won't build it. You see
[1:49:10] that?
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying but says but atomic power
[1:49:15] will
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; but we don't have atomic power.
[1:49:20] But in that time they were able to have
[1:49:22] it.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Did you see that?
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; So they could turn it loose. What? What?
[1:49:28] What am I saying? My It says they could
[1:49:31] turn it loose and suck the world from
[1:49:35] its orbit
[1:49:37] and it begins
[1:49:39] went out and caused moisture. Brother
[1:49:42] Benham is telling us what had caused
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; the flood.
[1:49:48] You know, I went down and studied this a
[1:49:51] little bit because I love stuff like
[1:49:53] this. So, I went to study figure it out.
[1:49:55] How was it posit possible? I came out to
[1:49:58] find out. Yes, brother is right.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; I don't want to get into it,
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; but he was right.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Let me continue.
[1:50:08] It says, "And I hated
[1:50:11] moisture that covered the whole earth."
[1:50:14] He says, "This time is going to blow it
[1:50:18] into the sun."
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Just exactly scientifically, right
[1:50:24] across the center, the way God said it,
[1:50:27] it would happen. Here it is. We are at
[1:50:30] the the end time and men are still
[1:50:34] unprepared.
[1:50:39] Saint, as we sitting here this morning,
[1:50:43] there's triggers of atomic bomb in
[1:50:45] people's head.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe we sitting here, we're worshiping.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot of things happening
[1:50:51] around the world.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; It will just take one person to press a
[1:50:55] button.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; But for you,
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; you are promising.
[1:51:04] The world can shake in destruction,
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; but you cannot shake
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; because you are born, we'll get into it.
[1:51:11] You are born into that kingdom
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; that before anything could happen, the
[1:51:17] Lord will take you home.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; God would not allow his elect to go
[1:51:22] through such things.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; But I'm glad to say when the world was
[1:51:27] shaking, there was a man called Enoch.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; He was the seventh from Adam. He was
[1:51:32] raptured.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, you know, the Bible says
[1:51:36] Enoch walked with God and he was not.
[1:51:39] And God took him
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; by faith. Enoch was translated that he
[1:51:44] should not what? See death and was not
[1:51:47] found because God has translated him.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; For before his translation, he had this
[1:51:56] testimony that he pleased God.
[1:52:00] Hallelujah.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Enoch was the seventh. But the but the
[1:52:04] one was reading here. Watch the seven.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; You catch this.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; The seven need to take be taken home.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; The promise of the right is for the
[1:52:13] bride.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Soon enough here she'll go home.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; This is the time of the bride. She she
[1:52:21] isn't a civilization of faith.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; She believe our work the whole word of
[1:52:26] God.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; She's not shaken.
[1:52:29] Is that right?
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; If God decide for you to die here in a
[1:52:34] moment in the twilling of the eye
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:52:39] sound
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; and the death shall be raised
[1:52:42] incorruptible and we shall be what?
[1:52:45] Changed
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; is that right?
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; For the corruptible must put on a
[1:52:51] corruption and the mortal must put on
[1:52:53] immortality. So when the corruptible
[1:52:56] shall have to put on a corrupt or even
[1:52:58] corruption. This model shall have to put
[1:53:02] on immortality
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; and then shall
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; to pass the saying that is written,
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; death is swallowed up in victory.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians 4:16,
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:53:19] heaven with a shout. What is the shout?
[1:53:22] The message.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; The message is coming forth.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. has come forth.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; With the voice of the archangel, with
[1:53:33] the trump of God, the death in in Christ
[1:53:36] shall rise first.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Shall be caught up together with them in
[1:53:45] the cloud to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:53:48] So shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; There is a promise that belong to you.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:26,
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; as it was in the day of Noah, so shall
[1:54:03] it be in the day of the son of man.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; They did eat the drunk and the merry
[1:54:08] wives.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; You see that
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; the merry wives, they were given in
[1:54:13] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[1:54:17] to the ark, the flood came and destro
[1:54:19] wife, destroyed them all. Likewise also.
[1:54:22] I like that.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Likewise.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; It looks like the sim the similar thing,
[1:54:27] right?
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; But it's there for a purpose.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Likewise also it as it was in the day of
[1:54:34] Lot.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; What happened in the time of Lot?
[1:54:37] Perversion.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Is it not what we seeing?
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; They did eat. They drunk. They they
[1:54:47] bought and and sold it. They planted.
[1:54:49] They build it. Let's continue.
[1:54:52] But the same day that Lot went out of
[1:54:54] Sodom, he rained fire and bring storm
[1:54:57] from heaven and destroyed them all.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; So if God does not bring destruction for
[1:55:02] this generation, he has to go back and
[1:55:04] repent for this.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; But God cannot repent.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:55:12] When brother Brennham was preaching I
[1:55:13] think did the choosing of the bride if
[1:55:15] I'm not mistaken he spoke about Los
[1:55:18] Angeles
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; said do you remember Pompe India what
[1:55:22] happened there he says you Los Angeles
[1:55:25] you go down in the sea saint we living
[1:55:28] in the time
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; we must be prepared
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; as brother Venham says there's this all
[1:55:34] this atomic bomb is going around he says
[1:55:36] people are still unprepared
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; we are still distracted oh wow I have to
[1:55:41] do this. I have to build this big house.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; What about our soul?
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; We worry about different things,
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; some little bitty things left and right.
[1:55:51] What about your life?
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; What about your relationship with God?
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; The young people, they're looking for
[1:55:58] the next boyfriend.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; The young boys say, "Oh, wow. I want to
[1:56:02] have a beautiful girlfriend."
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; It's time to be on your knees and pray.
[1:56:08] Because if all our parents all of of our
[1:56:10] parents that they gone, who's going to
[1:56:12] stand?
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Who will we even know that there was a
[1:56:15] man called William Brandon? Sometimes
[1:56:17] parents don't realize it.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; If we go that our children will know
[1:56:20] what we stood for.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe this church will be closed.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Our young people are dying. I know what
[1:56:33] I'm talking about. Amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; There are things that I'm telling you
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; there's a lot going on.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; There's a lot going on. I don't think if
[1:56:43] the parents have an idea what's going
[1:56:45] on.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot going on.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; May God awaken our spirit.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; That as we come in here, we see Lord I I
[1:56:54] I want to receive that kingdom.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; So that even if I die, I know where I'm
[1:56:59] going.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Even if the rapture takes place, I know
[1:57:02] where I'm going. Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I don't want to just go alone.
[1:57:05] I have my children, too.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to leave anybody behind.
[1:57:09] I'm going to carry with them. So what
[1:57:11] you do, you create an atmosphere that
[1:57:13] not even one of your loved ones
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; will stay behind.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; So if you care about your children,
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; you should fight for them as well.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost in you will not
[1:57:26] allow anybody to go to hell
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; or anybody to be lost.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Mhm.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; You will do everything in your power for
[1:57:34] that person to be saved.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Then let's do it for our loved ones,
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; for our children.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Our loved ones,
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Abraham's group, when judgment was
[1:57:47] falling,
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham was not even there. He was
[1:57:50] secure somewhere.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Abraham was secure somewhere.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; He could only hear judgment fire falling
[1:57:59] over there. But Elohim step in human
[1:58:02] flesh.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; He was there talking to Elohim
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; interceding for his brother Lord.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; He was in God.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; He was hidden in God.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; He was protected in God.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; And those of ham as well
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; will be protected.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know I'm speaking a
[1:58:27] different language,
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; but those that will catch it catch it.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; They are protected.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Our father Abraham
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; was looking for a city
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; which has a foundation.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whose builder and mecca is
[1:58:52] God.
[1:58:54] There's something here I want to read.
[1:58:56] Genesis 18:18. Seeing that Abraham shall
[1:58:59] surely become a great nation. That's God
[1:59:02] Elohim speaking.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; It says, "And all the nation of the
[1:59:06] earth shall be blessed but in him. I
[1:59:08] know him."
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Let's have amen.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; For I know him
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; that he will command his children.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. and his household after him.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; And they shall keep the way of the Lord
[1:59:34] to do justice and judgment that the Lord
[1:59:38] may bring upon Abraham that which he has
[1:59:42] spoken what of him.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Not just Abraham, he would teach his
[1:59:47] children.
[1:59:50] You see that
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; if our father Abraham taught his
[1:59:55] children, why are we having a problem as
[1:59:58] sons of Abraham to teach our children?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Something is wrong somewhere. You you
[2:00:03] catch you catching this?
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel were in Egypt.
[2:00:10] They were in a secure place in in Gan.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Darkness was in Egypt. Death was
[2:00:16] striking Egypt.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were under the blood.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; They were protected under the tokens.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; They were citizen of a city
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; which build and make is God.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; They could not be touched.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Even if they were in bondage for many
[2:00:31] years,
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; but yet they were protected.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; God takes care of his children.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; He's a responsible father.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; He's a responsible father. Yes,
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Elijah.
[2:00:46] He was sitting there.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Jezebel came to kill, you know, to kill,
[2:00:50] trying to kill all the prophet and all
[2:00:51] of it.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Elijah was running away from a woman.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; This woman was coming and say, "I'm
[2:00:59] going to destroy all the prophet. She
[2:01:01] brought idolatry into Israel." And what
[2:01:04] you know the story, right?
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Then there was something that Elijah
[2:01:08] said here.
[2:01:10] First Kings chapter 19:10. He said, "I
[2:01:13] have been very zealous for the Lord God
[2:01:15] of hosts. And the children of Israel has
[2:01:17] forsaken the covenant. Throw down the
[2:01:19] altar and slay the prophet with the
[2:01:21] sword and I." Do you see that?
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; I if and I only left. I'm left and they
[2:01:29] seek my life to take it away.
[2:01:32] In verse 18, let's go to 18. Then God
[2:01:35] speaks to Elijah. It says yet
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; I have left
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; me.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Oh glory.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; God would have a remnant.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It says, "Yet I have left me
[2:01:57] 7,000 in Israel, all the knees which
[2:02:01] have not bowed unto bear,
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; and every mouth which have not kissed
[2:02:07] him."
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; If you don't stand, God will have a
[2:02:13] remnant to stand.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Even if you say, "Oh, I don't care about
[2:02:19] this message."
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; God will have people
[2:02:23] Oh, glory to God.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; If you say, "Man, I don't care what,"
[2:02:28] don't worry about it. God will have his
[2:02:31] people.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; God cannot be stopped because of your
[2:02:35] unbelief. Unbelief does not stop God.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; He's still moving.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; The cloud is still moving.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; The pill of fire is moving.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; And all the children of God are lining
[2:02:48] up looking facing to the word.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; You know a magnet.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; When a magnet is passing around.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Right. There's plastic and whatn not.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; You can't even find stainless steel.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; When the magnets magnet come, he only
[2:03:07] picked up those that can be magnetized.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Elijah? Elisha,
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; you know, he meets Elisha. Elijah,
[2:03:18] he they just talk to him. He says, "Hey,
[2:03:21] wait, wait, wait. Let me let me let me
[2:03:24] leave everything." They didn't even say
[2:03:26] a word.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; He just touch him and he follow him.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Magnet.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; This word is a big magnet.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; You were in the world. You walking any
[2:03:39] type of way. You just hear that. Oh, God
[2:03:41] sent a prophet. You say what? You start
[2:03:43] walking
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; without even questioning. Hallelujah.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; The word of God is a great magnet
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; and it's coming into this building
[2:03:52] convincing the heart of every one of
[2:03:54] you. It's not me. I'm just a human
[2:03:56] being.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; But the word is bringing conviction into
[2:03:59] your heart.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; God is healing the sick in our midst.
[2:04:09] You don't even feel it.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Can you wake up the sister, please?
[2:04:15] Amen.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; In the time of Jesus,
[2:04:22] the Jews thought that there was a
[2:04:25] kingdom that had to come. Is that right?
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; A great kingdom
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; with a, you know, they were expecting a
[2:04:31] general. Oh no. This man will come like
[2:04:34] Solomon. You know, he will bring, you
[2:04:36] know, h, you know, wealth into this
[2:04:39] country and all. That's what they were
[2:04:40] thinking. That was the conception of how
[2:04:43] the Messiah should come.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; You know, God works in simplicity.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Then we just saw a baby, a baby
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; wrapped in swaddling cloth.
[2:04:56] Jehovah
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; wrapped
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; the the the one who created
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; the heaven and earth
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; is now on earth
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; condescending to the lowest spot to be a
[2:05:12] baby
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; they were those people of the religious
[2:05:18] men of the day
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; were were entangled into tradition
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; but yet the word was being born.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Is it not what is going on? We have a
[2:05:32] lot of denomination,
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; but yet in the humble way,
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; God was to Kentucky
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; to Jeffersonville
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; to have a little baby being born there,
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; a messenger
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; for this age
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; in the most simplest way.
[2:05:51] where Luke chapter 17 has to be
[2:05:54] fulfilled in our days where God himself
[2:05:56] comes down
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; allow amen sanctify a man and tell him
[2:06:01] don't drink don't smoke
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; don't defile your body
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; because I need to use that body for a
[2:06:06] purpose
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; he will make himself available
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; that God will use him
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; he says just to let you guys know this
[2:06:17] is not me I'm just your brother
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; he says I'll prove it to you by turning
[2:06:22] my back. He turned his back. He says,
[2:06:24] "You sister over there, that's what
[2:06:26] happened to you. This when you are a
[2:06:28] young person, this is where you coming
[2:06:29] from. This is your address."
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; This is not a man doing it.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; This is the promised word being
[2:06:38] fulfilled in your day.
[2:06:42] Amen.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; that was walking that day to the well.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Am I talking something different? I'm
[2:06:51] not talking about the call for body.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; the simple of fire
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; was there talking to this woman.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; You know you had six husband. The five
[2:07:02] husband the one that you have is now
[2:07:04] your husband.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; That same one.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:08] is back again into this generation.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what you've been reading
[2:07:15] in the Bible
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; is being fulfilled in your day.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Benam said the same angel
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; that came over there is here in the
[2:07:27] building.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Then it says greater than Solomon is
[2:07:32] here.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; It did not say that Mechisedc. It says
[2:07:36] this
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Misedc.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Who is this Misedc?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Mechisedc was this.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; It says there is a one, a man that can
[2:07:50] turn on the light.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Saint, we are blessed.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If you love the Lord, can
[2:08:01] you give him a hand?
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Glory be to God.
[2:08:09] He's worthy. He's worthy to be praised.
[2:08:12] He's worthy to be praised. And I'm going
[2:08:15] to conclude with this.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Let's let me look into something here.
[2:08:20] Please.
[2:08:21] Are you bearing with me just for a
[2:08:23] little bit more? Is that okay?
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Please forgive me.
[2:08:27] [Music]
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Please.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Can we go ahead? Can we go ahead?
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Preach it. All right. Thank you. Thank
[2:08:35] you. I appreciate I will not I will not
[2:08:36] take long. Sorry.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; There's something here I need to get to
[2:08:39] get to the airport right now.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Let's look at something here. Luke
[2:08:47] 17:20.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; This one.
[2:08:54] Luke 17:20.
[2:08:59] Luke 17:20. Is that right?
[2:09:03] 17 20.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. And then when it was demanded unto
[2:09:08] the Pharisees when the kingdom of God
[2:09:10] should come. Is that right?
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; He answered them and said the kingdom of
[2:09:15] God. Watch this very carefully.
[2:09:19] S we're getting somewhere.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; When he demanded of the Pharisees when
[2:09:26] that question is when is about the time.
[2:09:28] Is that right?
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; When the kingdom of God should come, he
[2:09:31] answered them. He said, "The kingdom of
[2:09:34] God
[2:09:36] cometh not with observation."
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Let's continue again.
[2:09:44] Neither
[2:09:46] shall they say, "Lord, here, Lord,
[2:09:49] there, behold, the kingdom of God is
[2:09:54] within you."
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; They're looking for a time. God is
[2:10:00] pointing them to a location.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Are we reading together now?
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; They're needing a time.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; But God is pointing them somewhere.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; It says the kingdom of
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; God is within.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. John chapter 14.
[2:10:31] John 14:16.
[2:10:34] I'm going to read the Bible before I go
[2:10:35] a little faster here.
[2:10:38] And I will pray the Father,
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; he shall give you another comforter
[2:10:46] that he may abide
[2:10:48] with you
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; forever.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; That word is used with, right?
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; All right, let's continue. Go down.
[2:10:57] Even the spirit of truth whom the world
[2:11:02] the cosmos
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; the group of people are there
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; cannot receive.
[2:11:08] Not everybody can receive that.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Because it seeth him not
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; neither knoweth him. What? Now catch
[2:11:22] this.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the kingdom. Yes.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Now it's getting into him.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Tell me, brother.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Because it seeth him not, neither
[2:11:34] knoweth him,
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; but ye know him.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, how do I know him?
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; so it must be there for me to know him.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's talking to the disciple. Say,
[2:11:47] you know him. Oh,
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; what are you talking about? You're
[2:11:50] talking about somebody the spirit of
[2:11:52] truth whom the word cannot receive
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; because it seeth not neither knoweth him
[2:11:59] but ye know him.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; For he dwelleth what?
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; With you
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; and shall be
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; in you.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Watch this now. Amen.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; He He is with you because he's still in
[2:12:17] that body
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; called of the men of Galilee.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; But but down there's a promise of the
[2:12:23] company that has come. It's no longer we
[2:12:26] feel it's going to be what in you.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Are we in the scripture?
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Are you in the scripture?
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. 18. I will not
[2:12:37] leave you what comfortless saints. Yes.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; You see,
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; I will come
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; to you. I
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; I will come to you.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Yet a little while.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; The world
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; seeth me no more,
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; but ye see me,
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; because I live,
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; yet shall live also. Yes, I live also.
[2:13:09] Yes.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; At that day, yes, I know that I am
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; in my father,
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; ye
[2:13:21] in me,
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; and I in you.
[2:13:26] [Applause]
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Is that a word?
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; John chapter 7:37.
[2:13:37] In the last day, the great day of the
[2:13:40] feast, Jesus stood Christ says, "If any
[2:13:43] man what thirst, let him come unto me
[2:13:46] and drink." Is that right?
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; He that believe on me as the scripture
[2:13:51] says, "Out of his belly
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; shall flow water
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; of water." 37 But this speak he
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; of the spirit
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; which that the believe on him
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; should receive.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; For the Holy Ghost
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; was not yet given because Jesus was not
[2:14:20] what
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; glorified.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; So Jesus had to be glorified for that
[2:14:26] spirit to go back to the body. Amen.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; So if he's still in flesh, that spirit
[2:14:32] cannot give be given.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; That spirit cannot come. So the only way
[2:14:37] he has to die and be crucified
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; ascend into heaven be glorified.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Then that spirit to return back on
[2:14:48] earth,
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; is he a different Jesus?
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Is he a different Jesus?
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you don't believe it, this is
[2:14:55] another scripture. When Paul was on the
[2:14:57] way to Emmas,
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; he's as he asked him, "Who are you,
[2:15:02] Lord?"
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "I am what?" Jesus.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Was Jesus dead already? Yeah.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; But which Jesus was he of?
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus, but now in many membered
[2:15:17] bodies.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; So once Paul was persecuting the
[2:15:21] Christian, they were persecuting Jesus.
[2:15:25] Amen.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; What make them Jesus? It was the spirit
[2:15:28] of Jesus in them.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; Oh. Then the day of Pentecost.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; As the day was fully come,
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; he has to come to that day, that
[2:15:37] appointed day.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; John 16. Before I go ahead on myself.
[2:15:52] Nevertheless, 167
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; 167
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I tell you the truth.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; It is
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; expedient for you.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Let me stop there.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody's pondering about this.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; It is expedient for you that I go
[2:16:21] away.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; For if I I go not away,
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; the comforter will not come unto you.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; But if I depart,
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; I will send him unto you.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to die
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; to be crucified, be glorified.
[2:16:48] Then
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; back to the church again.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Not the three person of the Trinity.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Excuse me to say that's nonsense.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; The same person, Jesus Christ.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; The God of heaven and earth.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; With Abraham. That was me. That was a
[2:17:09] theophony body.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; But that theophony body mech.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:19] Who is this mech?
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; The resurrected Christ, the resurrected
[2:17:26] word for this day.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart.
[2:17:37] 172. A new earth, a new heaven. So, a
[2:17:40] new heaven and a new earth. For this
[2:17:43] first heaven and the first earth will
[2:17:45] pass away. But in the new heaven and new
[2:17:47] earth, Paul said over here in the book
[2:17:49] of Hebrews, for we receive a kingdom
[2:17:53] that cannot be moved. How did we get
[2:17:56] into that kingdom? Not by a religious
[2:17:59] system,
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; but a kingdom of the kingdom of God is
[2:18:03] what? Within you. You read it.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; The kingdom, watch this. It says the
[2:18:08] king and
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; his word is the same. Amen.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; It's within you.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Just to make sure it's up there.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Vindicating
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; the hour
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; the hour
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; that we are now living
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; the promise that God made for this day,
[2:18:36] this age. Here we are living with the
[2:18:41] king, sitting in heavenly places,
[2:18:45] watching him doing these things.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen?
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Say amen to the way.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:55] [Applause]
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:01] That's why Paul was saying reject not
[2:19:04] him that speaketh now
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; because down there because when he was
[2:19:09] talking about the the shaking and all of
[2:19:11] it that was in the time of Moses
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; because when God spoke the mountain was
[2:19:16] shaking. Is that right?
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; It was thundering and all of these
[2:19:19] things smoke and all of it.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; But when Paul was speaking there was no
[2:19:23] manifestation.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; No thunder but the same voice.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Hebrew 12, we just read it.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; No manifestation, no shaking.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; But the promise word of God
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; was happening.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; So sometime we expect things to happen.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Oh wow. If things does not move, Lord, I
[2:19:48] can't move.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Give me a sign.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; But God is moving. In the time of
[2:19:54] Elijah,
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; he was standing all said God was not
[2:19:58] there.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; But God, it was in a still small voice.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Said you must be able to be sensitive to
[2:20:05] that still small voice.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; It's not loud.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; It's not shaking the mountain, but it's
[2:20:10] a revelation.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; You can be sitting in the room, nobody's
[2:20:13] around. You hear a voice speaking.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; You take heed to that voice.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; And that voice is not wrong. Amen.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; And when you look in the word versus
[2:20:23] that voice that spoke to you, you
[2:20:24] recognize that it's the same person.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Because the one that spoke to your
[2:20:31] heart, saints, let me say this. This is
[2:20:33] an experience.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; You can't take it or reject it. That's
[2:20:36] fine.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; When God deals with you,
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; it must be scriptural.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Not every voice that you hear is of God.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh yeah.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; But if God speaks to your heart
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; one day you randomly just reading the
[2:20:51] scripture you don't even know you're
[2:20:52] reading
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; and you like
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; I never knew
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; what he told me
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; is in the scripture
[2:21:03] [Music]
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; saint when you can connect these things
[2:21:07] like this you know now that you are in a
[2:21:09] good place
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; cuz you're no longer dealing with your
[2:21:12] own ability. This is God ministering to
[2:21:16] your heart now.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; This is not a church now. It's no longer
[2:21:21] just going to church.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Now it's a revelation.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; He can speak to me yet he can minister
[2:21:27] to me in the word.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; The same way that spoke is the same one
[2:21:30] that is speaking the word.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; When brother Benham would say something,
[2:21:33] brother was talking about before he
[2:21:35] leaves,
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; you know, he was mentioning about uh
[2:21:37] Isaiah and all of how Jesus closed the
[2:21:39] book and all whatnot.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; All of this thing had to happen.
[2:21:44] Even himself he did not know but did not
[2:21:47] know
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; but God showed him he says you know
[2:21:49] whatever just happened
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; it is in the scripture
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; is that right
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; it has to happen to you too
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; something's happen in our life you don't
[2:21:59] know
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; but God is speaking to your heart
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; no manifestation what whatsoever but God
[2:22:07] was still speaking
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; to his prophets now let's look at this
[2:22:10] I'm in closing
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; the world is falling falling apart.
[2:22:14] 120 121 I'm I'm coming to a close. Do
[2:22:18] you love the Lord?
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; We have received a kingdom
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; that cannot be moved.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We cannot be shaken in this hour.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; It's saying something. It says we are
[2:22:32] dead. Our life are hidden in in God
[2:22:35] through Christ. And not only that, but
[2:22:39] we are raised with him. Raised up what?
[2:22:42] in the in the system in the denomination
[2:22:45] organization. No,
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; we are resurrected in the kingdom of
[2:22:49] God.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is within. Why this
[2:22:54] you see all these men made system must
[2:22:57] fall.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; All of these things people idea
[2:23:00] denomination oh call me Lutan and this
[2:23:02] he must fall.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; But there's only one thing that will
[2:23:05] remain.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Not once more I will
[2:23:09] shake the world. He's quoting now what
[2:23:11] we just read. But I will shake also I
[2:23:13] will shake heaven. And those things that
[2:23:16] cannot be shown is what will remain.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; And we receive a kingdom. Receiving a
[2:23:22] kingdom that cannot be sold or moved.
[2:23:25] That's the kingdom of God. Not a system,
[2:23:27] not a political will and or no
[2:23:29] denomination, but a kingdom. Let's go to
[2:23:32] the next one. Let's continue.
[2:23:35] Do you believe that?
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:38] We are in a kingdom sitting in heavenly
[2:23:41] places with the eternal king
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; enjoying eternal life by the eternal
[2:23:46] word
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; going to an an eternal heaven forever to
[2:23:51] be with him. Hallelujah. Living in the
[2:23:53] presence of the king. I love him. I'm so
[2:23:55] glad to be one of them. I'm so glad to
[2:23:58] be dead in Christ, alive in the kingdom
[2:24:00] of God. This is not my home. We seeking
[2:24:04] a kingdom. We seeking a king. We seek
[2:24:06] the king. We are already watch what the
[2:24:09] prophet is saying.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; We are already in the kingdom.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; We are seeking the king to come
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; and the king quickly will come to his
[2:24:20] kingdom.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? We receive a kingdom
[2:24:25] that cannot be moved. All these things
[2:24:27] are, you know, all these other things
[2:24:29] are falling apart. America is falling
[2:24:32] apart.
[2:24:34] Europe is falling apart. Asia is falling
[2:24:37] apart. All the world is falling apart.
[2:24:40] But we are in
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; a kingdom, an eternal kingdom. It cannot
[2:24:47] be moved.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; But that kingdom is the Holy Spirit
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; in you. Amen.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit in you
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; is to be born again to die to yourself
[2:25:04] to receive the kingdom.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; And what is the Holy Spirit? Brother
[2:25:09] Benham says something in closing says
[2:25:13] I cannot in the message. What is the
[2:25:15] Holy Spirit? I'm not not going to read
[2:25:17] it. Says you cannot come and receive the
[2:25:19] Holy Ghost unless you know what it is.
[2:25:26] These these things are very important
[2:25:27] saint. We are blessed. When I saying we
[2:25:29] blessed
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; we are blessed.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Watch this element.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; You cannot come and receive the Holy
[2:25:36] Ghost unless you know what it is.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; You cannot receive it if you know
[2:25:46] what it is unless you believe
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; it is given to you.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:25:53] And it is for you.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; You cannot know whether you got it
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; or not.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Unless you know what result
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; it brings.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Then you will know what you've got when
[2:26:10] you get it.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; You want me to repeat it again?
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; You cannot come
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; and receive the Holy Ghost
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; unless you know what it is. Amen.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; You must know what the Holy Ghost is.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; The second thing you have to believe
[2:26:29] that it is given,
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; you know, to you
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; and it is for you.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; Now, you cannot know whether you got it
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; or not.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Unless you know what result it brings
[2:26:45] when you receive it.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; You must know it.
[2:26:50] You know it is to you and for you.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; You know also the result it brings when
[2:26:56] you get it.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; Then you know what you got when you get
[2:27:01] it?
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; Is it simple? Right.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Saints Peter was given the key of the
[2:27:10] kingdom.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; How many of us believe that?
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; You can read it in Matthew chapter 16.
[2:27:15] Amen.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; He was given unto him the key to the
[2:27:20] kingdom.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; And later on the day of Pentecost after
[2:27:25] Peter had received the Holy Ghost is the
[2:27:28] one that had the key. Is that right?
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; And they asked him, "Brethren,
[2:27:33] what must we do to be saved?" Is that
[2:27:35] right?
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; He gave them three elements.
[2:27:39] He said, "Repent every one of you.
[2:27:43] Be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:27:44] Jesus Christ
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; and ye shall receive the baptism, the
[2:27:49] gift of the Holy Ghost. That's act 2:38.
[2:27:55] Simple
[2:27:58] repentance
[2:27:59] there. Some people say, "Oh, I have
[2:28:01] received the Holy Ghost.
[2:28:05] When did you repent?"
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; I don't have to know that, but you know,
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; it's just the principle of the word,
[2:28:10] right?
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I believe I'm going to heaven.
[2:28:13] Oh yeah, all of us. Glory to God. We
[2:28:15] going
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; but we should not deceive oursel.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; We should not deceive ourselves. And I'm
[2:28:25] closing with this. I'm closing
[2:28:26] everything. I feel like this is this is
[2:28:29] the time.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; I feel in my heart the pool. So I feel
[2:28:32] like this is the time. So now
[2:28:36] if you walk in the tabernacle
[2:28:39] uh immen can you can you can you post
[2:28:42] have that picture
[2:28:44] and I watch I want you to catch to catch
[2:28:46] this.
[2:28:49] If a person that does not know God is
[2:28:51] that right is a sinner doing wrong
[2:28:56] because this temple here you know is
[2:28:58] what Moses illustrated in the in the
[2:29:00] wilderness. Is that right? You see that?
[2:29:02] You see that right?
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. A person who does not know God
[2:29:07] because this is the temple and you are
[2:29:08] the temple.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; You touch that. So I'll be going back
[2:29:12] and forth but you can't able you can't
[2:29:13] be able to to digest this. You enter
[2:29:16] here you meet the breast and altar.
[2:29:20] This is a place where they had to kill
[2:29:23] the sacrifice.
[2:29:26] This is a wash called the lav.
[2:29:30] You're washing the the the the the
[2:29:33] high priest and and you know and also
[2:29:36] washing the sacrifice. And you enter,
[2:29:38] you've got the manora which is the
[2:29:39] candlesticks, the showbread,
[2:29:42] the altar of incense. And then down here
[2:29:45] is the altar, right? The ark of the
[2:29:48] covenant right
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; over there. Do you see that?
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; And this place here is where the shagana
[2:29:53] glory comes down.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; After the death of Jesus Christ, this
[2:29:57] curtain is no longer there.
[2:30:00] Praise God.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody catching this, right?
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; This one is is no longer there. In the
[2:30:08] Old Testament, if you do not you cannot
[2:30:11] enter into this area because only the
[2:30:15] high priest had to enter once a year. Is
[2:30:19] that right?
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this right? Amen. Amen.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Any any man that is not qualified to
[2:30:27] enter will die in the Old Testament.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; But now
[2:30:33] not entering into this place is death.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Then
[2:30:40] if you enter you die. For the matter of
[2:30:43] fact they would cher it. You see when
[2:30:46] Adam sinned, it was forbidden unto him
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; to eat the tree of life. There were
[2:30:53] cherbins there. Is that right?
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Nobody had access into God fully because
[2:31:01] even all the prophet when they died,
[2:31:02] they went to paradise. Is that right?
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; They could not really access that place.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; But Jesus had to die. And once he died,
[2:31:11] you remember the veil of the temple went
[2:31:14] from the top to the bottom,
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; which means you have access
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; into that place that was once forbidden.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Nobody this morning can hinder you or
[2:31:26] this afternoon to enter to meet the
[2:31:29] glory.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[2:31:34] You can go in by yourself if you have a
[2:31:37] choice to.
[2:31:40] If you're a sinner, you don't know God.
[2:31:44] You have access here.
[2:31:46] And by the bottom touch this as Calvary,
[2:31:49] you must die to yourself. Accept your
[2:31:51] sacrifice because Jesus Christ is your
[2:31:53] sacrifice.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; If you decide to be baptized, you get
[2:31:57] baptized.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; But don't stop here.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; Your destination is here.
[2:32:06] And most of the time when we enter, oh,
[2:32:09] I came to the altar, gave my life to the
[2:32:10] Lord Jesus Christ. That's it.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Then I'm good. Woo man, I'm safe.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; But that's not your destination.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Your destination is over there.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; You must meet
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; the glory
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; here.
[2:32:26] When you enter, you say, "Oh, I'm
[2:32:28] baptized."
[2:32:30] That's good.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; But let's watch our life.
[2:32:36] Because that snake
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; that is causing us to sin
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; is still there.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; But the venom if you have time study the
[2:32:47] future home. I was about to get into it
[2:32:48] but I I helped myself for a reason. I
[2:32:50] don't know why but anyways
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; so you will understand but the venom is
[2:32:55] saying you entering here inside of your
[2:32:58] heart there is a snake
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; seen the desire to see. He gave an
[2:33:04] illustration of two hearts. Says this
[2:33:06] one has a dove. The other one has a
[2:33:09] snake. When you enter here, you accept
[2:33:12] the Lord Jesus Christ. You be baptized
[2:33:13] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:33:15] That's a good conscience toward God. Is
[2:33:16] that right? Baptism.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; But from here,
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; don't stop here
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; because that snake is not dead yet.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; You can be baptized.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; But you still have the desire to sin.
[2:33:30] Yeah.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; The same thing that you dealt with
[2:33:33] before when you were in the world,
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; they're still coming back.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; You wondering say, "What in the world? I
[2:33:38] thought when I get baptized, all is
[2:33:40] gone."
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; Because once you repent for the sin that
[2:33:44] you have right here, those sins are
[2:33:48] gone.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; It's empty. There's no recordet of it.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; But you still have a walk. If you linger
[2:33:55] here too long,
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; that snake has not died yet.
[2:34:00] You need the fire of this place
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; to burn that snake.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; That snake will make you comfortable to
[2:34:08] come to church.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; You will sing in a choir.
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; You would explore all your gift. You'll
[2:34:17] be a very gifted person.
[2:34:20] That's why brother Benham says when
[2:34:23] Judas
[2:34:25] he operated in miracles.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But when it came to the
[2:34:31] Holy Ghost, he showed his color.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; There is a time there is a principle
[2:34:39] of the harvest.
[2:34:42] Everything that is planted does not show
[2:34:45] its color as it is planted
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; is the fruit that would will actually
[2:34:51] show everything.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; That's why let me say
[2:34:56] I could have entered into this because
[2:34:57] of time. Please forgive me. This is the
[2:35:00] place where we must meet God. There
[2:35:05] the reason why we come into church is
[2:35:07] not just say I'm already baptized. I'm
[2:35:09] already in this church is not enough.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; But instead of us being a blessing, we
[2:35:14] become a stumbling block.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; That snake is stealing having effect on
[2:35:20] our life, how we behave, our answers,
[2:35:23] our reaction and all of it. Because that
[2:35:27] snake is not has not died yet.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; But you need the fire of God
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; to burn that snake
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; so that the do the the the dog
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; can have a place to dwell in.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; Saint you know when
[2:35:42] Jesus this guy came to Jesus and said
[2:35:46] good master no not good masterus
[2:35:49] how you call him Nicodemus.
[2:35:54] He told him something. He says,
[2:35:57] "If you're not born again, you cannot
[2:36:00] see the kingdom of God.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; You would not," In other words, but the
[2:36:03] Bible says, "You cannot understand. You
[2:36:05] would not understand the kingdom of
[2:36:07] God."
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; Show me the quote 11 or 12, please. And
[2:36:11] I'm going to close it. I'm not going to
[2:36:13] read it. I'm just going to pick up
[2:36:15] something. It says, "When you understand
[2:36:18] the belief, Jesus says, except a man is
[2:36:19] born again, you cannot see the kingdom."
[2:36:21] In other words, understand
[2:36:24] the kingdom. The kingdom because the
[2:36:27] kingdom is what
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; you touch there. So you have to
[2:36:32] understand and you only
[2:36:35] understand it is compare what makes you
[2:36:39] do with what the Bible said it would
[2:36:43] make you do.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; You see that? Then your problem is
[2:36:47] solve. See it is the Holy Spirit.
[2:36:52] said in closing, sister can come please.
[2:36:59] We have received a kingdom.
[2:37:02] We must be born into that kingdom
[2:37:07] to not be shaken.
[2:37:10] Are you with me?
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; You say amen to the word.
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot of things happening
[2:37:16] in our life. We having struggles and
[2:37:19] different things.
[2:37:22] Many of us have to come to that place to
[2:37:25] meet God.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; It's not just about coming to church.
[2:37:32] What God recognized that would not be
[2:37:33] shaken
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; is the Holy Spirit, the person of Jesus
[2:37:38] Christ in our heart.
[2:37:42] saints that would make us as the church
[2:37:46] to enter into that place
[2:37:50] to meet God
[2:37:54] because the world is shaking.
[2:37:57] Everything around us, you know, nations
[2:38:00] are breaking. There's a lot of things
[2:38:02] happening.
[2:38:04] Do you agree with me?
[2:38:08] But the word says there's only one
[2:38:11] kingdom that will not move,
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; will not be shaken
[2:38:16] is the Holy Spirit in our heart
[2:38:19] as we standing.
[2:38:21] We can stand please
[2:38:28] s after hearing such a word
[2:38:32] it comes to our heart now
[2:38:37] Lord help me
[2:38:41] every time that I come and when those
[2:38:43] doors are open
[2:38:45] I'm not just coming to make a presence
[2:38:47] here
[2:38:49] I need to mean business
[2:38:52] if these things are not be spoken
[2:38:54] openly.
[2:38:56] We're not actually doing a great job.
[2:39:00] But we have to be prepared, saints.
[2:39:04] Let me put it this way, saints. I feel
[2:39:07] the Holy Spirit pounding in my heart. If
[2:39:10] you have a problem with someone, don't
[2:39:12] leave this place without fixing it.
[2:39:17] Can I repeat that again?
[2:39:20] Today must be maybe your last day.
[2:39:26] If you have a problem with someone
[2:39:30] because as a Christian we must live the
[2:39:33] life of Christ. So if we really got the
[2:39:36] spirit of Christ
[2:39:40] we should not leave this place and
[2:39:42] having a problem with someone.
[2:39:45] We have to make it right.
[2:39:49] The only responsibility that I have is
[2:39:52] to preach.
[2:39:54] I have my own life to worry about. It's
[2:39:58] not just I'm preaching to you myself,
[2:39:59] too. I'm sitting here. I need God's
[2:40:01] grace, too.
[2:40:03] But the word is true. I am guilty, Lord.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; Thy word is true. Have your way.
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; How many of us can really recognize it?
[2:40:14] Say, Lord, I lift my hand. I need you.
[2:40:17] How many of us really need God from the
[2:40:19] bottom of their heart?
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; Look inside of your own life. These
[2:40:24] secrets that are still hiding over there
[2:40:25] that nobody knows about.
[2:40:28] God is speaking directly to you.
[2:40:32] This might be your last day. I don't
[2:40:33] know. I'm not scaring anybody. I'm just
[2:40:35] saying.
[2:40:39] But the church of God has to be ready.
[2:40:45] Shall we pray? Heavenly Father,
[2:40:50] we're coming before you this afternoon.
[2:40:55] You've been so good to us.
[2:40:58] You have helped us so far to leave the
[2:41:00] world and to come.
[2:41:03] Lord, you have helped us.
[2:41:06] We have made a decision to go and to
[2:41:09] come to the altar and confess our sin.
[2:41:12] We've been baptized in the name of the
[2:41:14] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:41:17] And Lord, now
[2:41:19] we need to enter into the holiest of
[2:41:21] holies and to meet
[2:41:24] the pill of fire.

[2:41:29] rather,
[2:41:31] Lord, that anybody that would have a
[2:41:33] desire to receive that Holy Ghost,
[2:41:36] Lord, may you come and confirm and
[2:41:39] vindicate your word in the life of
[2:41:42] anybody that is really desiring for it.
[2:41:47] Lord,
[2:41:49] nations are shaking.
[2:41:53] Bombs are ready to be to be completely
[2:41:56] to annihilate this earth.
[2:41:59] But yet, Lord, there are people that are
[2:42:01] unprepared.
[2:42:03] We are distracted. Oh God,
[2:42:06] but here you have given us your word.
[2:42:09] You have sent us a prophet.
[2:42:12] Lord, if there's any sick in our midst,
[2:42:17] Lord, your word says I send my word and
[2:42:19] my word and heal them.
[2:42:21] May you heal us father Lord of our body,
[2:42:24] our spirit and soul
[2:42:27] from our hurts. Oh God, Father

[2:42:57] somebody tonight

[2:43:07] are also calling us again.

[2:43:12] to the word. Your servant and many
[2:43:14] servants of God has gone through this

[2:43:28] Father, everything are shaking. But are
