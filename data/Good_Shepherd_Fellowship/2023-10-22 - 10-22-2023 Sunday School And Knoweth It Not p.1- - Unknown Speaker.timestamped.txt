[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] [Music]
[0:31] I got into
[0:32] [Music]
[0:33] something uh I want to thank the
[0:38] Lord real well for undertaking for
[0:41] brother caps' boy it um just so happened
[0:45] and this is a little time that I come
[0:48] back to Indiana know they're not
[0:50] recording this I suppose we're not and
[0:52] so then don't see nobody in there so
[0:54] they I come back go squirrel H and so U
[0:59] I guess Charlie's is going to have to
[1:00] put up with me him and Nelly and I'm
[1:01] down in Kentucky now for a day or two to
[1:04] squirrel hunt so uh i' rather miss
[1:08] anything any other kind of recreation
[1:10] than come here on about the middle of
[1:13] August and go squirrel hunting with
[1:14] Charlie Banks and all of them it's kind
[1:17] of a traditional thing with me and so um
[1:21] I took Joel when we was here the other
[1:23] time everybody got sick Chang from that
[1:26] real hot climate down to this to this
[1:29] cool cool climbat you got here I know
[1:31] you think this is not cool but you come
[1:34] out to Arizona once it's 109 the shade
[1:37] when I left the other morning and then
[1:39] around midnight in the night when the
[1:42] cool air come down off the mountain it's
[1:43] still
[1:44] 96 see that's at midnight when the cool
[1:47] air was coming down and so it's that
[1:50] place is all right in the winter time
[1:52] but it's for scorpions and lizards in
[1:54] the summertime not human beings even all
[1:57] the animals take off for the mountains
[1:59] they just can't can't stand it and I'd
[2:02] been out to shoot my little rifle in uh
[2:05] somehow I just want to tell you about
[2:06] the little caps boy and I said and Joel
[2:10] I just have to give him the rifle cuz he
[2:12] cannot shoot me we got it shot in and I
[2:17] I driving tax 50 yards and I said to to
[2:21] Joel Joel said Daddy I believe I can do
[2:23] that poor little fell that had a
[2:24] headache I've been praying for him a
[2:26] high fever he went out the range with me
[2:29] uh any uh 2 over 10 boore and a 22 R
[2:34] flip crosses its line of fire at 25
[2:36] yards is then again at 50 just the same
[2:39] if it's 2 over 10 so then um and I shot
[2:42] it in 25 yards and so I had two more tax
[2:45] and I put of you if Joe didn't drive
[2:48] both them tax I didn't have any more tax
[2:51] so I put a little bit of piece of an old
[2:52] clay pigeon and been bursted there what
[2:55] Trap Shooters shoot at just about a qu
[2:57] of an inch across and tuck it out on 50
[3:00] yards and he cut it half in Two and the
[3:03] scope was set for my eyes just a few
[3:05] years older than he was so he said you
[3:07] know what I've got to go by and tell
[3:09] Billy to keep off of my feet from now
[3:12] on so I said well I tell you what said
[3:16] let's go down show brother Norman that I
[3:18] said Joe and matches across the world I
[3:22] don't care who it would be nobody now
[3:24] the tax wasn't drove sideways they were
[3:26] drove straight through and that piece
[3:28] not over
[3:30] uh I guess a quar of an inch and a 16th
[3:34] thick and a qu of an inch high he cut it
[3:37] half and two at 50 yards I said there's
[3:41] no one in the world could have made a
[3:43] better shot they a Champions could have
[3:45] done the same thing but you couldn't
[3:46] have made three better shots than them
[3:48] the attack's Not Bent just a straight
[3:50] hole through the paper where the attack
[3:52] went through and uh I said no one could
[3:55] have made a better shot oh I think his
[3:57] headache left him right away and I said
[4:00] well let's go show this to brother
[4:01] Norman which works for the Field and
[4:03] Stream brother Tony str's Sporting Goods
[4:06] place he said um let's go buy Billy
[4:09] first he said I I just want to tell
[4:11] Bubby something and um frankly his
[4:14] brother's never done that
[4:15] good so he said we go by there first and
[4:19] just as I got in the door Billy was
[4:21] stilling his pajamas and he said we went
[4:23] out early because it gets so hot and U
[4:26] so he said um the phone ring and I said
[4:30] uh he kind of looked at me like that I
[4:32] said maybe a sick call it was brother
[4:35] caps for his boy in the operating room
[4:37] then with pontis and that pending and uh
[4:42] just now he told me his boy's recovering
[4:44] real real good so see how God just
[4:46] worked out even the voice of that little
[4:49] boy Joe instead of going down to brother
[4:50] Norman wouldn't have been there and come
[4:52] up and brother capside joined together I
[4:55] don't say it was our prayers that done
[4:56] it but it did mean something to him for
[4:59] us to make contact like that and frankly
[5:02] that's what when you got you got to have
[5:06] faith in what you're doing see and that
[5:08] his faith the call and Billy was is
[5:11] putting in money he said this must be a
[5:12] real long distance says he putting in PR
[5:15] $5 for the change in a three for a three
[5:17] minute call and I thought it' be coming
[5:19] from New York or out in one of the
[5:21] islands or something but he made a
[5:22] person to person called to get Billy
[5:24] instead of blow you see and that's what
[5:27] it cost him to do that and now his boy
[5:30] is recovering brother cap said the
[5:32] doctor giv him very little hope of ever
[5:33] coming out of it you see from the
[5:35] operation and we're thankful to God this
[5:37] morning amen very glad for it now we got
[5:42] in towards daylight this morning and uh
[5:45] I had about 3 hours sleep and and I'm
[5:49] pretty tired but when the church come
[5:51] time to come to church well I I come
[5:53] down and
[5:55] uh uh the Lord willing now I've got to
[5:58] go down and Kentucky and said then I've
[6:01] got promise to speak one Sunday while I
[6:04] was back here and I better make it this
[6:05] next Sunday because the following I'll

[6:16] morning and um brother Neville said why
[6:20] don't you just go out and greet the
[6:22] people and talk to him just a few
[6:23] minutes I said brother Neville I haven't
[6:25] even opened my Bible already I said uh
[6:28] he said well go out and say something to
[6:30] him and sister Neville I I I don't know
[6:34] how you do
[6:35] it um he's a very persuasive
[6:39] fell but while I don't get a chance to
[6:42] say this when the place is all packed
[6:44] and crowded and everything but I'm very
[6:46] grateful to God for a pastor like
[6:49] brother Armen
[6:51] neille faithful just as faithful as he
[6:54] can be to the cause and never hear him
[6:57] grumbling I sat back there I had a good
[7:00] half hours talk with him while I was
[7:01] enjoying brother man and uh so I'll tell
[7:05] you more about that when we get Colorado
[7:07] this year so when we was U enjoying this
[7:10] message and uh I got a good talk with
[7:12] brother Neville I said I don't even get
[7:14] to tell the people nothing about our
[7:15] fine Pastor I said are the people
[7:18] treating you right said it couldn't be
[7:20] any better and I said well that's what
[7:22] I'm glad to hear when a pastor's
[7:24] satisfied and the people's
[7:26] satisfied it makes a real good good
[7:30] church and then God is satisfied and I
[7:33] think to see him satisfied together
[7:36] especially in this day of the message
[7:38] that we're carrying I think that shows
[7:40] the continuity of the message with the
[7:43] people and with God see and I'm very
[7:46] grateful for brother Arman Neville and
[7:48] his fine wife and family and I pray that
[7:52] God will keep them loyal to him and the
[7:55] cause and if it so please him may we be

[13:58] love of
[14:00] Christ and now let us read from
[14:04] Revelations the third chapter just a
[14:07] portion to say that we read the Bible
[14:09] because what I'd say might fail but what
[14:12] he says won't fail and I don't know
[14:15] where to start from what to do where to
[14:17] go but I'm just reading the lady to see
[14:19] a church age unto the angel of the
[14:22] Church of Lady of sin write these things
[14:25] sayth the
[14:26] amen the faithful and true witness and
[14:29] the beginning of the creation of God I
[14:33] Know Thy Works th are neither cold or
[14:36] hot I would wor the cold or
[14:41] hot so then because art lukewarm and
[14:44] neither cold or hot I will spew thee out
[14:47] of my mouth because I says I'm rich and
[14:52] increased in goods and have need of
[14:55] nothing and knowest not that th wretched
[14:58] miserable or poor blind
[15:01] naked I counsel of thee to buy me gold
[15:04] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[15:07] rich white reignment that thou mayest be
[15:10] clothed and that thy shame of thy
[15:14] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[15:17] eyes with eyes say that thou mayest see
[15:21] as many as I love I rebuke and
[15:26] chasen be zealous therefore
[15:29] and
[15:30] repent you know somewhere in there as I
[15:34] was reading uh you excuse me a minute I
[15:37] I found some place that sounded good to
[15:41] me and I don't know just where it was at
[15:44] now
[15:46] um here it is and knowest thou
[15:50] not wretched miserable poor blind naked
[15:55] oh
[15:57] my
[16:02] that's kind of the
[16:04] picture here of the
[16:06] church off the
[16:09] day now
[16:12] it's uh I
[16:15] think that that church age here that
[16:19] we're speaking of of course I've got the
[16:20] church age coming forth now in the
[16:24] books but being that is the lady ofm
[16:27] Church age that we're in let's just look
[16:29] at the conditions I don't want to take
[16:32] any text or anything because we're not
[16:35] just
[16:36] talking casually as we'd see to talk on
[16:40] whatever the Lord would lead us to do
[16:42] but something that would help us let's
[16:44] think of the lady Sea church age and its
[16:48] conditioned
[16:49] today as far as I know I don't see
[16:53] anything to
[16:54] hinder that this
[16:57] time of uh the coming of the Lord Jesus
[17:01] outside of the Readiness of his
[17:04] church I think that one of the the
[17:08] prophecies yesterday coming up in the
[17:10] car we drove it in two days from Tucson
[17:13] here right 2,000
[17:16] miles the billion I and
[17:19] so we um now that wasn't breaking any
[17:23] speed laws we stated right I sat there
[17:25] if he's driving I'm all all got my
[17:28] fist back like a shotgun with a hammer
[17:31] back I see him G I said wait a minute
[17:33] boy uh we are told give Caesar watch
[17:36] Caesars then we come in down here last
[17:39] night a little girl in sprawled across
[17:41] the road about 3 years old mother dead
[17:44] over in a
[17:45] ditch some drunken boy coming from the
[17:48] RC's 18 years old driving 120 mph on the
[17:51] left hand side of the road killed and I
[17:54] guess he was dying too then you're going
[17:56] to realize what it is give season c
[17:58] Watch Caesars innocent people dying a
[18:01] little three-year-old girl lost her life
[18:04] because of some drunken
[18:06] Soldier uh driving 120 mph estimated on
[18:11] the wrong side of the road coming up
[18:14] over the hill shot right down killed him
[18:16] all right there together I he was dying
[18:18] too so and you can see even though the
[18:21] innocent party was doing now that boy is
[18:25] guilty of coldblooded murder
[18:29] I think if a man would be caught on the
[18:30] road drinking he ought to be given 10
[18:33] years flat for a premature premeditated
[18:37] murder any man because it just any man
[18:41] we we'll never do any good with politics
[18:44] it's rotten God's idea of having a king
[18:48] a righteous King is right the politics
[18:50] just simply spread out you can buy
[18:53] anything out cheat Li steel everything
[18:55] else as I said a few Sundays ago and
[18:58] look look where you're
[18:59] at nothing but just a crooked massive
[19:03] everything but a righteous King can make
[19:05] his own
[19:06] laws and you can kill a man there no
[19:10] good politics that's all right you get
[19:12] out of it see and so it's it it the
[19:16] democracy is a good idea but it won't
[19:20] work you're like
[19:21] communism all things in common it sounds
[19:25] good but it won't work no the God's of
[19:28] having a king like David was was right
[19:31] and you got one mind centered over like
[19:34] one leader and a bunch of geers so forth
[19:36] you can't take two or three of them then
[19:37] you mess them all together you come up
[19:39] with any kind of an idea so we find the
[19:44] conditions
[19:45] today ready for the coming of the Lord
[19:50] but while brother Neville and I and
[19:53] these other brothers are trying to
[19:55] Shepherd a
[19:57] flock I've got something on my mind now
[19:59] that comes that we might talk
[20:01] about that
[20:03] is I got a letter the other day from a
[20:07] fine
[20:08] lady I never got it come through another
[20:11] person and she was
[20:14] certainly tearing me to pieces or trying
[20:17] to was saying did you ever can't you
[20:21] Christian businessman do something to
[20:23] stop brother
[20:24] brand said because that he's got this
[20:26] book out now called the lady see a
[20:28] church age bringing out
[20:31] more and said he's just simply
[20:35] tearing Pentecostal Doctrine to Pieces
[20:38] said now he's talking about the initial
[20:40] evidence ain't speaking in tongues and
[20:43] said then he's again swimming preachers
[20:44] and this was a woman preacher and her
[20:47] boys some of the best friends that I got
[20:50] in the world she they're among the best
[20:52] friends that I
[20:53] got and she said now and this man and
[20:57] wife is eating bread breakfast with him
[20:58] they said brother Bram look at this
[20:59] would you think it and pulled out a
[21:01] letter I said well sister she just don't
[21:06] understand the boys told me their mother
[21:08] was a woman preacher and and she didn't
[21:11] go for the message and now she says in
[21:15] here she said now he said women should
[21:18] not have authority over man said how
[21:22] about BBE in the
[21:26] Bible Paul's help her
[21:30] certainly she was a seller of
[21:32] goods and uh Paul asked the people you
[21:36] think Paul would say let the women keep
[21:38] silent in the churches not permitted
[21:40] them to speak and turn around and say
[21:41] now fee be my helper in the gospel you
[21:44] should go to preaching a few nights well
[21:46] he' contradict his own
[21:49] word and said then top of all I believe
[21:53] it was Esther was one of the judges in
[21:55] the Bible said a woman was a judge in
[21:58] the Bible if that's not authority over
[22:00] man and this businessman that was healed
[22:04] right here in the church not long ago he
[22:05] said now his wife said brother BR that
[22:08] always puzzled me I said well sister how
[22:11] would that puzzle you said well here is
[22:15] the woman judge I said that's politics
[22:19] not the church am I don't have nothing
[22:21] to do with the church Paul said let him
[22:23] be under obedience as also sayth the
[22:26] law and the law can't put a woman up to
[22:29] be a priest can't put it up you never
[22:32] seen a woman high priest you never seen
[22:34] a woman a priest nowhere in the Bible
[22:37] you never seen a woman a preacher in the
[22:38] Bible certainly some of them was
[22:41] propheus and so forth marry him and
[22:44] different ones and Esther one of them
[22:46] was a judge over Israel sometimes they
[22:48] were Queens over them and so forth like
[22:51] that king and queen the decease of the
[22:53] king the queen had to take his place to
[22:54] the elect of another king and so forth
[22:57] and two in Tucson Arizona we got a woman
[23:00] judge there in the city that's reason
[23:02] the city is so polluted and we got a
[23:05] woman ain't got no business in politics
[23:08] she got no business in the O over any
[23:11] Authority in the
[23:12] church her place is a man's Queen at
[23:16] home outside of that she has
[23:19] nothing and we know that to be the truth
[23:23] you will never find I know that sounds
[23:25] oldfashioned but I'm responsible
[23:28] and I know that after my going away from
[23:30] this Earth them tapes and them books
[23:33] will be living on and many of you young
[23:34] children will find in the days to come
[23:36] this is exactly the truth because I
[23:40] speak it in the name of the
[23:43] Lord now we wonder how a
[23:46] woman that's a good woman and she is
[23:49] brought on this Earth by her loyal
[23:52] husband a good
[23:55] man some of the finest boys that I I
[23:57] ever met their
[23:59] man uh I've ever met and just quickly
[24:03] just as soon as they heard the message
[24:05] they were sold on it
[24:08] 100% now that can only come by for
[24:12] ordination the only way it can come now
[24:16] the question is here I thinking that see
[24:19] now why the Lord was bring me back a
[24:20] know it no know it not th naked
[24:24] miserable wretched blind and know it not
[24:27] before I get to that spot I might brief
[24:30] what I said a few days ago here in a
[24:33] message on I believe it was the uh God
[24:37] of this world blinded the eyes of the
[24:40] people that they
[24:43] absolutely worship the
[24:45] devil in religious
[24:48] Services did you all get that all of you
[24:50] understood it and then in that same
[24:52] message I brought the subject that a
[24:55] woman wearing
[24:58] immoral clothes
[25:00] indecently she is be judged at the
[25:04] Judgment bar as a street prostitute that
[25:08] sounds awful strange let me draw you a
[25:11] little
[25:12] picture now here is an attorney in the
[25:16] city a young fellow and he's a nice man
[25:20] as far as as politically I imagine he
[25:23] may be decent in his politics and then
[25:27] um he goes with a girl that's very
[25:29] popular they fall in love and Mary they
[25:32] attend to all the parties and the great
[25:36] uh things and they all drink together
[25:39] finally she uh he has a nice home he
[25:42] lives in a nice neighborhood he's a well
[25:45] thought of amongst the people but he
[25:48] both of them drink she wears shorts cuts
[25:52] her hair wears makeup everything just as
[25:57] sexy as beautiful woman displaying
[26:00] herself well she never goes to church at
[26:02] all neither one of them so moving next
[26:06] door to him comes a woman from the
[26:09] Baptist Church or the Methodist Church

[26:13] husband now this woman uh let's make it
