The Lord bless you. Lord bless you. And uh thank you musicians. Let's uh let's go directly to the word and uh it looks like uh uh many times we get in so much horish to preach the word. We get so much to say to you and then uh we we take less time to be able to worship and appreciate the one the reason why we are here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. uh a lot of our pulpit have turned over to be a place where we we just come and give you a lot of information you know uh if there is one thing that we have in this message is information &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; over 11,000 tips we have a bunch of information to give to you and uh uh praise the lord so let's let's stand on our feet this morning we trust that the Holy Spirit will will will minister to us amen we will enter in with him. We will worship with him and uh uh is is completely different. And if if uh if a person is not a good preacher like me, you really need God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to create a lot of my atmosphere. Let the people might be in heaven. That's the only way. The little thing you will say will be a blessing. If not, you will struggle and I struggle all the time. So the Lord bless you. Acts chapter 13. Acts chapter 13. Let's take Acts chapter 13. Praise the Lord. Let's take Acts chapter 13 for the reading of the scripture this morning. And uh last week we started our year uh speaking on sparring partners. We want to continue there in this morning because I feel that's what the rapture needs. The rapture needs spiring partners. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will go in the rapture. We need to be spiring partners. We need to we need to find our place in this work of redemption. That's what we are called for. We're not called to be church members just to be bench warmers. We are called to be partners with the redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So we want to continue in our our talks uh uh this morning and just uh uh trust that the Lord will put his blessing on the reading of the word. Acts chapter 13, let's read this morning. Now there were in the church that was in Antioch setting prophets and teachers. Setting prophets and teachers. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. as Barnabas and uh Simon that was called Najger. Now I will grab your mind on that and just tell you that that was the Simon that helped Jesus to to the cross. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the Simon that helped Jesus, you know, to to carry the cross. And the reason why I made that comment this morning is because brother Brandham got so he got so uh uh attracted. He he he used that as a cher whenever he was praying for uh a black child. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He always used that as a china. He saw it as a cher and he would say Lord remember that day on the road of Calvary, &gt;&gt; right? one of her one of her ancestors help you see her need and minister to her. And and and and the next thing there is that it is just to show that just that little moment for the Roman soldier pulling him out of the crowd. He was not a disciple. The Roman soldier just grabbed him out of the crowd, pull him down and said, "Help this man carry the cross." That little moment from wherever he took the cross to Calvary changed his life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It changed his life &gt;&gt; and now he's part of the church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the things that are done for God that last. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Simon that was called Naj Lucers of Serene and uh many which had been brought up with Heron the Tetras and Saul that's the apostle Paul the least among the brelings his name here is the least as the minister to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where unto I have called them. &gt;&gt; And when they have fasted and prayed, they lay their hands on them and they send them away. &gt;&gt; They send them as sparring partners. Yes. The Holy Ghost calling men to be partners in the ministry. men of two different background of two complete different background the Holy Ghost calling them to be partners in the work of redemption. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we want to thank you. We want to appreciate you Lord God and uh thank you for the word that we have read this morning. And we just pray that Lord you take complete control in Jesus precious name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. And uh and we would say uh let our let our little ones uh the ones uh the Sunday school ones you go back there with uh sister Naisha. She will spend few minutes with you and then I'll send you back to your parents. I almost forget. Praise the Lord. And then I will I will break I will break it and then I will regret again. Amen. Praise the Lord. So you have to help me to to remember those things. And uh I believe that uh uh every every service we will have one or two that uh our sisters can be able to to work with that day. just so we encourage them and then uh praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you Are we ready for the word this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. You feel that uh uh your spiritual appetite is all over the place. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but we just pray that God will will just give us uh a special blessing this morning. So uh we will do a little little little uh history work here in laying a foundation as we talk about these two men Paul and Barnabas and uh we know that uh Barnabas he was not uh he was not part of the disciples. He was not part of the 12. Neither Paul was. And here we see the Holy Ghost is calling him out in a very special way. This is by prophecy. Someone standing up right in the middle of the church and prophesying and says uh separate me Paul and Bar thou said the Lord for the work of the ministry. Praise the Lord. Amen. So when we look when we look u I did I did a kind of a study during the week on this and I don't know where I left my notes. I don't know where I left my notes. Maybe I left you on my table in the in the homes. But I'll be able to cap on it this morning because there were references that I put so I can be able to go fast with you, but I won't be able to like uh uh I'm supposed to. So, we will just take our time. Amen. Praise the Lord. We will take our time. So, Barnabas, according to scripture, Barnabas was a Levi. According to scripture, he was a Levite. You see that in Acts 4:36. If you want to write that, write that down. Barnabas was a Levite. And uh uh and then also uh uh uh Barnabas was uh was uh let let me say it this way. He was a businessman in some way. He was a wealthy man. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was a wealthy man. And uh uh uh because uh uh when you look a little bit into there and you see where he was, he lived somewhere then in Cyprus, you know. Uh uh uh and and uh but uh this uh Barnabas uh uh somehow he came to faith. We can really don't have a a record how he came to fight. uh uh maybe he was among the thousands that believed the day that Peter preached. But Barnabas came to faith being a Levite, being a man that is very observant in the Lord. Uh yes, he came to faith and uh and and then we realize that uh uh uh Barnabas, you know, is he's one of those men. He's almost like uh uh our brother Joseph that that borrow his grave to Jesus, you know. uh uh he was a man of uh of a very high status in so much that he can go over to uh to the governor and request the body of Jesus. You know, so the the the gospel have a way of of attracting these people. Amen. The gospel have a way of reaching out into every class, &gt;&gt; every class, every social gathering. Praise the Lord. And uh uh for the many long time we people have bear the mind that the gospel is only for sicks suffering people and sometimes that's the way the elite sees it you know that you know I mean they have prospered in their business and and their way of life and and they don't need anything to pray to God for anything. It's only people you know uh uh that are so much in need. But if you read the Bible, you will realize that the scripture has reached every level of society. Every level. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Every level of society. Look at man like Kolenus. Kolenus was not just a person. He was not just he was he this guy was a leader. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was a leader. You you look at man like Paul who talk about him and and Galia and and even Nicodemus. You talk about Nicodemus, you're talking about a student of uh of the scripture. So we see here that the Bible I mean the word henas came to faith and I believe that God brought him at a particular time and for a particular mission and that's what we will realize here uh as we look into it. So you will see there in in acts chapter 4 it talks about bann that's where he he's uh he was first mentioned and then it is not too long when the bible will get right into acts chapter 5 where ananas and so far's uh condition will come out and you will see that if you read carefully you will realize that uh uh uh they became a little bit uh what I say uh uh jealous or try to get into that competition because if you read the Bible, the Bible would tell you that uh uh Banner was among those that sold some of his land and gave to the church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He sold some of his land and then he gave to the church to support it. Now in a way that uh uh uh many times these things has been has been looked at at at a place where the Bible say they sold everything they have and lay them at the apostles feet. The Catholic Church used that over the years. And it would be wrong for us to think that that that was what the word of God was saying. No, that was not what the word of God was saying. that the people should rob themsel of everything they have and make the preacher rich. No, that was not what they did. That was not communism uh anyway. No, that that was not what they did. Uh uh because if now Peter wouldn't have asked Ananas, nobody forced you to do this. The land was yours, the money was yours, you were only asked to give what you can &gt;&gt; and not not create an impression. Don't lie to us &gt;&gt; because nobody force you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what Paul was dealing with. Paul was dealing with h a lying spirit, a man trying to create impression. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh and so you will see that's that's what it comes. But but the reason why is that not too long the church in Jerusalem will get under pressure. They will they will get under persecution and they will need support. So Bernabas will be one of the men that will take the mission of gathering support for the church in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Banabas will be one of the man that would take uh uh uh uh this responsibility. He would get under this burden and and and then he will start gathering uh uh uh to to go and and help the church. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in doing this, in doing this uh uh uh trying to help and and and getting getting himself involved in in in the move, getting himself involved in what we would call the message of the hour. In in those days, they never call it the message of the hour. The way they call it was the way. &gt;&gt; That was how they call it. You look through the through the through the New Testament or through the book of Acts, they call it the way. That's why Paul says the way that is called heresy &gt;&gt; that is the way &gt;&gt; we choose to worship the God of our father. So the way was what what like why we call today the message of the hour they call it the way. Praise the Lord. And uh uh uh so uh it was in this traveling around that Barnabas came across Paul who was Saul at the time. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when uh when and uh when when uh uh uh Paul met the pillar of fire on the road of Damascus uh uh and and the Lord kind of for there with him, he stayed there for a while. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He stayed there. He got baptized for a while. and uh and and right there right there where God met him, that was where he started giving his testimony. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So he would go to the synagogues, the very synagogues where the people knew him to be the one that had the authority to go and arrest the believers. He went back to that very synagogues to tell the people that what I was fighting against is greater than me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you will go into the synagogues and and and and the teachers will BE ASTONISHED. I THOUGHT IT WAS THIS MAN LAST WEEK THAT WAS blasting against the Christians. What's what's what's wrong with this guy? &gt;&gt; But you know, he will first start to tell them and explain how, you know, this day he was on his way to travel and uh and and there was a light. He says, "Man, he see I'm imagining him saying that uh uh uh you know, we we heard that the pillar of fire follow our our fathers uh uh by night and it became the pillar of cloud by day." I want to tell you that that same pillar of fire is here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And everybody sitting down in the in the in the synagogue say, "What is he talking about pillar of fire?" And it's only Moses that talk about a pillar of fire. You say, I'm telling you that same pillow of fire is here. &gt;&gt; You you people are looking at me as if you don't believe it, BUT I'M TELLING YOU THAT SAME PILLOW OF FIRE IS HERE BECAUSE THAT PILLOW OF FIRE MET ME ON THE road of Damascus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see, when a man is preaching out of con out of conviction and he's preaching h something that is real to him, you don't preach to convince people. &gt;&gt; You preach to testify what you believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; And leave it to God whether they will get convinced or not. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he goes and then uh uh uh he says AND AND THAT PILLAR OF FIRE THAT MET ME on the road of Damascus. A voice came out of there. &gt;&gt; I KNEW IT WAS THE SAME LIGHT THAT LED our fathers. And I said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; and that light &gt;&gt; said, I'm Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, if if you ever if you ever watch any of the Pharisees, heresy, heresy, heresy, stop that heresy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This is heresy. STOP THAT HERESY. STOP THAT BLASPHEMY IN THE TEMPLE. &gt;&gt; But Paul didn't care. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He didn't care. He knew that he lost his sight. &gt;&gt; He knew that he fell off of the hearse. Amen. &gt;&gt; Down to the ground. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He knew that he was led as a blind man to go and meet Ananas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This was not a dream. &gt;&gt; This was a reality. This was something THAT HAS AFFECTED HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And it has affected his life for good. And I believe it was one of those time Benas being a Levite, he would stop around and see Paul &gt;&gt; right on the temple porch testifying. And Barnabas might have observed him over and OVER AND SEE WHAT WHAT A convincing message he had. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW REMEMBER ALL ALL THE ALL the the the the Christians at that time they were afraid of this man. &gt;&gt; So he he WAS NOT JUST PART OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. NO THEY they just you know yeah you know Ananas pray for him he received his side. Ananas baptizing Ananiah well that is your that's your disciple. You take it on him for now. Make sure that man is completely delivered. Maybe he's on a disguise. Maybe the the the the Sanhedrin council has sent him. He want to try to to to find our hiding places, you know. So, so Paul, he was somehow left to himself. &gt;&gt; And you read the scripture, you know, Ananas said, "Lord, you know what that man has been doing to the Christian church &gt;&gt; and you telling me I should go to him to go and pray for him?" He said, "Come," he said, wake up in the morning, call his wife and said, and said, "Honey, y'all pray for me. If I don't come back again, I'll see you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I woke up this morning and I I got a I got a word from the Lord. He's sending me down there to go and pray for Saul. You said who? Saul that you sure you were not I mean you're not losing your mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as hard it was for the believers to accept that man, that is just as hard it is for us when we know too much about people for us to be able to receive from them. &gt;&gt; Human nature has never changed. The more we get closer to the Lord, the more people get more critical. And sometimes they are being critical destroy their faith because they can't be able to receive from God. And that's why brother Brandon was saying that is the greatest thing. That is the greatest thing for one mortal to believe in another. &gt;&gt; But I would tell you that is the mystery of godliness. &gt;&gt; For God was manifested in flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the mystery of godliness &gt;&gt; is for you to be able to look beyond a man flesh, beyond his failure and still see God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Angels who have never preached this gospel because as you are sitting there when the angels see you sleeping he just blind you and you stay sleeping. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God had to use men. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now so saw Saul. He he he he saw Saul. how you saw s. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible would tell us that uh uh uh in chapter 11. Band is gathering uh support for the church in Jerusalem. It is just at that time that uh Barnabas will will meet uh Saul and then he will he he will call him. He get a hold of him and call him. That's when he will meet Saul. The Bible says he will go and meet him. And then uh uh uh Acts chapter 11. Acts chapter 11. Acts chapter 11. Now this is state around Antioch. Read from verse 21 quickly. I've not got to my message. I'm just I'm just trying to to do some Bible studies with you. And the hand of the Lord was with them. And a great number believed and turned unto the Lord. Then tidings of things of these things came onto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem. And they sent Barnabas that he should go he should go far go far as far as Antioch. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who when he came and have seen the grace of God was glad and exalted them or that was uh uh that with purpose in their heart they should cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good man in full of the Holy Ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the Lord. then departed Barnabas to Tashus to seek Saul. He wanted to find this man that he have seen testifying in the temple. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then he went to seek Saul. He went down to Tashas because when Saul he stayed there for a while and when the people were not you know he was not associating with the believers so he had to go down to his hometown Tash saw of Tashas that's that's where he was from so he went back to his hometown and uh uh uh and and and you will you will also realize that uh uh before he did that there should be couple of years now, not just month because I call into history why he was there. Uh uh that was when he went at the backside of the descent and spent uh uh three years reconciling the Old Testament with this new move of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now realize that he had never met none of the disciples. &gt;&gt; He had not met Peter. He had not met James. He have not met John. But he has met the writer of the book. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he came back from the from the from the desert of Arabia, his testimony was just as same as what Peter had. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now he's back. He's gone back to his hometown. He's just in his village doing his own thing, you know, doing his own thing. He's pondering this thing. He's reconciling. He's reconciling in his mind. and the experience that he have had at the back side of the desert. He's reconciling with with everything that he have heard what they have said about Jesus and and and uh and and I believe that Paul in his mind he's in some sense he's having a regret. He's having a regret IN HIS MIND. OH, I WISH I met him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wish I met him. I can remember I was I WAS I WAS JUST THERE. uh on the road OF JERICHO, I HEARD A NOISE AND they said he was coming. HE WAS GOING DOWN TO THAT BUSINESSMAN CALLED ZAKIUS'S HOUSE. I WISH I WENT THERE TO THAT MEETING. Now all of these things are flooding in his mind and and and and and he's just in his little corner doing the little thing that he can do for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's just doing the little humble thing he can do for the Lord. He's not looking for attention. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The believers will not accept him &gt;&gt; but he know his experience is truth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; HE KNOW HE KNOW NOT IN THE fullness &gt;&gt; but he know there must be a reason why &gt;&gt; God interrupted my life. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THAT REASON IS, I WILL WAIT until my change comes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So he he pulled back went back to a low life. Now here Barnabas on his mission now going to find this man. I have to find him. Something in Barnabas saying nope. I have never I went to Jerusalem. I hear the people talking. They say sir you know they are saying uh uh uh uh when I was with Jesus on the boat you know and and this other disciple is testify him when he did this turn water into wine and and all of that. But when I stood at the synagogues and hear Paul talking and I heard him ASSOCIATING THAT LIGHT with Jesus AND THEN I REMEMBER JOHN SAID JESUS SAID HE WAS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; There is something about that guy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he went down there. He went there and and then he got him. Are we together? &gt;&gt; And he brought him back to Andrew and he would bring him back to the brethren. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He will bring him to the bridge. and uh and introduce them and introduce Paul to the brethren. Barnabas will be the one that will bring the first church age messenger. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and bring him. He will be the forerunner that will bring Paul and introduce him to the brethrens when they are all ski in their boots. You know, we all have faith and we believe in God and and uh we can speak to our mountains, but when there is just a little pressure comes on us, we come face to face with situation and we start shaking in our boats. They all looking at this man looking at him and all in their mind is this the one that persecute the disciples this is the one that hold the stone you know they are just flooding in their mind and you know and it's sometimes is that's I mean that's the way that we are made that's where our greater battle comes you know can we be able to control our thoughts in those moment &gt;&gt; can we be able to seize our thoughts and say shut up &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so he brought Paul to the disciples and introduce him and allow Paul to tell them his testimony and they are all sitting there. They are all sitting there. They're listening to him and he's saying that morning I went down to the council and I received a letter. I receive another instruction. He never he never shied away from it. He never shied away. He told the disciples, he said, "I have the blood of Stephen on my hands." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's looking at them. &gt;&gt; You think about it. Steven had wife, then he had in-laws, then he had siblings, he had people that were related to him. All there were people in the very church where Stephen was sad sitting in that meeting and the man that that that uh uh uh order the death of Stephen is standing before the church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. See how God sometimes will allow us to confront the toughest thing in our life &gt;&gt; and give us the opportunity. IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE WILL BRING US RIGHT TO OUR CROSS &gt;&gt; and give us the opportunity to say, "Father, &gt;&gt; I forgive them." Amen. &gt;&gt; It's easy to read it, &gt;&gt; but when you are right in the face of someone &gt;&gt; that have hurt you the most, &gt;&gt; can you feel those pains in your mind and in your spirit? &gt;&gt; Are you able to alter those words? &gt;&gt; Amen. Or are you so you are so grounded and you are so wrapped up in your pains that you don't even want to hear their voice say IF IT IS YOU THE EARTH SHOULD open and he's standing right there before those people and he's testifying that morning I still remember those men came and throw their coats to my feet I still remember I was looking right there. I SAW BLOOD SPLASHING OUT OF THE brain of Stevie. I remember when he said, "I saw heaven open AND EVERYTHING THAT THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE SCRIPTURE, EVERYTHING he knew about the scripture, nothing of Stephen death he could connect to the scripture." &gt;&gt; Stephen talking about I see heaven open. NOTHING. NOTHING. BUT PAUL WILL BE THE ONE LATER ON THAT WOULD TELL US WHAT IS THE MYSTERY around heaven open. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BUT STEPHEN SAYING ALL OF THOSE things there is no way he can connect it with the script. You see when people are just so wrapped up and and their spirit and mind is just so attached in religion they can take the very QUOTE OF THE BIBLE, THE VERY COAT OF THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY CAN BE ABLE TO TO CONNECT THE THINGS THAT IS HAPPENING IN THEIR EYES with the scripture. &gt;&gt; Come on now, brother. &gt;&gt; There's no way they can connect it. &gt;&gt; But here they are so filled with their zeal, their self-righteousness is in their mind. to them what they are doing is right. They cannot see with their eyes how they are breaking God's law. &gt;&gt; They cannot SEE WITH THEIR EYES HOW THEY ARE FIGHTING AGAINST THE VERY GOD &gt;&gt; they claim to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There they HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITY. THERE WAS THEIR CALVARY. The very man that killed their deacon is standing BEFORE THEM. THERE WAS THEIR CALVARY. &gt;&gt; Would they say go to hell? Are they are they saying in their spirit? Are they resenting what he say? Or they are saying father forgive him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord have mercy on him. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Help him. Amen. &gt;&gt; But as human remains human, &gt;&gt; hummons are not angels. &gt;&gt; As human remains human, there is always three kinds of believers. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I believe there were some that were saying, "Lord, have mercy on him." And as THEY AS HE'S TALKING, THEY are weeping. They are not crying for Stephen. They are crying and thanking God for what he HAVE DONE THAT HE HAS BROUGHT THIS MAN TO FAITH. And there are some that are sitting there stonefaced. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; STONE FACE WITH CRUESS in their heart. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You just sitting there looking at him with stone face and cruess. You see God don't work on our attitude &gt;&gt; work by his spirit. &gt;&gt; To fulfill his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. I don't know where I got this one from this morning, but &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good. Amen. &gt;&gt; I found a channel here. I'm feeling good. &gt;&gt; If I don't get to my message, I'm feeling good. I will tell you that I'm feeling so good. &gt;&gt; A preacher feels good when the word is ministering to him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there is testifying and he's telling them everything. And then he will come to this place to tell them. And I was on my next mission. I had my men with me AND IT WAS ABOUT NOON DAY. There was a brightness that was in the heavens. I kept looking at it. Every time I b my hair, I'll feel that brightness making a connection with me. &gt;&gt; And I kept looking at it. And I mean it got so bright that I couldn't see anything. I couldn't see anything. And he stopped and all his men came rushing with their their horses and stopped wondering what is happening. But only he could see the light. You see it was so bright that I couldn't see my WORD AND IT AFFECTED ME SO MUCH. STOPPED RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of the road AND AND AND I JUST FELL DOWN BECAUSE MY EYES something that he will have to live with the rest of his life. &gt;&gt; An eyes problem. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MY EYES WAS BURNING ME SO bad that he fed off And he START SAYING, "OH LORD, OH LORD, oh Lord, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; glory be to God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the people were listening. And he says, "You won't believe me, but if you don't believe me, it's telling me the truth." &gt;&gt; There's a voice that came out of that light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It said, "I'm Jesus." &gt;&gt; He says, "I might have not seen him when he walked down the shores of Galilee." &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember I heard news that he was this place and he was that place. I would tell you friends, I never saw this man physically. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But that light said I'm Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you have to remember this. Now all the disciples there in the book of Acts was in uh was in the upper room. It was not every one of them there that that saw the ascension but those that saw the ascension knew that he was taken in a cloud and yet Paul is saying that uh the light said I'm Jesus. The light shone from heaven and blinded him and he says I AM JESUS WHY persecute thou me? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AND DO YOU KNOW MANY OF THE people that even sat in that service that testimony could not could not even reconcile when Paul said why persecute thou me? Because in your mind you didn't persecute Jesus we are the one that you are persecuting. &gt;&gt; So if he was truth if what you saying is true the voice who are saying why are you persecuting the church? &gt;&gt; Come on now. So they start getting critical now because they know quotes. &gt;&gt; They are using THEIR HUMAN MIND NOW TO BE ABLE TO to understand WHAT HE'S SAYING. THE VOICE SAID, "WHY PERSECUTE THOU ME? I'M JESUS." &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE SAYING IN THEIR MIND THEY KNOW IT'S NOT JESUS YOU PERSECUTE. It's the church that you persecute. So if what he was saying is true, THE VOICE WAS SAYING WHY ARE YOU PERSECUTING MY CHURCH? &gt;&gt; Because the people don't understand the revelation &gt;&gt; that THE CHURCH IS THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH IS NOT OUR PERSON OF MAKING IS NOT OUR FAMILY MAKING. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But whether they believe it or not, &gt;&gt; Barnabas knew that God has led him to this man, he knew that he was in the will of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Paul will testify to the church and and and and and and after the service uh h some of the people will build up courage to come and greet him while some will take their children here. Let's go home. &gt;&gt; They are bringing all sorts of people to this church. Let's go home. &gt;&gt; They will pack their children right and jump and and they find their way home. I'm not coming back to this place. Don't tell that man. It's not any time. I'm not coming back. Don't go back to that place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hmon remain humans. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They were men of like passion. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Some people some of the courage and shook his hands and said, "God bless you. &gt;&gt; The Lord God be with you." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you have done if you were in that service. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you have done but I mean you just just examine yourself. If you are sitting in a critical seat, &gt;&gt; you are being critical that day. &gt;&gt; If you're sitting in a resentful seat, you have been resentful that day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the Bible would tell us that on their way from Jerusalem, Barame decided to take his nephew John Mark. &gt;&gt; He took John Mark with him. Now you have to remember now Barnabas is the leader. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Now Barnabas is the leader. He the one went and got uh uh uh Saul from Tashas, brought him to Jerusalem. He's going back. to stop over to his uh his uh his sister place John Mike mother uh where they were having the meeting when Peter came from the prison and uh and and and he took Mike he told took his sister married and says hey let your boy come and go with me he's finished with high school what is he doing well he looking around for job okay let he come and go with me let's let's go let's go we will we find something for him to do at least he can learn and then uh John Mike got into the travel amen &gt;&gt; praise the Lord Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not a good storyteller, &gt;&gt; but I'm just enjoying myself &gt;&gt; this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to bring you into the into the pages of the Bible. &gt;&gt; I'm doing the best that I can. Please enter in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Please enter in. Don't leave out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Please enter in. I'm trying to do the best to bring you right into the pages of the Bible &gt;&gt; because the preaching of the cross is not enough until he can bring us to Calvary. &gt;&gt; It's just a history that we talk about the cross and everything that he done. But if the if the word can bring us to Calvary where right before us, we can see the one that has spilled his blood. We can see the cruelty &gt;&gt; of sin. That is because of my sin. It treated him like that. &gt;&gt; Then the prophet of God will say you will never go back to sin. You never come back to the house of God. But if you just take the word of God as a good lecture, &gt;&gt; you go back home the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So John Ma, I get along with them. He gets on the travel. Praise the Lord. That's in chapter 12. And his year now in chapter 13, they came back to Antioch where the where the church actually begin. There was there was a group of believers in Jerusalem but uh uh the the where the believers were called Christians were in Antioch. They came back to Antioch and uh uh uh that was where finally this great experience would take place. And the Bible will say while they were in service, they had prophets and teachers, which of course these prophets were uh men that had divine gifts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bren would tell they were man of prophets, but they were prophets because they had divine gift to bring thou said the Lord to the people. They would tell the people, "Thou said the Lord, there's going to be a farming in the land." You read that in the book of You read the book of Acts, you see that there. So, they had a divine gift to be able to prophesy and uh and and and bring a word to the people on on setting things. Those were one of those people that tie Paul by the hands, Akabas, and says uh there is something that is waiting for you, you know, and and yet he he will still go to Rome. And uh uh so there in the church while they are having service there the little group there gather in Antioch the Holy Ghost came right in the service and there this prophecy will come out. Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where unto I have called in. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine how Barnabas will have fell in his heart that all of this time he was led by the spirit &gt;&gt; to go after this man's soul. Can you imagine how he he appeared in his heart to know that he was not just looking for somebody that was eloquent? He was not just looking for somebody but he he he he he he was led by God. &gt;&gt; This was God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If now a prophecy IS COMING OUT, SEPARATE ME PAUL and Barnabas &gt;&gt; for the ministry. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're trying to build out here to to our thought of asparing partners. So you see sometimes the people that God has designed to have you walk with in this work of redemption. They are not your childhood friends. They are not your family members. Well, you can just get along. How we all love people we can get along with. And there are some people we just can get along. Amen. and not just people we can get along with. But God has raising people where sometimes we will question their lives. We will question their background. We will struggle with some things about them. &gt;&gt; But in the final end will realize that God ordain it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's almost like the the the the the people we choose to be our spouses. Oh, they know from uh from uh the the the the courtship day. Everything is good. You know, because the real thing of the individual is behind the veil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is behind the veil. Have you gone to those places where they have uh they have uh uh uh uh Spider-Man picture And then it just put a hole there for you to pull your face in. &gt;&gt; And then when you take a picture, you look like Spider-Man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The real person is behind the board &gt;&gt; and they just put their face there. You take the picture, it look like Spider-Man. SO THAT SPIDER-MAN, I CAN BE SPIDER-MAN and and uh uh uh uh uh uh Little GOSS CAN BE SPIDER-MAN. BUT THEN WHEN WE COME FROM BEHIND THAT PICTURE, we are completely different. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When you look at the picture, we look the same. Only the faces are different. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And sometimes that's the way it is. And and you know, and then he's cute. She's cute and they're beautiful and praise the Lord. Then when the layers start coming off, &gt;&gt; when the layers start coming off, oh my god, I can't even stand him. Oh my god. Oh, if I knew, if I knew, if I knew. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me be serious and preach this morning. Can we stand up for the reading of the word? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So just No, no, no, no. Sorry. I'm trying to get out of this thing I'm doing. I don't know how I got here. I'm trying to get out of it. Oh, praise the Lord. BUT WE REALIZE THAT GOD DESIGNED THESE PARTNERS. YOU EVER SEEN THE BIBLE SAYING, "Separate me. separate me and uh uh Barnabas and S. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD THAT IS DOING the calling here. &gt;&gt; Amen. At one time Barnabas might might have think that it was his choice. &gt;&gt; HE MIGHT HAVE THINK THAT I SAW I SEE SOMETHING in this man and I think uh you know he will be the right person to work with. &gt;&gt; BUT FAR BEYOND HIS IMAGINATION, IT WAS GOD'S DESIGN. SO THE PEOPLE THAT GOD PUT IN OUR LIVES is God's design. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that God designed your pastor and he turned out to be like this? &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Oh my God. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know how many times you've been disappointed, but you I mean you you don't have no choice, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You better go to the deacons and start the campaigning for them to for them to call me to bo and vote me out. If not, I'm yet to stay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm here to stay. Well, maybe if if we build you a new church, then we find you a new pastor, then we can go and do whatever we want to do. But for now, if you want to get rid of me, build a new church. I give you the easier way to get rid of me. You want to get rid of me, build a new church. We will find you a new pastor and then I will go ahead and do my thing. But until then, you'll have me to deal with. &gt;&gt; So, the best thing you can do, pray for me. &gt;&gt; The best thing you can do for me, pray for me. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S THAT'S GOD'S DESIGN. Praise the Lord. I mean it has to do with our patterns uh pastor, it have to do with our spouses. It also have to do with uh the prophet of the age. &gt;&gt; God knowing that we will come into an age where now we'll be dealing with artificial intelligence &gt;&gt; and yet HE WILL GIVE US a man for a prophet that don't even have high school education. &gt;&gt; Praise God. WHEN WE HAVE EVERYTHING IN THIS AGE to challenge him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on, brothers. &gt;&gt; But yet, he will give us a man &gt;&gt; in this age. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Because that's God's design. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the the sooner you start embracing it, &gt;&gt; the easier it will be for you. The sooner you start embracing the ones that God has placed in your life, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THE SOONER YOU START EMBRACING it and and and and GET OUT OF THE FANTASY OF YOUR MIND, THERE IS A LIFE. PRETTY SOON YOU WILL START seeing your purpose. Pretty soon YOU WILL SEE WHY GOD PUT YOU IN THE LIFE OF THIS PERSON. HOW YOU CAN HELP THEM AND HOW THEY CAN BE A HELP TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The sooner you do that, the quicker your eyes will start opening &gt;&gt; and you will start living in the new word. &gt;&gt; Or else you will stay in your fantasy. You will regret in your fantasy and you will die in your fantasy because the imagination of man is evil continuously. &gt;&gt; Separate me sword and banners for the work of the ministry. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you will realize that I I I love I I like to look at scriptural things here. And I'm I'm sorry that uh uh you will realize that right in this uh uh uh chapter 13 that's where his name will change from Saul to Paul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Honor a divine commission. Honor a divine commission. His name will change from Saul to Paul. All along the scripture never call him. You know THE THE BIBLE DESIGNED IT THIS way to grab our attention. &gt;&gt; Paul which mean a little man. That's why Paul means a little man. That's why he call himself the least among the disciples. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he's seeing himself here as THE LEAST TO HEAR THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT WALKED WITH JESUS AND SLEPT WITH JESUS. He's looking AT HIMSELF AS the least. I'M COMING AFTER HE HAS GONE MANY YEARS. Praise the Lord. BUT YOU SEE ALSO IN THE HEART OF THIS MAN HE'S CARRYING he's carrying something HE'S CARRYING A BURDEN WITH HIM HE CARRYING SOMETHING BECAUSE GOD HAD THERE WITH HIM SO MUCH AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT THERE IS SO MUCH THING IN HIS mind he's he's he's wondering if if the disciple know these THINGS HE'S WONDERING IF UH THESE THINGS IF HE STARTS TO PREACH them if the people will believe oh I believe that he was a man of slow speech, but yet he was a man that never missed a word. &gt;&gt; When the opportunity was given to him to speak, he never miss a word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His name will change right here in chapter 13. And uh uh as we go on, praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; we will we will find out that you look over in chapter 14, you will see that it was it was Paul and uh Abanabas went down there. I think that was mass hill worthy preach and the people said the gods has come to us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see and and A SENSE THAT GOD WAS BLESSING THESE MEN TOGETHER BECAUSE GOD ORDAINED them to be together. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they heard that the the the the the uh the people call them gods, they tore their clothes. THEY SAID, "NO, WE ARE JUST MEN LIKE YOU. OH, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if I didn't left my note behind long time, I have done I've done a good job with this because I kind of lay this thing out good for me to run through it and then get to what I want to say to you this morning. But let's let's go ahead. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then uh uh uh uh Acts chapter Acts chapter 15 will come the council of the believers. The council the first time one of the first time where Paul will meet with men that walk with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He will meet James. He will meet Peter when he had that council to be able to discuss on how they should deal with gentile believers. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They sent for Paul and Barnabas because more and more report was getting to them that these two men were missionaries and they were doing jobs. They were working among the Gentiles. So they sent for them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I believe Paul sat there with his hands folded, holding his chain and trying to listen to see how Peter and James and these men that were with Jesus, you know, how they taught them the church order, you know, how they will, you know, uh h present things, you know, and and he's sitting down there and just listening to them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; In verse 12, the Bible SAYS, "THEN ALL THE MULTITUDE KEPT silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul." Now, so you see here the scripture keeping it in their order because right now Barnabas is the leader. Barnabas and Paul. It's always Barnabas and Paul. Separate me. Barnabas and Saul because he's the leader. He's the one that God is dealing with. He's the one that God uh h uh you know is is uh uh is inspiring and to bring this man on the scene. &gt;&gt; But the man that God had his eyes on for the age was Paul. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; BUT YET GOD WAS keeping him on a subjuggestion. HE WAS NOT SHOUTING AND SAY YOU WERE NOT THERE AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT. Let me tell you what what what the Lord told me. home. He kept quiet. He wanted to see how these disciple will order themselves. He wanted to see what they would say. Read Acts chapter 15 for for the rest of everything. I'm just I'm just only telling you as much as I know him. And gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracle and wonders God have brought among the Gentiles by them. Banner say they they are testifying. LORD, LET LET US NOT LET LET US NOT CLASS THESE PEOPLE. LET'S NOT CLASS these people as people that can BE REDEEMED. NO, WE SHOULD NOT DO THAT. NO, HE'S SAYING NO, WE SHOULD NOT DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT GOD is working among these people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I would tell you if you if you study the scripture, now we're doing the Bible study this this morning. So that's okay. If we stop here, we'll preach another day. But if you study the scripture, go back to Acts chapter 10, you will REALIZE THAT AFTER PAUL AFTER PETER CAME OUT of the HOUSE OF THE PETER had a testimony. I think he said it here in Acts chapter Acts chapter 15. If uh if I can find it. Let me see if I can find it. Oh my god. I never thought about it. Please forgive me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh uh uh let's look at right here verse 7. and and and and and when there was much being disputed, Peter rose up and said unto them, "Men and brethren, here know how that how that a good while ago God made choice among us that the Gentiles by the mouth by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel AND BELIEVE. AND GOD which knowing the heart bear them witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Paul no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I I I think uh there was something I was looking for. He's not right here. I think it's in the episode of PAUL BECAUSE WHEN PAUL'S I mean in in po in Peter's writing when Paul when Peter SPEAKS OF THE WAY THAT the Gentiles receive the Holy Ghost, he said it in a way, oh my God, I wish I wish I had I found it and and maybe share with you on Wednesday night. He said it in a way that uh the WAY THAT GOD GAVE them the Holy Ghost. I wish that was the way he did to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because he saw it. THEY HAD TO WAIT in the upper room. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD TO PRAY. THEY HAD TO BE IN ONE ACCORD. THEY HAD TO ORDER THEMSELVES. BRETHREN, let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Oh, let's wait. LET'S BUT WHEN HE WALKED DOWN THERE AND TOOK THE WORD, WHY HE PREACHED THE WORD? AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAW IT WAS DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; MEN THAT HAVE NOT been baptized, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. MEN THAT WAS HEARING THE GOSPEL FOR THEIR FIRST TIME, RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST, HONOR THE PREACHING OF the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. IN AN OLD WORLD, PETER WOULD SAYS THAT GOD THREW AWAY OUR CHURCH ORDER OUT OF THE WINDOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN I GOT DOWN THERE, I SAW PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW THEY WERE DRESSED. &gt;&gt; OH, YES. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT ORDER THEY WERE IN, I SAW PEOPLE UNDER THE CONVICTION OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When me being a Jew, I would have nothing to do with a gentile, but I saw the move of God. &gt;&gt; I saw God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Changing the heart of the people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So let us not DESPISE THIS THING THAT WAS THE CLUTCH. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE CLUTCH IN THE CHURCH. CAN YOU IMAGINE RIGHT AFTER Pentecost after these people HAVE RECEIVED THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST? YEAH. THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS. Their attitude to their fellow men because they have taught themselves to be privileged people. They're privileged people. Salvation is of the Jews. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; But Barnabas and uh Saul and Paul declared which mean Barnabas spoke and after he spoke I says I will allow I will allow my friend Paul. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. But I wish I had a tape to listen to his first message. &gt;&gt; I wish I had a tape to be able to just just earrop some of the things he said. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of THE THINGS HE SAID TESTIFYING to these PEOPLE HOW THE GENTILE has believed. HOW THE GENTILE HAS BELIEVED THE GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe Peter, James, and all of these Jude and all of these guys that were WITH THE DISCIPLES SAT down there and just looking at this man. &gt;&gt; BUT I REALIZED THERE WAS SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WITH his message. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE NEVER HAD SERMON BOOKS. He were not with Jesus. THERE IS NO WAY HE COULD SAY, "DO YOU REMEMBER ungodly what he said?" HE DIDN'T KNOW THE THE THE YEAR OF THE TAPES. HE DIDN'T KNOW THE THE NAME OF THE MESSAGE. BUT EVERYTHING he said &gt;&gt; was lined up with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; OH, I BELIEVE ALSO THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT say he's preaching without court. &gt;&gt; He's not reading quotes. &gt;&gt; He was there. He's not reading court. &gt;&gt; Come on now, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's just he's just he's just using his brain. He not you're not you're not using quotes. &gt;&gt; How how can we believe him? He must be quoting the prophet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have all of those quotes here. We misbehave. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; As much as I'm enjoying this, I need to get out. &gt;&gt; Well, how to get out of it? I don't know how. But I'm just trying to show sparring partners. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT WHERE I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS THAT RIGHT AFTER THIS MEETING when this MAN WENT OUT HERE SAID THAT BARNABAS brought his little nephew with HIM AND PAUL FELT THAT THE BOY WAS YOUNG and he was slowing him down. I remember I I CAN THINK IN MY MIND PAUL IS SAYING LOOK BARNABAS THE work of the Lord is not a daycare. It's not a daycare because YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION to this nephew of yours. You are slowing me down. THAT WILL ALSO SHOW US HOW THAT MAN WAS THE MESSENGER OF THE AGE BECAUSE THERE'S A BURDEN HE HAD IN HIS HEART. THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS IN HIS HEART THAT BARNABAS NEVER HAD. EVEN THOUGH AT THE TIME BARNABA WAS THE LEADER, BARNABA WAS THE ONE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO THE APOSTLE. BARNABAS COULD BREAK ON ALL OF THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT BARNABA WAS NOT THE ONE THAT MET HIM ON THE ROAD OF DAMASCUS. BARABA WAS NOT THE ONE THAT MET HIM AT THE BACKSIDE OF ARABIA. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes that's how people are the you know they get beautiful ideas but no burden under the ideas. &gt;&gt; There is no burden under the ideas. &gt;&gt; God gave the burden of the church to one man and that's the pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that in a rough way. I'm trying to say that in a in a knowledgeable way. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because many times people get on they have a burden. They want to see they want to see uh our young people saved. They want to see uh you know uh uh uh all the music better. They want to see things happening. God gave the burden to the pastor and he make us instrument to support that burden. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are all instrument &gt;&gt; to come under that burden &gt;&gt; and support it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you see a person can guess IN A CHINA. OH, LET'S GO BACK TO THE OLD WAY. LET'S GO BACK TO THE OLD OLD TIME DAYS. YOU KNOW, THE OLD REVIVAL. I WOULD TELL YOU there God don't send his people back. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU HEAR YOU HEAR IT IN THE SCRIPTURE WHERE THE BIBLE SAYS UH UH UH UH UH GO BACK TO THE OLD LAND MIKE. YOU know what it means? Remember, remember time pass. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SIMPLE WAY FOR THE BIBLE TO SAYS THE SAME GOD THAT DID IT THEN, HE CAN DO IT NOW. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LET'S GO BACK TO THE WAY WE USED TO DO IT IN AFRICA and then go back to the way we did it in China and go back to the WAY WE'LL GO BACK ON WE'LL GO RIGHT BACK TO THE way it happened in the Garden of Eden where they disbelieved God and all the problems started. God don't go back. He move his people forward. &gt;&gt; The Bible IS ONLY SAYING LOOK BACK AND SEE WHAT GOD DID. HE CAN DO IT IN YOUR TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; There's no no way we can go back to the time of Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; We are living in a complete different age. You cannot bring the time of Noah in our age. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So this IS THE MAN THAT HAD THE BURDEN. HE HAD THE BURDEN FOR THAT GENERATION AND SO MUCH THAT HE WAS SAY I CALL HIM TO MY GOSPEL. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID BASH THIS IS NOT A CHILD CARE THING but and the Bible says there was strong contention. CAN YOU IMAGINE STRONG contention between TWO MEN THAT THE HOLY Ghost says, "Separate me, Paul and Barnabas." &gt;&gt; How do we reconcile that people message people? How do we reconcile that? Are we going to say it was not the Holy Ghost that spoke to them? Then tear that page out of your Bible. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, the scripture say there were just so much a very strong contention between them. Strong contention between them. Now, Barnabas will go with his nephew Mark. And then Paul will pick up Silas. By the way, it starts to travel. It is all in a place that you have to understand men are men are different. They are built different. &gt;&gt; They are bu building different. They approach things different. I would never do things uh the way your pastor used to do it. I'm sorry. Praise the Lord. And uh uh men men are built different and God deals with them in a in a complete different way. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what are we talking about? These men were sparring partners called by the Holy Ghost. THEY WERE NOT JUST THERE TO PAT ONE ANOTHER on the back. No. When there was A GROUND WHERE THEY DISAGREE, they address it by the word. &gt;&gt; It was not a yes man, yesmen, yes man thing. No, we have only one person to be yesmen and that's the God of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to get to this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. THE SAME GOD THAT SHALL SHEPHERATE BE POOR AND BARNABAS. THAT SAME GOD SAW THE PLACE where he saw where that this man AT A SETTING POINT OF TIME, I'M GOING TO DRIVE this man into his ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND YOU REALIZE WHEN PAUL PICK UP SILAS, THAT WAS WHEN HE WENT ABOUT GETTING TIMOTHY AND GETTING TITUS AND HE STARTED RAISING HIS MEN TO BECOME YOUNG PASTORS THAT WOULD TAKE CARE of the church. GOD HAD TO CAUSE THAT SEPARATION FOR PAUL TO FULLY GO INTO HIS MINISTRY. The same thing he did to Urias and Aiah &gt;&gt; or Uzziah and Isaiah. &gt;&gt; UZZIAH WAS THE KING. ISAIAH WAS THE PROPHET. But there was a place OF INFLUENCE AND GOD HAD TO TAKE ONE MAN OUT OF THE SCENE SO ISAIAH CAN FULLY GO INTO HIS MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT JUST A A CONTENTION or a division, you know, where where they can go and start THEIR CHURCH. AND NOW IT JUST LOOK LIKE this church sent bomb to that other church. THAT OTHER CHURCH SENT BOMB TO THAT CHURCH. You heard what they doing there in Brooklyn Center. I heard what they're doing down there in Brooklyn Center. You know what? AND WE USE ALL THE TIME JUST to preach about somebody on the pulpit. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT THE PURPOSE. THE PURPOSE WAS TO ALLOW A MAN TO GO FREELY INTO THE MINISTRY THAT HE WOULD NOT BE JUST UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ONE MAN just hearing it over and over. You know, I brought you to this setting. You know, I brought you here. No, no, no. That was not the purpose. THE PURPOSE THERE WAS TO ALLOW THIS MAN BEING THE MESSENGER OF THE agemen &gt;&gt; for him to be able to express himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know they rejoice my heart. That's why I rejoice in that. you know, if uh if uh uh you know, the grace of God can be able to help you to to to to to raise men and and and allow them go and then you sit back and and you hear, "Oh, yeah, you know, that brother, you know, he's serving the Lord. He's doing a wonderful thing." It rejoice your heart &gt;&gt; than just holding them and holding them. I don't believe in that. I don't believe in that. I don't believe in that. I believe you know that God must be able to help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring new souls to the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To look for new souls if it is just one or two. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I love those houseto house ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I've taken order to time you on this. How could you do that? Think of all of the time on this now. So I'll come to something here. I started with something brother Brandham said in the message there. Uh spoken word is the original seed. Uh I thought I would address it this morning but I I see it's we already 1:00 I've gone over my hour. I don't even know what time I came to the pit. No, it was not 12. Just before 12 I came to the pit. So this all came I preached now an hour and we still believe the message of an hour. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. The message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, brother Brandham shared this thing. Yeah. While we were we were standing last week, I I saw this quote and I knew there was not time for us to get into it. So, I thought I will leave it for today. God covenant with Abraham in his seed. Let's read that. We talking about uh uh uh uh he says now I don't believe that Satan is a creator. I believe that Satan is a perverter but not not a creator because God is the only one who can create and in the beginning when he Satan become a co-partner with God when he became a co-partner this is one of the place that brother Bennon ever used this word referring to the devil as a co-artner. He became a co-artner with God. The son of the morning, that's that's Lucifer. And so forth when he walked up and down the Pharaoh uh brimstones and so forth. That's when Satan perverted good to evil. You know what uh uh what pervert to do to do anything. Okay. Now, so he's he's he's bringing something here that we must look at and we must study realizing that the devil is just a tool in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And if you are a mechanic and you can you can repair vehicles uh uh uh you know and and uh you can repair vehicles, you realize that you have all of the knowledge. But for you to be able to lose those bolts, you need tools in your hands. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So those tools in your hands becomes your co-artner. &gt;&gt; I believe that's what brother Brandon was referring to. Amen. because he's he's about to unfold his plan of redemption. Yeah, he will need a perverter. He will need a man that will pervert good to evil and through that his attribute will be manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see how the devil becomes a co-artner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where he becomes a co-artner. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And you have to realize being a co-artner his role is very temporary. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You being A PARTNER WITH GOD, YOUR ROAD is not temporary. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You use the tools to work on the vehicle. AND YOU SAY, "JOHNNY, GIVE ME THAT h a stroll." And he gave it to you. OH, BRING THE JACK. AND HE BRING THE JACK. AFTER YOU GET THE WORK DONE, YOU PUT ALL OF THOSE TOOLS AWAY. JOHNNY, LET'S GET in the vehicle. Let's go. You don't pack the tools and put the whole mechanic thing in a car. No, YOU LEAVE IT IN A SHOP AND YOU AND JOHNNY CAN TAKE the trip and go wherever you're supposed to go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; SO JOHNNY THAT WAS HELPING YOU TO REPAIR THIS CAR. HIS PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU IS MORE THAN THE TOOLS YOU WERE USING. &gt;&gt; THE TOOLS ARE JUST TEMPORARILY. You need the tools to change the balls AND CHANGE THE TIRES AND ALL of that, but you need this man journey to help you travel on your journey and help you get the work done. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD CALL US INTO PARTNERSHIP, IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN HE GET THE DEVIL AS A CO-ARTNER. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE BEING THE GOD, THE CREATOR, THE FOUNTAIN OF LOVE, he can do evil. SO HE HAS THE DEVIL HAS A co-artner the one that will become the source of all evil. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture? &gt;&gt; Now let's look at another quote another way he express it. There he call sat on a co-artner. Yeah he's going to call him something different in the message Job. THERE ARE SOME PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE JUST TEMPORARILY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVEN AS GOD HAVE US HERE AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE MUST BE PARTNER in the WORK THAT GOD IS trying to achieve in this letter to the assembly. HE BRING US TOGETHER to work in partnership. BUT OUR PARTNERSHIP CAN BE uh temporary in A SIN BECAUSE GOD MIGHT WANT ME TO leave from here and go somewhere and and and and then continue. SO OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH GOD IS INTERNAL. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH ALMIGHTY GOD IS INTERNAL. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And our partnership in the local local assembly can just be for the local assembly. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm just a pastor in this assembly. I get out of this assembly. I'm not a pastor. I'm a brother. I do whatever I'm told to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't go and assert, you know, I'm a pastor. No, no, no. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Job. Redemption is one of the oldest thing in the Bible. Did you know redemption was ever before the plan of redemption was laid out before the word was ever formed? Think of that God for foreseeing and making a way of redemption before he even made the word. Way before the word was made, God had a plan of redemption. And we keep making the emphasis. That's why we are here. That's our purpose in this life. &gt;&gt; The partnership that God has called us to is to that plan of redemption is to find our purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is to find our purpose. That's the REASON WHY EVERYTHING AROUND our life, everything around our life, the better way to be able to understand it, apply redemption to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Apply redemption to it. &gt;&gt; That is the way to be able to see it. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to go to school, apply redemption to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Marriage, whatever it is. You see that over and over in in the scripture. Why would the Bibles talk about if a man have an unbelieving wife and and and and he's comfortable, he can live with her, his faithful is because of redemption. &gt;&gt; That over time redemption could reach her. &gt;&gt; So the believer's purpose in this life is tied to redemption. If you keep that in the back part of your mind and you deal with things in the light of redemption, you'll realize you will always come out right GOD. BUT GOD PUTTING SATAN almost co-equal. The first quote he says co-artner. HERE HE SAYS GOD PUTTING SATAN ALMOST coal equal men almost coequal with him Satan taking the things of God and perverting them into evil thoughts and through there be to pervert things into evil instead of good and God as soon as the first thing was done. The first perversion was done. See what brother Brandham says. Out of his great treasure chest of love, he had a plan of redemption that quick. &gt;&gt; SO EVEN BEFORE EVIL WAS DONE, God already had a plan of redemption &gt;&gt; in his treasure chest of love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Before the first wrong was done. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So we see YEAH HE WAS CALLED EQUAL IN what sense? In what sense? He was called equal. He was brought into this AS A CO-ARTNER IN WHAT SENSE? Because God is good. He's the fountain of all goodness. There is no evil in him. &gt;&gt; So he has to create a creature that will be the source of all evil. He will be the creature, the source of all deception. He will BE THE CREATURE, THE FATHER OF ALL lies &gt;&gt; because God cannot lie. &gt;&gt; So now he get a partner. This work of redemption. I'M GOING TO GET IT DONE. &gt;&gt; I GET THE RIGHT MAN for the job. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the Bible says he was perfect in all his ways. When God made us, we were not perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he made Lucifer, he was perfect &gt;&gt; because he would do his job exactly. HE WAS DESIGNED PERFECT TO NEVER tell the truth. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; OH MY GOD. HE WAS DESIGNED TO NEVER TELL THE TRUTH. EVERY TIME HE OPEN HIS MOUTH, IT'S A LIE. &gt;&gt; YES. EVERY THOUGHT HE GIVES YOU, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU THINK IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST, is a lie. &gt;&gt; From the devil is a lie. &gt;&gt; Because he was designed &gt;&gt; to be the fountain of all lies. &gt;&gt; Wow. Lies, imperfection, perfect lie. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. The Bible says he was created perfect in his ways. He was designed that way. He was designed that way. God needed a man. He needed a man. Out of whom we come all evil. He needed a source. So he created a man. He created a partner, a co-partner. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND ON THIS SIDE, GOD WILL ALSO CREATE A PARTNER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; A MAN THAT WILL BE IN HIS IMAGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ON THIS SIDE, GOD CREATED A PARTNER, A MAN MADE PERFECT IN HIS ways &gt;&gt; to be able to do his job as a tool. He's just a tool. A tool remains a tool. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is just to be used and throw down. That's what a tool is. &gt;&gt; You just use it and you trunk it down. Make sure you don't choke it too far. You might need it again. &gt;&gt; BUT ON THIS TIME WHEN GOD MADE MAN, let us make man in our image and our likeness. AND THE BIBLE SAYS GOD MADE MAN IN his image and in his likeness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you you and the DEVIL DON'T DO THE DEVIL WORK. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL HAVE HIS WORK TO DO. HE'S GOOD AT HIS JOB. YOU HAVE YOUR WORK TO DO. FIND YOUR JOB AND DO IT. &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; DON'T DO THE DEVIL'S JOB. &gt;&gt; HE WILL NEVER FAIL AT HIS JOB. &gt;&gt; HE WILL NEVER. HE'S DESIGNED THAT WAY. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's never in him to repent. It's not in the devil to repent. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's not in him to repent. Why you want to do the devil's job? Why you WANT TO SPEAK THE DEVIL'S LANGUAGE? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Oh sweet Jesus. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the two area of partnership? &gt;&gt; Amen. You get a co-artner here. You get a co-artner almost co-equal but he was designed just as a perverter. He was designed as the source of every negative thing. And then on this side God will get another partner. He will be the source of positivity. He will be the source BY WHICH GOD CAN EXPRESS himself through. &gt;&gt; And that's what God is raising us to this partnership &gt;&gt; to be able to understand our place in redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Grab our purpose. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Here say we born under the sinful nature. And this guy on this side that is the FOUNTAIN OF EVERY NEGATIVE THINGS. He's the prince of the power of the head. We are born under the under his influence. Our spirit man, OUR DESIRE continually streaming on this side for negative things and evil things. But right down here in your soul, &gt;&gt; so silent. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why you will realize the way our body and our mind scream out to you. Your soul don't do that. &gt;&gt; Your soul is very quiet. Your soul is in the silence. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The soul cry out, "Hope thou in God." &gt;&gt; On this OTHER SIDE OF YOU SEE WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT ME. YOU SEE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT ME AND AND YOU YOU DON'T RESPECT ME AND AND all the all of that. The energy here the energy is boiling like the lake of fire. While the energy on this side &gt;&gt; is as rest. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; As the show of glory. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The energy on this side IS JUST AS REST AS QUIET &gt;&gt; AS THE shore of glory. &gt;&gt; You feel the cold breeze. Glory. Oh God. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; When you get on that side, &gt;&gt; you know who I am. You know me. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN COMPARE YOURSELF WITH ME. TOO much energy. IT'S TOO LOUD ON THIS SIDE. &gt;&gt; But on this side, &gt;&gt; say, "Oh God, help me. &gt;&gt; Change my heart. Oh God, I want to be more like you, Father." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the cry that is on this side. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Through partnership &gt;&gt; into this work of redemption. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, I can keep you here. The atmosphere is so good. I'm ready to preach. &gt;&gt; I can preach until 3:00. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wish I have money. I just preach and carry everybody out for lunch. You know, feel you in my way of apologizing to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you are so full. You know, the other day, other little girl, I had this in my mind. I said I was going to I was going to apologize last Sunday. I forgot. Uh, and I I was also going to uh uh uh greet all the January birthday people. Sister Ruth, Ariel, they all had the January. Is there any other January person here? &gt;&gt; Oh, Rafer, you are in January. Oh, okay. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Yeah. All the January people, I wanted to greet you. And the other day I thought about I said I was going to do that last week. I forgot. After after the the service on the 21st, I slip away because I was tired. Redeem call me on the phone and she says, "Papa, you say after service you will carry out for lunch. You said that after service you will carry every one of us out for lunch." I said, "Yes, baby." I said that. But where we wanted to go, we could not get a good arrangement, you know. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But if you can't carry everybody out, you you can still carry us out for. So in the back part of my mind, I'm thinking, okay, this child has reminded me that I made a promise to the church and I needed to come back. And uh because you know sometimes those things fall in the crack, but the people don't forget. You come back again, you start saying the last time you say you are caring for you, you take care of us. Don't come and say something that you don't keep your word. We are not children. Don't play with us. So I'm very sorry. You know, we couldn't do that. And one of the reason also you know uh uh I know very well I knew very well that the trustees will not support me on this especially coming from replacing the furnace you know and we still have the air condition to do in the in the spring you know so I knew that I can't bring full money to them. Amen. I can't bring full money to them. They already keeping the shelter over our head. So let's just manage with what we have. So I'm very sorry that I never kept kept that kept that talk but you being a good audience this morning. I would not want to carry you very long is 1:30 and uh uh that's that just where I wanted to go. But uh what I wanted us to see is that uh you know when God call us aspiring partners is is not to babysit us. He didn't call us to babysit us and just warm warm the benches. No. As we look into this and we go along, you will realize that God is just like that mother eagle. He's going to tear all the comfort from under you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's going to tear the comfort from under you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what comfort you think you are feeling now, he's going to tear it from out of you because he have a purpose and he's not going to fill at his purpose. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He has the devil here doing his work. But see around us, our city, people are while we are here, people are out there rioting. &gt;&gt; He's doing his work. &gt;&gt; I mean, things are sputing on on the media. &gt;&gt; It's all on the media. And here we are in this little corner talking about being inspiring partners with God. There's something that that must that must be able to inspire our heart. Lord, what can I do for you? &gt;&gt; What can I do in this time &gt;&gt; even something quietly? What can I do Lord? &gt;&gt; How am I involved in this partnership with you? &gt;&gt; What is my purpose? Because the devil is doing his I mean he's doing his own big time because events are being made clear by prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Events are being made clear by prophecy. And it's IN SUCH A TIME WHERE THE PEOPLE will be overwhelmed with things that are happening. They will all be panicking in their mind and in in their heart. You know fear reduces faith. You can't hold both of them at the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we see the devil on the run with what he's doing, we must be able to trust the Lord and say, "Lead me, Lord. I will follow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there is something little I can do, use me, Lord. If there is just something little I can do, &gt;&gt; maybe let my mission field be right in my own house. Maybe let my mission field be right in my own life. I can look at myself and ask myself, what is your purpose? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because God had a plan of redemption right before the foundation of the world. It's his plan. That plan of redemption was before creation. It was before creation. The whole plan of creation came out of the plan of redemption. If there is one thing that God have his eyes down on earth that he's guiding over is that plane of redemption because he said all that the father has given me I will not lose one. &gt;&gt; I will not lose one. No matter what is going on on earth, wars and troubles and famine, all that the father has given me, I will not lose one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? It does not only mean of God saving you. It means God's bringing you to your purpose. &gt;&gt; It mean God's h delivering you out of your struggle. &gt;&gt; It means God bringing you to the to to your fullness. &gt;&gt; Amen. that before your last birth is taken out of this earth, your purpose will be fulfilled &gt;&gt; or God's purpose will be fulfilled in your life. God bless you musicians, you can come forward. &gt;&gt; We'll continue. Praise the Lord. Amen. I'll take that. I'll take that. That's it. Thank you for clapping for me.

Living in such a time, oh God, Father, your word declare, Lord God, because iniquity shall abound. The love of many shall works cold. Oh God, we are holding so many things in our head. Lord, it's completely different from the reality in our hearts. Father God, Lord, I want to labor, Lord, under this subject of God and just show your people, Father, Lord, in this plane of redemption, in this plane of redemption. When the Bible says the the creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God is a portion in the plan of redemption, the opening of the seals was a portion in the plan of redemption. Calvary was a portion in the plan of redemption. When Moses lifted the brazing serpent, it was a portion in the plan of redemption. Oh God, this is our age, Lord. This is our time. What the Bible says, men will be unthankful, Lord. Father, men hearts, oh God, Father, Lord, will be failing for fear and all of these things will be happening, oh God. Lord, Father, to be able to see in this plan of redemption, you got you got co-workers. You got men that are co-workers, Lord. You got men, oh Father, that you have called, men you have raised up, oh God. Men you have trained, Lord, Father, to be able to stand for this age, oh God. Father, when we see all of the things and most of the things that are happening, oh God, we see all the the the h the disappointment, Lord. Father, we see the fall in the word. Oh God, we see people trapped into things. Trap into things, Lord. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Father, we know Lord God as we getting close to that capstone, Lord, the ship is getting tan. Father, Lord God, Lord, here we are this afternoon, Lord. Father, here we are, oh God. Dear Lord, we saying please help us, oh God. Please help us Lord Jesus. Please help us Lord Father. &gt;&gt; Come Lord God. Come. Oh God. Father, may we begin to see ourself, Lord God, not only as children, Lord God, now only as sons and daughters, Lord, but may we begin to see ourself as partners, that wherever you have placed us, Lord, wherever you have placed us, the people we live with, the people that are around us, Lord, oh God, you want us to represent you the best way we can. He want us to represent you, Father. Lord, oh God call Father. That little light of mine, Lord, let it shine, let it shine. Oh God, Father, if I can help, Lord, a wayfairing man Yes, Lord. Yes, Father. The Lord, that's where we stand with you this afternoon, oh God. That's where we stand with you this afternoon, Lord, and say, "Father, though God, we've been in battle, Lord God, though Father, the enemy has been throwing things our way. Oh God, he want us, Lord Father, to leave our work and start to do his work. He is the accuser of the brethren's, Lord. Father, he's the father of lies. Oh God, he's the one Lord Father. Oh God, the deceiver, Lord God. Lord, we we we have to be on this side of the fountain. &gt;&gt; A fountain of truth, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; When your word said, "Lie not unto one another, &gt;&gt; you give us a a heart, Lord, a place in our heart where we can come back, Lord God, and repent of our wrongs, oh God. Father, a place, Lord, oh God, where we can feel broken in our hearts, oh Lord Jesus, Dear Lord, please help each and every one of us. Oh God, Father, please help us Lord. Lord Jesus, whatever Lord God that is waring against your children, every spirit of resentment, every cloud, oh God, Father, every cloud of deception, Lord Father, Lord, every cloud that is trying to trap their lives, oh Father, Lord God, for them to miss their purpose, Lord God. Oh precious Lord, when our hands have to be in in in in a work of redemption, Father, doing the little thing we can, encouraging our children, praying for our wives, praying for our husband, and and helping one another. The Bible says, "Come, let us reason together, reconciling ourselves and say, "Oh God, forgive us. We are wrong. Give us grace. Give us another help, Lord. Oh, Father, all of these things, oh God, Father, we we we are called to be doing, oh Lord Jesus. Oh God, encouraging the brothers, Lord, Father, and praying for our young people, oh God, and just just finding something to do, praying for somebody, Lord. Oh God, place somebody on my heart, oh God. Oh Lord, Father God, let me just do something that is productive, Lord. Father God, let me do something, oh Lord God. Oh precious Lord Father God. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord Jesus. with everything that is happening around us. Everything that is happening, Lord God, there is just so much things going on. So easy, Father God, for us to &gt;&gt; be carried away, Lord, by all of these things. So, Father, while I would rather play that music. You know the story of the little boy that was flying a kid and the curt was was so much in the clouds that it could not be seen and a man came around and said boy sunny what are you doing? He say I'm flying the cat. He says where say I can't see it. He say it's in the clouds. He said how do you know that it stay there? He say I can feed the p. I can feed a po. And with everything that is happening around us, that is the thing that you don't want to lose. You don't want to lose. You want to feel the pulled. The pull that is say come up higher. The pull that is saying get out of your backsliding. Get out of your foolishness. Get out of your weakness. Let's just worship the Lord a little bit now. I feel the warm. Oh, I am the call. And I know his spirit moving me to give my all. Oh, you speak to me and I agree. Lord, please come and take control. I feel the Let's sing that one more time. I feel the Oh, I hear the call &gt;&gt; and I know your spirit move, baby. to give my home. He speaks to me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And I agree. Lord, please come and take control. I feel the I don't know about you, but I want to say this that talk we feel is from inside. The call, the call to make something right. The call to do something right. The call to get back. Get back to what is right. Every day we must not go a day without feeling the poor, without feeling. Lord, I thank you. You there with me this morning. Lord, I thank you. Thank you, Lord. You spoke to me. Lord, thank you. Just that consciousness, the Bible say Enoch walked with God. &gt;&gt; He walked with God. And that is the same way this bride of Jesus Christ is walking with God. That's the same way she walking with God. And one of these days her feet is going to get lighter. One of the days the things that hel her down are going to disappear. One of these days that the inner struggle, the things she struggle with, the thing that the enemy was using to plague her and condemn us, she's going to get lighter. But until that time, until that time, let identify those things in our life and say, "Oh God, help me in this area. Lord, I need you, Lord. I need you, God. I need you, Father. I don't want to go a day without the feeling and need for you. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, oh God, we we feel like that little boy. Oh God, the cloud is so thick. Oh God, and and things around us is clouding our mind, oh God, but we still feed the poor. We still feed a talk, Lord. And we know that God, you are on the other side of the line. Father I pray oh God precious Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; we have our young people young children oh God exposed to a generation oh God father that is becoming so crual oh God Lord where the life oh God father of man is just becoming valueless oh father God every day Lord is one death news and uh the earth is becoming blooded again oh God God, we we just feel it, Lord God. Such a such, oh God. Oh Lord God, that's the reason why we come to hide ourself away. We come Lord God to enter the chamber with you, Father. Lord, &gt;&gt; we say, "Oh God, oh God, Father, help our young people, Father, Lord, all those that don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, oh God, that don't have a real assurance in their heart, Lord Jesus, that is not experiencing the new birth and living in the new birth, Lord. needing victory, oh Lord God, Father, in one area of our life or another. Oh God, you know, Wednesday night, we pray for the couple. I took a spoken prayer request and uh Thursday morning we had a fly out to go and meet with them got there and visit with them a little bit sat down from 1000 p.m. all through the night until 10:00 a.m. And just to see how God sometimes will use some of the silliest thing, some of the simple thing to reconcile people back to the cross and reconcile. Sometimes when we just take silly things in our life and we allow our own selfishness to get a hold of us and we don't realize that we have a crew of beast in us that is ready to to destroy our lives. &gt;&gt; But just to see how the grace of God came down, just to see how the grace of God came down and the presence of the Lord just swept through the place and we all were in tears. Oh, all glory to the father. Lord, I thank you precious Lord. Oh God, knowing father God, Lord Jesus, we can walk right out of that presence. Oh God, and stay feed into our negativity, feed into the devil lies. Oh God, I pray for them. I commit them into your hands, Lord. Father, I say you are the mediator, Lord God. I reconcile men back to you. You are the only one that can reconcile us to ourselves. Oh father, dear Lord, I commit your children in your hands. Oh father God, as we go home, oh God, Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, remind us of this subject. You are our spiring partner, Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why you send us trials sometimes. Sometimes you rebuke us, oh God, by your spirit. Sometimes, oh God, Father, you teach us, you equip us, Lord, because you have called us into partnership and you want us, Lord, to represent you. Father, we love you. We appreciate you, oh God. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray father and your grace, your love and mercy go with us now in Jesus name. In Jesus name without you holding my hands. And can be one Lord without you holding my hand. Oh the mountain so high. Oh Lord of Valley to wipe up down on my knees. I learn to stand. I can't live in one without you. Holy. Oh yes, Lord God. I can. Yes, I can be walk without you. Holy my hands. Oh yeah. The mountains to h and the valley to walk.

And may the grace of God just go with each and every one of you this morning. May he bless and prosper you as you go throughout the entire week. We see you on Wednesday night. We see you on Wednesday night. Let's stand on our feet. There shall be seasoning refreshing sent from the father above.
