[51:01] the scripture tonight and I will I will
[51:03] uh introduce
[51:05] myself 1 John Chapter 5 Verse 18 we know
[51:10] that whosoever is born of God sinth
[51:15] n but he that is begotten of God keepeth
[51:22] himself and that Wicked one touch him n
[51:28] and we know that we
[51:32] are and we know that we are of
[51:36] God and the whole word lie in
[51:40] wickedness praise the Lord

[52:15] island of pmos he has experienced Jesus
[52:19] in another
[52:21] form he have experienced Jesus and there

[52:31] here so he said the Son of God is come
[52:34] and have given us an understanding that
[52:37] we may know him that is truth and we are
[52:42] in him that is truth even in his son

[55:29] wonderful people that we we came to know
[55:31] and uh so glad now
[55:34] tonight remember now we've been talking
[55:37] about uh uh I was actually going to go
[55:39] back into the power behind the the the
[55:43] ages that's what we were talking about
[55:45] on uh uh last week and uh yeah you know
[55:49] when we get into these things and then
[55:51] and then we have visitors and all of
[55:53] that uh um
[55:56] you know well I'm not a good preacher so
[56:00] it's half sometimes it's difficult for
[56:01] me to just get myself back immediately
[56:04] but I was I was intending to do it
[56:05] because I had it on my mind that we will
[56:08] you know we will continue in this line
[56:10] of thought that we were dealing with
[56:12] trying to show the the power behind the
[56:16] seals now uh uh uh Revelation I mean now
[56:20] last Wednesday we look at Revelation
[56:22] chapter 4 and and it it brought us you
[56:27] know uh the four living creatures and
[56:30] which of course is the power that is
[56:32] influencing the church praise the lord
[56:35] we we established there that the four
[56:37] living creatures is the power that have
[56:40] influenced the church throughout all the
[56:43] ages Amen in Revelation chapter 6 we
[56:48] also saw the power the way Satan has
[56:51] moved throughout the ages look here in
[56:54] joy and my preach of the restoration of
[56:58] the Bride tree he show us the four
[57:01] creatures that Jo talk about the Pama W
[57:04] the Cana W the locers and the
[57:07] calipat now that was the evil power of
[57:10] Satan in the Old Testament is the same
[57:14] as the four beast in the New Testament
[57:17] it's just the enemy changing form
[57:19] brother Brandon say it was one Beast it
[57:22] was one
[57:24] creature that came from aad P to a
[57:27] Locus and it change again to a conquer
[57:32] one and you know it just changed from
[57:34] one to another it's just the same evil
[57:38] power The Same Spirit that was working
[57:41] in uh that's the reason why Jesus could
[57:43] say as it was in the days of
[57:47] Noah how could it be in the days of Noah
[57:50] because it's the same
[57:52] Spirit the BS are there the BS are gone
[57:56] but the same spirit is the Same Spirit
[57:58] working among the
[58:01] people are we together
[58:06] amen are we together are we together
[58:10] okay let's say together praise the
[58:13] Lord hallelujah so that's why we wanted
[58:17] to go into tonight and uh but as as I
[58:20] was as I was just trying to gather my
[58:24] thoughts uh
[58:27] uh something came to my mind that's
[58:30] that's something I've looked at many
[58:32] years ago never really been able to put
[58:34] it into a context to preach on it but uh
[58:38] it's the difference between a begotten
[58:40] son and a son that is
[58:44] born so that's what I want to talk about
[58:47] tonight that's what I want to talk about
[58:50] tonight I want to talk the difference
[58:52] between a begotten son and the son that
[58:55] is born
[58:57] praise the
[58:58] Lord
[59:01] hallelujah
[59:03] amen so we
[59:05] will continue to trust the Lord to be
[59:07] able to help us as we will be looking
[59:10] into
[59:14] uh our our will study there on U the
[59:18] power because what what what actually uh
[59:23] I'm I was I'm trying to hear to with
[59:25] there
[59:26] is to be able to show us
[59:28] that this is the age of fullness this is
[59:32] the age the Bible talks about the men of
[59:35] sin amen how how the devil will will he
[59:40] will be able to achieve to have a man
[59:43] where he will fully incarnate In Praise
[59:47] the Lord amen he will get a man God has
[59:50] already got his man that was Christ
[59:53] Jesus where he he fully DW in Christ and
[59:57] now he's getting a people that he will
[1:00:00] also fully DW in so we that's that's
[1:00:03] where we going with that we just we just
[1:00:05] trying to look out of that but as we
[1:00:08] study that together I want to I want to
[1:00:11] remind you I want us to keep our mind
[1:00:13] you know keep ourself in a singleness of
[1:00:16] mind and to be able to differentiate
[1:00:19] these things
[1:00:22] uh if you if you look in Revelation
[1:00:24] chapter 5
[1:00:27] that's where the proclamation Was Made
[1:00:29] Who wed to open the
[1:00:31] book and to lose the seals thereof amen
[1:00:36] and the Bible says no man was wanted to
[1:00:38] open the book now if no man was wed to
[1:00:42] open the
[1:00:45] book but yet in here in Revelation
[1:00:48] chapter
[1:00:49] 4 we already looking in the
[1:00:53] book for us to have the understanding
[1:00:56] of the four beasts we are looking in the
[1:01:00] book think about it this book that was
[1:01:03] sealed that no man was wed to to touch
[1:01:07] take the book loose the seals thereof
[1:01:09] when the lamb came and took the book and
[1:01:13] loosed the
[1:01:15] seals when the lamb came down with the
[1:01:18] book The Lamb descended in Revelation
[1:01:21] chapter
[1:01:23] 10 and handed the book
[1:01:27] to a messenger that was on Earth but
[1:01:30] here said in Revelation chapter
[1:01:33] 6 John was called to come and see what
[1:01:37] is in the book but the book was handed
[1:01:40] down in Revelation chapter
[1:01:45] 10 so you see
[1:01:49] God place it in such a way that it will
[1:01:54] have to take a prophet to reveal
[1:01:58] right you can never read Revelation
[1:02:01] chapter after chapter and understand the
[1:02:03] sequence you
[1:02:07] can you can the book is open in in
[1:02:11] chapter 5 is handed down to the to the
[1:02:14] eff messenger in chapter 10 but yet in
[1:02:17] chapter 7 John was called to come and
[1:02:20] see what was in the book
[1:02:27] are you seeing the
[1:02:29] picture amen another thing that I want
[1:02:32] for us to also see is that
[1:02:39] uh the difference between the
[1:02:42] seal and the information of the
[1:02:47] seals what is the
[1:02:52] seal anybody what is the seal Christ
[1:02:57] Christ is the
[1:02:59] seal Jesus Christ is the seventh seal
[1:03:03] right are we
[1:03:06] together
[1:03:08] amen but when the first seal was
[1:03:15] open the angel said unto John come and
[1:03:19] see what was open now what was open was
[1:03:25] information
[1:03:27] it was
[1:03:29] information what is the Holy Ghost
[1:03:34] Christ amen was the New Birth
[1:03:41] Christ you see what is happening is
[1:03:46] there because just like it was in the
[1:03:50] beginning the devil knows how the human
[1:03:53] mind runs
[1:03:56] we love
[1:03:59] informations and it is easy to get lot
[1:04:02] of information and yet you miss the
[1:04:08] context praise the
[1:04:11] Lord
[1:04:14] amen Paul says the mystery to be
[1:04:17] revealed is Christ in you the hope of
[1:04:22] glory but we having the three stages of
[1:04:25] Grace justification sanctification the
[1:04:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost we having the
[1:04:30] new birth we having you know all all of
[1:04:32] these things are more
[1:04:35] information that God revealed to us how
[1:04:39] he's dealing with us but his primary
[1:04:42] purpose is for Christ to be revealed in
[1:04:46] you praise the Lord God is more
[1:04:49] interested in Christ being revealed in
[1:04:52] us then how much more we knows about the
[1:04:55] seals and what we know about
[1:04:58] justification and sanctification and how
[1:05:00] we can explain
[1:05:03] it you find people says well you being
[1:05:05] in the message you don't know
[1:05:09] this I rather know
[1:05:11] him because to know him is
[1:05:15] life
[1:05:16] amen to know him is
[1:05:20] life then to know all the informations
[1:05:26] and we can explain all the
[1:05:30] informations praise the
[1:05:33] Lord watch this in Revelation chapter
[1:05:39] 6 here is the information around the
[1:05:42] seal when the first horse rider came out
[1:05:46] because it was a
[1:05:48] white HSE amen
[1:05:52] amen and he came riding and
[1:05:59] conquering it was a spirit of
[1:06:04] deception because he was conquering
[1:06:07] people thought that thou was the Holy
[1:06:10] Ghost amen why because Christ was not in
[1:06:14] the
[1:06:18] picture are we
[1:06:20] together now so uh uh uh we we are
[1:06:25] hoping in trusting there by the grace of
[1:06:27] God we will we will be able to look into
[1:06:29] there I'm trying to you know trust in
[1:06:31] the Lord to be able to find uh some of
[1:06:33] the simplest way to be able to bring it
[1:06:35] to you
[1:06:36] amen so we can all enjoy it together
[1:06:40] praise the
[1:06:42] Lord praise the Lord if we make it
[1:06:45] complicated we'll be harming you then
[1:06:47] helping you so we want to make it simple
[1:06:49] but tonight just for the few minutes
[1:06:52] that is before us I want us to look at
[1:06:54] this together that uh uh John said here
[1:06:57] we know that whosoever is born of God
[1:07:01] sinth
[1:07:04] n but he that is begotten of
[1:07:08] God keepeth himself praise the Lord amen
[1:07:14] many years back way many years back uh I
[1:07:17] got attracted to this and uh
[1:07:21] uh I would say that yeah uh the Lord was
[1:07:24] dealing with me on
[1:07:26] in the sense of
[1:07:28] uh
[1:07:35] uh in a way that like I said I couldn't
[1:07:38] put it together to to preach a message
[1:07:41] out of it but uh
[1:07:49] uh well okay let's let's go ahead it's
[1:07:52] it's hard to remember what what I was
[1:07:55] thinking
[1:07:56] 12 15 years
[1:07:58] ago praise the
[1:08:00] Lord but this is what I want us to look
[1:08:02] at
[1:08:03] tonight we we want to look
[1:08:06] at something maybe maybe if I read this
[1:08:10] uh from brother Brandon it will help us
[1:08:13] uh from the fifth seal let's read from
[1:08:14] the Fifth Fifth seal it will give us a
[1:08:17] kind of a foundation year to be able to
[1:08:19] look at the subject together brother
[1:08:21] Brandon politely said uh uh in this he
[1:08:24] says excuse me again sisters being
[1:08:28] polite
[1:08:30] uh for this plain talk before
[1:08:33] young and I I think he meant older women
[1:08:36] young and older women but look when a
[1:08:39] mother is
[1:08:41] conceived and that little bunch of
[1:08:45] muscle is is twisting and jumping you
[1:08:49] understand it is a natural
[1:08:53] body and just as
[1:08:56] nature is uh performing The Natural Body
[1:09:01] did you ever notice your wife before the
[1:09:05] little one was born she's uh always
[1:09:10] right along at the last become real kind
[1:09:13] sweet if she hasn't been
[1:09:17] all of her life she will OB then did you
[1:09:23] ever notice how Sly kind of a feeling
[1:09:27] you notice a mother you see uh some
[1:09:30] sinner out there make fun of a mother
[1:09:33] that's a pregnant woman I think that's
[1:09:35] ridiculous
[1:09:36] amen he says that's life coming to the
[1:09:41] word amen she's bringing life to the
[1:09:44] word so brother B say she must not be
[1:09:45] teased she must be pray for she must be
[1:09:48] supported amen praise the Lord he said
[1:09:50] because there's Life
[1:09:53] coming but did you notice around that
[1:09:56] mother seems to be a real sweet feeling
[1:10:00] what is
[1:10:01] it it's uh a little spiritual body
[1:10:06] spiritual life waiting to come into that
[1:10:08] little body as soon as it's born now
[1:10:13] it's only
[1:10:15] begotten but when it's born it's
[1:10:19] born so while the child is in the womb
[1:10:24] the child is begotten
[1:10:27] but that's
[1:10:28] life are we
[1:10:31] together
[1:10:34] amen while the child is in the womb the
[1:10:37] child is begotten but that that is that
[1:10:41] is a living that's that's a human that's
[1:10:43] that's
[1:10:44] life amen but in the begotten State the
[1:10:50] child is is uh is is is being kept by
[1:10:54] the mother's life
[1:10:58] are you getting the
[1:10:59] picture the child is being kept by the
[1:11:02] mother's
[1:11:04] life because if you grab the picture you
[1:11:07] will see where we're going tonight

[1:17:10] God let's let's read uh another quot
[1:17:13] here with bringing out a little bit
[1:17:16] clearer for us question and answer there

[1:17:21] of this like I said I'm trying to get
[1:17:24] away from giving you too much
[1:17:26] information than just getting to the
[1:17:28] word amen so let me give you some
[1:17:30] information
[1:17:32] here praise the
[1:17:34] Lord Brother says here do you
[1:17:37] know when a baby is begotten in this
[1:17:42] earth before its deliver it got life
[1:17:48] amen when a baby is begotten in this
[1:17:51] earth before is delivered it gots life
[1:17:56] but it hasn't been
[1:18:01] delivered and just as soon as the baby
[1:18:05] comes it begin to it's born it lungs are
[1:18:10] all close up and it's there the
[1:18:13] muscles are quivering and jacking but
[1:18:16] the first
[1:18:18] thing just a little SP or two like
[1:18:23] that but B
[1:18:25] illustrating you know the baby grapping
[1:18:27] his birth Cas cash his birth what's the
[1:18:30] matter as soon as that natural body is
[1:18:33] being formed in the mother there is a
[1:18:36] spiritual body waiting to receive it
[1:18:39] just as soon as that baby is born praise
[1:18:44] the Lord hallelujah
[1:18:48] so John year now he says this
[1:18:53] that uh
[1:18:55] he says in verse 20 we know that the the
[1:18:58] Son of God has come and have given us an
[1:19:02] understanding and is is is that
[1:19:03] understanding that we want to look into
[1:19:07] tonight because you
[1:19:10] see uh uh saints of
[1:19:14] God this is this word that we give us
[1:19:17] rapturing Fai amen praise the Lord and
[1:19:22] rapturing faith will come
[1:19:26] when we begin to understand how God is
[1:19:28] dealing with
[1:19:30] us when we begin to understand that God
[1:19:33] is the one that is in
[1:19:35] control praise the Lord there was
[1:19:37] something uh brother Jordan said when he
[1:19:40] was praying on on on Sunday and it St to
[1:19:43] my mind you know brother brother Tim G
[1:19:46] gave a very beautiful you know
[1:19:48] illustration on uh our trials and you
[1:19:51] know when when uh you know when the
[1:19:53] father is teaching us you know he he
[1:19:55] talks but when we are going through test
[1:19:58] you know he don't talk because it's
[1:20:01] testing time amen praise the Lord so if
[1:20:05] if it looks like God is not talking to
[1:20:07] us we might be going through test if it
[1:20:09] looks like the Lord is not answering
[1:20:11] your prayer it might be a test amen
[1:20:14] praise the Lord but the beautiful thing
[1:20:17] there is that brother Jordan said he
[1:20:19] don't leave the room the examiner don't
[1:20:22] leave the room even though he's not
[1:20:23] talking but he's in the room he's
[1:20:26] watching over you praise the Lord
[1:20:33] amen now so the thing here is that U uh
[1:20:38] uh
[1:20:41] uh we have to understand how God is
[1:20:44] dealing with us praise the lord we want
[1:20:48] to put his work back into his
[1:20:52] hands and begin
[1:20:55] to start appreciating what he's doing
[1:20:58] then to think that we have something to
[1:21:02] do are we together praise the Lord
[1:21:07] hallelujah amen in the message of Christ
[1:21:10] is the Myster of God revealed if you
[1:21:12] study the message you will also see
[1:21:13] brother Brown talks about two wombs he
[1:21:16] talk about the womb of our mind and the
[1:21:19] womb of our
[1:21:21] soul praise the Lord he says we first re
[1:21:24] receive the word in our mental
[1:21:26] conception in the womb of our
[1:21:28] mind and when that word becomes a
[1:21:31] revelation then it drops down in the
[1:21:34] womb of our heart then the word will
[1:21:36] live itself
[1:21:40] out if it does not become a revelation
[1:21:43] it will just be an intellectual Faith
[1:21:46] you will just be guessing and missing
[1:21:48] and you know and thinking this and
[1:21:50] thinking
[1:21:51] that but when the word becomes a
[1:21:54] revelation then it drops down and the
[1:21:57] word is now ready to live itself out
[1:21:59] through
[1:22:00] you praise the Lord let's get back to
[1:22:03] our subject John says he that is born of
[1:22:08] God sinth not praise the Lord
[1:22:15] amen that is a place and uh uh I'm I'm
[1:22:20] I'm getting excited amen I'm enjoying
[1:22:22] myself here praise the Lord Lord maybe
[1:22:24] you will catch up to but I'm enjoying
[1:22:27] myself let's let's just look at this
[1:22:29] together we can we can look through
[1:22:31] through the scripture I might be able to
[1:22:33] go through here quickly and and then
[1:22:35] just just read couple of the scriptures
[1:22:37] to you you know that
[1:22:40] will that will
[1:22:43] uh that will bring this thing out uh for
[1:22:46] us
[1:22:49] hallelujah love the Lord amen now if you
[1:22:53] look at the word
[1:22:55] begotten if you follow the the the
[1:22:59] English definition we're not speaking
[1:23:01] English yet we speaking the word
[1:23:06] amen oh yeah it's a word that is used
[1:23:09] greatly but for God so loved the word
[1:23:11] that he gave us his only begotten son
[1:23:15] praise the Lord that word is used all
[1:23:18] through the scripture referring to the
[1:23:20] Lord Jesus and there are places where
[1:23:22] also the Bible use it refer to us that
[1:23:26] God has begotten us what does the word
[1:23:30] means that's what we want to look at for
[1:23:33] us to be able to appreciate the subject
[1:23:35] tonight so that begotten you know uh uh
[1:23:41] uh it have it have a it have a meaning
[1:23:45] in the in the Greek is a
[1:23:48] word that that uh uh that is called uh
[1:23:55] monogen if I'm pronouncing it right but
[1:23:57] what it
[1:23:58] means it means
[1:24:01] that the only one of its
[1:24:06] kind praise the Lord the only one of its
[1:24:11] kind when you have something that is
[1:24:14] very
[1:24:16] unique A Unique Kind let's let's uh
[1:24:20] let's let's look at it in the scripture
[1:24:22] that we will be able to appreciate look
[1:24:24] in the Book of
[1:24:26] Revelation Revelation
[1:24:29] 1:5 the Bible says and from Jesus Christ
[1:24:33] who is the faithful
[1:24:36] witness and their first begotten from
[1:24:40] the dead praise the Lord okay what makes
[1:24:44] it beautiful yet Jesus was not the first
[1:24:47] one that was raised from the
[1:24:50] dead was he the first one raised from
[1:24:53] the dead no he was not the first one in
[1:24:56] the Old Testament the man that he throw
[1:24:58] into Elijah grave he came back to life
[1:25:01] Elijah lay over the dead boy he came
[1:25:04] back to life Jesus was not the first
[1:25:09] one he he was the one that raised
[1:25:12] Lazarus back to life before he he even
[1:25:15] died but he became the first
[1:25:20] begotten which means the first one that
[1:25:24] came back to life that never had to die
[1:25:32] again praise the Lord amen I'm sure the
[1:25:36] man that they threw into Elijah grave he
[1:25:40] he he woke up his family was happy after
[1:25:43] s year he died again the boy that Elijah
[1:25:46] woke up he grew up to be a big he died
[1:25:49] also Lazarus have to die the second time
[1:25:55] but Jesus be he he became the first
[1:26:00] begotten from the
[1:26:05] dead that he came back to life and he
[1:26:08] never had to die
[1:26:12] again praise the Lord amen you see the
[1:26:16] Bible is is very
[1:26:18] beautiful the Bible can never attribute
[1:26:22] the first uh uh uh uh translated to
[1:26:25] Jesus because he was not Enoch was the
[1:26:27] first one amen praise the Lord Elijah
[1:26:32] was the second
[1:26:34] one but Jesus was the first begotten
[1:26:38] from the dead so which mean when he came
[1:26:41] back to life his case was
[1:26:46] unique so the word in the Bible that
[1:26:51] speaks of a begotten son
[1:26:55] it speaks of the term of being
[1:27:00] unique amen it speaks of the sense of ab
[1:27:06] would th prepare
[1:27:09] me so Jesus was a begotten son because
[1:27:14] he was not born of
[1:27:16] sex
[1:27:18] amen he was now born of a sinful
[1:27:22] nature he was begotten
[1:27:24] because his body was separated that God
[1:27:27] could step in
[1:27:33] it are you getting the
[1:27:36] picture
[1:27:39] amen
[1:27:41] hallelujah so you you have to understand
[1:27:44] the sense of
[1:27:45] begotten you are begotten because in
[1:27:48] this age God has chosen you to be his
[1:27:52] bride
[1:27:54] you are choosing you are set aside for a
[1:27:58] special
[1:28:00] purpose not just to be a church member
[1:28:05] amen praise the Lord you are begotten
[1:28:09] because God has chosen you to have a
[1:28:13] preeminence a people that he will have a
[1:28:16] preeminence a people that will put God
[1:28:22] first that's what this bride would
[1:28:25] be praise the Lord
[1:28:29] amen so that is the sense of the world
[1:28:34] begotten you are choosing for the
[1:28:39] purpose you have been called
[1:28:42] out are we together
[1:28:45] Hallelujah but when we look
[1:28:48] at when we look at it in a sense as we
[1:28:52] compare it to the place of the mother
[1:28:55] just like brother brandham said the
[1:28:57] child is begotten in the womb now you
[1:29:00] will realize in h understand that uh uh
[1:29:04] uh you know it's it's it's uh you you
[1:29:08] see this there are people uh uh uh take
[1:29:10] for example a man like FF Bosworth he
[1:29:13] was he was an evangelist on the field
[1:29:16] and uh you know he had preach and he
[1:29:18] have even retired but when he saw the
[1:29:23] the the the man estation or of the of
[1:29:26] the son of man Ministry in brother
[1:29:28] Brandon he came off of the field he got
[1:29:31] back into evangelism why God beg gotted
[1:29:35] him amen praise the Lord and I hear it
[1:29:39] said now this man that has been
[1:29:41] preaching many years is now going to sit
[1:29:44] down honor this young
[1:29:47] evangelist and and start learning what
[1:29:50] God is
[1:29:52] doing we have read it in the
[1:29:55] Bible praise the
[1:29:57] Lord the gift of discernment and Jesus
[1:30:01] talking to the woman at the word and
[1:30:03] telling her all the things that he have
[1:30:05] done here is the thing manifesting even
[1:30:08] though he prayed for the sake he was a
[1:30:10] preacher but yet he he's now being
[1:30:12] begotten he's now in a womb he's now
[1:30:15] becoming a baby to start learning again
[1:30:18] to grow in
[1:30:21] understanding praise the Lord
[1:30:24] you see that's the reason why no matter
[1:30:27] what experience a person have and and
[1:30:30] and and you know and and and what they
[1:30:31] will learning and in all of
[1:30:34] that when God gave a Grace for the man
[1:30:37] to come to the knowledge of Christ he's
[1:30:40] just like a baby that is beginning to
[1:30:45] form praise the
[1:30:47] Lord
[1:30:49] amen we are all every one of us we are
[1:30:54] all work in
[1:30:57] progress if you really want to look at
[1:30:59] the S we all have been begotten by the
[1:31:03] message and now we are in the womb of
[1:31:06] the
[1:31:07] message we are now growing and and and
[1:31:11] and the members of our body are growing
[1:31:14] praise the
[1:31:15] Lord when we come to
[1:31:18] maturity when we are
[1:31:21] born then that's when we become
[1:31:24] manifested Sons and Daughters of
[1:31:29] God just like the child that is born is
[1:31:33] no longer feeding on the mother's
[1:31:36] life
[1:31:39] amen even though that child has to suck
[1:31:42] the mother's breast but the child is not
[1:31:45] connected by an umbilical
[1:31:48] cord when a child is in the womb it's
[1:31:50] not sucking breast it's being failed
[1:31:52] directly
[1:31:55] praise the
[1:31:56] Lord are we
[1:31:59] together amen I'm bringing you to
[1:32:02] somewhere tonight and I'm I'm hoping
[1:32:04] that uh you know the grace of God will
[1:32:06] be able to to help us to grab it because
[1:32:10] because we get to this place where you
[1:32:13] know we think our many years in the
[1:32:16] message uh uh uh uh sometimes we we we
[1:32:20] we Knack ourself on the head and and say
[1:32:22] Sir well I should have known
[1:32:24] this praise the
[1:32:30] Lord and sometimes say you know what you
[1:32:33] know we we we we we we blame our husband
[1:32:36] we blame our wives and you know we we we
[1:32:40] we throw things around it's all because
[1:32:42] of our human
[1:32:44] expectation but let's look at it in the
[1:32:46] eyes of
[1:32:48] God
[1:32:50] Amen look at in the mind of God
[1:32:56] that baby that is in the
[1:32:59] womb it is it is the
[1:33:02] mother praise the Lord is the parents
[1:33:06] that are having expectation of the time
[1:33:09] that the child will be
[1:33:10] born the child that is in the womb is
[1:33:14] just is just flooring on the life that
[1:33:17] is being transmitted to the
[1:33:20] child praise the Lord all the child
[1:33:23] might have some spiritual m in the womb
[1:33:26] and kick you know here and there and say
[1:33:28] oh you you you feed the
[1:33:31] life and sometimes that's what happen
[1:33:34] when the church has a Revival and the
[1:33:36] people are rejoicing God feed the life
[1:33:39] that my children are coming to life the
[1:33:42] word is having effect in
[1:33:46] them but that does not means that we are
[1:33:50] to full manifestation
[1:33:54] praise the
[1:33:55] Lord Brother Braham says it's just like
[1:33:58] the little chick if you try to crack the
[1:34:00] egg you will kill that
[1:34:03] chick that chick has to grow and from in
[1:34:07] it starts to find its way
[1:34:10] out and that is the same way with the
[1:34:13] believer from in we will find our way
[1:34:16] out that sea word that is within us we
[1:34:20] find its way out it will bring this body
[1:34:23] to sub
[1:34:24] gestion it's now we it's now we
[1:34:27] manufacturing
[1:34:32] things and we said to this one well if
[1:34:35] you don't have the Holy Ghost that's why
[1:34:36] you are doing that you need to be born
[1:34:39] again and we get all fussy and and you
[1:34:43] know uh uh uh when when when things
[1:34:45] don't go the way we we we thought it
[1:34:48] should
[1:34:49] go we are so easy to throw words at one
[1:34:52] another
[1:34:55] praise the
[1:34:56] Lord amen are you seeing the picture
[1:35:01] tonight I hope the holy spirit will make
[1:35:03] it more clearer to
[1:35:05] you amen look at this
[1:35:09] example John the Baptist received the
[1:35:14] Holy Ghost while he was
[1:35:19] begotten amen praise the Lord
[1:35:23] but he was not born
[1:35:28] yet but yet he got a supernatural
[1:35:32] experience when the name of Jesus was
[1:35:34] mentioned the first time John live for
[1:35:37] Joy he got a supernatural
[1:35:41] experience but yet he was not
[1:35:44] born you see that's that is what is
[1:35:47] happening to people and and and that is
[1:35:49] the thing that is causing some of the
[1:35:51] disappointment that we we we are feeling
[1:35:54] because a person has been in the message
[1:35:55] 40 years 20 years and you know they pray
[1:35:58] for the sick or they been preaching the
[1:35:59] message and this I mean you are stay in
[1:36:01] the
[1:36:03] womb you are stay in the womb of the
[1:36:10] word God is waiting for your for the
[1:36:14] four member of your body to come
[1:36:16] together your understanding your
[1:36:18] discipline he's waiting for all of those
[1:36:21] things to come together and then you
[1:36:23] will be born and then there will be a
[1:36:25] short manifestation of the TPO and the
[1:36:28] bride will be taken away
[1:36:32] Lord praise the Lord you should be oh
[1:36:36] where is the manifestation the the the
[1:36:38] manifestation of the temple the
[1:36:40] manifestation of the
[1:36:41] temple praise the
[1:36:46] Lord are we
[1:36:47] together it's almost like brother Braham
[1:36:50] says that child you know in the womb
[1:36:52] enjoy the comfort of the womb and it
[1:36:55] looks like that is the best place to be
[1:36:57] but when a child is born it have no
[1:36:59] desire to go back in that small
[1:37:02] space is enjoying is enjoying a complete
[1:37:08] Liberty it can run to St Cloud and go
[1:37:11] down to Miko and run everywhere but
[1:37:13] while it was in the womb it was so
[1:37:15] confined you see that's legal
[1:37:19] Laing legalizing is a small space
[1:37:23] we can't do this our church say we can't
[1:37:26] do this our church in the Mage we can't
[1:37:28] do this your space is too
[1:37:31] small wait until you
[1:37:34] grow praise the Lord wait until you grow
[1:37:38] and when you are birth as a child you
[1:37:41] realize there is so much Liberty in this
[1:37:44] message Hallelujah then what you think
[1:37:47] is
[1:37:50] bonish oh the message just keep us in
[1:37:52] bonish it's because in the womb your
[1:37:54] space is too small that's why you think
[1:37:56] there is
[1:37:58] bonish praise the Lord
[1:38:02] amen but when a son is manifested you
[1:38:06] have you have so much Liberty you don't
[1:38:09] have to look around your shoulder you
[1:38:10] know who you are you know where you
[1:38:12] standing you are not living to please
[1:38:18] people your influence is not coming from
[1:38:20] on Facebook or Hollywood your influence
[1:38:23] is coming from the revealed word that's
[1:38:25] right brother bam says you are honor the
[1:38:28] Son and the son is beginning to re in
[1:38:32] you you are more concerned about what
[1:38:35] the scripture says what the message says
[1:38:37] about
[1:38:39] this that's that's that's a that's a son
[1:38:41] that is born because Jesus said I can do
[1:38:45] nothing but what the father shows me he
[1:38:49] was a
[1:38:51] son that was born
[1:38:55] amen he was begotten for that purpose
[1:38:58] and he was birthed to manifest the
[1:39:06] purpose are we
[1:39:10] together some people stay in a womb for
[1:39:13] 40 years and they never get the chance
[1:39:17] to be
[1:39:22] Birth s to say they die in stay
[1:39:27] breath because they never came to
[1:39:31] manifestation I was born in the message
[1:39:34] I've been in the message 20 years I've
[1:39:35] been in the message they were just in
[1:39:37] the
[1:39:45] womb are we together are you seeing the
[1:39:48] thought that I'm
[1:39:49] bringing praise the Lord because John is
[1:39:52] saying here
[1:39:53] the new birth comes open to
[1:39:57] us it comes in a different
[1:40:00] way praise the
[1:40:03] Lord Brother bam says in his Hills God
[1:40:06] birth he birthed his children by the
[1:40:10] word amen you know how Satan birth his
[1:40:14] children by the
[1:40:18] church who was the one to bring forth
[1:40:20] the first child of God Eve the woman
[1:40:23] she's the type of the
[1:40:28] church when God was bringing his son he
[1:40:31] brought him some by himself he said
[1:40:33] let's make men in in our image and the
[1:40:36] Bible said God make Men In His Image but
[1:40:39] when the devil wanted to bring his child
[1:40:41] he had to go through the woman and that
[1:40:44] is the same thing God is birthing his
[1:40:46] children by the
[1:40:48] word and the devil is birthing his
[1:40:51] children by the church
[1:40:56] does that blow your
[1:41:00] mind it confuse you no it should not
[1:41:04] confuse
[1:41:05] you it shouldn't confuse
[1:41:08] you praise the
[1:41:11] Lord it shouldn't confuse
[1:41:18] you because we have been birthed by the
[1:41:20] unadulterated word The Incorruptible
[1:41:24] seed which is the word of God that's
[1:41:26] what is bringing us
[1:41:30] forth are we together that's what is
[1:41:34] bringing us forth that's why we are here
[1:41:36] it's not just to be identified with a
[1:41:38] church or with a
[1:41:42] system praise the
[1:41:50] Lord so when you get oh this guy was in
[1:41:53] the message you were preaching the
[1:41:54] message all of these years you say I can
[1:41:58] believe it how people can do you should
[1:42:00] be able to believe
[1:42:02] it it's not every child that was in the
[1:42:04] womb that make it to
[1:42:06] life praise the
[1:42:09] Lord just like we all are in the womb of
[1:42:13] the
[1:42:14] earth not every human that is in the
[1:42:17] womb of the earth will be birthed onto
[1:42:19] the Golden Shores of Heaven
[1:42:24] they are gaining from the same Sun that
[1:42:25] we are gaining from drinking the same
[1:42:27] water the same air we all breathing it
[1:42:29] but when this F give birth is in birth
[1:42:32] pain right now when a give birth some
[1:42:35] will not make it on the Golden
[1:42:37] Shores are you getting the
[1:42:43] picture praise the
[1:42:49] Lord are we together
[1:42:54] so you see this it's it's just not
[1:42:56] enough for us to say we are in the
[1:42:59] message I was baptized in Jesus name in
[1:43:03] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:05] sometimes you say I will baptize in
[1:43:06] Jesus name people say no no say in the
[1:43:08] name of the Lord we we get so caught up
[1:43:10] in those
[1:43:12] informations is that it's hard for us to
[1:43:14] to bring forth Christ we're supposed to
[1:43:16] be bringing forth Christ and information
[1:43:27] are you seeing the picture praise the
[1:43:31] Lord by the word by the spoken
[1:43:35] word we have been
[1:43:42] conceived we have been
[1:43:45] captured we have been drawn to this
[1:43:47] place the word has got our
[1:43:51] attention it's just like that little
[1:43:53] child in the
[1:43:55] womb who is becoming to starting to
[1:43:58] become sensitive of the
[1:44:01] environment around science tells us that
[1:44:06] even while the child is in the warm they
[1:44:08] can sense our
[1:44:10] environment praise the Lord
[1:44:15] amen when the child is in in a musical
[1:44:18] place it give them a kind of for
[1:44:19] relaxing when when a child is in a place
[1:44:21] where they are all fing fing fing fing
[1:44:24] that child becomes sensitive to
[1:44:34] death now I'm not taking your I'm not
[1:44:37] taking your new birth away from you
[1:44:39] tonight I'm not saying that you're not
[1:44:41] born again I'm trying to bring it in a
[1:44:44] more Progressive
[1:44:46] sense because just like how we were born
[1:44:50] conceived in a womb and born in the
[1:44:52] natural life we are conceived
[1:44:54] spiritually and we will be born in a new
[1:44:56] body we are conceived in the earth and
[1:44:59] we will be born into
[1:45:09] heaven so you see that's that's the
[1:45:11] reason why you you I mean that's the
[1:45:14] reason why you you need to appreciate
[1:45:17] what where the grace of God is having
[1:45:19] you and how the grace of God is dealing
[1:45:21] with you
[1:45:24] praise the Lord because you cannot
[1:45:26] expect the child that is in the womb to
[1:45:29] be running around like the child that is
[1:45:31] already
[1:45:32] birth that's the reason why Paul says
[1:45:34] them that compare themselves with one
[1:45:36] another are not
[1:45:40] wise praise the
[1:45:45] Lord when the Bible speaks about sons
[1:45:49] that are
[1:45:50] born the Bible is talking about manifest
[1:45:53] a of the sons of God that's why John
[1:45:56] spoke right there for this reason the
[1:45:58] Son of God came to manifest destroy the
[1:46:01] works of the devil and manifest God
[1:46:05] that's the purpose that's the purpose we
[1:46:07] are here
[1:46:09] for but we can't do it if we are not
[1:46:12] birth
[1:46:14] yet we are stay in the womb is the
[1:46:17] atmosphere of the world that is keeping
[1:46:19] us and we need to grow in that
[1:46:22] atmosphere
[1:46:23] we need to grow we need to appreciate it
[1:46:26] stop building false
[1:46:30] expectations praise the
[1:46:39] Lord just like the way John experienced
[1:46:42] the holy ghost in the womb in our state
[1:46:44] of being begotten we still experience
[1:46:47] the Holy Ghost we experience the
[1:46:49] manifestation of the word I mean we are
[1:46:51] touched by this we have this experience
[1:46:53] we have that experience but you see you
[1:46:55] cannot
[1:46:56] build on
[1:47:09] experience Mary called the name of of of
[1:47:11] Jesus John was moved he did not born he
[1:47:15] was not birthed immediately he still had
[1:47:17] to go through full
[1:47:19] term with all your our experiences with
[1:47:23] still need to grow
[1:47:26] up we still need to grow up because
[1:47:29] there is a manifestation there's a birth
[1:47:31] that is awaiting
[1:47:35] Us Praise the
[1:47:38] Lord there is a birth that is awaiting
[1:47:45] us you think when that child is born and
[1:47:48] that baby is crying she care for who's
[1:47:50] the doctor whether they are looking at
[1:47:52] me they you know who looking at me who
[1:47:54] is listening to me that child that is
[1:47:56] born when they are crying they don't
[1:47:57] care for who is around
[1:48:00] them that's a sense of manifestation
[1:48:03] when people become so conscious and you
[1:48:05] know and no you you are still in the
[1:48:08] womb your space is too
[1:48:16] small praise the
[1:48:19] Lord you I sure you never expected it
[1:48:22] like this tonight
[1:48:24] say something completely
[1:48:27] different praise the
[1:48:29] Lord oh yeah we all need growing up to
[1:48:35] do manifestation of the sons of God is
[1:48:37] not just
[1:48:41] imagination it's not imagination the
[1:48:43] word has to possess this body now you
[1:48:46] trying to control it the word must
[1:48:50] possess this body
[1:48:57] praise the
[1:48:58] Lord and that's the reason why when you
[1:49:01] when you feel angry bring it under the
[1:49:03] word when you think stupid bring it
[1:49:05] under the word when you say foolish
[1:49:07] bring it under the word because the word
[1:49:10] has not possessed the body yet because
[1:49:13] as long as the devil keep us in a wrong
[1:49:16] thought that we are in the manifestation
[1:49:18] of God by this time I supposed to be
[1:49:19] doing this I supposed to be doing that
[1:49:23] and you realize if you Earnest to
[1:49:24] yourself you are not doing
[1:49:28] it if you are really Earnest to yourself
[1:49:30] you are not doing
[1:49:33] it you saying where where am I oh my God
[1:49:36] I can't believe oh my my spiritual life
[1:49:39] oh my
[1:49:43] sh praise the

[1:50:09] knew he was there for a
[1:50:12] purpose he knew he was there to fulfill
[1:50:14] the will of the
[1:50:20] father when you are so judgmental of
[1:50:22] people around you your space is too
[1:50:25] small you are in the
[1:50:28] womb don't get mad with yourself just

[1:50:41] manifested Son of God he manifested
[1:50:44] himself in on Earth he manifested
[1:50:46] himself in

[1:57:00] hope if that child in the

[1:57:14] amen they can hear the sound when they
[1:57:17] that that full age and seven eight nine
[1:57:20] months they can hear sounds
[1:57:27] I went to a shop one time uh uh uh my
[1:57:30] wife and myself and we're talking to
[1:57:31] this lady I think she's from South Korea
[1:57:34] and all of there there uh we looking for
[1:57:38] or I think uh iron was suspecting at

[1:57:44] talking about how her her her I think
[1:57:47] her niece back home started reading
[1:57:50] English book
[1:57:52] to the baby in the
[1:57:54] womb every evening she would take a
[1:57:56] story book and
[1:57:58] read and when that child was born it was
[1:58:02] not difficult for the child to start
[1:58:03] speaking
[1:58:08] English just listening to a testimony of
[1:58:11] another musician that every evening
[1:58:14] he'll play a song for for for the little
[1:58:17] baby in the
[1:58:20] womb and when the child was was born
[1:58:22] every time he plays on the piano that
[1:58:24] little baby tend to look why because the
[1:58:26] sound is
[1:58:29] familiar the sign had an
[1:58:34] influence now the baby can recognize oh

[1:59:29] grow up to
[1:59:31] it we need to grow up to it we need to
[1:59:34] bring our understanding it's not

[1:59:40] living itself through
[1:59:42] Us Praise the
[1:59:44] Lord is the word living itself through
[1:59:46] us look look at even our lord Jesus
[1:59:49] right at the point of death he couldn't
[1:59:53] get a hold of it he said no Lord not my
[1:59:56] will but your will let the word bring me
[2:00:00] subject because I was born for this
[2:00:03] purpose let the word get a hold of me
[2:00:06] death is looking
[2:00:08] scary but Lord get a hold of me let the
[2:00:13] word subject me let the word take the
[2:00:17] fear of death let the
[2:00:20] word he keep submitting himself keep
[2:00:24] submitting himself because he was born
[2:00:27] for that
[2:00:28] purpose and that's what Sons and
[2:00:30] Daughters of God do that's how we deal
[2:00:33] with our
[2:00:34] problems not by talking it all over the
[2:00:37] place and building Superstition and
[2:00:39] building all sorts of h h h fake story

[2:00:50] not happy with it
[2:00:53] I'm not happy with it I know it's not
[2:00:55] supposed to be so it's not according to
[2:00:57] your
[2:01:00] word it's somebody that is in
[2:01:04] control it's someone that is in control
[2:01:06] it's someone that is submitting
[2:01:07] something to the father not looking for
[2:01:09] who to
[2:01:14] blame well this thing is in our family
[2:01:17] this thing is in our family my my man
[2:01:19] say my P say is in our family is in our
[2:01:23] family that's the reason why you need to
[2:01:25] be born again because you need to get
[2:01:27] out of that family and be and and and be
[2:01:30] conceived in the womb of the word and

[2:01:35] a Son of
[2:01:42] God we be Earnest to ourself very
[2:01:45] Earnest to ourself we realize that there

[2:02:15] CEO came to see this new building that
[2:02:18] they were building uh uh you know for
[2:02:19] his company
[2:02:22] and uh it was about a kind of a certain
[2:02:25] amount of story building more than 10 12
[2:02:28] and up there you know and on the top
[2:02:30] they were supposed to do something
[2:02:31] special so uh while they were
[2:02:35] building you know he wanted to get on
[2:02:37] the top and see what they were how they
