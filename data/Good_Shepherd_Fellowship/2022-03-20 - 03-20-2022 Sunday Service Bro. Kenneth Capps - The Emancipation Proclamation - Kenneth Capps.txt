know i sometimes go to places and i sit in the office waiting to be called out and i just can't stand still i just uh you have to get up and walk or or dance or do something because of what god has done in this generation amen praise god well to get right into the message i don't want to hold you too long today i usually get done in about three and a half four hours so uh no i'm just i tell people i'm a short preacher in more ways than one uh praise the lord if you have your bibles turn with me to the book of isaiah this morning i'm going to be reading a couple scriptures i'll start reading in isaiah chapter 61 begin reading with verse 1 and then we'll turn over to luke's gospel and read from the fourth chapter but this morning we'll start out reading in isaiah 61 of uh the first verse amen isaiah 61 1 the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings into the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound verse 2 to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn verse 3 to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified and then turn it over to luke's gospel the fourth chapter began reading the 16th verse and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet essaius and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears praise god amen hallelujah let us pray heavenly father we come to you again this morning lord it's a great privilege for me to stand before this portion of the bride of jesus christ and lord we just pray for your anointing today lord we know many things within ourself but lord we can't preach anything unless you come lord we're expecting the holy ghost to come this morning we're expecting to receive from heaven lord if just one person here in this little congregation if just one person receives from heaven this morning lord it will be worth it all and lord we know that there's many things that can happen in a service with a congregation of this size we pray that this group of people hear from heaven this morning through the preaching of the word lord we give you praise we give you glory we give you honor for all things we ask now that you anoint my lips lord you ignore anoint the ears of the here that we may receive from you this morning we ask it in jesus name amen and you may be seated this morning it's just my great pleasure to be here and uh uh our uh your pastor told you i think last night i just come from the country of brazil he said maybe you can say just a few things about that you know we were in brazil we were there for three weeks we were in many different churches and they tell me that there's over ten thousand churches just in that one country and ten thousand message churches and it's we found it probably to be true we couldn't go to all of them but every city that we went to there was uh 20 25 30 churches in that city and they had enough for a convention of their own so we had uh actually three different conventions in different parts of the country and we've met some wonderful people some wonderful believers and they're just like you they believe in the end time message they believe that god has sent a prophet to bring us to this place to prepare a bride and they believe that they're part of that bride of jesus christ and i believe this morning that this group of people is that part is a part of that great body of the body of jesus christ so we had a wonderful time in in brazil and people were healed people were saved reports started coming in even before we left the country of uh some miraculous healings and and uh some deliverances and uh we had some baptisms so god was in it and we thank god for what he's done but this morning is a new day and we are not in brazil we're in minnesota and happy to be here here in our scripture reading today we find a prophecy given by isaiah the prophet now you all message people you know these things then over in luke's gospel we find that prophecy that was given in isaiah being fulfilled in the message entitled the jubilee year uh brother branham and it was actually preached in 1954 and in october brother branham preached uh now isaiah many hundreds of years probably between five and eight hundred years before this had prophesied under inspiration that christ when he came he would be anointed to preach the acceptable year of the lord then it brother brandon says it had to become just exactly that way for god through his prophet has spoke his word and his word must come to pass when a prophet of god speaks the word he's not speaking his own word he's speaking the thoughts of christ and that word has to come to pass and i'll just maybe tell you one little testimony and as i said last night i was i i was privileged to to be raised born and raised in jeffersonville and and i was privileged to be in those meetings of some of those great meetings and in 1963 after the seals were preached uh i was uh 13 years old and uh uh the deacons and the crowds when brother branham was there as you've heard and you know they were just fantastic there's people everywhere people standing along the wall three and four deep uh the the people on the uh uh uh sitting on the altar people in the baptistery they put a board down over the pool and they would set chairs there and there's there just was never enough seating so one sunday morning the deacon came one of the deacons came and spoke before the church and he said look it said as as deacons we would like for all the young boys 13 or 12 years of age and older to give up their seat so that people coming in from out of town would have people would have places to sit in in the congregation and being 13 years old i was one of those boys that gave up my seat that would have more seating for the adults and so uh now then then when brother branham came back in town there was a few more seats because those boys had given our seat up and we were supposed to go out and sit in the car and listen to the message on the radio which so many people were doing there was probably 400 people sitting in parking lots around just listening to the brother brandon's uh message on the radio because they couldn't get into the church and so we were supposed to go out and sit in the car but being being 13 year old boys we didn't always do what we were supposed to do we would we would listen for a while then we would walk down to the gas station get coca-colas and you know and talk about such things as boys talk about at 13 years of age but anyway i was one of those boys that that gave up my seat and so when brother branham came back in town for the next meeting my father who was a minister there in the church and song leader for brother branham uh he was invited to a meeting and he said the deacons had a meeting with brother branham and brother neville and and my father and and the deacons told brother bantam what they had done they told him that they had asked all the boys 12 years of age and older to give up their seat so they'd have more seating for people from out of town and uh my father was there when that was said to the they told the prophet what they had done and uh my father said when they told brother branham that he said he looked up like this and then he said oh that's fine that's mighty fine he said and i want you to know god will bless those boys for that someday well to me i felt like i just feel like that that was for me and i think i'm standing before you this morning as a spoken word blessing of a prophet of god because i've been blessed because the prophet of god said those boys will be blessed for doing that and i feel like i've been blessed and i just claim that promise i claim that for myself and i'm standing before you this morning as a spoken word blessing of a prophet of god amen all right now to get to the message here in our scripture reading this morning we find a prophecy given by isaiah the prophet then over in luke's gospel that we read we find that that prophecy prophecy has been fulfilled now in the message the jubilee year brother branham says now isaiah and and this comes from the message of brother branham entitled the jubilee year and it was preached in 1954 he said now isaiah many hundreds of years probably between five and eight hundred years before this had prophesied under inspiration that christ when he came he would be anointed to preach the acceptable year of the lord then it had to become just exactly that way for god through his prophet had spoke his word and his word must come to pass now that prophecy in isaiah had to come to pass just like the prophet isaiah spoke it was god speaking through a man and it had to come to pass there in luke's gospel jesus said he hath anointed me to preach the acceptable year of the lord and i'll ask you this question this morning church do we know what the acceptable year of the lord is and i know many of us do but i just want to read you a couple of things that the prophet god said about the acceptable year in the message entitled this day this scripture is fulfilled brother branham said notice the messiah standing in the platform to identify himself with the word of promise for that age i like that sentence he was standing in the platform to identify himself with the word of promise for that age church i believe that we're standing this morning to identify ourselves with the word of promise for this age praise god the acceptable year as we all know brother branham says the acceptable year as bible readers was the year of jubilee [Music] i say praise god the year of jubilee find my place here that was when all the slaves and all the prisoners as they were had been taken and put in prison and had to give a son to pay a debt or a daughter to pay a debt and they were in bondage no matter how long brother branham says they had been in bondage or how long they were supposed to stay there when the year come of the jubilee the acceptable year when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free you're free you was no more a slave at that point but if you desired to remain a slave then you had to be taken down to the temple stood by the temple post they took it all and bored a hole in your ear and then you had to serve that slave master the rest of your days and in the message entitled jubilee year we are told by brother branham now jesus was prophesied by isaiah to preach the acceptable year that's what we want to deal on tonight he said the acceptable year of the old writings the year of jubilee so we know this morning that the acceptable year is the year of jubilee it is a time to be set free from prison or bondage it is a time for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god amen now in john the 8th chapter the 32nd verse i'll just quote it jesus tells us you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free is that right and today church if there has ever been a group of people that should know truth it is this end time bride of jesus christ i was talking with brother steve and his wife on the way to church and they remarked that when they came to the message they recognized truth for the first time they knew that they had received truth church is a great thing when you can say you've received truth so if there's ever been a group of people that should know truth i believe it's the bride of jesus christ and if there was ever a time in history to know truth i believe it is this time this is the time that we can know truth if we desire to know truth the bride of christ has been given the truth of god's word by the omega ministry of jesus christ in this day through the son of man ministry of revelation 10 7 in this very generation now i'm from the south of the united states i'm not from the north in the in the south uh our churches are usually a little noisy we we it doesn't bother us when people say amen it doesn't bother us when people jump up and shout and i'm one of those people that do those things when i hear the word i don't have to preach but when i hear the word i get excited so if you hear something this morning and it excites you it's all right to say amen it's all right to jump up and shout and it's all right if you want to come up and shake my hand it's all right if you want to run the aisle i don't care i'll be running right with you god bless you this morning amen praise the lord so we know that the acceptable year is the year of jubilee it is a time to be set free from prison or bondage it is a time for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god amen and today if there's ever been a time to know truth i believe it is this time the bride of jesus christ has been given the truth of god's word by the omega ministry of jesus christ through the ministry of william branham through the son of man ministry in this generation where once again in this generation the priest handed the scriptures handed the bible to brother branham you know the story and he preached this day this scripture is fulfilled glory hallelujah to identify himself with the word of promise for this age [Music] for this age this age that you and i live in church this is not laodicea for the fraud this is the bright age this is rapture age this is judgment age it's time that we know who we are it's time that we get up and be about the father's business and what is the father's business i want to ask you this morning what is the father's business the father's business is ruling and reigning in royalty we are the royal seat of abraham and we're to be about the father's business we're to be about ruling and reigning in royalty and you can do that if you know who you are the church i can't tell you who you are the pastor can't tell you who you are you got to know by revelation who you are that you are mrs jesus christ you are mrs jesus christ [Music] do you know who you are this morning now i don't i don't want to get sidetracked i preached on that last night but i i could preach on it again today it's always good to know who you are praise the lord to identify himself with the word of promise for this age and i say are you with me now this morning you're right with me i believe you are amen the truth has been given to the bride body as a whole the bride body as a whole the truth has been given and we as individuals have to receive the truth we have to know truth and become intimate with truth with the truth of this hour as an individual it's not just good enough to go to a message church that believes truth that preaches truth and say well i'm here what are you going to do to bless me today no that's not how it works you may be attending a church that knows truth but you have to receive truth as an individual it's good that the truth has been given to the right body as a whole but you have to know truth for yourself as an individual and when you come to the knowledge of truth for yourself then you have entered into a jubilee year you have been entered into well glory you have been in you have entered in the acceptable year of the lord the spirit of truth has come and taken over your life and you know who you are you know who you're serving you know what this message is all about amen we have to dedicate ourselves to truth we have to have a personal relationship with truth have you had a personal relationship with truth this morning i believe i'm speaking to a group of people who has had a relationship with truth in their very own life as we said not good enough just to join a church that claims to preach truth you have to know truth for yourself you have to receive the holy ghost yourself that will lead you and guide you into all truth amen i don't know how i got sidetracked on that because i'm not really preaching on truth but it's good anyhow amen hallelujah now this morning in speaking about the acceptable year the year of jubilee i thought if it's all right it's all right with the pastor i believe it is i thought we might do a little history lesson this morning that'd be all right an american history lesson amen stay with me now this morning my title is the emancipation proclamation now i know other preachers have preached on this subject and i can't preach it like they preaching but they can't preach it like i preach so with your help this morning with your amens we're gonna speak on the emancipation proclamation now the emancipation proclamation is a great american historical document that set at liberty a particular segment of american society and as most of you know that segment of society was the negro slaves brought to the united states from africa to work the large plantations in the american south and we know that slavery was a terrible dark stain on america's history i went to the trouble of looking up the definition of the words emancipation proclamation in church it just simply means the proclaiming of freedom that's all it means the proclaiming of freedom so we're going to talk for just a little while this morning about the proclaiming of freedom and to set the stage for our lesson this morning i want to look at a few things that brother branham shared with us now in the message life story that he preached in orangeburg kentucky brother branham says i remember reading of a man that was born 100 miles from me a hundred years difference 100 years earlier in a little log cabin his name was abraham lincoln when he got off the boat down in new orleans one day he seen them auctioning off some colored people they auctioned him off as slave they'd take a big heavy man his poor little wife and children standing out crying and they would breed that bigger heavier man after they bought him like cattle to bigger heavier women to make better slaves lincoln as many of you know in the history when he folded his hands he saw that he folded his hands he smacked him together and he said that's wrong amen and by the help of god abraham lincoln said if it takes my life i'll hit it with all i got and he did now in the message paradox preached in april of 1964 in tampa florida brother branham said when i was a little boy i set reading my history book i was reading one day and seen there where abraham lincoln got off of a train down in here in new orleans and they was auctioning off big colored slaves down there to breed him to some bigger women to make better sleep abraham lincoln took his hat off he twisted his fist he was a kentuckian like i was he said that's wrong that's wrong brother adam said i still say it's wrong god made man man-made slaves can you say amen this morning and we as the bride of christ we are not to be slaves to anything we are not to be slaves to sin we are not to be slaves to the devil we are not to be slaves to denominations come on now help me preach we are not to be slaves to the world we are not slaves to big name personalities in the message look out brother kennedy whoa what did he say what did he say we are not to be slaves to big name personalities in the message [Music] we ought to be free to worship god in spirit and in truth in the power and the demonstration of the holy ghost church that's where i'm living i'm free to worship god in the power and the demonstration of the holy ghost and if it makes a 71 year old man like me happy to know about these things what should it do to some of you younger people hallelujah hallelujah amen [Applause] another little story by brother branham this is from the message go and tell my disciples preached in april 1954 brother branham said this he said i passed by a museum over in illinois here some time ago i seen an aged color man with a little ring of white hair around his head and he was walking around in that museum looking and after a while he stopped and tears began to run down his cheeks he backed off and started saying a prayer i watched him for a few minutes brother branham said and i was walking around too so i walked over and i said uncle what's the matter i see you crying and i noticed you're praying and that man said look laying there brother brown said i looked laying there and the only thing i could see was a dress he said sir only thing i see is a dress but it was the blood-stained dress of abraham lincoln's wife he said look sir he held up his coat in his shirt he said beneath my coat is a scar of a slave belt he said that blood on that dress he said that's the blood of abraham lincoln he said it took the blood of abraham lincoln to take that slave belt off of me brother and said i thought to myself if it would excite an old colored man because of the blood of abraham lincoln because it took a slave belt off of what the blood of jesus christ mean to the believer when we look back to calvary and we see there that he took the slave belt of sin from our hearts and he set us free that we've been talking about what a difference it is church we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth we should be shouting and praising god for the blood of jesus christ because we have been set free by that blood this morning this morning our text says jesus was anointed to preach the gospel to the poor to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives to recover sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruce to preach the acceptable year of the lord now the bride body as a whole has experienced all of these things that i just mentioned to you [Music] we've experienced all these things spiritually but you and i have to experience these things as an individual as an individual member that makes up that body of the wife of christ church it has to become personal to you jesus was anointed i'll go over it again to preach the gospel to the poor to heal the brokenhearted i don't know about you but i've had broken heart healed many times i've been poor to preach deliverance to the captives many of us were captives to denomination to recover sight to the blind told a sister last night about the testimony of john ryan this message gave john ryan back his eyesight at liberty them that are bruised i believe i'm looking at people this morning some of them have been bruised but they've been set at liberty because of the message of the hour and to preach the acceptable year of the lord to preach the jubilee year amen you and i have to experience these things as an individual member that makes up the bride it has to be personal to each and every one of us church the acceptable year is here what was this acceptable year it was the year of jubilee jubilee has come the bright age is here the bright age is going on right now not it is coming but it is here right now going back to the quote for just a minute there where brother branham said i remember reading of a man born exactly 100 miles from me where i was born and exactly 100 years of heart earlier he was speaking about abraham lincoln and i don't know if you've ever been to kentucky and over the steve hatz he's lived there but in kentucky there's a place called hodgenville kentucky and that is the birthplace of abraham lincoln and they have reconstructed the cabin the log cabin that he was born in but if you were to drive 100 miles exactly from hodgenville kentucky you would come to burkesville kentucky where brother branham was born and he was born exactly a hundred miles from and a hundred miles later than abraham lincoln was born said i remember reading of a man born exactly 100 miles from before i was born in exactly 100 years for me he was speaking about brother adam was speaking about abraham lincoln and we see that abraham lincoln a man from kentucky moved into a natural leadership role as president of the united states and that was the highest political office in the land and he moved into that leader leadership role as president of the united states at one of the most trying times in american political history it was a time of great war and great strife the american civil war it was a terrible time in america we had the north fighting against the south we had state fighting against the state we had family fighting against family and brother fighting against brother it was truly the greatest battle ever fought in u.s history it's a matter of fact that it was a bloody battle it was a great battle and in part it was for freedom freedom from slavery in the natural world stay with me now now this great american document the emancipation proclamation came at the end of the greatest battle ever fought in america it's a factual matter of history that the american civil war produced more dead american soldiers and casualties than world war one world war ii and the vietnam war combined it truly was the greatest battle ever fought in the united states but the proclaiming of freedom the emancipation proclamation came forth at the ending of this greatest battle ever fought and there was a segment of american society set free after this greatest battle was ever fought now in this day we have another great war being fought in the spiritual realm brother branham said it too is the greatest battle ever fought church i'm talking about the battle of the mind and that battle is raging we have people that have served the lord and served the lord in this message for 30 and 40 years and the battle is going on in their mind and many of them are losing the battle they're going back to the world they're going back to the nomination they're going back to where they came from the greatest battle ever fought it is known as the battle of the mind and once again there has been a great number of casualties spiritual casualties in this greatest war ever fought the greatest battle ever fought but god has once again raised up a man from kentucky 100 miles away and a hundred years apart from abraham lincoln abraham lincoln was born in hodgenville and whereas abraham lincoln moved into the highest political office in the land our abraham lincoln brother random if you can just stay with me on this a minute moved into the highest spiritual office in the land so the comparisons continue not only a hundred years later was he born and a hundred years apart but he moved into the highest spiritual office in the land just like that one abraham lincoln moved into the highest natural position of leadership william branham moved into the highest spiritual position in the land which was god's prophet to the last church age and he brought an emancipation proclamation he rocked a proclaiming of freedom to the bride of christ church he brought the acceptable year he brought the year of jubilee to the blood of jesus christ he brought it to the bride as a whole but you and i have to receive it as individuals oh it's good that we can come to church where he's brought that great proclaiming of freedom but you have to receive it in yourself it's not good enough just to come to church you have to know who you are receive that proclaiming of freedom amen we know we know this proclaiming of freedom as the message of the hour we know it as the opening of the seven seals we know it as the bride's emancipation proclamation now notice i said we know it as the opening of the seven seals i did not say we know it at the opening of the six seals we know it as the opening of the seven seals church it's already come what are you to do with it you have it on your hands today amen it is the bride's emancipation proclamation this bride has been set free from denominational bondage glory this bride has been set free from the devil in all his tricks this ride has been set free from all the message false doctrines and false revelations this bride has been set free from big personalities in the pulpit those that would do away with the five-fold ministry oh stay with me now brother kenny you're getting into a tricky area there no i'm not i'm telling you what the word says the bride has been set free from personalities that would do away with the five-fold ministry they would have you to sit home and listen to a tape and that's good i i like listening to tapes but that tape don't know your life you need a pastor you need a pastor a pastor that knows your life and knows what god reveals to him about you you know jezebel one time she had a pastor his name was elijah brother random she didn't receive him as her pastor but he was her pastor just the same and you know what his words about her would come to pass whether she came to church to hear eliza or not his words about her church we need to be careful your pastor he may speak words that affect you and if you're not even maybe you don't accept him as your pastor but his words if you are truly to set under his leadership his words about you may come to pass anyhow it's not a time to be changing churches it's not a time to be looking for new pastor it's a time to know your position know who your pastor is because his words may well affect you whether you receive him as your pastor or not we have to be careful church we are free to worship god in spirit and in truth we are free to worship in the power and the demonstration of the holy ghost praise god the proclaiming of freedom has come the acceptable year has come the jubilee has come and the true bride will be victorious and claim her victory in this greatest battle ever fought the battle of the mind if she can accept the pardon that's been given that that seven seal message brought she too can go free we all know the story of the slave who was brought to america and they took him to the big auction where they were auctioning off slaves and he didn't participate in all the the games and the gambling of the other slaves as they were waiting to be uh put on the auction block he sat alone and the slave owners noticed him and they went to his owner and they said tell us about that slave why is he different why is he different we want to buy that slave and the owner wouldn't sell him he said well he said what is it that sets him apart he said because in his home country his father is a king and he's been taught to present himself as a king he knows that someday he's going to inherit the kingdom [Music] no we can't sell that one he knows who he is he's had a revelation of who he is and someday he's going back to inherit every part of that kingdom church we are we have a king as a father we are to inherit many promises of god but we have to know who we are church we have to conduct ourselves as children of a king you come to church you dress different than the world comes to church you talk different than the denominational churches you walk different why because you're the child of a king and you know someday you're gonna rule and reign in royalty i say praise god praise god for a group of people who know who their father is and they know that their father is the king of kings and the lord of lords and we will conduct ourselves as children of a king we will know who we are without a shadow of a doubt church we must know who we are where we're going and what we are to do amen in this great battle of the mind if the bride can accept the pardon that's been given through that seven seal message she and the individuals in that bride can go free now when abraham lincoln set those negro saves free he was very specific he set forth a certain day in the emancipation proclamation speech when those slaves could go free in the message letting off the pressure brother branham said i was reading some time ago about the emancipation proclamation it was a time when they had slavery down south those slaves had been whipped they had been beaten and they had been abused church history itself tells us these things but when the emancipation proclamation was signed it was specific it set forth a certain day and that certain day was january the 1st 1863 and it said at the rising of the sun at the rising of the sun stay with me now all those slaves could go free all of those poor decrepit heartbeaten slaves were so anxious to go free they were excited they were so glad to be able to go free that the strongest of them stay with me now the strongest of them of those slaves climbed to the top of the mountain on that special day and the night before that special day they would go up to the top of the mountain on the last day of 1862 because they knew at the rising of the sun on january 1st 1863 they could go free they wanted to be the first ones to see the rising of the sun so the strongness among them they climbed to the mountaintop and they wanted they waited for the first streaks of the rising of the sun why because they were excited about going free i believe i'm looking at some of god's people who have climbed up the mountain because they want to go free they want to see the rising of the s-o-n not the s-u-n but the rising of the s-o-n [Applause] brother and said the strongest of them slaves climbed to the top of the mountain some not quite so strong climbed part way up the mountain then the weaker ones some of the women and the children they were still down in the valley but the great big strong husky ones they climbed all the way to the top of the mountain and they were up there long before daybreak they wanted to see the first rays of the rising of the sun they wanted to go free and they looked and they looked until they began to see the first streaks of the rising of the sun oh they were on that mountaintop but you know what it was still dark halfway down the mountain it was still dark down in the valley but there was some that wanted to see the first rays of the rising of the throne brother random said the strong ones on the top of the mountain they saw the first streaks of the rising of the sun there on the mountaintop and they begin to shout we are free we are free we are free halfway down the mountain it was still dark they hadn't seen the first rays of the rising of the sun but they heard the shout they heard the shower one they heard the shout we are free and they begin to shout we are free we are free it was still dark in their life they were still dark in their situation and their circumstances but they heard the shout have you heard the shout today there's a shout in the land and those down halfway down the side of the mountain they begin to shout we are free we are free well down in the valley where some of the weaker ones were some of the women and the children it was still pitch dark down there but they heard the shout the shout was relayed down to halfway the mountain and the shout was relayed down into the valley and they begin to shout we are free we are free hallelujah we are free glory are you free this morning are you free if you're not free you can go free this morning you can be set free glory to god glory with god we are free we are free it is the rising of the sun the sun is rising and we are free we are free and the shout went down the mountain and the ones part of the way down the mountain they heard the shout they picked it up and relayed it down the mountain into the valley and they were crying we are free we are free and so it was it was still dark where some of them were out but they heard the shout out oh my there's been a shout today church [Music] i believe that's the reason you're in this church and not in some big mega church not in some denomination because there has been a shout that's come and that shout said you can go free hey amen glory amen down the mountain down the valley it went it was still dark but they heard the shout they believed the shout now they could have chose not to believe the shout say oh i don't see nothing what are they yelling about you could say the same thing i can stand here and tell you that the shout has come through the message of william branham you can choose to believe it or you can choose to say i don't know about that stuff but i believe i'm looking at a group of people who believes to shout they've heard the shout they believe the shout and they believe that they may still have dark circumstances in their life they may have dark situations in their life but they have heard the shout and they're ready to shout they're ready to dance hallelujah [Applause] praise god [Applause] [Music] those slaves could now go free [Applause] why because they heard the shout they believed the shout out [Music] [Applause] what was it church it was quickening power being made alive producing freedom for those slaves amen the rising of the sun will always produce quickening power we talked last night about putting the seed in the ground and when the sun shines on it it has to come to manifestation the rising of the sun was the signal that those slaves could go free they could throw down their hoes and the thing they were working in their ground with i said i've said this before they they threw down their hoes and then they had a hoe down y'all know what a hoe down is if you're from the south you know a hoedown is a time when you come together and you rejoice and you celebrate and you're free to worship god amen they had a hoedown they could now go free brother branham says in the message letting off the pressure church that was the s-u-n he spells it out but oh brother now the s-o-n has risen the sun has risen we are free spiritually he said hallelujah the signs of his resurrection is right among us jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he is not dead but he is alive forevermore the s-o-n is up the s-o-n has risen we can shout and praise god the s-o-n has risen he said and we live he's with us he's in us he's vindicated his presence with great resurrection signs and wonders do you believe it this morning he said the s-o-n has risen the slaves to sin the slave to church denomination the slaves to churchianity and the slave to all those things you are no longer slave you have been set free the son of god has raised with healing in his wings and the s-o-n has risen he said i'm so glad of it [Music] but remember church it was after the greatest battle ever fought when it was over and when you and i can gain the victory in our greatest battle ever fought the battle of the mind many of us have been there we've we've fought that battle you know i can remember as a teenager there seeing all these miracles that brother random did and you know i've testified i can testify for three hours about all the the miracles i've seen not things i've read in a book or heard on the tape but things i've seen with my own eyes and i had to fight a battle who was this man because there was people that saying that was jesus christ and i fought that battle i think anybody who's seen those things have fought a battle but i had to come to the realization and the revelation that this man was not virgin born this man there was no way there was no way he could be god he was a man he was a prophet of god with the word of god and when he spoke the word it set people free but when you can gain victory and maybe your battle of the mind was different i don't know but when you can gain victory over the battle of the mind that greatest battle ever fought then you too can go free amen oh my hallelujah after the greatest battle ever fought was over and when you and i can gain the victory in our greatest battle ever fought the battle of the mine then we too can go free we too can know the acceptable year the year of jubilee amen this morning the bravest and the strongest among us have climbed to the top of the mountain brother ranum brother neville maybe brother perry greene maybe brother belo doan they've climbed to the mountaintop they've seen the rays the first rays of the rising of the s-o-n and they are shouting this morning in their churches in their congregations we are free we are free [Music] and some of the some of us that couldn't quite get to the top of the mountain we heard the message we heard the shout you can go free and we're shouting on down to others we are free we are free oh my hallelujah and there is still church no doubt there are still some weaker ones maybe among us who are down in the valley they're in the valley of indecision they're in the valley of doubt they're in the valley of fear they're in the valley of no finances but revelation 22 and 17 says the spirit and the bride say come church if you're part of the bride you have to find those that are still weak down in the valley and you have to say come come see a message come hear a man amen see what god has done in this generation praise god glory my mama many people still down in the valley of darkness they haven't seen the s-o-n rise yet but if they are an elected seat of god they'll have to see it maybe you've got a part to play to get them to see it but if they can hear the shout and if they can believe the report from the stronger ones they too can be set free amen be set free from the slavery of sin be set free from denominational bondage be set free from sickness or poverty whatever it may be whatever they need to be set free from they can be set free say brother kenny are you sure about that do you know for sure what you're talking about yeah because it happened to me jesus christ is the same history today in prayer what he did for me he'll do for you the same he'll do for those down in the valley he'll do for those each and every one who's got problems in their life who have dark situations who has dark circumstances in their life [Applause] he's a god of deliverance he's a god of healing he's a god of finances he's a god whatever you need him to be why are you just giving praise this morning take about 30 seconds and give him praise but if there are those down in the valley of darkness [Music] and if they can hear the shout if they can believe the report from the stronger ones up on the mountaintop or halfway up the mountain they too can be set free they can be set free from everything that besets them church today the bride of christ has now received her emancipation proclamation through the preaching of the seven seals she too has received her freedom our abraham lincoln william branham the angel messenger of revelation 10 7 has brought us a message and it has set us free if you can receive it the end time message has brought us the rising of the s-o-n and we can shout we are free we are free indeed and now we must remember that the prophet taught us natural events type spiritual events and in light of that this morning i'd like to take a look at some of the things that history shows us about these two great men from kentucky now church what i'm going to tell you most of you probably know these things these things i'm going to tell you the world knows nothing about these things and you know what they don't want to know you just try to tell them you just try to tell some 40-year denominational person about what god has done and they're going to blast you pretty good but you and i as the bride of christ we can know these things and we can rejoice in these things because we know the secrets that the bridegroom has whispered to us through the great love letter that christ sent to us you know there was a time in jericho when rahab had her family there and two spies came and they talked to her and they gave her a secret the rest of jericho knew nothing about the secret but she knew the secret and that secret saved her life you and i have been given a secret this morning the bride of christ has received a secret and that secret has set us free [Music] the rest of the world knows nothing about the secret but you and i know about the secret this secret will set us free this secret will spare our life and this secret the world doesn't want to know anything about it but we know the secrets that the bridegroom has whispered to his bride through the great love letter that christ sent to us through our abraham lincoln william branham and only the bride these things that i'm going to mention to you only the bride can understand understand these things and see the importance by revelation now what i'm going to read to you are some of the remarkable comparisons between those two great kentuckians and i know many of you know these things probably mo there's probably more that i'd i know there's more that i just didn't don't have room to write but i just want to go real briefly here abraham lincoln was born in 1809. william brown was born in 1909. abraham lincoln was born in a log cabin in hodgenville's kentucky william brandon was born in a log cabin 100 miles away in berksville kentucky abraham lincoln moved to southern indiana as a young boy william branham moved to southern indiana as a young boy abraham lincoln had no official church membership william branham had no official church membership abraham lincoln was a non-denominational believer william branham stood fully against denominations abraham lincoln was elected to congress in 1846 william branham was commissioned by the angel of the lord in 1946 are you with me this morning abraham lincoln was assassinated by a roman catholic william branham was killed by a drunken roman catholic abraham lincoln fulfilled the highest political office in the land william branham fulfill the highest spiritual office in the land abraham lincoln his wife was with him at was with him at his death william branham his wife was with him had his death abraham lincoln was shot in ford's theater and killed william brandon was killed in a in an accident in a ford automobile abraham lincoln died in 1865. william branham died in 1965. abraham lincoln had his face carved in a mountain mount rushmore by man william branham had his face carved in a mountain by god on mount sunset i've been there i've seen it i can show you a picture of it abraham lincoln sounded liberty through the emancipa emancipation proclamation for the negro slaves in 1863. william brandon william branham sounded liberty for the bride of christ through those seven seals in 1963. church the world knows nothing about it they don't want to know you try to tell them and they're going to laugh at you they're going to mock you they're going to make fun of you oh it means nothing that's just coincidence is it is it do you know who you are if you know who you are these things mean something to you praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah amen those slaves had a jubilee year in 1863 100 years later in 1963 after the natural slaves were set free in 1863 god's bride was set free if you can receive it this morning our abraham lincoln told us that if america had accepted this gospel message this emancipation proclamation in 1956 she would have no more need of doctors or hospitals but america as a nation they rejected the spiritual proclamation of freedom she rejected her pardon and a pardon is only a pardon if it is received as a pardon and i know most of you probably know the story of the soldier in the civil war he was a young man he never been in the war before he never had to carry a rifle and shoot people before and he ended up going awol he left the army and they caught him and they were going to try him as a deserter and he had a friend who when they sentenced him to die he had a friend who said to him look i'm going to go see abraham lincoln i'm going to get him to write you a pardon and you'll be set free so the friend went to see abraham lincoln and he asked him and told him the story about the young man he was just a boy away from home and kind of sheltered all his life and he was just scared to death and he he didn't he really wasn't against the north but he just uh he just had to get out of there he said mr lincoln could you sign a pardon for this young man and abraham lincoln just took a little scrap of paper and he wrote ah abraham lincoln pardoned and gave the boy's name and the friend rushed back to his friend and he gave him the note he said look look he said the president has signed a pardon for you right here he said and the man who had been sentenced to die he looked at it and he said you're mocking me he said abraham lincoln didn't sign that he said if it was a pardon from abraham lincoln he would put it on official white house stationery he said you're just mocking me you're just making me and he rejected the pardon he had the pardon but he rejected the pardon so they put the boy to death and his friend wasn't ready to give up he saw an attorney and he explained to him what happened he said look they put this boy to death and he said i i i had a pardon for him right here and they went ahead and put him to death and according to the prophet of god it went to the highest court in the land and the supreme court looked the matter investigated the matter and they said the government did nothing wrong because a pardon is only a pardon if you receive it as a pardon amen and he said the young man didn't receive the pardon now how about you and i today there's been a pardon given from sin there's been a pardon given from denominational slavery are you going to accept the pardon but you know this pardon came from a little old kentuckian who didn't know how to speak properly he he misspoke all of his words he he was poor he was uneducated and there's many people that rejected the pardon because they said oh no if it was god's prophet he would come in a mighty way in a jet airplane with the best suits and the best clothes the best cars and they rejected the pardon but there's a group of people on the face of the earth who did not reject the party i believe i'm looking at one of the groups of people today we did not reject the pardon we saw it as a pardon we saw it as truth we saw it as what god has done in this generation and we've accepted it we've reveled in it we've we've taken it it's been part of our life this pardon is what i live for this pardon is what brought me to this place today this pardon is gonna take me to glory someday and this pardon if you can accept this party if you can receive this party as a pardon god has a place for you you and i will rule and reign in royalty we just have to accept the pardon as it's been given amen our abraham lincoln told us that america could be going free from sickness and doctors and hospitals she would have no more need of those things but america as a nation rejected her spiritual pardon her spiritual proclaiming of freedom she rejected that pardon and she did not receive it as a pardon but the proclaiming of freedom has come church and the true bride will accept the proclaiming of freedom this morning the true ride will know who she is and she will recognize truth she will recognize the truth of the pardon she will recognize the truth of the shout she will recognize the truth of the message we are free we are free she will be victorious the bride has received the acceptable year the year of jubilee in 1963 at the opening of the seal now i don't know how long i've been preaching pastor told me not to worry about it well i you know usually don't preach over four hours but now this morning as we try to close oh by the way do you know what it means when a message preacher says i'm going to close do you know what it means it means absolutely nothing because he's going to go on and on and on but as we try to close you know in another place brother adam said a man told him one time do you know which of those slaves brought the highest and best price brother brandon said no the man said it was the prettiest healthiest young black girl that they could find they would want to take that prettiest young girl and breed her to the biggest strongest man the man told brother random he said i think that's terrible he said it's horrible he said he told brother and he said i hope those slave owners souls fry in hell brother branham said i looked at that man and i said sir that may be true but what about your soul this morning brother brahm said i told him you have been given a pardon for the sins and the bad things that you have done in your life but have you accepted the pardon brother branham said a few days later a pastor friend of his baptized that man in the name of jesus christ church tonight or this morning that's what the man of sin satan wants to do with the prettiest healthiest young spiritual woman that there ever was that would be the bride of christ satan wants to take the bride of christ this most beautiful bride and put her on the auction block and sell her to the highest bidder he would like to take her and sell her to the man or the preacher with the most false doctrine are you with me he would like to take her and ravage her and pervert her from god's original plan but we know he can't do it we know that the bride cannot be deceived she will be victorious she is an overcomer by her testimony and the blood of the lamb she has overcome and i believe i'm looking at some overcomers this morning [Applause] church once again the acceptable year the jubilee year has been preached what about your soul this morning have you accepted the pardon that's been given i like this little church got a lot of young people in it i like young people i used to be one i married one but what about you this morning young person what about your soul this morning have you accepted the pardon that's been given i want to read you one more thing as the musicians come back i've told you now i'm a short preacher in more ways than one i don't preach long you can play softly amazing grace something in that order i went to the internet and i downloaded a copy of the original document the emancipation proclamation maybe you've never done it i don't know that you have to i want to read you one small portion of that original document it was it was a they have it on the internet it's a copy of the original emancipation proclamation that abraham lincoln signed and it just starts out by the president of the united states of america a proclamation whereas on the 22nd day of september in the year of our lord 1862 a proclamation was issued by the president of the united states containing among among other things the following and there's a bunch of things there i'm just going to read you the the part i think that maybe would apply to the message this morning and this this document says that on the first day of january in the year of our lord 1863 all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state shall be fenced forward and forever set free and the executive government of the united states shall bring to bear all the military power of the united states against anyone trying to keep a person in slavery will guarantee the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons or any of them that they may actually be set free now the part i i wanted to get to here was the united states shall bring to bear all the military power of the us against anyone trying to keep people in slavery now we've said many times last night and this morning brother branham taught us that natural things type spiritual things now in the natural if the united states government is going to bring to bear all the military power and the force of the united states against anyone who tries to keep someone in slavery i want you to look at what's happening today today [Music] if some denomination or some preacher or some false prophet is trying to keep in slavery god's people the government of heaven will bring to bear all the power of heaven bringing all angels all seraphims whatever they have to bring to make sure and guarantee that god's people stay free church you don't have to worry you don't have to doubt you don't have to fear because the government of heaven will bring to bear any organization any individual who tries to keep you in bondage he's ready to go fight for you in every way possible as long as you know who you are nobody no individual no organization no church no denomination can put you in slavery and keep you bound [Music] church we have a message where the power of heaven will be unleashed against anyone who tries to knock you down and keep you bound i say glory to god church it says that the government of the united states will bring to bear all the power of the us government including all the military forces to ensure all the slaves would remain free whatever may happen and today our heavenly government will bring to bear all the angels and all the power of heaven to ensure the freedom of the bride of jesus christ there is nothing that can keep you in bondage today if you dedicate yourself to the lord jesus christ your freedom has been guaranteed by the emancipation proclamation of this day of this age if you're here this morning you've never been made free you can have liberty
