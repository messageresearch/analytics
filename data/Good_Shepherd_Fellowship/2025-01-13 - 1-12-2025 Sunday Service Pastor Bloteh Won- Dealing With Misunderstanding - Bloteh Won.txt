you the Lord bless you and if I'm pronouncing this right it's uh Deandra DeAndre DeAndre okay okay thank you thank you for coming to fellowship with us we appreciate you uh being in our midst praise the Lord amen amen now Wednesday night strangely after the prayer meeting we got into we got into a subject and uh uh and then it couldn't leave my mind so this morning I'm going to continue from where we stop amen Wednesday night we were looking at uh uh just after uh we we got praying done praying for the little exhortation we spoke about uh a sense of dealing with misunderstanding but we just read read a scripture and read a quote concerning hegen and uh uh uh when the little child ishmail was crying and um Sarah had to P hagga out and all of there that was what we spoke on uh uh on on Wednesday night praise the Lord and uh uh sorry let me just take um this was this was what we read a little bit and I think uh of the remembrance of the Lord again at a place of refreshment in The Well of uh be her which means in the Hebrew a well of him that liveth in serth mean heg misunderstood yet in the line of duty misunderstood Miss George she was cast out with no place to go with a perishing child and the water was spin in the bottle so that's what we were looking at Hegel was uh in the situation she was uh she was cast out by Sarah and uh uh so we in a sense we were looking a little bit of how do we deal with misunderstanding how do we deal with misunderstanding how do we deal when we feel like we've been misjudged how do we handle it how do we deal with it and I want to continue a little bit and and and as I was uh uh studying I was looking through my notes I preach uh this message dealing with misunderstanding back uh April 4th uh n uh uh 2014 right in this church so it's hard for you to remember what happened that day so it's a good thing that it has been over 10 years so I can preach it again I can preach it again but I'm going I will go in a different in different direction uh I was I was looking through my notes I knew that uh I've spoken of something like this before and and the did came up uh April 6 2014 so but uh this is a new day amen this is a new day so we want to look at this subject of uh uh dealing with misunderstanding when you being misjudged how do we handle it praise the Lord how do you how do we handle it and uh I was looking at uh that a little bit last night and I was just thinking and I think the reason we are misunderstood and we misunderstand one another is because we are peculiar people praise the Lord you will soon understand what I mean by that but the reason why we are misunderstood and we misunderstand people is because we are all peculiar people we are all peculiar people and uh and in that same regard misunderstanding is the greatest evil the greatest evil the greatest evil is that we all want to be understood and never want to understand others we all want to be understood praise the Lord but the patient the grace of understanding others we don't have it but we want people to understand us right you want I want I want you this morning to understand what I'm saying praise the Lord but then I have to bear with you and realize that you might not understand what I'm saying you might be so occupied in your mind that your body is just here and your mind is somewhere else I must I must I must come to that F so when when uh when I feel uh the spirit of uh uh distraction or resentment that a preacher must come to that f i I should I should come to the place where I'm I'm I'm not frustrated over it just as much as I want you to understand my message I want you to understand that when I take longer time to preach I want you to understand there too because that is the greatest evil we all want to be understood but the grace impatient of understanding one another we don't want it we don't want to exercise it right and I mean that's why we have the problem that we we have in in in I mean in our lives in in our homes relationship and uh uh even at work dealing with people you know uh if you don't realize that and put in the time because there is no two person the same there is no two person the same we are all peculiar amen and the word peculiar is so profound that we travel a little bit and look at that in the in the scripture praise the Lord are we together are you okay are you going to make effort to understand me praise the Lord don't know don't get so quick to be mad at me amen I I say some things that you don't agree with but uh just just say why he said it where is he coming from because if you don't understand me you might just take it that I'm attacking you that's why you might take it to be young man how are you good good are we together amen so I call that the great evil of the word we all want to be understood and never want to make the time and uh to understand one another we don't want to put in that and that is the reason why we Face a lot a lot a lot of problem I mean most most especially when you get down into our family problem most of the the divorces is just because she's not understanding me and she said he's not understanding me praise the Lord I want her to understand me and on the other side she say I want him to understand me are we together so we going to travel a little bit but let's let's look at this word let's look at this word peculiar from the Hebrew the word has a name SES GLA that's that's the Hebrew name I know I'm slaughtering the word because uh uh with with all the asent on top the there's a way your tongue must be able to carry it but trying to pronounce it the best that I can this word the concordant said the uh biblical concordant said is a feminine passive participle of an unus use root meaning it means shut up something that is covered something that is closed something that is hidden you see the reason why we must make effort to understand is because you are looking at mean year but the real me is hidden behind this flesh amen amen you says I know him he's uh he's 5'6 you know uh he's uh you know he's have funny glasses on his face and you know and I mean that just what you see you really don't know me it's from uh um I'm going use root word to shut up it also means wealth it also mean we wealth as closely shut up it means a uh a jewer diamond gold so it give you the sense of why precious stones are peculiar because you just can't go on the road and find it you can't just walk on the road and find diamond no they are hidden in the earth that's what makes it peculiar because it's not commonly seen it's hidden in the earth praise the Lord I won't I can uh remember uh uh uh uh a great little story that is told of uh uh one of uh the word great boxer muhamed Ali it says there you know his daughter was coming to see him and uh you know going to see her her daddy she kind of her dress up you know like a like a teenager would dress or the young you know W and with all all faction thing and shut blast and shot you know and all of that and then he uh talked to his daughter and said to her and said uh said honey you know why uh you know how they get diamonds she said no she says well you know they uh there are people that that that go and look for it they explore the Earth they dig the Earth you know and and they take out the diamonds and then uh you know and then they have to wash the rocks to be able to find the diamond and he was telling her in the sense that things that are precious things that are valuable you just don't expose them like that being the father he was trying to bring a wise counsel to his daughter he did not appreciate the way she dressed but he was trying to say it in a way that she will appreciate it instead of being offended praise the Lord amen and uh I mean the society just get the whole thing outside down and it's just so crazy you know well uh you see you know guys who will will love their wives to be pretty much naked and they be walking so everybody can see see see what I have PR that's crazy if you really treasure this woman she must be only for you she's cover if she's peculiar she's cover that's what the word peculiar means something that is shut up is closely hidden a treasure a proper ghost special that's what the word peculiar means now God will speak to to uh Israel Exodus chapter 19 if we want to get there quickly Exodus chapter 19 I'll take you through a little drill here like I said try to understand me uh I'm I'm praise the lord it's like two guys talking and the guy says you are not understanding me he says I understood what you said he says okay what was I going to say you just said that you came from the place and uh and uh and uh and you never allow the guy to finish how did you say you understand him praise the Lord amen Exodus chapter 19 God speaks to Israel here in Exodus chapter 19 and this this is a very this is a very the uh uh wonderful chapter here M let's read uh from verse uh four verse three and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying th thus shall th say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptian and how I be you on Eagle wings and brought you to myself praise the Lord now therefore if ye will obey my voice in the and keep my C then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine praise the Lord now when you read this in the way that we will understand it like we understand English keep that verse up for me please the way we will understand it like we understand English if ye obey my voice which mean God God is requiring the people to and and and if you keep my Covenant then if you do this then you will become this praise the Lord that's the way we will understand it that's the way it appears but that's not really what it is I'll show I'll show you why I say that's not what it is praise the Lord amen because what will happen right here in Exodus chapter 19 is that this is the place where the people choose law instead of Grace right this is where Israel made their filter mistake this is the chapter where they said everything that God said we will do that's this is where the Lord was introduced now because because they did not understood what he say here just like I'm saying we don't understand it because in the way it appears the way we read English in our understanding we will understand that God is requiring us to obey his voice he requiring us to keep his commandment now even if you look at this fact the Commandments is not given how can he tell them to keep his commandment the Commandment is given in chapter 20 right that's right so is God requiring them something or is it something he's trying to tell them that they are not patient to listen and they came quickly and said everything that he said we would do praise the Lord I heard a story from uh a great preacher he went to be with the Lord and uh he told this little story of a man that went uh you know travel over to China went to a restaurant supposed to be in an international restaurant he went to eat and then uh uh after he was sitting down bed and you know give the man um $100 or so a Big Bill and he was waiting and you know in those kind of restaurant they try to get people that speaks a little bit of English and when he started asking the guy for his change he says he says where's he says where's my change every time the guy come around he says where's my change you know and the guy told him you know and uh because sometimes he he was trying to process what this guy was saying you know his little bit of English he was trying to bring it together so but he captured the word change and you know the the Chinese uh uh education teaches that change comes from within so so the Chinese man taught he say where is change with a little English you know so he he just change comes from with being you know he thought that he didn't wanted to embarrass the man so he just went to his ear and Whisper change comes from within but he misunderstood you see and that's the picture you because there is more to this that God is saying than what the people understand are we together okay I could stay on this the rest of the the evening Deuteronomy chapter 14 let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 14 now so when you look at this theonomy 14 you will see here let's read verse one and two ye are the children of of the Lord your God ye shall NE cut yourself not make any bance between your eyes for the day for thou are Unholy people unto the Lord and the Lord has chosen thee To Be A peculiar people now if you know the setting of Deuteronomy is that this was almost Moses last message to the people before he will leave them now this was the same Moses that just spoke to the people uh after the Red Sea Exodus chapter 19 was just after the cross the Red Sea in Exodus 14 praise the Lord now here is Moses now speaking to the people just before he will leave them but here his language changed a little bit he's not telling them that if you will obey my voice because definitely we know that the people did not obey the voice of God for the 40 years that they were in the wilderness until I mean they put so much pressure on Moses until the Lord is not going to allow him to go into the promised land he's giving them his last word but it looks like he's bringing out the picture more clearer than he said it in the beginning are we together amen amen yeah he's not telling the people if thou will obey my voice if thou will keep my commandment he's saying to the people for thou are you are a holy people unto the Lord you are a choosing people you've been choosing to be a peculiar people unto him above all the nations that are that are upon the Earth you know so he's bringing this out he's trying to make them to know you are a peculiar people are we together amen and you will see that that thought travel alone and and and over in the New Testament you'll find that Titus said the same thing to his church you find that Peter said the same thing in his gospel you are a chosen generation you are a peculiar people you know he he keeps saying it to to uh uh to the people so you realize that uh uh uh and even when we read Psalm chapter 106 the Bible say that that was the same thing with the people they did not understand they never understood what God was doing they never understood the Lord what he was doing it's also because God is peculiar we have a peculiar God that has a peculiar people praise the Lord amen amen but you see the problem the the I mean the the the the the the thing here is that God don't need to understand us because he made us he factioned us amen our our the thing characters that we have that make us different from one another he gave us those unique identification and so much that the Bible says he put a number to every strain of our head he number our head that's how detailed he is are we together so you see that is the reason that's the reason why misunderstanding is such an issue because the person that you uh trying to understand you never made him praise the Lord amen amen amen there was a story also about uh you know the guy that was driving a h a fall vehicle it broke down down the road and this gentleman came and just pull his card he said what's wrong he said well I I you know I been driving this vehicle he says okay take it easy tell me what's the problem you know he explained and after saying the guy just went there he says how did you know he said I made it I put it together I work with General motive I designed this vehicle just tell me what the issue I can fix it and that's the same thing with God he desire you praise the Lord he knows exactly where your problem is he knows exactly what to touch and your life will never be the same you trying everything but he knows exactly what he can turn around and your life will never be the same are we together I have this I have this bunch of things that I wanted to bring to you this morning and uh uh in in the way that uh you know we we uh we deal with one another and all of that and and you know our our requirement to one another you know yeah that's the reason that's the reason uh you know we have all of our our differences and and um you know divorce cases in the word and and uh all because of uh unforgiving spirit the ability to put things under the blood and that that is not given to everybody and that ability is only given to them that are cleansed by that blood they are redeemed they have acces praise the Lord but what I what I wanted for us to look at is uh you know uh uh I try to go through it quickly or El I could I could just um Rong what I want to share with you this morning there are some there are some responsibility you know this this is something that I I pick up one time just looking through the scripture sometimes I do that you know I just I just take a verse take a phrase and run it through the scripture and just see you know how much the Bible put emphasis on it yeah what I was looking at is the emphasis the Bible put on one and one another one another how how how much the Bible especially to the New Testament Church the scripture put emphasis on our responsibility to one another praise the Lord our responsibility to one another just like we're talking about understanding dealing with understanding you know there is no way you can sit to yourself and by yourself and think you will understand me no you will just be coming up with Illusions in your mind you be coming up with things in your mind praise the Lord amen there is no way because if I don't tell you I have a cross eye there is no way you know I have a cross eye so there I mean there is just no way so for you to be able to understand me or for me to be able to understand you we have to make some effort there are some things that we must do nature make us responsible that way we must be able to fellowship with one another we must talk with one another we must we must be able to uh H uh I mean spend some time even if it's just a little time and all of those things develop the interest that we have in understanding one another now our responsibility to one another uh uh St John Chapter 13 uh uh there Jesus speaks about watching one another feed in St John 15:17 he talks about uh uh uh love one another he says this is the Commandment I have given you that you love one another praise the Lord amen and uh in Romans chapter 12 thing the Bible says we must prefer one another are we together and you see this is the is the lack of these things the lack of fa that's what create this problem of misunderstanding are we together the lack of it I'm trying to make it simple again I'm trying to make myself I'm doing the best I can so you can understand me you buy the vehicle you love the vehicle but yet the vehicle comes with a manual that tells you how every part on that vehicle operate you fall in love with the vehicle so much you say you love it and you never spend time to look in the menu pretty soon what is going to happen that vehicle you love you're going to sit down right inside and says I'm a frustrated with this vehicle what's wrong and sometime nothing wrong the only thing wrong there is that you never took time to read the manual I don't I don't even know how to wind the but the windows down oh my God how how how do I even put the heat on that's the reason why it comes with a manual so the problem is not the vehicle the problem is you you're frustrated you you're knocking all things down and and say why because you saw the vehicle you like it you know what and and and you all you want is just jump inside and press the speed and everything and now taking time to be able to read the manual of the vehicle you soon get frustrated but you sit right there and you come you slam the door you go in you take it take the book and you you go through you said that little bu right in the middle there if you touch it uh it's for snow it locks the whe of your vehicle and uh you can drive it like it's a four wheed and what you say oh wow oh wow it's a all we oh wow I love it praise the Lord amen but if you never read it you don't know how it works the vehicle is spinning around oh my God oh my God oh my God this vehicle will kill me no it won't kill you you will kill yourself praise the Lord you will kill yourself why because you are not making time to understand the thing you love the thing you love you took your money to go and buy you are not making time to understand how it works you see so the scripture says here thatth we must prefer one another uh be of the same mind to one another that Romans chapter 12 and uh uh Paul here in Romans 14 said do not judge one another praise the Lord because the reason why we judge one another is because you don't understand what that person is going through right it's just because of misunderstanding misunderstanding is the base of all the most of our problem praise the Lorden amen if misunderstanding is not a problem then sin is it because that's what the nature of sin set us for it set us to misunderstand are we together amen admonish one another receive one another I love this one I love this one greet one another oh my God oh my God I love this one praise the Lord amen because we dwell with people some right in the house we sleep with them to greet some of the things that supposed to be the easier thing right to do just say hi God bless you and because sometimes you don't make that effort depending on the uh the kind of a mindset the person in they will just misunderstand what have I done to this person I want to what's going on here then and before you realize they start to they start building clean up things praise the lord we came through that door you know sometimes you you there you know you you see people they come through then and uh they just come they hang their coat up they just come inside look for their seat to sit down I mean you see people they GRE them come on now great them say oh God bless you good to see you y you come and sit downside someone you just dress stretch your hands oh God bless you create one another amen what what happen what what it does is that it relax your spirit around that person am it bring a sense of exception receive one another that's some of the things that is killing the church is some of the things that is killing the church let me tell you this morning uh uh uh uh Paul says know ye not that you are a temple of God yeah God has only one Temple right only one temple in the actual sense you are just a piece of that Temple so that that's sense where people think that you have your individual Faith because that's how the church is being run everybody is an individual no the church is a body amen right amen amen it's a body and just like your body your body is governed your body has a governor it has an engine your body is govern your heart the the the the the the Vibes of your heart your heart have four Vibes it used two to pump out it use two to take in and that's the same way the church is not just individual work individual come and do individual things no we have a governor this Bible is the governor that's why we have four gospel just like your heart have four Vibes amen you find it right in homes right right in homes husband wife parents children everybody want to be live an individual life that home will soon die it will soon die that's right because everybody running for their own thing no connection right and the cell phone now has make it worse it have make it W I need to get down to what I want to talk about this morning I'm only trying to help you to understand what I'm saying and not even started saying what I'm saying now so you see then and and and that is and that is the think you know that that is the think where uh uh uh when you when you see people trying to P you know the the the science agenda they are trying to you know uh uh uh disbelieve God and and uh uh what what is the major thing of science what do science do everything that science have invented they will always tell you that they discover that's what science is all about it's about disc discovering praise the Lord and then if they are discovering it means that somebody cover it for them to discover it everything that science invent is a discovery they did not put it there it was there it existed and they came and find it this electricity was discovered right if it was discovered which mean somebody cover it somebody place it there for them to be able to discover it are we together now so when you get when we get into that place and uh and I mean that's the thing that is killing the word today oh my god let's let's just read something here maybe it will help me to to get on on the right track here is this the sound of the end s is this the sound of the end see people Miss George te you know Jesus one time after his resurrection was walking down the shore with his Apostle and John was leaning on his bosom he said what what will happen to this man Jesus said what what is it today if he T till I come and there went out a saying that John was going to live to see Jesus come and the scripture say how be it he never say it that way praise the Lord so this this is just this is just a picture of even the disciples walking with our lord Jesus praise the Lord amen knowing of what the angel said about his birth and and and uh uh the the angel visited his mother mother and the kind of a lifestyle that is saw this man uh you know the the life that he live and and uh St John chapter 4 when they got right there the Bible says they went about to find something to eat they came when they came back to meet Jesus he was right there to the well with that uh uh uh uh Samaritan woman the Bible says describe that they all stood back why because according to their religious tender they know that the their Pharisees Pastor will not be playing with a woman like that will not be even having a conversation with a woman like that so to them now they all watching what is he doing how how is he stepping so low don't he know that that woman is is is that kind of a woman you see if they would have just turned back and go back to the city they will carry Romans to the rest of the disciples but Wa A whyde and see what kind of a conversation that he's having with a woman and here is he telling the woman go and call your husand and the woman said I don't have husband he said yeah you said the truth because even the one you are with is not your husband and right away they realize that you know this woman is saying oh my God I perceive that you are a Prophet when the Messiah cometh he says I am he so because they took time to wait they could have Mis judge what they are seeing with their eyes but because they took time to wait and they saw the result praise the Lord they saw the result this woman that had a hidden private life she was able to throw the water bucket down R into the street and say come and see the man that told me the things that I have done but people Miss George things people Miss George things we said the same thing of Sarah uh she was the one that told hega you know come uh uh uh be with my husband and now ishad is born and now she's Mis judging that this girl is morg her how ha God is put away and ha God also is misjudging H H Sarah to be a crural woman that's what misund understanding does praise the Lord that's what Mis understanding does are we together we were playing this tip this morning God being misunderstood it was right from the subject that I thought we should listen to that you know misunderstanding get us in a lot of trouble many times that people say things that they repeat after somebody else where they make misunderstood them that get a person in trouble I believe it would be good for us if we were just well wait till we understand what we are talking about praise the Lord amen you see because the way we are made the way we are made that's what I want to get to now if I if I can be able to to uh uh let's read this from mechis the great prince in the way that we are made like I said we are peculiar every one of us there's three element that a man follow in uh in uh uh subsequent messages he said there's three element that a p people door in you know so it it's it's something that makes our our the way we deal with things here on Earth you know it's in the realm of the these three element the first is uh the humanistic and that's where we all are we are humans that are governed by five senses to contact our body our our body our flesh and we have uh five senses that we use to contact our spirit imagination affection you know memory conscious and uh uh uh uh and then we have uh uh a sense of the Soul could be either Faith or doubt depending on where the person is in their relationship with God are we together now so as Hans we are in this realm as humans we try to understand things as humans praise the Lord and uh if we hear something we rely on our hearing to to uh you know to prove what it's right then there is a second realm which is a divine revelation and the third R is uh thou said the Lord and many times we are down year and we never claim into this which mean we are in this humanistic realm you you read in the Bible the Bible says that uh uh uh uh in the book of Hebrew that every every man that comes to God must believe that he exists and with our faith it is impossible to please God are we together so it it makes us to realize that faith is another realm above our himmer that's right okay because because de with God understanding God that's where the misunderstanding comes because just like what we just read from Exodus chapter 19 if you read it literally you would say well but but this is what the Bible is saying but if you study the word as a progress in uh in uh H H exhalation and explanation you realize that oh wow it's deeper than what is been said because you see God is not at our level he's not a man that he should Li he's not a human praise the Lord he's Divine so for God to be Hood we have to step a little bit out of our human realm and come to the place of divine revelation that's what faith is Faith is a revelation are we together and that can only come by the new birth it can come by membership it can come by contribution it can only come by the new birth to be born again and that's the reason why we have all of the confusion because a person can pick up the Bible see see see see what what what the Bible says you know sometimes I see some of those things you know uh people post things there on YouTube see what the Bible say and it said and you are saying wow did he read the verse before that and the verse after that why because we are using our human mind our human way of understanding to be able to read God's word and satisfy ourself that we are reading what the Bible says or what God's word says are we together Paul says in Corinthian no man can understand the things of of man except the spirit of man is in him and that is the same thing with God no man can understand the things of God except the spirit of God is in him so you see how that misunderstanding comes that is with the Divine the misunderstanding with ourself is because we are peculiar we are peculiar the thing about life on Earth is there we are born we are placed here to discover ourself every stage of your life you're going to discover yourself that's what we are doing every stage of our life you get a job you you go to to a job and it train you and you you know you you train at a job and then uh from the beginning you get there you look at all of the equipment you say oh wow wow but then as soon as they start training you you realize that uh there there there's there's an attribute there's an ability in you that you did not know you had so what you now discover that you can do do that and the reason why we are discovering ourself is because we are peculiar have you have you ever heard parents say this I mean children say this parents also say it well I never knew this thing about this child or the child would say I never knew my daddy can do this praise the Lord amen and as long as we live there are a lot of things that you never knew that you will know because the people that you are dealing with they are peculiar they are there their abilities that are in them their potential that is in them is even hidden to them you ever hear somebody says I never knew you can do that I myself I never knew I could do it why because the ability was there and he never he just discovered that he could do it oh wow since when you've been playing drums or since when you've been doing this oh I never knew I could do that you know I just I just it just I I just try it and and I I found myself doing it it's being there all this while it's it's being there you can look at both negatively and both positively even some actions of uh of of people that you love that comes out and you you just oh wow I never knew that that person can talk like that or they can curse like that or it's oh wow that's something that was healing there praise the Lord that's the source that's the source of of all of our misunderstanding in the himay is because we are all peculiar amen we are all peculiar people our God is also peculiar praise the Lord hallelujah and he's he's he's he's he's bringing us to this place you know you will see that's the reason why God in every age he will set a standard for his people he had a Jeremiah he had a Isaiah he had a Danel down in Babylon he will always raise a man to be able to bring a word to his people in that given time to grab their attention because you see just like I said this is the earth and the and and and and the and the the the treasure Stones the the healing Stones The Peculiar stones are hidden in this earth and it's God that put it there praise the Lord amen at our birthday we don't go we don't go to the hospital and it take out uh you know uh uh uh our 10 years old legs and give us 15 years I mean 11 years old you know and says now I'm I'm now I'm a teenager I don't need this U you know I I need a teenager I'm they don't do it why it's in you it comes up with your as you grow up God place it in you once you were a child and and you played around as a child as you grow up and and and thinking about home and thinking about family I mean uh uh uh uh everything for you to be a father or a mother God already plac it in that is the PE h h h peculiar thing of the way that God made us that is the mystery of our life that's why the prophet of God says our natural birth is more mysterious why because it's peculiar that God will take 23 chromosomes from your mother 23 chromosomes from your diet bring you to bring it together to to form a unique character of yourself he said when I laugh I remember my mom I laugh just like when I stretch my head I just what my dad can do praise the Lord amen you see and that's the reason why the Bible asks us to do these things pray for one another James said confess your fault to one another praise the Lord amen amen confess your fault to one another what does it means sit down identify your failures talk about your struggles the Bible say one another confess your fault to one another there is not it's not a priest and somebody coming to confess to them no you sit down and you talk about it why because in doing that it gave us the opportunity to understand one another now because these things are shared when this person is dealing with this struggle I can be able to bear with them because I have an idea I didn't not have a vision I didn't read it from the Bible the person just told me I'm I'm sorry I I don't know I just have a fast hand I see things I just put it in my pocket praise the Lorden you know while if you have heard the story about you know these three great preachers that were that were good friends they they always meet and you know encourage one another and and and and all of that and you know and they were they were trying you know encouraging themselves to apply this scripture another guy you know was friend he says I I don't know I really need your prayers I'm I'm dealing with the spirit of lust and I I don't want to go into adultery that but I made my mind that the devil is just blasting my mind with all sorts of unclean thing then the other guy gained courage you see that's that's the way it happens you know because you know someone has laid their weakness on the table but now so the other guys you know he says he say yeah I mean I I don't have that problem you know my problem is just fiz I'm not I'm not doing well and you know um uh yeah sometimes I just I just take the church money I need help in that area praise the Lord the third guy he says well my only problem is Gossip I can't keep my mouth shut whatever I hear I tells praise the Lord am I think he had the most problem because these guys now afraid he going to tell their things out praise the Lord amen like Solomon said you know the word the word will bring healing it brings healing to our body just like I said this morning if there was not a heaven to go to this word can give you a decent life it can help you to raise a decent family it can give you life value praise the Lord am yeah because that's that is the reason why I mean the word is in such a confusion because it just looks like uh h h h there is nobody to trust this person is breaking this person heart deceiving this other person lying to this other person but what what it Solomon says here trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding it brings healing it help us to govern ourself it tells you that uh your your body your body is uh is uh is uh is uh is uh h a treasure house that God has put hidden treasure in E vessel that's what Paul said that's the thing that makes us peculiar with with all of our struggling and our weaknesses and everything there God God has designed Us in such a way that if we would just learn to trust him he's the one that made us he's the one that faction Us Praise the Lord we all want to be understood we don't take the time to understand the next person praise the Lord you see God said it in a way he said it in a way that uh none of us are born with our parents God did not throw us down from heaven we are all born with parents there's a union of a man and a woman that brought us here now God said it in a way that they that will be from that from that from that place from that stage will be where we will start having some identity of ourself because there will be there h h h h uh to to see how we cried and what we do uh in in a time where we are innocent and didn't have no knowledge of uh you know what we used to do what we used to eat how do we cross we don't have no idea but there were people that saw that that can tell you when you were little this is what you did you used to cry too much you don't want to believe it but they saw it amen you better believe them it will help you to start discovering yourself so God said it that way but you see in the way that he designed it there are things that you will know about yourself that there is no way you will know as long as you stay in that company so what will happen is that God also designed an institution where we go to learn whether it is school whether it is trade what whatever so we leave that home and we go out into another setting you realize that the teacher comes and tell tell the parent and says your boy is a smart board in the father now with what he have discovered of his son from the time the son had said no he said dummy why because he's limited he's only sticking with what he has discovered in that few period of time but the child is spending more time with this person this person is discovering some other things that the parent will not discover all this Gody is smart at me he's brilliant he's creative and then he comes to church he talks to the pastor as it talks Salone the pastor can see you he's a brilliant guy but under His Brilliant he's dealing with something there is something that is bothering him because the pastor can read his body language so the pastor now has discovered something that the teacher did not discover so I can I can talk to the teacher the teacher can tell me he's a smart girl man the board is very smart I mean on a Rheumatic mouth I mean he's just wow he's a Genus and in my mind as as a as a preacher I'm saying wow oh God can you just help him to Chanel that smartness to deal with his habits that smartness can you just Channel it in a way where he can be able to De because The Habit is creating complex for him praise the Lord then he go and find a girl now he know himself from from uh from from from uh uh uh uh child who what the parents said about him he knew what the teacher said he's a smart guy he's a brilliant guy I he get a in all of his then he remember also what the teacher said I mean what the preacher said now he goes into another state all of these are are stages of relationship in every stage of relationship we discover that's the reason why in I mean I mean in in the church it's not it's not is not governed in a way where that I mean we we we try to keep people by position no as a preacher as the Holy Spirit we we we sit right there we sit on we we try to watch for the gifts that are in the people how they can Ser praise the Lord so we don't want look at your attendance in church we look at how you live out out of church also because you might have one life out there and then when you come here I mean you are you are the guy on top of the roof praise the Lord you are the you are the God on top of the roof I mean you blowing the roof off I didn't know what you took this morning but there are there are there are all stages of relationship and in all of those stages of relationship there are things that we are discovering there are things that we are discovering of ourself that we never knew when a person comes to the place and say I know myself I can never do that there a language of deny it's a language of deny the person is building a defense and if you check close there is more than that I know myself I can never do that so if if if a person says that what is happening here is two things that is happening now you have to bring the conversation convince the person because they are either misunderstanding you or there is something about yourself that you you have not discovered yet so now I must I must convince you oh yeah you really saying there is it truth is that what I'm doing okay well I I don't know I think it was because uh yeah okay okay I remember now yeah I remember exactly what you are saying I think it was because uh uh yeah yeah you you are right you know I mean um I was I was I was not in a good mood and and but if you just I know myself I can never do that you're making that person more suspicious of you why because you're not helping them to understand you they are seeing something that that they are just discovered and what you doing is that they just took it off what you do is that you chunk it by and you close the F you just shut it off you're not going to be any better because what you're going to do now you just build defense in your mind I can never do that what what it think what what he think about me what you know you just go you just firing in your brain you just firing in your brain building defense so the god of the universe he set Institution institution from the day that we were born institution are set as we go along for us toover ourself for us to discover this peculiar treasure that we are this peculiar treasure that is hidden in us and I'm telling you that from the day that you were born things were discovered of you to the day that you die things will be discovered of you praise the Lord that's why they do op toxy why because they want to find out what kill him so from the day that you were born to the day you died things will be disc discover of you make it easy on yourself and join the learning process just make it easy on yourself and join the learning process let's have a conversation let's talk about it don't build walls and defense praise the Lord are we together let me read this as I try to find a place to close here I told you to understand me so I said find a place to close I never say I'm closing please understand because I mean we are always they always TR to you said you were closing you kept saying you were closing I said I'm finding the place praise the Lord see one of these one of these thing uh put Daniel 7 week up one of the thing that have created a a big Scandal around uh brother Brandon ministry right right on from the 70s see what he says here in uh uh Daniel's 7th week when he was talking about this seven seven Visions he says now I do not want anyone to go away misunderstanding this he said the tip is still playing I don't want anyone to misunderstand it don't misunderstand now and say brother brandham said Jesus will come in 1977 I never said no such a thing but if there is one one of the first scandle that people would bring about brother Brandon Ministry is that he said Jesus will come the world will end in 1977 and yet he's saying he's begging the people please don't go and misund and yet he still misunderstood praise the Lord amen sometimes we are making all the effort you are making every effort but you see misunderstanding sometimes will come from uh uh uh the state of a person's mind it would come from the state of a person the the person could have their mind in a setting State and then you say something for them to get out of that state of mind to be able to for understand what you are saying says why are you judging me is because they are in that state of mind they feel like theyve being judged that's how peculiar our entire being is you're trying to do your best trying to do your best you see because there is this place of our being our our spirit man you know where our our mind H that that inner man of ourself that we don't have control of I mean you can you can keep your hand in your pocket and says well I will just keep my hand I don't want him to say that I touch anything I would just keep my hands in my pocket you know I'm not going to move my hands there you know when they show the Cera they will see that my hands is in my pocket you know and you can do that but when it comes to the real of your memory your spirit your your spirit real I mean sometimes it's it's hard to keep memories coming back to your mind you really don't have control over it you try to shake your head but you keep you don't want to remember but it keeps coming back praise the Lord Isaiah said in in Isaiah 26 verse three that's that's a familiar scripture that's a very familiar scripture the prophet Isaiah says he you know uh speaking and God says I will keep in peace he says uh uh 26:3 th we keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in them praise the Lord even though you don't have control over those memories and and and over things that happen in your in your spirit realm but you see there's a promise here here where God is saying I will keep you in perfect peace they will come they will not bother you why because your mind is stayed on me amen and you are trusting me to deal with the situation am I don't have control over it they will come but him that keep his mind on the Lord has a promise that he will be kept in perfect peace and sometimes that's that's the way that's the place where people fail says well you know I I I really can't get it off my mind so I I I don't think I can continue I I really I don't I don't think I can continue we can we can't be friends because I can't get it off my you will never be able to get it off your mind cut that person from your life change your address move out of state go out of out of the country you will never leave it from your mind you can't take it away you can put your head in your brain and take out crazy things away but there's a promise here I will keep him in peace amen whose mind is still on me why because he's trusting me amen so even though the memory will come but if I keep my mind on the Lord if I trust him I'm not going to fall into depression I'm not going to fall into anxieties and all of that because I'm keeping my mind if I don't those things are enough to throw me into those things to make me anxious and just make me angry are we together amen dealing with misunderstanding is something that we cannot avoid so let's deal with it you cannot avoid to be misunderstood you will be Mish honest to how do you deal with it when people misunderstand you you can avoid it go in the room like the door don't come out Ask Door Dash to bring your food everything we will say Miss understand you he's spending all that time in the room because that that that guy he's I mean maybe he's drunk that's why he's not coming out in every everybody will get no I don't I don't think he's drunk no no I don't think he's drunk yeah maybe I I don't know yeah it's not normal that's that's not that's not his attitud you the way he's behaving is not normal something is going wrong with that guy so you can you can avoid it praise the Lord but you see the scripture gives us a provision trust in the Lord with all your heart leay that to your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge Him why because he formed you he formed you he design you are we together well to be contined musicians you can come find a place here to stop and then uh we will trust that the Lord will give us Grace to to get right back in the in the S of the G and uh are we together so you see there there are this things things that are required of us there are these things that the scripture required of us that the scripture encourag us to do why because it builds a healthy body it builds a healthy church when we love one another we prefer one another and don't judge one another and we uh admonish one another another we receive one another we greet one another we edify one another we bear one another burden forgiving one another consider one another uh to provoke to love and to good works that's that's what that's what the church is is is about that's what the body does this hand washed his hands the ear do the hearing for the entire body every part is is is set in a unique place and is is is supposed to be able to do uh H uh uh service the entire body the eyes do not see for itself if it see for itself it can't go anywhere because it needs the F to carry there but we get into that place and it's just us and ourself we're just so particular about ourself no Fellowship no no uh uh uh uh communion we must make effort to to edify to encourage find someone you are encouraging the Bible says uh I mean watch one another feet we had postpone communion here because of uh uh uh our changing weather and all of that but I mean you see those things you find people you you you just get so in your mind that you I mean uh you struggle to have the courage to ask you know a sister you know can can can can we wash feet you get your you get your feet washing partner and that feet washing partner until we go in the Rapture you and myself we have we are together that's not a healthy Church though we are all building our little clown our little tribe you know our little sweet group nobody else is in our cycle by doing that you setting yourself up fulfill you because the god of Heaven do not allow those things to exist it will be just for a while before you realize yes she used to be my good friend but now we can speak to one another what will [Music] happen and you realize it's just it's just all one another it said more in the sense of one another but it is it is it's in a cross way it's I'm doing for you and you doing for me I'm praying for you and you praying for me do we find someone to pray to pray for do we have a Praying list where you know you put this person name there I'm going to intercede of this on on uh you know for this person and and and and that's and that's and that's the thing let me close this thing because the more I keep it open there is just so much here to share the reason why the church is not involved in those things is is because a prayerless church is a powerless church we get so selfish in our prayer life that's the reason why we are not exploring those things because you see when you get from that humanistic realm of praying and you and and and you are you are able to swore up a little bit you forget about yourself you forget about your needs you forget about h h h h uh uh uh your burden the things that are bothering you you get in the place where you I mean you get so burden for for people but we we are we are becoming prayerless We are Becoming prayerless this microwave a we are we are microwaving our prayer to God it's just a fast Quick Service no waiting on the Lord you don't find people groaning groaning word they don't have words to utter they're just crying and and they just go by is just the Mercy Mercy and and they're just groaning in their SP you don't find [Music] it and we are not becoming conscious of that we all trying to be some kind of a a super special Believers when was the last time you wrote a testimony when was the last time you wrote a prayer request for somebody you are bured [Music] about with all of these prayer meetings that we've been having if we were really bringing h h h h uh burden and needs for people we spend more time in praying than even the time we have to preach [Music] and we cannot say we don't have need we cannot say there are things that we don't see that are that are concerning to [Music] us but sometimes the devil just put us in this place either we are we are embarrassed because uh you know people will know that we need this thing to be pray prayed about you don't want to put your name don't put your name there if you even write unspoken prayer [Music] requests like I said before that's not the right thing to do we we come here and and come to make prayer prayer service and then we start facturing prayer requests in our mind no we must come we must bring it we must bring burden we we we read about that Revelation chapter 5 under the altar there was a bow that was filled with the prayers of the [Music] Saints we don't come and say and just start making a prayer re oh let's let's pray let's pray let's pray for this nation let's pray for the uh and and then we just start facturing things in our mind it must be burden from the hearts of the people [Music] and when that is gone there is no way you can edify one another who will you edify for you to edify somebody encourage somebody it must be a concern for that person for you to provoke somebody it must be a concern for that person how can I get to know them how can I encourage them in my first start from greeting them and saying God bless you how are you going to be burden for them you don't even know the their name you never shook their hands you never say hi to [Music] them do you see how the how how selfishness is settling down in our spirit me and myself and we soon get crown with a religious spirit and that relay your spirit only Fe on the past it only Fe on the past I used to pray oh I used to be this are used to are used to what are we now [Music] of my [Music] soul Bread of Heaven feing till till I want no more yes my cup filled it up and make me [Music] whole oh fill my cup Lord I Lift It Up Lord come and quen this thirsting of my soul Bread

Bread of Heaven Fe me till I want no more yes my God fill it up and make me know you see the effect the effect of virtual uh uh realization virtual reality the effect of it is what it's doing is is is blinding us it's cutting us away from the people that are around us and we think that we are having fellowship and friends all around the world when the people close to us we are not with him I know you have to go to work we we have things to do but I mean you know most of the time I call my I call my friends on the phone and we talk and and I tell them it was a good time visiting with you on the phone because I can't go there to visit with them but I can visit with them on the phone we we can talk things and you know uh uh H uh just fellowship and and have half conversation there a brother there's a sister maybe you might have not seen them in church for the while didn't it cross your mind to say well I've not seen this sister for the while what's I mean what's going on with her let me check on [Music] her well let me just call this other sister and visit with her a little bit on the phone what's up do you have some time I I I just wanted to visit with you on the phone let's just you know uh and and and talk even praying on the phone you can do it you can have prayer time on the phone you can have Fellowship on the [Music] phone but you see the people right around us the people in the same house with us it's almost looks like they do now [Music] this all is happening is that just that line that line of of of Fellowship that line of the line that must benefit you is being caught because that is the person that is close to you that is the person that will that will Rush right there when you drop and something happened to you it will be the first person but no I mean it's it's it's it's just almost like hello hello I mean there is just no real conversation no real half touch and laughter and things I mean that would just warm the home [Music] together we spend time watching people video and they are making money out of us watching their video they don't have your address to even send you down to even help you pay your bills pay your phone bill they don't even help you pay your phone bill but you you you make lot of money for them because you are just watching their post and watching what they are posting up there and you have people around you

misunderstood how do we deal with it how do the year deal with it little Samuel when God called him God was calling from the realm of vision little Samuel was in h uh uh a humanistic realm when God called him he misunderstood he went to Eli and God called again he misunder tood and sometimes it it bother us to repeat it for the second [Music] time make the effort labor on it make the effort because if you don't make the effort it's going to affect you make the [Music] effort God make the effort and he calls Samuel again Samuel misunderstood he went to Eli God make the effort again and say sam [Music] here sometimes we don't get it the first time sometimes we don't get it we are not designed that way to just get it directly when the word of God speak to our heart sometimes God is calling us out of our Creed and out of our traditions and organization and and and and and and denominations to himself we don't get [Music] it but he don't give up sometimes he will use things that we will understand he he will create a situation around our lives he will put us in a situation and we come to the place and says well yeah no I I I think I think I need to give my heart to the Lord oh I I think I thinking it's it's that's the way he calls because we are not designed to understand his voice the first [Music] time he had to attract Moses by the burning bush and then when he got his attention then he call out but because he was born a prophet he could pick up the voice of God immediately [Music] we're living in a Time the society where is just so easy to be [Music]
