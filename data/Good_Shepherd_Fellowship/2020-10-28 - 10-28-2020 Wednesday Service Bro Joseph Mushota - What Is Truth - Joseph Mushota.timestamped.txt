[47:50] of the lord jesus christ we said amen
[47:53] may be seated my small title this
[47:57] uh evening is what is truth
[48:02] very short if you notice in the
[48:06] scripture
[48:08] did jesus didn't answer that question
[48:12] they asked him what is truth
[48:16] jesus didn't answer that question
[48:19] because it was
[48:20] the truth the tutor
[48:24] can't testify about itself
[48:28] the truth testified in a person
[48:33] when someone said we have the truth
[48:37] this church said we've got the truth
[48:39] that just said our come to us we are
[48:41] going to heaven
[48:42] near our church everybody they can say
[48:45] to come to our church
[48:46] but the truth doesn't ever change
[48:51] the truth is a person walking
[48:54] that's why this message and time
[48:58] message those people they are trying
[49:02] to correct the prophet to
[49:05] to judge quotations and
[49:08] and to start to judge the cloud it was a
[49:11] smoke
[49:12] all those things they are late
[49:16] because the message now is becoming a
[49:20] person
[49:20] walking hallelujah clapton for the lord
[49:24] amen let us clap for the lord praise the
[49:27] lord
[49:27] don't sleep don't sleep on me come on
[49:29] come on church
[49:30] praise god they are late
[49:35] because the message it's the person
[49:38] there are people
[49:39] walking now the message came to make
[49:42] us god the children of dogs
[49:46] are dogs the children of serpent are
[49:48] serpent and the children of god
[49:50] are god praise
[49:54] god that's why paul said
[49:58] ah and yet let's just forget about the
[50:01] to lay the end of the sea contours are
[50:04] good but
[50:05] let us go on to perfection as your
[50:08] father is
[50:10] perfect so it's possible for
[50:13] us to be perfect in freddy's
[50:16] perfection hallelujah praise the lord
[50:21] glory be to god praise
[50:24] god what is truth
[50:27] can i have number one please sister
[50:30] number one
[50:31] uh let us go there
[50:36] now he is i don't want to hurt you
[50:41] don't want to shake you object hide from
[50:45] you
[50:45] but i wish to preach the truth there is
[50:49] one things about it brother
[50:53] the truth we never make you popular
[50:56] but the truth will make you honest
[51:00] that's one good thing and doesn't you
[51:02] rather be
[51:03] honest than be popular certainly you
[51:06] had amen
[51:10] that's the truth will you take you
[51:13] will help you to be honest
[51:16] that's why in the message we don't want
[51:19] to be popular
[51:21] we want to be honest and
[51:24] and the majority is not a full
[51:28] of people or a thousand majority is the
[51:31] holy spirit
[51:34] a one person with the holy spirit is a
[51:37] majority than
[51:38] hundred people those that don't have the
[51:41] holy
[51:41] spirit that's why babraham said
[51:45] bring your family or children to the
[51:48] church
[51:49] where the holy spirit is controlling the
[51:52] church
[51:53] it's not because of joseph speaking good
[51:56] english
[51:57] and the french whatever no ways it's
[52:00] because of the holy spirit because it's
[52:02] only the holy spirit
[52:04] will help us to understand
[52:07] god to come close to god and to change
[52:11] the pig nature to the lamb
[52:13] nature and to be ready to be
[52:16] perfected hallelujah and go to the
[52:19] rapture praise
[52:20] god amen what is truth
[52:24] this is like in heaven number two i just
[52:28] put
[52:28] if we don't finish it okay we just go
[52:30] the way the spirit today i just want to
[52:32] read
[52:34] now i want you to know that
[52:37] when the phenomena was done miracles
[52:40] will perform the signs and wonders and
[52:43] when they went out
[52:44] the bible said the mexican magnitude
[52:46] went out it makes a group of people some
[52:49] of them
[52:50] believers some are pretending to believe
[52:53] the great mir the great miracle had been
[52:56] done
[52:56] people went out a professed believer and
[53:00] there was
[53:00] not believers
[53:04] can i go to the the third one please
[53:08] and that's where a great bunch of our
[53:11] trouble is
[53:12] we could put our finger on it
[53:16] is men and the who and the women who
[53:19] come into church and
[53:20] profess to be believers and they are not
[53:23] believers
[53:24] i found it in the pulpit i found it in a
[53:26] prayer line
[53:27] i found that in everywhere where men
[53:30] come in
[53:30] and women who said i'm a believer and
[53:33] profess to be a believer
[53:35] and they are not believers amen amen
[53:39] it's not a matter to say i'm a believer
[53:42] and you are a believer
[53:44] it's not to say i am a message believer
[53:47] it makes you already a message believer
[53:50] that's why jesus said if you read
[53:53] you hear the word you must put in a
[53:56] practice
[53:58] you hear you put in the practice you
[54:00] hear you put in the practice
[54:01] and when you put the practice it start
[54:03] to form you and
[54:04] to transform you and you start to be to
[54:07] fall in love with the world
[54:10] to fall in love with the world and the
[54:11] world will help you to change your
[54:14] nature because
[54:14] we came all of us upon the earth sinners
[54:22] i know one day i used to have one pasta
[54:24] that was wonderful the good pasta
[54:27] in south africa he used to underline too
[54:29] much since i was born
[54:31] i never committed that terry's i was
[54:34] just there
[54:34] i'm okay i'm fine that's
[54:38] one day i said you know it's fine but me
[54:41] i prefer a pasta indeed adultery is a
[54:44] smoke
[54:44] sinner and when jesus touch his heart
[54:47] and the feeling the holy spirit and the
[54:48] sleep change
[54:50] then you you have you were born perfect
[54:55] [Music]
[54:57] yeah you yeah if you feel like you're
[54:59] born perfect you don't need to come to
[55:00] church stay go to
[55:02] to heaven and there is no thing like
[55:04] that that's why
[55:06] branham said as a christian you must
[55:08] have the heart
[55:09] when a brother or sister fall baby laugh
[55:12] go and
[55:12] help him to stand up don't
[55:15] be there and debate biting and speaking
[55:18] wrong about her
[55:19] a good christian is to help your brother
[55:21] sister
[55:22] when he's down that's to show that
[55:24] you're a christian
[55:25] hallelujah praise god

[56:06] tool
[56:07] or some kind of a mechanical range to a
[56:10] great big religious
[56:12] regime that's right a christian is not
[56:14] some kind of tool
[56:16] that keep a religious organization
[56:18] moving
[56:19] a christian that is not a christian a
[56:21] christian is to be
[56:22] christ like a christian cannot be a
[56:26] christian until christ comes
[56:28] into the main the life of christ in him
[56:31] then he produces the life that the
[56:33] christ lives

[58:21] you've got to get a new baptism every
[58:23] day
[58:24] every day every day just keep going
[58:28] no any limit to it you try to say well
[58:31] now look a month ago i heard a wonderful
[58:33] experience
[58:34] that the testimony don't work what about
[58:37] now right right and i want you to notice
[58:41] there was some of it in there now god
[58:45] told moses to have an iron to go out and
[58:48] gather up
[58:49] some of it now he said there is
[58:52] going to last plump through your jain
[58:55] till you get into the millennium over
[58:58] yonder just exactly a type of
[59:00] holy ghost amen amen
[59:04] praise god now we are going just follow
[59:07] me
[59:08] care fully
[59:11] now we are we are taking a cave
[59:15] we need the baptism of the holy spirit
[59:18] every day every day every day right
[59:21] those are born again we need also
[59:24] refilling for every day every day and
[59:27] those are not
[59:28] born again they need also the baptism
[59:30] every day
[59:31] every day every day that's where there
[59:34] is a challenge and there is a problem
[59:36] sometimes you can hear someone was a
[59:38] pastor 40 years
[59:39] and they quit the puppy to say i never
[59:41] believe the message and you wonder
[59:45] you wonder how all these years was
[59:47] preaching
[59:48] so to that suddenly he said he never
[59:50] believed the message and the queen
[59:51] some brothers they were a good brother
[59:53] but after 10 years 15
[59:54] they backslid what's going on
[59:58] and when you hear those kind of things
[1:00:00] don't laugh it can also happen to you
[1:00:03] when you hear that one is the time you
[1:00:04] have to kneed down
[1:00:06] to make sure god i need that holy spirit
[1:00:09] at the right place glory be to god
[1:00:22] see let us go to the seven
[1:00:29] already good he said
[1:00:32] they that cannot stand uh testament
[1:00:35] are bastard children and not the
[1:00:38] children of god
[1:00:39] see they are worked up on the emotion
[1:00:42] see
[1:00:42] they see that i talked about a while ago
[1:00:47] that soul wasn't there to start with it
[1:00:50] was anointed
[1:00:51] with the spirit and and he done
[1:00:55] all kinds oh you the when your spirit's
[1:00:58] anointed
[1:00:59] you can it's the real genuine holy ghost
[1:01:03] and you could do still be a
[1:01:08] devil that's the prophet of the hour
[1:01:11] that's why
[1:01:11] us we know who we are worshiping we know
[1:01:15] where we're standing
[1:01:16] we are not like trying we will know
[1:01:18] exactly
[1:01:19] that's why when something happen it's in
[1:01:21] the message
[1:01:22] we have all the questions and the
[1:01:24] answers in the message we don't even
[1:01:25] need to read other books
[1:01:27] the message is a book you know me i
[1:01:29] don't separate the message and the
[1:01:31] the bible i always say this one book
[1:01:34] because brother branham preached the the
[1:01:37] bible didn't preach something
[1:01:38] and they always said even as angel told
[1:01:41] me
[1:01:42] i always bring it to the scripture
[1:01:45] if it doesn't fit kick it out
[1:01:48] you're listening out we don't need it
[1:01:54] so it's a revelation of the bible so
[1:01:57] where
[1:01:58] pentecost they don't understand as we
[1:02:00] understand
[1:02:02] so we don't have too much question so
[1:02:05] can you imagine
[1:02:06] a genuine holy spirit genuinely not
[1:02:09] another the same holy spirit
[1:02:11] can anointed if one the genuine holy
[1:02:14] spirit can
[1:02:15] anoint a sent one a child of god
[1:02:20] you see where there is a trouble so if
[1:02:23] you don't ever
[1:02:24] ego eyes you'll be troubled
[1:02:28] some people when they say that past four
[1:02:31] years me also can just go in the world
[1:02:32] that pastor can do that me also i can do
[1:02:34] that
[1:02:35] it means you and you never believe if
[1:02:38] you're a believer that's the time
[1:02:40] you must be more closer to god you know
[1:02:42] i love those
[1:02:43] shocking cuts when i read i don't
[1:02:45] understand it push me down my knees and
[1:02:47] cry
[1:02:48] i don't need to understand i need to
[1:02:50] believe this
[1:02:51] message was giving to believe it's not
[1:02:54] for you to understand you can't explain
[1:02:56] god except god himself entering your
[1:02:59] heart
[1:03:00] revealing who he is and you know who you
[1:03:03] are
[1:03:04] if god is not to you if he's not in you
[1:03:07] you can't
[1:03:08] know even who you are
[1:03:11] to stand the devil you've got experience
[1:03:13] of six years six hundred six thousand
[1:03:16] years you just now but you've got more
[1:03:18] experience than him when you know who
[1:03:20] you are
[1:03:21] you can tell him we created you
[1:03:24] yeah i was in his mind you know that day
[1:03:28] he asked job where were you job
[1:03:30] hallelujah
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:34] don't swallow the punch of the devil
[1:03:38] give him back taking things
[1:03:51] he talk more than god god always talk to
[1:03:54] us
[1:03:55] in a small voice sometimes we miss him
[1:03:58] we can pray
[1:03:59] we don't even have a time just to keep
[1:04:01] quiet together that's my voice
[1:04:03] as soon as he's finished to pray okay
[1:04:06] chantal
[1:04:06] let us go then let us pray
[1:04:10] we pray today okay let us go down keep
[1:04:12] quiet every time
[1:04:14] quiet time he will always talk to you
[1:04:18] and when you talk to you you can feel a
[1:04:19] sweet anointing
[1:04:21] sweet voice you feel like you can't
[1:04:24] explain yes tears come down hallelujah
[1:04:27] glory be to god praise the lord
[1:04:32] eight one
[1:04:40] the choice of your conduct good
[1:04:44] you could you can't mix it now
[1:04:47] you either for god or against god and
[1:04:50] the outward expression
[1:04:51] show exactly what on the inside see
[1:04:54] they cook about many of you think i got
[1:04:57] the baptism
[1:04:58] of the holy ghost i'm going to heaven
[1:05:01] that don't mean one thing that you're
[1:05:04] going to heaven
[1:05:05] no sir you can have the baptism of the
[1:05:08] holy ghost
[1:05:09] every hour in your life and still be
[1:05:11] lost and to go to hell
[1:05:13] the bible said so that's exactly right
[1:05:16] god blend for the lord
[1:05:17] praise god
[1:05:24] praise god so you're asking joseph
[1:05:28] where are you taking us i'm taking you
[1:05:30] to the seal
[1:05:32] praise god baptism and they still
[1:05:36] are not the same i'm taking you to the
[1:05:39] cell
[1:05:40] let me just jump first to go there we
[1:05:42] can come back
[1:05:46] you know the word of god are sweet
[1:05:49] only things you have to do just to drop
[1:05:51] down your guts
[1:05:53] even if ask preacher you can have
[1:05:54] quotations i ever ang where i master
[1:05:57] brother on whatever is angry master
[1:05:59] every preacher i've got his anger is
[1:06:01] master that's why we need to fight for
[1:06:03] ministry
[1:06:05] sometimes you can read the bible when
[1:06:06] the preacher's preaching is like you
[1:06:07] never read that scripture before
[1:06:10] it's it's good that's why you you need
[1:06:12] just to empty
[1:06:13] to let god speak to you when you have
[1:06:17] already ideas so you want to find the
[1:06:19] fault is a lot of faults you're going to
[1:06:21] find
[1:06:22] there is a two spirit come on it's
[1:06:23] because us we are so
[1:06:25] used to this canal
[1:06:30] life flesh we forget that we are the
[1:06:33] spiritual people
[1:06:35] we are not physical we are not cannon
[1:06:37] and that spiritual are strong are they
[1:06:40] that's the reality
[1:06:41] of you brother one is not this one you
[1:06:44] see brother one is
[1:06:45] 20 years inside that's him it's not this
[1:06:49] just as soon as you go if you ask can
[1:06:52] you come back
[1:06:53] i'm not coming back it's like a baby
[1:06:57] when is in the two in the in the tomb it
[1:07:00] can be there
[1:07:01] they say go ah you know when you just
[1:07:03] born you have that fear nature
[1:07:05] natural fear when they just think
[1:07:09] that baby was born with fear from
[1:07:12] contact
[1:07:13] of two to sex we came sinners
[1:07:17] so when the baby can you see the light
[1:07:20] the moon and you ask the baby can you go
[1:07:22] back to the home
[1:07:24] color nice that's that's that's a
[1:07:26] question they're doing the same thing
[1:07:29] in when it's heaven it's beautiful seed
[1:07:31] of glory is beautiful we just sing
[1:07:33] when you say death it's just a bridge
[1:07:35] he's a bridge when he's coming
[1:07:37] god i don't want to go
[1:07:40] because you don't know where you're
[1:07:42] going
[1:07:43] remember hope when she was already there
[1:07:47] under and brother banham called her
[1:07:50] and he said promise me are going to
[1:07:53] marry
[1:07:54] who can say that sister can say they are
[1:07:57] going to marry
[1:07:59] this is another dimension that's why
[1:08:01] it's beautiful more than the world he
[1:08:03] said i
[1:08:03] can't come back that is nonsense
[1:08:07] so this life and this message are
[1:08:10] spiritual
[1:08:12] now when we put in the physical that's
[1:08:15] why we have a problem
[1:08:16] when me every at work when is my
[1:08:19] supervisor
[1:08:20] they give me trouble i just it's not him
[1:08:23] the devil already in my enemy
[1:08:26] i went in the corner i pray i don't have
[1:08:28] a problem because i'm a
[1:08:30] i'm an ego i must master all the people
[1:08:34] you can create when they say you are
[1:08:35] created you can create atmosphere
[1:08:39] maybe sometimes i start singing praise
[1:08:41] god
[1:08:43] christian
[1:08:48] praise god they are great atmosphere
[1:08:51] they laugh
[1:08:52] and that problem is saying you know i
[1:08:53] don't just don't follow him you know
[1:08:55] today is not a good one
[1:08:57] let us come come help me here you create
[1:09:00] that atmosphere it's
[1:09:02] home you create atmosphere at school you
[1:09:05] it you you can
[1:09:06] it's because you don't want to do it
[1:09:09] you can i do it i'm i'm not preaching
[1:09:12] because of no
[1:09:13] i'm trying my experience we have more
[1:09:15] powerful people upon the earth i'm
[1:09:17] telling you
[1:09:19] well more powerful people i always tell

[1:09:38] god can protect the aeroplane because of
[1:09:41] you all the aurora plan

[1:13:36] hour
[1:13:37] any minute go to hell you can have that
[1:13:39] anointing they're genuine
[1:13:41] and you stoop the devil all those things
[1:13:42] to me you can't be
[1:13:44] questioned when you see someone 10 years
[1:13:46] or 30 and they quit he never believed he
[1:13:48] never believed the message he confessed
[1:13:50] he obeyed that scripture next time i'll
[1:13:52] give you babanam said are you obeying
[1:13:54] the messenger or are you believing the
[1:13:56] message
[1:13:59] some people they obey the messenger they
[1:14:02] have that
[1:14:02] love but they don't they mix their
[1:14:06] way of life with the word of god they
[1:14:08] become
[1:14:09] halfway christian hallelujah and
[1:14:12] god doesn't want them to be halfway
[1:14:17] but them they mixed with their lives
[1:14:21] i love i love to read sister nine please
[1:14:24] because when i say this at this point
[1:14:26] they always this they always talk
[1:14:28] things speeches these young creatures
[1:14:31] i love to read the prophet because
[1:14:35] we are living the very very dangerous
[1:14:37] time
[1:14:38] right now the devil is behind the puppet
[1:14:42] the devil is in the major the devil is
[1:14:45] preaching they've got more money than us
[1:14:48] they can
[1:14:48] preach they've got anointing when
[1:14:51] they're preaching the
[1:14:52] the building can shake more than the
[1:14:54] genuine one
[1:14:55] that's why we are living this time is a
[1:14:57] matthew 24 24
[1:14:59] and when we are listening to them be
[1:15:01] careful when you have a straight
[1:15:04] you don't have a powerful spirit they
[1:15:06] can take you to reason
[1:15:08] they can disturb you don't listen to
[1:15:10] them
[1:15:13] don't listen to me sometimes they start
[1:15:15] nonsense
[1:15:16] nonsense hallelujah this one yeah yeah
[1:15:19] i don't have to listen to waste my time
[1:15:21] you can't convince because
[1:15:23] even faith is a revelation
[1:15:27] upon this rock that's the church the
[1:15:31] church is about
[1:15:32] revelation when god revealed to you you
[1:15:34] don't need to go and force someone
[1:15:36] to be revealed god is going to reveal
[1:15:38] today today you're going to see like me
[1:15:40] today no it doesn't work that way
[1:15:43] god you just pray for him love him
[1:15:46] you don't know your attitude it can help
[1:15:49] somebody to come and
[1:15:50] visit you in the church
[1:15:55] there is one one chinese god forgive me
[1:15:58] a church there
[1:15:59] he called me one day you are different
[1:16:02] that's me i don't know
[1:16:03] i'm like yeah you guys you are very
[1:16:06] different
[1:16:07] and he started to approach me today he
[1:16:09] wanted to come but if god
[1:16:11] can you i was god forgive because i was
[1:16:13] looking down upon him because
[1:16:15] most of in chinese they don't even
[1:16:16] respect the christians
[1:16:18] so most of the idolatrous so for me this
[1:16:21] chinese maybe
[1:16:22] this is one of them it's different
[1:16:25] he said when people they they
[1:16:28] they try to do something wrong to you
[1:16:30] but the way you master them
[1:16:31] the way you continue to love i don't
[1:16:33] understand i call him
[1:16:35] i said i've got a super power
[1:16:41] oh yeah go leave me to god
[1:16:45] i know one day i spoke with my wife i
[1:16:48] told you right he said your husband is
[1:16:50] i'm not preaching stories that's why i
[1:16:53] always said
[1:16:55] uh babam said don't tell people to do
[1:16:58] things if you can't do
[1:16:59] it that's why i suffered a lot you know
[1:17:02] as a pastor let me just sit
[1:17:04] and sing sometimes it's okay it's okay
[1:17:07] let's
[1:17:07] say you i enjoy hear others preaching i
[1:17:11] hear
[1:17:11] the anointing i'm doing a lot of

[1:21:01] dizzy pastor the brother of the holy
[1:21:04] spirit
[1:21:06] you said i said no i was thinking i said
[1:21:08] no no
[1:21:09] no you said he has the holy spirit now
[1:21:12] he messed up the life of his own
[1:21:14] daughter
[1:21:15] she he said no no i can't dream my door
[1:21:17] a day i said we have a scripture to take
[1:21:19] care of from the marriage
[1:21:21] because there is no scripture from the
[1:21:22] marriage because he's a witch there is
[1:21:24] no scripture he must stay there and
[1:21:26] die
[1:21:28] yeah we must have a scripture to to use
[1:21:32] and if she come out by herself she must
[1:21:34] stay there until she dies she can't get
[1:21:36] married
[1:21:38] ah yes but if she come out he will never
[1:21:40] get married let's go you
[1:21:42] sister you you're gonna stay there until
[1:21:44] rapture
[1:21:45] is coming soon and if it's 30 years are
[1:21:48] you sure
[1:21:50] so that's that's the level of sometimes
[1:21:54] some churches and the preachers so the
[1:21:57] when we reach marriage case i always
[1:22:00] advise young people
[1:22:02] you must be sincere enough
[1:22:05] marriage is something you can't play
[1:22:06] with it because you can reach a level
[1:22:08] where we can't help you to come out
[1:22:11] sister eunice we cry for you but you
[1:22:14] can't come out
[1:22:17] nothing we can't help you
[1:22:20] that's why before you enter in make
[1:22:24] sure god is in it
[1:22:27] said some they didn't marry their wives
[1:22:29] but we can't fix it
[1:22:30] here we're gonna fix it in heaven and
[1:22:32] even there is no marriage just tell you
[1:22:34] you you're supposed to marry that one
[1:22:35] that one but here there is no marriage
[1:22:39] so the message of the hour it's a
[1:22:41] wonderful message
[1:22:43] it teaches for everything you just be
[1:22:45] honest i always tell people
[1:22:47] when you have bananas rotten bananas
[1:22:50] if you want a good bananas draw face the
[1:22:52] rotten be empty
[1:22:55] and look for the good bananas not you're
[1:22:57] playing game you go to boyfriend
[1:22:59] girlfriend and you want to just to
[1:23:01] change it from a boyfriend to the good
[1:23:03] husband or good man
[1:23:04] it doesn't work that way you must step
[1:23:07] away you clean yourself
[1:23:09] you wait seven years up to god ten years
[1:23:12] up to god
[1:23:13] i believe god there is one sister in
[1:23:15] mozambique
[1:23:17] he was in the church she was a white she
[1:23:19] said i'm going to wait my my
[1:23:22] my husband is coming she was there
[1:23:25] sitting there oh the brother said are
[1:23:27] you sure one day one preacher from
[1:23:29] europe kind of preached
[1:23:30] he said god tell me i must marry her and
[1:23:32] they got married
[1:23:34] don't help god put to god just challenge
[1:23:38] him you must reach in that and then the
[1:23:41] level what you said
[1:23:42] is death and the life just like his holy
[1:23:45] spirit
