[55:34] it's in Luke Chapter 2
[55:37] I want to take a little thought here for
[55:40] a Christmas message if we want to call
[55:43] it a Christmas message
[55:45] we know Christmas to the believer is is
[55:47] worship amen
[55:49] praise the Lord and I go into all of the
[55:52] the hidden things that are produced
[55:55] around Christmas we already know it's
[55:57] not Christmas or Christmas in the Bible
[56:00] we know all of that we know the history
[56:01] but yet we will say Merry Christmas to
[56:04] you amen
[56:06] praise the Lord
[56:09] so say Luke Chapter 2 let's read from
[56:12] verse 8.
[56:15] and they were in the same country
[56:19] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[56:22] watch over their floor
[56:24] and Lord the angel of the Lord came
[56:29] upon them and the glory of the Lord
[56:31] Shone around about them and they were so
[56:35] afraid
[56:36] and the angel said unto them feared
[56:40] for behold I bring you
[56:43] Good Tidings of great joy
[56:46] we shall be to all people are you part
[56:50] of those people this morning amen
[56:54] For unto you is Born This Day in the
[56:57] city of David a savior
[57:00] which is Christ the lord
[57:05] and this shall be assigned unto you now
[57:08] the angel is speaking to the Shepherds
[57:10] on the field the angel never went to the
[57:13] priest in the temple the angel never
[57:15] went to Herald the angel is speaking to
[57:18] those Shepherds that are on the field
[57:24] and they shall be assigned unto you ye
[57:26] shall find the Babe wrapped in sweating
[57:29] cloth line in the manger
[57:32] and and suddenly there was wave the
[57:37] angel and multitude of heavenly host
[57:39] praising God
[57:42] and and saying glory to God in the
[57:45] highest
[57:46] and on Earth peace Good Will tow us men
[57:51] and it came to pass as the Angels were
[57:56] gone away from them into heaven the
[57:58] Shepherds said one to another let us now
[58:02] go
[58:04] even onto Bethlehem and see
[58:09] this thing
[58:12] which is come to pass
[58:15] which the Lord have made known unto us
[58:18] I'm reading him something going through
[58:21] my mind that's what I'm kind of for
[58:22] stuttering and they came in in his and
[58:26] found married and Joseph and the baby
[58:28] lion in the manger and when they have
[58:31] seen
[58:32] a they may known abroad the saying which
[58:37] was told them concerning this child
[58:40] and all they that heard a wander at
[58:44] those things which were told them by the
[58:48] shipper
[58:50] but Mary
[58:52] kept these things
[58:54] and she pondered them in her heart
[58:56] that's why we were singing that chorus
[58:58] as I was thinking about the scripture
[59:01] that song keep playing through my mind
[59:02] and I was hoping that I get it right
[59:05] this time amen
[59:10] but Mary kept those uh all these things
[59:14] and she pondered them
[59:16] in her heart
[59:18] praise the Lord
[59:20] why did she pondered him
[59:24] why did she Ponder are the things that
[59:28] the Shepherds were saying because those
[59:30] were the very same thing that the angel
[59:32] told her
[59:35] the Bible says when the angel said it
[59:39] all those that heard it they wandered it
[59:43] was strange to them but to Mary
[59:47] it was
[59:49] like a Vindication it was like a re-eco
[59:53] so she pondered had those things
[59:56] let us pray Heavenly Father
[59:59] Lord Jesus
[1:00:02] it was just not a song this morning Lord
[1:00:04] but if it was our confession
[1:00:07] the word could be born and married
[1:00:10] thou word that the angel said a virgin
[1:00:13] shall conceive unto us a child is born
[1:00:17] and unto us the son is giving
[1:00:21] father thou word Lord
[1:00:24] was birthed by Mary and there's a word
[1:00:27] that is promised to this age of God
[1:00:30] the father is going to be a bride
[1:00:33] Lord there's a word that is promised to
[1:00:35] this age that there's going to be a
[1:00:38] rapture
[1:00:39] father there is there's a word that is
[1:00:42] promised to this age Lord that this is
[1:00:44] the age of the manifestation of the sons
[1:00:47] and the daughters of God if that word
[1:00:50] concerning
[1:00:51] the the Virgin giving birth could be
[1:00:55] born in Mary Lord father we certainly
[1:00:58] believe Lord that the promises for this
[1:01:00] day can be birthed through US Lord oh
[1:01:04] God we are not father going to bring
[1:01:07] Lord a baby in the manger we are going
[1:01:10] to bring a mentor Christ

[1:01:21] father we pray that God you will bless
[1:01:24] us this morning
[1:01:25] I would just want to pray for
[1:01:27] strengthening and just pray that God you
[1:01:30] will just help me this morning Father in
[1:01:33] the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen
[1:01:36] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[1:01:39] your seed
[1:01:40] while you sit there and follow the word
[1:01:42] be be praying for me and uh
[1:01:48] I need I need a little help this morning
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:55] I need the Lord help
[1:02:00] praise the Lord
[1:02:03] it's easy to
[1:02:04] slip away from from preaching and just
[1:02:07] get into teaching this morning but I'm
[1:02:09] hoping that to keep you long
[1:02:11] because I can't stand very long amen
[1:02:16] praise the Lord
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:20] let me read something here from the
[1:02:22] message unveiling of God
[1:02:27] let me read something from the message
[1:02:29] unveiling of God but before we do that
[1:02:32] let's go to the Book of Matthew
[1:02:41] let's go to the Book of Matthew oh I I
[1:02:43] will allow you to read it I would allow
[1:02:45] you to get back home and read it
[1:02:49] um
[1:02:53] really need your help Lord
[1:02:58] but what I wanted to read what I wanted
[1:03:00] to point you back to Matthew is there
[1:03:02] too
[1:03:03] uh the Shepherds got to see
[1:03:08] the Lord Jesus before the wise man
[1:03:14] praise the Lord
[1:03:15] because the very night there the Lord
[1:03:19] Jesus was born there was when the angel
[1:03:23] appeared unto the Shepherds
[1:03:25] that was the same time the wise men saw
[1:03:28] the star
[1:03:30] but it took the wise men two years
[1:03:34] to travel down
[1:03:36] to see the baby that's the reason why
[1:03:38] over in Matthew Herald had to kill
[1:03:41] children from two years or down
[1:03:45] because Hera was he was going off of uh
[1:03:50] what the wise men
[1:03:52] said to him
[1:03:56] when they saw the star they related
[1:03:58] everything so hero was was working on
[1:04:00] that information so when the wise man
[1:04:03] came Jesus was a little child
[1:04:07] when the Shepherds got there Jesus was a
[1:04:11] little baby
[1:04:14] praise the Lord
[1:04:16] so I just I just wanted to bring that to
[1:04:18] you so you uh we will we will realize
[1:04:21] that we're not we're not going to do it
[1:04:23] a whole lot on the manger we want to go
[1:04:25] in a different direction we want to talk
[1:04:27] to ourselves because just like I was I
[1:04:30] said we we also have a promise to be
[1:04:33] able to birth Christ in this day amen
[1:04:36] that is the purpose of the church now so
[1:04:39] let's let's take uh something here from
[1:04:41] uh on villain of God if uh if the the
[1:04:46] technicians are ready to put my
[1:04:58] praise the Lord now now uh Birdman
[1:05:02] preaching that message unveiling of God
[1:05:04] he said
[1:05:05] now my subject this morning I trust that
[1:05:09] God will reveal this
[1:05:12] and each time
[1:05:14] if you will take the tips and listing
[1:05:18] follow this now
[1:05:20] I hope and trust that
[1:05:24] you
[1:05:25] you have had a spiritual understanding
[1:05:28] of what God has been trying to get over
[1:05:32] to the church
[1:05:34] without saying it right out
[1:05:38] praise the Lord
[1:05:39] you mean that God can be saying
[1:05:42] something
[1:05:43] to you without saying it directly that's
[1:05:46] the reason why over and over in the
[1:05:48] Bible in the Book of Revelation he said
[1:05:50] he that has an ear
[1:05:52] let he hear what the spirit is saying to
[1:05:55] the church
[1:05:56] praise the Lord and I believe that God
[1:05:59] is now referring to our little two
[1:06:01] antenna on our hands
[1:06:03] I believe he's referring to uh uh being
[1:06:07] able to hear what
[1:06:10] is not set out
[1:06:13] literally
[1:06:16] praise the Lord Jesus said except
[1:06:20] you know except the people eat the Flesh
[1:06:23] of the son of man and drink his blood
[1:06:25] they have no life and and they'll
[1:06:28] stumble the people
[1:06:29] you know so it's it's all through the
[1:06:31] scripture you see how God speaks to
[1:06:34] Moses and he he will say things to Moses
[1:06:37] you know I want to make you a kingdom of
[1:06:39] priests you know what you are you you
[1:06:42] are a peculiar people to me and he's
[1:06:45] saying all of those things and yet he's
[1:06:47] asking the people if you would keep my
[1:06:49] Commandments and do those ordinances
[1:06:52] that I have given to you now so uh in in
[1:06:54] in in some way they could put a conflict
[1:06:57] in the in the mind of a reason or in the
[1:07:00] mind of someone with a kind of mind they
[1:07:02] would think that this they sound
[1:07:04] confusing God is saying one thing but we
[1:07:07] realize that like I've always said God
[1:07:10] language is what the spirit said his
[1:07:12] language is not English it's not French
[1:07:14] it's not German it's not Spanish amen
[1:07:18] so let's read this as we go ahead again
[1:07:22] and each one if you would take the tips
[1:07:25] and listing and I hope I trust that you
[1:07:28] will have a spiritual understanding of
[1:07:31] what that God has been trying to say it
[1:07:35] over to the church without saying it
[1:07:38] right out see it is it's a thing
[1:07:42] sometimes we have to say things in in
[1:07:46] such a way that it might thin down
[1:07:50] it might bring some to go out some to
[1:07:54] leave
[1:07:56] and some to ponder
[1:08:00] some to ponder over
[1:08:04] praise the Lord
[1:08:06] amen now I would think that it will be
[1:08:10] uh uh uh you know it would be
[1:08:14] uh not a good thing if if things are
[1:08:18] said purposely to make people to
[1:08:20] feedback
[1:08:21] but you see yeah uh truth
[1:08:25] you know truth is not defined by what we
[1:08:29] think truth is
[1:08:31] because truth is not only what a man
[1:08:34] said it's true truth Jesus make us
[1:08:37] realize that truth is a person
[1:08:40] I am the way the truth and the life amen
[1:08:44] praise the Lord
[1:08:46] so you see sometimes things are safe out
[1:08:49] of the scripture things I said sometimes
[1:08:52] God will say his truth I mean it was
[1:08:55] truth that God told Jeremiah that the
[1:08:58] people will be going into captivity for
[1:09:01] 70 years you see it's something that
[1:09:04] came back all the way from the book of
[1:09:06] uh uh numbers and when you study back
[1:09:09] there uh when God brought the people out
[1:09:11] of the land of Egypt he told them that
[1:09:14] assist this you can work in the seventh
[1:09:16] day you must rest praise the Lord he
[1:09:19] placed that also in the Lord of
[1:09:21] redemption there was a year called The
[1:09:23] Jubilee year where a person can can can
[1:09:26] give out their land and then because
[1:09:30] actually in Israel then we're not sold
[1:09:32] you know the land belongs to the Lord so
[1:09:35] if a person will lease the lane like we
[1:09:37] were saying and then at the time of the
[1:09:40] Jubilee the land will return back to its
[1:09:43] owner now so also we we see that God
[1:09:48] told the children of Israel they had
[1:09:50] their Harvest time I mean they are
[1:09:52] planting season and he told them that
[1:09:55] you can be able to sow the land you can
[1:09:59] tell the land you can work with the land
[1:10:01] but you must give the land a rest after
[1:10:04] every seven years
[1:10:06] but what happened was when the people
[1:10:08] came into the promised land they never
[1:10:11] did that
[1:10:12] they never gave the land its rest
[1:10:16] praise the Lord and let me tell you you
[1:10:19] have a land
[1:10:20] this body you must give it rest
[1:10:25] praise the Lord amen I'm not putting you
[1:10:29] on the seventh year or the seven day
[1:10:30] rest but I'm just I'm just trying to to
[1:10:33] grab your attention this morning Jesus
[1:10:35] said all you that labor and have the
[1:10:38] heavy lady come unto me
[1:10:41] and I will give you rest
[1:10:43] we know the rest of the believer is the
[1:10:45] Holy Ghost
[1:10:46] amen that is the rest that is the
[1:10:49] spiritual rest to the believer but
[1:10:51] beyond that our bodies need rest
[1:10:54] I would just throw that out there and
[1:10:56] then you figure it out
[1:10:58] so because the people never give the
[1:11:01] land rest for all of those years God was
[1:11:05] going to claim rest from them
[1:11:09] that was the actual purpose behind the
[1:11:12] 70 year
[1:11:14] captivity in Babylon
[1:11:17] God was going to claim the rest of the
[1:11:21] land from the people
[1:11:23] because the refuse
[1:11:26] to give the land its rest and now giving
[1:11:29] the land is rest it went into all
[1:11:32] different form of a dollar train and
[1:11:34] different things and uh you know uh
[1:11:37] putting their children through the fire
[1:11:39] and different things you read a book of
[1:11:41] Jeremiah you see the above the whole
[1:11:43] purpose of the Bible learning captivity
[1:11:46] was the the disobedient the breaking of
[1:11:49] God's Sabbath
[1:11:51] praise the Lord the breaking of God
[1:11:54] Sabbath
[1:11:58] so we see that here so uh uh Jeremiah
[1:12:02] was saying that and and zedekiah the
[1:12:05] rest of the other priests could not
[1:12:06] believe it how high can Jeremiah said
[1:12:09] that we will go into captivity for seven
[1:12:11] seventy years he says I mean that that's
[1:12:14] that's unbelievable we are God's people
[1:12:17] I mean what you are saying is not true I
[1:12:19] mean Jeremiah was put into praising he
[1:12:22] was weapon and all of those things so
[1:12:24] I'm only saying that to come right back
[1:12:27] to my thought here sometimes things I
[1:12:29] said
[1:12:31] from God
[1:12:33] Amen to team down the crowd you know to
[1:12:37] get people out and that's how Jesus was
[1:12:40] able to reduce his crowd when he says
[1:12:42] eat my flesh and drink my blood and
[1:12:44] people left and well sometimes things
[1:12:46] are said for us to ponder over
[1:12:50] because when you ponder over things
[1:12:53] it's a way it's it's a kind of a
[1:12:56] spiritual uh digestive way to be able to
[1:13:01] take things from your mind
[1:13:03] for it to resident in your heart
[1:13:08] praise the Lord because God's purpose of
[1:13:11] his word is not for us to keep it on our
[1:13:13] mind the mind is the is is the
[1:13:16] Battleground amen you want that word to
[1:13:19] resident in our heart
[1:13:21] we have to say things in such a way
[1:13:24] that it might tend down it might bring
[1:13:28] some to go out some to leave some to
[1:13:31] ponder over
[1:13:33] but that don't but that's don't
[1:13:36] purposely it must be done that way then
[1:13:41] it might be that
[1:13:43] there are some who say you mean God will
[1:13:47] purposely do a thing like that just like
[1:13:50] the Jeremiah example that I gave you in
[1:13:52] different example in the scripture you
[1:13:54] mean God will purposely that's the
[1:13:57] reason why the people could not easily
[1:13:59] believe Noah's message
[1:14:01] that God will destroy the word
[1:14:05] and only save you and your boat
[1:14:10] are you telling us that God will destroy
[1:14:13] the entire world only you
[1:14:16] and your animal on the boat
[1:14:19] how can you reason there out
[1:14:24] how can you reason it out
[1:14:29] praise the Lord
[1:14:32] now they might be gone
[1:14:34] there are some will say you mean that
[1:14:37] God will purposely do a thing like that
[1:14:39] he said in the day he does here today
[1:14:43] he said one day uh uh he had a thousand
[1:14:48] around him okay that gave that example
[1:14:50] except you eat my eat the Flesh of the
[1:14:53] son of man the Son of God the son of man
[1:14:55] who drink his blood you have no life in
[1:14:58] you
[1:15:00] so we we uh we want to take that little
[1:15:03] uh version in the in the in the in the
[1:15:07] in Luke Chapter 2 where we read verse
[1:15:10] 19.
[1:15:11] but Mary kept all of those things and
[1:15:14] she pondered them
[1:15:15] in her heart
[1:15:17] praise the Lord
[1:15:19] amen she pondered them in her heart and
[1:15:22] just like I said the reason why she
[1:15:25] pondered over those things
[1:15:28] is because
[1:15:31] all of those things that the Shepherds
[1:15:35] were saying were the very thing that
[1:15:38] they injure to her
[1:15:42] praise the Lord
[1:15:44] don't you feel good when you read the
[1:15:46] Bible and you see the law ministering
[1:15:48] something to you and then the Shepherd
[1:15:50] come and said
[1:15:52] the Shepherd come and saved from the
[1:15:54] back of the pocket
[1:15:56] it makes you to ponder law where you're
[1:15:59] in my kitchen
[1:16:00] were you in my bedroom listening to me
[1:16:02] praise the Lord that's exactly what was
[1:16:05] happening to Mary here amen
[1:16:08] and now you will realize that it was the
[1:16:11] same angel that spoke to Mary
[1:16:14] that was the same angel that spoke to
[1:16:17] those Shepherds
[1:16:19] it was the same angel that came down and
[1:16:22] spoke to Joseph
[1:16:24] woke him up and say Joe don't put this
[1:16:28] woman away
[1:16:29] what is happening to her is of the Holy
[1:16:31] Ghost
[1:16:32] it was the same angel
[1:16:35] that spoke to Zacharias
[1:16:37] praise the Lord
[1:16:39] amen
[1:16:41] so it was a season where the angel was
[1:16:44] in the neighborhood
[1:16:46] the angel was in the area he was he was
[1:16:49] visiting those people in the area uh you
[1:16:53] know visited uh
[1:16:57] um Zacharias concerning his wife
[1:16:59] Elizabeth and I I was thinking how to be
[1:17:04] able to make a transition talking about
[1:17:07] uh the subject we were talking about the
[1:17:11] Barons Rejoice into what we we will be
[1:17:14] talking about this morning so I'm really
[1:17:16] praying that the Lord will be able to
[1:17:17] help me amen
[1:17:19] and saw the angel visited the Zacharias
[1:17:23] and and make him to know that his wife
[1:17:26] was going to have a child that was the
[1:17:29] angel Gabriel
[1:17:31] that same injured was the angel that met
[1:17:34] uh uh uh Mary uh the well and uh and the
[1:17:40] angel told Mary
[1:17:42] you're cursing Elizabeth
[1:17:46] is also expecting a child
[1:17:49] now the angel did that for a reason
[1:17:53] because Elizabeth has passed the age
[1:17:59] of childbirth
[1:18:01] so now you have to remember now the
[1:18:03] angel told Mary that the Holy Ghost will
[1:18:07] overshadow you Mary said how would this
[1:18:10] thing happen what an interruption I
[1:18:12] don't know how many weeks or or it was
[1:18:15] to her wedding the angel comes right in
[1:18:17] there then interrupt the whole wedding
[1:18:19] plan and and Yaris says she's going to
[1:18:22] be a child and uh uh and the Holy Spirit
[1:18:26] I mean the angel is telling her that the
[1:18:28] Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you
[1:18:30] but the angel how to tell her that
[1:18:34] Elizabeth you're cursing is also
[1:18:37] expecting just to be able to to bring up
[1:18:41] her faith
[1:18:43] that she that was called barren
[1:18:47] amen
[1:18:49] she that was called Byron is also
[1:18:52] expecting so in in another sense the
[1:18:55] angel was trying to make Mary to realize
[1:18:58] that I'm not only dealing with you I'm
[1:19:00] also dealing with Elizabeth amen praise
[1:19:03] the Lord you are coming honor a promise
[1:19:05] but I'm also dealing with Elizabeth
[1:19:08] praise the Lord amen so we see that uh
[1:19:12] uh uh I mean it's just beautiful in the
[1:19:15] scripture
[1:19:16] it's beautiful in the scripture to see
[1:19:19] the ones that and here is it also that
[1:19:23] the angel visited uh uh this all uh
[1:19:27] priest in the temple
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:31] the angel visited him so you see there
[1:19:35] there was a small group of people and
[1:19:37] maybe about eight and I can count them
[1:19:40] with my finger there's there's John and
[1:19:43] Elizabeth John had a visitation
[1:19:46] Elizabeth had the experience of the
[1:19:48] child and uh married and Joseph and then
[1:19:53] Hannah and and uh
[1:19:56] uh
[1:19:57] Simon Simeon in the temple also were
[1:20:00] visited by the Holy Ghost because the
[1:20:02] Holy Ghost told him that you would not
[1:20:05] die
[1:20:06] until you see the law of Christ
[1:20:09] praise the Lord
[1:20:11] and uh and then also the shepherd so
[1:20:15] almost about uh seven or eight people
[1:20:18] there they had a small group of people
[1:20:20] now and this was a major thing that was
[1:20:24] happening in the world
[1:20:26] this was a junction of time
[1:20:31] this was a a a a a a breach in God's Own
[1:20:37] history
[1:20:40] but yet it was just a few
[1:20:43] few people
[1:20:46] the hardest experience
[1:20:49] and it was not just like uh you know
[1:20:52] they were convincing themselves they
[1:20:54] were telling themselves they actually
[1:20:55] had an experience
[1:21:02] praise the Lord when they have gone
[1:21:04] years and years and years with no uh uh
[1:21:09] no visitation just like it was in the
[1:21:11] time of Samia the Bible said there was
[1:21:13] no open vision
[1:21:16] do you know what it was to come out and
[1:21:19] say an angel told me
[1:21:25] an angel told me that my wife Elizabeth
[1:21:28] will have a child
[1:21:32] praise the Lord
[1:21:33] even even Zechariah struggle over
[1:21:37] accepting it then just say okay because
[1:21:39] you you can say Amen your mouth will be
[1:21:42] close until the child comes
[1:21:45] instead of you saying amen you can't say
[1:21:48] Amen to the word your mouth will be
[1:21:49] close
[1:21:50] because it was something that had never
[1:21:53] happened in history
[1:21:57] praise the Lord
[1:21:59] they have read it in the Bible
[1:22:03] I mean happy India time they have read
[1:22:05] it in the scripture
[1:22:07] like better bam said he had a lot of
[1:22:09] examples there he had the example of
[1:22:11] Sarah he had the example of Rachel he
[1:22:14] had all of those examples right there
[1:22:16] but because the word has just become a
[1:22:20] form
[1:22:21] they have just been saying it they have
[1:22:24] not had a physical experience
[1:22:28] they know that God is a provider but
[1:22:31] they have really never seen God putting
[1:22:34] a whole sack in their room when the
[1:22:36] window is locked and the door is like
[1:22:38] where did this bag pass from
[1:22:40] they have never seen it
[1:22:45] praise the Lord
[1:22:46] but it was a new day
[1:22:49] it was a new day it was it was uh it was
[1:22:51] at the junction of time when God when
[1:22:55] all that was in God's mind as a thought
[1:22:57] he was about to literally manifest it he
[1:23:01] was his word was going to be made flesh
[1:23:06] praise the Lord his word was going to be
[1:23:10] made flesh you have to remember when God
[1:23:14] said let us make man in our image
[1:23:20] and in
[1:23:21] our likeness
[1:23:24] praise the Lord
[1:23:28] I believe in my heart that was worth
[1:23:32] out of our problems started from
[1:23:35] because there was no creature that God
[1:23:37] expressed in making In His Image and in
[1:23:40] his likeness then when it came to men
[1:23:45] so we we realize here that go highest
[1:23:48] form of expression is to be made flesh
[1:23:52] they are his highest form of expression
[1:23:54] to be made flesh amen
[1:23:57] he revealed himself through His prophets
[1:23:59] God speak through dreams through visions
[1:24:02] and different things but it's his
[1:24:04] highest form of expression is to be made
[1:24:06] flesh and you ever said that God's word
[1:24:09] was going to be made flesh and a virgin
[1:24:13] was going to bring forth this body a
[1:24:16] body without prepare me that is also
[1:24:18] said in the psalm a body would they are
[1:24:21] prepared me in heaven is my Throne the
[1:24:23] Earth is my first two God says there is
[1:24:26] no place I can do Earth but there will
[1:24:28] be a body
[1:24:29] that will be prepared for me and I will
[1:24:32] step in that body now so all of this
[1:24:34] promise was coming to pass
[1:24:37] but yet they were just
[1:24:40] a few people
[1:24:44] just a few just a finger finger count
[1:24:47] not even 10 10 uh a person has
[1:24:52] had an experience
[1:24:55] or we can also count the wise men in
[1:24:59] praise the Lord
[1:25:02] but it was just few people on the face
[1:25:05] of the Earth that had an idea
[1:25:08] of this great thing that was going to
[1:25:10] happen
[1:25:12] so you can see here that's the reason
[1:25:14] why Mary pondered over it that's the
[1:25:17] reason why she stood there she listened
[1:25:20] to those uh
[1:25:22] uh Shepherds talking
[1:25:26] and it became comforting to her
[1:25:29] praise the Lord
[1:25:31] it became comforting to her that she's
[1:25:34] not deceived
[1:25:36] it was not just a bad dream or or a kind
[1:25:41] of for I I don't have a mental problem
[1:25:45] because the very thing that the angel
[1:25:47] told me
[1:25:48] is the same thing that these Shepherds
[1:25:51] are saying
[1:25:53] praise the Lord
[1:25:54] amen so as we will look into this
[1:25:57] subject this morning uh like I promised
[1:26:00] you to to be able to go fast I want to I
[1:26:03] want to go over to uh uh uh spoken word
[1:26:07] is the Original Seed we're a better
[1:26:09] Brandon taught us that uh actually we
[1:26:13] have two spiritual warm
[1:26:17] whenever the word is preached whenever
[1:26:20] God speaks to his people we have a womb
[1:26:24] of our mind that we first receive the
[1:26:26] word in
[1:26:28] the mind is a womb
[1:26:31] praise the Lord amen and and our heart
[1:26:35] also is a womb
[1:26:37] so he speaks here and he says spoken
[1:26:40] word is the Original Seed he says now
[1:26:44] the word that God speak to multiply and
[1:26:47] replenish the Earth listen to this now
[1:26:49] the word when God said he the Bible said
[1:26:53] he blessed man and says man must uh uh
[1:26:56] uh uh multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:27:00] according find a place to learn
[1:27:05] father that the word caught into the
[1:27:08] womb of a virgin
[1:27:11] because when God spoke that word and
[1:27:14] said man must multiply and replenish the
[1:27:17] Earth you have to realize that it was it
[1:27:20] was the spoken word of God
[1:27:23] praise the Lord
[1:27:25] amen so if if if if Adam and Eve who
[1:27:29] have just kept long believing God's word
[1:27:32] and moving you know in the power and
[1:27:34] authority they have definitely they were
[1:27:37] going to bring there will be a time
[1:27:38] where Adam was going to speak to his
[1:27:40] wife and says I want sons and daughters
[1:27:43] and she was going to bring it forth
[1:27:45] so that's why brother Branham is saying
[1:27:48] here when God said that that spoken word
[1:27:53] move on through the Earth
[1:27:57] amen for the spoken word of God to be
[1:28:01] able to produce life
[1:28:03] if for no place to land
[1:28:06] why because Genesis 3 came in
[1:28:10] amen
[1:28:12] Genesis 3 came in were the second uh uh
[1:28:16] you know uh deceived even and make her
[1:28:18] to believe that whatever God says you
[1:28:21] know what you know God is he speaks so
[1:28:23] deep uh uh uh and and right in there the
[1:28:26] you know the sex acts were allowed
[1:28:29] so it was it was that's that's the
[1:28:31] reason why it becomes a permissive wing
[1:28:34] and it's only blessed under the marriage
[1:28:36] covenant amen sex act is only blessed
[1:28:39] under the marriage covenant so we see
[1:28:41] here the Alberta Branham says that word
[1:28:44] is finally finally this were caught into
[1:28:48] a womb of a virgin
[1:28:50] a virgin is going to bring forth what
[1:28:53] God said unto us as son is born unto us
[1:28:57] a child is born a son is giving a a
[1:29:00] virgin that word is going to create life
[1:29:04] praise the Lord that word is going to
[1:29:07] create life so that's the reason why if
[1:29:10] Jesus said he that believeth in me will
[1:29:13] have eternal life it is not when we die
[1:29:16] before we have it that word that is
[1:29:18] spoken if you believe it you are a
[1:29:21] possessor of eternal life while you are
[1:29:24] in this body
[1:29:28] praise the Lord while you are in this
[1:29:30] bother you are a possessor of eternal
[1:29:33] life now when we die
[1:29:36] Hallelujah
[1:29:38] are we together
[1:29:41] now so
[1:29:43] the word caught into the womb of a
[1:29:46] virgin
[1:29:47] now he goes down he says now there is a
[1:29:51] womb of the physical
[1:29:55] there is a womb of the spirit
[1:30:00] praise the Lord did you believe that
[1:30:03] there is a spiritual warm and a physical
[1:30:07] form
[1:30:09] and the mind
[1:30:11] is a womb of the spirit
[1:30:15] Paul days with that in the Book of
[1:30:17] Romans
[1:30:18] he talks a whole lot in in their sins
[1:30:21] now so we see here that uh uh that's
[1:30:26] that's the place that we want to we want
[1:30:28] to travel because if we if we say you
[1:30:31] know if we confess that uh you know uh
[1:30:35] if the word could be born and married
[1:30:37] that same word can be born in us then we
[1:30:40] must have a womb to be able to receive
[1:30:43] the wording amen we must have a womb to
[1:30:46] be able to receive the word praise the
[1:30:48] Lord so that that is the thought that
[1:30:50] that we we we want to go through this
[1:30:53] morning
[1:30:54] praise the Lord now so we have a we have
[1:30:57] a we have a spiritual warm we have a
[1:31:00] physical warm there they are too warm we
[1:31:02] have the more the the womb of the mind
[1:31:04] and we have the womb of our soul amen
[1:31:10] he goes down he says the mind is a womb
[1:31:13] of the spirit what to
[1:31:16] to take in and let out
[1:31:20] that's how they they commit adultery now
[1:31:22] when brother Branham was dealing with
[1:31:24] this
[1:31:25] he went he went back to Genesis chapter
[1:31:27] three that let me let me let me let me
[1:31:30] just read a little bit and uh and be
[1:31:32] able to cap ourselves yeah that's how
[1:31:35] they committed they committed adultery
[1:31:38] uh let's let's set on Devil's Spirit
[1:31:42] Port then uh something against the word
[1:31:46] of God then she committed adulterate
[1:31:49] Satan
[1:31:50] hit Eve mine and in the womb of her mind
[1:31:57] she doubted God's word
[1:32:01] then comes the the actual art
[1:32:05] praise the Lord so what brother Branham
[1:32:08] is dealing with here is that the the the
[1:32:11] the the the the the the mind of the womb
[1:32:15] is very important
[1:32:17] that nothing can affect our body
[1:32:21] until that seed has been sown in our
[1:32:24] mind
[1:32:27] praise the Lord
[1:32:28] when he saw that seed uh uh in in Eve
[1:32:33] mind
[1:32:34] that you will be like God
[1:32:37] nor in Good and Evil
[1:32:40] praise the Lord
[1:32:42] when that seed was sold in her mind
[1:32:46] and like brother Branham says she
[1:32:48] stopped for the white and she reasoned
[1:32:50] on it
[1:32:51] it weakens the body
[1:32:54] right
[1:32:55] praise the Lord when seeds are sold in
[1:32:58] our mind and and our mind received those
[1:33:02] seeds then brother Brown says that's how
[1:33:04] our body now surrounded to the Arts
[1:33:08] whatever it is whether it is lie lost
[1:33:10] whatever it is
[1:33:14] so we realize here that the mind is a
[1:33:17] very powerful one
[1:33:20] and the only way that we can ever be
[1:33:24] born again
[1:33:26] is first in the womb of the Mind
[1:33:31] receive the word
[1:33:34] and then the spirit comes on top of that
[1:33:39] and bring it there you are
[1:33:42] praise the Lord amen so we see these two
[1:33:46] minds and and uh and uh and and and when
[1:33:49] when uh when the scripture says she
[1:33:52] ponder over those things she thought
[1:33:54] about it it was in her mind she was
[1:33:56] reflecting on listening to those uh
[1:34:00] Shepherd she was reflecting on what the
[1:34:03] angel said to her but you see what the
[1:34:05] angel said to her has already been
[1:34:08] resident in her heart because yeah she's
[1:34:11] experiencing a child she has already
[1:34:13] brought for the child the child is lying
[1:34:15] there
[1:34:17] but it's becoming more real to her
[1:34:21] she's rehearsing in her mind or
[1:34:23] reminding herself that this is what the
[1:34:26] angel said
[1:34:30] praise the Lord now so we see this that
[1:34:34] uh uh that the church the Bride of Jesus
[1:34:37] we are just like Mary in uh in in in
[1:34:41] this state we have a promise for our day
[1:34:44] praise the Lord
[1:34:45] what is that promise the son of man
[1:34:47] being revealed again
[1:34:50] that's the bride promise
[1:34:53] so the bride has a promise to be to to
[1:34:56] to birth Christ again
[1:35:00] but you see this time it's not going to
[1:35:02] be uh uh uh a ball that's separated from
[1:35:06] our body is going to be expressing
[1:35:08] breath in Christ through your body
[1:35:12] like Paul who says is no longer I that
[1:35:15] live
[1:35:16] but Christ that live any means amen so
[1:35:19] we're going to bring for Christ
[1:35:21] this is going to be a bride Christ in
[1:35:25] bright form
[1:35:27] but for us to to be able to get to that
[1:35:29] place you know for us to get to that
[1:35:32] place we will have to go through the
[1:35:35] same process of conception
[1:35:39] praise the Lord
[1:35:41] amen now that's the reason why we took
[1:35:44] the type to be able to talk about why
[1:35:47] God Through the Ages gave Abraham a
[1:35:50] promise but yet he hired his wife to be
[1:35:53] Barren for about 25 years give Isaac a
[1:35:57] promise and and yet Rebecca was was
[1:36:00] Byron and and and even Jacob a promise
[1:36:03] and all these Patriot their their wives
[1:36:06] had to go through through these things
[1:36:08] now you see this is God saying something
[1:36:10] without saying it out
[1:36:13] he's saying it because he allowing it to
[1:36:16] happen in the life of these women when
[1:36:19] he already told Abraham that Abraham
[1:36:21] will become the father of many nations
[1:36:24] but yet he allowed them to go through a
[1:36:28] a dry season allow them to go through a
[1:36:31] Barren period why God does that
[1:36:38] praise the Lord
[1:36:41] amen
[1:36:43] now Genesis chapter 3 the Bible says and
[1:36:46] God said unto the woman the seed of the
[1:36:48] woman there are seas shall bruise the
[1:36:50] head of the serpent
[1:36:54] and he shall bruise the heat God giving
[1:36:57] a woman here a promise of redemption
[1:37:00] that the woman will have a seed in the
[1:37:02] seed of the woman will become an
[1:37:04] overcomer the seed of the woman is going
[1:37:06] to turn history back again the seed of
[1:37:09] the woman is going to bring them back to
[1:37:11] that place where God wants a man to be
[1:37:15] but how many years how long did it took
[1:37:18] for this seed to come
[1:37:22] praise the Lord
[1:37:25] how long God how to raise a people
[1:37:29] called the Jews and give them the Lord
[1:37:32] and all of his ordinances just to
[1:37:35] prepare a bloodline because the Messiah
[1:37:37] would travel on that bloodline
[1:37:40] praise the Lord
[1:37:43] every every the uh uh uh Jewish Guild I
[1:37:48] was as I was studying last night I came
[1:37:49] across that I mean last week you know
[1:37:52] and and that's the reason why uh uh uh
[1:37:55] child birth was very important to this
[1:37:58] patriarch because they were all looking
[1:38:00] to that promise of the seed of the woman
[1:38:04] now but in their mind is uh they never
[1:38:08] taught it like the way it happened to
[1:38:10] Mary they just thought that maybe my
[1:38:12] child will be that one that will that
[1:38:14] will that would be the Messiah maybe my
[1:38:16] child you know so so Rick Richard there
[1:38:18] you know uh uh uh struggling with Jacob
[1:38:21] give me children Lisa died
[1:38:25] so every one of them was looking to that
[1:38:27] promise but see how many years it took
[1:38:31] you know how many years it took
[1:38:34] God promised to have a bride Paul says I
[1:38:37] expose you to Christ as a church virgin
[1:38:42] but God had to take his church through
[1:38:44] Seven Ages
[1:38:48] the messenger Paul came in a Ephesian
[1:38:51] Church age and he laid the foundation
[1:38:53] but the church had to go through seven
[1:38:56] Church ages and even went through a dark
[1:38:59] period
[1:39:04] praise the Lord
[1:39:08] amen I was I was studying and I came
[1:39:12] across something that was that was very
[1:39:14] very beautiful
[1:39:17] this is Christmas
[1:39:19] around the time where Jesus
[1:39:23] was born
[1:39:26] the the Jews
[1:39:30] they were at a place where
[1:39:41] they kept looking for This Promise were
[1:39:45] oh
[1:39:48] Jacob said the scepter
[1:39:52] will not leave
[1:39:54] Judah
[1:39:56] until shallow will come
[1:40:00] there was
[1:40:01] also a promise that they were looking
[1:40:05] to the Messiah
[1:40:07] so just in that time when Jesus was born
[1:40:13] they had a they had a lot of
[1:40:17] uh
[1:40:19] there was a lot of
[1:40:22] uh both with the sahindrance and uh the
[1:40:26] the sahindrance that made made of the
[1:40:29] Pharisees and the Sadducees and all the
[1:40:31] different groups that was there that was
[1:40:33] the name of the air on the World Council
[1:40:35] of churches or the Council of churches
[1:40:37] among the Jews now so uh they were
[1:40:40] coming to the conclusion
[1:40:42] that uh the Romans are now ruling over
[1:40:46] them
[1:40:47] but God has made a promise
[1:40:50] that the scripture was not going to
[1:40:52] leave Judah
[1:40:54] so which means God was always going to
[1:40:57] raise up a king from the time of David
[1:41:01] God Israel will always have a king but
[1:41:04] now Yara said that uh
[1:41:06] they they announced subjecting
[1:41:10] themselves to a Roman King Herod and and
[1:41:15] and there is no king in Israel
[1:41:19] praise the Lord
[1:41:20] so that was one of the reason why
[1:41:26] the struggle to believe Jesus as the
[1:41:30] Messiah
[1:41:32] because what they did not realize is
[1:41:36] that
[1:41:37] uh
[1:41:39] the
[1:41:40] the kingship
[1:41:43] that was coming through David down and
[1:41:46] Jesus in that lineage too that this
[1:41:50] their King was going to be the amaziah
[1:41:55] in their mind they separated
[1:41:58] the kingship which means they were going
[1:42:01] to have a king on the throne
[1:42:03] and during that time a king of Judah and
[1:42:06] that will be the same time the Messiah
[1:42:08] would come are you understanding me
[1:42:11] praise the Lord
[1:42:12] so how can we talk about a messiah how
[1:42:16] can we say that he is the Messiah when
[1:42:19] we don't have a king
[1:42:21] in Israel
[1:42:23] the scepter was taken from Judah so
[1:42:26] which means the prophecy that Jacob
[1:42:28] prophesied
[1:42:30] it's incomplete
[1:42:33] because the shelter will be in Judea
[1:42:37] there will always be a king on the
[1:42:39] throne
[1:42:42] praise the Lord when the Messiah comes
[1:42:45] so how can you say that this man is the
[1:42:48] Messiah and we have hero as our King
[1:42:54] it's broken in the scripture
[1:42:58] praise the Lord
[1:43:01] it's kind of a broken in the scripture
[1:43:03] but you see God's word
[1:43:08] will never fail
[1:43:10] now one of his world will be broken
[1:43:14] because just at the same time where the
[1:43:17] Messiah will be born because it's a
[1:43:20] fulfillment of scripture that is that is
[1:43:22] intertwined because here is the wise man
[1:43:25] here
[1:43:26] a true uh uh uh the vision the scene of
[1:43:30] the stars that they saw in that and you
[1:43:33] read on that brother Branham will always
[1:43:35] uh uh uh kind of for relate the Stars to
[1:43:38] the pillar of fire now so uh with that
[1:43:40] with the Stars that they saw this wise
[1:43:43] man is is seen a star that is
[1:43:46] identifying that a king is born
[1:43:49] amen this order this or the wise man is
[1:43:52] seeing the star that is that is
[1:43:55] identifying that uh you know uh there's
[1:43:58] there's a seven Bond there is there is
[1:44:00] one that is born and is going to give
[1:44:01] his life and and they came with those
[1:44:04] gifts to be able to identify so right in
[1:44:08] the gifts of the wise man
[1:44:12] the King was identified and the Messiah
[1:44:15] was also identified
[1:44:18] praise the Lord because I because uh
[1:44:21] because the the Jews believe that you
[1:44:24] tell them about the Isaiah 53 they will
[1:44:28] tell you that that should be the Messiah
[1:44:33] praise the Lord so in the wise man gift
[1:44:36] God was able to identify the king line
[1:44:40] in Judah and God was also able to
[1:44:43] identify his seven
[1:44:47] which is the Messiah but yerry is the
[1:44:50] whole sahindra's Council it was a very
[1:44:53] big rehistory it was a very big
[1:44:55] discussion
[1:44:57] that God has turned his back on us
[1:45:02] if not this word
[1:45:05] is broken
[1:45:06] because we are told that there will be a
[1:45:09] king
[1:45:12] there is no way we can prepare for the
[1:45:14] Messiah
[1:45:15] until there is a king
[1:45:20] praise the Lord
[1:45:22] amen now so you see that's the reason
[1:45:24] why they can they can they can put the
[1:45:26] promise up toward the Millennium in
[1:45:28] because the uh you know the son of David
[1:45:30] will be only strong they can put the
[1:45:32] promise up to that time because they
[1:45:35] believe that there also will be a time
[1:45:37] where they will have a king on the
[1:45:39] throne
[1:45:41] but God
[1:45:44] have his way to fulfill his word
[1:45:49] praise the Lord amen
[1:45:53] in one birth
[1:45:55] in one birth he's fulfilling both the
[1:45:58] king of Judah
[1:46:00] and he's giving them the amazing
[1:46:04] praise the Lord
[1:46:06] now so we see here that that is the same
[1:46:09] thing to the church
[1:46:11] we have a promise
[1:46:13] amen we have a promise of the
[1:46:16] manifestation of the sons of God we have
[1:46:19] a promise that we will be adopted we
[1:46:22] have a promise of the Holy Ghost now you
[1:46:25] see it's easy for you to look at the
[1:46:27] church and look at the things that is
[1:46:29] happening around the Church of men that
[1:46:31] have creeped in on a word according to
[1:46:33] the scripture they have brought
[1:46:35] different doctrines to build the
[1:46:37] accounts and and men that have gotten
[1:46:39] themselves for wealth and different
[1:46:41] things that is happening around the
[1:46:42] church and you and you look at it and
[1:46:44] you ask yourself is this Rapture thing
[1:46:46] even truth
[1:46:50] praise the Lord
[1:46:52] amen because you see the way the human
[1:46:55] mind works is the other uh uh uh you
[1:46:59] know uh we we expect to go from uh uh uh
[1:47:05] uh you know at Birth we go have our
[1:47:07] first birthday in our second birthday
[1:47:09] and you know we we never expect to skip
[1:47:13] a birthday
[1:47:15] praise the Lord
[1:47:17] you never hear the person say I have a
[1:47:19] promotion in my birthday I was two I was
[1:47:21] four years from now I'm six
[1:47:26] praise the lord we expect that but then
[1:47:29] also it's also out of place where you
[1:47:32] you can see the life of a young child
[1:47:34] and you you ask uh what is the age of
[1:47:37] the child is this or what the child
[1:47:39] she's she's 80 years old wow
[1:47:41] she behaved like 12.
[1:47:45] all she behaved to make sure for her age
[1:47:49] praise the Lord what what brings that
[1:47:52] experience is because you know what a
[1:47:55] nine year old should do you in your mind
[1:47:57] you know the way that a nine year old or
[1:47:59] the 10 year old should behave
[1:48:01] but now to to be able to associate the
[1:48:04] behavior of the child with the age about
[1:48:07] for you
[1:48:09] praise the Lord amen I'm coming to
[1:48:12] something insane there now so you see
[1:48:14] that uh uh when you when we look at all
[1:48:17] of the things that the church have gone
[1:48:19] through you even look into the ages
[1:48:21] let's leave laodisha for now but you
[1:48:23] look into the ages to just see how the
[1:48:26] church went through I mean a deadly
[1:48:28] persecution
[1:48:30] that was called The Dark Age
[1:48:33] praise the Lord a deadly persecution
[1:48:36] until the uh uh uh uh uh room Rose to
[1:48:42] the place word I mean the uh the church
[1:48:45] was controlling the word it was
[1:48:47] controlling the government you know
[1:48:48] every King had to had they had the pope
[1:48:52] ahead of them but yet in such a Time the
[1:48:56] promise of a bride was State truth the
[1:49:00] promise of a Rapture was State truth the
[1:49:03] promise of adoption was State truth but
[1:49:06] yet God allowed his church to go through
[1:49:09] all of that if you were living in such a
[1:49:12] time you see that's the reason why Paul
[1:49:14] wrote that letter to the to the the
[1:49:16] church in Thessalonian about the rapture
[1:49:20] the reason why because the testimony
[1:49:23] church was on a social persecution
[1:49:26] and some started to believe that the
[1:49:29] Rapture has already taken place
[1:49:32] so Paul had to write them and reassure
[1:49:34] them that that time will not happen
[1:49:37] until there be a man of sin
[1:49:41] if you read history the Thessalonian
[1:49:44] church has always been a persecuted
[1:49:45] Church
[1:49:48] praise the Lord
[1:49:49] you see so things happen what I'm trying
[1:49:52] to say is that things happen in our
[1:49:55] lives we get down to our dark period or
[1:49:58] we get down to our Long Point that there
[1:50:00] is no way you can be able to associate
[1:50:03] the promise of God
[1:50:06] and the things that are going on in your
[1:50:08] life
[1:50:09] you look at those things you say sir
[1:50:11] how can I be a child of God
[1:50:15] praise the Lord
[1:50:17] amen the age has gone through it time
[1:50:20] has gone through it but God's word never
[1:50:23] fails
[1:50:27] praise the Lord he said he was going to
[1:50:29] have a church and yet he has a church
[1:50:35] that's the reason why when when uh uh uh
[1:50:38] the greatest move of God has raised on
[1:50:41] the scene the church system will always
[1:50:43] want to believe that it must come true
[1:50:45] then
[1:50:48] that's why they want to come to this
[1:50:50] place of a World Council of churches
[1:50:52] because uh I mean every one of us must
[1:50:54] believe the same we are serving the same
[1:50:56] God
[1:50:58] everybody on the same level
[1:51:04] praise the Lord
[1:51:06] amen
[1:51:07] and I believe that was the same thing
[1:51:09] that was happening to Young Mary
[1:51:14] all my friends are getting married at
[1:51:16] 18.
[1:51:17] she has plenty out
[1:51:20] that she was going to
[1:51:22] by 18 years I hope I have someone to
[1:51:25] take my hand in marriage
[1:51:27] praise the Lord
[1:51:29] here come Joseph
[1:51:33] we know he was he was a bit older than
[1:51:35] her
[1:51:36] history proved that he had a wife his
[1:51:39] wife passed away
[1:51:41] so he had children
[1:51:43] you know but God how all of these things
[1:51:45] planned out because he knew the path
[1:51:48] that he had laid down for Mary's life
[1:51:53] so he needed the right person to be
[1:51:55] there
[1:51:57] to be able to support her in that
[1:52:00] difficult time
[1:52:02] praise the Lord Mary believe brother
[1:52:04] Branham would talk and says how Mary
[1:52:06] went to the well he says in my being
[1:52:09] after uh uh
[1:52:11] uh uh a service are the synagogues and
[1:52:13] she listening to the priests reading
[1:52:16] this very scripture
[1:52:19] you know you know you know the message
[1:52:20] he said Joseph she and Joseph might have
[1:52:23] been reading Isaiah 9.
[1:52:26] about a virgin shall conceive
[1:52:30] and they are talking how could that be
[1:52:34] now so you see
[1:52:36] this whole thing about pondering over
[1:52:38] the word Mary started even before she
[1:52:41] she got an experience of what the
[1:52:44] shepherd was saying she was thinking how
[1:52:46] would this be
[1:52:48] how will a virgin
[1:52:53] be conceived
[1:52:56] praise the Lord
[1:52:58] amen
[1:52:59] now I don't want us to to dwell on
[1:53:02] Marion and leave ourselves out of out of
[1:53:04] out of mind I want I want us to think
[1:53:06] about ourselves because
[1:53:08] this is our day this is our time
[1:53:12] praise the Lord
[1:53:15] so brother Brandon would demonstrate how
[1:53:17] she kept that word on her mind
[1:53:20] she kept that that word on her mind a
[1:53:23] virgin shock and see how would that
[1:53:26] happen
[1:53:28] so what what was she doing she was
[1:53:30] taking the seed of God's word into the
[1:53:34] womb of her mind
[1:53:36] you see that's how God bring his promise
[1:53:39] God don't bring his promise when we are
[1:53:42] complaining and arguing when we are
[1:53:44] comparing with other people you know and
[1:53:46] just get all sorts of ugly thoughts on
[1:53:48] our mind no God bring his word to pass
[1:53:51] when we take the promise of God's word
[1:53:54] and keep it on our mind
[1:53:59] she kept that promise on how would this
[1:54:01] happen wow
[1:54:03] praise the Lord Brother man says that
[1:54:05] she and Joseph talk about it he said
[1:54:08] Joseph said I was very disappointed when
[1:54:11] the priest said you know things that God
[1:54:13] used to do he don't do it anymore
[1:54:16] he said I first saw this there was just
[1:54:18] something in me that did not agree with
[1:54:20] that because I believe he is the same
[1:54:22] yesterday today and forever
[1:54:26] praise the Lord
[1:54:27] amen
[1:54:29] so if pondering over the word is if
[1:54:31] keeping the word keeping the promise of
[1:54:34] God on her mind could produce that word
[1:54:37] in her body it can do the same for you
[1:54:44] praise the Lord it can do the very same
[1:54:47] thing for you
[1:54:49] so the prophet of God says after almost
[1:54:52] an entire week she had this thing on her
[1:54:55] mind going and going and and there she
[1:54:58] went to the world and there she made
[1:54:59] that experience let's read something
[1:55:01] here uh we have seen his time brother
[1:55:03] Brahm says when you see something here
[1:55:06] in the scripture you say well now I
[1:55:09] believe that was just for the Apostle I
[1:55:13] believe Jesus did that in the days gone
[1:55:17] by amen praise the Lord like you are
[1:55:20] especially when it comes to decency it
[1:55:22] comes to you know uh uh uh faithfulness
[1:55:25] it comes to uh uh uh uh you know people
[1:55:29] are respecting their home respecting
[1:55:32] their family respecting their marriage
[1:55:34] vow they say oh that's Old Testament
[1:55:36] think amen people dressing decent is oh
[1:55:40] that's Old Testament think now you see
[1:55:42] whenever you do that you push the word
[1:55:44] away
[1:55:45] amen you push the seed of God because
[1:55:48] this Bible like Jesus said man shall not
[1:55:52] lay by bread alone but by every word
[1:55:55] that comes out of the mouth of God
[1:55:58] what is written in this Bible is every
[1:56:01] word that has come from out of God's
[1:56:04] mouth
[1:56:08] praise the Lord
[1:56:12] I believe that was just for the Apostle
[1:56:16] I believe
[1:56:19] Jesus did they are in the days gone by
[1:56:22] but the Bible said he is the same
[1:56:25] yesterday
[1:56:26] today and forever
[1:56:28] praise the Lord just the same
[1:56:32] then if there are sins to be a question
[1:56:36] to you
[1:56:37] and you ponder over it
[1:56:41] he's saying if you read something in the
[1:56:43] scripture like I said before you read
[1:56:45] something in the scripture
[1:56:48] and it surprised you is always an
[1:56:51] opportunity it's always God's way of
[1:56:54] getting your attention
[1:56:57] praise the Lord
[1:56:58] because you're not reading you're not
[1:57:01] reading my my word
[1:57:03] even for you to say well let me see what
[1:57:05] brother one will say about it
[1:57:08] no
[1:57:10] no it's getting your attention
[1:57:13] if you if you just realize that this is
[1:57:16] God's word or I can help you to do is to
[1:57:21] just help the environment of your mind
[1:57:25] if you come in and ask me brother one I
[1:57:27] was reading this in the Bible that the
[1:57:29] Bible says uh uh you know uh and she
[1:57:32] kept all these things and Ponder on them
[1:57:34] well what I would tell you is my
[1:57:36] inspiration about it I believe that she
[1:57:39] was thinking on what the angel told her
[1:57:41] praise the Lord but God that have caught
[1:57:44] your attention
[1:57:46] amen so that's what brother Brown is
[1:57:48] saying here if you just ponder over it
[1:57:53] if you just stop right there that that's
[1:57:56] that's what the you know uh Wednesday
[1:57:58] service was such a blessing anyway
[1:58:00] brother brother Jordan brought the the
[1:58:02] message on Wednesday night if you just
[1:58:04] if you just stop right there they say oh
[1:58:06] Lord
[1:58:07] what are you trying to say to me
[1:58:11] amen
[1:58:14] well I don't understand this but I just
[1:58:16] believe there is something you know
[1:58:17] there there is that moment
[1:58:19] that moment where the word grabs your
[1:58:23] attention there is something there that
[1:58:25] just can't leave your mind
[1:58:27] praise the Lord
[1:58:29] amen
[1:58:30] you you might be listening to a tank and
[1:58:33] remember say something something with
[1:58:35] that a seed would drop in your mind the
[1:58:39] rest of everything that is being said
[1:58:40] even this morning you'll be sitting
[1:58:42] right here the preacher will say
[1:58:43] something there is just one thing would
[1:58:45] wrap your mind the other ones will just
[1:58:48] be going over you keep thinking on that
[1:58:49] you keep thinking on it wow what he said
[1:58:52] that what does that mean it's always an
[1:58:55] opportunity
[1:58:56] praise the Lord if you would just ponder
[1:58:59] over it like brother Barham says here if
[1:59:01] you were born away you can make it out
[1:59:04] and you see
[1:59:06] the things happen and you wondered about
[1:59:10] it then the angel of the Lord in some
[1:59:15] way
[1:59:16] in some way
[1:59:18] praise the Lord sometimes it's not in
[1:59:21] church
[1:59:22] praise the Lord sometimes you are just
[1:59:25] out and about doing your own thing
[1:59:28] but something happened and that word
[1:59:31] that you have Ponder on comes back to
[1:59:33] your mind
[1:59:35] praise the Lord
[1:59:40] the Bible says the angels of the Lord
[1:59:42] are in come about us
[1:59:44] amen
[1:59:46] they go with us when we are out there
[1:59:49] praise the Lord sometimes they use
[1:59:51] things out there and remind us
[1:59:54] it's just that we pull ourselves so much
[1:59:57] to the Natural realm then to the
[2:00:00] spiritual realm if we become sensitive
[2:00:02] to the spirit of God is sensitive to the
[2:00:05] voice of God
[2:00:08] praise the Lord
[2:00:09] you will know when the angel bumped your
[2:00:12] shoulder
[2:00:19] you ponder over it you can't make it out
[2:00:22] you don't have to reason it you don't
[2:00:24] have to make a story by yourself just
[2:00:26] keep it on your mind
[2:00:28] say Lord what is this
[2:00:30] Lord whatever it is be it unto me
[2:00:32] according to your word amen
[2:00:35] amen you can make it out you see things
[2:00:38] and and then you wanna he says then the
[2:00:41] angel of the Lord in some way way
[2:00:44] if you will be sincere
[2:00:48] praise the Lord because sometimes it's
[2:00:51] not just all about giving you great
[2:00:53] understanding sometimes it's addressing
[2:00:55] things in your life
[2:00:59] sometimes it's addressing things in your
[2:01:01] life if you will be sincere
[2:01:05] say yeah Lord that's true
[2:01:07] yeah I really need to deal with that
[2:01:10] I need to deal with that I need to I
[2:01:12] need to get over that
[2:01:14] Lord make me tired amen just make me
[2:01:17] tired with this thing it's true yeah I'm
[2:01:20] the one you're speaking to the Lord is
[2:01:21] true it's your word
[2:01:24] if you will be sincere
[2:01:27] amen
[2:01:30] he will reveal it to you
[2:01:33] and then it's no more a question
[2:01:37] is the truth it is those kind of
[2:01:40] experience
[2:01:42] that no man can preach you out of
[2:01:45] is those kind of an experience that no
[2:01:48] preacher can preach you out of
[2:01:50] praise the Lord because you witness God
[2:01:53] dealing with you he witnessed God
[2:01:56] dealing with you the preacher only come
[2:01:58] and confirm what God is saying but if
[2:02:00] this this matter if you and God no
[2:02:03] preacher can preach you out of faith
[2:02:11] praise the Lord
[2:02:12] amen
[2:02:14] now that's what I want to bring to your
[2:02:15] mind that word at the time that Jesus
[2:02:18] was born was as busy as our word today
[2:02:22] just like how their Christmas season is
[2:02:25] visit around the world commercial
[2:02:26] everywhere and and purchase every word
[2:02:29] and then and basically that word was
[2:02:32] busy because it was just about the time
[2:02:34] where Caesar sargassa asked people to go
[2:02:37] back here for taxation it was a busy
[2:02:39] time
[2:02:40] just like our world is busy
[2:02:43] but yet God yet Angels were appearing to
[2:02:46] people yet God was speaking to people I
[2:02:49] believe in the best world today God can
[2:02:52] still speak to you God can still deal
[2:02:54] with you
[2:02:59] praise the Lord
[2:03:04] it was a busy word
[2:03:06] they were traveling all over the place
[2:03:09] everybody had to go back to to their
[2:03:11] birth city
[2:03:12] for the sensor
[2:03:15] we in a busy world
[2:03:17] praise the Lord
[2:03:19] of out of Kovac everybody is trying to
[2:03:22] balance their their their account where
[2:03:25] we are burning out our money we spend
[2:03:27] our money you know we got a balance our
[2:03:29] account and all of these things are
[2:03:30] happening we want to get a better job we
[2:03:33] want to get a better education in order
[2:03:35] that all of these things we will keep
[2:03:37] dealing with fat until they put us six
[2:03:38] feet
[2:03:44] but what I want to bring to your mind in
[2:03:47] such a Time
[2:03:48] Angels was still appearing
[2:03:51] praise the Lord people were still
[2:03:54] experiencing Angelic visitation
[2:03:57] God was still dealing with some people
[2:04:00] and I believe it the same thing today
[2:04:03] that there are people that God is
[2:04:05] dealing with
[2:04:08] praise the Lord
[2:04:10] amen
[2:04:12] or when it came to the Shepherds it was
[2:04:14] it was there they were doing their
[2:04:15] normal Duty they go they went to work
[2:04:17] they were on the field and it was their
[2:04:19] working time they were not just there
[2:04:21] hanging out
[2:04:23] that was their job they were shepherds
[2:04:26] but yet God was dealing with them on
[2:04:28] their job
[2:04:29] Samia was in the temple God was dealing
[2:04:31] with him on his job Zacharias was in the
[2:04:34] temple waving incense
[2:04:36] the Bible say he was a righteous man and
[2:04:39] God met him at his pulse of Duty God met
[2:04:42] him at his job
[2:04:47] if we would just be sincere
[2:04:51] praise the Lord and don't make other
[2:04:53] people our problem realize that we are
[2:04:56] our own problems
[2:05:04] like I said Wednesday night I mean the
[2:05:07] bride is all about relationship
[2:05:10] it's all about relationship
[2:05:15] that's that's the thing salvation is
[2:05:17] about we have to realize relationship
[2:05:19] was broken in Eden When sin came it
[2:05:23] broke man from that intimate
[2:05:25] relationship with God
[2:05:30] so the coming of Christ a savior on the
[2:05:33] cross a blood sacrifice is to put us
[2:05:36] back into relationship
[2:05:40] now for us to stop at a religion or stop
[2:05:43] at a church is to have that relationship
[2:05:46] and that relationship with the father
[2:05:48] will affect every other relationship
[2:05:51] around us
[2:05:56] that's why John will say why would you
[2:05:58] why would you say that you love God that
[2:06:01] you can see
[2:06:03] and your brother that you see you don't
[2:06:05] love him
[2:06:07] how can you say you have relationship
[2:06:09] with the father
[2:06:14] and I believe that's what this message
[2:06:16] is all about
[2:06:17] it support us in an intimate in a closer
[2:06:22] relationship
[2:06:24] with God
[2:06:25] so much
[2:06:27] that it will affect our relationship
[2:06:29] with our children it will affect our
[2:06:31] relationship with our parents it will
[2:06:34] affect our relationship
[2:06:38] praise the Lord
[2:06:40] with the ones that are around us it does
[2:06:42] not mean that you will not have battle
[2:06:44] yeah you have people that will hate you
[2:06:46] amen
[2:06:48] but the Bible says if a man Waits
[2:06:50] pleases the Lord
[2:06:53] praise the Lord
[2:06:55] if a man Waits pleases the Lord even his
[2:06:58] enemy
[2:06:59] will be at peace with him
[2:07:04] are we together now so you have to
[2:07:06] realize that it was not married Choice
[2:07:09] Mary was not planning in her life
[2:07:12] that I'm going to be this girl that the
[2:07:16] the the I will be this girl I will you
[2:07:20] know I will keep myself and I will bring
[2:07:22] forth the Christ child no it was not
[2:07:25] that's the reason why the angel says
[2:07:26] Thou our favor
[2:07:29] it's a favor
[2:07:32] go a favor you God choose you he call
[2:07:35] you to this holy calling
[2:07:39] it's a favor that we have
[2:07:42] to be able to recognize the message of
[2:07:45] our day
[2:07:46] to recognize that there is a prophet
[2:07:48] that have came into this generation to
[2:07:51] recognize that the seal has been open
[2:07:53] Redemption is back in our hands we can
[2:07:56] go back to the place
[2:07:57] that Adam has fall from this is not just
[2:08:00] for knowledge or for understanding or
[2:08:03] just to be a slogan
[2:08:05] but it's a privilege it's it's Grace
[2:08:07] it's a favor that has come in our hands
[2:08:12] y'all are highly favored
[2:08:15] among women
[2:08:17] and I believe that this bride is highly
[2:08:19] favored
[2:08:24] praise the Lord
[2:08:28] you cannot take
[2:08:30] you cannot take my poor example
[2:08:33] of Christianity
[2:08:35] to say well if if I mean I I don't
[2:08:38] believe in no you cannot take any man's
[2:08:40] failure
[2:08:41] to make it a message truth
[2:08:45] no the message is Jesus Christ the same
[2:08:48] yesterday today and forever
[2:08:51] praise the Lord he's our champion
[2:08:54] no man is out no man is your champion no
[2:08:58] Pastor is your Champion Jesus Christ is
[2:09:00] your Champion he was the one says I gave
[2:09:03] my life freely and I take my life back
[2:09:05] again he was the one that paid the price
[2:09:07] on the cross of calvary
[2:09:09] praise the Lord
[2:09:12] so why why we're in man failure stop me
[2:09:16] from going on with God
[2:09:18] why should a man said I don't believe
[2:09:20] anymore he said because he don't believe
[2:09:22] I also don't believe
[2:09:25] praise the Lord
[2:09:28] oh we love man we love our parents we
[2:09:31] love our pastor but we have only one
[2:09:34] champion
[2:09:35] that's the Lord Jesus Christ he is our
[2:09:38] champion
[2:09:40] glory be to God
[2:09:43] Barbara said God is Simplicity he says
[2:09:45] what Mary taught
[2:09:47] although no matter what the outside
[2:09:51] taught
[2:09:52] she pondered all those things
[2:09:56] praise the Lord
[2:09:58] I believe from the very beginning
[2:10:01] Mary having her wedding on hand
[2:10:05] and now she's going to be expecting a
[2:10:08] child a sure she talks what would people
[2:10:11] think about me
[2:10:14] praise the Lord
[2:10:16] and I'm sure that talk went through her
[2:10:18] mind what would people think about me
[2:10:21] but you see our times goes by The Talk
[2:10:24] change
[2:10:26] who am I
[2:10:28] that gosh you favor me
[2:10:32] praise the Lord when she started saying
[2:10:35] that the wise men traveling two years
[2:10:40] to come and testify of the very same
[2:10:43] thing that she said an angel spoken to
[2:10:46] me when she saw the Angels she pondered
[2:10:50] but this time her pondering was
[2:10:52] different
[2:10:54] her pondering was different
[2:10:56] ah different pondering in our life we go
[2:10:59] through trials and there
[2:11:01] and how am I going through this
[2:11:05] praise the Lord
[2:11:06] just like
[2:11:08] Sarah
[2:11:11] the angel came there and talking to
[2:11:13] Abraham your wife Sarah will have a
[2:11:15] child she laughs
[2:11:18] the angel said why is Sarah laughing
[2:11:21] Abraham also she said no I did not laugh
[2:11:25] praise the Lord she lied about the first
[2:11:28] life
[2:11:29] but when the child was born
[2:11:31] she named him laughter
[2:11:36] she named him laughter
[2:11:41] because the Bible said she laughed I be
[2:11:44] the virus see my age that God will visit
[2:11:48] me oh God what is truth
[2:11:51] praise the Lord so her last laugh
[2:11:56] was different from the first life
[2:12:00] the first love was in
[2:12:03] disbelief
[2:12:07] the last life
[2:12:11] glory be to God
[2:12:13] amen so I believe that Mary had
[2:12:16] different section of pondering things
[2:12:19] would happen she would sit there and she
[2:12:22] pondered I believe even Jesus being on
[2:12:24] the cross
[2:12:26] she sat there she pondered
[2:12:28] because right when she took Jesus to be
[2:12:31] dedicated
[2:12:34] Simeon told her this child
[2:12:36] is for the rising and the falling of
[2:12:39] Israel
[2:12:41] praise the Lord
[2:12:44] and that man told her of things that she
[2:12:47] would go she said every time she she
[2:12:49] would listen to it she would she would
[2:12:50] pull her in her heart
[2:12:55] praise the Lord what kind of a child
[2:12:57] this would be
[2:12:59] that would be for the rising and the
[2:13:01] falling of Israel
[2:13:05] she's not talking
[2:13:07] she's just taking those words in your
[2:13:10] heart
[2:13:12] taking those words in Your Heart Lord
[2:13:14] give me Grace
[2:13:16] Lord help me
[2:13:19] give me Grace
[2:13:21] the Lord
[2:13:23] amen
[2:13:25] Lord help me give me Grace
[2:13:28] what do you think she taught when she
[2:13:30] when when Jesus says a little why you
[2:13:33] will see me no more
[2:13:36] what what what was she Ponder
[2:13:39] do you think that she was rejoicing my
[2:13:41] child is going to die for the word
[2:13:45] for all of those things all of those
[2:13:47] messages that we preach
[2:13:49] starts to come back to her mind
[2:13:52] all of those messages
[2:13:56] praise the Lord
[2:14:04] what Mary taught although no matter what
[2:14:07] the awesome word
[2:14:09] she pondered on all those things they
[2:14:13] hate it in their heart
[2:14:15] or she hid it in your heart they know
[2:14:18] they couldn't say nothing about it
[2:14:21] against it God speaks it to his men
[2:14:26] sometime saying hold your peace don't
[2:14:30] say nothing about it
[2:14:32] praise the Lord amen because it is only
[2:14:36] God that knows the intents of our heart
[2:14:41] the devil don't know the intent of your
[2:14:43] heart no but he has a way to know it you
[2:14:47] frustrate you and pretty soon you will
[2:14:48] say it out
[2:14:50] amen all he can do is just put a little
[2:14:53] bit of pressure on you
[2:14:56] and then pretty soon frustration you get
[2:14:59] you you allow frustration to get the
[2:15:01] best of you
[2:15:02] and then he will say it out
[2:15:04] you allow you to say it out
[2:15:06] but you see brother bam yet is is using
[2:15:09] also married experience how she
[2:15:16] she All Through the Ages you think about
[2:15:18] you think about David
[2:15:20] being anointed as a boy to be king
[2:15:24] when when uh when uh uh uh Samuel
[2:15:27] anointed him Samuel anointed him as a
[2:15:30] king
[2:15:33] but now going through everything that he
[2:15:35] went through in sawhouse Saw Troy and
[2:15:38] Javelin nahim he asked him King am I
[2:15:40] King
[2:15:41] is this the way you treat King
[2:15:44] praise the Lord
[2:15:46] and then when when he had to be a a a
[2:15:50] fugitive running on the hills and
[2:15:52] running all over the place he pondered
[2:15:54] over those things
[2:15:59] why is this happening to me
[2:16:01] why am I going through this
[2:16:04] Invincible Union Brother Band says
[2:16:06] that's the way that God beings for his
[2:16:08] people he bring us down to a place where
[2:16:10] we take an inventory of our life he said
[2:16:13] he allowed tension to come on us he said
[2:16:15] tension is good for the Believers
[2:16:17] because it makes us to take an inventory
[2:16:24] and make us to re-examine our walk with
[2:16:26] God
[2:16:27] praise the Lord
[2:16:29] and he says when you have looked through
[2:16:31] your life and you have looked around and
[2:16:33] and and there is not a reason you can't
[2:16:35] find a sin that you have done you can
[2:16:37] find what is happening then you know
[2:16:39] that God is just setting you out for the
[2:16:42] blessing
[2:16:45] praise the Lord because the religious
[2:16:47] word in every religion every religion
[2:16:50] has learned to believe that evil is
[2:16:52] because of something you have done when
[2:16:54] things are happening wrong to you you
[2:16:56] got to go and appease the Gods
[2:16:59] hmm
[2:17:00] and it's not like that all the time
[2:17:03] praise the lord it's true sin is is the
[2:17:06] reason of all of our problems but
[2:17:08] sometimes when you are going through
[2:17:09] things it's not because you there's a
[2:17:11] there's a there's a sin you have done or
[2:17:13] there's a sin back in your family
[2:17:17] no sometimes God
[2:17:20] is just setting you apart
[2:17:24] he's just setting you apart
[2:17:28] praise the Lord
[2:17:29] amen oh that's that's a scary place to
[2:17:33] get
[2:17:35] for you to be set apart among everybody
[2:17:38] that's the scary place to get
[2:17:41] amen all human life we like it you know
[2:17:44] why you just call the person named stand
[2:17:46] up and start giving them all the praise
[2:17:49] or we like it
[2:17:51] amen we try to act humble we don't want
[2:17:53] to smile buff
[2:18:00] ET what is happening is just like you
[2:18:01] taking an air and pumping the flesh
[2:18:05] you're putting air in the flashlight
[2:18:13] praise the Lord
[2:18:14] but when God does his
[2:18:18] the one that we're supposed to rejoice
[2:18:19] in a smile at
[2:18:22] when he pulled us aside
[2:18:25] praise the Lord
[2:18:29] glory be to God
[2:18:31] you have found favor with God
[2:18:35] you have found favor with God Amen that
[2:18:40] God can deal with you at the age that
[2:18:43] you are you have to you have to remember
[2:18:46] amen he's the ancient of day
[2:18:48] praise the Lord age does not matter to
[2:18:51] him
[2:18:52] what matter to God is his purpose
[2:18:57] praise the lord it's his purpose That's
[2:19:00] What mattered to God not age
[2:19:03] now Suburban says he said that's how he
[2:19:05] deals with his men he allowed them to
[2:19:08] ponder over those things they had them
[2:19:10] in his in in their heart they know they
[2:19:13] can't say nothing about it they just
[2:19:15] watch to see God moving on the scene
[2:19:18] seeing wow this thing will happen
[2:19:20] praise the Lord
[2:19:23] and sometimes they die with those things
[2:19:25] that he kept in their heart
[2:19:28] praise the Lord
[2:19:30] amen
[2:19:31] sometimes they die with those things
[2:19:33] that they kept in their heart
[2:19:43] question and answer he says and I pray
[2:19:45] that each
[2:19:47] one
[2:19:49] of these will take these things
[2:19:52] in their heart and may they ponder over
[2:19:54] it and think like this yes
[2:19:58] there is there is the church there is
[2:20:02] these things that's what the Bible says
[2:20:05] Birmingham talks even about the man on
[2:20:08] the on the road of image Clippers and
[2:20:10] his friends he says and as his friends
[2:20:13] Clippers and his friend was on the road
[2:20:16] of imayers very much discouraged but
[2:20:20] they were pondering on the scriptures
[2:20:26] and that was the thing that Drew Jesus
[2:20:29] on the scene
[2:20:31] they were pondering on the scriptures
[2:20:35] praise the Lord
[2:20:36] amen what a privilege we have uh you
[2:20:40] know as as uh as Believers of the
[2:20:43] message of the hour let me see it that
[2:20:45] way
[2:20:45] amen what a privilege that God would
[2:20:49] take us through the scriptures and teach
[2:20:51] us like this
[2:20:55] you know teach us like this that even
[2:20:57] the negative things that is happening in
[2:20:59] our around our life are enough to give
[2:21:03] us muscles
[2:21:06] praise the Lord enough to be able to
[2:21:09] encourage us to keep pressing or keep
[2:21:11] saving the law
[2:21:16] because that's God's law of dealing with
[2:21:19] the Earth
[2:21:20] he takes the Earth through a dry period
[2:21:23] of time
[2:21:25] a bar on the earth and yet he brought
[2:21:27] forth a guardian of Eden out of it
[2:21:32] like I said God is more concerned about
[2:21:35] his purpose
[2:21:38] he's concerned about his purpose
[2:21:41] concerning your life
[2:21:43] there's a purpose there's a word that is
[2:21:46] hanging over you just like Thy Word of a
[2:21:50] virgin conceived was hanging over Mary
[2:21:55] and when the angel said it unto her
[2:21:59] thank God
[2:22:01] she had the grace to say be it unto me
[2:22:04] according to your word
[2:22:09] thank God she had the grace to say be it
[2:22:12] unto me I call into your word do you
[2:22:14] know what what it would have been
[2:22:17] for Mary to her just start yelling the
[2:22:19] other way
[2:22:21] embarrassing the Angels yeah see that
[2:22:24] somebody talking to me yet about time
[2:22:26] I'm going to get conceitful what is that
[2:22:28] bad dreams
[2:22:32] praise the Lord but you see God
[2:22:35] always prepare us
[2:22:37] because God will never be embarrassed on
[2:22:40] his word
[2:22:42] when he's about to bring his word to
[2:22:44] pass he will never be embarrassed
[2:22:47] even if it's an embarrassed situation
[2:22:51] he's the one that make the fabric of our
[2:22:53] body
[2:22:54] he knows how to hold you down
[2:22:57] praise the Lord
[2:22:58] he knows how to make you to think right
[2:23:01] when even the situation don't look right
[2:23:06] he knows how to condition our mind

[2:26:40] revealed things to us through dreams and
[2:26:43] true Vision through the preaching of his
