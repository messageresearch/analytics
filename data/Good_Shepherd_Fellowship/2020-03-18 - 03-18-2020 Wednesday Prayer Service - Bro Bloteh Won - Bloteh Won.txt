world here Thank You musicians I'll have you back in few minutes here if we can just make this short and sweet tonight praise the Lord Hebrew chapter 2 praise the Lord you know we we sing that song when I see the Blood I will pass over you as if to say we are the one looking for the blood he's looking for the blood what we should be doing is that we should be listening for the blood because we have a blood that speak and better things amen we don't look to see the blood he looks to see the blood but we must be listening amen because the blood speaks praise the Lord Hebrew chapter 2 therefore we ought to give the most energy to the things which we have heard least at any time we should let them sleep for if the word spoken by angels or steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which are the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him father bless your word we are grateful Lord and we want to commit ourselves in your hands now the rest of this service in Jesus name Amen Allah bless you you can have your seat praise the Lord you know in a time of the exiting was gone fast praise the Lord amen everything was don't fine but you have to make sure that you did it right praise the Lord everything was done fast but you have to make sure that you did it right I just I just wanted to go over some few things and especially with the way that as a local church here we want to deal with what the epidemic we are going through and and the loss of the land and all of that it is strip sharor for us to obey the laws of the land so we just want to we want to go over some few things here we will I mean repeat some of them on on Sunday but just like you saw we try to send some text messages out before the service you can look forward for more of him as as the days goes by then and more when when we hear from from the governor you know the major of the city in order you want to make sure that we are obeying their part of God's Word praise the Lord you know it is so easy for many of us you know you go you read a lot of the Watts up messages that is coming you read a lot of the things you know the believers are posting and wish of course they are grading you know people going back in and posting coats or Burt Brennan talk about plagues and he talked about fear and he talks about all of these different things you see and that was the thing that kind of awestruck my heart just at the time we started singing you know and singing about a loaf of God you just you just come to turn terms with how it was in Goshen you know and and you know how it was with these people there in Goshen and yearly from afar mother streaming crying you know the first bond is dating and and and I mean another one is second and he's almost going and I mean all the physician there in Egypt were all running up and down to see how they could save the situation but it was God's wrath amen praise the Lord it's never it's not something that we have to be tell us about in the sense of what we think we can boast about where we think we can laugh about it's something really that is going on you know and and in one way we have to we have to identify with it you know net identifying with the fear but identifying that this thing is real it's causing family lives it's putting pressure on families now sometimes we just think as believers we are just in a bubble that is just going free and you know and and I don't think that is the kind of attitude that that God want us to have in time like this doing the floor brother branham was on the boat up and down the river trying to save people you know he could say well this is judgment God's judgment I'm going down in the mountains to go and seek the face of God we have to deal with it it's real and we've there been said a few things just like some of you saw we we try to put up signs and make sure that as we come through the church before we get in here we can go to the bathroom and wash our hands you know just for the fact that we all fellowship in here we are clapping our hands and you want to give a brother the handshake we want to just make sure that we all go through you know the restaurant wash our hands and then we can come right in here the best way we can do it in this I mean that is the way we should treat it every word I think a good hand-washing goes a long way praise the Lord I don't know whether it's a habit we were getting away from and God has to bring her back to it praise the Lord I'm telling you when this thing is done some people would get good hand-washing then we wash their hands I'm going to go through every door Amy praise the Lord and until we heard a word were they I mean they close down every this morning brother job he asked her with Amy attacks and there came out of Louisiana at a live table and I go down there as you believe there should be the same old life tabernacle or the church by the name of that word the police went in and met the pastor and an axe him there their shoes I mean they should close their service and if they don't he's going to ask the National guy to come in make sure that their service is shut down if every word is shut down why are they gathering people together you know so we might we might get to that place and if and if we get to that place we try to make sure that we can be able to that's you know we can we can be so glad that we have all of these brothers but Angela's brother Jordan brother Lord and every one of them that put in the time to be able to give us this little YouTube channel or website we have where we can be able to have our selves glory in life and we will be talking to fuel the brothers right after the service year but what we would like to do and you will hear more after we get talking with them we have in our Sunday school glory on the tape of demonology it's very strange before I left I spoke with brother Dan and spoke with brother Jordan and Tobler Jordan and I was thinking on I was playing the message impersonation of Christianity that's what I told we were going to study and while I was on my way I was actually on the flooding and and for some reason demonology just hit me there is something in the subject of demonology that hit me so I said well okay I'll take the time and and kind of a review over the entire series since I'm having this long fly you know went through [Music] physical RAM got a rest and started on a spiritual Ram you know and then right there I just I just felt convinced in my heart as it's a well I think we need to play demonology so when I got got home there text birth Jordan and says well you know if we can start on this demonology series I just believe that it was the Lord he men speaking with brother Wesley yesterday and he was commenting a little bit on there you know just just to see they are we dealing with all of this and I mean as a church we are going through the end I know some people can make it for the sunday school but we have you know the Sunday school projected through the YouTube channel or the church website you can be able to follow it and even if you know whether you follow it or net you know is something different when we all listen to it as a congregation and it's also different when you get back and just take that message and go over any game praise the Lord they're things that brother Branham dealing with in that message we'll have time to pick up some of them as we go along praise the Lord because we have to realize he says the lead has been taken off of Hell and demons are sprinkling I mean streaming into the earth you know we we are faced with them every day in different in different ways never have been a time where we had my battles I mean discouragement and little things so to make you never seem a little things to make you angry than all of these things we have to guide our spirit we have a treasure inside that we have to God praise the Lord so we will have the we will go through that their series of demonology and then what we will do is there if the brothers agree with me then you heard it from me if they don't agree with me then what I'm telling you you did not hear it praise the Lord but what I'm thinking about is is for us to open the doors by the eleven o'clock or a few minutes to eleven o'clock we can play the the sunday-school through the tapes maybe the musicians can come in early you know and a few of the people the scenes that would love to come in early that were just we just have to go through that with the brothers because and in one sense too it does not make sense to eliminate or stop everybody because everybody stay don't come you know so if the few that would come will come for the Sunday school I think we would keep it that way so you didn't hear nothing from me and until I talk to them praise the Lord but it is just all for us to be able to keep ourselves in a way that we were net you know cause cry on us amen we believe that every brother and sister is taking enough precaution you know so we don't believe that anybody is running in you know anybody is going to contaminate another person what my mind is all about is having a crowd here and you know a law enforcement or somebody from outside realized that group of people a gathering that's that's where my mind is I'm not I'm not thinking about somebody here could contaminate somebody that's not what I'm thinking about I'm just thinking about you know being being cautious of what people out there think you know and in pretty soon you know it might give us a talk of being fanatic see people are fanatics they don't believe nothing you know in order there so that's what my mind is but we will I mean whatever information we have we would definitely bring that out to you I was trying to do my best like I said to the brothers who try to keep the service shot as much as we can and I would say that was a good atmosphere in here tonight amen praise the Lord amen I sure want to believe that it came from from from the turn of the law but I want to just go over this thought that we were speaking about on on Sunday and I show taught that of a pickup or a cold wobbler Branum canna for reef air Ruth chapter 2 Ruth chapter 2 praise the Lord what a wonderful father we self rule chapter 2 now the scripture speaks here we're talking about just recompense and I know I was kind of a struggling between many thoughts and I don't know if I was able to help you to see what I was talking about but this I was listening to a testimony of her brother and let me let me share it was this is a minister their family went through a rough time and mom and dad had to divorce and and it hurt the family hurt the children most especially the girls when you know the day I was not around to be able to teach them things that it was supposed to to learn so with with that experience I mean they went on and on and on and I mean they all grew up in God my reading I mean try to save the Lord their back slighted and everything but I think it was in the last three weeks of his life he called his family to to his sickbed and then as as the children would testify most especially the girls he said this was the first time that Adele will look into their eyes and apologize and said I'm sorry for all I've caused you people and I mean and I call it to the brother he said there with with tears in his eyes tears streaming down his eyes he says right there his two sister bursted and he started crying you know because this was this was what they have whiffle you know all of their teenage years and now they have grown they have waited for this for their father to see this his words but what happened was when he said that something happened ending something happened inside of him there for the last three weeks of his life he gave us wanted to spend all the time that they have lost all the time that he have lost and what I'm talking about here is is is just recompense like I took the teeth on the cross he might have said something right that God who overlooked all that he have done to give him the equal of those that have been saved all of their life praise the Lord I mean these things are not things that you recite enough things that you I mean you memorize all you premeditate on there are things that comes from the soul it comes from the inside part and as this brother who tell their family testimony how I mean the next time they he went there and met his sister's visiting their dad they singing those old son in school sounds and he just bawling just crying lying on the bed and tears just rolling down his eyes and the girls just crying and remember in Sunday school days and and and I mean God was doing an inner work he was doing an inner healing because a genuine art has repented to a Janu hurt it was the hurt was general as the repentance of the heart and when the bottom met they just melted they just blend it and healing starts to take place he he repented gave his heart back to the Lord and then after three weeks he was gone praise the Lord Ruth chapter 2 the Bible says and the Lord verse 12 the Lord recompense that work this is Boris speaking to Ruth the Lord recompense that work and a full reward be giving being of the Lord God of Israel all know whose wings thou has come to trust praise the Lord can we read that verse together it sounds so beautiful just now the Lord recommends that work and a full reward be giving be of the God the Lord God of Israel all know whose wings thou I come to trust little bit she know that day when she look at now me in the face and say your God will be my god your people will be my people that was not a light word that was something that was coming from the inside she didn't know that she will be hid it her she will be the talk of the town she never even consider that in the Lord of God her her trouble birth was an abomination to God I mean she came from a bloodline that was an abomination to God look that is the place where God goes back and he rewrite his own Lord he rewrites he he take a pen I know where on my face okay I having one year and he goes back on the verse because that was his word no child of the Moabites must come into the congregation what year is so representation by predestination and so crying out to God and said the right thing praise the Lord and God will give her a just recompense he would come her in the lineage of the Messiah because she said the right thing praise Lord amen it's just like a man born an American citizen he has all the rights all the rights that are written in the book in the Constitution but when that man goes to commit a felony in a committed crime that drops him from their Lord and he put into prison now he came vote because he have committed a crime they have taken that right back from him even though he stayed an American citizen but now he has loose setting right now that was where I was bringing equity and iniquity praise the Lord because brother Branham over and over he deal with that more and more over immersion divorce as he was trying to lay the principle in the beginning it was not so he show us how how right from the beginning Adam and Eve were cold equal amen they were cold equal when a word when she broke the word she lost that I call equalness Amen even though the Lord of Redemption was given to her I said this over and over his lama saber burnham said it in invincible union he says that was the reason why God gave her the three sacrifice because he had a lot of redemption in the woman that's why he says the woman si would bruise the head of the serpent that's what he said praise the Lord and even though the Lord of redemption is giving to her and God gave her all of these this blessed veteran and gave her all of these these wonderful character but yet because of that of that Genesis chapter three experience she dropped from that place now you see so it takes the man to bring her back then she can get there because of her education she can get there because of the pay to pay her she can get there because of what united nation says the way that she can get there is submission to the word amen and the love of the word will raise her to that place are we together just like I said the man is broken the woman she's hard because she's taken out of that out of that broken part of the man so she having so much strength but God is is is requiring her to submit that strength amen to that broken vessel where he took her from and the grace to do that that's the power of the church the grace I was just thinking about that last night and I the grace word we can submit our gift to the word we can submit our talent to the world we are able to submit everything we have to the word because sometimes gift can be a dangerous thing amen people have gifts and and and and and because their gifts is so wonderful they tried to take it above the world are we together just recompense he is a just God prays alone he isn't just God he will not forget your liver of love he will reward them that diligently seek Him now that word diligently has been put into a word of works and people think you have to work and work and work and work no and they worked himself out of the scripture they worked himself breaking God's laws because they want to be gain favor with God Ruth doing this she was not seeking to gain favor with God now he has to her I'm old I will not be able to have a child anymore I give you my blessings you can go and live your life I want you to be happy Shema I have told her you know if we get back down there oh my goodness thinking all in her mind what people who said and and she already know that she having a lot of questions to go in answer because she left with her husband and sons and now she is going back and then after answering all of those questions she also have to now talk about a more about that she had brought praise the Lord no no I don't add to my questions I don't believe she said that to her but I mean just allowing them to God praise the Lord just like the words of Peter who will we go to when Peter said those words Oh will we go to four in you we have found internal life this this is the man that would deny Jesus I mean but you see when those things come out of inspiration when it's not something that you have premeditated on and you have plaster with Scripture and plaster with court and and then just drag everything together but something that comes from the human soul and that is the reason why - nada you know I really enjoyed that woman getting into prayer and just going inside and feeling God's love inside the jaw that it gives to know that I am a son of God the inner feeling not the names we put on our forehead or the ones who write on our back but the feeling that is inside praise the Lord the Lord recompense that work and a for reward be giving me of the Lord God of Israel owner whose wings there are come to trust little did she know that when she said your
