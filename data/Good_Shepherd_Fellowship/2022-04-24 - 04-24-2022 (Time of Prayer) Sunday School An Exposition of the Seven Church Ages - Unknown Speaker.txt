TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so [Music] so [Music] and it stands fast he does it and it is done forever none can take from what he says or add to it amen aren't you glad that you serve that kind of a god you can know exactly it means that whatever he said to the first age and to the second and to all ages about his own true church and about the false vine is exactly right and it won't change it means that what he started out with in genesis he will finish in revelation he has two for he is the amen so let it be now we can see again why the devil hates the books of genesis and revelation he hates the truth he knows the truth will prevail he knows what his end will be how he fights that but we are on the winning side we i mean the believers of his word only are on the amen side these things saith the faithful and true witness now i want to show you what i find in the thought of faithful you know you often talk about a great unchanging god whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that man are we all going to get a view of him that it is as though god made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and became a great impersonal god it is as though god made a way of salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross and then when the death of christ has atoned for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him god just folded his arms and stood back it is as if we majored in believing in a great creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation now i say that is how too many people are apt to think but that is wrong thinking for god is governing in the affairs of men right now he is both creator and sustainer colossians 1 16-17 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist he is a sovereign god by his own counsel he purposed the plan of the salvation of his own elect which he foreknew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of salvation and the holy spirit carefully executes the will of the father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of it all he is in the midst of his church this great creator savior god is faithfully working amongst his own right now as the great shepherd of the sheep his very existence is for his own he loves them and cares for them his eye is ever upon them when the word says that your lives are hid with christ in god it means exactly what it says oh i am so glad that my god abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he is true to the word he will back it up he is true to us he will lose none of us but raise us up in the last day i am glad that i am resting in his faithfulness philippians 1 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ he is the true witness now this word true is the same word we saw back there in revelation 3 7. you recall that it does not mean true as in contrast with false it has a richer deeper meaning by far it expresses perfect realization in contrast to partial realization now back in the philadelphian age the coming of the lord was drawing nigh what great love that age manifested for him it reminds me of those beautiful words of first peter 1 8 whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory with them we rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt him we know him now as much as our limiting senses can let us but one day it will be face to face that is for this age he is coming at the end of this age partial realization will be made perfect realization completed realization hallelujah we have been looking through a glass darkly but soon it will be face to face we have been going from glory to glory but soon it will be right in the glory and in his glory we'll shine we shall be like him wondrously like him jesus our savior divine isn't that wonderful we are complete in him that is true he would not lie to us about that but one day we will be change any atoms we will put on immortality we will be all swallowed up in life then we will realize realization he is the faithful and true witness now we think of that word witness well that word is the one we get the word martyr from the bible speaks of stephen and antipas and others as martyrs they were martyrs but they were also witnesses jesus was a faithful martyr the holy ghost is the witness to that the spirit bears record of that the world hated jesus it killed him but god loved him and he went to the father the proof that he went to the father is that the holy ghost came if jesus had not been received of the father the spirit would not have come read it in john 16 7-11 nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged the presence of the holy spirit in this world instead of jesus being here proves that jesus was righteous and went to the father but also said in john 14 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you he sent the comforter he was the comforter he came back in spirit upon the true church he is the faithful and true witness in the midst of the church but one day he is going to come back in flesh again he will prove then who is the only wise potentate it is he jesus christ the lord of glory faithful and true witness creator and sustainer perfect realization the amen of god oh how i love him how i adore him jesus the son of god i want to close my thoughts on this part of this salutation with these words of second corinthians 1 18-22 but as god is true our word toward you was not yea and nay for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us even by me and silvanus and timotheus was not yay and nay but in him was yea for all the promises of god in him are ye and in him amen unto the glory of god by us now he which establisheth us with you in christ and hath anointed us is god who have also sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts the beginning of the creation of god that is who the lord jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that jesus was the first creation of god making him lower than godhead then this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the bible the words are he is the beginner or author of the creation of god now we know for a surety that jesus is god very god he is the creator john 1 3 all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he is the one of whom it is said genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth also it says in exodus 20 11 for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rest of the seventh day see there is no doubt that he is the creator he was the creator of a finished physical creation surely we can see what these words mean now to have any other interpretation would mean that god created god how could god be created when he himself is the creator but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human ovum supplied by mary that would have been simple mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last adam of him it was said blow a body has thou father prepared for me god not mary provided that body mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a god man he was the son of god he was of the new creation man and god met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things are become new there you can see that though man was of the old order or creation now in union with christ he has become the new creation of god ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus unto good works ephesians 4 24 and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and of abraham's issue through the godly isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was god created in the form of man now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself god the creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of god his sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving glory from his brethren if he did not make sure all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass ephesians 2 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will hallelujah aren't you glad that you belong to him the message to the laodicean age revelation 3 15-19 i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou art cold or hot so then because thou art luke warm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counter thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes what eyes have that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent as we have read this together i am sure that you have noticed that the spirit has not said one kind thing about this age he makes two indictments and pronounces his sentence upon them 1 revelation 3 15 and 16 i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou art cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew the out of my mouth we are going to look at this carefully it says that this laodicean church age group is lukewarm this lukewarmness demands a penalty from god the penalty is that they will be spewed out of his mouth here is where we don't want to go astray as a lot of folks do they very unwisely say that god can spew you out of his mouth and that proves that there is no such thing as any truth to the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints i want to correct your thinking right now this verse is not given to an individual it is given to the church he is talking to the church furthermore if you will just keep the word in mind you will recall that nowhere does it say that we are in the mouth of god we are engraved on his palms we are carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages before time we were in his mind we are in his sheepfold and in his pastures but never in his mouth but what is in the mouth of the lord the word is in his mouth matthew 4 4 but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god the word is supposed to be in our mouths too now we know that the church is his body it is here taking his place what will be in the mouth of the church the word first peter 4 11 if any man speak let him speak as the oracle's word of god second peter 1 21 for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy man of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost then what is wrong with these people of the last day they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it i am going to prove that right now the baptists have their creeds and dogmas based on the word and you can't shake them they say the apostolic days of miracles are over and there is no baptism with the holy ghost subsequent to believing the methodists say based on the word there is no water baptism sprinkling is not baptism and that sanctification is a baptism with the holy ghost the church of christ majors in regenerational baptism and in all too many cases they go down dry sinners and come up wet ones yet they claim their doctrine is word based go right down the line and come to the pentecostals do they have the word give them the word test and see they will sell out the word sensation just about every time if you can produce a manifestation like oil and blood and tongues and other signs whether in the word or not or whether properly interpreted from the word the majority will fall for it but what has happened to the word the word has been put aside so god says i am going against you all i will spew you out of my mouth this is the end for seven out of seven ages i have seen nothing but men esteeming their own word above mind so at the end of this age i am spewing you out of my mouth it is all over i am going to speak all right yes i am here in the midst of the church the amen of god faithful and true will reveal himself and it will be by my prophet oh yes that is so revelation 10 7 and in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets there it is he is sending a vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2 000 years he is sending someone who is so far from organization education and the world of religion that is john the baptist and elijah of old he will hear only from god and he will have thus saith the lord and speak for god he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in malachi 4 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works hallelujah do you see it a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends toward dogma and creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the methodists failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age now he has cried out to this last age you have the word you have more bibles than ever but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want you are not interested in living it but debating it i would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected it i could stand that if you would get white hot to know its truth and live it i would praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it i in return must refuse to honor you i will spew you out for you nauseate me now anybody knows that it is lukewarm water that makes you sick at the stomach if you need any medic lukewarm water is about the best thing to drink a lukewarm church has made god sick and he has declared he will spew it out reminds us how he felt just before the flood doesn't it oh would to god the church were cold or hot best of all she should be fervent hot but she is not sentence has been passed she is no longer god's voice to the world she will maintain that she is but god says not oh god still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride as we have said and we will talk more about that later 2 revelation 3 17-18 because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see now look at the first phrase of this verse because thou sayest see they were speaking they were talking as the mouthpiece of god this proves exactly what i said verses 16 through 17 meant but though they say it that does not make it right the catholic church says she speaks for god saying she is the assured voice of the lord how any people can be so spiritually wicked is more than i know but they produce according to the seed which is in them and we know where that seed came from don't we the laodicean church is saying i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing that was her self estimate she looked at herself and that is what she saw she said i am rich which means that she is wealthy in the things of this world she is boasting in the face of james 2 5-7 hearken my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him but ye have despised the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats do they not blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called now i do not suggest that a rich person cannot be spiritual but we all know that the word says very few are it is the poor that predominate in the body of the true church now then if the church becomes full of wealth we know only one thing ichabod has been written over her portals you can't deny that for that is the word talk about wealth in the church why there never has been such a show of wealth the beautiful sanctuaries are multiplied in number as never before the various groups buy with each other to see who can build the biggest and the loveliest and they build education centers worth unestimated millions and those buildings are used only an hour or two a week now that would not be such a terrible thing but they expect this little time spent by the children in the education plant to take the place of the hours of training supposed to be given in the home money has poured into the church until different denominations own stocks and bonds factories oil wells and insurance companies they have poured money into welfare and retirement funds now this sounds good but it has become a snare to the ministers for if they decide to leave their group for more light or the love of god their pensions are lost to them most can't stand this and stay with their pressure groups now don't forget that this is the last age we know that this is the last age because israel has gone back to palestine if we believe that he really is coming then there must be something wrong with those who are building so vastly it makes one think that these people plan on staying here forever or that the coming of jesus is hundreds of years old do you know that religion today is known as big business it is an absolute fact that they are placing business managers in the churches to take care of finances is this what god desires did not his word teach us in the book of acts that seven men full of the holy ghost and faith serve the lord in business matters you can surely see why god said you say you are wealthy i never said so there are radio programs television programs and numerous church endeavors that are costing millions and millions of dollars wealth pours and pours into the church the membership increases along with the money yet the work is not being done as it was done when there was no money but men rested solely on the ability given them by the holy ghost there are paid preachers paid assistance paid ministers of music and education paid choirs paid custodians programs and entertainment all costing great sums but for all that the power is decreasing yes the church is rich but the power is not there god moves by his spirit not by the amount of money or talent in the church now i want to show you how diabolical this urge for money has become the churches have gone all out to get a membership especially of the wealthy everywhere there is the cry to make religion so attractive and appealing that the rich and cultured and all who have worldly prestige will come in and be active in the church can't they understand that if wealth is the criterion of spirituality then the world already has god has all of god and the church has nothing thou sayest i am increased with goods this literally means i have spiritual riches this sounds like the millennium with streets of gold and the presence of god but i wonder if this is so is the church truly rich in the spiritual things of god let us examine this 20th century laodicean boast in the light of the word if the church were truly spiritually rich its influence would be felt upon community life but exactly what kind of lives are these so-called spiritual and influential men of the community living out in suburbia out in the better class districts there are bounds wife swapping prostitution and bands of children crashing parties exacting a terrible toll in property damage immorality has reached an all-time high in promiscuous sex acts narcotic addiction gambling stealing and all kinds of evil and the church goes on claiming how fine is this generation how full are the churches and how responsive are even the natives on the mission fields the church has turned the people over to the doctors especially the psychiatrists how it can prayed about being rich spiritually is more than i know it isn't true they are bankrupt and don't know it take a good look around you examine the people as they walk by in the multitudes you see can you pick out those that have the appearance of christians watch how they dress watch how they act hear what they say see where they go surely there ought to be some real evidence of the new birth amongst all those we see go by but few there be yet today the fundamental churches are telling us they have millions saved and even spirit-filled spirit-filled can you call women spirit-filled who go around with frizzy bobbed hair shorts and slacks halters and briefs all painted up like jezebel if these are adorned in modest apparel as becometh christian women i would hate to think what it would be like if i had to witness a display of immodesty now i know that the women don't set the styles hollywood does that but listen ladies they still sell yard goods and sewing machines you don't have to buy what's in the stores and then use that as an excuse this is a deadly serious matter that i am going into have you not read in scripture that when a man looks on a woman and lusts after her in his heart he has already committed adultery with her in his heart and suppose you dressed in such a way as to cause that that makes you his partner in sin even though you would be absolutely unaware of it being a true virgin with no such desires yet god holds you accountable and you will be judged now i know you ladies don't like this kind of preaching but sister you are dead wrong in what you are doing the bible forbids you to cut your hair god gave it for a covering he gave a command for you to wear it long it is your glory when you cut your hair you signify that you left the headship of your husband like eve you walked out and went on your own you got to vote you took man's jobs you left off being females you ought to repent and come back to god and if all this wasn't bad enough a whole lot of you took the idea that you could invade the pulpits and the church offices that god reserved for men and for men only oh i touched a sore spot then didn't i well show me one place in the bible that god ever ordained any woman to preach or take authority over a man and i will apologize for what i have said you can't find that i am wrong i am right for i stand with the word and in the word if you were spiritually rich you would know that is true there is nothing true but the word paul said i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man you can't possibly take a place amongst the five-fold ministry of ephesians four and not take authority over men sister you had better listen to that word it was not the spirit of god manifesting in a spirit-filled life that told you to preach because the spirit and the word are one they say the same thing somebody made a mistake somebody was fooled wake up before it is too late satan fooled eve your mother he is fooling the daughters now may god help you i have need of nothing now when anybody says i have need of nothing he could very well be saying i have everything or he could be saying i don't want any more as i am full now you can express this any way you want and it all adds up to the fact that the church is complacent she is satisfied with what she has she either figures she has it all or has enough and that is exactly what we find today what denomination is not claiming that it has the revelation and the power and the truth listen to the baptists and they have it all listen to the methodists and they have it all listen to the church of christ and everyone is wrong but them hear what the pentecostals say and they have the fullness of the fullness now they know i am telling the truth about them for not one of their manuals say any different they wrote it all out just so nice and put their names to it and finished it all up god just doesn't have any more and there are those who just don't want anymore they do not believe in healing and would not want it although it is in the word there are those who would not take the holy spirit if god opened the heavens and showed them a sign now they are all saying and trying to prove that they have it all or they have enough yet is that the truth compare this 20th century church to the first century church go ahead do that where is the power where is the love where is the purified church that withstood sin and walked with faith toward jesus where is the unity you can't find it if this church has all it needs why were they crying out for more of god in the book of acts as though they didn't have it all and yet they had far more than they have today god's diagnosis now what god saw wasn't [Music] you
