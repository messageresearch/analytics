[45:42] the Lord
[45:46] amen we were gone during the week as uh
[45:50] as uh we we announced last week and uh
[45:53] for uh the missions meeting over in uh
[45:57] North Carolina that's my my first time
[45:59] being there uh I've heard about it over
[46:03] the years and and uh now you'll realize
[46:08] that uh for many many many many years
[46:11] most of the time
[46:13] around this year around this time uh May
[46:17] June July
[46:19] August uh you will see that uh uh we
[46:23] have a lot of traffic of preachers that
[46:26] come through through our our
[46:28] church and uh uh uh some I'm I'm paying
[46:35] back for the days of my
[46:41] pilgrimage for the days of my pilgrimage
[46:43] so uh whenever they come most of the
[46:46] brothers that come they like they love
[46:48] to come and see us and uh you know
[46:51] sometimes it's h it's it's a lot of work
[46:54] it's a toll on us as a small Church to
[46:57] you know to sponsor uh lot of those
[47:00] brothers that come because we have to
[47:01] fly them in we have to fly them out LOD
[47:04] them while the year feed them while the
[47:06] year so it's a lot of t on us and uh uh
[47:12] but many of them come in that period of
[47:16] the year because of those missions
[47:19] meeting now brother uh Simmons there he
[47:23] has a uh uh a 10 meeting a camp meeting
[47:27] 10 meeting that he's been having for
[47:29] many years so it goes to the 10 meeting
[47:32] so the 10 meeting and the Min the the
[47:35] missionary meeting is just back to back
[47:38] you know they always have it one week
[47:40] the 10 meeting and then the next week is
[47:43] over in uh one week in South Carolina
[47:45] then the next week in North Carolina
[47:47] with brother Joe Green Joseph green uh
[47:50] we having sometime in September I think
[47:53] uh the te week in September he should
[47:56] come down Vis with pass now brother Joe
[47:59] Green took over the church from Brother
[48:01] Dan desley Dan desley took the church
[48:04] took over that church from brother Joe
[48:06] Green's father so Joe Green's father
[48:08] those were some of the early Pioneers
[48:11] that uh you know took the message to
[48:14] many parts of uh South America most
[48:17] especially he started to work back in
[48:19] Jamaica and uh you know and and many of
[48:22] these brothers so what the what the
[48:24] brothers would do is that during the
[48:26] year many of the brothers will send some
[48:28] form of missionary offering over to
[48:31] Bible Tabernacle brother Joe Green's
[48:33] church and the those those uh missionary
[48:37] offering that will be sent during the
[48:39] year brothers from all around the world
[48:42] will send their Church need uh uh
[48:45] building needs uh you know people want
[48:48] of uh uh most especially most of the
[48:51] brothers in the Philippines want a uh a
[48:53] Mite uh to be able to uh uh do
[48:56] missionary work uh and different things
[48:59] so there the All the Monies that will
[49:01] come during the year will be put
[49:04] together the needs will be read during
[49:07] every service they will they will call
[49:10] the different needs and they would give
[49:11] the sum that is needed to meet all of
[49:14] those needs sometimes the funds don't
[49:17] meet you know uh all of the needs but
[49:20] they will use the funds that will com in
[49:23] and then they will minister to the most
[49:25] needed there are brothers that will sit
[49:28] and judge and say we think that this
[49:30] need is most needed and this need is
[49:33] most needed and so they will distribute
[49:35] their funds to that need so uh I mean
[49:39] this is something that been going going
[49:41] on uh this year was the
[49:45] 51st 51
[49:47] years 51 years and many many uh uh many
[49:52] of the churches uh around the world has
[49:58] been benefited from
[50:00] that many of the brothers in in po
[50:04] countries has benefited from that even
[50:07] some of our brothers in Liberia has
[50:09] benefited from that Nigeria Ghana and
[50:12] then just the rest of that so we I just
[50:14] wanted to go in and uh but also it was
[50:18] because there's there's a flot of uh uh
[50:21] brothers from from the aost that went
[50:24] for the meeting in Trinidad you know uh
[50:29] I thought that it was it was too much if
[50:31] I have every one of them come to see me
[50:33] it would be too much of unexpensive so I
[50:35] just thought I needed to go down and and
[50:38] just use one stone and uh I was able to
[50:42] hit I wanted to hit two I hit three so
[50:45] there's another family uh uh good family
[50:49] uh uh friend of ours in in in the
[50:52] message that I needed to see visit with
[50:56] them and just just to be able to help
[50:58] them on some situation so I also have to
[51:01] do that so yeah so it was good many of
[51:03] the brothers send their meetings I mean
[51:05] greetings brother Valentine uh he's
[51:08] around uh sister uni there he sent his
[51:11] greetings and uh Pastor Paul Pastor J
[51:15] all of those brothers from the a coast
[51:16] send their greetings and most of the
[51:18] other brothers that came in uh for the
[51:22] meeting they all send their greetings
[51:25] and uh uh one of the brother brother
[51:27] nick uh um brother nick uh uh what
[51:33] What's his soul name from South Africa
[51:35] and uh uh if some of you would remember
[51:39] a couple of years ago we we pray for the
[51:42] family that had a lust in a motor
[51:45] accident and uh they were coming from a
[51:47] camp meeting I mean a tent meeting uh uh
[51:51] and then uh they had an accident two
[51:55] vehicles and uh so brother nck lost his
[51:59] mother he lost his sister and he lost
[52:02] his
[52:03] brother-in-law and uh uh his dead
[52:07] survived the accident and I
[52:11] so uh
[52:13] uh he was also part of the meeting and
[52:16] he spoke uh uh Wednesday morning he
[52:20] spoke on Wednesday morning and uh uh he
[52:24] just testified he just test testified
[52:27] and and his testimony was really really
[52:29] tremendous really really tremendous he
[52:32] was speaking on on something uh and he
[52:35] said the supernatural cannot be
[52:39] explained he said you how can you
[52:41] explain something
[52:42] Supernatural all you can say is It's
[52:45] Supernatural you know the supernatural
[52:47] cannot be explained and you know and
[52:50] because of all of uh the margin of error
[52:55] that we have had around
[52:57] uh the church word it's hard for people
[52:59] to believe the
[53:00] supernatural praise the Lord but yet the
[53:03] God we believe he
[53:05] Supernatural amen so he was testifying
[53:08] on the Supernatural and uh because he
[53:11] just he just came out of a supernatural
[53:13] experience you know he's a farmer they
[53:15] they do farming there they have a huge
[53:18] Farm of of of cattles and and and Peaks
[53:21] so there there a there a form of drought
[53:23] there and and uh and and also the virus
[53:26] that was killing lot of their p with the
[53:29] drought they couldn't get he they
[53:32] couldn't get uh uh the amount of milk
[53:35] that he needed to Fe feed the the pig
[53:38] farm so and and he was about to to
[53:43] travel coming for the meetings and uh uh
[53:47] uh NE shenek yeah that's his
[53:53] name so he went over to one of the farm
[53:58] where they normally get their their
[54:00] their milk supply and when he got the
[54:04] farm told him we don't have milk you
[54:06] know it's been coupled of uh uh uh you
[54:10] know uh this whole weekend you know uh
[54:12] we don't have milk so he said he left uh
[54:15] the container he called the the you know
[54:19] the gallon and you know the continue he
[54:20] left it huge continue he said he left it
[54:23] there and just told the man if uh you
[54:25] know if there would be uh in because
[54:28] what they do is that uh you know they
[54:31] were they uh uh you know they milk the
[54:35] cows and then uh uh the process the milk
[54:38] is a milk processing farm and then the
[54:41] the SPO milk is what they gave over to
[54:44] the C the pig farmers and they go and
[54:47] feed the pigs with it so I mean they
[54:49] didn't hide in but he left his uh you
[54:52] know uh thing there took it down from
[54:54] the pickup left it there and went back
[54:57] and uh uh uh I think two days before he
[55:01] would make his trip to the states he
[55:03] decided to go back there you know called
[55:05] the man the man told him you know yeah
[55:07] we we don't I mean really we sorry we
[55:09] didn't have milk to to be able to uh to
[55:13] give you but what happened is that when
[55:16] he got back there the the the Contin he
[55:21] left a very big barrel was filled with
[55:24] water
[55:26] and he said for the first instant he got
[55:30] mad I was supposed to get milk why is it
[55:33] filled with water you know and uh uh so
[55:40] uh but then he asked the farmers to load
[55:43] it onto his
[55:45] truck and he drove it back to the
[55:49] farm so when he got back to the farm the
[55:52] you know the the wife he came with his
[55:54] wife and daughter you know and he you
[55:57] know told them this is what you know I
[55:59] don't know what what's wrong I mean they
[56:02] put milk I mean water into the the T and
[56:05] all of there and uh uh you know and the
[56:09] wife you know the wife told him well you
[56:11] know well um you know you just uh you
[56:15] just got to deal with it or just go and
[56:17] empty it out uh you know and something
[56:19] like that so he said well he was just
[56:22] trying to figure out what to do because
[56:24] I mean the paks were dying and uh but
[56:28] for some reason he didn't turn the water
[56:31] out of the out of the continer he just
[56:33] left it there for the next uh two days
[56:37] uh a couple of days that he had for for
[56:40] them to come and they were really
[56:42] praying they were desperate in need you
[56:44] know because their their livelihood was
[56:47] was perishing right before them you know
[56:49] and and out of the so he went uh uh uh
[56:54] the following day that I mean he in the
[56:56] the family they gathered to pray and you
[56:58] know they just uh committed things in
[57:00] the hands of the Lord believing that God
[57:03] will
[57:03] supernaturally you know provide for them
[57:07] so this morning he went down now to go
[57:11] and open what should have been the water
[57:14] in the continue now uh that that's
[57:17] that's not even the miracle when he went
[57:19] to open the gallon he realized that it
[57:22] was
[57:24] milk that's not even the miracle
[57:26] that's not the miracle so he he called
[57:30] his
[57:31] wife and he start you know he started
[57:34] yelling he called his wife and says and
[57:37] say uh uh uh is did you know he said
[57:41] because he said he opened he opened the
[57:43] the container when when he before he
[57:45] took it from the farm he says uh did the
[57:49] the water turn into
[57:51] milk okay so they they they started
[57:55] filling
[57:56] they the contining and started feeling
[57:59] the Peaks but the the miracle that is
[58:02] there is that the next morning their
[58:04] gallon was full again with
[58:10] [Applause]
[58:14] milk praise the Lord now so even if the
[58:19] farmer put milk inside and cover it with
[58:22] water who put the next one there the
[58:24] next day
[58:27] praise the
[58:28] Lord and he said they had abundant of
[58:35] milk it just took all the stress of him
[58:39] praise the Lord amen so all he was
[58:42] saying that morning I don't care if you
[58:44] believe it or not I was
[58:47] there
[58:51] praise it's up to you to believe it or
[58:54] not he said but I was there
[58:58] and that was just beautiful I mean he
[59:00] just he just fired the place up
[59:02] amen he just fired the place up praise
[59:06] the Lord amen and we were supposed to
[59:10] stop to see our friend brother jeun and

[59:14] prayer I wanted to go to see him but uh
[59:18] uh he was sick so sister

[59:50] Wednesday night service I would just
[59:52] tell you that uh I enjoy the service

[1:00:05] continue with that thought and I saw
[1:00:07] that brother Dan pick it up in a
[1:00:09] different way talking about

[1:00:17] will will make it special this morning
[1:00:19] amen take the book and eat so we read it
[1:00:22] in Revelation chapter 10 like I said the
[1:00:24] book that was open in Revelation chapter
[1:00:26] 5 no man was wored to take the
[1:00:29] book to even handle
[1:00:33] it to open it and the lamb came forth
[1:00:37] and took the book and he loosed the
[1:00:39] seals thereof now the book from the
[1:00:43] hands of the wealthy one the book from
[1:00:45] the hands of god let's say that that way
[1:00:48] because he's the worthy one he came down
[1:00:50] and gave the book to a messenger on the
[1:00:53] earth amen and that messenger was to
[1:00:56] bring
[1:00:56] us what was in the book bring us the
[1:00:59] mystery that was in the book The Secret
[1:01:01] that was sealed in the book now here it
[1:01:04] said now the book has passed from the
[1:01:06] hands of uh of the Lamb to the seven
[1:01:10] angel in in in Revelation chapter uh uh
[1:01:14] 10 verse 8 now John has to take the book
[1:01:18] so from the hands of the Lamb to the
[1:01:20] seven angel now John is the one that is
[1:01:23] telling the seven Angel give me the book
[1:01:25] book and John represent the church he
[1:01:28] represent the bride amen that's the
[1:01:31] reason why we repeated the phrase give
[1:01:33] me the book because that is what we
[1:01:36] supposed to be saying amen don't give me
[1:01:38] Creeds don't give me stories give me the
[1:01:41] book amen that that should be the bride
[1:01:44] response that should be the bride cry
[1:01:47] give me the book amen so yes said John
[1:01:51] took the book from the hands of the
[1:01:54] seven Angel and he was store to eat the
[1:01:58] book and when he eat the book it will be
[1:02:01] sweet the knowledge of the word is
[1:02:05] sweet but the
[1:02:07] manifestation can be
[1:02:09] better
[1:02:11] amen just to get the word in your head
[1:02:14] and say the Bible say the Bible say the
[1:02:16] Bible say it can be sweet but to live
[1:02:19] what the Bible
[1:02:20] say can be better sometimes amen so John
[1:02:24] at the book and he said it was sweet in
[1:02:27] his mouth but when it got in his belly
[1:02:30] it was bit Genesis chapter 2 let's go
[1:02:32] back to

[1:03:06] from the
[1:03:08] meeting brother V and myself we sat them
[1:03:11] up talking about things I mean talking
[1:03:13] about things you know uh Church things
[1:03:17] actually and different things until
[1:03:19] almost 5 a.m. in the
[1:03:21] morning then I went to see this family
[1:03:24] that I wanted to visit sat down until 5:
[1:03:27] a.m. in the morning I asked myself what
[1:03:29] are you doing and I'm supposed to go to

[1:03:37] sleep because I need to I need to make
[1:03:39] sure I get out of here that I will not
[1:03:42] miss my flight amen so I'm a little bit
[1:03:45] a little bit amen so just pray for
[1:03:50] me Genesis chapter 2
[1:03:56] Genesis chapter
[1:03:58] 2 you know you know the story of Genesis
[1:04:01] chapter 2 verse one thus the Heaven and
[1:04:04] the Earth was finished and all the host
[1:04:08] of them Genesis chapter 2:4 this are the
[1:04:12] generation of the heavens and the earth
[1:04:15] when they were created in the day that
[1:04:17] the Lord God made the earth and the
[1:04:19] heavens praise the Lord are we together
[1:04:23] so now uh uh uh one thing I want you if
[1:04:27] you want to if you want to take a time
[1:04:29] and and just do your own personal study
[1:04:31] on it when you go back to Genesis
[1:04:33] chapter one you look through all the
[1:04:35] verses the Bible will tell you and God
[1:04:38] created and God blessed and God said and
[1:04:41] God said when you come to Genesis
[1:04:43] chapter 2 the Bible uses the word and
[1:04:47] the Lord
[1:04:50] God praise the Lord and the Lord God
[1:04:57] is two different
[1:04:59] manifestation two different
[1:05:01] manifestation you have to realize that
[1:05:04] the Lord God speaks of Jehovah that
[1:05:07] God's family name now he's dwelling with
[1:05:11] his attributes he's dwelling with his
[1:05:14] creation so the scripture is identifying
[1:05:17] him as the Lord
[1:05:19] God Genesis chapter one the word God
[1:05:23] there is Elohim the self-existing one
[1:05:27] amen that's that is just for your own
[1:05:30] Bible study if you just want to look
[1:05:31] through and just and just be able to
[1:05:33] pick it up
[1:05:35] there and uh but the the the creation is
[1:05:39] made Genesis chapter 2 here testify from
[1:05:42] from verse one over to verse three you
[1:05:45] know and God rested and then God is
[1:05:48] declaring this is the generation of the
[1:05:51] heavens and the earth when they were
[1:05:53] created this is everything that is made
[1:05:55] now this is the beginning of time this
[1:05:57] is everything that is made now he's
[1:05:59] testifying let's let's go a little bit
[1:06:02] let's drop down to verse eight that's
[1:06:04] what I really want to get you this
[1:06:06] morning and the Lord God planted a
[1:06:09] garden in the east east word of
[1:06:12] Eden and there he put the
[1:06:16] man whom he has formed praise the Lord
[1:06:21] Genesis chapter 7 God has just formed a
[1:06:24] man out of the Dust of the earth like we
[1:06:28] have learned before in the book of uh uh
[1:06:31] uh uh ecclesiastic the Bible says man
[1:06:35] was formed upright so man was formed and
[1:06:38] his toes was like root in the earth it
[1:06:41] was not like uh you know like we we we
[1:06:44] all see that God formed no man was
[1:06:46] formed upright so his toes was in the
[1:06:49] earth and God birth into his nostril and
[1:06:52] when the Breath of Life came he just
[1:06:54] kicked his foot off of the the Earth and
[1:06:56] started
[1:06:59] moving praise the
[1:07:01] Lord
[1:07:03] hallelujah now so man was formed in
[1:07:05] verse seven and God and the Lord God
[1:07:08] formed man of the Dust of the ground and
[1:07:10] breath into his nostr and the breath of
[1:07:13] the breath of life and Man became a
[1:07:15] living Soul verse eight and the Lord God
[1:07:18] planted the garden in the East W and
[1:07:20] there where he put that man let's go to
[1:07:22] verse N Pay attention now and out of the
[1:07:27] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[1:07:31] tree that is Pleasant to the
[1:07:34] eyes and good for food amen praise the
[1:07:40] Lord are we together amen out of the
[1:07:46] ground the Lord
[1:07:52] God grow every tree that is less to the
[1:07:56] to the sight and is good for
[1:08:00] food and the tree of life also in the
[1:08:05] midst of the garden and the
[1:08:10] tree of knowledge good and evil so every
[1:08:15] tree that was good for
[1:08:18] food was made praise the Lord amen and
[1:08:23] here the Bible also will speak of two
[1:08:27] trees here which is the tree of life and
[1:08:30] where did the Bible say the tree of life
[1:08:35] was it was in the Mist it was in the
[1:08:38] middle that word mist mean the middle
[1:08:41] praise the Lord are we
[1:08:44] together amen I want you to pay
[1:08:47] attention if not is going to go over
[1:08:49] your head it will go over your
[1:08:53] head praise the Lord you know you know
[1:08:55] I'm not a good speaker so you got to pay
[1:08:58] attention to really grab where I'm
[1:09:00] going so trees that were pleasant and
[1:09:05] good for food was made and the tree of
[1:09:08] life was in the middle in the center of
[1:09:11] the garden and there was another tree
[1:09:13] that's was called the tree of knowledge
[1:09:16] good and evil are we together praise the
[1:09:20] Lord let's drop down to verse
[1:09:23] 16 let's drop down down to verse
[1:09:33] 16 verse 15 and the Lord God took the
[1:09:37] man and put him in the
[1:09:40] Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep
[1:09:44] it now he has a work to do and the Lord
[1:09:48] God
[1:09:50] commanded amen and the Lord God
[1:09:54] commanded
[1:09:56] and when we when we were doing our sub
[1:09:58] our study on the beginning if you
[1:10:01] remember this this was the first
[1:10:04] commandment in the beginning the first
[1:10:07] time the Bible will talk about
[1:10:09] commandment or command it the Lord God
[1:10:14] commanded this was the first
[1:10:17] commandment are we
[1:10:21] together I can feed you I know you you
[1:10:24] you on the edge you just just watching
[1:10:25] to see where he's going just stay that
[1:10:29] way and the Lord God commanded the man
[1:10:32] saying seeing the Commandments thatat of
[1:10:37] every tree of the garden thou May freely
[1:10:41] eat but of the tree of
[1:10:45] knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall
[1:10:50] not eat of it for in the day that thou e
[1:10:55] eth thereof thou sh surely die are we
[1:11:00] together
[1:11:02] amen and and and in our studies if you
[1:11:06] can remember that was the first
[1:11:08] commandment and how many words it
[1:11:15] has how many words the first commandment
[1:11:19] has 39 if you count it in your Bible it
[1:11:23] should be 39 words
[1:11:28] of every tree beginning from of every
[1:11:31] tree to surely died it should be 39
[1:11:36] words the devil only added one to make
[1:11:39] it 4ed and 40 is the number of
[1:11:42] Temptation praise the Lord is these
[1:11:45] things are not new we have we have
[1:11:47] taught you here before we wanted we want
[1:11:49] you to sing there we want you to know
[1:11:52] that amen
[1:11:56] the first commandment was 39
[1:12:06] words are we
[1:12:09] together now so we see
[1:12:13] here God gave a commandment of every
[1:12:17] tree thou shall eat but the tree of
[1:12:21] knowledge and good and evil Thou shalt
[1:12:23] not eat for in the day that thou eateth
[1:12:28] th eateth thereof thou shall surely die
[1:12:32] Genesis chapter 3 verse one are you
[1:12:36] following
[1:12:44] me are you seeing the
[1:12:48] progression are we
[1:12:51] together now the serpent was more subti
[1:12:55] than any beast of the field which the
[1:12:58] Lord God has made and he said unto the
[1:13:01] woman yeah have God said listen
[1:13:04] carefully people it pays to listen it
[1:13:08] pays to pay
[1:13:09] attention have God said ye shall not eat
[1:13:13] of every tree of the
[1:13:17] garden and the woman said unto the
[1:13:20] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:13:26] Trees of the
[1:13:27] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:13:32] which is in the midst of the garden God
[1:13:36] have said ye shall not eat of it neither
[1:13:41] shall ye touch it least ye die what's
[1:13:45] wrong with that
[1:13:52] picture what's wrong with the picture
[1:13:57] misinformation that's a lie but uh where
[1:14:00] is where is the lie that's that's what I
[1:14:02] want for us to see because that's that's
[1:14:05] where I want to dwell on this morning if
[1:14:07] you go back over to to to chapter
[1:14:12] two it will be too much reading but you
[1:14:15] already know the verses Chapter two The
[1:14:19] Bible told us it was the tree of life
[1:14:24] that was in in the
[1:14:27] Mist are we
[1:14:29] together the tree that God told them not
[1:14:32] to eat it was never mentioned that it
[1:14:36] was in the
[1:14:40] Mist are you seeing the
[1:14:42] picture praise the Lord amen so the
[1:14:47] position of the tree of life was
[1:14:49] overshadow
[1:14:55] it is the treat of
[1:14:57] life it has
[1:15:00] life if they eat of it they will ever
[1:15:02] have
[1:15:03] life but for death to come the treat of
[1:15:07] Life had to be
[1:15:14] overshadowed so what happened here over
[1:15:17] time the devil overshadow the tree of
[1:15:23] life and put the church mind and put Eve
[1:15:27] mind on the tree of knowledge good and
[1:15:34] evil the Tree of Life That's supposed to
[1:15:36] be in the middle the tree of life was in
[1:15:39] the middle it did not lose its position
[1:15:42] it was just
[1:15:46] overshadow and now she's saying that God
[1:15:49] says we can eat of every tree but the
[1:15:52] tree that is in the midst no
[1:15:59] how come that tree got in the
[1:16:01] midst how did it came into the
[1:16:04] middle
[1:16:08] focus when our focus is taken from the
[1:16:12] important thing the less important thing
[1:16:15] becomes
[1:16:23] important are we together
[1:16:26] and what is important here is Jesus
[1:16:29] Christ what is important in the in our
[1:16:32] Christian faith is Jesus
[1:16:37] Christ but when the devil can take our
[1:16:41] Focus from on Christ and put our focus
[1:16:44] on church and on politics and on
[1:16:47] different thing now those things now
[1:16:50] become the center of our
[1:16:53] life the Tre of life is now
[1:16:58] overshadow the Tree of Life That's
[1:17:00] supposed to be the center that holds
[1:17:02] everything together is now
[1:17:09] overshadow are you seeing the picture
[1:17:12] praise the Lord but the tree of life has
[1:17:15] not lost its
[1:17:18] position it has n Revelation chapter 2
[1:17:25] I don't want to preach this morning but
[1:17:27] you're making me wanting to preach
[1:17:29] because I'm I'm the preaching is coming
[1:17:31] a little
[1:17:33] bit Revelation Chapter 2 you love the
[1:17:36] Lord amen are we together praise the
[1:17:41] Lord ah
[1:17:46] yeah Revelation Chapter 2 let's let's
[1:17:48] look here in Revelation Chapter 2 and
[1:17:51] see
[1:17:53] yeah
[1:17:55] sh Revelation chap 2:
[1:17:59] 7 you got the picture you see where we
[1:18:02] go in this morning amen the tree of life
[1:18:06] has been overshadowed and that's what is
[1:18:09] happening in our life that's that's why
[1:18:11] we have the problem that we are having
[1:18:13] the things that are major has been
[1:18:14] overshadowed the less minor things is
[1:18:17] what is what is destroyed is what we are
[1:18:19] eating of or is what is eating us up now
[1:18:24] Revelation chapter
[1:18:25] 2 uh uh uh verse 7 the bible
[1:18:31] says are we
[1:18:34] together you love the Lord
[1:18:39] amen the Bible says here verse
[1:18:44] 7 he that have an ear let him hear what
[1:18:47] the spirit says unto the churches for
[1:18:49] him that overcometh will I give to eat
[1:18:53] of the tree of life which is in the
[1:18:58] midst of the paradise of
[1:19:02] God so the tree of life never left its
[1:19:07] position it was overshadowed Through the
[1:19:11] Ages but in the church age God that's
[1:19:16] that's what the seals is all about
[1:19:19] that's what the Beast and the anointing
[1:19:21] is all about is God moving the enemy
[1:19:25] liit so once again his children can be
[1:19:29] exposed to the Tree of
[1:19:32] Life praise the Lord amen the word
[1:19:35] exposing the devil to get him out of the
[1:19:38] way so once again you and myself can
[1:19:42] feed directly from the Tree of
[1:19:47] Life do you see the picture amen the
[1:19:52] Bible says of every tree
[1:19:55] you can eat the tree of life was right
[1:19:57] there in the midst in the midst of the
[1:20:02] garden so we see that this deception in
[1:20:06] Genesis chapter 3 happened over
[1:20:11] time it was not just a one day
[1:20:14] thing it was a constant conversation of
[1:20:19] the seent in Eve and all he was trying
[1:20:22] to do was just overshot out the Tree of
[1:20:25] Life why because he's a father of
[1:20:29] death he wanted to kill God's
[1:20:32] creation he wanted to introduce death
[1:20:36] into the human Ray so the best way to do
[1:20:38] it overshadow the Tree of Life let the
[1:20:41] people eat from the Tree of knowledge
[1:20:43] and evil praise the Lord and then they
[1:20:46] will die because the day you eat of that
[1:20:48] tree that day you will
[1:20:51] die and he achieved it
[1:20:56] because when he asked Eve the God say
[1:20:58] you shouldn't eat of any of these tree
[1:21:00] he said no no no he said we can eat but
[1:21:02] the tree that is in the midst why the
[1:21:05] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil have
[1:21:08] now positioned itself in the middle for
[1:21:16] her are we
[1:21:20] together glory be to God that's the
[1:21:23] problem with the
[1:21:25] church that's the problem with the
[1:21:30] church because we are eating from this
[1:21:32] overshadow
[1:21:35] tree that's what has happened that's the
[1:21:37] reason why every Revival died that's the
[1:21:40] reason why every church
[1:21:49] denominated because all the devil the
[1:21:52] the devil don't want to take your church
[1:21:53] away
[1:21:55] amen he just want to give you a form of
[1:22:00] godliness if he can take the power away
[1:22:03] from the church and just give you a form
[1:22:05] of godliness give you a church name you
[1:22:07] know H and give you some uh some things
[1:22:11] to observe don't do this do that don't
[1:22:13] do this do that that's all he
[1:22:16] wants that just all he
[1:22:20] wants to to keep you away from the treat
[1:22:23] of life
[1:22:27] he want to overshadow the treat of life
[1:22:29] in your home overshadow the treat of
[1:22:31] life in your life overshadow the Tree of
[1:22:33] Life in the church we can just come play
[1:22:37] church have F and never have access to
[1:22:40] the
[1:22:44] word get on the word talks about things
[1:22:47] that you know that that that concern us
[1:22:50] things that we are dealing with in our
[1:22:52] life then we get angry
[1:22:55] then we get
[1:22:59] mad are we
[1:23:01] together praise the
[1:23:07] Lord so you see the
[1:23:10] picture you see the
[1:23:13] picture praise the Lord or not
[1:23:17] yet do I need to develop it do you see
[1:23:20] the
[1:23:21] picture do you see that the treat of
[1:23:24] life has has been
[1:23:25] overshadowed
[1:23:27] amen do you see that Eve now has a wrong
[1:23:30] she has a wrong
[1:23:33] testimony amen the Commandment that was
[1:23:36] given to her she's testifying you're
[1:23:38] wrong she's telling a lie that's not
[1:23:41] what God
[1:23:44] Said and that's what the church is doing
[1:23:47] we are telling the lies by the way we
[1:23:49] are living we are telling the lies by
[1:23:51] the things that we are doing because
[1:23:52] that's not what God said his church
[1:23:54] would
[1:23:58] do let's go a little bit here you know I
[1:24:02] was I I was thinking about this this
[1:24:04] morning uh I woke up earli this morning
[1:24:07] and trying to find my bearings I was
[1:24:09] thinking about this and and then I
[1:24:11] thought about you know uh uh I just
[1:24:14] having it on my mind I'm going to talk
[1:24:15] about e the book now you will realize
[1:24:19] that you go back to history a little bit
[1:24:22] you will realize that uh

[1:27:25] sign to go and the Angels Came Down in
[1:27:27] the mberry tree that's why money have
[1:27:29] [Laughter]
[1:27:33] wings please don't go and preach
[1:27:39] that
[1:27:42] uh but yes
[1:27:45] papers were made out of trees and it's
[1:27:49] it's it's beautiful because you can you
[1:27:51] can just see how
[1:27:55] almighty God the word of God don't make
[1:27:59] mistake amen God don't make mistake in
[1:28:02] his
[1:28:03] word his word is
[1:28:06] truth amen you just you follow the
[1:28:09] context of the word you just see it from
[1:28:12] Genesis to Revelation you follow it you
[1:28:15] realize that God word is
[1:28:21] truth are we together yeah there God
[1:28:24] there in Genesis God is telling uh uh uh
[1:28:27] his first son uh uh eat of every
[1:28:31] tree here in Revelation he's telling us
[1:28:34] take the book and eat it it's the same
[1:28:37] thing if you eat the book you are eating
[1:28:39] the
[1:28:40] tree it's the same
[1:28:45] thing are we together praise the
[1:28:48] Lord are we together now so that's
[1:28:53] that's that's where
[1:28:54] I I I want to I want to get our mind to
[1:28:57] this morning that we talking on take the
[1:28:59] book and eat it now if you look at the
[1:29:03] word eat the word eat I it has many many
[1:29:08] definition I take one definition from
[1:29:10] the many definition that it has the word
[1:29:13] it means to
[1:29:15] consume you will soon see where I'm
[1:29:17] going with
[1:29:19] that because you will realize that it is
[1:29:21] not only with the mouth we eat
[1:29:29] praise the
[1:29:31] Lord you consume things with your
[1:29:34] eyes you consume things with your
[1:29:38] mind it's a form of
[1:29:41] eating and the same way you cons things
[1:29:44] you consume with your mouth your body
[1:29:47] can benefit from it or it can affect
[1:29:50] your body that's the same way things you
[1:29:53] eat with your ey
[1:29:54] all your
[1:29:58] mind can destroy your
[1:30:07] body are we
[1:30:10] together and the reason why I think is
[1:30:13] important because this is in in this our
[1:30:17] age signs have got us to that
[1:30:21] place praise the Lord people consume so
[1:30:24] much with their mind that their body
[1:30:27] don't feel
[1:30:33] hungry especially with our information
[1:30:36] and technology age I mean they get so
[1:30:39] much into
[1:30:43] that that they even forget that they
[1:30:45] have not even eaten
[1:30:54] praise the Lord now you tell me now tell
[1:30:57] me if if we are consuming the tree of
[1:31:01] life like
[1:31:05] that if we were consuming the tree of
[1:31:08] life so much that we are not feeling
[1:31:11] hungry for physical food what a
[1:31:14] Victorious Life we will be living what
[1:31:17] an overcoming life we will be living
[1:31:29] I CAU you to the right
[1:31:30] place I take you around the block I
[1:31:33] think you ready for preaching this
[1:31:34] morning amen I try I'll do my
[1:31:39] best so here said that
[1:31:48] God in Genesis chapter 1 verse 11 the
[1:31:53] Bible says and God said Elohim said let
[1:31:56] let the F bring forth GES and Herb
[1:31:59] yelding
[1:32:01] seeds and the fruit trees yelling fruit
[1:32:04] after his kinds whose seeds is in it
[1:32:08] upon the Earth and it was so praise the
[1:32:11] Lord so the first time there Elohim the
[1:32:15] spirit of God moving upon the Earth God
[1:32:18] breathe upon the Earth and says let the
[1:32:20] Earth bring forth
[1:32:22] seeds let it bring for ples let us bring
[1:32:25] for
[1:32:28] trees are we
[1:32:34] together now over here in Genesis
[1:32:37] chapter chapter 2 the Bible here now
[1:32:40] will make us to know in verse 8 of that
[1:32:44] promise that God made that the Earth
[1:32:46] should bring forth seeds and bring forth
[1:32:49] plants God year in in verse 8 and the
[1:32:52] lord god Jehovah over Elohim planted a
[1:32:56] garden Eastward of Eden and there he put
[1:32:59] the man that he had form and out of the
[1:33:02] ground the Lord God grow every tree that
[1:33:05] is Pleasant to the eyes and good for
[1:33:08] food praise the Lord over in Genesis
[1:33:12] chapter one he prophesied he said let
[1:33:15] the Earth bring
[1:33:16] forth praise the Lord over here in
[1:33:19] Genesis chapter 2 he's bringing the
[1:33:21] prophecy to pass
[1:33:24] amen he's bringing trees he's bringing
[1:33:28] fruits out of the
[1:33:31] earth that is going to be pleasant to
[1:33:34] the eyes and good for
[1:33:37] food glory to
[1:33:39] God
[1:33:41] Amen
[1:33:44] Hallelujah and then right in the midst
[1:33:47] of
[1:33:49] that he put himself that's what Jesus
[1:33:53] said men shall not live by bread alone
[1:33:56] but by every word that proceed from the
[1:33:58] mouth of
[1:34:03] God the tree of life was placed right in
[1:34:06] the middle of all of those trees that
[1:34:08] were eing fruits and herbs and good for
[1:34:10] food and blessing to the eye right in
[1:34:13] the middle of it God put the tree of
[1:34:15] life in the middle that you will not
[1:34:18] miss it it's not in the back it's not on
[1:34:21] the far extreme it's right in the middle
[1:34:27] are we
[1:34:28] together glory be to
[1:34:31] God
[1:34:34] Amen but just as we as we as as we as we
[1:34:37] have discovered here in our in our Bible
[1:34:40] status you realize that the enemy
[1:34:43] overshadowed this
[1:34:44] tree because when God there in in in in
[1:34:48] in verse 16 and 17 when he gave men the
[1:34:52] first commandment you can eat of all of
[1:34:54] these tree but this tree of of knowledge
[1:34:57] good and evil the day you eat of it that
[1:35:00] day you will die the devil say okay I
[1:35:02] see how I we get them if I can just
[1:35:06] shift praise the Lord if I can just
[1:35:12] shift their mind take their mind off of
[1:35:15] the tree of
[1:35:17] life if I can just overshadow the Tree
[1:35:20] of Life
[1:35:26] and make them to focus on the tree of
[1:35:28] knowledge good and
[1:35:30] evil that this is where the problem
[1:35:34] is if we can partake of this we will be
[1:35:37] smart we can get a better word we can
[1:35:40] make this Garden of Eden
[1:35:44] bigger the tree of life never moved it
[1:35:48] was just
[1:35:51] overshadow praise the Lord it was just
[1:35:54] overshadow and that's what the devil
[1:35:56] does all the time Jesus Christ is the
[1:35:59] same yesterday today and forever but if
[1:36:02] the devil can make your problem to
[1:36:04] overshadow God you will never believe
[1:36:06] that God exists all you will see is your
[1:36:12] problem but God is bigger than your
[1:36:14] problem but why we make our problem so
[1:36:21] big why we make a situation so great
[1:36:25] when we are believing and serving a god
[1:36:28] that is bigger than
[1:36:31] everything but the devil would take one
[1:36:34] little insignificant thing and
[1:36:38] overshadow everything you know about God
[1:36:41] everything you heard about God
[1:36:43] everything that God has done for you he
[1:36:45] will take that little insignificant
[1:36:48] thing overshadow God and all you can see
[1:36:52] my problem my sick
[1:37:06] praise the
[1:37:07] Lord are we
[1:37:10] together my my my
[1:37:14] my you love the Lord this
[1:37:17] morning he's a wonderful
[1:37:20] God he's a wonderful God let me read
[1:37:23] something to you this morning
[1:37:30] so God want to provide a place of
[1:37:34] worship listen to
[1:37:41] this you will realize that it's not only
[1:37:45] in Revelation you go you go you go over
[1:37:48] to the Book of Jeremiah God told
[1:37:51] Jeremiah to take the straw and eat it
[1:37:53] praise the Lord so brother BR is going
[1:37:55] to bring that in a way for us to be able
[1:37:58] to to grab a picture here because we are
[1:38:00] told to take the book in Ed it a prophet
[1:38:03] is
[1:38:04] God's
[1:38:06] reflector
[1:38:08] amen as the old saying goes you are what
[1:38:12] you
[1:38:15] eat
[1:38:17] amen that's what the old saying says you
[1:38:19] are what you eat what you are eating
[1:38:22] will ref reflect on you we will see it
[1:38:26] through your
[1:38:27] actions you are what you
[1:38:32] eat a prophet is God God's reflector how
[1:38:36] many knows that their reflector doesn't
[1:38:40] reflect
[1:38:43] itself no the reflector
[1:38:47] reflect the one that is supposed to
[1:38:50] reflect amen if the prophet is God
[1:38:53] reflect ref leor than the prophet
[1:38:54] reflects God Amen your mirror is your
[1:39:00] reflector the mirror do not show itself
[1:39:02] the mirror show you when you stand
[1:39:04] before the mirror your your being is
[1:39:08] reflected praise the
[1:39:10] Lord let man see your good work and
[1:39:13] glorify your father so you are a
[1:39:16] reflector it's not supposed to be about
[1:39:19] you it's supposed to be about him
[1:39:23] if you are really a reflector it must be
[1:39:26] about him and not about
[1:39:38] you the reflector doesn't reflect
[1:39:41] itself the reflector is in the
[1:39:45] reflection no he's not the reflection
[1:39:49] he's reflecting somebody the son of man
[1:39:52] Ministry was to reflect the reality of
[1:39:55] Jesus Christ to
[1:39:57] us it was not to reflect brother
[1:40:00] Brandon no he was the
[1:40:03] reflector that through him once again we
[1:40:06] will see a man turning his back to the
[1:40:09] congregation and calling people by names
[1:40:12] and telling them the situation in their
[1:40:17] lives because that's what Jesus did he
[1:40:21] told the woman at the word the things
[1:40:24] that she has
[1:40:29] done the reflector is not the
[1:40:35] reflection are we

[1:42:09] you if you say aoud amen I might jump up
[1:42:11] from my
[1:42:13] sleep but let's go together let's let's
[1:42:15] read it this
[1:42:17] morning a prophet is God reflected how
[1:42:20] many knows that there reflector doesn't
[1:42:24] reflect itself the reflector isn't the
[1:42:28] reflection there has to be something
[1:42:31] strike the reflector something has to
[1:42:34] strike it and that's the thing about
[1:42:36] Christian Life until God strik you you
[1:42:40] will never reflect
[1:42:43] God you can reflect your church you can
[1:42:45] reflect your tradition you can reflect
[1:42:47] your idea but God had to struct you when
[1:42:51] Paul said it is no longer that live but
[1:42:54] Christ that live in me because God
[1:42:57] struck him on the road of Damascus from
[1:43:00] his
[1:43:01] H something have to strike the reflector
[1:43:05] for you to be a reflector something have
[1:43:08] to strict you something must make a
[1:43:10] difference a church membership is not
[1:43:20] enough that's the reason why we have uh
[1:43:23] uh uh you know Church bnch bunch of
[1:43:26] ARS
[1:43:30] Fighters this word of God must be
[1:43:32] changing our
[1:43:34] lives this word of God must be bringing
[1:43:36] us into the image of Jesus
[1:43:42] Christ there has to be something struck
[1:43:44] the reflector reflector is made to
[1:43:49] reflect so it's a prophet it's a chosing
[1:43:53] vessel of God that cannot reflect
[1:43:56] nothing at all but he's in direct line
[1:44:02] with the
[1:44:04] reflector
[1:44:05] amen Jesus said I can do nothing but
[1:44:09] what the father reflect on
[1:44:12] me what the father Reve to
[1:44:17] me I can do
[1:44:20] nothing he says if you see me you see
[1:44:22] the father because why I'm his
[1:44:28] reflector praise the
[1:44:30] lord we want to reflect our tradition
[1:44:32] and reflect our ideas and reflect uh and
[1:44:35] uh uh our Hollywood stars and all of
[1:44:38] that why why we want to do that because
[1:44:41] the tree of life is
[1:44:46] overshadow the tree of life is
[1:44:48] overshadow we are eating from the Tree
[1:44:50] of knowledge good and evil but God come
[1:44:53] back in the church ages expose the devil
[1:44:57] and get him out of the way once again
[1:44:59] the church can eat on the Tree of
[1:45:07] Life praise the Lord are we
[1:45:11] together good I'm doing
[1:45:15] good praise the
[1:45:21] Lord now because that's what I'm
[1:45:23] supposed to do as a pastor I'm supposed
[1:45:25] to keep you together amen so if I say
[1:45:27] are we together you say yes I should say
[1:45:28] I'm doing good
[1:45:32] amen so a prophet is a chosen vessel of
[1:45:36] God that cannot reflect nothing at all
[1:45:40] but he's
[1:45:42] in direct
[1:45:44] line with that
[1:45:47] reflection
[1:45:48] God to reflect the image of Christ the
[1:45:52] word
[1:45:54] nothing else can do it praise the Lord
[1:45:58] nothing else can do it no matter how we
[1:46:01] try to impersonate
[1:46:04] it how we try to impersonate it so it is
[1:46:08] not the
[1:46:11] man it has to be that man being struck
[1:46:16] by the
[1:46:18] reflector praise the
[1:46:20] Lord amen we can impersonate it try to
[1:46:24] impersonate discernment try to
[1:46:26] impersonate Healing Ministry we can do
[1:46:28] all of that but if my life is not
[1:46:34] strucked by the one I'm supposed to be
[1:46:37] reflecting if God don't comes down and
[1:46:40] and and and and Strack His Image in the
[1:46:42] bin nothing nothing you just play the
[1:46:44] drama at the end of the
[1:46:48] day your fullness will be made known
[1:46:52] praise the
[1:46:53] Lord that's that's the reason why that's
[1:46:56] the reason why he got himself a church a
[1:46:59] bride because why the Bride is a
[1:47:02] reflector of the bridegroom she don't
[1:47:04] have an idea of
[1:47:08] herself praise the lord it's hard to get
[1:47:11] all of these independent churches
[1:47:13] submitted to the world why because they
[1:47:15] have their form of Doctrine they have
[1:47:17] their organization they have their
[1:47:19] Bishops to look to so you gave them the
[1:47:22] word they will not take it but the Bride
[1:47:25] of Jesus Christ she have one person that
[1:47:27] she submit to that's the Lord Jesus
[1:47:31] Christ she don't have her own
[1:47:40] idea that's what the marriage covenant
[1:47:42] is all about she don't have her own
[1:47:48] idea are we together
[1:47:53] she don't have her own
[1:47:55] Revelation she don't have her own
[1:47:57] understanding she's only it
[1:48:01] reflecting praise the Lord
[1:48:05] amen you go stand before the miror you
[1:48:07] see somebody you don't see yourself you
[1:48:09] stand
[1:48:10] there are you going to stand
[1:48:12] there you go look in the mirror you
[1:48:15] don't see yourself you see somebody can
[1:48:16] you stand there
[1:48:23] if you running then you lucky some will
[1:48:25] drop
[1:48:27] dead if you able to run from that room
[1:48:30] then you luck it which mean you are
[1:48:32] eating
[1:48:33] well some will just stand right there
[1:48:35] drop there
[1:48:38] yeah praise the
[1:48:42] Lord that's the reason why we have we
[1:48:44] have in dead churches we having people
[1:48:47] dying in the
[1:48:49] PE because we supposed to be seeing
[1:48:51] Christ we seeing bunch of confusion
[1:48:53] bunch of facets bunch of
[1:49:06] Divisions but he's in line with the with
[1:49:08] the reflection God to reflect the image
[1:49:11] of Christ the word nothing else can do
[1:49:14] it you are a reflector that's the reason
[1:49:19] listen now that's the reason the prophet
[1:49:23] hard to eat the book because you are
[1:49:26] what you
[1:49:28] eat praise the
[1:49:30] Lord you cannot expect Christ to come
[1:49:33] out of your life if all you eat is
[1:49:36] social
[1:49:39] media if all you are eating is social
[1:49:42] media you cannot expect Christ to come
[1:49:44] out of your life
[1:49:53] praise the
[1:50:03] Lord you are a reflector then that's the
[1:50:05] reason the prophet had to eat the book
[1:50:08] that's the reason he had to eat the
[1:50:11] straw that's Jeremiah and even and and
[1:50:14] even what what John tells us there in
[1:50:16] Revelation he had to reflect that word
[1:50:20] for that age
[1:50:22] and if John is representing you and
[1:50:25] myself through the church
[1:50:27] ages and he's told to take the book and
[1:50:30] eat
[1:50:31] it why because you have to prophesy
[1:50:34] again that's what prophecy is you are
[1:50:36] reflecting what you are eat you what you
[1:50:38] are eating you are giving it
[1:50:46] back praise the
[1:50:49] Lord you see the the church we have come
[1:50:52] up with all sorts of form and you all
[1:50:54] sorts of program things so oh let's do

[1:54:32] media the
[1:54:38] media is lying to us it's filling us
[1:54:40] with
[1:54:42] lies I was just reading something
[1:54:46] yesterday and looking at some
[1:54:49] documentary how the big corporate system
[1:54:51] are behind the media they govern the
[1:54:54] media they tell them what to put out
[1:54:59] there they give the the the the the
[1:55:02] influence the
[1:55:06] narrative the influence the
[1:55:09] narrative and we listen to it and then
[1:55:11] we start fing with one
[1:55:13] another no they said this no but me this
[1:55:17] this this
[1:55:20] this praise the Lord
[1:55:28] L I was I was I was looking into
[1:55:31] something and uh uh just trying to bring
[1:55:35] uh talk on the strong
[1:55:38] delusion because definitely that's what
[1:55:40] the age is honor it's honor a strong
[1:55:43] delusion praise the lord we have been
[1:55:45] fed with so much
[1:55:49] lies that the truth can be staring right
[1:55:51] in our
[1:55:53] face our mind cannot turn
[1:55:59] over because our mind has been fed with
[1:56:02] so much
[1:56:03] lies that truth can be staring right in
[1:56:06] your
[1:56:08] face and there is no way to click over
[1:56:11] just to turn over just to turn
[1:56:19] it we can see the truth we can be told
[1:56:22] the truth we know that is the
[1:56:25] truth but because we have been filed
[1:56:27] with so much of our
[1:56:32] personalities to just accept and say yes
[1:56:35] that's the truth that's that's a that's
[1:56:36] a big thing we struggle we must defend
[1:56:42] ourself when you know exactly that what
[1:56:45] you have been told is the truth
[1:56:58] that's the reason why there is just they
[1:57:00] just want you to to to tell them tell
[1:57:02] them about the games tell them about the
[1:57:06] Olympics tell them about the new
[1:57:08] development and the new
[1:57:11] technology praise the
[1:57:16] Lord but you see that's that's what it
[1:57:19] was all
[1:57:20] about because think about it people
[1:57:23] think about it now think about it
[1:57:26] before Adam fell there was no sense of
[1:57:30] hunger so how was he
[1:57:36] eating why was he
[1:57:39] eating was he eating yes he was
[1:57:45] eating but you see as long as he kept
[1:57:48] the the the the his focus on the treat
[1:57:50] of life as long as he was consuming the
[1:57:54] tree of life it was easier for him to
[1:57:57] step out and be a Son of God and say I
[1:58:00] don't want this tree here I wanted this
[1:58:02] this
[1:58:03] place why because he was feeding from
[1:58:06] that tree of
[1:58:07] life just one taste from the Tree of
[1:58:10] knowledge good and evil he's hiding
[1:58:11] behind the
[1:58:12] tree he's
[1:58:16] hiding and that's what we do hide behind
[1:58:19] excuses
[1:58:26] praise the
[1:58:28] Lord so you see it was not it's not all
[1:58:30] about what soup you cook and what uh you
[1:58:33] know what you have on the on the menu
[1:58:35] that that was that was not what it was
[1:58:36] it was all about consum
[1:58:42] it what you take into
[1:58:46] yourself that get a hold of you that
[1:58:49] consume you
[1:58:53] praise the Lord that influence you that
[1:58:56] detects to your
[1:58:58] actions that's what eating
[1:59:03] is praise the Lord because sometimes you
[1:59:06] see even people that goes on diet if you
[1:59:09] don't get your mind right you can eat
[1:59:11] all the leaves you will stay the same

[1:59:19] not your mind is not in a positive
[1:59:21] direction
[1:59:23] and sometimes people get on diet you
[1:59:25] know where they are doing everything but
[1:59:27] because of the constant they keep
[1:59:29] telling thems oh I'm not I'm not what I
[1:59:31] supposed to be on they they they D thems
[1:59:34] to
[1:59:44] death praise the
[1:59:47] Lord so it's not just about what we put
[1:59:50] in our mouth our mind
[1:59:55] our mind is the biggest consume consumer
[1:59:58] of our being that we
[2:00:04] have because you could be sitting right

[2:03:09] 24 Matthew chapter
[2:03:14] 24 Matthew chapter 24

[2:03:37] bring out this thing I just want to
[2:03:38] bring something to you as we close here
[2:03:42] Jesus last last Sunday we talk about the
[2:03:44] same thing when you talking about
[2:03:46] spiritual drunkenness but uh Jesus bring
[2:03:49] out something here that that that goes
[2:03:51] in line with what we talked about uh
[2:03:53] last week he says in Matthew 24 let's
[2:03:56] read from 46 blessed is the seven whom
[2:03:59] the Lord when he cometh shall find
[2:04:02] doing amen verily I said unto you that
[2:04:07] he shall make himself
[2:04:09] ruler over all his Goods but and if that
[2:04:14] evil servant shall say in his heart my
[2:04:16] Lord deliv his coming now we have had
[2:04:21] many many messages on the delayed I
[2:04:23] remember Joe funny preached the delay
[2:04:25] yeah I don't I don't remember whether it
[2:04:27] was the first message he preached here
[2:04:29] the first time I was in this church uh
[2:04:32] uh but he preached for us here the delay
[2:04:34] and we have many brothers that have
[2:04:36] preached the delay I preached the delay
[2:04:38] myself but there this is this is
[2:04:40] something of the delay I want for us to
[2:04:42] pay attention to uh
[2:04:46] uh Jesus says but if thy evil servant
[2:04:49] shall say it in his heart my Lord
[2:04:51] delayed his coming and shall begin to
[2:04:53] Smart his fellow
[2:04:55] servants and to eat and drink with the
[2:04:59] drunken the Lord the Lord of thy servant
[2:05:02] shall come in the day when he lookth not
[2:05:06] for him and in an hour that he is not
[2:05:10] aware praise the
[2:05:12] Lord now so Jesus is making us to know
[2:05:17] uh something that we have to was for in
[2:05:19] the delayed year is there as as as the
[2:05:23] Lord delayed delayed his coming there
[2:05:26] there they are going to be there are
[2:05:27] going to be uh uh uh people that are
[2:05:29] going to use that delay as an excuse

[2:05:35] on the delayed and also cause divisions
[2:05:38] you know and and and fces and smarting
[2:05:40] their friend forces fighting and all of
[2:05:43] that but then he also
[2:05:46] describe what puts a man in that
[2:05:50] condition praise the Lord
[2:05:54] amen what make him to start smarting and
[2:05:57] and you know fighting causing Division
[2:06:00] and all of
[2:06:01] that a spirit that will come on the
[2:06:04] edge the Bible said it in the same the
[2:06:07] same as it was in the days of Noah what
[2:06:09] were they doing eating and
[2:06:13] drinking when we talk about eating and
[2:06:16] drinking we just think that it's just
[2:06:17] too much food no they were consuming
[2:06:21] they are consum consuming things
[2:06:23] consuming substances consuming different
[2:06:26] things that's what is happening to our
[2:06:31] age this is the age where people are con

[2:07:11] people into that unrest they put it's
[2:07:15] it's it's in a place of of of not not
[2:07:20] satisfied so we get to the place now he

[2:08:34] they look at all of these things that
[2:08:36] have been said and they say in their
[2:08:38] heart that they are above the word of
[2:08:40] God they are just adding drunken to

[2:18:33] the
[2:18:34] drunken it's not just alcohol is a thing
[2:18:37] that is consuming the mind like I said

[2:18:42] people see all the the disgrace with the
[2:18:46] politicians they out campaigning and
[2:18:48] saying everything that they are saying
[2:18:49] you just want to get in off we get the
[2:18:51] same old

[2:19:20] us the word of God bring us satisfaction
[2:19:23] it bring us
[2:19:25] hope that's what we are talking about it
[2:19:27] bring us
[2:19:30] hope when I sing I'm Bound for the
[2:19:33] promised land is not just a song it's
[2:19:36] something that is in
[2:19:46] me musicians you can come
[2:19:56] what are we consuming what are we
[2:19:58] feeding our minds
[2:20:03] with in this age the Tree of Life Is
[2:20:06] Back amen the tree of life is back to
[2:20:12] Exposition the tree of life has been
[2:20:15] repositioned back in the middle of the
[2:20:18] paradise of God
[2:20:20] that's the reason why the word of God
[2:20:22] take the preeminence in our service it's
[2:20:24] not about programs or games or
[2:20:28] whatsoever because the Tree of Life Is
[2:20:31] Back In This Place All Through the Ages
[2:20:34] the Holy Ghost has been fighting to get
[2:20:37] the tree of knowledge Paul says I never
[2:20:39] come to you with enticing words of men
[2:20:41] wisdom I come so you can see the
[2:20:43] demonstration of the Holy
[2:20:45] Ghost what were they doing trying to
[2:20:48] push back the treat of knowledge push
[2:20:51] back all the doctrine Creed nian spirit
[2:20:54] that have governed the church so once
[2:20:57] again the people can be exposed to the
[2:20:59] treat of Life take the word of God let
[2:21:01] it make sense to
[2:21:04] you let the word of God affect your
[2:21:12] life it's all to glorify God it's not to
[2:21:16] make a big name and make a big follower
[2:21:19] following
[2:21:22] but you see our mind has been so abused
[2:21:25] it's it's it's almost people have just
[2:21:27] like people that get get addicted to
[2:21:30] food no matter what you tell them uh oh
[2:21:33] they give them this other choice no
[2:21:34] because that's what they have consume
[2:21:36] over and over and over and over nothing
[2:21:39] else will
[2:21:41] satisfy until they get that same thing
[2:21:46] again people that struggle with habits
[2:21:49] people that struggle with things in
[2:21:51] their
[2:21:51] lives we keep consuming the same thing
