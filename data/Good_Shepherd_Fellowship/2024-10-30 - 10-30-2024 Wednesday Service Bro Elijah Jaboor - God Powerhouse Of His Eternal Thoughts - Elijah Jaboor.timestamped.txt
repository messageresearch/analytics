[12:09] [Music]
[12:13] amen praise the
[12:15] Lord before we uh
[12:19] uh go to that
[12:22] tonight I would just want to read um a
[12:25] few things uh just a quote or two before
[12:28] we pray
[12:35] from the
[12:36] message
[12:39] Faith Africa trip
[12:47] report brother Brandon talks about
[12:51] uh
[12:53] uh he says if the blessing placed on you
[13:00] hold
[13:02] still sometimes it's a day before he can
[13:06] get to
[13:09] you Daniel Prayed one time and the angel
[13:13] didn't get to
[13:15] him for 21 days is that
[13:19] right I have seen the
[13:23] time where women and men will wait for
[13:27] weeks and the the first thing you know
[13:30] all at once it
[13:32] happens the angel passing through the
[13:37] neighborhood I've been thinking about
[13:39] that and just realizing everything that
[13:42] is happening in our
[13:44] neighborhood and everything that we want
[13:46] to happen in our neighborhood I believe
[13:49] the Angels Take pass in the neighborhood
[13:53] amen and you see the angel just don't
[13:56] pass in the neighborhood
[13:59] there are people that attract the Angel
[14:02] that's right praise the Lord the angel
[14:05] came because Daniel was praying praise
[14:09] the Lord but Ram talks about the the two
[14:13] women that went to the meeting and came
[14:16] back from the meeting believing that God
[14:18] will heal them and because of their
[14:20] faith the angel passed in that
[14:23] neighborhood so that's what I believe
[14:27] that uh the angel is is attracted to a
[14:30] people the angeled is attracted to a
[14:33] believing group of people a people that
[14:36] take God at his word people that are
[14:39] holding to God's
[14:41] promise the Bible says the angels of the
[14:44] Lord are Inc come about them that fear
[14:46] Him Praise the Lord so uh uh I want us
[14:52] to prayed in just with the the few
[14:56] things we've been sharing with you that
[14:58] is happening in our in our city in our
[15:01] neighborhood we want to bring that to
[15:03] the Lord that uh uh he will be so
[15:07] attracted to to us to the word that is
[15:10] preached to the atmosphere that is
[15:12] created that the angel of the Lord will
[15:14] come and pass in our neighborhood
[15:17] brother baham says you want the angel to
[15:18] visit your house there is an attitude
[15:21] that you have to take amen you want the
[15:23] angel to visit your your life there is
[15:25] an attitude and an atmosphere you have
[15:28] to create that's what attract the angel
[15:31] you know the angels are attracted to the
[15:33] word praise the Lord and uh so he says
[15:37] uh I have seen where women and men who
[15:40] wait for weeks and the first thing you
[15:43] know all I wants it happened the angel
[15:47] passing through the neighborhood he
[15:49] knows where it's at amen he knows where
[15:52] we are he knows that we are gathered yet
[15:55] tonight amen praise the Lord and that's
[15:58] and that is the kind of a expectation I
[16:01] want us to to uh uh create in our heart
[16:05] and and uh that uh whether you are at
[16:08] home whether you at church or you are at
[16:10] work you have to know that uh you have
[16:14] in you what it takes to attract the
[16:16] angel praise the Lord amen he knows
[16:20] where is at whatsoever you B on Earth I
[16:24] will bur in heaven what you lose on
[16:27] Earth I will lose in heaven is is that
[16:29] right that's his sovereignty

[17:13] the manner of conversation we get
[17:15] ourself in getting away from all the
[17:18] gossip the way we represent the word by

[18:12] instruction how to dress ourself how to
[18:14] behave ourself praise the Lord so we
[18:17] want to thank the Lord today tonight the
[18:19] next one I will read and if the and if
[18:22] the Christian church today will only
[18:24] think in their heart that God that uh

[19:44] the Lord with Thanksgiving for giving us
[19:46] another
[19:47] opportunity to come in the house of the

[19:55] again want to place ourself before him
[19:57] and and ask to Lord to to just uh
[20:01] continue to deal with our hearts
[20:03] continue to deal with our life we want
[20:05] to pray again uh uh that uh the angel of
[20:10] the Lord will pass through our
[20:13] neighborhood since I believe that we can
[20:16] create such an
[20:17] atmosphere and uh uh with with all the
[20:20] ches I mean the cares around the city of
[20:23] Minneapolis is overwhelming the police
[20:26] the police are overwhelmed but I believe
[20:29] because of the presence of a group of
[20:31] people that is praying a group of people
[20:34] that is uh dedicating and concentrating
[20:37] himself to the Lord and uh we believe
[20:40] that God can can visit our neighborhood
[20:42] not only to stop the chaos but he can
[20:45] also visit our neighborhood and speak to
[20:48] to people in their homes and and and and
[20:51] and bring conviction to their home and
[20:53] and and and pick them up from your bed
[20:55] and uh uh uh uh God that's that's the
[20:59] kind of a God that we are we are serving
[21:02] I believe they they are the I still
[21:05] believe there is an IL one or two that
[21:08] is stay in the setting I believe there
[21:10] are people that are that that that
[21:12] wanting a reality of God people that are
[21:15] so tired with church denomination they
[21:18] really want God they don't know where to
[21:20] find him I believe when the angel visit
[21:23] our neighborhood he can give people
[21:26] addresses and so I just I just want us
[21:28] to pray tonight and again let's just uh
[21:31] commit our assembly in the hands of the
[21:33] Lord let's pray that uh for all our our
[21:36] preaching brothers let's pray for our

[51:01] PowerHouse of his internal thought and
[51:03] jeremi that God could tell Jeremiah
[51:06] before I formed the in your B so it's a
[51:09] sign that in this life if God your
[51:14] parents how do they come together maybe
[51:16] they were in different states or
[51:18] different region how do they come
[51:20] together before they they come together
[51:21] husband and wife up they meet before you
[51:24] come Hallelujah IM is a great God that
[51:27] organiz everything because you don't
[51:29] know God tell your parents that bring
[51:32] you but he said before I form you
[51:36] Hallelujah so you know that if God said
[51:38] before I form before before you are form

[52:35] you are here for a purpose it mean that
[52:37] you are not here by chance so you must
[52:40] always know that it's a purpose and when
[52:42] God bringing you up when you bring
[52:44] Jeremiah there Hallelujah and hey ordain
[52:48] you as a prophet to the nation so God
[52:51] orain every one of us for a peculiar
[52:54] purpose

[53:37] it's God work and it's God in it all
[53:41] it's not you that go Jeremiah only

[53:48] Moses when Moses the St I canot go say
