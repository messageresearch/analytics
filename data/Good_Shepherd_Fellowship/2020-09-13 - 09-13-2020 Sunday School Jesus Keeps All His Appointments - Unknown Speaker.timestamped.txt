[1:58] sake for we asked it in jesus name
[2:06] amen
[2:08] well it's certainly good to be back at
[2:10] the
[2:12] at the auditorium again tonight and
[2:15] under great expectations for the lord to
[2:17] visit us tonight
[2:18] as we've set this night aside from
[2:20] praying for the sick
[2:22] to the to seeking
[2:25] salvation for our souls each one of us
[2:29] needs to
[2:30] rededicate our lives anew and this
[2:33] week we have seen the presence of jesus
[2:36] christ
[2:37] the vindicated scripture him right here
[2:40] among us
[2:40] watching what he did the same things
[2:43] that he did on earth when he was here
[2:44] before
[2:45] he doing it just the same have we seen
[2:48] the ministry as it's climbing
[2:51] just like we're growing into a perfect
[2:54] day
[2:55] a perfect church we started out
[2:59] just like like we were saying this
[3:01] morning in our lovely little fellowship
[3:03] this morning we certainly had a
[3:05] wonderful time at that breakfast i think
[3:06] the brethren
[3:07] for their fine cooperation i got to
[3:10] shake the hands of many of them
[3:12] these fine man that's sponsoring this
[3:14] meeting
[3:15] uh bringing us in here it shows that
[3:18] they're interested in their people
[3:19] they're shepherds and
[3:21] interested in their sheep and so i'm i'm
[3:23] grateful that
[3:25] some of these uh any shepherd is
[3:27] interested in getting his sheep
[3:30] with vitamins and these are spiritual
[3:33] vitamins as it was it
[3:34] helps the sheep to grow into strong
[3:37] faith
[3:38] in our god and so i appreciate such man
[3:42] and now speaking this morning on a
[3:45] thought
[3:46] of the church growing see coming like a
[3:49] seed in the ground
[3:51] and that seed as this plant it grows
[3:53] from glory
[3:54] unto glory and it becomes after a while
[3:58] into a blossom
[4:00] and then goes back to the seed that's
[4:02] like the original seed that was planted
[4:05] and so has the church been the church
[4:08] age started in this last days
[4:10] after the dark ages it started with
[4:12] martin luther
[4:13] in the reformation preaching
[4:15] justification by faith
[4:17] after his time and they organized the
[4:19] church it died out
[4:21] and then there comes swingly after
[4:23] lutheran swing they didn't even believe
[4:25] in the virgin birth he went over into
[4:27] switzerland they still don't believe and
[4:29] the swingly doctrine do not believe that
[4:31] jesus was virgin born
[4:33] they said he was the son of joseph call
[4:35] the son of god
[4:36] but that takes the whole prophet from
[4:39] under
[4:39] the whole foundation of christianity he
[4:42] was virgin born
[4:43] or he is just a man like you or i he was
[4:46] the son of god and then after that come
[4:49] calvin and on and on
[4:50] finally the church got in such a
[4:52] condition their kind had to have another
[4:54] reformation
[4:55] and god sent john wesley with a message
[4:57] of sanctification
[4:59] cleansiness of the spirit and then
[5:02] he and whitfield and many of them went
[5:05] on in the great reformation and asbury
[5:08] that comes in the united states and that
[5:09] great revival saved england
[5:12] and the world at that time what did they
[5:14] do after them founders died out
[5:16] they began to organize upon their
[5:18] doctrine and the first thing you know
[5:19] they made an organization
[5:21] then we had others break off america
[5:23] such as alexander campbell john smith
[5:25] from the baptist church and
[5:26] so forth and then the nazarene pilgrim
[5:28] holiness and others come on and then
[5:30] come the great reformation again
[5:32] pentecost coming out of those
[5:33] organizations with the restoration of
[5:35] the gifts
[5:36] speaking in tongues divine healing great
[5:39] miracles and signs come off
[5:40] that went for a long time it's been 50
[5:43] about 58 years now
[5:45] since the holy spirit began to fall on
[5:46] old azusa street
[5:48] out in california you're in the united
[5:49] states where it started falling the
[5:51] great
[5:52] time come then what did pentecost do one
[5:54] made him an organization one said he's
[5:56] coming on a white horse
[5:57] another in a white cloud and a way they
[5:59] went organizations and split up
[6:02] breaking up the brotherhood among the
[6:04] people and just like
[6:05] israel little did israel know that when
[6:08] they were shouting the victory on the
[6:10] bank
[6:11] of the river they were only about four
[6:14] days journey about 40 miles
[6:16] away from the promised land they didn't
[6:18] realize they were
[6:20] 40 years it would take them but what was
[6:22] it
[6:23] grace had provided them a prophet a
[6:26] pillar of fire
[6:27] a sacrificed land a deliverance and
[6:30] still
[6:31] they wanted a law they wanted something
[6:33] they could have something to do into
[6:34] they want to put their hands to it
[6:36] that's the most rational mistake they
[6:38] ever made
[6:39] in exodus 19 when israel rejected grace
[6:42] and accepted law and then what did they
[6:45] do
[6:46] he just let them stay right there in the
[6:48] wilderness for 40 years
[6:50] they plant vineyards and they eat fruit
[6:53] and they married wives
[6:54] they raised children until that old
[6:56] generation died off
[6:58] and another generation come on 40 years
[7:01] later and not hardly 40 hours away
[7:04] but had to wait for 40 years before they
[7:07] went over and then a new leader came in
[7:09] joshua and they moved on into the land
[7:12] with the new group
[7:13] now i think it's a very beautiful type
[7:16] here
[7:16] that we find out long ago when our
[7:19] forefathers in the pentecost
[7:21] they raised up they had the old general
[7:23] counsel from that form of the assemblies
[7:25] of god
[7:25] out of that come the ubc and then united
[7:28] and so forth through
[7:29] got an organization after organizations
[7:31] fussing and fighting
[7:32] god just let them sit right there merry
[7:35] wives
[7:36] raise children speak in tongues shout
[7:39] the spirit
[7:40] but now there's a new group come up
[7:43] they were only just a few days from the
[7:45] promised land
[7:46] all these blessings they had was fine
[7:49] but you remember the whole land belonged
[7:51] to them
[7:52] now we're fixing to go into the promised
[7:54] land so may the lord help us as we look
[7:57] upon these things
[7:59] just like the pyramid did you notice how
[8:01] the pyramid was made
[8:03] not a pyramid doctrine now mr pyramid
[8:06] look on your one dollar bill the seal of
[8:09] the united states is that eagle
[8:10] well why does this say over there on the
[8:12] pier made the great seal
[8:14] why would it be greater here in the
[8:16] united states and and the seal of the
[8:18] united states
[8:19] the great seal the eye watching
[8:22] and the the capstone that goes upon the
[8:25] pyramid
[8:26] was it was rejected it never was
[8:29] on the pyramid isn't to this day
[8:33] the stone of scrolling they claimed but
[8:35] it never was put on the capstone why
[8:38] on enoch and them in the early days
[8:40] built the pyramids
[8:41] down in egypt we find out that in there
[8:43] they knew that the cornerstone of the
[8:45] capstone would
[8:46] be rejected and that pyramid is put so
[8:49] perfectly together too they don't need
[8:51] martyr
[8:52] it was so mechanically hewed out until
[8:55] one stone fits against the other so
[8:57] tight you can't even put a razor blade
[8:58] between them
[9:01] now it's kept creeping up and now it's
[9:04] all
[9:04] honed off on top ready for the capstone
[9:07] when it will
[9:08] come that's the way god's brought his
[9:09] church from justification
[9:12] sanctification baptism the holy spirit
[9:14] and now the ministry
[9:16] of the spirit which is the what quickens
[9:20] the word
[9:21] that ministry in the church will have to
[9:22] be just exactly like this
[9:25] just like this when my shadow here of my
[9:27] hand
[9:28] if i never see my hand seen the shadow
[9:30] it's kind of
[9:31] it gets pale as it gets away but it gets
[9:34] closer and closer
[9:35] the negative and positive are coming
[9:37] together until they both become the same
[9:38] thing
[9:39] and that's exactly when the church and
[9:41] the word has to be one like
[9:43] jesus and god was one just exactly the
[9:46] god has was in christ reconciling the
[9:49] world to himself
[9:50] and so will christ have to be in the
[9:52] church the anointed of the word
[9:54] to make everything fulfilled and that's
[9:56] a capstone that comes upon
[9:58] the last church age the not the lady
[10:01] will see it now it's a calling out of
[10:03] that
[10:03] a bride out of a church church out of a
[10:06] church and otherwise
[10:07] it's like he called a nation out of a
[10:09] nation in egypt
[10:10] and now we're living in that day and
[10:13] we're grateful for these great things
[10:15] that we've been seeing now tomorrow
[10:17] afternoon the lord willing
[10:19] is going to be the closing of this
[10:21] service uh
[10:22] this part of the service and we're going
[10:25] to
[10:26] designate that all together for praying
[10:28] for the sick
[10:29] and everybody that wants to be prayed
[10:31] for may come out and get a prayer card
[10:33] to come through the prayer line now the
[10:35] reason we get prayer cards on these is
[10:37] keep them lined up
[10:38] and then if you don't they just keep
[10:39] passing around around around and see if
[10:41] they
[10:41] so you we give them a prayer card you
[10:43] have a prayer card you come in the line
[10:45] and
[10:46] you'll see and believe you'll see the
[10:48] glory of god take place
[10:50] it'll be great and now we thank you for
[10:53] all that you have done and for the
[10:55] great welcome that we've had amongst
[10:57] these ministry brothers and so forth

[11:14] has come down from my hometown
[11:16] um here to be with us now these are the
[11:19] man that sponsors
[11:21] this meeting they believe this type of
[11:24] meeting
[11:24] if i lived here in this city i'd belong
[11:28] to one of their churches
[11:29] i certainly would because they believe
[11:31] the same thing that i believe and i
[11:32] belong to one of their churches if i
[11:34] lived here
[11:35] and you gave your life to christ this
[11:37] week and you don't have a church home
[11:39] why don't you talk it over with them
[11:41] they believe this same thing
[11:43] or they wouldn't be sitting up here
[11:45] represented see so now you
[11:47] you you find your nice one these nice
[11:49] churches tomorrow
[11:50] and go to it and i'm sure they'll do you
[11:53] good they'll help you
[11:54] they'll help you to believe it if you
[11:55] haven't been baptized ask them if you
[11:57] haven't received the holy ghost
[11:59] ask them about it and they'll help you
[12:01] right on through to christ and shepherd
[12:03] you right on down the road
[12:04] until he returns now the lord bless each
[12:07] one of you
[12:08] and now you know the presbyterians are
[12:11] always
[12:12] raising up and setting down they say and
[12:15] i'm not a presbyterian
[12:16] but i do believe that when we read the
[12:18] word we ought to stand
[12:20] because it's an honor to god to stand is
[12:22] like we salute the flag or
[12:24] pledge allegiance or what more and now
[12:27] for tonight i have chosen some scripture
[12:29] reading here
[12:30] out of the book of saint luke the
[12:32] seventh chapter beginning with the 36th
[12:34] verse
[12:36] and now all week long i've been working
[12:39] on a
[12:39] a thought that come to me on the road
[12:42] coming down here
[12:43] on the unveiling of the
[12:47] mighty god but when i got through
[12:49] looking at
[12:50] my scriptures and things i had nearly 20
[12:52] pages
[12:53] so i never get through that no hour here
[12:56] so i thought i'd have to change it
[12:57] tonight so i have
[13:00] i believe it's will of the lord and i
[13:02] say these things
[13:03] now in seventh chapter of saint luke and
[13:06] the 36th verse
[13:08] one of the pharisees desired him that he
[13:11] would
[13:11] eat with him and he went into the
[13:14] pharisees house and sat down to meet
[13:17] and behold a woman in the city which was
[13:20] a sinner
[13:22] when she knew that jesus sat at meat in
[13:25] the pharisees house
[13:26] brought an ambassador box of ointment
[13:29] and stood at his feet behind him weeping
[13:33] and began to wash his feet with tears
[13:36] and did wipe them with the hairs
[13:39] of her head and kissed his feet and
[13:42] anointed them with the ointment now when
[13:45] the pharisee
[13:47] which had been him saw it he spake
[13:50] within himself
[13:54] remember not out loud within himself
[13:56] saying
[13:57] if this man was a prophet he would know
[14:02] who and what manner of woman this is
[14:04] that
[14:05] touched him for she is a sinner
[14:09] and jesus answered and said unto him
[14:11] simon
[14:13] i have somewhat to say unto thee and he
[14:17] said master sayon
[14:20] there was a certain creditor
[14:23] which had two debtors and
[14:27] they owed one owed 500 pence
[14:30] and the other 50 and when they had
[14:33] nothing to pay
[14:35] he frankly forgave them both
[14:38] tell me therefore which of them will
[14:41] love him
[14:41] most simon answered and said
[14:45] i suppose that he to whom he forgave the
[14:48] most
[14:49] and he said unto him thou as rightly
[14:51] judged
[14:53] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[14:55] simon
[14:57] seest thou this woman i entered into thy
[15:01] house
[15:02] thou giveth me no water for my feet
[15:05] but she has washed my feet with tears
[15:09] and has wiped them with the hairs of her
[15:11] head
[15:12] and thou giveth me no kiss but this
[15:15] woman since the time
[15:16] i came in has not ceased to kiss my feet
[15:21] my head with all thou didst not anoint
[15:24] but this woman
[15:25] has a anointed my feet with oral
[15:29] wherefore i say unto her
[15:32] i say unto thee her sins which were many
[15:36] are forgiven for she loved much
[15:40] but to whom little is forgiven
[15:43] the same loveth a little and he said
[15:46] unto her
[15:47] thy sins are forgiven and they that set
[15:50] at me
[15:50] with him begin to say within themselves
[15:55] who is this that forgive us sins
[15:58] also and he said to the woman thy faith
[16:01] is say thee
[16:02] go in peace let us pray
[16:06] lord jesus this story
[16:10] has taken place many years ago
[16:14] but it's a true story for it is written
[16:17] in the pages of our bible and we know
[16:21] that it's true and now
[16:24] we would by no means try to portray this
[16:28] again tonight but we would like
[16:31] for you to help us to bring
[16:34] this as a message tonight to the people
[16:39] that they might see that
[16:42] that you're still the same lord jesus
[16:46] and we pray for your blessings upon us
[16:48] all as we are needy people
[16:51] we have need of the lord and
[16:54] we believe tonight though we see you
[16:58] make the blind to see and the deaf to
[17:01] hear
[17:01] and the lame to walk and by doctor's
[17:05] statements i've seen you
[17:06] raise up five people from the dead
[17:10] in different times different nations
[17:14] but yet lord i believe the most sickest
[17:17] thing i know of tonight
[17:18] is the body of christ here on earth

[19:42] i want you to bear that on mine as we
[19:44] speak
[19:45] and i i won't talk too long
[19:48] and i want you to think it over now that
[19:51] remember you've got to meet this one
[19:52] that's present with us tonight
[19:54] someday now it must have been
[19:59] almost sundown when our sitting
[20:02] starts out tonight it must have been
[20:04] about sundown
[20:07] and this courier had run all day
[20:11] maybe two or three days he was trying to
[20:13] find him he went down
[20:15] maybe almost from dan to besheba
[20:19] because jesus in his ministry was
[20:22] going to speak here perform his
[20:26] signs and wonders and the people are all
[20:28] together
[20:29] he would take off somewhere else i must
[20:31] go to another city
[20:33] and it had a hard time perhaps it went
[20:36] over to capernaum and
[20:38] they said well he left here a week ago
[20:40] we don't know exactly where he went but
[20:42] he went somewhere else and he oh he was
[20:45] tired
[20:46] his hair was wet was perspiration his
[20:50] legs were dusty and sweaty
[20:53] and as he come up into the party
[20:56] where jesus had been speaking
[20:59] and jesus also was tired he'd been
[21:02] speaking all day his mouth was dry
[21:05] from much speaking and his hands began
[21:08] to
[21:08] look trembling and his eyes weary as the
[21:11] sun
[21:11] began to sink and
[21:15] he wanted to see jesus he had a message
[21:19] for him
[21:20] and now jesus had 12 men around him that
[21:22] kept the people
[21:23] away from him uh of course he just
[21:26] coming up on him and so they i'm making
[21:29] this in a drama so that everybody can
[21:31] catch it
[21:32] and so we find that in this
[21:35] jesus man he must have come let's say he
[21:38] come to philip
[21:40] and philip might have said something
[21:41] like this a sir or young fella
[21:44] we would certainly like to let you see
[21:47] the master but
[21:48] but he's so tired we just got to watch
[21:51] him because he
[21:53] he just goes to the almost drops and
[21:55] we've been in so many meetings and so
[21:57] forth lately
[21:59] i'm sorry i don't believe we can do it
[22:01] but he says i
[22:02] i have a note here that comes from a
[22:05] very
[22:06] important man in religious realms
[22:09] and it's an invitation for your master
[22:12] which will be a great
[22:13] a great thing if if he shall go and i'm
[22:16] a scene because i've been
[22:18] commissioned that i must take this note
[22:21] to him and see
[22:22] that he gets it personally so finally
[22:26] if they tuck him up to the lord jesus
[22:29] and
[22:29] while he was uh looking at him the lord
[22:31] jesus perhaps
[22:32] leaving his place pulpit from where he
[22:34] was speaking or the disciples and them
[22:36] had fixed for him to talk from
[22:38] as he was looking why he looked upon the
[22:41] young man he must have
[22:43] liked him and the young man told him he
[22:45] said
[22:46] i am on a errand sir
[22:49] and there's a very high
[22:52] ranking man down in a certain city
[22:56] and he's a pharisee the strictest of the
[22:58] religions
[23:00] and he's uh he's making a dinner
[23:03] a great uh time of banquet
[23:06] and he wants you to come to be the guest
[23:09] of honor
[23:11] and he's uh manny would like to attain
[23:13] this banquet
[23:14] but he has selected you and i've been
[23:17] three days
[23:18] trying to find you across the country
[23:21] and i was certainly happy to get your
[23:22] sir
[23:23] i'll deliver this note to you from it
[23:25] and
[23:26] from him and he took the note and read
[23:28] it and you find out that this
[23:30] certain pharisee had was making a feast
[23:33] and
[23:33] and had bid him to come down and be a
[23:35] guest of honor with him
[23:37] so jesus standing for a few moments and
[23:40] looking at the young man
[23:42] and yet as busy as he was
[23:46] but you can never invite him but what
[23:48] he'll come
[23:49] i don't care what the situation is he'll
[23:51] come
[23:53] he uh said you tell your your master
[23:57] that i'll be there on this certain day
[24:00] at this certain time i'll be there and
[24:03] the courier
[24:04] must have smile satisfied and turned
[24:07] away and run off down the hill to take
[24:09] the good news back to his master
[24:11] that he had succeeded in getting the
[24:13] message to this one
[24:14] that he wanted what was the matter with
[24:18] that courier
[24:20] how could it be
[24:23] was he conscious of what he done
[24:27] the first time maybe in his life that he
[24:30] ever
[24:30] stood in the presence of jesus
[24:34] and never even asked forgiveness of his
[24:36] sins
[24:37] he never he never took the opportunity
[24:41] oh how it's the same way with people
[24:46] today many times they they're realize
[24:48] that they're in his presence and
[24:50] and never ask forgiveness well that
[24:54] he maybe never presented the opportunity
[24:56] another time and turned
[24:58] down his last opportunity to ask
[25:01] forgiveness
[25:02] how could he ever have done that how
[25:06] could this boy ever so been
[25:08] wrapped up and bringing this message
[25:11] from his master
[25:12] that he failed in the presence of the
[25:15] son of god
[25:16] that asked forgiveness it was all a
[25:18] business affair
[25:21] and you know that's something like the
[25:23] people today
[25:24] church christ has become a a
[25:28] business affair or or social affair
[25:32] to john church and get just a a a little
[25:35] better social standing for
[25:37] your business or something to stand out
[25:40] a little better in the neighborhood it
[25:41] is the thing
[25:42] of of really coming and repenting like a
[25:45] sinner should do
[25:48] many times in church people are brought
[25:50] right in the presence of christ
[25:52] and turn away and do his rational thing
[25:55] as this
[25:56] courier uh did
[26:00] oh he should have fell upon his knees
[26:01] and when he first realized
[26:04] that it was who he was and he's saying
[26:07] master i have a message for you but
[26:10] first
[26:10] i want you to forgive me that would have
[26:13] been the right approach
[26:15] and then if there's any business to be
[26:16] done let that be done later but to first
[26:18] get his own soul right with god
[26:22] that's why i think so much healing
[26:24] becomes a failure
[26:26] or professed healing because the first
[26:28] place the people are not ready for
[26:30] healing they won't confess they're wrong
[26:33] the bible said confess your faults one
[26:36] to another and pray one for the
[26:38] other and we're not willing to do that
[26:40] if we can take the healing and
[26:42] go ahead and go on back and do what we
[26:44] was doing
[26:45] they would accept that but when it comes
[26:47] to really
[26:48] first coming and getting right with god
[26:50] people don't want to do that
[26:52] and that's the reason it throws a a bad
[26:55] a damper over divine healing you see so
[26:58] many people that
[26:59] walk in like it and walk out and don't
[27:01] and god knows all about those things
[27:04] now this fellow made a real rational
[27:07] thing we would think
[27:08] we would think if i could only take his
[27:11] place
[27:12] if i could go up before his throne and
[27:14] and take a message
[27:15] the first thing i would do what would
[27:17] you do be interested in what your
[27:18] organization has sent you up there to
[27:20] find out about
[27:24] or would you be looking around and see
[27:25] how heaven was decorated or
[27:27] in his presence with the first thing you
[27:29] say lord god forgive me a sinner
[27:33] that would be the right thing to do
[27:36] now as jesus watched the boy and
[27:40] as he went away might come in his mind
[27:43] why didn't that boy do that
[27:45] was because he wasn't conscious who that
[27:48] was
[27:51] may i say this not sacrilegious may i
[27:54] say this not because it's this meeting
[27:57] or any meeting but i think that's what's
[27:59] the matter today
[28:00] people are not conscious of it
[28:04] they see the scripture exactly
[28:07] identified
[28:08] but they're not conscious of who it is
[28:11] they'll see something and they say
[28:13] oh that was wonderful that was fun but
[28:16] you're not conscious of what it is
[28:19] if it was there'd be a repentance going
[28:22] on weeping and crying
[28:24] the city would have such a revival to
[28:26] half of you be locked up before morning
[28:29] it's right if we be
[28:31] conscious of what it is and we pass by
[28:34] many times
[28:35] and miss the opportunity but not being
[28:38] conscious i don't think the boy really
[28:39] realized
[28:40] he'd been raised up among this pharisee
[28:42] which was a a
[28:44] great ruler a prince or a religious man
[28:47] and he had been raised up with him and
[28:50] and just took his side of religion
[28:52] and the pharisee had laughed at jesus
[28:54] and made fun of him or something they
[28:56] did as they
[28:57] in that day
[29:29] [Music]
[30:19] you
