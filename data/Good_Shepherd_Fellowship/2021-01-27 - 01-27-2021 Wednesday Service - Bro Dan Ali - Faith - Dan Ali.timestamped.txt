[53:22] musicians god bless you all come please
[53:25] take your seat
[53:35] while we are still standing can we reach
[53:37] out for our bibles
[53:58] hebrews 11
[54:03] 11 1
[54:07] now faith is the substance of things
[54:09] hoped for
[54:11] the evidence of things not seen
[54:14] for by it the elders obtained a good
[54:17] report
[54:18] through faith we understand that the
[54:21] worlds were framed
[54:22] by the word of god so that things
[54:25] which are seen were not made of
[54:28] things which do appear by faith
[54:32] abel offered unto god a more excellent
[54:34] sacrifice
[54:35] than cain by which he obtained witness
[54:39] that he was righteous god testifying of
[54:43] his gifts
[54:44] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[54:48] by faith enoch was translated
[54:52] that he should not see death and was not
[54:55] found
[54:56] because god had translated him
[55:00] for before his translation he had this
[55:03] testimony
[55:05] that he pleased god but without faith
[55:09] it is impossible to please him for he
[55:12] that cometh
[55:14] to god must believe that he is and that
[55:17] he is a rewarder of them that diligently
[55:21] seek him
[55:22] praise be to god shall we be seated
[55:36] our lord and our master jesus
[55:41] we thank you for having ahead and
[55:42] answered our prayers already
[55:46] for we know whenever we open our mouths
[55:51] that there is a god who is listening yes
[55:54] you have never let us down you have been
[55:58] faithful
[55:59] you have kept your word of promise
[56:01] towards us
[56:02] and we are so grateful we praised you
[56:05] tonight
[56:06] we worship and we bless the father in
[56:09] jesus name
[56:10] may you come and honor yourself in our
[56:13] midst tonight
[56:14] and speak to us in jesus name amen
[56:20] praise be to god happy to see you guys
[56:22] once again
[56:24] it's always a joy to be in the house of
[56:27] the lord
[56:29] there is no better place to be
[56:32] other than gathering before his throne
[56:34] of grace
[56:36] now this book of hebrews we have just
[56:42] read
[56:44] talks about nothing but faith
[56:50] and as you continue to read on
[56:54] as we talk about abraham
[56:58] talks about noah
[57:01] and how god
[57:07] felt on it whenever
[57:10] faith was expressed by his children
[57:15] now when you get to hebrews 12
[57:19] verse 1 right after verse 11
[57:24] it talks about wherefore
[57:27] seeing we also are compassed about
[57:32] with so great a cloud of witnesses
[57:36] let us lay aside every weight
[57:40] and the sin which do have so easily
[57:43] beside us
[57:44] and let us run with patience the race
[57:49] that has been said before us praise be
[57:52] to god
[57:53] a race has been set before us
[57:57] and with patience let us run this race
[58:00] that has been set before us i
[58:04] loved running a lot when i was in school
[58:07] i loved taking to the tracks i was a
[58:10] very good athlete
[58:12] even though i didn't receive any honest
[58:15] but
[58:16] i loved it for very good reasons both in
[58:19] the tracks
[58:20] and outside of it because the faster i
[58:23] could run
[58:25] the better it was for me growing up i
[58:27] had a lot of challenges i was really a
[58:29] very very bad boy
[58:31] so but i loved
[58:36] athletics a lot
[58:39] and of all the races there are
[58:43] i would want to compare this
[58:46] race that has been said before us
[58:50] to the relay
[58:53] the relay you have someone run
[58:58] bring the stick sometimes i would forget
[59:02] and i'll say a button when i see a
[59:05] button no i'm talking about that stick
[59:08] that is what i know someone brings the
[59:11] baton
[59:13] to one person he takes it runs and gives
[59:16] another person
[59:17] and that is how it continues
[59:21] and i want to compare this race we are
[59:24] running
[59:25] this race that has been set before us to
[59:28] a relay
[59:32] there was a story about a woman
[59:37] that appeared in a competition
[59:42] and they had prepared for this
[59:43] competition so well and they were
[59:46] determined
[59:48] to take a price
[59:51] and she was the last in the set
[59:55] to finish the race
[59:59] the first person who ran ran the race in
[1:00:02] a very good time
[1:00:04] it was four by four hundred in other
[1:00:06] words you go around the field once
[1:00:08] and then you hand over the baton to the
[1:00:09] next person and then she was the last
[1:00:12] person
[1:00:13] as soon as she took the baton
[1:00:17] something happened and then she fell
[1:00:19] flat on her face
[1:00:22] and she sustained bruised in her hands
[1:00:25] and
[1:00:26] on her knees and when she got up
[1:00:30] she felt so badly that she did not even
[1:00:32] see where the button was
[1:00:35] and as she turned looking for it
[1:00:38] one of the athletes just ran took the
[1:00:41] baton and handed it over to her
[1:00:43] at that point you would think that it
[1:00:46] was
[1:00:46] over of course
[1:00:50] everybody goes in the competition to win
[1:00:53] a medal
[1:00:54] at this point she was last
[1:00:57] to say the list there was no way she
[1:01:00] could catch up
[1:01:01] so the easiest thing for her to have
[1:01:03] done was to call it quit
[1:01:07] but she didn't do that she took the
[1:01:10] baton
[1:01:11] and she started limping and running
[1:01:14] and she was crying and she was bleeding
[1:01:17] and she was just running and bleeding
[1:01:20] saying to herself
[1:01:21] oh how i have let my people down we have
[1:01:25] left home
[1:01:26] thousands of miles to come for this
[1:01:28] competition
[1:01:30] we have left daddy we have left mommy we
[1:01:32] have left our friends
[1:01:33] for this competition we have been
[1:01:36] training for this competition
[1:01:37] for a year now and we are poised to have
[1:01:41] won this
[1:01:41] competition i have messed it up
[1:01:44] and yet she wouldn't give up she was
[1:01:47] running
[1:01:48] and thinking to herself oh how she maybe
[1:01:51] how the police were disappointed
[1:01:53] how she let them down and how they were
[1:01:56] probably going to meet her
[1:01:58] and then vent their anger on her but she
[1:02:01] still never gave
[1:02:02] up she was running limping
[1:02:06] crying as she inched towards
[1:02:09] the cross i mean the finish line
[1:02:13] and as she was just getting there and
[1:02:15] crossing the line
[1:02:17] her colleagues were there and as she was
[1:02:20] whipping
[1:02:21] they just rallied around her put their
[1:02:23] arms around her
[1:02:24] and said no do not cry it was meant to
[1:02:27] be
[1:02:27] they started encouraging her she was
[1:02:30] whipping she said i'm sorry i
[1:02:31] disappointed
[1:02:32] they said no don't worry about it and
[1:02:34] then
[1:02:35] not only what did she receive praise
[1:02:41] from the people that came to support
[1:02:43] them
[1:02:44] but she had a standing ovation
[1:02:48] from almost everybody that was at the
[1:02:50] stadium
[1:02:52] praise be to god and when i look at the
[1:02:55] race that we are running
[1:02:57] i couldn't compare it to anything but to
[1:02:59] the relay
[1:03:01] when you think about this race we are
[1:03:03] running
[1:03:04] and you think of how we have gotten to
[1:03:06] this point
[1:03:07] how many people have lost their lives to
[1:03:10] get
[1:03:10] this message to you that sometimes you
[1:03:13] feel so
[1:03:14] down and out you feel so discouraged
[1:03:18] but yet when you think of how people
[1:03:22] were fed to the lions
[1:03:23] and yet they would not give up
[1:03:27] people refused to live so they could
[1:03:29] hand this button over to you
[1:03:32] people were imprisoned so they could
[1:03:34] hand this button over to you
[1:03:38] then you know that the message will have
[1:03:41] believed
[1:03:42] the word of god is dripping with blood
[1:03:45] and when you
[1:03:45] think about it alone
[1:03:49] it's difficult to quit
[1:03:53] you stay in your course you may be
[1:03:55] limping
[1:03:56] you may be crying
[1:03:59] but the good thing about this race we
[1:04:01] are running
[1:04:03] is that there is a murder for everybody
[1:04:06] that crosses the line
[1:04:08] praise be to god the miracle is not only
[1:04:11] result in the first second and tenth
[1:04:13] but whoever crosses the line there is a
[1:04:16] medal for you
[1:04:17] praise be to god amen
[1:04:24] so we are running a race and when i talk
[1:04:27] about
[1:04:27] it what on earth would make a woman
[1:04:32] or would make somebody that is given the
[1:04:35] option to live
[1:04:36] and yet would choose to die for what
[1:04:38] they believe to
[1:04:40] be the truth
[1:04:43] then i know that it has to do with faith
[1:04:48] faith and tonight we are going to talk
[1:04:51] about
[1:04:52] faith amen praise be to god
[1:04:56] faith
[1:05:06] now faith
[1:05:10] the substance of things hopeful the
[1:05:13] evidence of things not seen
[1:05:18] the only way the
[1:05:21] only way to get faith is by the word
[1:05:27] there is no other way around it
[1:05:34] faith coming by hearing and hearing by
[1:05:37] the word of god
[1:05:40] there is no other way around it
[1:05:44] i used to think that miracles
[1:05:47] give faith but the brother said miracles
[1:05:51] don't give faith
[1:05:53] they only increase your faith
[1:05:56] so if there is no faith you will rejoice
[1:05:59] with the miracles
[1:06:01] and after that you go back to your
[1:06:03] arrows and live in that mess
[1:06:06] but if there is faith the first day it
[1:06:09] comes and it lifts you up
[1:06:11] praise be to god but the things that we
[1:06:14] know would give us faith
[1:06:16] how often do we do it
[1:06:21] sometimes we don't know where our bibles
[1:06:23] are until it is sunday
[1:06:25] or until this is wednesday and we are
[1:06:27] coming to church
[1:06:31] we hardly read our bibles
[1:06:36] we can spend our day
[1:06:39] playing games watching movies
[1:06:43] on the internet doing all sorts of
[1:06:46] things
[1:06:47] being on the chat line but when it comes
[1:06:51] to the word of god
[1:06:53] we have very little time
[1:06:56] and this is what is going to help us
[1:07:00] the things that do not help us they are
[1:07:02] the things that we spend time on
[1:07:04] but the things that we know
[1:07:08] would help us in our work with god we
[1:07:10] don't do them now sometimes we think
[1:07:15] that
[1:07:15] iniquity is knowing
[1:07:19] what you shouldn't do and then you
[1:07:22] doing it brother branham said
[1:07:26] that knowing what is right and failing
[1:07:29] to do it
[1:07:30] is also iniquity
[1:07:34] so when you know something is wrong and
[1:07:36] you do it
[1:07:38] it's iniquity and when you also know
[1:07:40] something is right
[1:07:42] and yet you will not do it it's iniquity
[1:07:51] knowing what is right to do and yet you
[1:07:53] will not do it
[1:07:55] for goodness sake why do we even come to
[1:07:57] church
[1:07:59] you come expecting god to speak to you
[1:08:01] god speaks
[1:08:02] and yet you will not act on it it was
[1:08:05] better you didn't even come
[1:08:10] praise be to god amen
[1:08:14] we are living in an age
[1:08:18] where there are a lot of voices calling
[1:08:20] for attention
[1:08:23] so the devil will make sure that the
[1:08:26] things that will help you
[1:08:27] you don't give hit to it
[1:08:32] he will keep you so busy
[1:08:35] working schooling cleaning cooking
[1:08:39] eating and the very thing that will help
[1:08:42] you you would not do it
[1:08:45] because he knows the more faith he has
[1:08:49] you have
[1:08:51] the less he has to deal with you
[1:08:57] because faith
[1:09:00] genuine faith rests on the word of god
[1:09:07] praise be to god we are talking about
[1:09:10] faith tonight
[1:09:12] and i'm taking this inspiration from the
[1:09:14] message the prophet preached
[1:09:16] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:09:18] for
[1:09:21] now we have talked about faith in this
[1:09:24] house
[1:09:25] a lot of times and i like the way the
[1:09:29] prophet put
[1:09:30] some of these things using the five
[1:09:33] natural senses
[1:09:35] i loved it on sunday when the lawyer put
[1:09:37] those
[1:09:38] the diagram was so beautiful i loved it
[1:09:41] it was very nice now
[1:09:44] there are five natural senses and the
[1:09:47] first sense of the spirit
[1:09:48] is just to help us contact this earth
[1:09:53] and the spiritual world but there is
[1:09:54] another world praise be to god
[1:09:57] we are not going into that tonight
[1:10:00] and i'm going to use the five natural
[1:10:02] senses
[1:10:04] to establish a foundation
[1:10:08] i'll keep within my time i'll not go
[1:10:12] even five minutes above
[1:10:14] praise be to god now
[1:10:20] faith has no substitute
[1:10:24] faith is a must
[1:10:28] it's a must
[1:10:31] there are there is no two ways about it
[1:10:35] for you to receive your healing you need
[1:10:37] faith
[1:10:39] for you to please god you need faith
[1:10:42] in for nothing at all i mean
[1:10:47] can you tell me what child
[1:10:50] of god you would be
[1:10:54] if your intention is not to please god
[1:11:00] if you have a different intention other
[1:11:03] than pleasing
[1:11:03] god i would want to know what that is
[1:11:08] for the bible says without faith no man
[1:11:10] can please god
[1:11:13] and every child of god wants to please
[1:11:15] god
[1:11:16] so faith is a must yes in your daily
[1:11:20] work with god you need
[1:11:21] faith if to to have daily victories you
[1:11:26] need faith
[1:11:29] so faith is a must it's not when you
[1:11:32] feel like it
[1:11:35] now i'm using the five natural senses
[1:11:41] to establish a ground here
[1:11:46] let's take our sense
[1:11:51] of sin now
[1:11:54] i can see that there is a wall clock
[1:11:57] over there
[1:11:59] i can see it there is
[1:12:02] no way you can tell me that i am not
[1:12:05] seeing it
[1:12:06] because i am looking at it
[1:12:10] it's definite
[1:12:14] i'm looking at the clock
[1:12:17] so there is no way you can convince me
[1:12:19] that i am not seeing the clock
[1:12:24] now those days
[1:12:30] we used to go fishing and sometimes
[1:12:34] um it rains and then the water fills the
[1:12:38] dam
[1:12:39] and then we go in and to catch mud fish
[1:12:41] i don't know how many of you know mad
[1:12:42] fish
[1:12:44] it's a very black big slippery fish
[1:12:48] and then we go into the muddy waters
[1:12:51] to catch them now you are in the muddy
[1:12:54] water up to west level
[1:12:56] and your hands are in the water you are
[1:12:58] not seeing beneath
[1:13:00] it's your hands which are down there and
[1:13:03] then you are just working your way
[1:13:04] through
[1:13:05] and sometimes you catch and it will miss
[1:13:07] and when you
[1:13:08] get grip of it you know you have caught
[1:13:10] it
[1:13:12] your eyes are not seen beneath the water
[1:13:16] you are not seeing it but there is
[1:13:20] another
[1:13:20] sense that is telling you that you have
[1:13:23] gotten a hold of it
[1:13:24] and there is nothing that will tell you
[1:13:26] that you are okay
[1:13:28] you have not caught it so i am holding
[1:13:31] the fish
[1:13:33] under it and i know i am holding it
[1:13:36] and my sense of touch is saying that yes
[1:13:39] you are holding the fish there is
[1:13:42] nothing in the world
[1:13:43] that can tell me otherwise because i
[1:13:46] know
[1:13:46] that i am holding it
[1:13:50] praise be to god
[1:13:53] when we move there
[1:13:59] when there is music playing
[1:14:03] my eyes do not see the sound
[1:14:10] i don't feel the sound but i have
[1:14:13] another sense
[1:14:15] which tells me that there is music
[1:14:18] playing
[1:14:19] because i can hear it
[1:14:22] and it is definite
[1:14:26] you couldn't convince me otherwise
[1:14:30] because i'm hearing it
[1:14:34] praise be to god
[1:14:39] you can put on a perfume in the house
[1:14:44] nobody is there with you but once you
[1:14:46] walk through the door
[1:14:49] another sense my sense of smell tells me
[1:14:54] that you are wearing a perfume
[1:14:57] my eyes are not seeing the smell my ears
[1:15:01] are not hearing the smell
[1:15:03] i am not feeling the smell but there is
[1:15:06] a sense
[1:15:07] that can tell me that you have put on a
[1:15:09] perfume
[1:15:12] praise be to god and so it is
[1:15:16] with taste
[1:15:21] so it is we taste
[1:15:24] now these are definite
[1:15:30] we are talking about faith tonight
[1:15:33] and faith is not a myth
[1:15:38] a definite sense
[1:15:41] you know when it is there and you know
[1:15:44] when it is not there
[1:15:46] you know whether you have it or not it
[1:15:49] is a
[1:15:50] definite sense
[1:15:53] it does not play on emotions
[1:15:59] the substance of things hopeful the
[1:16:02] evidence of this not seen if you are
[1:16:05] seeing it is sufficient
[1:16:08] if you can see it then there is no faith
[1:16:13] it's like you holding on to that fish in
[1:16:16] the muddy waters
[1:16:17] and your eyes are not seeing it but you
[1:16:20] know it is there
[1:16:22] that is what faith does that when faith
[1:16:25] has taken a hold of it
[1:16:27] even though the eyes are not saying it
[1:16:29] you know
[1:16:31] that by the grace of god you have caught
[1:16:33] it
[1:16:38] faith is a definite sense
[1:16:41] praise be to god
[1:16:46] faith
[1:16:48] the power of god said i don't know if
[1:16:50] i'm going ahead of myself but that is
[1:16:52] fine
[1:16:54] is the sixth sense
[1:16:58] it is the supersense
[1:17:02] it is superior to
[1:17:05] all the senses thank you there is
[1:17:08] nothing like it yes
[1:17:14] and even though my eyes are seeing
[1:17:17] something and you can't convince me it's
[1:17:19] not there
[1:17:20] sometimes their eyes would lie to you
[1:17:25] sometimes they lie to you sometimes your
[1:17:29] sense of touch
[1:17:30] would lie to you sometimes your sense of
[1:17:33] hearing
[1:17:33] will lie to you sometimes your sense of
[1:17:37] test
[1:17:37] would lie to you but faith would never
[1:17:40] lie to you
[1:17:43] and the problem of god has made us to
[1:17:45] understand that
[1:17:46] faith is more definite than all the
[1:17:49] senses
[1:17:52] but you know what our problems are
[1:17:54] sometimes
[1:17:56] we try to believe more in the taste we
[1:17:58] see
[1:18:00] we try to believe more in the things we
[1:18:02] hear
[1:18:07] if we can believe the natural senses
[1:18:10] which are inferior
[1:18:14] which are inferior to the spiritual
[1:18:17] sense
[1:18:19] to faith why can't we believe that
[1:18:24] why can't we believe they're spiritual
[1:18:29] because they are inferior and we believe
[1:18:31] in them
[1:18:33] but there is something that is by far
[1:18:36] higher
[1:18:37] and more superior than all the senses
[1:18:42] that we have in the natural ways
[1:18:47] so you don't have to see to believe
[1:18:51] because you know you're not spelling you
[1:18:53] are not seeing a perfume
[1:18:55] you are smelling it and you know it is
[1:18:57] there
[1:19:00] so why do you want to see before you
[1:19:02] believe
[1:19:05] why do you want to see before you
[1:19:07] believe
[1:19:12] sin is not believing
[1:19:20] you don't have to see it praise be to
[1:19:23] god praise the lord
[1:19:26] the lord jesus told thomas
[1:19:30] that because you have seen you have
[1:19:32] believed but blessed is he
[1:19:35] they have not seen but yet has believed
[1:19:38] thank you jesus if you can see it
[1:19:42] there is no faith but faith comes in
[1:19:47] when you don't see it
[1:19:51] but yet you know it is there it is not
[1:19:55] a guessing work you are not guessing it
[1:19:59] you are holding on to it you know it is
[1:20:02] there and nobody can tell you otherwise
[1:20:05] praise be to god that is what faith does
[1:20:09] it's a deathly sense
[1:20:14] praise god now
[1:20:18] some people think that positive
[1:20:21] thinking is faith positive thinking is
[1:20:24] no faith
[1:20:27] positive thinking is as good as it can
[1:20:29] be
[1:20:31] don't have to be a christian to think
[1:20:34] positively
[1:20:36] we have muslims who think positively
[1:20:39] we have um hindus
[1:20:42] there are people who don't even belong
[1:20:44] to any religion
[1:20:46] and they think positively
[1:20:51] and you can't serve god
[1:20:55] with positive thinking
[1:20:58] brother abraham said faith is positive
[1:21:02] it's positive but positive thinking
[1:21:05] is not faith
[1:21:09] it's good to be a positive thinker
[1:21:14] positive thinking is just you
[1:21:17] it's just your effort
[1:21:20] it's resting on your ability
[1:21:24] on logic
[1:21:27] adding one plus one giving you two
[1:21:30] and you can see you can see i mean
[1:21:33] something that makes sense to you
[1:21:38] that is not faith
[1:21:41] faith is positive
[1:21:45] but remember that positive thinking
[1:21:50] is not faith
[1:22:04] embryo goes on to talk about sometimes
[1:22:14] people have hope instead of
[1:22:18] faith
[1:22:22] and you think you have faith but you
[1:22:25] only have hope
[1:22:32] there are two different things here
[1:22:36] and i try to look out
[1:22:39] hope is a feeling of expectation
[1:22:43] just a feeling of expectation remember
[1:22:47] that faith has nothing to do with your
[1:22:50] feelings
[1:22:52] here hope is a feeling of expectation
[1:22:56] and a desire that something good is
[1:22:59] about to happen
[1:23:01] but what faith does faith takes out the
[1:23:05] feeling
[1:23:07] praise be to god it takes out the
[1:23:10] feeling
[1:23:12] and it replaces it with the word
[1:23:15] amen and you know that it is not your
[1:23:18] feeling
[1:23:19] you know that is that says the lord and
[1:23:21] as the prayer of god
[1:23:22] said that says the lord faileth not
[1:23:28] when you are sick and you are being
[1:23:29] prayed for
[1:23:33] you don't have to feel like you are
[1:23:35] getting well to receive your healing
[1:23:40] against all odds you would believe
[1:23:44] because it is the word of god
[1:23:48] it does not have to make sense to you
[1:23:51] if it makes sense to you
[1:23:54] then that is something else but against
[1:23:57] all us
[1:24:00] against all us
[1:24:03] you say believe that it is going to
[1:24:06] happen because the word of god says so
[1:24:08] praise be to god we are talking about
[1:24:12] faith tonight
[1:24:15] now there is something i want us to look
[1:24:18] at
[1:24:20] as we go down
[1:24:24] as the prophet god said there are two
[1:24:26] powers
[1:24:28] god and satan
[1:24:31] god oppressed with faith
[1:24:34] satan oppressed with fear
[1:24:38] so faith is a tool in the hands of god
[1:24:43] and fear is a true
[1:24:47] in the hands of satan
[1:24:51] now fear
[1:24:56] let me say this
[1:24:59] there are a lot of places in the bible
[1:25:00] where you see the fear of god the fear
[1:25:02] of god the fear of god
[1:25:04] that is not the type of fear i'm talking
[1:25:06] about
[1:25:08] i used to have one english tutor who
[1:25:10] told me
[1:25:12] that no word has a meaning
[1:25:15] that every word takes its meaning
[1:25:18] from the sentence the sentence in which
[1:25:21] it finds itself
[1:25:22] and that makes sense to me
[1:25:26] so the context
[1:25:29] in which you find that word tells you
[1:25:32] what that word means
[1:25:36] so fear here when the bible says fear
[1:25:41] god
[1:25:41] is just to stand in out of god
[1:25:44] is to reverence god
[1:25:49] so that is not the fear i am talking
[1:25:51] about here
[1:25:58] so know that there is a distinction here
[1:26:02] so the devil uses fear
[1:26:05] as is true of oppression
[1:26:10] praise be to god and when we talk of
[1:26:14] fear
[1:26:16] you know it's not like maybe you are
[1:26:18] driving on the highway and then you
[1:26:20] slide on a 10 sheet of ice
[1:26:22] and then you miss your heart beat that
[1:26:24] is not what i'm talking about
[1:26:29] or you find yourself in a very high
[1:26:31] tower and then you look down and
[1:26:33] you just that is not what i'm talking
[1:26:35] about
[1:26:41] but for you you know there are people
[1:26:44] that just have
[1:26:46] this fear of something bad going to
[1:26:49] happen at any time
[1:26:51] they fear every shadow that passes by
[1:26:54] and they fear their own shadow
[1:26:57] for every time they are thinking of
[1:26:59] something evil coming
[1:27:02] thinking of something right somebody
[1:27:03] coming after them
[1:27:06] the devil uses that too so
[1:27:09] much against the children of god and i
[1:27:12] would want us
[1:27:13] and you wonder fear
[1:27:19] as i try to look at the meaning
[1:27:22] is an unpleasant emotion and the word
[1:27:25] emotion here again
[1:27:27] feeling caused by the belief
[1:27:31] that something bad is going to happen
[1:27:35] and i became a little curious i said let
[1:27:37] me look at what the
[1:27:38] belief means belief means
[1:27:42] family health opinion
[1:27:46] or conviction that something
[1:27:50] bad is going to happen
[1:27:55] you are holding onto it firmly
[1:28:00] family
[1:28:03] you are convicted
[1:28:07] that something bad is going to happen
[1:28:11] in fact when i looked at it
[1:28:15] it was almost like
[1:28:18] looking at faith
[1:28:22] whereas faith is positive
[1:28:25] in this sense is negative
[1:28:34] because when faith is holding on to
[1:28:36] something
[1:28:38] it must surely come to pass
[1:28:42] and then think of it this way
[1:28:47] if i had my own way i would say fear
[1:28:50] is equal to negative fate or faith
[1:28:53] in reverse it's like you are expressing
[1:28:58] faith
[1:28:59] but negatively
[1:29:02] and you wonder why that
[1:29:06] fear fear is so so so strong
[1:29:11] it's a very strong weapon yes
[1:29:15] and you have to fight fear the way you
[1:29:19] would fight
[1:29:19] cancer if you were ever told you have it
[1:29:25] it's a very very strong demon
[1:29:29] the demon of fear
[1:29:35] now when faith takes root
[1:29:39] it brings results
[1:29:42] and you wonder why fear when it has
[1:29:45] also taken roots produces results
[1:29:50] we saw that in the life of job when he
[1:29:53] said
[1:29:54] for the things which i greatly feared is
[1:29:57] come upon me
[1:29:59] and that which i was afraid of has come
[1:30:02] upon me
[1:30:04] that is how strong fear can be
[1:30:08] there are things that you are so much
[1:30:10] afraid of
[1:30:14] it's like you are inviting them
[1:30:19] you are inviting them
[1:30:22] you need to fight fear
[1:30:26] it is not something good to live with
[1:30:30] there is no pride in saying oh me i'm
[1:30:32] afraid i fear this no
[1:30:34] fight it if you know you have a spirit
[1:30:37] of fear
[1:30:37] fight it
[1:30:41] i had a friend he was a teacher
[1:30:45] in a um in in in
[1:30:49] in a school um at jss a junior secondary
[1:30:53] school
[1:30:53] as we used to call them in those days i
[1:30:55] don't know if they still exist in ghana
[1:30:58] now when i when i came to accra i left
[1:31:00] the northern region came to accra
[1:31:02] there was a war between the two major
[1:31:05] tribes
[1:31:06] in that part of the country
[1:31:09] and i heard that one afternoon
[1:31:13] they were in the house when a shout went
[1:31:16] forth
[1:31:17] that all the customers are coming they
[1:31:19] are in town with their weapons
[1:31:21] oh and the people just started jumping
[1:31:23] from their best
[1:31:25] jumping those who were cooking jumping
[1:31:26] from the kitchen people going through
[1:31:28] the windows
[1:31:30] and two blocks away there was a police
[1:31:33] station
[1:31:34] and they were all gathering at the
[1:31:35] police station
[1:31:37] and when they got there they were doing
[1:31:39] a head count
[1:31:41] and there was this his wife um
[1:31:44] forgot the name then the wife said i
[1:31:46] have not seen george
[1:31:47] i have not seen george and i said where
[1:31:49] is george
[1:31:50] he said george was in the house he said
[1:31:53] oh
[1:31:55] where is he i said i don't know
[1:31:58] but we were in the house together and
[1:32:00] then they said what are the men
[1:32:03] praise be to god you know in those
[1:32:07] settings
[1:32:08] when they call for the men they are
[1:32:10] calling for something else
[1:32:14] and the men some men were drawing back
[1:32:17] and then some came forward
[1:32:19] with their weapons they said let's go to
[1:32:21] the house
[1:32:22] when they got to the house george was
[1:32:25] lying on the bed
[1:32:28] i don't know how many of you have had a
[1:32:31] bad
[1:32:31] dream before where you see yourself
[1:32:34] lying down and you just want to get up
[1:32:38] and it's like something is pressing you
[1:32:40] down
[1:32:43] so george was lying on the bed with his
[1:32:45] eyes open
[1:32:46] and then he was just shaking he was
[1:32:48] there shaking
[1:32:50] he was paralyzed with fear
[1:32:54] fear would only kill you
[1:32:58] fear is nothing to entertain
[1:33:03] praise be to god fight fear
[1:33:07] like you are fighting the devil

[1:34:19] other
[1:34:22] but children of god know no fear praise
[1:34:25] be to god

[1:36:19] there is a slave shot of faith they will
[1:36:22] bring that goliath down
[1:36:26] do not look at the size of the enemy

[1:36:35] keep your focus on the promise
[1:36:40] keep your focus on the word
[1:36:47] that was how
[1:36:52] caleb and joshua

[1:37:00] size of the
[1:37:00] of the enemy they were keeping their

[1:37:53] uh retired general
[1:37:56] lloyd austin
[1:38:01] and when he was retiring

[1:38:17] them

[1:38:26] so
[1:38:29] he said something and that caught my
[1:38:31] attention
[1:38:33] he said in 2003
[1:38:37] they were in iraq
[1:38:40] and they were caught up
[1:38:44] they were pinned down by enemy fire
[1:38:49] the enemies just they were just caught
[1:38:52] up
[1:38:54] and he said at a time there was one
[1:38:57] eighteen is a 19 or 20 year old young
[1:39:00] soldier
[1:39:02] and when they started firing he jumped
[1:39:05] into the enemy's side
[1:39:08] and then after the fight and everything
[1:39:12] he called that young soldier and he
[1:39:15] asked him
[1:39:17] why is it that when we got
[1:39:21] into the enemy territory and they
[1:39:23] started firing
[1:39:24] you jump to the enemy's side
[1:39:29] and then he asked the soldier were you
[1:39:31] afraid
[1:39:33] and they also just said yes i was scared
[1:39:36] to death
[1:39:38] but when i heard the voice of the
[1:39:40] commander

[1:48:20] when he was in his camp he already fell
[1:48:24] in his
[1:48:24] fear he was already in the enemy
[1:48:27] territory the very thing he was afraid
[1:48:30] of he was giving his life over
[1:48:32] he was already in the enemy camp

[1:48:49] the lord
[1:48:50] you know but then talking about the
[1:48:51] relay i just think
[1:48:53] uh hebrew chapter 11 is a relay
[1:48:56] because paul started talking from god to
[1:48:58] adam from adam
[1:49:00] to abel and he just went in the relay
[1:49:03] throwing faith from one to
[1:49:04] another amen praise the lord i just
[1:49:07] think it was beautiful tonight
[1:49:09] but you know just like brother dan said
[1:49:12] and and we know by the word of god
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:16] that the substance faith is a substance
[1:49:20] what is the substance of fame
[1:49:24] it's a word if it is not the word
[1:49:28] is not faith
[1:49:32] the substance of faith is what god has
[1:49:34] said
[1:49:37] and the contracts here is that fear do
[1:49:40] not have
[1:49:40] no substance
[1:49:44] fear is just nothing
[1:49:47] and you see that's the reason why we are
[1:49:50] in an age
[1:49:53] that is having one of the most dangerous
[1:49:56] idol the idol of this age
[1:49:58] is nuttiness the people don't believe
[1:50:02] anything it's just it's just vague it's
[1:50:04] open it's empty
[1:50:05] there is nothing in it that's what fear
[1:50:08] is
[1:50:09] there is nothing in fear fear does not
[1:50:12] have a substance
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:16] praise the lord it don't have a
[1:50:20] substance
[1:50:22] it's just an an an an imagination a
[1:50:26] belief that have got a hold of you
[1:50:28] but there is nothing in it
[1:50:33] why the substance of faith is the word
[1:50:37] of god
[1:50:40] praise the lord the word that's why paul
[1:50:43] said in in in hebrew 11
[1:50:45] the word we have today god had made
[1:50:48] it by faith by faith this
[1:50:52] word came into existence god has to
[1:50:55] believe
[1:50:56] his own word god has to say amen
[1:50:59] to his promise when he said let there be
[1:51:01] light
[1:51:02] he said amen there's going to be light
[1:51:07] because the word of god can never fall
[1:51:10] to the ground it can never fail
[1:51:13] god is his word that just what it is

[2:01:57] in this age is god's own word amen
[2:02:02] he that declared the end from the
[2:02:04] beginning has spoken to us
[2:02:07] he that declared things even before they
[2:02:10] came to pass
[2:02:12] has spoken to us you know i was thinking
[2:02:15] the other day
[2:02:18] way back when brother branham says a
[2:02:21] woman
[2:02:22] in a purple dress
[2:02:25] you know what i was thinking in my mind
[2:02:29] how much the angels went to work
[2:02:32] to influence that lady to
[2:02:37] make her the choice of of a dress
[2:02:41] because a prophet he gave a prophet a
[2:02:43] vision
[2:02:45] 1933 and the angels went to work
[2:02:53] to bring it to pass that same god
[2:02:57] that spoke in a vision to brother
[2:03:00] branham
[2:03:01] and gave the cotter the shirt that
[2:03:04] brother biscuit would wear
[2:03:06] on that hunting trip is the same god
[2:03:09] that called out a purple dress
[2:03:12] is the same god that have promised you
[2:03:16] the holy ghost
[2:03:20] it's the same god that i've said i will
[2:03:22] never leave you
[2:03:24] i will never forsake you
[2:03:28] praise the lord now if we can see those
[2:03:31] ones coming to pass
[2:03:33] then everything that god has promised
[2:03:35] you you can hold to that
[2:03:38] if god will be so particular to give a
[2:03:41] color of a dress
[2:03:45] praise the lord
[2:03:49] brother and said he never even realized
[2:03:51] that his wife put the checkabout shirt
[2:03:53] in his clothes
[2:03:57] but because god said it god show it to a
[2:04:00] prophet
[2:04:02] there is no way
[2:04:05] there could be a mistake in that vision
[2:04:08] there had to be a boy with a checkable
[2:04:10] shirt
[2:04:13] they had to be a woman with a purple
[2:04:15] dress
[2:04:16] they have to be a bride
[2:04:20] they have to be a bride they have to be
[2:04:23] a young virgin bride
[2:04:27] that is going to take a rapture one of
[2:04:28] these days
[2:04:30] praise the lord if the angels were
[2:04:33] at work to bring that promise to pass
[2:04:38] amen i believe
[2:04:41] that the angels are our work amen to
[2:04:45] bring
[2:04:45] my promise to pass amen everything that
[2:04:49] concerns my body change
[2:04:51] praise the lord god is working on it he
[2:04:54] has
[2:04:54] everything in his control
[2:04:58] he declared things before they even
[2:05:00] happened
[2:05:02] he that declared the end from the
[2:05:04] beginning he's not into
[2:05:06] our time that's the reason why never put
[2:05:09] time
[2:05:09] never put god on your calendar don't do
[2:05:12] it
[2:05:13] because god is out of the time cycle
[2:05:16] he's out of the time cycle he's not
[2:05:20] into your 24 days i mean 24 hours a day
[2:05:26] 30 days 31 days a month god is not into
[2:05:29] that
[2:05:29] he's out of that cycle
[2:05:33] all you can do just believe take him by
[2:05:35] his word
[2:05:36] and say he that have promised will never
[2:05:39] fail
[2:05:42] the lord bless you let's go in the peace
[2:05:44] of the lord we look to see you
