forth joshua unto truth amen luke chapter 2 praise the lord we've been playing the message why it had to be shepherds that's why we've been playing a couple of weeks and [Music] uh and that's where we're taking our our christmas message from this morning uh but we what we entitled to a shepherds in the field praise the lord luke chapter 2. and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augusta that all the world should be taxed amen verse 3 and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of nazareth into judea into the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and the lineage of david to be taxed with mary his spouse wife being great with chai and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in the swelling cloth and laid him in the manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in the same country abiding in the fields keeping watch over their flocks by night and their word in the same country shippers abiding in the field keeping watch over their flags by night and lord the angel of the lord came unto them and the glory of the lord shone around about them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them fear that for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy we shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord amen let us pray together heavenly father we just want to thank you lord and we ask the father you will bless your word to our hearts of god dear lord jesus and thank you father for bringing us lord through our this year lord and we just have a couple of weeks before us will god father and then we'll be turning the page from 2020 to 2021. you've been so good to us lord your grace and your mercy has kept us father lord god in uh you have also helped us to deal with our challenges lord god and lord we we appreciate you father lord and we know you are a deliverer lord gary and you are the one lord jesus that have identified himself with us in our battles in our struggles in our health lord in our pains we pray to god that lord you will come take your word this morning father lord as we approach lord this uh the season of god lord word is greatly father lord god and uh known around the world lord gathers as christmas season dear lord god we want to bring worship to you because we know the truth oh father god that it is it's not what has been said it is but lord you have given us a revelation of god whether father this day lord or any other day we want our hearts lord like david said i want to do it in the house of the lord all the days of my life oh god i'm abide under the shadows of his wayne stating his pavilion lord that's what our heart desire so god this morning we just ask that you bless your word o father and lord god bless us also in your presence be with us now as we fellowship together around your word in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen amen praise the lord the lord bless you you may have your seed we want to talk about this this morning shepherds in the field and i thought it was it was very inspiring when when when the brothers shoes or the technicians choose to play why it had to be shippers because i had that on my mind all through uh thinking about speaking about shepherds and and it's amazing and then i said it as we play the message you're listening to it over and over one thing that is that is amazing uh there it is that just like how invisible union brother branham identified that to be his uh thanksgiving message this message what it had to be sherpa he said it was his christmas message and and it comes with that language because they are setting things that he dealt with in those messages that uh that you know that that is completely different from uh you know a traditional uh thanksgiving message or a traditional christmas message but we want to look at this uh together in the light of why it had to be shippers and i thought about this you know uh uh for a while and and just on my way to church as i was listening to to the tape being played for the sunday school brother branham says something and i just i just thought you know it just it just hit the nail it just struck you know uh uh the the inspiration there in the message why it had to be shepherds he said throughout all scriptures redemption has been represented through shepherds and sheeps praise the lord through out all scriptures redemption has been represented through shepherds and sheeps that's right we all agreed to that why it was in shadow and type that's why it had to come to the shepherds now you think about it when when uh when when when the child was born when when jesus was born the angels came down and gave the message to the shepherds now look at this now think about it the very time the style appeared in the heaven and the angels were speaking to the shepherds it was the very same time the wise men saw the style in the east praise the lord when the shepherds received the message they unite from the angels they went to meet the child why it took the wise men two years to get there the shepherds went immediately praise the lord and then over and over brother branham in that message he will echo and says but they did not believe the shepherds amen they waited two years for the wise man to come before he cut the political mind because they went to meet herod and he says where is he born king of the jews before mary got in the newspaper when the shepherds had the original message they went sinking they went running down the street christ the lord is born there's a savior born and they were not listening to the shepherds praise the lord they weren't listening to the shepherd they would not even consider them praise the lord because the work of a shepherd there was no education for you you didn't have to go to school you never had a degree to be a shepherd amen they didn't have a degree so they were not considered in in a society they were not considered who would listen to them oh my goodness why it had to be shepherds because god has represented redemption all through scripture true shepherd and sheeps merry christmas anyway oh my goodness praise the lord there is there is such a great there is such a great thing you know broad brand bring this message what it had to be shepherds so there's just just a lot of things he says there that kind of just weaken your your mind to god great plan of redemption praise the lord amen you know we've been we've been talking about genesis 1 and genesis 1 126. you know man in girls in genesis 2 and girl from a man will travel along that way a little bit here amen as as we will look at this together but what i want us to keep in our mind is the plan of redemption that has been headed between shepherds and sheeps praise the lord amen the plan of redemption that god hate you think about it god before the foundation of the word where is the foundation of the word foundation means beginning where everything begins in god's mind so from the foundation of the word god in his redemption plane produced a lamb if there was a lamb that was slain then there was a shepherd that slain the lamb are we together or am i wrong should we discuss it amen if there was a line that was slain in god's mind then he was the shepherd that slayed alive in his mind making provision for the plan of redemption praise the lord so like brother branham talks about it god the self-existent god that do all about himself and have all his attributes and ability you know and he have us as his children in his mind he taught about you before he taught about the devil amen the the the the the the the thought of the devil came to being when god was thinking about manifesting his attributes praise the lord so before he even taught about uh having anniversary to manifest his attribute he made this provision in his mind as the chief shepherd he provided alarm he taught about allam i was slain the lamb you know and make provision for my children to bring them back to me praise the lord amen so you think about it that was the first career that god ever taught about a shepherd praise the lord that was the first career that he ever thought about the first physical work he ever taught about was slain the lamb glory be to god but all of that was done because of a plan of redemption all of that was done because of a plan of redemption praise the lord automatic god will serve amen so you look at it like this god create a man in this image male and female created them that's genesis 1 26 and the bible made us to know genesis 2 7 he came to the field think about it this way the shepherd came to the field by night amen amen and there he watched over the sheep making him out of the dust of the earth praise the lord and as brother brennan would talk about this in in why how to be shepherds he taught us a great mystery of how heaven and earth embrace amen how the god of heaven identified himself with the earth that was the reason why it had to be shepherds because that was what it was from the beginning he came to the earth and make man out of the dust of the earth we know that uh we have gone through there praise the lord amen so god was revealing his purpose of creation amen and the revelation that is in there that i don't want you to miss the revelation of redemption the purpose is to self the self-existent god saving himself by manifesting his own attributes and then coming down to self his attributes to bring them to serve him the whole thing is wrapped around seven that's the reason why the thing that the new birth brings to you is a heart to self amen amen it's a heart to self that's what the new birth brings to you the purpose around this whole thing of creation is to self let it be light let it be he made the light to serve us at night and by day that's why he created all of these things is to save us can't you see it praise the lord having a sink down yet is it not real to you that the purpose of creation is to serve you are we together god revealing his purpose of creation is yourself god's serving his creation that's why he mailed the moon and the stars the sun amen the sun to take care of botany life and the moon take care of the sea life amen the moon take care of things that we don't see all of these things god made him it was not just to be there as as an attraction for beauty the purpose is to self and when he made man the purpose was to self so god rested a change of dispensation he rested in the sun that's what the holy ghost is for the work to be continued so that's the reason why adam went for serving are we together that is the purpose of redemption amen if we miss that we miss it all the purpose of redemption is to self god became man to save you to draw you to himself so you also you can self to serve others that is the purpose why because sin wrap us of that purpose and sin make us savage the sinful nature make us selfish and self-centered rule us completely from the purpose of god so god had to become man he had to come back to save us glory be to god amen so go for this christmas and look for somebody to serve that's what truth christmas is about amen because of all uh uh uh their their idolatry that is out to attitude and and which of course uh i mean that's what has said of the december 25th year we all we know about that and people make it about christmas tree they have turned to be uh you know a big thing about uh you know it's it's just it's just it's just a merchandise it just it have just become everything about a new gift and new this and you know and just new and everything new that's okay praise the lord we also want a new heart amen i want a new heart for christmas amen and a new mind for christmas praise the lord i want a new strength for christmas praise the lord but the purpose of christmas was to serve the purpose where the king was born was to self and that was a prophecy of isaiah 42 jehovah seven my seventh womb i have abhorred jehovah becoming a seven praise the lord you know since he started he have not stopped he watched over you when you are sleeping you know that [Laughter] praise the lord he keeps serving he keeps serving because that was his purpose of creation it was to self and that is the reason why he represented it in shepherd and sheeps praise the lord that is the reason why he represented it in shepherd and sheep because to be a shepherd is not how much you know directions amen no to be a shepherd is not how much you you you know about the weather what it takes to be a shepherd is the heart it's the heart that's right because gary said you are you you're going to be shepherds to these animals you you have to have a a heart to be able to bear with them to be able to feel them to be able i mean just to be there love them praise the lord oh glory be to god amen a few days ago that was i was i was looking into something not fully look into it yet but uh it's been there for a while and and it's just it just blew my mind it gave you a bit of faith you know i was looking at the scripture the bible says this gospel will be preached to all creatures humans are not the only creatures humans are not the only creatures praise the lord and the gospel is not just the scriptures this is the scriptures amen the gospel is different from the scriptures even though the four books i mean the the full testimony of the apostles have been called the gospel but it's called the gospel of jesus christ amen now so you see when god put adam there in the in the garden of eden he had the heart for all the animals that was around him not on the sheeps even the dog the goat and the lion and everything he had he had a heart for it god gave the same thing to noah for him to bring a message to a generation when the generation refused the message god gave him a heart to preach the gospel to the animals oh yeah praise the lord i think i'm kind of frustrating a little bit here let me stay with what i want to talk about hey amen amen because i mean we have we have come to to to to a generation we have come to a time where i mean there are just a lot of things that people has uh has has made an abuse of you know people has misunderstood you know in in all of that but we were getting to there when when we talked about that praise the lord amen you know i was i was i was i was looking to a message i tied to timmy the beast and i was taking it from james you know james says man has been able to tame birds and and beast praise the lord there is one beast here that need to be tamed this this guy but we will get to there when we're talking about that but let's stay with the shepherds amen let's stay with the shepherds please let's stay with the shepherds let's stay with the shepherds they were the one that received the message first the only time recorded in history were angels the first time let me say that way where angels sunk to men the first time where angels sunk to men were the shepherds praise the lord were the shepherds god came to them they were the first people the high priest he was in his bedroom sleeping snoring drooling praise the lord oh the seminary preachers they were all there they had their the argument how the messiah would come how he would come when he would come the how all of these things line up with what they knew but it pleased god to come to the shepherds in the field they were in the field children that's that's the reason why you know it was not december because the shepherds were in the field praise the lord i mean they were in the field it's not like they were they were they were they were they were camping or you know uh in their tent or whatever they were in the field are we together so we see this the purpose here because of redemption god revealing his purpose was to self you see listen to this statement we quote it all the time brother branham says if a man do missions he's always in the word of god why because when you go to do missions you go to self you don't go to law over the people you don't go to rule the people you go to sell them that's what people do many many different missions medical missions praise the lord and one of the missions that have failed is is is preaching missions because when missionaries go overseas they go to palm in the people's head they are doctrine when medical missions go on the field the goal the knee down they take care of people that are wanted to do surgery for people taking no money from them but the preachers missionary go on the field sometimes and strip the people of ever since they had that's a great statement when a man do mission he's always in the will of god why because the purpose of mission is to self is to self sorry that we have to go on missions to raise money but that's the purpose of mission that's what makes it the will of god it's always the word of god when you sell brother branham said spoken word is the original seed he said a man a man that do service for humanity he's in the will of god praise the lord the man that goes out and cured him and take blanket to the homeless people he might not know john 3 16 but that that thing that drilled his heart that gave him a compassion for another mortar a little girl that would see a wounded dog hopping on her legs and and try to feed the dog and and uh uh listening to a documentary of a little boy he just he his heart was taken by a dog that he saw as a kind of a stray dog pitiful dog coming from school so he would take his lunch and feel that dog praise the lord so one day his father decided to to find out what's going on because he realized that you know uh even sometimes when he's eating lunch he'll be eating and as soon as his father is not there he will swap the food in the bag they ask whoa you eat so fast yes yes that amen and then you go like he's playing when his dad is not looking he's slipping take the food to the dog so his dad started becoming suspicious and wanted to see what this little boy was all about he added as if to say he was going out and he hid himself and the little boy gathered some little food and you know when he went there to start dead when he saw him you know petting the dog and feeding dog eat he already gave the dog a name and daddy said bring bring the dog home that little boy grew up to have a shelter he grew up to shelter dogs praise the lord he grew out going to school in and it just became something in his heart that became part of his life you see that's the reason why when jesus talks about people that will be rewarded in the judgment it does not have much to do with your church membership it's people that have got a purpose a purpose that is attached to redemption because the purpose of redemption is to self that's the purpose of redemption is to self that is the thing that makes it difficult for the for the christian church and the christian faith with our our born again confession and receiving of the holy ghost we have little place in our heart to self we think that they have brought us to the place for people to save us praise the lord because now we think we're better than the word i would be the head the head there would be the tail that's the problem with the christian faith they have not taught our heart to self we have it all up here in cults and scripture and argument but the heart to self we have not found we have not found before you got here god provided all of these things to self you right the sun the moon the stars the rivers the trees he provided all of those things to serve you and he's at your service praise the lord talk about the two hours 30 minutes three hours we stay in church we may complain while we can serve god we give excuses here and there it's all because we have not got a heart to self that's the problem that is the problem with our christian faith the heart of self we have not found abduction message brother barum says there will be a place in heaven for a good old doctor that wakes up in the night and takes a lamp turn and go across the city the village to be able to serve his his passion he's not going to preach he's not going to lay hands and pray but he have a heart for somebody that wakes him up 3 a.m in the morning 12 o'clock in the night with some kind of a pain he find joy getting out of his sleep to walk in the forest and go himself there's a place in heaven for him there's a place in heaven that's where the disappointment will come because we will find people there that we never taught there is no record of their church affiliation there is no record of the thing they have done for god it's not what they have done for god it's what they have done for men it's what they have done for men that's what christmas is about it's not about shopping are we together this christmas message seems to be quiet but it's a good christmas message and again i say merry christmas praise the lord oh my goodness man a man is always in the word of god that's mission the heart of self is what god needs now your money now your strength now your intelligence come and tell me what the prophet said and what the prophet didn't say for us to argue call that's not what god needs what he needs is the heart to self paul in in hebrew he says provoke one another to good works encourage one another serve one another that's why the gospel is all about that's what it's all about the heart to self i mean the medical field god blessed him and god bless all of these men that are making research trying to find an answer to this covey situation men uh rubbing themselves asleep staying up hours and hours making research praise the lord and do you know brother branham says that's what we christian must be doing praying for those men you want a court you want a quote i can show it to you praise the lord if you really want to go see me after church if you're really on your heart come see me after church we'll talk about it i'll show you a call he says that's what we christian must do we praying for those men i mean that now the flood of people that have got into the medical field just because of the money no heart to self no heart they don't have a heart to self praise the lord shepherds that's why he had to come to the shepherds almost getting out of my time here let me let me hurry up amen this is familiar to us that day on calvary he was just one man a perfect man he gave his his life and he made an example for you now what must we do the first thing i want to say is jesus never live for himself praise the lord jesus never lay for himself god never god don't need a son to exist he existed before the son he don't need a moon to exist he existed before the moon and the stars he don't need him to be god but why he made him for you to save you to serve you by night and by day jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others 33 years life three and a half ministry was spain for others praise the lord that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life for yourself you have an internal life you don't have internal life for god so loved the word that he gave that he gave that he became man and gave himself the heart to let go do you know that when you forgive somebody and you let go something you are giving it's an act of giving forgive the only reason why you will not forgive because you are selfish you led to whole things to yourself so even the one that will hurt you you stay holding it internal life is living for others it proved it when he come in the lamb of god he lived and had internal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive internal life by receiving that day and you don't lay for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand and let anyone call you such a by name you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become a son and the trouble of it today is that the church has forgot who they are amen you are taking christ's place so you don't live for yourself you live for others praise the lord amen we see brother branham some will say the prophet branham that was his ministry but the people in jeffersonville knew him as bill with all the healing and the discernment that took place they knew him as bill and many never even knew him but discerning all the things he preached they knew him as a public servant during the flood they knew him as a man that was going in both and rescuing people and his own wife and daughter had to die something this this message just make us special we we we insult people we insult denomination we we disrespect people because we we get the revelation it might be a revelation that might carry you to hell if it does not affect your heart that's right revelation series bruce seven this was where people came up and taught brother branham was jesus christ just before he made a statement that i'm stepping off the field this is what he said he said i said the greatest trail i have is living for others that's what makes life real that's what make life real when you think you're just doing things for yourself and oh my goodness life is becoming real it's short it's it's it's limited because it's not out of your space and pretty soon you will drown yourself because you're just putting things on tap loading things on top there are nowhere to even pass that's what make life real is when you now what you can do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others seed this when you are really living if now you're just existing because it's just only you that's when you are really living can you touch your heart and see if it is beating mind is beating glory be to god amen and if there's happening to be someone among us who has never did that try to live for somebody else give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you when you will now live for what you can get yourself out or what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give somebody else in life and you will find that it's more blessed than riches or anything that can be thought of it's what you can do for someone else to make to make praise the lord amen to make life burden which life itself is a burden and it will make it a little lighter for someone else you just don't know the joy unless you try it once you don't know the joy until you try it once you don't know the joy until you try it once praise the lord try to go and volunteer at the shedder go to all these food distribution sites you don't know the joy until you try it once are we together to do something for somebody else he says and and then that's that bring me of thinking of 31 years of my ministry for the lord and i guess every man thinks of something when he when he has to come to his last service and come to the last hour and look back down the path and see what has been accomplished see what went on have you did anything and as i've i've just said is what you do for others that count i've often wondered what will be when i get to the end of my role which i don't know what time that would be none of us know so i was thinking about looking back down along the trail where i have come through life and seeing the different hills the barrier patches and rocks in high places smooth running and what i did in those kinds of time it will all show up one of these days at the hour of my going away cast your bread upon the water they go and wait for you on the other side when you cross the river the bridge will be there waiting for you it's the things that you you have done for others the things you have done to make traveling lighter for others praise the lord you know there is there is such a there is there are just such a contracts with the complex age and time that we are living in this age is an age that is filled with materialistic people love material things you know things are made for us to use them our vehicle our homes our cell phone they are all made for us to use them but the age gut is so much in reverse that we love those things and we use people we don't love people we're supposed to love people and use things but we love things and use people again i say merry christmas that is just a spirit in the age praise the lord i don't want to go down that route that's getting all my time here let's just let's deal with this entire redemption story here over in the message crisis the ministry of god revealed that is one of the place brother branham talking about this great mystery of god revealed that is one of the place where he uses he brings man into this into this language of partnership amen of partnership but one that will go back to our conversation you will soon see where we would go back to there christ is the mystery of god reveal oh he says now all the great revelation to restore back to kingship bring man's back he could not make them sin and remain god and then punished him for something he made them do no but when he put man on partnership with him he put me on partnership when he put you on a free moral agency for you to choose that's when men became one of us praise the lord that's why he said man has become one of us partnership oh my praise the lord then let man act as a free moral agency the same thing that he got you on today you had you had a choice to choose to be in church today or to stay home amen it's a choice that you made praise the lord glory be to god but you see this all of this is all of this redemption plan that god made man in his image an expression of him because he he was bringing man to this partnership to carry out this work of redemption that's why man has always been an agent of god god could use the son the son will preach the gospel better than a man can do praise the lord because the son does not matter how you criticize it if it is shiny it's shiny praise the lord whether you appreciate it or you criticize it is just doing this job praise the lord if you criticize me i go into office oh my oh my praise the lord he brings man on partnership paul says in romans chapter 8 verse 7 let's just read that together praise the lord you love the lord amen praise the lord romans 8 17 glory be to god verse 16 the spirit itself bear a witness with our spirit that we are children of god if we are children then here's hairs of god and join us with christ that's the partnership that he has brought us into he created a man in his image male and female created him then he sent them out two by two why because of partnership he made them male and female because of what partnership are you grabbing the concept and is god a man because of partnership is the shepherd in the sheep because of partnership glory be to god oh my thank you jesus praise the lord amen what a god we serve amen what a god we have brother branham there and why it had to be shepherds he says all through the scripture redemption has been represented through shepherds and sheeps and that's why the message always amen came to redemption by sheep because from the very beginning it was through sheep and by shepherd that he revealed himself from the very beginning slain the lamb from the foundation of the word when adam fell what he did he came as a shepherd with a lamb skin to dress them it has always been like that but to the egyptians a shepherd is an abomination so the people that have egyptian spirit rebellious spirit to rebelled against god's word a shepherd is an abomination but to the ones that have a lamb spirit you will appreciate a shepherd when you find one praise the lord i don't believe this church is named good shepherd because of his pastor if now let's let's throw all of those letters down he must be called good shepherd because god must give people hot year that are willing to self yes praise the lord if we have not achieved that we are having a blasphemous name we must take it down now he goes back he says let's let's look there at the beginning adam and eve standing there in the presence of god to hear his message they were dripped about the alarms in in sheep skin the first message ever heard was given over the top of their sheepskin that god has slayed and wrapped adam and eve in after they tried to make their own religion of fake leaves are we together now the prophets of the old testament dripped himself in sheepskin signified their faith in his word of the coming perfect lamb praise the lord i took this from what you were listening to this morning so if you were not listening i'm re-echoing in your ear praise the lord prophets were usually hers men also prophet draped himself in sheepskin because the wall the skin of the sheep they were hurting and the first message to a condemned generation was over the top of sheep's king prophet i say again warshipskin draped around themselves cause they were testifying by that that they believe that there was coming a perfect lamb for the sacrifice amen praise the lord the word of god came to them over the sheep's king these hearts men all these prophets usually abraham was a hearse man isaac he was a herdsman that's why he and love were fighting over sheeps isaac a herdsman jacob er here's my moses and let me let me let me also tell you when moses got at the back backside of the desert what the he met the poorer doing taking care of her father's sheep praise the lord amen and when there was some egyptian that were trying to to abuse them that was where moses stepped in you know that rebecca was a sheep girl yeah she was a sheep girl praise the lord i was just reading that sometime i was reading that some time ago as i was studying on this and i was i was looking into daring and it was not it was not greatly recorded but that was something that was done in the asian culture when there was not a boy in the family the girl became the sheep girl and she goes there she feeds the sheep and even there were some boys that didn't i care they were just they were just rubber they wanted to do something else praise the lord so there were girls that were shepherds not providing a place to preach the word what it types is that the bride will have the heart of a shepherd because what it represents what it comes down to is the heart it's the heart that makes the shepherd it's not the head it's the heart moses was a hurst man david where did samuel met david taking care of the father sheep doing a service while the other boys were just hanging around waiting to go in the military and uh you know hanging around doing something else praise the lord they were trying to escape from home anyway amen and you see that's a that that is that is accounted for great sense of feeling when those men come from overseas those men that are in uniform military men police officers while you are sleeping they are driving around the city glory be to god what are we talking about having the heart to self that's why paul in the book of ephesians he says you worker save your master as is unto the lord when you go to work find a heart to self people want job but they don't want to work a civilization where they want job but they don't want to work that's right oh i'm looking for the job you give them the job they complain oh this job they're just making me woman they hate me they hate me they want job but they don't want to work because it's all fun in the heart it's all found in the heart to self job said even if he's slaying yet i will serve him you see that's the reason why those men could give their life even to the lion then and to the into the flaming fire why because their heart was stolen their heart was captured their heart was given to it saith the lord love the lord with all your heart all your soul all your mind all your strength love your neighbor ask yourself are we together amen oh my goodness me notice he said as the father sent me so so sent are you the father the father that sent him went in him to confirm his word and the same jesus that sent his people goes in the people that he sent and saying the work that i do shall you do also that's when god comes behind a man is when a man has got a shepherd's heart he might not be able to pronounce his grammar right but when the heart is right god comes behind that and he back up what you are doing because your heart is right but when your heart is greed and power you want to be over this person you want to be there you want this that that's a wrong heart but man quoted in this message you listened to this morning verbum says when he says when when jesus came he says ana prophesied she prophesied blind woman she says oh how will god exalt the lowly in the sense that god has left all the celebrities he have identified himself toward the lower class of people to bring them up can you think about it two years two years the shepherds were going all over the place and now saying the savior is born nobody pay attention to them nobody pay attention to them when a wise man came in the city then you see all the news media everybody how far you people came from when you saw the stars then it's all on the news every newspaper three wise men praise the lord those wise men were astronomers reading the styles they knew there was something supernatural about those ties amen but the significant the message they never hide it if they had the message they wouldn't have gone to herald house but the shepherds had the message the angel said the savior is born that's why the angels told the shepherds the wise men only saw a star the only saw constellation of stars coming together and they follow it look at the commercial world today all their their their christmas uh mary and joseph think that they are making what they present their wise men praise the lord these wise men with their hair tired and they are sticking your hand in order where are the shepherds the shepherd has been saying this in two years two years the shepherd been saying this nobody would consider it because they were not recognized they never had degrees praise the lord amen and that is the thing that is stumbling the people in this age concerning the message that has come to our age that's the storming block because he cannot show a university he came from amen some say he used his poor birth he make an excuse here his doctrine were not right they can't say i mean that i mean they can see it but let's have a woman vice president they say so you know uh uh 1933 william branham has a have a vision he said a woman will come they will all be publicizing it but they don't have the message it's done they don't have the message it's not when they talk about the seven vision means that they believe the message they don't have the message let me read this and i find a place to close here praise the lord you love the lord while into beth to him he says how humble god make himself oh then we tried and we tried to make ourselves something great can't you see how humble how god humble himself that he might bring to pass his great promises how that little jehovah lying in the manger drop in the club taking off of the back of a yoke the neck of your way where the ox has been and wrapped in wrap the prince of peace in it mine who are we dean who do you think you are praise the lord to stand in the face of god's word and argue amen who who you think you are what do we deserve if god can humble himself like that are we to be able to humble ourselves to become his servants can we humble ourself can we start stressing ourselves with knees and know that he will take care of us our knees are so exalted in our mind that there is no place for god oh i need this i need this i need this i need this that there is no place for god if god can humble himself like that aren't we able to to humble ourself to become his seven if he if he did things like that can we forget our great degrees dignitas and things of the world and pass from that and humble ourself before him this christmas can we humble ourselves before him this christmas and just give him an hour every day two hours three hours spend time with him praise the lord if god will humble himself can't we be able to humble ourself get away from our business and say lord here's my heart take the pride take the selfishness give me something where i can be able to be a blessing to be a seven to somebody else praise the lord just like for some people they just come you know it just come automatically they are there they are serving you and some people they just come automatically they want to be safe they want to be safe they are just there they can't find anything to do it's not that there is nothing to do is because there is not a hat if there is a hat you will find it if there is a heart to do something you will find it to do you will find it what the church needs it's the heart to self praise lord when the heart is there to serve you know how to bear with people even if they are resentful to you for the first time you know how to be patient with them because all you want to do is to find that joy of serving musicians you can come give me a heart like down this grace i learned you traveling this afternoon travel
