me each one of you how many is hungry this morning how many is just waiting for god to fill you up how many's got their praise out this morning we've done our part we're ready to hear the word amen amen i just came across this quote this morning it's so good just talking about the bride of christ the church has received a heavenly sign an astronaut amen jesus christ the performer of the pillar of fire that he is in the old testament that he was when he met saul on the road there to damascus the same jesus here today amen amen and what it does it do does it bring fear no it brings love a uniting of one another amen a feeling for one another how many have a feeling for another amen a uniting of one another amen it brings the love of god oh uniting and bringing us the body of christ into unity as bride and that's what my desire is this morning that's what it's doing now this great union of god amen praise god i just want to sing a song that y'all know jesus use me lord don't refuse me my heart's called my cry of my heart [Music] jesus use me dear lord don't refuse me surely there's a work that i can aim at each one of us and even though it's humble lord help my will to

jesus [Music] lord don't refuse me surely there's a work that i can do yes oh jesus surely there's a work that i [Music] lord [Music] amen you love the lord this morning [Music] thankful for his mercy and his grace yes thankful for the songs that have been sung this morning i thank god for you know we read the scripture last night said this didn't come by the will of man the holy men of god were moved by the spirit and they spake as they were moved and yes so i didn't really expect brother stephen to be here this morning [Music] but i really wanted to hear him sing and he was moved on by the spirit to read a quote and it couldn't that quote could not go any more perfect with what the lord laid on my heart than any other quote in the message so i'm just thankful for it and uh man it's just uh it's good to be back with you again and i see some southern folks here that's are y'all back north now you're still southern right well i'm still alone i guess kind of so amen if we could this this morning let's just turn to the book of ephesians chapter 3 and just thank you for the fellowship and thank brother blattay once again for the invitation and i wanted to say i forgot to mention last night but man the church looks great i think covert was a blessing in disguise we we kind of did the same thing we remodeled our church back home and kind of went with the same color scheme as you guys and uh so it looks really good ephesians chapter 3 verse 13. it says wherefore i desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is for your glory for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named and you can be seated this morning as i said that quote brother stephen read was perfect it was talking about coming back into unity and uh so i want to take a message this morning i want to title it the family of god uh you know we we have to come to an understanding that we're all part of the same family and uh once birthed by the blood we become no more uh you know my name's farmer and brother stephen's name is carlin and we don't become farmer and carlin and brother juan but we become miss jesus christ and so i i want to look at this where it says here um family this word family of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named the word family in the greek it says it means lineage or ancestry it says it means a group of families all those who in a given people lay claim to a common origin i begin to think about this that if we were to just go around the room some of us would say well uh uh we originated from you know my family we originated from germany and you know some of you originated from uh your part in africa uh some of you would say well all i know is i'm from minnesota uh some of us would say well i'm a northerner some would say i would say i'm a southerner but what we come to find out is that none of these things matter what we what the word has come to do is to place us as sons and to let us recognize that we all have the same origin and that origin is where we were before the foundation of the world so uh i i don't know about up here but down in our area uh ancestry.com is is everybody's wanting to know where did i come from who was our grandparents where you know uh uh what nation do we come out of and so i went to ancestry.com and the slogan on the top of their page says every family has a story and so i began to think that you know uh the farmers have a story farmers are hot tempered uh heart attacks run in the family strokes run in the family so i begin to think that i really don't want to lay claim to the origin of the farmer family and and you know uh uh we've got some family members that you know i mean drugs kind of run in the family and you know uh addiction to pills and things like that and so i thought i don't want to lay claim to that but i would like to lay claim to the real family the seed of abraham the the lineage of jesus christ that's the claim that i want to leave so i want to look every family has a story so i want to look at where our story begins john chapter 1 verse 1 and it says in the beginning now we find and i just want to stop here we find genesis 1 1 says in the beginning but we understand that's a different beginning and brother branham addresses this he says you can't go any further back mentally speaking than the beginning that's mentally speaking but this morning we want to get out of our mind and let the mind that was in christ come into us we want to get out of this mental capacity and the things around us are things of the world and when we go we want to go back because john 1 1 was before there was a world but it says in the beginning was the word in the beginning before there was man's idea before there was thought of man brother stephen there was just word that was what was in the beginning but he says the word was with god so there was a being in the beginning that was so much word that when john looked at it and i believe that to be christ that he said that that the word was with god but also the word was god so you have god which is a spirit then you have christ the manifestation of the spirit of god and the word was with god and the word was god but now i want to go to verse 2 and include you and i in this chapter he says the same was in the beginning with god so now look here's john looking into the heavens and he goes wait a minute i see the word i see more word that's in the beginning with the word but then he sees a bride body and he says now i see something that is so much word that all i can say is it's the same thing when john saw the bride the bride and christ and the word were won [Music] he said all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men brother branham said in the beginning before there was a world before there was a star before there was a sun a moon or anything else that's in the beginning hebrews 11 and 14 it says for they speaking about the fathers of faith for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country how many seek in a country i like verse 15 it says and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned and the word mindful means to be aware of something of importance so the scripture is telling us that they were seeking to go to another country abraham sought for a country not made with a man's hand and so now the scripture says what abraham needed was to be mindful that he was already in that country and so i begin to look at when you if you're we need to be mindful of where we came from brother branham tells the story about the old man you remember he said he went to the meeting there and he said all these preachers were preaching about things that was going on down here on the earth right he said but one old man got up there and said he was a bald-headed couldn't hardly walk walk him with a cane right old and he said but he wasn't preaching about what was going down here on the earth he said but he went way back billions of years before there ever was a world now watch what happens when this old man old walking with a cane when he gets his eye off of what's going on on the earth and he gets his mindset on the heavens and what happened before the foundation of the world the prophet says the old man with a cane jumps up in the air clicks his heels together and says there's not enough room for me on the pulpit i begin to think that if looking before the foundation of the world would cause a 90 year old man to dance in the spirit what audit to do to us to look and see where were we [Applause] one time job was going through a battle and you know we go through trials sometimes we act like you know i preached a message on trials back home and i read the scripture it says don't think that some strange thing happened to you right sometimes we go through a struggle and we we we act like you know it just it's mind-blowing that we would have to go through a trial and the bible said don't think that it's something strange don't think that it's strange that cove had happened don't think that it's strange that you lost your job don't think that it's strange that the car breaks down don't think that it's strange that church trouble happens these things are going to happen he said let me just go back to this if they had been mindful of that country from which they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned so the entrance into that country is the mindset that you came out of it now watch this brother branham says and you can look this up quote before the foundation he says it 519 times that shook me brother stephen that brother branham over 500 times pointed our mindset to not what was going on here but something that happened before the foundation of the world now watch this he says that's the way we are here we come from a higher being in the beginning we were in the image of god the veil and the darkness keeps us from knowing it now but jesus told his disciples he was with them before the foundation of the world see we were you can't know it now but you was in the beginning and if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting hallelujah then we move into this theophany watch i says this where we once lived you're actually trying to go back to where you already lived at hallelujah now i want to go back to the story i left off god comes to job in the midst of job's trials and he did not say job do you remember when i gave you children because job's final anchor was not in children he did not say job do you remember when i gave you the oxen because job's final anchor was not in oxen but he said joe do you remember before the earth was formed when the morning stars were shouting and all the sons of god shouted for joy job where were you the only way to overcome the trial of this flesh is to understand i have another tabernacle [Applause] he said then we move into this theophany where we once lived now you want to know where spirits come from i want you to understand every spirit that you combat it has a beginning there's a history for it brother branham says we realize that satan in the beginning set up a kingdom in the northlands to be more beautiful than what michael was and there was a day that he declared war in heaven and he pulled two-thirds of the angelic beings with him now i want you to look at this here we are brother branham says we were there in the beginning he said we were made in the image of god he told job we were shouting we were worshiping we were singing let me tell you if we're going to shout and worship and sing over there i think we ought to do it here you know the way that you can show you're a son is that you remember we were supposed to be shouting right that's right but satan's goal from the beginning was to break up the family watch what he does he gets jealous and now he wants to be like god he's not satisfied with pointing worship to god now he wants worship to himself have we not seen that around the message come on have we not seen men that want worship to themselves we have we have seen men that i'm the only one that's got it right and i'm the only one you've got to come to me to get the word let me tell you that is a lucifer spirit on a man right that's right so brother madam says satan never changes his tactic neither does god it just changes ages he said but what satan got in back there to the first family of god on earth here it is brother sister don't fail to get this now brother branham says don't fail to get this i cannot really start listening he said how did satan get to the first family he could break it no other way but to get the word broke for they were fortified behind that word and i like the way brother branham says this he doesn't say that he broke the wall of the word down he said if he could only get one gap you see satan is not looking for every wall around you to be broke down satan is walking for one little entrance one little root of bitterness god just preached here for a minute there was a brother in our church one time we we had a man that he he had went out and sinned and he came back and he repented he wanted to be reunited with his family and this brother comes to him and he says brother i want you to understand something i will never forgive you and so our pastor was talking with him and he said brother why are you why are you so adamant to not forgive this brother you know it just really wasn't making sense and the lord began to show our pastor something out of his history and he said brother you're not angry with this man he said you're angry about what your father did 40 years ago and the brother admitted brother stephen he said yes he said my dad has been dead for 15 years and i'm still bitter in my heart toward him [Music] and the root of bitterness sometimes will be so i don't know why i'm here but the root of bitterness will be so engulfed in ourselves that it defines we cannot even we can't have friends hardly because of roots of bitterness we cannot lean on our brother and sister we cannot even fellowship freely with one another because of all roots that are still hanging around i say god come by this morning and root out everything if there laying there that's wrong god root it out he said he's just looking for one gap he said that's how he got every church in every age he just got that one gap he said well i believe the bible is right but i don't believe that and there he'd go too bad but there he went he said it's every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god now i'll mention this last night about eve in the garden but watch what happens the only way that satan could enter into the human race was by the breaking of a blood cell and the blood cell of satan of lucifer now enters into the human race and now we've got sin in the garden and because of sin god runs them out of the garden and there's an angel placed at the way at the entrance back to the garden of eden with a flaming sword but i'm thankful that the word also said that there would be an entrance ministered unto us into the everlasting kingdom i'm going to tell you i'm looking for the stephen for that entrance back to the garden of eden and i'm going to tell you where the entrance is it is through the ministering of the word you see we wonder now how can how could cain have killed abel because he didn't recognize it was his brother and the reason he didn't recognize him as brother is because satan was in the mix and so when you understand when you get message brothers that are fighting and cannot love one another and we can't feel for one another and we can't be brothers anymore you understand satan is god in the mix you understand when we cannot fellowship and when we cannot put our arm around the brother that we barely disagree and still love that brother now satan is in the mix the only way for satan to get in was through the breaking of a blood cell so now we have a human race that is messed up it is doctored up by the devil so there's only one way to fix that brother oil we needed another blood cell brother branham called he called a kinsman redeemer a goal g-o-e-l and he said it means one who is worthy i begin to think that there had to be another blood cell that could come and fix what the devil messed up and brother branham said it like this he said their god he said he humbled himself down and became a blood cell and he said the blood wrapped around it he said now it's billion times smaller than a natural eye could see that blood cell was he said and then the blood wrapped around it he said but god was the egg god was the germ placed into the to the womb of mary now watch this the blood cell comes from god and when the blood cell was broken at calvary the life of that blood was able to enter back into the human race the blood of god was already in the human race but it had been tampered with in the garden that is how you get serpent seed but now because of the shedding of the innocent lamb of calvary the breaking of a new blood cell is now has the power to overcome the enemy in me and you amen i want to look at this goal though one who is worthy he could not be one with sin he cannot be one with a spot so let's look at a man that's not worthy one time joshua excuse me moses he wanted to lead the children of israel over and so he comes in contact with the burning bush and the lord was wanting moses to know you're not worthy he said moses take your shoes off amen joshua one time came in the presence of the captain of the host and joshua wasn't worthy and he said you take your shoes off well in the story of ruth we're told that tobe wanted to redeem ruth but he did not have enough finances to redeem naomi so boaz comes on the scene and he says to if you don't have the money to redeem not only the gentile bride but to redeem the jewish bride then you can't redeem ruth entirely he said but i'm worthy i have the finances he said tobe take your shoe off but one day our lamb our kinsmen came walking down to the banks of the jordan river and john the baptist looked at him and he said behold the lamb of god whose shoes i'm not worthy to loosen there was no man that could say to christ you're not worthy john said leave your shoes on you're [Applause] [Music] now the breaking of this blood cell i'm going to go back to the quote you read brother stephen it reunites the family the breaking of the blood cell of lucifer divided the family the breaking of this blood cell brings the family back in unity again brother branham says it this way in the kinsmen redeemer he said god became man he had to become kin folks and he couldn't be god and us sinners creations of his creation creative beings of his creation because we couldn't be kin folks there i want to ask you to think in your mind for a moment what is god because i think sometimes we read quotes and we don't catch the power that's laying in them what is god he's all-knowing amen he's the all-in-all he's the alpha and he's the omega so brother branham says this so god the creator of heaven and earth right god became man so we understand that when you see jesus you are seeing god in a human body but brother branham says god became man that man might become god [Music] what is god come on god is a creator see brother branham says these quotes and now you start to see them line up brother branham said you're messiahs little messiahs brother branham says you have the power to speak a world and go live on it i want to tell you i don't want to live in this united states anymore i want to speak my own world and even though i've got to work in the united states i've got to live here and i've got to drive through the city but let me tell you i am every day when i get up i speak a new world and i go live on it me and god we just step over into another dimension i may drive here but i'm walking in a higher place [Applause] god became man that man might become god look at how much power you have the song says he became me that i might become him by grace now brother branham says in blind bartimaeus he said the weight of every sin that was ever committed on the earth or ever would be committed rested upon his precious shoulders he was a big man so i looked at this the other morning i my mind just began to go back and i thought about how much weight did he carry to that cross brother branham says the weight of every sin that was ever committed brother he had to run now remember brother branham would stand he was a word prophet and he would stand on the on the platform and he would look at people in this world in this hour and he would say i see you 35 years ago so a word prophet son of man ministry has the ability to stand here but leave and go somewhere else and the brother branham says that he went back 4 000 years i'm going to tell you what my lord and savior done he stepped into another dimension and he went to the garden of eden and brother he picked up mother eve's sins and he said just lay that sin on my shoulder [Applause] he began to walk down through time and he came past abraham and he said i want to take abraham's laughing i want to take his doubting and i just want you to lay it upon my shoulders hallelujah oh let me tell you how great the blood is how great is the blood this morning i want to talk to you about how great the blood is this is how strong the blood is brother this is how strong the blood is let me turn i got an alarm going off i don't know why it ain't time yet is it i want to talk to you about how strong the blood is in the book of genesis it said that when the angel spoke to abraham that he fell on his face laughing but when paul wrote about abraham he had to look through matthew mark luke and john he had to look through the blood and he said abraham never staggered abraham said how could i being old and well stricken in age but when paul looked through the blood he said abraham never considered his own body abraham said how with sarah's womb being barren can this happen but when paul looked through the blood he said and he never thought about the deadness of sarah's world that's how powerful the blood is the blood is so powerful that the eye of a prophet cannot see sin when he looks through the blood i see him come down oh i want to talk about the sin that jesus washes away he comes down to a little woman the scripture tells us that she was a harlot rahab the harlot what an ugly name to have but she received the message there were some messengers that came and she received the message and i want you to understand something everybody was destroyed around her everything about jericho was laying in ashes and in rubble but it made me think about the prophet of god said that we the bride of christ will walk out on the ashes of the wicked amen but there was a promise given to rahab if you will apply the token you and everybody else that you can fit in that house is going to be saved and the prophet of god came and illuminated that to us and he said mamas you claim your children and you apply the token over them and he said thus saith the lord they'll be there i don't understand it but i got two little girls at home and i want you to know i've claimed them so i don't understand it but i love it i don't know how it works but all i know is wherever my little girls go throughout life they've got a scarlet thread left onto them i don't know what they're going to do when they get older but there's a cord that has been hung out of my window there's a token that has been applied to my children and it is just saith the lord [Music] hallelujah i got to find this scripture the lord's just giving me this phrase i gotta i gotta find this here the book of hebrews chapter 11 rahab walks out she's a harlot but did you know that the bible said that you can't bring an accusation unless there's two or three witnesses of good report that's right and so the lord killed all of rahab's accusers so hallelujah so salmon the great high priest them walking in with the spools of jericho and he needs a wife see sometimes the devil tells you you're not fit to be the bride well just tell him to shut up and salmon said that woman's beautiful and some of those men i'm sure stand around old legalistic preachers they said ah you don't know where she's been you don't know rahab's past and so they came to salmon i'm sure i'm just going to dramatize this they said salmon we know you think rahab's beautiful but man she's got a past she's got a bad past and salmon said okay what do we do with an accusation we've got to find two or three witnesses of good report so salmon said if you can bring me two or three witnesses out of and jericho come on brother brandon said joshua means jesus and joshua or jesus said salmon there are no witnesses they're all dead glory to god he said by my own sword i killed every last witness in jericho i will tell you when the devil comes to you bringing up your past remember the devil is alive [Applause] the devil's accusation could only be proven if he had another witness and they would have to be of good report but god said the devil's a liar he is a blood and his word [Applause] [Music] let me find this scripture hallelujah i gotta find it it's beautiful amen well i can't find it here we go hebrews 11 31. he's still a liar by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace look at this she didn't perish because of what she believed believing in the shed blood of the lamb takes away you you don't have to perish the devil says you're going to die i'm not going to die [Music] i was speaking with brother frank prater yesterday on the or day before yesterday and i said you know i think sometimes we discount what god has done for us the prophet of god drew out one time on the board and he said there's that each person you are a triune being you're made up of body spirit soul so when you get a new birth there's a new soul so the soul has been changed and the soul begins to change the spirit that's right and now the devil's saying you can't make a body change i want you to understand something not only am i going to make a body change but the soul has been changed the spirit has been changed i'm already two-thirds of the way through the body change i'm not looking for something to come it is happening now the word the scripture said from glory unto glory he is changing what is changing a process he picked up and he went down a little further he got he got rahab's sin he picked up ruth's sin and he picked up job's children sin but i see jesus walking now he's still he's walking back in time and he walks out on a banister and he looks down and he's standing next to david and he sees david lust after bathsheba and the lord said if you're going to be part of my lineage i got to remove this sin so he just picks up david's adultery and he just laid it right there on his shoulders [Music] i find in another place where he picked up hosea's wife all of the whoredom he just laid it upon us precious shoulders he brought every past sin brother brahm said every sin that had ever been committed he brought every sin up to date and it was so heavy that the bible says that he stumbled under the weight of the cross and i'm going to tell you all things happen for our good and even though the roman soldier didn't know it he said you know this man needs some help carrying this cross and he picked a man out of the crowd and he said i want you to carry his cross let me tell you why his cross needed to be carried because jesus had another 2 000 years worth of sins that he hadn't got yet and about that time as simon picked up his cross jesus began to step forward amen and he saw where stephen was being stoned and he said i'd just like to take that sin of paul because he's going to be one of my church age messengers and if that sin lays on him it can't happen so he just took that sin and he just laid it right up on his back jesus went and he picked up peter's denial come on now he picked up peter's denial and he just laid it up on his precious shoulders let me just stop here some people around this message believe if you walk away from the message there's no coming back don't discount the value of my precious lord jesus blood because peter denied the message of the hour right the message of the hour was christ and peter denied it so what happened when jesus rose from the dead he already knew that all those legalistic preachers had put peter out so what did he tell mary he said go tell my disciples and peter that i'm resurrected the invitation good god almighty it does not matter how far you run it does not matter if you walk away from the message the invitation is still open [Music] i got a precious brother down in north carolina one of my dearest friends that walked away from this message and said brother branham's a false prophet but i want you to know i believe there's a way back for him and brother latte when he comes back i'm going to be the first one with open arms to greet my brother back and welcome him back into the pool he took the sins of seven church ages i want to tell you he came down where i was at see i was raised in the message but i i was a little devil child come on i had addictions i was a mess i was a sinner but god knew there was no way i could ever walk to a pulpit free unless he would walk down to an altar where i laid down one night and jesus just walked over that altar about 18 years ago and he picked up the sins that i laid on the altar and he carried them and he put them upon his shoulders but i want to tell you it gets better than that he said that the blood of he said that every sin that had ever been committed or would be committed was on his shoulders but i got a better quote than that he said when he died at calvary every sin that ever was committed or ever would be committed was forgiven [Music] it wasn't just on his shoulders it was forgiven where did sin come from from lucifer so what did jesus do with the sin every sin was on his shoulders and he went to hell brother said he kicked the door of hell open and what did he do he took 6 000 years of sins [Applause] how would you understand now brother brandon made a statement one time if you bring up someone's past sin that sin is now on you when the devil brings up your sin remind him that sin is on him [Applause] so i want you to know something every sin up to today it's covered by the blood amen but i got a better quote than that tell me about it amen he said and tonight his blood still pleads [Applause] so you say what about tomorrow let me tell you what it said in the old testament he said every morning his mercy is you new say brother cliff i feel like i have repented so many times that i've ran the mercy of god out well just rest because in the morning he refills his mercy [Applause] [Music] he said his blood pleads tonight for our sins father forgive them they know not what they do oh you say what about my children anybody got a lost loved one they're concerned about you wonder what's going to happen to them well i'm going to tell you what's going to happen to them wherever they go the blood already beat them there [Music] he said every sin that would be committed what about if i fail him tomorrow the blood beat you there [Music] what about if my children see even job had a revelation of this job said i'm going to offer a sacrifice just per adventure just in case one of my children done something wrong so jesus just sheds enough blood that he says just in case they keep doing wrong i'm just going to keep forgiving amen he went to hell and he dropped off the sins of the world he put them back on their rightful owner now when jesus gets done putting sin away what begins to happen a process and brother branham says it this way i can see him coming back up it's the resurrection he said it's coming towards daylight there's some more people up there the old testament saints they couldn't go to heaven now watch this the old testament saints had some bloodshed but it was by the blood of bulls and goats how do bulls and goats reproduce by sex act nothing that is born without being born of the spoken word can free you of sin he said they couldn't go to heaven they had to stay in paradise because the blood of bulls and goats won't take away sin it just covers sin he said but jesus has shed his blood that divorce is sin it puts her away and wipes her out he said i see him there's another place up there called paradise i can hear the door open listen to this brother branham go back and watch this in your message search i hear the door open brother branham knocks six times not seven because it wasn't the seventh dimension that he was at it was paradise so he knocked six times to a people that were held by blood of bulls and goats and somebody said who's there open the door abraham and he said sarah come here that's the man that i entertained that day under the oak tree brother stephen i'm going to keep going back to your quote the same jesus christ he said that's the one i entertain under the oak tree daniel said well what do you say that's the rock that i saw hewed out of the mountain without hands here come ezekiel and said i seen him he was in the heavens and the clouds looked like dust under his feet he said boys you have all believed under the shedding of the sacrifices of the blood of bulls and goats but sin is divorced now amen we're going up [Applause] watch this as good as they could be they were in a holding place because the blood had not been said they lived the law brother bate but living the law did not put them in a rapture see we try to preach people into a rapture by your hair's got to be this way and your dress has got to be this long and you got to do this and you got to do that but i'm going to tell you what he's showing us right here that the difference between being held in paradise and being raptured into the throne room was one drop of blood he said but when the son of god died the life that was in him was none other but god to come back and adopt us into the family of god and now we are children of god the life from his blood how precious is that blood and now he says you are the life of the blood you got to understand we would give anything to hold one drop of literal blood in our hands but the life of that blood is in the bride how many of you would like to touch a drop of the blood of jesus then reach over and touch your neighbor come on you didn't get it the life of the blood is within the body of christ you say i want to touch the body i am the body where is the body it's here among you [Applause] he said moses was in him joshua was in him and if you are in him you was in him before the foundation of the world the family of god you suffered with him you died with him you went to the cross with him you raised with him and now you're still with him sitting in heavenly places reflecting the message of the age to the world the light of the world we'll walk in the light what's the old song say the beautiful light jesus the light of the world but now the prophet of god says you are the light of the world i don't know what time i got up here so i don't know when i'm supposed to close galatians 4 it says now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all you know that scripture just that's beautiful he said he's no different than the servant even though he's the lord of all you say brother what about the alcoholic sitting on a bar stool but he's still the lord of all he just don't know it yet thank you lord and all you've got to do to be lord of all is just accept the image of the son did you ever hear the story about the painting there was a rich man he had many millions of dollars worth of paintings i think there were van goghs and there were michelangelo's there was all kinds of art and painting and there was an auction and there were all the rich people had showed up millionaires were there they wanted to come and buy this expensive art the auctioneer started off and he said he said there's this one painting that's got to be sold first according to the wheel and it was a painting and it wasn't good it wasn't pretty it wasn't it wasn't that great of a painting it didn't have any value but it was a picture of his son that had died in the war and he said this picture must be sold first no one would bid on the picture because it seemed of no value it was just a picture of the sun and there was a farm hand that had worked there with the with the old man and he walked up and he said i don't have much money all i've got to my name is ten dollars he said bye i knew that boy and i would like to buy that picture with this ten dollars the auctioneer said ten going once going twice going three times sold he said the auction is now over the millionaires they looked around they were astonished this is a true story and the auctioneer said according to the will the seller said that whoever takes the image of my son is the heir of everything at home [Applause] i want you to understand that it doesn't take money it doesn't take by speech but it takes taking the image of the sun and when you take the image of the sun you are heir to everything he said he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts see how many of you got the holy ghost now you know you got the holy ghost but does the devil still not tell you you're not going to make a rapture you can't have one without the other watch this because you're a son let's put that scripture up there where are we at galatians 4 and 6. why do you have the holy ghost because you're a son you didn't get the holy ghost because god said well i feel sorry for him i'm just going to go ahead and give him a blessing no because you're a son he sent the spirit of the son into your heart and what does it cause you to do abba [Applause] [Applause] the spirit within the future you are my father and brother brown said god cannot lose a one if you are a part of god god cannot continue eternity without you wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ one more scripture galatians 3 26 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you have received as many of you have been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek neither bond nor free neither male nor female can i go a step further there's neither black nor white there's not mexican and portuguese and come on there's not brazilian and egyptian and russian there is no more room for that in the church there's no male or female we are all one [Applause] that's why the prophet of god said he said the love of jesus christ makes the tuxedo hug the bib overall it makes the white man love the black man what does it do it puts away enmity what did the seed of the serpent do he said it will be enmity between my seed and thy seed so what does the breaking of the blood cell of christ do it ends enmity in closing let the musicians come brother brian i'm in the token he said your life has gone now i want to bring you back full circle to john chapter one your life has gone and you are dead your life is dead you are hid in god through christ and sealed in there by the holy spirit the mind that was in christ is in you now look at the difference paul when he was preaching it said let this mind be in you but in our age our messenger said this mind is in you he said and christ i want you to catch this christ and the bible how precious is christ amen how precious is he amen how precious is the word [Music] he said christ and the bible and the word is the same he takes us back to john 1 1 here he says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god now listen he says then you somebody say me me and the word and god and god and christ are the same [Music] jesus when he walked on earth was god veiled in a human flesh brother branham said one time he said every scripture has compound meaning i want you to look at this scripture a little bit different jesus was standing on earth in a flesh body death was subject to him leprosy was subject to him and he said i'm preparing a place that where i am [Music] where was he brother stephen he was in a flesh body but satan had no control over him and he said i'm preparing a place that where i am [Music] that's where you can be by the blood there's a place prepared that you can walk and cancer has no hold over you diabetes has no hold over you lust has no hold over you the things of the world have no more hold on you i want you to understand i believe when we catch this revelation [Music] brother stephen this body's got to give way [Music] i'm looking for the body change i am looking for the open door now what you understand brother stephen one of these mornings it's gonna click and every revelation that has been preached it's going to unfold and i'm going to look in the mirror and this body will have to turn loose to the revelation this body will come subject to the word paul said mortify the deeds but this flesh will be mortified by the word and this body will be changed [Music] brother and sister this is not something coming in the far blue yonder it is upon us every prophecy has been fulfilled the prophet of god said every prophecy every one of those visions have already been fulfilled he said the only thing we're waiting for is the coming of the lord he has come we've united with him in our soul our spirit is united with him all i'm waiting for is that open door and this body this old robo flesh is just going to drop [Music] see i won't tell you something i want you to understand how much i believe the rapture bro stephen brother scott didn't die [Music] the little bit i was around brother scott that man was raptured that's why paul said what you you want to talk to me about a sting you want to talk to me about a a victory in grave a sting in death he said take this body i got another one waiting on me i say to me let the government take me let them lock me up somewhere let them put me in an electric chair brother for preaching this word let this body be dissolved there's another one i've already heard from about theophany there's another body already waiting [Music] hallelujah how many is ready how many is ready for that change the final step the final step oh you took a step one night you
