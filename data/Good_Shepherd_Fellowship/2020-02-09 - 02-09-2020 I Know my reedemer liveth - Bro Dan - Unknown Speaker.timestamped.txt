[1:00:03] for having made this day possible when
[1:00:07] we woke up this morning it was snowing
[1:00:09] so heavily and already there was about
[1:00:12] three four inches in the driveway so I
[1:00:16] started wondering what I will have
[1:00:19] church at all but here we are purely by
[1:00:23] your grace we are so thankful Lord that
[1:00:28] you have gathered us again for whenever
[1:00:30] we come together we know something
[1:00:32] special is going to happen what exactly

[1:00:37] something is bound to happen we are so
[1:00:40] grateful father for as many as you have
[1:00:42] gathered this morning to lift you up for

[1:01:21] our so glad we thank you for this faith
[1:01:24] who is not feeling fine we also remember
[1:01:27] before dear brother zekiel and as many
[1:01:29] as I know feeling free in the household
[1:01:31] of God Father let your healing virtue
[1:01:33] flow through them heal them inside out
[1:01:36] and oxide in thank you Jesus and praise
[1:01:39] be to the Holy Name for the miracles
[1:01:41] that have wrought in our lives in Jesus
[1:01:45] name Amen
[1:01:47] shall we seated praise be to God
[1:01:55] I know my Redeemer liveth this was the
[1:02:01] same one the Prophet preached and I
[1:02:04] talked about this somewhere last year
[1:02:05] July in Iowa City and I just pray God
[1:02:09] that somehow God would touch every heart
[1:02:13] and would touch every soul and I would
[1:02:17] speak to you personally praise be to God
[1:02:20] I know my redeemer liveth praise be to
[1:02:26] God now I want to take the word radium
[1:02:31] to redeem is to gain or to regain
[1:02:37] possession of something in exchange for
[1:02:41] payment and some of the synonyms I got
[1:02:46] where retrieve to regain to recover to
[1:02:52] reclaim to repossess in other ways you
[1:02:56] are taking back something that once
[1:03:00] belonged to you if it wasn't yours in
[1:03:04] the first place
[1:03:05] you couldn't redeem it
[1:03:09] you are regaining possession because
[1:03:13] once it was in your possession and I
[1:03:19] always like to use this analogy about a
[1:03:23] pawn shop operator that you think about
[1:03:28] maybe you got so broke and you need
[1:03:32] money and then you look all around you
[1:03:35] there is no way to make money and all
[1:03:39] you can think of is that beautiful ring
[1:03:42] your wife put on your finger or your
[1:03:45] husband put on your on your finger that
[1:03:47] day you stood before the congregation I
[1:03:49] said I do I do
[1:03:52] praise be to God and then you look at it
[1:03:55] it's worth probably ten thousand dollars
[1:03:58] but you are so broke you just need
[1:04:01] something small to manage and then you
[1:04:04] go to this pawnshop operator and say you
[1:04:06] know what I need some money
[1:04:08] he says yes I can't give you money what
[1:04:10] do you have as a collateral oh I have my
[1:04:13] ring I can give it's okay
[1:04:15] hey loser the ring $10,000 so okay you
[1:04:18] know what I'm going to give you three
[1:04:20] thousand and then you are going to pay
[1:04:22] me back four thousand dollars to get
[1:04:25] your ring but you say yes I agree I give
[1:04:29] the ring out I make sure all that while
[1:04:33] my wife doesn't even see that finger
[1:04:36] praise be to God
[1:04:38] yes and I take this money now even
[1:04:44] though I have lost possession of the
[1:04:46] Ring the pawnshop operator who is
[1:04:49] keeping the ring has no authority over
[1:04:52] the ring to sell it he can go ahead Stan
[1:04:59] and propose the woman was to marry I
[1:05:01] don't care what he can never take the
[1:05:03] ring to put a name on another person
[1:05:07] even though the ring is not in my
[1:05:10] possession I have authority over it
[1:05:14] and whosoever has their ring in their
[1:05:18] possession does not have authority over
[1:05:20] right once I get our money I go I pay I
[1:05:24] take my ring back oh when I'm so broken
[1:05:28] I can't even get it back somebody can
[1:05:30] just go to the pawn shop operator do you
[1:05:34] know Daniel he said yes I know him very
[1:05:36] well
[1:05:37] he also money here I'm here to pay for
[1:05:40] it and now to take the ring it's a okay
[1:05:42] I agree you can pay for it but I can't
[1:05:45] give you for the ring but it's okay to
[1:05:47] pay for it you can carry the receipt to
[1:05:49] him let him come and take his ring I
[1:05:50] campaign go and her brother Daniel but
[1:05:54] you know you can vote for your ring
[1:05:55] because it's been paid for once he gets
[1:05:59] there is just nice to be nice Elsa can
[1:06:03] be so rude to him go there and take my
[1:06:06] ring and wouldn't even say goodbye
[1:06:07] why because it is mine praise be to God
[1:06:13] just keep this at the back of your mind
[1:06:16] because we are coming back to it my
[1:06:21] Redeemer liveth the Bible says that when
[1:06:26] the children of God gathered together to
[1:06:31] present themselves to God the devil also
[1:06:34] came to present himself to God it was a
[1:06:40] chiral of God like we have gathered this
[1:06:42] morning to present ourselves to God to
[1:06:46] praise God and guess what the devil is
[1:06:48] here today what I was in good we had to
[1:06:53] postpone service but I bet you he didn't
[1:06:57] wait till 11 o clock when we're coming
[1:06:59] in he was here long before we came we
[1:07:04] are here to praise God to worship God to
[1:07:08] tell God how much we love him for what
[1:07:10] he has done for us to lift him up to
[1:07:12] bless him but that is not why the devil
[1:07:15] is here the devil is here to counter
[1:07:18] what we are here to do their double is
[1:07:22] our enemy the devil is no friend
[1:07:27] if you wonder why some people come to
[1:07:30] church and when the weather buddy's been
[1:07:32] priests they get offended is because the
[1:07:34] devil is here if you wonder why people
[1:07:38] come to church and when the waiter
[1:07:40] buddy's been priest under the poor
[1:07:42] Indian notion of the Word of God and
[1:07:43] this sit down in this slip is their
[1:07:48] devil the devil doesn't want you to get
[1:07:52] blessed and in a way the devil is going
[1:07:55] to get the word over your head he will
[1:07:57] do it if the devil cannot stop you from
[1:08:01] coming to church and you have made it
[1:08:03] here
[1:08:04] his next duty is to make sure that you
[1:08:07] leave here and go home without in a
[1:08:08] blessing so if he can cause you to slip
[1:08:11] he would do it it is the reason why
[1:08:16] sometimes you can be seated in church
[1:08:18] and your mind is out of here you are
[1:08:21] thinking of the bills thinking of some
[1:08:23] partido be taking place tonight thinking
[1:08:26] of some something outside here you are
[1:08:29] bodily present but spiritually you are
[1:08:31] absent that is the devil he is not here
[1:08:37] for the same reason that we are here and
[1:08:42] guess what the devil knows the weight
[1:08:47] the devil knows the weight remember when
[1:08:52] he tempted Jesus after his forty day
[1:08:55] fast he quoted him a scripture when he
[1:08:58] told him to cast himself and he angels
[1:09:01] would be there to take charge Alesi
[1:09:02] touch his feet against the stone he was
[1:09:04] caught in a scripture from the Book of
[1:09:06] Psalms so it tells you that it takes
[1:09:11] more than knowing a scripture to do the
[1:09:14] will of God because they double knows it
[1:09:18] it takes more than here in the word to
[1:09:22] do the will of God blessed is he that he
[1:09:26] assemblance I see that with it that is
[1:09:29] blessing in here in it but the more
[1:09:32] blessing lies in doing it
[1:09:34] praise be to God their double here's the
[1:09:38] word they know the scripture yet he
[1:09:42] can't Levite it they dare the devil
[1:09:45] begins to live by the way he has become
[1:09:47] our brother he's no longer our enemy
[1:09:49] that is why you have to do an
[1:09:54] introspection examine your life it is
[1:09:59] not okay to come and hear the word of
[1:10:01] God and not do it and not defy it hear
[1:10:09] the word give yourself to the word live
[1:10:13] by it
[1:10:13] let it become your absolute praise be to
[1:10:17] God for a man shall not live by bread
[1:10:19] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:10:22] out of the mouth of God it's just this
[1:10:25] body that is feeding on them on the food
[1:10:27] we eat your real sub which is your soul
[1:10:30] feeds are nothing by the word and think
[1:10:33] about it how many times we have stabbed
[1:10:35] God we have start our souls stop our
[1:10:39] souls to death and Acura but I come to
[1:10:47] present a surfboard and the devil was
[1:10:49] there for a contrary objective don't
[1:10:58] take this for granted and God asked him
[1:11:05] what I do in here is Geron of gotta have
[1:11:09] come what are you doing here I said I've
[1:11:12] been worried to and fro up and down
[1:11:15] helter skelter all around the body the
[1:11:18] devil is a busybody and God asked him
[1:11:26] have you considered that of all the men
[1:11:31] on earth there is none like Joe
[1:11:37] sometimes we think it's us children of
[1:11:40] God who brag about God who both about
[1:11:43] God but God also boast about us
[1:11:48] bird is delighted when he sees you a son
[1:11:52] or a daughter you'll take the word of
[1:11:54] God and you live by it
[1:11:55] God is on it in that and God boosted
[1:12:02] it's like a father when he sees his son
[1:12:05] growing up and he can see himself in his
[1:12:09] son obedient child respectful child
[1:12:13] hard-working 7 God
[1:12:15] the Pharisees is always on it in that
[1:12:18] child he is delighted when he was
[1:12:22] talking about his child you will see all
[1:12:24] the light bulbs come out but it is
[1:12:28] always different when that child is
[1:12:31] disobedient it's always different when
[1:12:33] that child is disrespectful it's always
[1:12:36] I mean when that child is something else
[1:12:41] sometimes the parents
[1:12:43] I even ashamed to talk of that child do
[1:12:48] not let God be ashamed to talk about you
[1:12:53] let God be proud to say this is my son
[1:13:00] this is my daughter bird busted about
[1:13:04] job one job didn't know anything about
[1:13:08] it and what did the devil say it's
[1:13:11] because you have blessed him so much you
[1:13:15] have blessed him you have blessed his
[1:13:17] household you have blessed family and
[1:13:19] not only that you have crossed a hedge
[1:13:22] around you you have cast a hedge around
[1:13:25] his family
[1:13:26] you have cast their hedge around his
[1:13:28] position everything he has
[1:13:30] you have cos hey since we are protected
[1:13:38] we are protected there is a world of
[1:13:42] fire that is burning our ona's by day
[1:13:45] and by night our lesser safe and secure
[1:13:49] in Christ Jesus the Bible says our less
[1:13:52] time hidden him in the Father there is
[1:13:55] no way the devil can get to us praise be
[1:13:59] to God the Bible says the name of the
[1:14:02] Lord is a mighty tower the righteous run
[1:14:04] it into it and is served thereby when
[1:14:07] you are living in the weight be rest
[1:14:10] assured that there is no way the devil
[1:14:13] can tamper with your life you know what
[1:14:16] there is fire in the word look I
[1:14:21] remember back home the dogs in America
[1:14:24] here are privileged dogs back home the
[1:14:28] dogs don't have it away when the weather
[1:14:30] is so cold you know where they sleep
[1:14:33] outside then we have something to call
[1:14:36] Hef I don't know it's just sometimes
[1:14:39] stone three stones one two three and
[1:14:42] then they put the fuel wood inside and
[1:14:44] then they use that to cook in the night
[1:14:46] their dog comes and then it's feeling so
[1:14:51] cold it's looking for a warm place to
[1:14:53] sleep it will just come close if it
[1:14:57] feels the heat it goes back when it
[1:15:00] comes so close it doesn't feel the heat
[1:15:02] it to use the hand and then scratch it a
[1:15:04] little it's only the stupid dog that
[1:15:06] would jump inside praise be to God and
[1:15:10] you'll know it you will hear shouted and
[1:15:12] claimed it did something stupid
[1:15:16] better Wise Ones do just do a make sure
[1:15:18] that there is no fire and then go inside
[1:15:20] and lie down so long as you are living
[1:15:25] in the world you are insulated by the
[1:15:28] way the Word of God is fire is light the
[1:15:34] devil can't get the word out of you the
[1:15:36] only way the devil can get you is to get
[1:15:39] you to disbelieve the word and you'll
[1:15:42] live the word then the devil can get
[1:15:44] ahold of you best so long as you keep
[1:15:47] believing
[1:15:49] so long as you keep holding on you are
[1:15:52] on the winning side praise be to God yes
[1:15:57] you have cast a hedge around him he
[1:16:01] except I can't get to him why don't you
[1:16:07] just put forth your hand and everything
[1:16:10] job has just take it away from him
[1:16:13] destroy it and see if he would not kiss
[1:16:16] you and go toward the devil that go
[1:16:23] everything he has is in your hands I
[1:16:26] mean you should be happy to know you
[1:16:29] should be glad to know that before your
[1:16:32] adversary that that even comes to you he
[1:16:34] has to go to your father as for
[1:16:35] permission and God knows what you can
[1:16:41] handle he knows what you are capable of
[1:16:45] he would make sure that you are not
[1:16:48] tempted beyond what you can bear the
[1:16:50] book of Corinthians says that and I see
[1:16:54] the devil go for a mullet a mullet it's
[1:16:57] a very big hammer very heavy you can
[1:16:59] lift it with one hand and I see the
[1:17:01] devil go with it go for it with a place
[1:17:04] I'm going to ask him what are you going
[1:17:06] with that him hey I'm going to finish me
[1:17:08] said no way you are not going with that
[1:17:10] go and take that whip and I see the
[1:17:14] devil complaining and sometimes
[1:17:18] situations happen and then we'll
[1:17:21] complain how God doesn't love us how God
[1:17:24] doesn't know us how we are so down and
[1:17:27] how nobody cares if gosh you open your
[1:17:31] eyes to see what the devil was coming to
[1:17:33] do and God stopped him even in the
[1:17:36] situation you are going to glorify God
[1:17:39] praise be to God the Bible has made it
[1:17:43] clear to us that he has the evil
[1:17:45] intention against us his thought for us
[1:17:48] at of peace willing above all things
[1:17:52] that we prosper even as our souls
[1:17:54] prosper and then the devil boss o in one
[1:18:00] day
[1:18:02] I can't just think of any human being on
[1:18:04] this earth that went through what job
[1:18:07] went through it was meant to be another
[1:18:12] day job was sitting down his severs had
[1:18:17] gone out all the animals the shape the
[1:18:21] Oz in the camels for review
[1:18:22] grazing the oxygens plowing just
[1:18:26] probably sitting down and just taking it
[1:18:28] easy and then his elder son was having a
[1:18:33] party and all the current way they're
[1:18:36] enjoying themselves and Joe was sitting
[1:18:39] down
[1:18:40] remember job was a man that loved God
[1:18:43] and men that hated sin he loved what God
[1:18:50] loved he hated what God hated and God
[1:18:54] was so honored in that man and he would
[1:18:58] even perform sacrifices because who says
[1:19:02] it maybe this room would when sinned
[1:19:04] against God and he will just go ahead
[1:19:06] and perform a sacrifice a bread offering
[1:19:09] on their behalf according to their
[1:19:11] number if anything happened so God would
[1:19:15] be merciful on them this was a righteous
[1:19:18] man and when Joe was sitting down one
[1:19:22] day here as one of his service oh we
[1:19:26] were in the fed plowing the Serbia's
[1:19:30] came and they killed every one of the
[1:19:32] servants and you have taken all the
[1:19:33] animals I'm the only one that has
[1:19:35] survived to come and tell the story as
[1:19:38] soon as he was finishing here comes a
[1:19:40] relevant Oh fire fell from heaven and
[1:19:43] has consumed order our orders sheep in
[1:19:46] the field before you go through here

[1:19:51] and they have taken all the animals they
[1:19:53] have killed or the service I alone
[1:19:55] married to come and tell you and
[1:19:57] probably at this point he was thinking
[1:20:00] Oh anyway I have my children before he
[1:20:03] could even finish that here comes
[1:20:05] another servant Oh master all your
[1:20:10] children are dead not just one not just
[1:20:14] two
[1:20:15] all your children they were just having
[1:20:17] party in the elder brother's house a
[1:20:19] very strong wind came and just hit the
[1:20:21] four corners of the house who loved it
[1:20:23] an auditor and a dead Wow who is able to
[1:20:28] take this who is able to take this the
[1:20:34] Bible says he stood up here rent his

[1:20:41] his face and he did not kiss God he
[1:20:46] worshipped God He blessed God you know
[1:20:49] why brethren do not let your love for

[1:21:02] life and because of that you are loving
[1:21:04] God the day those things are taken away
[1:21:07] your love for God will go away

[1:21:14] the right thing to do love but because
[1:21:16] you love God it doesn't matter what

[1:21:22] the point of death you will not turn
[1:21:24] your back on God all that was taken away

[1:21:39] name of the Lord he did in case God

[1:25:46] what a terrible condition to find
[1:25:49] yourself you know what sometimes we find
[1:25:54] ourselves in conditions in storms that
[1:25:57] we have created ourselves because of our
[1:26:01] misbehavior because of our stupidity
[1:26:04] because of our foolishness because of
[1:26:07] certain wrong choices we have made in
[1:26:09] life we find ourselves in steady
[1:26:11] situation and you are suffering it and

[1:27:06] on God stay put you know is it washes
[1:27:11] like this when you read further the
[1:27:14] Bible says his friends head of how job
[1:27:18] was suffering and said let us go and
[1:27:20] encourage him and when they saw him afar
[1:27:23] off they could they did not make him up
[1:27:25] and when the god day they stood they
[1:27:28] just heard they were looking at job
[1:27:29] ladies the Bible says seven days seven
[1:27:33] nights
[1:27:34] nobody split nobody open his mouth they
[1:27:39] couldn't just imagine it that a human
[1:27:41] being was going through whatever going
[1:27:43] wrong it's not easy in situations like
[1:27:49] this it's very very very important the
[1:27:55] people that are around you if they are
[1:28:03] badly if you surround yourself with
[1:28:06] godly people they give you girly advice

[1:28:14] and I pray with you out of that
[1:28:17] condition oh praise be to God

[1:30:05] home we are just passing through keep
[1:30:08] reminding yourself every day you wake up
[1:30:11] that this is not your home we have a
[1:30:14] better place to go to God wants the best
[1:30:18] for his children
[1:30:20] sometimes when we say God wants it the
[1:30:23] best for his children
[1:30:24] you're tinker's maybe living in a very
[1:30:26] good house in a mansion having in the
[1:30:28] best car having the best job good money
[1:30:30] no it is not that way God is interested
[1:30:33] in your soul that is how he's interested
[1:30:36] in even though he blesses us with a lot
[1:30:40] of physical things here and there but
[1:30:42] the main point is the salvation of your
[1:30:47] soul praise be to God and a second time
[1:30:53] in the condition that our Joe found
[1:30:57] himself in it was really terrible
[1:31:00] what was the devil trying to do the
[1:31:04] devil was trying to get Joe to kiss God
[1:31:07] and in spite of all these dopes did not
[1:31:13] kiss God he did not kiss God so much so
[1:31:19] that the devil dog got into jobs wife
[1:31:21] and his wife came to him and said where
[1:31:25] do you don't you kiss your bird and I
[1:31:26] curse him and die and even in that
[1:31:30] condition when he was down and out when
[1:31:34] he was so sleepless when he was
[1:31:37] suffering we just running down his
[1:31:39] cheeks he was thrown apart
[1:31:41] broke him he still looked in the face in
[1:31:45] into the face of his wife and told her
[1:31:47] don't speak like one of those foolish
[1:31:49] woman must we only accept good from God
[1:31:52] and not accept evil should we only
[1:31:57] accept good the goodness from God and
[1:32:00] not accept evil and guess what you may
[1:32:06] have thought that it was it was jobs
[1:32:08] wife that was speaking no it was the
[1:32:10] devil
[1:32:13] when the devil came before God he said
[1:32:17] do it and see if he will not kiss you
[1:32:20] because he couldn't get his wife to kiss
[1:32:24] I mean he couldn't get a job because God
[1:32:26] now he comes to his wife and then he was
[1:32:30] his wife comes why don't you kiss him
[1:32:33] there very well
[1:32:34] the devil used before God the devil is
[1:32:41] not a respecter of persons don't give
[1:32:45] yourself to the devil if you give
[1:32:47] yourself to the devil he will use you he
[1:32:50] will you see and abandon you if you give
[1:32:54] him a yacht he would take a man you open
[1:32:59] the door for him to come in he will take
[1:33:01] over the steering wheel resist him and
[1:33:04] he will flee praise be to God and the
[1:33:14] three friends when they finally broke
[1:33:17] their silence
[1:33:18] they told joke they started to accuse
[1:33:22] him started accusing him of some secret
[1:33:26] shame oh you know in moments like this
[1:33:31] in moments like this what brothers and
[1:33:35] sisters need is an encouragement as to
[1:33:40] let them know that you are standing with
[1:33:42] them now you are we done in the midst of
[1:33:44] the storm the last time brother where
[1:33:50] the chironex came here he says something
[1:33:52] that caught my attention
[1:33:54] he said when a storm comes as Tom who
[1:33:58] just come take one house right here and
[1:34:03] there is a house behind it it will leave
[1:34:06] the house right behind it and then just
[1:34:09] come and take a little house here and
[1:34:11] you wonder what is going on you know
[1:34:19] when the storms come the stores take
[1:34:25] away some houses they leave so
[1:34:32] and it's a good thing that some of the
[1:34:35] houses are left if you have seen some of
[1:34:42] those documentaries are those I mean as
[1:34:45] stop situations the first responders are
[1:34:51] always those on the ground whose houses
[1:34:55] were not touched before the paramedics
[1:34:59] come on the scene they are already out
[1:35:01] there with your flashlight when a year
[1:35:03] help help help
[1:35:05] they are they have they are they and
[1:35:08] when they go they are not holding the
[1:35:10] person and I kissed in the past yes you
[1:35:12] were a bad neighbor God don't punish you
[1:35:15] they are dead just try to encourage them
[1:35:20] stranding them or you'll be fine we have
[1:35:23] called ambulance is on the way you'll be
[1:35:24] fine praying with them encouraging them
[1:35:28] till there is health
[1:35:31] they don't go telling them oh you were
[1:35:34] very very bad neighbor so God is
[1:35:38] punishing you that's a good thing they
[1:35:42] don't do that so it's a good thing when
[1:35:47] you look at our setting when the storms
[1:35:49] even come in our setting the storms
[1:35:52] don't come to everybody the storm comes
[1:35:56] it makes a landfall here and there but
[1:36:00] then you realize that majority of us in
[1:36:03] the house don't have to deal with the
[1:36:09] storm directly so we are there as a
[1:36:13] resource for those that are affected by
[1:36:16] the storms it is not a time to sit down
[1:36:19] and they'll cross your feet and then
[1:36:22] just lie down and then enjoy life know
[1:36:24] when your brother or your sister is
[1:36:26] going through a storm invariably you are
[1:36:30] the one going through the stone there is
[1:36:32] a time to bear them up in prayer by
[1:36:35] their and by nights that we see the hand
[1:36:38] of God in their lives and we have seen
[1:36:40] that in this church time and again we
[1:36:43] have seen it
[1:36:47] that a devil that just doesn't come in
[1:36:50] and then touch one of us and then we sit
[1:36:52] back and look no we fight the devil
[1:36:55] we'll fight the devil we have seen that
[1:36:59] and we have seen the hand of God in this
[1:37:00] house praise be to God
[1:37:05] I know my redeemer liveth it was a very
[1:37:12] terrible condition Jobe was not going
[1:37:15] through what was going because he
[1:37:16] committed anything his love for God
[1:37:20] genuine love for God and God loved for
[1:37:25] him brought him this way
[1:37:29] now before job ever got here job was
[1:37:35] always asking himself a question I see
[1:37:39] that when you cut down the tree when it
[1:37:42] bees with smell water you will see the
[1:37:46] tree button on his side there is fresh
[1:37:49] life coming I see the grass they die and
[1:37:54] then as soon as the rain comes
[1:37:56] I see the grass growing back but a human
[1:38:03] being I see a man die I don't see
[1:38:09] anything about this man again what
[1:38:12] happens when a man leaves this earth it
[1:38:15] was a question that job kept asking
[1:38:19] himself and he wanted to know he was
[1:38:23] passionate about it what happens to a
[1:38:27] man when he dies does he get to live
[1:38:33] again does he ever get to live again and
[1:38:39] job was going to find the answer and he
[1:38:44] was so great together
[1:38:46] Elsa well life was good praise be to God
[1:38:50] when he had life going for him when his
[1:38:54] children way around him Oh daddy daddy
[1:38:56] daddy touching him on the
[1:38:58] here patting him lying on his lap that
[1:39:00] was such a time he was going to get the
[1:39:02] answer but at a point when he thought it
[1:39:08] was better he had not lived when he was
[1:39:14] down and out when he was in his lowest
[1:39:18] low I the darkest moment of his life
[1:39:27] when the ground under him are tapped in
[1:39:30] oh that was a time he was going to get
[1:39:37] that ass
[1:39:40] praise be to God and I want to read
[1:39:45] something from the prophet
[1:40:06] you know what he did talking about what
[1:40:13] God did he just raised up the kitchen a
[1:40:18] little bit and said job look yonder and
[1:40:23] what did you see what do you think he
[1:40:28] saw he saw Easter for his first time he
[1:40:35] saw the first Easter and he screamed I
[1:40:38] know my redeemer liveth sometimes when
[1:40:42] we talk about Easter
[1:40:43] some people think Easter is just a day
[1:40:45] in a calendar year that when that time
[1:40:48] comes you just go in your closet and you
[1:40:51] dig out your best clothes and then you
[1:40:53] come and you worship God that day you
[1:40:55] look for your Bible you probably have
[1:40:57] nothing for a year you come and yourself
[1:41:00] God that day um then after that day is
[1:41:02] over you go you throw your Bible
[1:41:06] somewhere
[1:41:06] you threw your coat somewhere and you
[1:41:09] are ready to go back into sin for
[1:41:10] another year and then you do all the
[1:41:13] dirty things and then you wait to this
[1:41:15] another year
[1:41:16] it's another Easter and then the world
[1:41:18] is celebrating the death of Christ and
[1:41:21] then you come again for us Easter is
[1:41:24] every day
[1:41:27] we commemorate the death of Christ every
[1:41:30] day we live because that is where our
[1:41:33] hope is without him coming to die for us
[1:41:37] just imagine what life would have been
[1:41:42] every day we get to live every day we
[1:41:45] live to see we are commemorating his
[1:41:47] death praise be to God for us Easter is
[1:41:53] every day and Joe for the first time for
[1:41:58] the first time in his life he is not
[1:42:01] getting to know what happens to a man
[1:42:02] when he dies
[1:42:04] oh what a blizzard place to be every man
[1:42:10] does chosen of God and every woman and
[1:42:13] child comes to that spot on those sacred
[1:42:18] suns to where God lists the kitchen and
[1:42:22] you see him in his resurrected power
[1:42:26] praise be to God you know that he lives
[1:42:30] and we as job can cry I know my redeemer
[1:42:36] liveth and idolize this he shall stand
[1:42:41] on the eighth though the skin worms
[1:42:43] destroy this body yet in my flesh I
[1:42:46] shall see God yet in my body I shall see
[1:42:52] God that first view of Easter made a
[1:42:57] prophet scream he forgot of what he was
[1:43:02] going through he forgot a pain he forgot
[1:43:06] a loss he for but I mean oh it just took
[1:43:11] it just took took him took him from the
[1:43:15] lowest load to the highest high and God
[1:43:21] opened his eyes to see something he's
[1:43:27] been longing all his life to see
[1:43:34] and a tennis road and the legend is
[1:43:37] flush his sir Easter his first time when
[1:43:41] he did see it not when he had his
[1:43:45] well-groomed clothes on not when he had
[1:43:49] his hair combed
[1:43:50] perhaps today to their dads not when he
[1:43:53] was enjoying the very best of health but
[1:43:57] when he was in trouble when he was
[1:44:00] laying in trouble at the hour and almost
[1:44:04] of his death
[1:44:06] thus when he saw Easter thus where he
[1:44:11] saw the first resurrection
[1:44:13] oh it's been similar to you and I it's
[1:44:18] been when we laid at the altar some way
[1:44:22] until we were ready to die and said Lord
[1:44:26] God do something for me
[1:44:30] praise be to God it was then that God
[1:44:34] raised the curtain and with sin Easter
[1:44:38] with sin Easter not in a way of theology
[1:44:42] so much we never seen Easter as wearing
[1:44:46] new clothes we never seen it as little
[1:44:49] rabbits and colored eggs we seen Easter
[1:44:52] in the power of the resurrection of the
[1:44:55] Lord Jesus Christ praise be to God that
[1:44:58] was the real Easter and when he screamed
[1:45:01] God and the back praise be to God
[1:45:06] oh what a wonderful time to be a
[1:45:11] Christian you should just rejoice that
[1:45:17] you are a Christian whether you have the
[1:45:24] essential things of life or not rejoice

[1:47:10] going to change praise be to God and a
[1:47:14] ransom has been paid on that day on the
[1:47:18] cross of Calvary when his blood was shed
[1:47:21] for us and when he cried out with a loud
[1:47:23] voice and he said it is finished it was
[1:47:26] indeed finish praise be to God
