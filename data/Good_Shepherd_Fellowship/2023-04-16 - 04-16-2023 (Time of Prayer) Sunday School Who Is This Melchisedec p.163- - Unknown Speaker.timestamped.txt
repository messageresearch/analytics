[0:54] nothing
[0:58] and as sincerely in My Heart Lord I know
[1:01] that something's fixing to take place
[1:04] I cannot strictly identify it I'm afraid
[1:07] to say anything Lauren thou Norse the
[1:10] heart of your servants
[1:13] and how many times down to the age when
[1:16] you set things people fail to get a
[1:19] man is constantly praising God for what
[1:21] he did
[1:23] and seeing what great things he's going
[1:25] to do but ignoring what he's doing
[1:28] so has it been through the age
[1:30] why did the Roman Church fail to see
[1:32] Saint Patrick
[1:34] as God's Prophet why did they kill Joan
[1:37] of Arc
[1:38] when she was a a prophetess
[1:41] burn her as a witch
[1:44] father it's always past you hide it from
[1:47] the eyes of the wise and prove it no
[1:49] wonder you said to them priest you
[1:51] garnished the tombs of their prophets
[1:53] and you're the one who put them in there
[1:55] after they're gone they see their
[1:57] mistake
[1:58] they always persecute you Lord in
[2:00] whatever form you come in
[2:02] I pray tonight God just one more time
[2:06] tomorrow we're scheduled to be to go to
[2:09] Tucson
[2:10] other parts of the world other cities we
[2:13] must preach in but dear God there might
[2:15] be strangers here tonight that never has
[2:18] they've heard words preached but never
[2:19] seen it made manifest
[2:22] as I asked you at the beginning
[2:25] when those disciples
[2:27] the opius and his friend coming from
[2:30] Emmaus
[2:31] was walking along the road and you
[2:34] stepped out of the Bush and began to
[2:36] talk to him as the resurrection preach
[2:38] to them
[2:39] well I said fool slow of heart don't you
[2:41] know that Christ should suffer these
[2:42] things then enter into his glory but
[2:44] still they never recognized it all day
[2:47] long they walked with you and still
[2:48] didn't know you but one night night come
[2:51] they constrained you to come in when
[2:54] they went into the little Inn and closed
[2:55] the doors then you did something just
[2:58] the way you did it before your
[3:00] crucifixion and they recognized that it
[3:02] was the Risen Christ in a few moments is
[3:05] behind the curtains and gone quickly
[3:07] they run and told the disciples the Lord
[3:10] is risen indeed
[3:11] father God
[3:13] I believe that you're still alive
[3:16] I know you are and you've proved it to
[3:19] us so many times could you just do it
[3:21] once more for us Lord
[3:23] if we found Grace in your sight let it
[3:25] happen once more
[3:27] I am your servant these are your
[3:29] servants in your lord all that I've said
[3:32] wouldn't Mount to just one word from you
[3:36] would be more and I've said in these
[3:37] five nights
[3:39] or five messages it would be more just
[3:42] one word from you won't you speak Lord
[3:44] that the people might know that I've
[3:46] told him the truth
[3:48] granted God I asked it in Jesus name
[3:51] this once more
[3:53] amen
[3:55] now
[3:59] I don't know you I know some people
[4:02] I know this boy's sitting here
[4:05] an old bill Dallas sitting right there
[4:08] I wanna here's brother Blair
[4:10] Rodney Cox
[4:13] it's hard to see out there on this side
[4:17] right to present time I can't see nobody
[4:20] actually that I know
[4:22] now how many in here that knows that I
[4:25] am a stranger to you raise up your hands
[4:27] knows that I know nothing about you
[4:28] raise up your hands on both sides
[4:31] how many in here that has something
[4:33] wrong or something that you know that I
[4:36] know nothing about
[4:37] would you raise up your hands
[4:41] now it would be totally absolutely
[4:45] totally impossible for me to know
[4:47] anything about you otherwise then have
[4:49] to come from some revelation of spirit
[4:51] and it being I've told you all these
[4:53] nights and tonight that he is not dead
[4:57] he's here and promised to do the same
[4:59] thing and promise that there would come
[5:01] a time in the last days according to
[5:03] Malachi 4. and according to Saint Luke
[5:06] that he would appear again in human form
[5:09] among his people and do the same things
[5:12] and reveal the same thing the same
[5:14] Messiah sign how many knows that you
[5:16] Bible readers knows that's the truth Say
[5:18] Amen
[5:20] let's all be Bible readers
[5:22] now I know it's foreign to the people
[5:25] today but still it's the truth that's
[5:28] the reason they didn't know Jesus of
[5:29] Nazareth they know their Church Creeds
[5:31] but they didn't know him but he come
[5:33] just the way the Bible said not a
[5:35] theologian not a priest
[5:39] he come as a prophet
[5:42] and his own received him not
[5:45] if God will keep his word
[5:48] if I happen to it happens to follow
[5:50] someone that I know then I'll get
[5:53] someone else
[5:54] see I want somebody and I don't know
[5:58] and I want you to pray now look there's
[6:01] a little woman one time had an infirmity
[6:04] she's spent her money for the doctors
[6:06] they could do her no good and she said
[6:09] within her heart if I can touch that
[6:13] man's garments I'll be made well you
[6:15] remember the story
[6:17] and so all of them tried to get her to
[6:19] stay back but she pressed through until
[6:21] she touched His Garment went back and
[6:23] sat down
[6:26] now listen close
[6:27] and then when he did that
[6:29] when she did that
[6:32] Jesus turned around and said who touched
[6:34] me why Peter the Apostle rebuked him
[6:38] he might have said something Lord don't
[6:41] say a thing like that the people believe
[6:43] there's something wrong with you because
[6:44] when you ask them to eat your flesh and
[6:46] drink your blood
[6:47] they already think there's something
[6:49] wrong and you say who touched me well
[6:51] the whole crowds are touching you he
[6:53] said yes but I perceive that virtue went
[6:57] out of me
[6:58] that was a different kind of touch and
[7:00] anybody knows that virtue is strength
[7:03] I got weak
[7:05] virtue left me
[7:07] and he looked around on the audience
[7:11] until he found the little woman
[7:13] and told her about her blood issue and
[7:17] she felt in her body that that body who
[7:19] she had stopped is that right and he
[7:22] said thy faith has saved thee now the
[7:25] Greek word there is Sozo which
[7:27] absolutely means say physically or
[7:29] spiritual yes to say you say he is he's
[7:31] your savior
[7:32] now
[7:34] if that was him yesterday and the way he
[7:37] acted to prove that he was among the
[7:39] people the Messiah promised
[7:41] and that's where he identified himself
[7:43] in promise for the Bible he'd do the
[7:45] same thing now wouldn't he wouldn't he
[7:48] have to do the same thing
[7:49] you say did he say it not Healing The
[7:53] Sick
[7:54] yeah
[7:55] the Hebrews
[7:58] the Bible had just read from said that
[8:01] Jesus Christ now is our high priest
[8:04] that can be touched by the feeling of
[8:06] our infirmities how many knows that's
[8:08] true
[8:09] the Bible said that he's a high priest
[8:11] now that can be touched by the feeling
[8:13] of our infirmities then if he's the same
[8:15] high priest that he was then how would
[8:18] he act now it had to act the same way
[8:21] you did then
[8:23] if he's the same high priest
[8:25] now you might I'm not your high priest
[8:28] you might touch me and just be like
[8:30] touching your husband or your brother or
[8:32] what more a man but you let your faith
[8:35] touch him
[8:36] Watch What Happens amen
[8:39] now if I be God's servant
[8:42] and I've told you the truth
[8:45] God will vindicate that to be the truth
[8:48] and that would prove that Jesus Christ
[8:51] is the living tonight standing here
[8:57] is that right
[8:59] now you have faith this one-sided time
[9:03] one side
[9:05] you have faith out there I better stay
[9:07] at the microphone here because he can't
[9:09] hear me
[9:10] somebody
[9:13] just look up to God and say God
[9:16] that man don't know me he knows nothing
[9:19] about me I'm a perfect stranger to him
[9:24] but let my faith touch you Lord
[9:28] and you know what's the matter with me
[9:30] Lord you know all about me you know who
[9:33] I am the same as you know who Peter was
[9:38] same as you know Nathaniel
[9:40] as you know what was wrong with the
[9:42] woman with the blood issue
[9:44] and this man tells me
[9:47] that you're the same yesterday and
[9:48] forever then Lord let my faith touch you
[9:52] and if he'll do that
[9:54] and then fallibly prove himself here how
[9:57] many of you will believe him with all
[9:59] your heart if you'll do it at least one
[10:00] or two or three people for a witness
[10:03] God bless you
[10:04] now father God
[10:07] this is totally out of the hands of any
[10:09] man
[10:11] it'd have to be Supernatural phenomenal
[10:15] so I pray that you'll help me now Lord
[10:17] I'm in your hands
[10:19] do with me as you see fit
[10:23] in Jesus name amen
[10:29] uh don't be nervous
[10:32] just humbly reverely say Lord I'll serve
[10:35] you
[10:36] and that'll be a truth that if I can
[10:38] touch your garment then you speak back
[10:40] through that man
[10:42] that will prove to me that what he said
[10:44] is the truth
[10:46] is that right
[10:50] how many ever seen a picture of that
[10:51] line
[10:52] it's all over the country everywhere
[10:55] science is targets examine it never
[10:57] worked now he's right here now

[11:48] do you believe
[11:49] that God your your need of something
[11:53] and you believe that God can reveal to
[11:56] me what your trouble is
