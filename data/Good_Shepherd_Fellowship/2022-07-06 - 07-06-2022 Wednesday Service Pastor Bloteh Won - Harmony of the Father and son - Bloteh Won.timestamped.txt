[43:24] when he said my father my father
[43:26] the

[43:37] uh
[43:39] the thought kind of
[43:41] struck my heart in a different way
[43:44] then i've i've looked at that before

[44:29] journeyton his son
[44:31] am i reading from the right place
[44:33] okay
[44:37] also
[44:38] he bear them teach
[44:40] the children of judah how to use the
[44:42] ball behold it is written
[44:45] in the book of joshua
[44:48] the beauty of israel is slain upon the
[44:50] high place places how are the mighty
[44:54] falling
[44:55] telling that in gabe published it net in
[44:58] the street
[45:00] of ascalon leaves the daughter so the
[45:02] philistines rejoice leaves the daughters
[45:04] of their own second size triangle
[45:08] a mountain of geboa let there be no deal
[45:12] neither let there be rain upon you
[45:17] know fields of offering
[45:19] for there the sheet of the mighty
[45:22] is vitally cast away in the the the
[45:25] sheet of salt as though
[45:28] he had not been anointed with oil
[45:34] from the blood of the slain from the fat
[45:36] of the mighty
[45:38] the board of journalists and turned
[45:40] knocked back
[45:42] and the swall of saul returned that
[45:45] empty
[45:46] i want you to pay attention to this
[45:49] saul and jonathan
[45:51] were lovely and pleasant
[45:54] in their life
[45:57] and in their death they were not divided
[46:03] they were
[46:05] swifter than ego
[46:07] they were stronger than lion now if you
[46:10] bring it over to the anointing of the
[46:12] church age is the alpha and omega
[46:15] [Music]
[46:17] that's what i want us to keep our
[46:18] thoughts because that's what i will be
[46:20] dwelling tonight
[46:24] here daughters of israel weep over saul
[46:27] who clothed you with scallop
[46:31] with all of the lights who put an
[46:33] ornament of gold
[46:35] upon your appearance how are the mighty
[46:39] falling
[46:40] in the midst of battle old jonathan
[46:43] thou was slain in the in high place
[46:47] praise the lord
[46:49] amen
[46:50] i've
[46:52] used this verse 26 many times over the
[46:54] years to preach
[46:56] i am distressed for thee my brother
[46:58] jonathan very pleasant have thou been
[47:00] unto me that love to me
[47:02] was wonderful passing the love of women
[47:05] that shows that there was a there was
[47:07] agape love that was
[47:09] existing between
[47:12] john intern and david
[47:15] because the love
[47:17] of a woman
[47:18] is feel your love
[47:20] so david is saying your love past the
[47:22] love of a woman
[47:24] and and then in first samuel the bible
[47:26] says the first time they met their soul
[47:29] knock one after another

[48:25] there's brother great brother josh and
[48:27] sister grace
[48:29] so every time we see them we look for
[48:31] more waiting to happen
[48:35] praise the lord
[48:36] amen so it's always an honor when we
[48:39] when we have when we have our vote for
[48:41] you with us praise the lord
[48:43] amen
[48:44] well tonight i want to talk on the
[48:46] harmony between the father and the son
[48:50] brother branham said that in the church
[48:52] age book
[48:53] he says notice the program with church
[48:56] age he said notice the harmony of the
[48:58] father and the son jesus never did
[49:01] anything
[49:02] until it was first shown to him by the
[49:04] father
[49:06] john 5 19 and he says this harmony
[49:10] is known to exist between
[49:13] the groom and the bride i will come back
[49:16] to that amen but i i tied to my my
[49:19] message tonight the harmony be the
[49:22] harmony of the father and the son
[49:26] but i'm gonna i'm gonna go back
[49:29] because
[49:31] what what really
[49:33] what really caught my attention as i was
[49:36] looking at uh
[49:39] illusion lamentation because when elisha
[49:42] said my father my father he was actually
[49:45] lamenting
[49:48] it was almost like jesus saying my god
[49:51] my god
[49:53] now you hear those few words
[49:56] you hear those few words
[49:58] but there is lot that is quoted in that
[50:02] saying
[50:05] and that is the same thing we will see
[50:07] right here
[50:08] david is lamenting when he heard about
[50:11] the the death of saul and johnny turn
[50:15] and out of his lamentation now you out
[50:18] of his cry now you have to remember
[50:21] you have to remember brother branham
[50:23] said that
[50:25] those hebrew mothers
[50:28] when they were about
[50:30] to uh
[50:31] to to birth their their their son
[50:34] in travail and birth pains
[50:39] they cry out
[50:42] okay
[50:43] they cry out and and prophesying what
[50:47] that child will be
[50:51] okay but then if you look at look at it
[50:53] also you realize that uh
[50:56] uh uh uh the father
[50:59] in his death
[51:00] jacob in his death
[51:03] positionally placed
[51:05] those sons
[51:07] right
[51:08] he called every one of them he blessed
[51:11] him
[51:12] and he positionally placed what has been
[51:15] prophesied
[51:17] of them
[51:20] are we together
[51:22] amen
[51:24] now uh uh
[51:26] uh a child being prophesied over i mean
[51:29] uh uh in child birth uh uh
[51:34] even though he's he's uh he's he's he's
[51:37] honored that prophecy
[51:40] but he has to be rightly placed
[51:46] praise the lord
[51:47] say for example this is almost like many
[51:50] that has run into conflict you know when
[51:52] brother branham holds a little baby and
[51:55] say lord bless this little boy and and
[51:58] and uh his name is jeremiah bless little
[52:01] jeremiah lord may he be a preacher
[52:04] you know brahm is dedicating his child
[52:08] and he's saying over the child may he be
[52:10] a preacher maybe a man of god
[52:13] now that's a prophecy
[52:15] now the mother can say well brother and
[52:17] prophesy or my child and he will be a
[52:19] preacher
[52:21] praise the lord boyd i mean now brother
[52:23] i'm saying you'll be a preacher you
[52:24] better forget about that college thing
[52:26] you are thinking about the prophet said
[52:27] you'll be a preacher
[52:32] the lord now if that child
[52:35] is not gathered
[52:37] and and and that and those words just
[52:39] hang over his mind it could misplace him
[52:44] that's right
[52:46] praise the lord
[52:49] it will misplace him
[52:53] because even though the prophet said is
[52:56] there but the child must be gathered the
[52:58] child must be trained and at a
[53:00] particular time that child must be
[53:02] rightly placed
[53:06] think about even even david being led he
[53:10] was anointed when samuel came there
[53:13] samia was not joking he talked he took
[53:15] the oil and he anointed him as a king
[53:19] even though he was anointed as a king
[53:22] but he needed to be trained
[53:27] he needed to be trained he needed to
[53:29] grow and at a point of time he needed to
[53:32] be placed
[53:38] praise the lord
[53:40] even though he was blessed with the
[53:42] slain and and he knew how to throw the
[53:45] slain he was blessed with that but that
[53:47] was not enough for him to lead a kingdom
[53:54] it was not enough
[53:58] are we together
[54:00] now so there is there is something
[54:03] there is something in lamentation
[54:08] there is something in lamentation when
[54:10] you hear the person this morning or the
[54:13] person is lamenting uh they could be
[54:15] saying one word like oh my god oh my god
[54:19] oh my god oh my god it's all you are
[54:21] hearing you all you hear is oh my god
[54:24] but from the heart of that person there
[54:26] are a lot of words that is going on
[54:29] [Music]
[54:35] praise the
[54:36] lord now another thing i want for us to
[54:39] notice is the other
[54:42] uh
[54:43] for some reason
[54:46] almighty god
[54:48] by his own design
[54:52] never
[54:54] make an account of of what david is
[54:57] saying here is never accountable in the
[55:01] life of saul
[55:05] for that reason
[55:08] for that reason you see that is the
[55:10] reason why
[55:12] you know uh uh uh uh uh brother brown
[55:15] was was was was right on the scripture
[55:18] to to to to teach us and let us know
[55:20] that saul was not lost
[55:24] you have to know that saul never came to
[55:27] power by a political means
[55:31] he never came to power by a political
[55:34] means he never went around campaigning
[55:36] he was not even thinking about it
[55:40] that's right
[55:41] when samuel anointed him he says am i
[55:43] not a benjamite because he knew that the
[55:46] the uh of prophecy that the king must
[55:49] come from from judah
[55:52] so he even questioned it
[55:58] praise the lord
[55:59] amen
[56:01] so this this idea of of always painting
[56:05] saul
[56:06] as an evil man
[56:08] is is is is
[56:11] is a sense of our fallen nature
[56:14] the sense of the fault is that we are
[56:17] easier to lean on the negative than the
[56:19] positive
[56:23] that's what our sinful nature would do
[56:25] to us it will it will always make also
[56:27] see the most wasting there to see the
[56:29] good things that are happening around us
[56:32] they will always want us to see the the
[56:34] evil thing about somebody than to even
[56:37] find a single good i was listening to
[56:39] something today it just blessed my heart
[56:42] what makes life balance is that to every
[56:46] negative thing there is a positive thing
[56:52] absolutely to every good thing you see
[56:55] right beside
[56:57] there is a bad thing
[57:03] that's what make life balance
[57:10] but our falling nature will always lean
[57:13] us the first thing we will the first
[57:15] thing that our first
[57:17] falling reaction
[57:21] will be to comment on the danger
[57:26] before later on we think the angels of
[57:28] the law are income about us
[57:33] we will first comment on the danger
[57:40] let me say lord send your angel you
[57:42] don't have to tell him
[57:45] you don't have to tell him
[57:49] that his first response your first
[57:50] response is negative god first respond
[57:53] is always positive
[58:02] so
[58:03] god in in in his wisdom
[58:10] kept these things
[58:12] this beauty of
[58:14] saul and jonathan
[58:20] the scripture account that saw that when
[58:23] when the people were saying so okay the
[58:25] thousand dedicated at ten thousand you
[58:27] see like like like the prophet said that
[58:29] you know the the word is written in
[58:31] between the lines
[58:33] it shows that there were battles that
[58:35] saw one
[58:38] when he first came to power
[58:41] there were battles that he won
[58:45] if you study the scripture you go in the
[58:47] book of chronicles you'll realize that
[58:50] the benjamites were very good to the
[58:53] ball
[58:54] [Music]
[58:56] they were very good they don't miss
[59:02] they were very good to the ball
[59:09] whether it was a troubled thing or or
[59:12] whatever it is but i mean they were very
[59:14] good to the ball maybe johnny turned uh
[59:17] or uh uh benjamin learned that uh
[59:20] knowing that his his uh his brother
[59:22] joseph uh you know uh they had a story
[59:25] that a beast hit his brother so maybe he
[59:28] just trained himself i won't have no
[59:30] beast come around me name he just threw
[59:32] himself to the ball
[59:34] but the benjamins were very good to the
[59:36] ball
[59:42] and god
[59:45] kept this that in the lamentation of
[59:48] devi
[59:50] over the death of saul
[59:52] we will have some records
[59:58] praise the lord
[1:00:01] that we help us to appreciate
[1:00:04] saul
[1:00:08] praise the lord
[1:00:15] and david
[1:00:17] lamenting here
[1:00:25] the beauty of israel
[1:00:31] in other
[1:00:37] art of translation is the beauty and the
[1:00:39] ornament
[1:00:40] they were looking at
[1:00:42] saul and jonathan as the beauty and the
[1:00:45] ornament of israel
[1:00:50] they are they are works
[1:00:54] they are works
[1:00:56] what the date
[1:00:59] the glory that they brought the glory
[1:01:01] that they restore you have to realize
[1:01:04] that
[1:01:05] israel came through a time of the judges
[1:01:08] where they were greatly despised
[1:01:11] why because they never had a man there
[1:01:14] as a king
[1:01:19] so they were they were greatly despised
[1:01:20] they were taken advantage of even though
[1:01:23] god was their king but you have to
[1:01:25] realize that they disobeyed the voice of
[1:01:28] joshua they never drove the people out
[1:01:30] god said there will always be a tone in
[1:01:32] your flesh praise the lord
[1:01:35] and god will always raise up a judge
[1:01:37] when israel is getting into their last
[1:01:41] dark moment
[1:01:42] a man will rise on the scene
[1:01:45] but now for israel to have a king
[1:01:49] for israel to have a king
[1:01:55] that can defend him
[1:01:59] a king that can command the armies
[1:02:04] so almost saw
[1:02:07] there was
[1:02:08] there was a glory that he restored back
[1:02:10] to israel
[1:02:13] you have to realize that israel had a
[1:02:15] glory
[1:02:18] before moses died
[1:02:22] the nations around knew that these
[1:02:24] people were led
[1:02:27] with with a supernatural sign there was
[1:02:30] a pillar of fire that was leading
[1:02:32] him rehab testified about it she said we
[1:02:36] have heard about your god
[1:02:39] how he opened the mighty red sea so
[1:02:42] israel had a glory
[1:02:44] but after joshua died and the people
[1:02:47] never taking to the to the to the word
[1:02:50] of joshua the glory of israel starts to
[1:02:53] fade away
[1:02:56] praise the lord
[1:02:58] so
[1:02:59] david in his lamentation
[1:03:02] what he's expressing
[1:03:06] he's saying also
[1:03:09] you restore the glory that that was once
[1:03:17] with our fathers
[1:03:22] before saul got in into his spare of of
[1:03:25] jealousy
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:29] the philistines would have sent goliath
[1:03:32] if they did not know that israel had an
[1:03:35] army
[1:03:36] right
[1:03:39] if they just thought that israel could
[1:03:41] be run over they would not send a
[1:03:43] goliath
[1:03:45] that's right
[1:03:46] the goliath goliath was the best man in
[1:03:50] their team
[1:03:51] so that's the reason why he was
[1:03:53] demanding let israel bring out your best
[1:03:57] man
[1:04:02] so as david is
[1:04:10] lamenting he's now only thinking
[1:04:14] about saul and jonathan
[1:04:17] as their person
[1:04:19] he's thinking about
[1:04:21] what they have achieved
[1:04:23] what have been done
[1:04:25] through them
[1:04:30] praise the lord
[1:04:36] are we together tonight
[1:04:44] he says don't don't let the philistines
[1:04:46] to hear it
[1:04:49] because they might take advantage
[1:04:59] from the blood of this of of the slain
[1:05:01] and the fat of the mighty the ball of
[1:05:04] jonathan
[1:05:05] turn that
[1:05:06] back can you you remember that in the
[1:05:09] psalm when david
[1:05:10] went away from the feast
[1:05:13] and he told jonathan he said if your if
[1:05:15] your father is angry shoot me the ball
[1:05:19] it was something that was part of them
[1:05:26] it was something that was part of them
[1:05:30] i'm building to something i might just i
[1:05:32] want to i want to wrap your mind in this
[1:05:34] story
[1:05:37] next time when we talk about saul
[1:05:39] we were we would we will have some
[1:05:41] respect to it
[1:05:43] sure because golly men do make mistakes
[1:05:51] and the mistake of a godly man is not
[1:05:54] his condemnation to hell
[1:06:02] those are the divine
[1:06:04] revered truth that a prophet was sent
[1:06:07] yes sir
[1:06:09] praise the lord because we will not we
[1:06:11] will not hold the honor of the word
[1:06:14] if we learn to talk disrespectfully
[1:06:17] of men that god used
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:22] amen
[1:06:24] that's what he says if
[1:06:26] you don't like the man just respect his
[1:06:27] office just for his office sake
[1:06:29] just respect it
[1:06:33] because that's how god sees his men
[1:06:37] for the matter of fact that's how god
[1:06:39] sees his children
[1:06:47] are we together
[1:06:54] your daughters of israel we've oversaw
[1:06:59] who clothed you with scarlett
[1:07:01] which means he brought you to a royal
[1:07:04] place
[1:07:06] he restored the dignity of israel that's
[1:07:09] what he means
[1:07:26] and with all of the lights he put
[1:07:28] ornament of gold
[1:07:32] on your appearance
[1:07:35] now it's not that he was he was there
[1:07:38] you know uh uh uh going over to to best
[1:07:42] buy and or going over to all the
[1:07:44] shopping centers and buying clothes for
[1:07:45] the people know
[1:07:48] david
[1:07:49] was describing
[1:07:51] what the the ministry the leadership
[1:07:55] of saul
[1:07:59] brought to israel
[1:08:06] praise the lord
[1:08:10] so when when david said
[1:08:13] this is the laws anointed
[1:08:16] amen
[1:08:18] when he says this is the law's anointing
[1:08:20] and he will not uh he will not slay the
[1:08:22] laws anointed
[1:08:28] well you can think about it it's a time
[1:08:30] of war his life is being haunted
[1:08:36] and i also believe that that that that
[1:08:39] god was guiding him
[1:08:41] in that
[1:08:43] sure
[1:08:48] but like we all have preached right here
[1:08:51] on this on this subject this should be
[1:08:53] the time where david should have
[1:08:55] rejoiced glory be to god my enemy is
[1:08:58] dead
[1:08:59] sure my god
[1:09:01] now i can have a good sleep
[1:09:06] but the bible says he rented his claws
[1:09:11] and he yelled
[1:09:13] oh so oh
[1:09:15] johnnyton
[1:09:22] praise the lord
[1:09:27] but what is beautiful
[1:09:29] yeah like i said we try to calm down two
[1:09:31] days
[1:09:33] what is beautiful year is the other
[1:09:37] verse 23 sword and journalism were
[1:09:39] lovely
[1:09:40] and blessing
[1:09:42] in their life
[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:46] praise the lord
[1:09:51] they were lovely and blessing you and
[1:09:54] you you you can tell you know you can
[1:09:56] tell that i mean uh uh because because
[1:09:59] uh a janitor never said an evil word to
[1:10:02] david we all look at jonathan to be more
[1:10:05] nicer than his father his father was
[1:10:07] cruel he threw a javelin on david
[1:10:11] he was a wicked man full of jealousy
[1:10:14] and that's all we see
[1:10:17] but david as a boy he lived in the house
[1:10:21] of soul
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:24] yeah
[1:10:27] i don't believe that saul kept him in
[1:10:29] the bound to sleep
[1:10:32] this was the king
[1:10:36] even the bomb would be a royal place to
[1:10:37] sleep
[1:10:39] so i believe saul gave him a good room
[1:10:43] he was farewell he came he ate at the
[1:10:45] table
[1:10:46] they never gave him food under the table
[1:10:49] he experienced the pleasiness of saul
[1:10:54] he said they were pleasing they were
[1:10:56] good to be around
[1:11:04] they were good to be around
[1:11:07] so you you see that is the thing when
[1:11:09] you can be able to separate a man from
[1:11:12] his evil
[1:11:14] you will have no bitterness in you
[1:11:20] amen
[1:11:21] when you can separate a man from his
[1:11:23] wrong
[1:11:26] and send that wrong back to the devil
[1:11:28] identifier that is of the devil is from
[1:11:31] here
[1:11:33] but abraham says when you come to that
[1:11:35] place you will feel so sorry for your
[1:11:37] brother oh god help my brother i know
[1:11:40] he's a good man
[1:11:41] i know he really don't mean
[1:11:46] it amen
[1:12:01] but sometimes this
[1:12:02] is uh
[1:12:04] it's our own evil that is in us that we
[1:12:07] are consumed about
[1:12:09] when we get better with people
[1:12:12] even even the mention of their name
[1:12:14] is just like oh we bring goosebumps it
[1:12:17] looks like an evil spirit
[1:12:19] is it's just something that you are
[1:12:21] sitting in
[1:12:22] that you need to rise above
[1:12:26] rise above
[1:12:28] and get some fresh
[1:12:37] saul and jonathan were lovely
[1:12:40] and pleasant in their lives
[1:12:44] and in their death they were not divided
[1:12:50] now
[1:12:51] david is going to now describe
[1:12:54] the driving force
[1:12:57] that was behind their ministry
[1:13:05] the harmony
[1:13:07] of the father
[1:13:08] and the son
[1:13:11] he is now going to describe
[1:13:14] the driving force that was behind their
[1:13:16] ministry
[1:13:20] they were swifter than ego
[1:13:23] they were stronger than lion i mean this
[1:13:26] this was not just
[1:13:28] he was not just praising them
[1:13:31] now we have to realize this is the
[1:13:33] inspired word of god
[1:13:37] this is this is elohim's thoughts
[1:13:43] praise the
[1:13:44] lord this is elohim tops
[1:13:49] so behind
[1:13:51] what saul did for israel
[1:13:56] the anointing that was behind the man
[1:13:59] yeah
[1:14:01] praise the lord because we we have to
[1:14:03] realize that uh uh the the anointing of
[1:14:07] the ages never only started with that
[1:14:10] with the church ages
[1:14:13] amen because when adam and eve broke the
[1:14:17] word
[1:14:18] what did god put in the garden cherubim
[1:14:21] right that's right
[1:14:23] to god the way back to the truth of life
[1:14:25] and that cherubim has always represented
[1:14:28] the anointing
[1:14:30] that we guide a man in the path of god
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:40] so every son every son of every age
[1:14:44] every messenger
[1:14:48] was on the one of
[1:14:51] the four anointing
[1:14:56] because that's the anointing around the
[1:14:58] throne
[1:14:59] that's the powerhouse of god
[1:15:02] if god would do anything on earth
[1:15:05] it would be true
[1:15:07] that the the the the powerhouse of one
[1:15:10] of those anointing
[1:15:16] that's the reason why god will give men
[1:15:19] uh the grace to go and and and and lay
[1:15:23] down their life
[1:15:26] look at the look at the sacrificial
[1:15:29] expression of gephthal
[1:15:32] lord if you give me this bottle the
[1:15:34] first thing that run out of my house
[1:15:36] i was sacrificed not even thinking
[1:15:39] right right
[1:15:42] why he was on a an ox anointing sure
[1:15:47] it was a man that was ready to sacrifice
[1:15:50] his life all the life of anything that
[1:15:53] is dear to him right
[1:15:56] right
[1:15:59] so the the anointing
[1:16:03] around the throne is not only unique to
[1:16:07] the to the new testament church
[1:16:10] ezekiel saw the same around the truth
[1:16:16] they were called the living creatures
[1:16:19] they have been there brother branham
[1:16:20] said uh uh uh uh uh revelation chapter
[1:16:24] four
[1:16:25] series brother branham said it was the
[1:16:27] same thing the prophet of god said it
[1:16:29] depends where they were looking he said
[1:16:31] when moses saw the same cherubim it had
[1:16:34] a flaming sword in eating
[1:16:37] he said it was the same thing that
[1:16:39] ezekiel saw
[1:16:41] they were all looking at the same thing
[1:16:43] but from different place
[1:16:47] he says he said that is the thing that
[1:16:50] gathered the church right from eden to
[1:16:52] the throne of god
[1:16:55] as being the fall anointing guarding
[1:16:58] god's
[1:17:00] purpose god in god's plan of redemption
[1:17:11] are we together
[1:17:16] right from eden
[1:17:18] he said when joe saw
[1:17:20] the same living creature they were they
[1:17:22] were before the throne
[1:17:26] so moses saw the the the the the church
[1:17:31] from the beginning of his joining
[1:17:34] when they stepped out of eden
[1:17:37] john saw them or saw us when we have
[1:17:41] arrived
[1:17:43] and it will all be under the protection
[1:17:46] of these four living creatures
[1:17:52] even when israel went to battle i will
[1:17:55] show you a picture uh sometime when they
[1:17:58] went to battle that was how they
[1:18:01] positioned himself
[1:18:07] there were one trap
[1:18:09] in the north
[1:18:10] and that tribe was under
[1:18:13] one of the anointing that was their
[1:18:16] emblem
[1:18:19] there was one in the south one west and
[1:18:21] east
[1:18:23] and it was just representing
[1:18:26] the full anointing around the throne
[1:18:33] praise the lord
[1:18:39] amen
[1:18:43] if god
[1:18:44] all that god did all through the ages
[1:18:51] you see that's the reason why even when
[1:18:53] it comes down to the ministry which of
[1:18:55] course we will get there if not today
[1:18:57] maybe on sunday if now sunday another
[1:18:59] time
[1:19:00] when
[1:19:01] when even it comes down to the ministry
[1:19:03] it is not just flipping the pages and
[1:19:06] speaking
[1:19:09] you have to know
[1:19:10] on a wish of this anointing you are
[1:19:13] operating
[1:19:21] because that's that's what makes a man
[1:19:23] to yield
[1:19:25] that's what that's what it means of of
[1:19:28] of getting out of the way
[1:19:32] praise the lord
[1:19:35] i can see brother george preaching and
[1:19:37] admire the way he preaching it and try
[1:19:39] to imitate
[1:19:40] after him it will not work
[1:19:45] because he comes with his nature
[1:19:48] and all he does is that he recognize
[1:19:51] that that anointing that is beyond him
[1:19:53] he recognized that that living creature
[1:19:56] that is behind and he steps out of the
[1:19:58] way and a living creature a man can
[1:20:01] stand right here
[1:20:02] with his glasses on his face
[1:20:05] laying on this pulpit just like that
[1:20:07] without moving
[1:20:09] and he can preach the most powerful
[1:20:11] semen
[1:20:14] he don't have to be jumping around just
[1:20:16] like i do
[1:20:21] praise the lord
[1:20:22] so you see if the people are feeding on
[1:20:25] the emotion
[1:20:27] then they get lost
[1:20:29] they fall asleep
[1:20:32] but when the people are attracted to the
[1:20:34] world that anointing comes down it
[1:20:36] connects you to the world
[1:20:39] you get in that channel even if the man
[1:20:42] sits down you will still be blessed
[1:20:53] because it's the anointing that does the
[1:20:55] work
[1:20:58] praise the lord
[1:21:13] now so david comes to this place
[1:21:20] and he's been he's been able to have the
[1:21:22] grace
[1:21:25] to identify
[1:21:29] what brought the pleasantness
[1:21:32] of these two men
[1:21:40] are we together
[1:21:45] david and trinity
[1:21:49] they were swift like eagles
[1:21:51] they were strong
[1:21:53] like lions
[1:22:01] praise the lord
[1:22:03] amen
[1:22:04] i believe i believe check it for me
[1:22:09] i believe that that that's all
[1:22:14] in the way he was called
[1:22:18] and and for what god wanted to do just
[1:22:21] just imagine
[1:22:23] he's anointed by the prophet
[1:22:26] i mean
[1:22:28] even though he's struggling within
[1:22:31] himself it's it's
[1:22:33] it's i'm a benjamite oh my god
[1:22:36] i came out here to look for my father
[1:22:38] you know uh uh uh you know
[1:22:41] and all of that now take take the
[1:22:43] picture in your mind now
[1:22:45] i mean
[1:22:47] he went out to look for
[1:22:50] a lost eyes of his father
[1:22:56] he was doing the work of an evangelist
[1:23:00] [Laughter]
[1:23:03] not desiring to be a minister but he's
[1:23:05] trying to look for law source
[1:23:12] are you seeing the picture i'm trying to
[1:23:13] build a picture here
[1:23:18] something was ah
[1:23:20] a divine destiny that was driving him
[1:23:22] that he had no idea about yes sir
[1:23:26] but he ever said he met the the prophet
[1:23:29] the prophet anointed him to be king
[1:23:32] and it's not too long he's prophesying
[1:23:35] among the prophets
[1:23:37] and it's becoming strange to everybody
[1:23:39] as poor as they saw a prophet
[1:23:48] is he normal among the prophet he's
[1:23:49] prophesying oh my god
[1:23:56] praise the lord
[1:23:59] and i believe it is all of those early
[1:24:02] experience they are so hard
[1:24:05] that that that had the people to trust
[1:24:08] in him
[1:24:11] praise the lord
[1:24:13] so our owners started losing favor with
[1:24:15] the people when it was a change when it
[1:24:18] was time for the change of disposition
[1:24:26] praise the lord
[1:24:27] amen
[1:24:30] when a man coming to the end of it of
[1:24:32] his ministry and he don't know how to
[1:24:34] stop
[1:24:36] right
[1:24:39] he still want to be he still want to be
[1:24:41] that same uh
[1:24:42] uh energetic he still want to have you
[1:24:45] know uh uh want to keep the people then
[1:24:48] he start running into error he starts
[1:24:50] saying things to impress the people just
[1:24:52] to gain their favor and all of that
[1:24:55] then you know something something is
[1:24:57] wrong
[1:25:02] but the lord allows all to have such a
[1:25:06] you know
[1:25:07] an experience
[1:25:09] right
[1:25:10] when the people were saying they saw
[1:25:11] them on the prophet they were not saying
[1:25:13] it in the wrong way
[1:25:15] no
[1:25:17] they were saying it in a good way oh wow
[1:25:20] now we have a king
[1:25:21] i mean he's not only political but he's
[1:25:23] prophesying
[1:25:25] sure
[1:25:35] praise the lord
[1:25:44] are we together
[1:25:47] you know it's it's uh
[1:25:50] it's uh
[1:25:52] yeah i've always blessed my heart
[1:25:55] when i think about saul a benjaminite
[1:25:58] again in the new testament church
[1:26:04] saw a benjamite
[1:26:06] later on become paul the apostle
[1:26:09] he was saw a benjamite
[1:26:14] praise the lord
[1:26:17] sir
[1:26:20] i will have you to go and chew on that
[1:26:21] one a little bit
[1:26:25] are we together
[1:26:26] but this is what i want to come down to
[1:26:28] here
[1:26:29] uh as we as we look at this
[1:26:31] like i said i'm trying to build
[1:26:33] something here
[1:26:35] when i go into elijah
[1:26:37] any larger you will you will have a
[1:26:39] clear understanding
[1:26:41] you know because
[1:26:45] now the one thing i also want to say i'm
[1:26:47] talking about the harmony of the father
[1:26:50] and the son
[1:26:54] when david went and cut saw garmin
[1:26:58] he stood on the hell he yelled
[1:27:00] what the sauce said my son
[1:27:06] so called him my son
[1:27:11] so there was that relationship
[1:27:14] that was between saul and david it was
[1:27:17] like a father
[1:27:19] and a son
[1:27:20] right
[1:27:24] praise the lord
[1:27:28] now you have to remember branham says
[1:27:30] that same harmony
[1:27:33] will return back
[1:27:36] to the church
[1:27:39] between
[1:27:41] christ the bridegroom
[1:27:44] and the church the bride
[1:27:51] praise the lord
[1:27:54] that's that's what we that's what we are
[1:27:56] laboring together to be able to see
[1:27:58] tonight that's what i want you to see
[1:28:00] jesus said i did nothing
[1:28:02] on on on unless what the father told me
[1:28:06] what the father revealed to me
[1:28:08] over and over brother branham used that
[1:28:10] in his ministry
[1:28:12] to grab our attention
[1:28:15] because it was something that was
[1:28:17] supposed to be restored back to the
[1:28:19] church yes
[1:28:21] adam did only what the father told him
[1:28:24] right
[1:28:28] there was a there was a harmony between
[1:28:30] the father and the son in eden
[1:28:35] that everything that some did the father
[1:28:38] was pleased
[1:28:39] right that's
[1:28:41] that's right
[1:28:44] praise the lord
[1:28:47] amen everything that someday the father
[1:28:50] was pleased the the the return of the
[1:28:53] holy ghost the opening of the seals is
[1:28:55] to bring us to that place
[1:29:00] of pleasing god
[1:29:04] which is a place of faith
[1:29:07] there's a place of rapture in faith
[1:29:10] that's what the rapture in faith is
[1:29:14] a place of a groaning desire to please
[1:29:18] god
[1:29:24] that's the harmony
[1:29:31] so i'll say oh my son david
[1:29:34] where have you been
[1:29:37] oh david
[1:29:39] oh david where have you been
[1:29:44] just try to imagine
[1:29:46] the harmony that once existed between
[1:29:49] them
[1:29:50] when david played the hop
[1:29:56] and saw with our honor
[1:29:59] that anointed
[1:30:17] swift of an
[1:30:18] eagle
[1:30:20] stronger than lion
[1:30:23] lion was
[1:30:26] the alpha anointing
[1:30:28] was the the anointing
[1:30:31] for the first three church ages
[1:30:35] it was honored that anointing great
[1:30:37] missionary work was done
[1:30:41] those apostles were they were they were
[1:30:43] bulldozing gates they were going over
[1:30:45] seed i mean they were traveling the
[1:30:48] gospel was spreading everywhere
[1:30:51] that's the anointing that was on the
[1:30:54] first three church ages
[1:30:58] it was the lion's anointing
[1:31:02] are we together
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:07] and then the ox anointing was on the
[1:31:10] fourth age
[1:31:12] which is the dark age
[1:31:16] it was an ox
[1:31:17] an an an animal of sacrifice
[1:31:22] but said in a seal he said wash the
[1:31:24] church she can do no more than what
[1:31:28] she's anointed to do
[1:31:34] that's right
[1:31:36] amen
[1:31:39] are we together
[1:31:43] so under the dark age
[1:31:45] that was the anointing that was on the
[1:31:47] on the on the edge
[1:31:48] that was the anointing of the age
[1:31:52] the age of persecution i mean those
[1:31:54] people were burned to the stick they
[1:31:55] were praising god
[1:31:59] they were not afraid of the of the lion
[1:32:01] then
[1:32:06] praise the lord so it was a proud it was
[1:32:09] a glory
[1:32:15] young men and women
[1:32:16] did their wedding just before they were
[1:32:19] fair to the lions
[1:32:21] sure
[1:32:22] their honeymoon was to be fair to the
[1:32:24] lions
[1:32:28] that was the anointing that was on them
[1:32:39] if a young man was after the war a young
[1:32:41] girl that was that was that was
[1:32:43] dedicated in her faith
[1:32:45] and since you see the persecution on the
[1:32:47] church let's run away that young girl
[1:32:49] knew very aware that this man does not
[1:32:52] have a good faith i don't want you if
[1:32:54] you were not stand to die for christ
[1:32:56] don't show up yet again
[1:32:59] because she was under the anointing
[1:33:02] that was the anointing that was on the
[1:33:04] edge
[1:33:12] praise the lord
[1:33:16] having won one testimony there in the uh
[1:33:20] uh the uh the underground church
[1:33:23] you know uh uh and uh in this this woman
[1:33:26] says uh i mean you you you are not faith
[1:33:28] to be my husband if you cannot stand for
[1:33:30] the name of christ
[1:33:33] well i'm just only trying to do it for
[1:33:35] you and it says if you can't do it for
[1:33:37] christ it's not enough for me
[1:33:42] that's the anointing they were honored
[1:33:45] they were bored they were born to die
[1:33:55] because that was the anointing of the
[1:33:57] age yes
[1:34:04] praise the lord
[1:34:05] we are both denied both to run
[1:34:09] very bold to change our mind
[1:34:14] but they were both to die
[1:34:25] we are following the water release
[1:34:30] resistance we're in the path of least
[1:34:33] resistance sure we don't want no
[1:34:35] pressure
[1:34:36] we just want to ride on the wave
[1:34:39] we are going in the rapture that way
[1:34:43] glory be to god
[1:34:49] but that was the that was the anointing
[1:34:51] that was on that age
[1:34:53] and on the fifth and the sixth age
[1:34:56] it was the mains anointing
[1:34:59] that's the reason why
[1:35:01] if you want if you want to read good
[1:35:04] christian materials
[1:35:05] not joe austin
[1:35:10] you want to read good christian material
[1:35:12] go back and read
[1:35:15] men that wrote
[1:35:17] during this time
[1:35:19] sure that's right
[1:35:22] peregrine progress
[1:35:26] those those were they were honored they
[1:35:28] were honored and anointing they could
[1:35:30] pick up their pain
[1:35:33] and right
[1:35:35] right from the heart of god
[1:35:37] right yes sure
[1:35:42] that's what that's the anointing that
[1:35:44] was on them
[1:35:45] that's what luther who did what he did
[1:35:49] because that's anointing that was on it
[1:35:50] was immense anointing
[1:35:52] right and we always try sometimes we we
[1:35:55] get in the wrong place where we look at
[1:35:57] it as wrong you know that is nothing
[1:36:00] it's intellectual age
[1:36:03] no god was blessing the intellectual man
[1:36:06] it was not perverted it was not it was
[1:36:09] it was not deceitful
[1:36:18] it was the ih
[1:36:27] praise the lord
[1:36:28] that's the reason why a prophet could
[1:36:30] come and go back and read uh a a a true
[1:36:35] babylon and read all of these books
[1:36:37] right sure
[1:36:40] verb says i was just said in true
[1:36:42] history church history
[1:36:45] those were men that lived around those
[1:36:47] times
[1:36:48] right
[1:37:04] you well i would have said
[1:37:07] let me just stay right here
[1:37:10] because my mind is starting to go all
[1:37:12] over the place now
[1:37:20] and there's a fourth anointing here
[1:37:24] which is
[1:37:26] the eagles anointing
[1:37:32] there was the seventh
[1:37:34] rupturing anointing as fly as as high as
[1:37:38] the ego can fly
[1:37:40] amen
[1:37:43] no wonder we love to sing our fly away
[1:37:49] praise the lord
[1:37:51] i fly away
[1:37:54] but this was the anointing that would
[1:37:57] take the church in the depths of god
[1:38:01] that's why the prophet could come in and
[1:38:03] tell us about the back part of god's
[1:38:05] mind
[1:38:08] talks about the foundation of the word
[1:38:11] yes
[1:38:17] because that's the eagle anointing it
[1:38:19] flies high
[1:38:29] are we together
[1:38:30] now so god
[1:38:33] took
[1:38:34] the the the alpha anointing
[1:38:37] and the omega anointing to restore the
[1:38:41] glory and the beauty of israel
[1:38:46] knowing that israel will go down
[1:38:49] a rough path
[1:38:52] they will go down a rough path they will
[1:38:54] go down into idolatry there is a babylon
[1:38:57] that was waiting for them then and all
[1:38:59] of these things would happen there was a
[1:39:01] jesse bell there would be a and a half
[1:39:03] the king that would have married jesse
[1:39:05] ben and a and and israel would go down a
[1:39:08] dark path right
[1:39:11] right
[1:39:14] but god
[1:39:20] restoring the glory of israel
[1:39:25] it's almost like jesus
[1:39:27] the bible says after his resurrection he
[1:39:30] appeared to the disciple he breathed
[1:39:32] upon them and said receive ye the holy
[1:39:34] ghost
[1:39:37] praise the lord
[1:39:40] but yet there's a pentecost that he
[1:39:42] needed to go to
[1:39:46] for their prophecy to become an
[1:39:48] experience
[1:39:49] yes
[1:39:53] praise the lord
[1:39:56] it's also what god did for us he he he
[1:39:59] provided brethren says this this
[1:40:02] anointing is to protect the church it's
[1:40:04] there he's already provided everything
[1:40:07] that we will go through is right in the
[1:40:09] midst of that right
[1:40:15] praise the lord
[1:40:22] the prophet demonstrated it like this

[1:40:51] lock your hands together
[1:40:53] now this side this is how the four beats
[1:40:55] are
[1:40:57] the church is right in the middle
[1:41:02] that's
[1:41:02] right and brother branham says when the
[1:41:05] beasts move
[1:41:07] if simon is moving
[1:41:09] we all go and support that anointing or
[1:41:12] the rest of this three power is behind
[1:41:15] the lion's anointing
[1:41:19] when the ox is moving
[1:41:22] all the power is behind it
[1:41:27] when the man is moving all the power
[1:41:30] supported right
[1:41:32] amen
[1:41:33] when the ego is moving they all move in
[1:41:36] that direction
[1:41:37] amen
[1:41:41] are we together
[1:41:42] god bless you
[1:41:52] so you see god
[1:41:57] has guaranteed what he's doing
[1:42:02] he's not playing games with our lives we
[1:42:04] playing games with our own lives
[1:42:11] god has fortified his church
[1:42:16] he has empowered his church
[1:42:19] the church is well protected
[1:42:23] praise the lord
[1:42:25] amen the church is well protected
[1:42:28] someone can come with their with their
[1:42:30] with their gossip spirit and thing you
[1:42:32] can sit here and gossip about this
[1:42:33] person and gossip about this other
[1:42:35] person that gossip about this other
[1:42:36] person and then you know run it from one
[1:42:38] person run for one for a while we might
[1:42:40] flow with it sure
[1:42:43] but because the church is protected the
[1:42:46] law will raise up a spirit
[1:42:48] that will expose that the emperor soon
[1:42:51] will realize this person was part of it
[1:42:53] repent this person was part of every
[1:42:55] pain this other person was part of her
[1:42:56] repent
[1:43:03] right
[1:43:05] praise the lord
[1:43:07] yes sir
[1:43:08] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:43:10] brother brahm says stay close
[1:43:13] because the enemy will will sneak in
[1:43:18] yes sir
[1:43:19] he says but if you stay with that word
[1:43:22] yes that person would eat a pack and
[1:43:26] realize that their immoral life had no
[1:43:29] place here
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:33] they would soon realize that these
[1:43:35] people that are here they mean business
[1:43:37] with god
[1:43:38] they are people that want to go to
[1:43:40] heaven
[1:43:54] you hear people they said they're so so
[1:43:56] hypocrite
[1:43:58] they are identifying themselves
[1:44:01] such a hypocrite down there
[1:44:04] sure
[1:44:06] that's exactly what billam was doing
[1:44:08] yeah
[1:44:11] he was speaking on the little weakness
[1:44:14] he could see
[1:44:16] right
[1:44:17] oh billock
[1:44:19] that's what he was doing that's why he
[1:44:21] hired a prophet
[1:44:23] and some people love love
[1:44:26] hiring preachers
[1:44:29] let a preacher come in and start to talk
[1:44:32] and love needs to be preach your brother
[1:44:34] preach it preach it brother
[1:44:38] because the thing there that has an
[1:44:40] opportunity now and bilaam has pointed
[1:44:42] out something in the church right
[1:44:57] praise the lord
[1:45:00] i know by the grace of god
[1:45:02] i'm commissioned to do what i'm doing
[1:45:05] praise the lord
[1:45:07] amen
[1:45:09] and uh
[1:45:10] and you also you i mean
[1:45:13] the the power
[1:45:14] of the local church i mean it's right in
[1:45:16] your hand you can vote me out
[1:45:19] if you don't like my
[1:45:21] my style of leadership you have the
[1:45:22] power to
[1:45:23] you know god designed it in a way that
[1:45:26] the pastor don't choose their members
[1:45:30] you choose your pastor yes yes
[1:45:33] that's the way it is
[1:45:35] so you're having more responsibility to
[1:45:38] take care of me
[1:45:39] than me to take care of you
[1:45:41] because you choose me
[1:45:45] you're having more responsibility to
[1:45:47] pray for me don't expect me to be
[1:45:50] calling you you must be checking on me
[1:45:52] are you doing okay
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:57] you must be taking care of that that is
[1:45:59] that not the way
[1:46:00] it's just a reverse of of of the
[1:46:02] marriage order
[1:46:04] the man assumed that responsibility
[1:46:09] amen because he choose his wife
[1:46:16] but when it comes to this divine order
[1:46:19] god gave you
[1:46:21] the right the power in your hand to
[1:46:24] choose the man that will lead you
[1:46:30] praise the lord
[1:46:32] but you see when you choose me
[1:46:34] then you don't control me
[1:46:41] amen you don't tell me what to preach
[1:46:43] and what not to preach
[1:46:46] amen
[1:46:53] are we together
[1:47:03] now
[1:47:04] it's almost nine teddy i should let you
[1:47:06] go
[1:47:09] and now so
[1:47:11] we see here
[1:47:13] that right from eden
[1:47:16] god has there with his people
[1:47:19] all through the ages the sources of god
[1:47:22] has been the harmony
[1:47:26] between the father
[1:47:28] and the son
[1:47:31] when satan broke the harmony in eating
[1:47:34] we know what happened
[1:47:36] there was chaos
[1:47:40] chaos
[1:47:41] lies death and and everything was
[1:47:43] thinking when he broke that that's what
[1:47:45] he's that's what he's striving for
[1:47:48] when he can break the harmony in the in
[1:47:50] the local church break the harmony in in
[1:47:52] your home
[1:47:54] right
[1:47:55] there will be chaos
[1:47:57] if he can break the harmony in your life
[1:48:01] the harmony that you must have with the
[1:48:03] father the word and prayer and worship
[1:48:07] if he can break that harmony he will run
[1:48:10] you into chaos
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:18] the way the anointing works
[1:48:22] is when there is harmony
[1:48:25] that's the reason why paul in ephesians
[1:48:27] he says we endeavor
[1:48:30] for the unity
[1:48:32] of the spirit
[1:48:37] there will not be a successful unity of
[1:48:39] the faith without the unity of the
[1:48:41] spirit
[1:48:43] what is that is the harmony
[1:48:46] of the father and the son
[1:48:49] the church can do nothing
[1:48:51] until what the father has revealed
[1:48:56] what the father has released upon them
[1:49:03] so you see every man
[1:49:05] every man every prophet
[1:49:12] was the powerhouse
[1:49:15] that the people local
[1:49:18] the kingship in israel was the
[1:49:21] powerhouse when there was a prophet the
[1:49:23] prophet was the powerhouse
[1:49:33] praise the lord
[1:49:36] that was the powerhouse
[1:49:45] are we together
[1:49:49] so david
[1:49:53] was lamenting
[1:49:55] daughters of israel
[1:49:58] don't say this don't don't let don't let
[1:50:00] don't let the philistines hear it
[1:50:03] right
[1:50:15] the protection of israel is gone
[1:50:21] the protection of israel is gone
[1:50:26] if you if you you just think about it
[1:50:32] then you will understand
[1:50:35] why elisha said
[1:50:37] my father
[1:50:38] my father
[1:50:44] you will understand why jesus says my
[1:50:47] god my god
[1:50:55] why have they have forsaken me
[1:51:00] we can run this down
[1:51:02] in the family life
[1:51:05] i like to talk on that one of these days
[1:51:09] but very simple principle simple simple
[1:51:12] principle that god plays right in his
[1:51:15] word very simple principle
[1:51:24] and those those are just keys that god
[1:51:26] placed there
[1:51:28] as we run it down from the spiritual and
[1:51:30] bring it down to our natural life
[1:51:33] you know when when when a family
[1:51:35] you know
[1:51:36] like like the scripture says you know
[1:51:38] the woman must not assault authority
[1:51:42] over the man
[1:51:43] even though paul says that as a divine
[1:51:46] order of the church but that is that is
[1:51:48] how gold mine runs for his family
[1:51:54] when when the church when the when when
[1:51:56] the woman
[1:51:57] or the family in general
[1:52:00] can put
[1:52:01] trust in the leadership
[1:52:03] right of the home
[1:52:06] even if the man is the most dumbest man
[1:52:10] god will bless their family i give you
[1:52:13] the example of abigail
[1:52:17] and never he was a fool
[1:52:19] and the reason why god blessed that home
[1:52:22] is because abigail knew her place
[1:52:26] as a wife
[1:52:28] even though he was a fool
[1:52:32] but she she got under that authority
[1:52:36] it's just a simple principle
[1:52:39] simple principle
[1:52:43] but is god healing in simplicity
[1:52:46] and revealing in the scene
[1:52:55] when when a man when a woman can come to
[1:52:57] that place
[1:53:00] and then and even even you know a vice
[1:53:04] versa you know when a man can come to
[1:53:06] the place
[1:53:08] and realize that
[1:53:11] you know uh uh his responsibility
[1:53:14] to his wife and to his children
[1:53:17] absolutely
[1:53:19] and how
[1:53:20] uh i mean uh uh i mean no matter
[1:53:23] what was what's going in it might not
[1:53:25] even be making sense
[1:53:27] but you know a law of god
[1:53:30] requires you to love her
[1:53:33] and respect her
[1:53:41] sometimes it's not in the great things
[1:53:44] that we do
[1:53:46] it's not in the many hours that we work
[1:53:51] that god bless our family
[1:53:53] is in the obedience
[1:53:55] to god's lord
[1:53:59] because remember
[1:54:01] god is obligated to his word
[1:54:10] god is obligated
[1:54:13] to his word
[1:54:15] the lord bless you tonight let's stand
[1:54:17] on our feet
[1:54:18] we're continuing on sunday
[1:54:20] the lord will allow us to go in that
[1:54:22] direction
[1:54:36] let's just worship the lord lord my
[1:54:38] heart is open
[1:54:48] lord my heart
[1:54:51] is
[1:54:53] [Music]
[1:55:06] just
[1:55:08] love all
[1:55:10] my
[1:55:13] [Music]
[1:55:25] oh

[1:55:41] doors

[1:56:44] oh
[1:56:48] [Music]
[1:57:03] won't you come
[1:57:07] inside
[1:57:17] let's read this before we pray
[1:57:19] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:57:22] son
[1:57:23] jesus never did anything until first
[1:57:29] until it was first shown him by the
[1:57:31] father
[1:57:33] john 5 19 this harmony
[1:57:36] is now to exist between the bride and
[1:57:39] the groom
[1:57:41] he show her his word of life
[1:57:45] she received it
[1:57:47] she never doubted
[1:57:51] therefore nothing can harm her
[1:57:54] not even death
[1:57:58] for if the sea be planted and water
[1:58:03] the water will rise it up again
[1:58:06] here is the secret of this
[1:58:08] here is the secret the word
[1:58:12] is in the bride
[1:58:15] as it was in merit
[1:58:18] the bride has the mind of christ
[1:58:22] for she knows what he wants done
[1:58:25] with the word
[1:58:29] she performed his command
[1:58:33] she performed the command of the word
[1:58:37] in his name as she has thou said the law
[1:58:42] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:58:46] and it come to pass
[1:58:48] i would like to read that again but
[1:58:50] let's just go for tonight i'll come back
[1:58:52] to it
[1:58:55] like a seed that is planted in water
[1:58:59] it comes to four harvests
[1:59:02] serving is purpose
[1:59:06] those in the bride do only his will
[1:59:12] no one can make them do otherwise
[1:59:17] they have just said the lord all they
[1:59:19] will keep still
[1:59:22] they know that it has to be god in them
[1:59:26] doing the works
[1:59:28] fulfilling his own word
[1:59:34] he did not complete his
[1:59:36] all his works were
[1:59:39] in his ethnic ministry so now
[1:59:41] he works in and through the brow
[1:59:46] and the channel
[1:59:49] is the harmony
