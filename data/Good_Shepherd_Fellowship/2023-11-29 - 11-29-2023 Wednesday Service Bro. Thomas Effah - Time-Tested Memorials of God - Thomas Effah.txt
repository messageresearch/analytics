smile the face of Jesus Christ this evening for us to acknowledge what Calvary holds for us let us pray precious Lord we are in a very crucial moment to approach the word of God nobody is worthy to do this job it is your job job it is you that know how to break the bread but father Your Grace has pick men because you can never do without a man and that is why it has fallen our lot to reach your pride with the word of God so tonight father come Among Us in your special way break the bread again as the breading that walk with you miles they recognize you after the breaking of bread I believe we are going to do same if you break it in your special way help us in Jesus Christ name amen okay let us read our test and then maybe you can have your seats turn your Bibles to the Book of Matthew Matthew 24 verse 35 a special test that I believe everyone is familiar with that test Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away may the Lord add blessing to read of his word you can have your seat for now we are thankful that we have got opportunity to be in his presence this where Cain refused to walk but we are privileged to walk in his presence and there is nothing that can pull us away because we are part of him and we have been magnetized to him and when you are magnetized to God I don't see what can pull you apart there's nothing that can pull you away from God so I really appreciate my friend bran brother it's not because you are here bra said what you say at the back of the man say it at his presence don't speak good things when a brother is there and then you speak bad things behind him be bold and tell him to his brother you are not right and if you go behind him you say the same thing if he's good you go behind him say he's good in his present he's good you don't change your that is topic so I appreciate my friend uh I really enjoy the right Spirit anytime I come around brother keep keep it it's a good spirit I appreciate that I'm a missionary like teos I travel a lot so I've seen many things on the field so I know what I'm talking about God bless you my friend bless you too uh we thank the Lord for a successful barrier of and I think everyone of you your contribution was really loable and God bless each one of you and particular particularly this assembly for doing a wonderful job we appreciate what God has used you to do for your brother and God will bless you for all the support that you put in it is not in vain you surely reap God bless you all and uh I thank the pastor for giving me a chance to speak to you briefly so tonight we will just go to the storehouse and pick one of the food the prophet said in Jesus Christ said Christ The Mystery of God reveal yeah in the paragraph 5 there he said I am storing food for the bride and that food that he stored will sustain us for the journey we don't need anything we don't need pull out or add nobody can add to it we don't need anything Brown said he has t food for us so we are picking one of the me tonight time tested Memorials of God time tested Memorials of God this was preached 55 uh 57 is tap number 0818 time tested memorials was saying paragraph 28 says and I was talking about men losing their affections for their wives and don't love them as they did when they were sweetheart shame on you is somebody here like that you ought to do it she is always your sweetheart absolutely that is the part she should be and you should treat her like that oh never let that lyric on the moon cease yes because it isn't going to in heaven going to be just perfectly one that's right that's right and when he spoke to the Breen you turn around and then you spoke to the sisters as well in the message the faith of Abraham paragraph 35 he said now you wom or to love your husbands like that because the Bible says so that's right so much that she call him her Lord that is little Lord now if you do that if you will love your husbands like that and you will honor your your love wives the divorce cause the divor was CAU will go out of business amen that is the way it should be for what God has joined together let know my good I than love is corrective and love conquers everything if you have love you always conquer most of his sermons he explain how God used him tremendous because he love even animals you know the story how he loved them how he show passionate love yeah he said if you want to conquer you must have love yes that is the only tool that you can use to conquer he said your works the your work tells what you are we are talking of that is time tested memorials he said Heaven and Earth shall pass away yes but my word will not pass away that is the only Memorial we can talk about something that will not pass away it stands and it will stand forever and ever because the word is God you see a man's character is made known by his works right wherever you are you are always prove what you are yes no matter how much you testify whether you say Pro or con that has nothing to do it your always tells what you are tells what you are inside every job that you do manifest what you are yes praise the Lord I was in a fness and the pastor took me and when we were going there were many tourists a lot of people were going to that mountain but we have a perfect objective we have a vision we know where we were going yes many people were just walking oh just admiring the place the mountains but we know where we were going yes praise the Lord so talking Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever that is the3 he said you only see what you are looking for if you come here tonight looking for Jesus you will see him yes amen if you come here to criticize you have plenty to criticize amen plenty on your hands to criticize it depends on what you are looking for many people were moving we were moving and a lot of people going to the mountain but we were going to a specific place there's a special place that we had in our mind right so if you're here as a Christian you must have your destination in your mind you are not just here to be a Christian you are not just here to let people see you you are here because you have a destination amen prise the Lord you you must have that in mind time test the memorials the prophet said now look at Moses Moses and Pharaoh he said they use the same window but Moses was seeing predestinated Sons and Daughters of God through that window but Pharaoh used the same you know and he slaves in has what you want to see amen Abraham SE 59 that is what we go to look by faith and see like Moses looking out the same window that Pharaoh did upon the same people Pharaoh called them M duus that is all that he saw just a bunch of slips by faith Moses told them to be the promised people praise the Lord same window you can come and sit here on the seat but you preach this message when the man is falling everybody can grab at that congregation or at that that be beyond the camp there in the you can grab your man but they will go home and they will be hungry again everybody is eating Mana as we here but there are some people that will cross over and get behind the decks where the Mana is available every day it doesn't rot when you move to that Dimension you will feed every day you will never go hungry that is where I want you to be leave the campground mana and come to the holy of Hol right Joshua go told Joshua that Joshua when the priest get to Jordan let them stand still as Jordan part as Jordan part and then they walk on dry land let them stand still and let every tribe the head of each tribe pick a stone under the feet of where the priest stands you don't pick your store anywhere you want to pick but where the PRI is standing that is where you cannot pick any message you cannot but where brother BR stood that is the same message we have to present to you so the priest has they stood in Jordan and all this Tri they pick Stones under their feet and he said now when you get to the other side and your children children ask you what about these Stones tell them it's a memorial this is what God did to us when we Cross Jordan it dried up and we pick the stones he said it is a memorial and God said to Joshua we want to make a memorial onto this go out there and send each Israelite one out of a tribe and pick up 12 Stones and make a memorial and this Memorial shall be that when your children are passing through this way they will ask what caused these stones to be here and ye shall give them the story of how God stay the Jordan that is a wonderful memory someday I hope to look at those stones in the near future or where they they still stand as a memorial but then I think of another Memorial what a g breed Memorial that was they had a wonderful Memorial but we are here to talk of a memorial that nothing can really compete with that Memorial that is the word of God that's right the Hebrew children is a memorial we talk about how they were put in the fire but fire could not consume them we read the Bible it's a memorial you understand David stands as a memorial like we heard about David talk about him look at this lady David he stands as a memorial why because he stood on the word of God he heard the Revelation and he believed that God's word cannot fail and that is how he destroyed that giant that everybody was sced about they were afraid of gol in the message preparation so he go the one and the staff and he goes up there to his brothers to meet his brothers out of the field and this big giant run and R he R he happened to r that day before a wrong man that's right he has been roaring but that day he Roar before a wrong man brother if you have the Holy Ghost and you are firmly established on the Lord when somebody is holding God say so don't joke with that man God said so listen he R before a wrong man that day he has got the leeway he come and mess up and go free but that day there was a man at the camp yes that's right and David said what is happening right there they say keep quiet you're a little boy said what do you mean how can I stand here and allow this uncircumcised fisan to defy the enemies of God how can you stand here and allow people to M of Christianity you a witness a testimony you have been anointed to prove that this generation God has got a witness how can you stand ID and allow somebody to destroy Christianity lost wife also stand as a memorial but it's a bad Memorial there are memorials that are bad there are memorials that are good what Memorial are you putting out there we talk about right at the barrier and the funeral lot of testimonies came for what Memorial are you building what do people talk about you this is another Memorial L wife is a memorial but is it a good Memorial he was driven God showed Grace the grace was extended to her as well but he refused to walk in the grace of God 10 over to look at those T that he left behind he stands a memorial but it's not a good Memorial Mrs La stands for a memorial and when God give her her last message of Grace when he sent those angels down there to H tell them that within a few hours that Sodom and gorra was going to be burned yet she could not stand the thought of giving up her social life he couldn't do that Judas es scariot he also stand as a memorial it's a memorial what Memorial did he put out there he so the innocent one and the prophet said in the I shall talk I shall talk to my way he said and he heard the twinkling the twinkling of the silver as it it tinkled in his hand and he cried I betrayed an innocent blood the prophet said listen now I wonder tonight as I thought of my way if many people people here and listening tonight hasn't cheated their neighbor just a little bit done a little crooked deal I pray that if that be the case that you will hear the tinling of that money that you cheated somebody it is tinkling in your hand amen it's making noise like when they were counting Judas money into his hand it was making noise right let us check let us examine our deal and what we have done that deal is tinling it is making noise in your hand may God have PR many people they will we start the race with them but because they have the love of this world than the love of God so they cannot stay they cannot proceed they cannot move further they go back to the world and many people take God Christ that way today because they come out from the world feel like they are forc to do it nobody is forcing you my sister Pastor one is not forcing you to dress good he's not forcing you not to where pains and he's not forcing you nobody is forcing you here and they keep longing and Lasting and they it isn't long till they are back you you know you know many sister you know many brothers you started the race with they are also standing as a memorial let the race let the message because they love the things of the world than the things of God it's a memorial it's a memorial Peter made also a memorial when he told Jesus I will never deny you I'll go all length with you and even where you die I will die Jesus said Peter that is wonderful but please stop that said Lord when you die I will die but he made it Memorial when they go to the time that Jesus was available many times when you are in church you can jump you can scream You Can Dance you can say Amen but when you are out of church the environment change the atmosphere change and that is where we are going to see if you can really put out Jesus out there if you can demonstrate Christ out there not the environment where the Holy Ghost is filling every place yeah praise the Lord amen that's right amen when Jesus was very close to Peter he was able to cut ear when Jesus is closer you can also cut ear because he's closer if there's any battle you are engaging Jesus to fight so that was Peter I know if the battle is set in AR Jesus is here he will fight am that's why he got here am but Jesus told him my friend this is not the battle for men if it was any battle the angels will come to fight so my friend it's not your battle that's right he pick the ear place it back Peter is not your battle the people they saw all these things but nothing sto them because God was making a memorial amen P after Jesus was taken a distance away he was left by himself and he began to be cold maybe it was Winter he begin to be cold brother let me tell you when Jesus is closer you are warm but when he's at a distance you see the cold yeah right you see that is where you need a memorial you need a Holy Ghost Fire when the Holy Ghost Fire is settl in you it will warm you every day every hour every moment every place every situation you'll be warm Peter he saw fire and he he happened to set by the fire warming himself hey Jesus was taken far distance but Jesus was watching watching his guy somebody comes around are you not the leader of the group you please no no no you are one of them let me tell you that man that beat over there I never know him I'm here as a spectator I'm also I'm here to see what Isen happening that's right they spotted him again spotted him the third time he could not change his den he contined to deny under the and Memorial said the cook is growing today the cck is growing look at the treatment you have given to Jesus is growing but look at this Memorial when they come through and then Peter knew what he has done he went to he hand he went and looked for a corner somewhere and wept bitterly my sister my brother it's time to weep because the is growing you have denied Jesus look at your attitude look at what you have done to Jesus Christ why don't you find a corner and Weep the coke is growing a memorial Memorial it was David he also made a Memoria when BBA this beautiful lady was washing he stood at the top of his Palace saw this beautiful he said go and fetch me that girl they said no no no is your seven Ora wife somebody's wife they told him it is somebody's wife your own servant a soldier wife not that they didn't tell him but David went ahead and made a memorial go and f that woman for me I'm giving you command what are you telling me they give they fed the woman and we know the story he a memorial said there are many things that is not supposed even to be written in the Bible but God permitted it to be written right there for you to know that God doesn't hide any secret yeah that's right is there but when naan went to him and rebuked him by the wisdom that he applied right there David he he torn his clothes he rent his clothes and he wept bitterly another Memorial yes Memorials of God when you are rebooked when you have been exposed what is your attitude what's your reaction many of us when we rebook we don't seem to have any remorse we don't seem to have any repentance we try to fight on we try to persist on we try to justify our evil days memorial memorial David he repented but God said Nan said although you have repented but this deed this attitude you have made room for enemies to blashe yes that is why we have to be very careful sister God will forgive you you when you repent but that attitude that behavior the community your environment people will blashe against God because of you because of your behavior because how you conduct yourself in that Community because how you talk because how you you you you you approach your husband said we have become fist actors when he was talking on the phone you see the sister oh hello oh sweet somebody talking from outside oh everything is okay but when the husband is talking to her you see how you shout the husband Hey Joe hey go and watch the place I give you command said ay you aesy an actor you must be what you are not when people are talking from outside Hallelujah and when you are talking to your husband you are the boss in the house you understand look at pet the upper room changed the atmosphere when they went to Upper Room they were there waiting for a promise brother they made a memorial they stay right there to make the Bible fulfill and when the Holy Ghost came down that fire from God happened to get into their life praise the Lord and when the fire move in brother they were Fearless Peter could not deny Jesus again brother when the Holy Ghost fill your heart you know that the upper room you are dead but you are alive because of Jesus Jesus Christ so you are fearless you don't fear death again you need to take a trip to Upper Room thank you Jesus you will not fear death P if you don't stop preaching this sermon we are going to I'm already dead I I died in Upper Room I'm already dead what death are you talking about I'm already dead for me to live now is Christ not me I am dead because of sin but I'm alive because of Christ the right of Jesus Christ Memorial now he said brother the Holy Ghost is what leads the church that is I will restore SE the Lord T number 54829 paragraph 203 the Holy Ghost is what leads the church that's right take that of the if you take that out of it and you take the life out of it it will quit it will quit growing if you take the holy ghost out of the church it will be dwar it it will quit growing it can't grow you understand that is right and when God sends the Holy Ghost down like did on the of Pentecost the M rushing wind the only thing the church does is M and grown and say there is no such a thing why can't you bend because you are dead that's exactly why she got no life in it you just stand there and the wind blows right against you and he talk about when he went to the forest and then there was a bent over and the Very trees that he visited the forest that they were dancing to the wind they were just th and they were mourning when they went there was no flexibility that is a Christian when you don't have the lubrication when you are not lubricated by the Holy Ghost oil brother you stand stiff and when the wind of God is brewing the wind that is supposed to blow all those stuff out of you you will stand down then you'll be mourning there is no life brother let us get that quickening power in it we need it back lord we need the life back we need the Holy Ghost Memorial look at this eaglers this little ones they have a comfortable Zone when Mama has put all these feathers get feathers and stuff the next for them comfortable but it will

you are under the rough sea and you have the master with you he knows how to set the sail Memorial now listen falling stones or Rolling Stones cannot make the building if you here you need a cut if you just runstone and then you are just rolling this man of God has to use the knife and cut you and shape you and put you in your place yes amen no cutting is pleasant but you have to cut you the way of a true Prophet 63 T number 0119 paragraph 116 as I said decisions all year we have so many decisions that is Stones confessions and what good is a stone without a stone meon to cut H Stone me with a sharp word of God to cut him into Son of God Son of God and daughter of God and place him in the church where he belongs rolling of stones won make the building that's right you go to cut them and shape them right you need a cutting this man is not holding the sword in vain he has to use it on you he's not killing you he's shaping you and putting in your place because all those hangings will not help you those hanging must be cut off and that is his duty hallah you give a Mason a full block you see he take his two and then he'll be breaking it oh M why are you breaking my block my friend I know my job if I don't break the block there is a space full block cannot fit there everybody has got his place so don't look at faces and say this man is a rich man this one is a beautiful this one is a good one and then you ignore that poor man he has got his place if indeed he have the Holy Ghost brother do not offend one of these little ones he has got his place it is not your beautiful face it is not your cloth it is not your money he has got his place in the days of Solomon they stopped they stop building you know the story why did they stop because there was a stone that was thrown somewhere in the bush he said it is a queer it is it has got no Beauty he said we were building but I found a stone right here it doesn't look good so I throw it away after they have come j everywhere looking for it they couldn't find it so where did you throw it right into they come and they found the stone and they brought it back to the side it fit in appropriately that is his place it was no there there was no Beauty in that stone there was no Beauty in Jesus Christ but that is the corner there the Corner Stone you understand now he said the Jews Jews they prly the Israelite said they show Jesus the temple we coming to that said now in the days of Jesus that is memorial parag 71 the Jews had buil a temple as a memorial they have built Solomon Temple maybe 40 years a memorial so they were proud to show it to Jesus Lord look at our achievement look at at what we made but Jesus told them a stone will not remain on a stone right it will all be pulled down but Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away amen what Memorial are you showing there is only one Memorial that will stand in all the test of time a memorial that will face all the challenges whatever situation that's the word of God amen amen I was recently in our cancers in Pastor a Martin convention this man is almost 91 years there was prophecy many things in the meeting it was fantastic it was good but I observe that some of my friends ministers they have been Inus by the atmosphere andas you are a preacher you go everywhere have you been seen this this this wonderful experience I said brother it's good that prophecy and all those but let me tell you there is nothing greater than the word of God that said is they not saying that you should not prophesy the reason you cannot prophesy it means you are not up to the test you are not ready you are not ready to do anything for God let me tell you frankly many of us gift is sitting in you but you are not ready to use it you have hang your coat on the wall you pin it on the wall but I told them it's good but brother it is minor the word of God even if any prophecy come that is false is the word that check the prophecy so the word is supreme yes sir that's right correct I them amen then Jesus told him it's good that you build this Temple but I'm telling you it will all be pulled down but there's only one Memorial Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away amen now in this message was talking of a bridge builder let us bring his story he said the bridge builder they want to build

the Waters of far Jordan were cut off and those stones shall be for a memorial unto your unto the children of Israel do you realize that as our brother was talking just now I went back to my notes and I was just looking at some things do you realize that uh when Elijah was about to go at the beginning of Elijah Ministry he had to build an altar of 12 Stones now remember when God gave this instruction to Joshua there were 12 Stones that were built in the River Jordan and there were 12 Stones that were built out of the River Jordan so there were two Memorial there were one that was outside and there was one that was in the middle if you go back and read the scripture rightly so Elijah came and then on my Cambell he had to rebuild the altar of the Lord and what did he do he took 12 Stones again and build an altar before he left he took uh Elisha going down they had to go across Jordan he parted the River Jordan if the water was parted then definitely Elisha saw the memorial that Joshua built praise the Lord because it was an everlasting Memorial amen and then when John the Baptist came where was he preaching By The River Jordan but this time he did not point the people to Stones he point the people to the one that the memorial was speaking [Music] about and said there is one among you that I'm not wanted to lose his shoes praise the Lord I pray that the service
