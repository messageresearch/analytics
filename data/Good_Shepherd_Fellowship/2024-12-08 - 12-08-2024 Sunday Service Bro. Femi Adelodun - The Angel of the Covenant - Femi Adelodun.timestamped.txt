[1:04:40] 23 Exodus chapter
[1:04:45] 23 from verse
[1:04:51] 20 Exodus 23 from verse 20
[1:04:56] I'll start
[1:04:59] reading behold I send an angel before
[1:05:04] thee to keep thee in the word and to
[1:05:07] bring thee in the place which I have
[1:05:10] prepared thew of him and obey his voice
[1:05:15] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[1:05:18] your transgression for my name is in him
[1:05:22] but if thou shall indeed obey his voice
[1:05:27] and do all that I speak then I will be
[1:05:31] an enemy unto thine enemies and an
[1:05:35] adversary unto thine adversaries for
[1:05:39] mine Angel shall go before thee and
[1:05:42] bring thee in unto the
[1:05:44] amorites and the etit and the parasites
[1:05:49] and the Canaanites and the evites and
[1:05:52] the jebusites and I will cut them off
[1:05:56] may the Lord add blessings to the
[1:05:57] reading of his holy word you can please
[1:06:00] be
[1:06:02] seated you are welcome to the house of
[1:06:05] the Lord this
[1:06:06] morning Bible told us that Believers
[1:06:10] will come to church but you know the
[1:06:13] devil will not want us to do that but we
[1:06:16] have more victory over Satan than you
[1:06:19] can ever imagine Satan is a defeated
[1:06:23] enemy he just trying to show us that is
[1:06:26] around but he can't do more than what
[1:06:28] God has allowed him to do and brethren
[1:06:30] we have power to cast him out and it
[1:06:33] will be so Hallelujah um I bring
[1:06:37] greetings from Lagos Nigeria from the
[1:06:41] pastor and from my family my wife and
[1:06:43] children that they all doing fine I hope
[1:06:46] you accept my greetings am Hallelujah
[1:06:50] I'm certainly happy to be in your midst
[1:06:52] this morning um I don't feel like a
[1:06:54] stranger I feel like at home Hallelujah
[1:06:57] and I know we are not strangers but we
[1:07:00] are fellow Pilgrim our destination is
[1:07:04] the same and by the special grace of God
[1:07:07] we will arrive Hallelujah because our
[1:07:10] God when he redeems he does it in two
[1:07:14] parts when he brings you out he must
[1:07:16] take you in there is no halfway job with
[1:07:20] our Lord and so a child of God can never
[1:07:22] be lost regardless of the storm no devil
[1:07:26] can pluck you out of the hand of God
[1:07:29] Amen so we are bound to arrive I want to
[1:07:33] encourage you to continue on the journey
[1:07:35] regardless of the storm and trials and
[1:07:37] Temptation they are meant to strengthen
[1:07:39] you in your journey hallelujah look at
[1:07:42] the tree when the storm rages shakes
[1:07:46] left and right what does it do it gains
[1:07:49] root downward and that's what he's doing
[1:07:52] for you don't try to strengthen you they
[1:07:54] give you the grace so have more trust in
[1:07:56] the Lord because our relationship with
[1:07:59] God Is A Love Affair and trust is very
[1:08:02] essential for love to progress so you
[1:08:05] must learn to trust God and you must
[1:08:08] learn to obey may the Lord help us so
[1:08:12] this morning we won't take too much of
[1:08:14] our time so many businesses when I don't
[1:08:16] believe too much words matter even a
[1:08:19] little word from my God will make all
[1:08:21] the difference so if it is just one or
[1:08:24] two I pray to do what he has to do
[1:08:28] Hallelujah this morning we are looking
[1:08:30] at the topic the angel of the
[1:08:33] Covenant the angel of the Covenant

[1:09:05] time it says
[1:09:07] Glory that angel of Covenant the one who
[1:09:11] was with Moses in the wilderness that
[1:09:15] one who come to Paul on the road to
[1:09:18] Damascus that same one permitted his
[1:09:21] picture to be taken with
[1:09:23] us the same one that was in the picture
[1:09:28] in the live magazine the one the other
[1:09:31] day the same word by the same God
[1:09:36] through the same channels by the same
[1:09:39] way by the same promise wherever two or
[1:09:43] three are gathered in my name I am there
[1:09:46] in their midst there he is here then he
[1:09:50] is here the angels of God are encamped
[1:09:54] about those who fear

[1:10:01] respect that word without fearing God
[1:10:04] see then here he is in air this
[1:10:09] morning with us as we worship him in the
[1:10:12] spirit so Brethren the angel of Covenant
[1:10:15] we want to talk about this morning is
[1:10:17] here with us hallelujah so we are not
[1:10:21] talking about something in history but
[1:10:23] we are talking about the present thanks

[1:10:40] to Noah you know after God has created
[1:10:43] man you know Bible told us that God
[1:10:46] repented him for doing that because the
[1:10:49] thought of man was continually evil you
[1:10:53] know and what happened what caused that
[1:10:55] because there was a mixed marriage you
[1:10:58] know that was the origin of the trouble
[1:11:00] you know children of God on one side
[1:11:02] Children Of Satan on the other side but
[1:11:05] you see when Daughters of men began to
[1:11:08] become so beautiful like we have it
[1:11:10] today you know the mo the most beautiful
[1:11:15] woman in
[1:11:16] 1960s I mean it's not even as good as
[1:11:19] somebody ordinary folk working on the
[1:11:21] street because Jesus said as it was in
[1:11:24] the days of Noah and we are seeing it
[1:11:26] exactly today Hallelujah and that tells
[1:11:29] us that our covenant becomes renewed and
[1:11:32] Alive even at this time because Bible
[1:11:35] said where sin abound grace even abound
[1:11:38] much more Hallelujah so there is no way
[1:11:42] for the enemy to overcome all the angles
[1:11:45] have been covered by God you just find
[1:11:48] yourself in the world Hallelujah so he
[1:11:52] promised Noah that God told Noah you and
[1:11:55] and his family you are going to be saved
[1:11:57] because you found favor in my sight and
[1:12:00] then from Noah another man these are
[1:12:03] things that God does on his own that's
[1:12:06] why Bible told us salvation from Earth
[1:12:08] to glory is from God so if you are saved
[1:12:12] today it is God's hand it's not because
[1:12:15] you sought God Bible told us all have
[1:12:19] seen and fall short of the glory of God
[1:12:22] but when you find favor in God God will
[1:12:24] make make sure you are saved Hallelujah
[1:12:28] and that's why you are here seated today
[1:12:30] because God made sure of
[1:12:33] that another man Abraham Genesis 15 God
[1:12:38] called him he's just an ordinary person
[1:12:41] you know he did nothing exceptional just
[1:12:44] living like everybody lived in those
[1:12:46] days and then God singled him out
[1:12:51] Hallelujah why how did God do that the
[1:12:54] prophet told us that God call is by
[1:12:57] election amen so Those whom God has
[1:13:02] predestinated he has also
[1:13:05] elected amen and once he has elected
[1:13:07] them he will predestinate them to
[1:13:09] Eternal
[1:13:11] salvation the work has already been
[1:13:13] finished from the
[1:13:15] beginning Hallelujah that's why I'm
[1:13:17] telling you that the enemy cannot alter
[1:13:19] God's
[1:13:20] plan everything the enemy does is to
[1:13:23] make God's plan to come to real
[1:13:25] it amen oh you might look at it like oh
[1:13:29] this is very discouraging oh why is it
[1:13:31] happening but let me assure you it makes
[1:13:34] you closer to the God when he did that
[1:13:37] for job his intention was to make job to
[1:13:40] curse God and die but after the trials
[1:13:44] what happened to job he got more
[1:13:47] Revelation he knew that his redeemer
[1:13:49] live it Hallelujah he also knew that
[1:13:53] death is not his end because he knew
[1:13:57] that there'll be a resurrection and
[1:13:59] there'll be a Rapture and after that God
[1:14:02] doubled his
[1:14:03] wor amen so even though the enemy
[1:14:06] thought he was making a progress he
[1:14:08] never did it was only God that made
[1:14:11] progress in the life of Job and that's
[1:14:13] what will happen in your lives those
[1:14:15] challenges they will make you closer to
[1:14:17] God they will give you better Revelation
[1:14:20] they will give you more understanding
[1:14:22] and then you can even get more from God
[1:14:25] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:14:27] God and how do you know you have faith
[1:14:30] by those trials and
[1:14:32] Temptation amen so Abraham was just an
[1:14:37] idol worshiper and God called
[1:14:39] him get the out of your Kindred and go
[1:14:43] to a land that I will show you and Bible
[1:14:46] told us Abraham he obeyed he didn't even
[1:14:50] know where God was taking him
[1:14:52] to you know there was no Des
[1:14:55] destination if he was using Google Map
[1:14:58] he couldn't use it then because for you
[1:15:00] to use that map you must specify
[1:15:04] destination God is more than Google Map
[1:15:07] Hallelujah you must trust him some of us
[1:15:10] we trust those Maps but we afraid to
[1:15:13] trust God we should trust God hallelujah
[1:15:17] when it says you are healed believe you
[1:15:19] are
[1:15:20] he when you says by my stripes you are
[1:15:23] heal say Amen to it Hallelujah because
[1:15:28] it is
[1:15:29] so he told us if anybody is sick let him
[1:15:33] come for the elders the prayer of faith
[1:15:35] will heal the sick and if there have
[1:15:37] been any sin they shall even be forgiven
[1:15:40] once we have done what God's CA us to do
[1:15:43] let's leave it to God because if we
[1:15:45] finish the
[1:15:46] work amen he gave Abraham a promise and
[1:15:52] a covenant that is going to give him a
[1:15:54] land
[1:15:55] and his children there will be so many
[1:15:58] and Bible said at that moment he even
[1:16:00] have
[1:16:01] none that was nothing and he has been
[1:16:04] married for some time maybe about 50
[1:16:06] years at that time but yet nothing but
[1:16:09] God said I'm going to give you your seed
[1:16:11] will be as innumerable as the stars of
[1:16:14] the sky and Abraham believed God and
[1:16:17] Bible said it was acced to him for
[1:16:20] righteousness as a result of that
[1:16:23] Covenant he told him
[1:16:25] your children they will sourn in a
[1:16:27] foreign land 400 years then after that I
[1:16:31] will bring them out with a mighty hand
[1:16:35] even though Abraham will have gone on
[1:16:38] his own yet God is ever faithful to his
[1:16:41] Covenant if God has given you a promise
[1:16:44] Brethren be assured God will keep
[1:16:47] it regardless of what you
[1:16:50] do Hallelujah and then on down when he
[1:16:54] came to time where we are read God
[1:16:57] realized the time is here and then God
[1:17:00] Called Moses we know the C of the call
[1:17:03] of Moses I believe Exodus 3 after God
[1:17:07] called him he moved into action and then
[1:17:10] he did all the 10 plages and all those
[1:17:13] miracles signs and wonders until those
[1:17:15] children they were able to come out of
[1:17:17] that foreign land but upon all those you
[1:17:21] know miracles signs you know and wonders
[1:17:24] because
[1:17:26] I mean because of the veil of Flesh we
[1:17:29] are always you know allowing this flesh
[1:17:31] to come in between us and our
[1:17:33] relationship with God don't forget when
[1:17:36] God created man there was no flesh there
[1:17:40] before you know Genesis God created man
[1:17:44] the sixth day and there was no man to
[1:17:47] till the
[1:17:48] ground it was in Genesis I think 2:7
[1:17:52] that God created the physical man that
[1:17:54] we are see
[1:17:55] today and that physical man we call him
[1:17:59] the small boy because in the creation of
[1:18:02] things it was created
[1:18:04] last but you see he's always trying to
[1:18:07] become the
[1:18:09] boss you know and if you allow a baby to
[1:18:12] be your boss it will mislead you that's
[1:18:16] why we don't succumb to the power of
[1:18:18] Flesh Hallelujah we have to put it under
[1:18:22] subjection because he will not let don't
[1:18:25] see
[1:18:26] God the flesh is not your
[1:18:30] friend the prophet told us that the
[1:18:32] enemy of William Braham is William
[1:18:35] Braham and the same applies to all of us
[1:18:38] as long as we ELD to the flesh we cannot
[1:18:41] be in the
[1:18:42] spirit so it is honors on us to put the
[1:18:45] flesh constantly under subjection we
[1:18:48] must direct the small boy Hallelujah if
[1:18:52] you let the small boy direct you it will
[1:18:54] misdirect
[1:18:55] dtive because he's just young he doesn't
[1:18:58] know much Bible told us he only
[1:19:02] caral it belongs to the dust and that's
[1:19:06] why we know that the flesh will not go
[1:19:08] in Rapture when that moment come if you
[1:19:12] life you will be changed that's the
[1:19:14] promise we are given Hallelujah nobody
[1:19:17] is taking this body across the sky
[1:19:20] because it doesn't belong there it
[1:19:23] belongs here hey amen so Brethren when
[1:19:26] you know it belongs here and your
[1:19:28] journey is eternal you have Revelation
[1:19:31] you know how to treat it praise the
[1:19:34] Lord and so we are talking quickly about
[1:19:38] how God he called the children of Israel
[1:19:40] out of that Egypt and then they allowed
[1:19:43] the veil of Flesh to always come between
[1:19:46] them and their relationship with God you
[1:19:49] know when Moses the first experience
[1:19:52] they were theing of course it was a
[1:19:54] terrible situation you know they got to
[1:19:56] the brink of the rest sea there was no
[1:19:59] way to go looking back the enemy was
[1:20:02] coming left and right desert yes it
[1:20:05] could be very traumatic for anybody but
[1:20:08] God has always been with them
[1:20:12] Hallelujah no wonder Phillip I believe
[1:20:16] no no it was Steven in act seven he was
[1:20:20] when he was preaching he said who has
[1:20:23] received the Commandment of God by the
[1:20:25] disposition of angels and have not kept
[1:20:28] it you know because it was like God came
[1:20:31] down physically to this people to show
[1:20:33] them his way but what did they do
[1:20:37] majority of them only two enter the
[1:20:40] promised
[1:20:41] land are we
[1:20:43] together Joshua and Caleb every other
[1:20:47] person at that time they perished only
[1:20:50] their young ones made it there because
[1:20:52] of lack of faith
[1:20:55] amen and without faith it is impossible
[1:20:59] to please God all the blessings we have
[1:21:01] been enumerating and the ones we are
[1:21:03] going to talk about you can only obtain
[1:21:06] them through the hand of
[1:21:09] Faith that's the way God arranged it and
[1:21:12] that is the only way it will
[1:21:13] be amen so we saw they went through that
[1:21:18] and then it got to a time God said I
[1:21:22] will no longer go with you because if I
[1:21:25] go with you I'm going to destroy you
[1:21:28] because they constantly lusting after
[1:21:31] worldly things you know despite all the
[1:21:34] Miracles all the signs all the Wonders
[1:21:38] everything God has done even to their
[1:21:40] enemies still at the slightest
[1:21:43] opportunity let's go back to
[1:21:45] Egypt oh we are missing the onions and
[1:21:48] the garlics and the cucumber and the
[1:21:50] rest of them you know they don't want
[1:21:53] the glory of God just for those
[1:21:55] temporary things all because they are
[1:21:58] yielding to the
[1:21:59] flesh they cannot look beyond their
[1:22:03] sight
[1:22:04] Hallelujah and then in where we have
[1:22:07] read God now said what Moses cist said
[1:22:10] God you cannot leave us without you we
[1:22:13] have nothing so God said okay what I
[1:22:16] will do I will send my angel before you
[1:22:20] because physically my presence you know
[1:22:23] one time they told Moses
[1:22:25] it's not only you that know God we want
[1:22:27] to see God himself let God talk to us
[1:22:31] you I think I have a quote I hope time
[1:22:33] will tell me will allow me the prophet
[1:22:35] said God has always used the agency of
[1:22:39] man God don't use mechanical device
[1:22:42] maybe we should read
[1:22:44] it God in his people 1
[1:22:49] 15227 God in his people paragraph
[1:22:53] 23 can I read them no okay okay there he
[1:22:58] said God doesn't fall upon
[1:23:03] denominations God doesn't fall upon
[1:23:05] Mechanical
[1:23:07] Devices God the Holy Spirit fell upon
[1:23:10] men man is God's agent and the hardest
[1:23:15] thing that God has ever had to do was to
[1:23:18] get one m to believe another are we
[1:23:22] together very difficult do you believe
[1:23:25] that they couldn't believe Moses and God
[1:23:29] gave him two signs to prove to the
[1:23:32] people that he was sent from God for
[1:23:35] their
[1:23:36] Deliverance you believe that well isn't
[1:23:40] it the same yesterday today and forever
[1:23:44] do you believe the angel that talked to
[1:23:46] him in the in the burning bush is the
[1:23:49] Angel of the
[1:23:50] Covenant was that right all right is the
[1:23:54] same yesterday today and forever he's
[1:23:57] here now and he does the same things
[1:24:00] today that he did then yes and he still
[1:24:04] performs wonders and signs he is a
[1:24:07] miraculous God if you are trusting God
[1:24:10] for a miracle now God is here to do that
[1:24:13] you have to believe amen and he always
[1:24:16] works in a miraculous ways with signs
[1:24:20] and wonders so those things are not gone
[1:24:23] they are present believe God for
[1:24:27] yours he Pro and he promised them in
[1:24:30] these last days and we are living in the
[1:24:33] last days we got a right to expect them
[1:24:37] now so if you're in expectation you are
[1:24:40] right it will be
[1:24:42] met that's right to bring his people
[1:24:45] together so God has always used the
[1:24:48] agency of man not mechanical device to
[1:24:52] talk to people he only anoint man men
[1:24:56] upon men and he say he gave gift unto
[1:24:58] men some Apostles and the rest of them
[1:25:01] you know them so that they can do what
[1:25:03] they can speak for
[1:25:05] God those times those say we want to
[1:25:08] hear God directly it's not only Moses we
[1:25:10] are all holy and okay God said no
[1:25:14] problem prepare yourself three days this
[1:25:17] mountain God is going to come down let
[1:25:20] nobody touch it so they say we are ready
[1:25:23] we are all children of God Hallelujah of
[1:25:25] course we are all God's children but God
[1:25:28] places us
[1:25:30] positionally we have we are like the
[1:25:32] body every the leg cannot do the work of
[1:25:35] the hand I'm telling you if you try that
[1:25:37] you become something else you become a
[1:25:39] stranger man that people will run from
[1:25:42] but let's put things in their position
[1:25:45] and everything will work
[1:25:47] right so they said God speak to all of
[1:25:50] us God said okay I will do it and then
[1:25:52] in three days they were ready and before
[1:25:55] God could come down maybe God was just
[1:25:57] shining his shoe or something and then
[1:26:00] the old mountain was Smoky everywhere
[1:26:02] was thundering and then said they run we
[1:26:05] don't want to hear God again Hallelujah
[1:26:08] let Moses speak is enough and God said
[1:26:12] from that moment I'll do that
[1:26:15] Hallelujah so when you see a Vindicated
[1:26:18] man of God which you already got today
[1:26:21] he has the signs he has the Wonders he
[1:26:24] has a Vindication everything's in line
[1:26:25] with the one what will a Believer do we
[1:26:29] believe and then we will do what we see
[1:26:31] the glory of God hallelujah and so from
[1:26:35] that where we God now said now I'm going
[1:26:37] to send an angel before you we can read
[1:26:40] that when you get home he promised them
[1:26:42] many things I will cut off your enemies
[1:26:45] your children they will not cast their
[1:26:47] young you know so many promises but
[1:26:49] there is a
[1:26:51] condition you know you must stay in the
[1:26:53] land
[1:26:55] and that is in the word of God God told
[1:26:57] them if you obey my voice that's what
[1:27:00] God is still saying today we cannot say
[1:27:03] we are believers the prophet said if you
[1:27:06] say you believe and you don't do the
[1:27:08] word of God then you are not a
[1:27:10] Believer we must believe and act that is
[1:27:14] the meaning of being a Believer you know
[1:27:17] our lives the word of God that we are
[1:27:20] reing reading living by every day must
[1:27:23] reflect in our Liv lives so that when
[1:27:25] people see us they will glorify our
[1:27:27] Heavenly Father in
[1:27:29] Heaven Hallelujah and so all these
[1:27:33] things started the has always them
[1:27:35] represented by Pillar of Fire in the
[1:27:37] night and pillar of cloud in the day you
[1:27:40] know they are seeing those two signs
[1:27:42] today like the prophet said we have them
[1:27:45] photographed because we in the Third
[1:27:48] Exodus I believe we all know that and
[1:27:50] those things that happen then they will
[1:27:52] happen today we have James and jambers
[1:27:55] we will have K and the rest of them but
[1:27:58] yeah we still going to have Moses that
[1:28:00] will be Joshua that will be Caleb so it
[1:28:03] depends on the camp you belong and that
[1:28:05] will give you the blessings of the hour
[1:28:08] because Brethren the blessings are
[1:28:11] promised you know it's not we are
[1:28:13] serving God yes not because of what we
[1:28:16] can get but because we love him but
[1:28:19] there is something to get to praise the
[1:28:22] Lord when people
[1:28:24] ask him Master where we have left all
[1:28:28] what shall be our gain you know when
[1:28:30] that Rich Young Ruler when Christ loved
[1:28:33] him oh you have done everything saying
[1:28:35] he has kept the love from his Youth and
[1:28:37] all that and God say only one thing left
[1:28:40] all that you have said give to the poor
[1:28:43] and follow me because Christ knew that
[1:28:46] the wealth was his God and if you want
[1:28:49] to serve God you only serve him
[1:28:51] alone nothing must be between you and
[1:28:54] the Savior Hallelujah you must not put
[1:28:58] anything ahead of God because if you do
[1:29:01] that thing becomes your
[1:29:03] God and we see this man he cannot leave
[1:29:06] that mmon you know so he left
[1:29:09] sorrowfully and Peter said we we have
[1:29:12] left off some people think oh Peter he
[1:29:16] was a poor man you know Bible told us
[1:29:19] Peter was
[1:29:20] ignorant but Peter he didn't tell us
[1:29:22] Peter was poor
[1:29:24] because one time when we went to
[1:29:26] Jerusalem we saw where Peter lived you
[1:29:29] know and they told us it was in capam or
[1:29:31] somewhere where rich people live because
[1:29:34] the houses were built with some white
[1:29:36] stone and all that and that's why Peter
[1:29:38] could tell Christ who we have left all
[1:29:41] and Christ didn't say what did you leave
[1:29:43] are you not a poor man Christ agreed
[1:29:46] with him that he left and Christ say
[1:29:48] whoever have left all mother father
[1:29:51] whatever you have left you will get them
[1:29:53] in a 100 F
[1:29:55] here so there's a blessings here you
[1:29:58] know all the blessings we are talking
[1:30:00] about healing Miracles provision we
[1:30:04] don't need them in heaven it is here we
[1:30:07] need them so I encourage you increase
[1:30:10] your faith you need them here so that
[1:30:12] you don't live an underprivileged lives
[1:30:15] these things are available if it to are
[1:30:18] not so Christ will have told us but he
[1:30:21] said ask and it shall be given seek and
[1:30:25] you shall find because I'm here with you
[1:30:29] that's right Hallelujah he never left at
[1:30:32] any point in time the prophet even said
[1:30:35] sometimes when you grip the Holy Ghost
[1:30:37] is not far gone he just
[1:30:40] there because it's assigned to you it's
[1:30:44] for you
[1:30:46] Hallelujah Brethren let's exercise our
[1:30:49] faith praise the Lord you know when the
[1:30:52] Devil Comes Around The Devil is is a
[1:30:54] loser already let me assure you that he
[1:30:57] is a
[1:30:58] loser he has no the only role is here to
[1:31:02] play is to chase us to our Salvation
[1:31:05] everything he does makes us love God
[1:31:08] more Hallelujah so he's a frustrated
[1:31:13] fellow but he cannot be saved so we have
[1:31:17] no business with him he is an eternal
[1:31:20] enemy there is no compromise Hallelujah
[1:31:24] because some people maybe brother call
[1:31:25] them Universalist they believe that
[1:31:28] Satan will be saved and Satan can never
[1:31:30] be saved he can never
[1:31:33] repent if the sin is started in heaven
[1:31:36] will consume him eventually that's the
[1:31:39] way it is there's no solution because we
[1:31:41] have seen his end already and that's not
[1:31:44] going to change so for us we must keep
[1:31:47] matching on we should not give a thought
[1:31:50] to him don't let sympathize with him is
[1:31:54] an enemy
[1:31:56] Hallelujah so this our Brethren that
[1:31:58] we're talking about you know so at that
[1:32:01] time they decided oh God don't speak to
[1:32:04] us again use that man or any other man
[1:32:08] and then God promised them his Angel it
[1:32:10] will go with them and then we saw what
[1:32:12] the angel did with them you know through
[1:32:15] the Wilderness even though they didn't
[1:32:17] make their request know correctly
[1:32:19] sometimes when they wanted meat all they
[1:32:22] have to do is ask but what were they
[1:32:24] doing they were murmuring grumbling
[1:32:28] crying until Moses himself got fed
[1:32:31] up you know Moses went back to God and
[1:32:34] said oh God why did you hate me so much
[1:32:38] and you put all the burdens of these
[1:32:41] people like two million upon only me he
[1:32:44] said am I de father he said God kill me
[1:32:48] now go said what is the problem said
[1:32:51] they wanted meat what are I we going to
[1:32:54] provide meat for all of them and going
[1:32:57] Say by tomorrow tell them ah I'm going
[1:33:01] to give them meat God is still in the
[1:33:04] business of
[1:33:05] provision he is the same yesterday today
[1:33:08] and
[1:33:10] forever he said I will not just provide
[1:33:13] for tomorrow I'm going to provide for
[1:33:15] one month and M went back to go and said
[1:33:19] it appears you don't know what you are
[1:33:21] saying we have at least 600 foot men
[1:33:25] here what are we going to get meat for
[1:33:28] them and God told Moses who do you think
[1:33:31] we are talking
[1:33:33] to sometimes you don't know the God we
[1:33:35] are praying
[1:33:36] to oh we use our little imagination to
[1:33:41] make provisions and solutions God is way
[1:33:44] above that let me tell you he makes way
[1:33:46] where there are no
[1:33:48] ways he resolves issue there has been a
[1:33:51] testimony I think it happened in Ghana
[1:33:53] if I can recall a baby was born with um
[1:33:58] maybe without one limb the scan showed
[1:34:01] it and then Brethren prayed and this by
[1:34:05] the time the baby they went for the scan
[1:34:07] again the everything was perfect the
[1:34:10] baby we saw the the scan we saw when the
[1:34:12] baby was born and then the baby grew God
[1:34:15] is still in that business if you can
[1:34:18] believe then you will see the glory of
[1:34:20] God
[1:34:22] hallelujah and Moses told God this is
[1:34:25] practically not possible why are we
[1:34:28] going to make false promise to them we
[1:34:30] are no politicians God said go and tell
[1:34:33] them I'm going to do it do you think my
[1:34:36] hands are shut and God Did It by the
[1:34:39] next day Bible said qus as high as this
[1:34:43] on the ground Miles and
[1:34:46] Miles they head until they see you know
[1:34:49] you can eat meat until when you see meat
[1:34:51] you run they got to that stage because
[1:34:55] God no there's nothing possible before
[1:34:58] him and he promis us don't forget he's
[1:35:01] always in the midst of his people that's
[1:35:03] why we must keep our skates clean
[1:35:06] because the God is the only God if we
[1:35:08] want God to move in our lives in our
[1:35:10] homes we must create the
[1:35:13] atmosphere Hallelujah because God
[1:35:16] doesn't
[1:35:17] Force he has given all the instructions
[1:35:20] it is own us on us to obey them and when
[1:35:24] we obey them we will see the good of the
[1:35:26] land that's how he promised it and then
[1:35:30] through the period after he got them
[1:35:32] through to the promised land we saw that
[1:35:35] that angel of Covenant was still with
[1:35:37] them fighting battles for them we saw
[1:35:39] when they they wanted to cross I mean
[1:35:42] the the Jericho wall you know at that
[1:35:46] time that wall also can run a breast on
[1:35:48] it there was no way to bring that thing
[1:35:52] down
[1:35:54] but with God nothing shall be impossible
[1:35:57] the prophet heav with
[1:35:59] you if only you can
[1:36:02] believe Hallelujah and God gave the
[1:36:05] winning formula and we saw that Jero was
[1:36:08] fa and so every battle over time because
[1:36:12] God was keeping his Covenant that he
[1:36:13] made to their father Abraham even when
[1:36:16] Abraham was no longer there how much
[1:36:19] more what is making to you today
[1:36:24] Hallelujah and we saw let me
[1:36:30] read the seed shall not be here with the
[1:36:36] shock paragraph
[1:36:39] 32 Christ is that angel today he said
[1:36:43] like in the beginning God God dwelt
[1:36:47] alone because he was the Eternal one see
[1:36:52] wasn't even God in the the beginning God
[1:36:55] is an object of worship and the logos as
[1:36:59] we call it and the word that went out of
[1:37:02] God that anyone knows that that was the
[1:37:06] angel of the Lord or the word of the
[1:37:09] Lord that followed the Israelites
[1:37:11] through the Wilderness and the angel of
[1:37:13] the Covenant the logos that went out of
[1:37:17] God and then that logos was made flesh
[1:37:22] and dwelt Among Us us now we are in we
[1:37:26] are in St John 1 in the beginning was
[1:37:30] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:37:33] the Word was God and now as he gave his
[1:37:37] life for us then his Spirit come back
[1:37:41] upon us Jesus said at that day you know
[1:37:46] that I am in the father and the father
[1:37:48] in me and I in you and you in me see
[1:37:53] it's God all
[1:37:55] along God manifesting himself working
[1:37:59] himself through different ages so those
[1:38:03] three of Father Son and Holy Spirit same
[1:38:07] God working in three attributes and we
[1:38:10] today are one the church itself an
[1:38:14] attribute of God's thinking before the
[1:38:17] foundation of the world to have a church
[1:38:20] so those which are in Christ was in
[1:38:23] Christ at the beginning and that was his
[1:38:26] thought his thought is his attribute
[1:38:29] today after so many times then we got to
[1:38:33] the second Exodus that was a religion
[1:38:38] Christ leading the church out of a
[1:38:40] religion initially the first Exodus a
[1:38:43] nation out of another nation and Christ
[1:38:47] it was the fullness of godhead body so
[1:38:51] at that time you can't see pill of fire
[1:38:53] or anything because everything was
[1:38:54] Christ he told them before Abraham was I
[1:39:00] am they say who are you you are not even
[1:39:03] 50 years have you seen our Father
[1:39:05] Abraham said before even Abraham I am
[1:39:09] and you know what he told Moses when
[1:39:11] Moses said what is your name he said I
[1:39:14] am that I am Hallelujah and when Jesus
[1:39:18] answered he didn't say I was he said
[1:39:21] before then I am is always the I am the
[1:39:25] everpresent water from The Rock he is
[1:39:29] never is gone even in that situation is
[1:39:32] there present with you Hallelujah so
[1:39:36] Christ became the angel of Covenant in
[1:39:38] the New Testament and we saw the things
[1:39:41] he did
[1:39:43] Hallelujah there was no trouble that
[1:39:46] came in contact with Christ that wasn't
[1:39:49] soed he raised the dead right four days
[1:39:54] dead
[1:39:55] Lazarus you know magos and everything
[1:39:58] but that couldn't stand in the way of
[1:40:00] God I don't know your circumstance this
[1:40:03] morning or afternoon but they can't
[1:40:05] stand in the way of God the Devil May
[1:40:08] kind of magnify them to you but it can't
[1:40:11] stand before God hallelujah you just
[1:40:15] have to look through and believe that
[1:40:19] this my situation is not above my God
[1:40:22] after all don't see how big your problem
[1:40:25] is but see how big your God is and our
[1:40:29] god is so big if you don't know look at
[1:40:33] the Solar System look at the universe
[1:40:36] look at those Micky way androm media
[1:40:40] they are massive anything you see there
[1:40:42] they are millions of years away so when
[1:40:46] you see a St there probably you are seen
[1:40:49] 70 million years
[1:40:51] ago and that's God and see nothing
[1:40:54] before God that's how big our God is so
[1:40:57] how big can this your problem be that
[1:40:59] can be bigger than God it's not possible
[1:41:03] you just have to exercise the
[1:41:06] faith amen if you look at there was a
[1:41:10] time in
[1:41:11] Ezekiel what happened there God took
[1:41:14] Ezekiel to a valley and in that Valley
[1:41:17] the is full of dry
[1:41:20] bones bones that are completely dry you
[1:41:23] don't even know who died that the bone
[1:41:26] turned to that one it was a completely
[1:41:28] hopeless situation but God told ask
[1:41:32] Ezekiel can this bones rise Ezekiel I
[1:41:36] don't know because this is beyond
[1:41:38] imagination how can dry bones rise God
[1:41:42] said they will rise prophesy to them
[1:41:45] prophecy is the word of the Lord which
[1:41:48] you are even hearing today
[1:41:50] Hallelujah and he prophesy and Bible
[1:41:53] said there was a
[1:41:55] noise a shaking coming together s flesh
[1:42:01] upon flesh and then he said God said
[1:42:05] again the work is not done prophesy that
[1:42:08] the breath from the four corners of the
[1:42:10] earth coming to them and that happened
[1:42:13] and they became a mighty Army
[1:42:16] Hallelujah I don't think your situation
[1:42:19] can be that
[1:42:20] bad so whatever your situation this
[1:42:23] morning I'm here to announce to you that
[1:42:25] God is ready to solve it Hallelujah you
[1:42:30] just have to hold
[1:42:31] on you know the prophet told us in the
[1:42:34] sermon beting of God he said when you
[1:42:36] have done everything you should do like
[1:42:39] job did he sacrificed for the children
[1:42:42] made sure everything was correct yet the
[1:42:45] devil struck he said that time hold
[1:42:48] on that is the time to be certain of God
[1:42:52] because God is just
[1:42:54] waiting he has already solved the
[1:42:56] problem but he's just waiting Brethren
[1:42:59] don't give up hold on oh don't say oh

[1:43:08] your house and he has not forgotten you
[1:43:11] you are going to testify you are going
[1:43:14] to glorify his name Brethren hold on to
[1:43:17] Christ
[1:43:18] Hallelujah that's why because he wants
[1:43:21] to do more than we can even imagine
[1:43:23] amen but we limit God the prophet told
[1:43:27] us that God's great blessing is like a
[1:43:30] big store sometimes they in the next
[1:43:32] floor all you have to do is to reach to
[1:43:35] that ladder of

[1:48:54] Hallelujah he moved you know from
[1:48:58] beginning when he was not even God you
[1:49:02] know because God is an object of worship
[1:49:05] then he came he became a Loos and then
[1:49:08] on down Through the Ages he was showing
[1:49:10] himself in different Manner and then
[1:49:13] Christ came he said body has now
[1:49:15] prepared for me and then the same Christ

[1:49:46] the Eastern adoption we are in a child
[1:49:49] born in a home going through tooth Ag
[1:49:52] and once the child become matured and
[1:49:55] recommended by the tutor then he can do
[1:49:58] what the father can do he can act on
[1:50:01] behalf of the father it happened to
[1:50:04] Christ and we are little Christ on Mount
[1:50:08] Transfiguration he went there and a
[1:50:10] voice spoke this is my beloved Son in
[1:50:14] whom I am well pleased hear ye
[1:50:19] him

[1:50:42] there must be growth and when growth
[1:50:45] occur we must become adopted then we get
[1:50:48] to the age of the spoken word which we
[1:50:50] are around now you know when God will do
[1:50:53] a short squeak work so that you can say
[1:50:57] oh there's dry land here you need rain I

[1:51:23] these words are coming and don't forget
[1:51:26] he said they'll be falling away
[1:51:28] first that's why you see some of those
[1:51:31] things you are

[1:51:35] heart be troubled oh you see is there

[1:51:56] doesn't matter how long was Judas there

[1:52:03] that of Peter and yet he has his purpose
[1:52:08] oh may the Lord help us that our purpose
[1:52:10] should be to the glory of God because
[1:52:13] God it can never lose and if Christ is
[1:52:15] in you you can never lose the prophet
[1:52:18] said Christians don't lose head or ta
[1:52:21] you can't lose
[1:52:23] if the devil come disturb you God will
[1:52:26] take you he can't have you because the
[1:52:31] title did it cannot it's just an
[1:52:34] occupier you know there's something
[1:52:36] called owner occupier in building then
[1:52:40] there's also tenants there are SCS right
[1:52:44] they just take over you know but they
[1:52:46] don't have any title that's Satan for
[1:52:49] you it's just rush everybody because of
[1:52:52] the nature he Rush it's always rushing
[1:52:56] but first come it's not always the
[1:52:58] owner because the owner knows himself
[1:53:01] there's no rush when your time come God
[1:53:04] will show himself to you no matter how
[1:53:07] long gone you are when you hear that
[1:53:10] voice you will return
[1:53:13] hallelujah oh praise the Lord don't
[1:53:16] forget that eagle that was found in The
[1:53:20] Bard you know he was behaving like
[1:53:23] chicken but I couldn't do it well
[1:53:26] because from the beginning it wasn't a
[1:53:29] chicken and so I I know the mama chicken
[1:53:32] will be wondering what kind of strange
[1:53:34] stuff is this but anyway mother's
[1:53:37] instinct he has to take care of him but
[1:53:39] one day the real mother was
[1:53:42] flying oh Hallelujah and that was the
[1:53:46] day you came to Christ you have always
[1:53:49] been
[1:53:50] elected but your realiz ization came
[1:53:53] when you had that voice a when that
[1:53:56] small iglet had the voice all the other
[1:54:00] chicken R for
[1:54:01] cover but he was still there saying this
[1:54:04] look
[1:54:05] familiar oh Hallelujah that's why when
[1:54:08] you heard this message everybody say oh
[1:54:10] it's a CT it's he said no no no but this
[1:54:13] thing makes sense it's right there in
[1:54:15] the Bible I mean because he familiar to
[1:54:19] you because it's coming from your home
[1:54:23] Hallelujah just like as I am here now if
[1:54:26] somebody speaks yba anywhere I can hear
[1:54:30] there's no way I be I would kind of long
[1:54:33] to what what am I hearing and that's the
[1:54:36] way that igler was when she had it even
[1:54:40] though the others are running away but
[1:54:42] this things seems so normal Hallelujah
[1:54:46] and that boy said jump off said no I've
[1:54:49] never jump off my life that's many what
[1:54:52] all many of us say oh I've never tried
[1:54:55] it
[1:54:56] before but you are in
[1:54:58] him the pr say we are his
[1:55:02] attribute it seems you have never tried
[1:55:05] it before but you are part of the
[1:55:08] system Just Launch out you will realize
[1:55:11] it's normal
[1:55:13] Hallelujah having faith in God is normal
[1:55:16] receiving Miracles is noral signs and
[1:55:19] wonders Bible said to follow us we are
[1:55:22] not seeking for signs and wonders oh
[1:55:24] they are doing miracle there that's not
[1:55:26] our business we are following the world
[1:55:28] then the signs will follow us they must
[1:55:31] that's what the word says and that one
[1:55:35] day he tried it the mother said just a
[1:55:38] little flap you will be up there
[1:55:41] Brethren a little fith oh breath a
[1:55:45] prayer of faith when you face those
[1:55:48] storing situation they are not to
[1:55:50] destroy you that's not the
[1:55:53] purpose you are the bride of Christ and
[1:55:56] no man will allow his bride to
[1:56:00] suffer it doesn't
[1:56:03] happen of course that could be abnormal
[1:56:06] situation but not with God hallelujah he
[1:56:10] told us we his bride even the bride will
[1:56:12] not go through
[1:56:13] tribulation all those trials and stuff
[1:56:17] just to make you better to put you in a
[1:56:20] position to receive more blessings from
[1:56:23] God what is God doing with those
[1:56:25] blessings what is he doing with the Holy
[1:56:27] Ghost it's for you and me so it's God to
[1:56:30] put you in shape to receive them
[1:56:33] Hallelujah that's why all these things
[1:56:35] happen because God have these things in
[1:56:38] store you know it's not for storage it's
[1:56:41] for our
[1:56:43] use let's stretch the hand of Faith
[1:56:46] Breen oh don't say oh my needs are small
[1:56:49] ask God oh they are too big ask God
[1:56:53] because he's there to answer them
[1:56:56] Hallelujah and then we saw what Christ
[1:56:58] did all through his own time you know we
[1:57:01] said all problem that came to Christ
[1:57:05] they got solved Hallelujah they go when
[1:57:08] they reached Christ that was the end
[1:57:12] regardless of how complex or
[1:57:14] unimaginable they were and he told us he
[1:57:17] has given us the same
[1:57:18] power Hallelujah and we saw Men Who are
[1:57:22] filled with the Holy Ghost they exercise
[1:57:24] that
[1:57:25] power that was the time Peter I think
[1:57:28] and John they went to the temple and
[1:57:31] there was a there a known
[1:57:33] he has always been there and
[1:57:36] Bible say looked at them expecting
[1:57:38] something you know that's his man wasn't
[1:57:42] expecting
[1:57:43] Miracle because probably he has given up
[1:57:45] or he has not seen somebody healed
[1:57:47] before but said oh look on us
[1:57:52] silver and gold we don't have but we got
[1:57:55] something brethren we have something oh
[1:57:59] you have more than gold in your hand you
[1:58:02] just don't know oh may the Lord help us
[1:58:05] give us Revelation to know who you are
[1:58:08] you know the prophet told us I think in
[1:58:10] the exposition of the seven churches he
[1:58:13] said if the Church of God can know which
[1:58:16] she is and that she's ordained to do the
[1:58:19] Greater Works he say she will become an
[1:58:21] inv vincible Army Hallelujah this
[1:58:25] morning know yourself Hallelujah and
[1:58:29] then look on US silver and gold we don't
[1:58:32] have but such as we have we will give
[1:58:35] you in the name of Jesus rise up and
[1:58:37] walk and Bible said they helped him up
[1:58:40] and then he was limping and jumping
[1:58:43] because Christ already in them that
[1:58:46] angel of Covenant tabernacled in them
[1:58:50] and they were doing even prison
[1:58:52] couldn't hold them are we together
[1:58:56] nothing can stop somebody who has Christ
[1:58:58] in himself oh you can say but there are
[1:59:01] so many sicknesses in the world if we
[1:59:03] are that powerful why can't we heal
[1:59:06] them you must have faith to
[1:59:09] receive that is the principle of
[1:59:12] receiving it's not just even though
[1:59:15] sometimes your faith can be enough to
[1:59:17] extend to somebody else but God said Let
[1:59:19] It Be unto you according to your faith
[1:59:22] that's the principle so this morning or
[1:59:25] afternoon increase your faith so that
[1:59:28] you can receive more from this angel of
[1:59:30] Covenant because he's here with us he
[1:59:34] even told us where two or three are
[1:59:35] gathered in his name right there in
[1:59:37] their mid it will be not just to record
[1:59:40] our actions but to perform the Miracles
[1:59:43] is known by if God can give the word it
[1:59:47] can also give the
[1:59:49] healing if God gives you salvation it
[1:59:52] can give you a life
[1:59:54] partner if he gives you a life partner
[1:59:56] he can give you fruit of the womb it can
[1:59:59] give you good job he told us that if any
[2:00:02] man does not work he should not eat all
[2:00:06] you have to do is to remind him his
[2:00:08] promise I'm ready to walk give me the
[2:00:11] right one and he in that business
[2:00:15] Hallelujah I don't I don't want to run
[2:00:17] beyond my note I have a testimony here
[2:00:21] you know what I would just say the
[2:00:24] prophet told us that to show that the
[2:00:26] angel of Covenant was with us he talked
[2:00:28] about a man whose son caught a disease
[2:00:32] you know and then everything is pointing
[2:00:34] to death including the cardiogram and
[2:00:38] everything and so the brother said oh if
[2:00:41] the prophet can just come and pray I
[2:00:44] believe God will do something this
[2:00:46] afternoon what do you
[2:00:48] believe do you believe that if you can
[2:00:50] ask God anything this afternoon God will
[2:00:53] do it then it will be so amen and so the
[2:00:59] prophet go there you know the situation
[2:01:01] was scary the child was sorry everything
[2:01:05] the the reading was going down and going
[2:01:07] down and then they prayed the prophet
[2:01:10] prayed that's all a simple word of
[2:01:13] prayer and in faith and then the parent
[2:01:16] were jubilating God has done it God has
[2:01:19] done it you know that's the expression
[2:01:22] of Faith you know the prophet told us
[2:01:25] that what people see is a
[2:01:29] work work is the faith expressed but
[2:01:32] what God sees is the faith so if people
[2:01:35] are seeing work God is seeing faith is
[2:01:37] the two side of the same coin you are
[2:01:41] going to show your work to demonstrate
[2:01:43] that you have faith yes this couple they
[2:01:46] were already thanking God God you have
[2:01:49] he him Hallelujah and they were happy
[2:01:53] and the nurse nurse asked to call them
[2:01:56] Papa Mama sit down it appears you don't
[2:01:59] have the full understanding of what is
[2:02:03] happening and she explained to them that
[2:02:05] once the cogram get to so so so level is
[2:02:09] as good as
[2:02:11] dead they say oh thank you we appreciate
[2:02:14] this is your training that's what you
[2:02:16] are trained to read but we we are
[2:02:18] trained to look with the eyes of Faith
[2:02:21] Hallelujah
[2:02:23] prophet testified that that child was
[2:02:25] ill and he has even gotten married so I
[2:02:28] don't know how terrible your situation
[2:02:31] be or somebody you know maybe sick or
[2:02:35] anything they shall be healed Hallelujah
[2:02:38] you can stand in the gap for them they
[2:02:41] don't even have to be here I have a
[2:02:43] testimony to there was a time one of our
[2:02:46] uncle he lives in the US here they sent
[2:02:49] us a message he C he wanted to go to the
[2:02:52] toilet or the bathroom then he collapsed
[2:02:55] on the way it was bleeding everything
[2:02:58] they don't even know what to do the
[2:03:00] first call they made to us he said this
[2:03:02] is situation pray Brethren that person
[2:03:06] is still alive today since serving the
[2:03:09] lord we prayed in the morning when the
[2:03:11] day broke they took him to the hospital
[2:03:13] by the in short before the noon of that
[2:03:17] day was back in his house doing what he
[2:03:19] has to do because God such prayer
[2:03:23] distance is not a barrier all you need
[2:03:25] is Faith Hallelujah we are talking about
[2:03:29] the angel of Covenant that was with them
[2:03:32] in the wilderness who became Christ and
[2:03:35] the Holy Ghost in you today Hallelujah
[2:03:39] and we are saying what he did then he
[2:03:41] can do even
[2:03:42] today and there is no
[2:03:45] limitation the only limitation that can
[2:03:48] exist is your lack of faith and that's
[2:03:51] why my only thing I'm doing this
[2:03:53] afternoon is to encourage you to have
[2:03:55] faith in God because the devil don't
[2:03:59] forget we must not be oblivious of all
[2:04:02] his actions because he understand that
[2:04:05] he's on his last run we in the last
[2:04:08] stage so he's bringing in all his
[2:04:11] weapons every possible weapon are now in
[2:04:15] use but the Bible told us that we should
[2:04:18] be careful because Christ has overcome
[2:04:20] the world he told us we are more than
[2:04:23] conqueror through him that loved us so
[2:04:26] regardless of whatever weapon the enemy
[2:04:28] is deploying is just wasting his time we
[2:04:32] are going from Victory onto Victory
[2:04:36] Hallelujah from anointing to anointing
[2:04:40] from promotion to promotion oh why the
[2:04:44] prophet said why is so hard for people
[2:04:46] to live a Christian life because they
[2:04:48] are trying to do it themselves you know
[2:04:51] they are looking at all the problems oh
[2:04:53] this look onto the author and finisher
[2:04:56] of your faith he is the one that promis
[2:05:00] and is the one that will perform that's
[2:05:02] right Hallelujah Brethren the angel of
[2:05:05] Covenant is in you
[2:05:07] today he in you and with that in you you
[2:05:11] can face all opposition hallelujah
[2:05:14] hallelujah the prophet told us of an
[2:05:16] experience a man you know he was always
[2:05:18] carrying the Bible but he can't even
[2:05:21] from
[2:05:23] so somebody told him why do you always
[2:05:25] carry this Bible you don't even know how
[2:05:28] to read he said well there are two
[2:05:31] things first I want people to know that
[2:05:35] I believe every word of the Bible
[2:05:38] including the Holy Bible written in the
[2:05:41] front secondly I want people to know the
[2:05:45] side I am
[2:05:46] on Hallelujah let them know I'm a
[2:05:49] Christian you know Bible said let your
[2:05:51] your moderations be known to all men for
[2:05:55] the Lord is at turn so the man said okay
[2:05:58] if we can read for you in that Bible
[2:06:01] that um the Bible said go through this
[2:06:04] world will you do it he said yes I will
[2:06:08] because before I get there God Will Make
[2:06:10] A Way Brethren I want you to believe
[2:06:13] that that whatever situation faces you
[2:06:17] today God Will Make A Way I want us to
[2:06:20] rise up let's talk to God in our own way
[2:06:23] talk to him God I know you are here with
[2:06:25] me today you are the angel of Covenant I
[2:06:28] want to see the impact of your presence
