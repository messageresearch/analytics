[40:01] there was a Christian organization that
[40:04] talked to to settle many of them back
[40:07] home and so one of the places that they
[40:11] were set to work was in Liberia and
[40:15] the foreign
[40:22] so they were settled there and then and
[40:24] many of them that went back uh turned
[40:28] out to be
[40:29] shouting uh about his people so they
[40:34] started the Providence Baptist Church
[40:36] that's one of the oldest historical
[40:38] church uh there in Liberia
[40:42] so we were just I was just checking with
[40:45] him and then he was giving me a little
[40:46] history that's where he and his wife

[44:42] [Applause]
[44:48] praise the Lord we thank the Lord
[44:50] and we had brother
[44:54] Emmanuel and sister Vera with us
[44:58] and I think
[45:00] this is pretty much over a month now
[45:03] that they've been away
[45:06] and but a man was supposed to be
[45:07] returning back home to his postal Duty
[45:12] and in things that he had to do but just
[45:15] like I said couple of Sundays ago he
[45:18] came ahead of his wife so I never had
[45:20] him to greet the church
[45:22] was waiting for his wife to come and
[45:25] then just at the time his wife came he
[45:28] just had a few
[45:30] Sundays here then he will be going so
[45:33] I spoke with him Wednesday night
[45:35] I think this is a
[45:42] if I'm right now a few four five years
[45:46] now
[45:47] that they have choose to make
[45:50] this place a second home whenever they
[45:53] are over in the states so we are always
[45:57] glad and privileged to have them so I
[46:00] told Brother Emmanuel that I will have
[46:02] him to greet the church before he leaves
[46:04] since we he never did it when he came so
[46:07] it must be a greeting in the fair War so
[46:11] praise the Lord but Emmanuel you can
[46:13] come
[46:14] and
[46:19] [Applause]
[46:46] may God bless you
[46:49] profoundly
[46:50] and deeply in our soul
[46:53] s
[46:55] and also for your Eternal salvation
[47:00] pastel I want to thank the pastor
[47:04] they may donate
[47:06] opportunity for eign
[47:12] to take a time and to greet the church
[47:16] that has has been so precious to the
[47:18] Lord Jesus Christ
[47:20] foreign
[47:28] for the Salvation of each and every one
[47:31] of us
[47:38] and my heart is at the same time in my
[47:41] country and here
[47:44] and here as I have a family as well
[47:48] it's all of you that are sitting here
[47:52] [Music]
[47:55] it is a privilege to fellowship with you
[47:59] [Music]
[48:06] probably next Sunday I'm not going to be
[48:09] in church because I'll be already gone
[48:11] back home I'll be already home simple
[48:13] questions
[48:17] and I feel like this is just an occasion
[48:20] to greet you all uh
[48:26] [Music]
[48:33] once again
[48:37] petite reflection and this morning I had
[48:40] just a thought uh said petite reflection
[48:46] so that thought is like a paradox
[48:52] and we see the scientific men
[48:55] the
[48:59] the desperation and the worry more about
[49:03] the spirit the the the
[49:06] presentation to keep that to preserve
[49:10] the species
[49:12] [Music]
[49:18] and we see that the rest of the the race
[49:22] of Jesus Christ nobody cares about
[49:25] and the narratives of Jesus Christ
[49:28] sometimes they don't pay attention to it
[49:30] he
[49:31] is so cute
[49:35] it's more about how the species are
[49:37] being are disappearing
[49:41] and apostasy that is happening and
[49:44] sinking into the the world
[49:48] and the children of Jesus Christ are
[49:51] dying person and no man is even worrying
[49:55] about it
[50:02] we have the responsibility to keep our
[50:05] inheritance in Jesus Christ is
[50:11] and that inheritance includes the the
[50:14] parents and the young ones
[50:17] [Music]
[50:19] and you will notice that Satan today
[50:25] [Music]
[50:26] is fighting against the reproduction of
[50:30] Christians
[50:32] in July it will kill marriage
[50:37] divorce and it will even reinforce
[50:40] divorce
[50:42] is
[50:47] trying to make is trying to convince
[50:49] people that they should not have
[50:50] children
[50:53] and is fighting against
[50:56] young people
[50:58] [Music]
[51:00] so that the young people would not
[51:03] reproduce themselves in Jesus Christ
[51:05] and what's the consequences
[51:07] is apostasis
[51:15] it's the the fight against the
[51:18] inheritance of God it's like Satan
[51:21] [Music]
[51:24] responsibility that's what the young
[51:27] people has a great responsibility
[51:29] [Music]
[51:31] and to have true and Christian marriages
[51:40] and to produce Christians that can
[51:43] perpetuate the seed of Jesus Christ
[51:45] [Music]
[51:49] and we have also the responsibility as
[51:51] parents
[51:56] [Music]
[51:57] to help the young people to produce
[52:00] Jesus Christ in their heart
[52:02] [Music]
[52:07] and also to manifest the life of Jesus
[52:10] Christ in us
[52:12] so that tomorrow and after tomorrow
[52:17] we can have Christians that will fight
[52:19] for Jesus Christ
[52:24] [Music]
[52:25] that's what I've kept a little quote of
[52:28] brother when I'm here
[52:33] take inside with Jesus Christ
[52:37] in the 49th paragraph says
[52:43] it is a message that is preached in June
[52:46] 1st 1962 in Jeffersonville
[52:51] now we have to think about the young
[52:53] people
[52:55] we have children
[52:58] and most of us here
[53:04] we have children
[53:07] guess
[53:12] what about those that will come after
[53:15] them
[53:18] we have to think on others
[53:24] we have to think about those that are
[53:26] coming after us
[53:28] and the young ones
[53:32] and a place for our little ones our
[53:34] children
[53:36] our daughters
[53:40] we don't want to see them in the world
[53:43] done they show us decision the things of
[53:46] such of the
[53:48] kinds
[53:51] we want this door to grow up to be
[53:54] raised like the mothers the disposition
[53:57] and we have to make precaution
[53:59] preparation for that
[54:03] and if we don't have a tomorrow
[54:06] we don't know
[54:17] so if we don't have tomorrow then we
[54:20] have nothing to do when concerning the
[54:22] work of
[54:24] [Music]
[54:35] [Music]
[54:42] so that we can pay attention
[54:45] as Christians
[54:48] [Music]
[54:49] if we don't we do not have uh Christian
[54:53] children for tomorrow
[54:55] so
[54:58] [Music]
[55:08] right
[55:12] so if we do not pay attention

[1:03:52] message I was entitled to science in the
[1:03:55] library of God in the laboratory of God
[1:03:59] but I couldn't get all my slides
[1:04:01] together
[1:04:03] I wanted to show some some images on the
[1:04:08] DNA
[1:04:09] I couldn't get all of those flies

[1:04:15] we will we will find a time to bring it
[1:04:17] to you
[1:04:18] uh so uh I I went back and I started uh
[1:04:23] went back to a message that I preached
[1:04:25] many years ago I called entitled to a
[1:04:28] generation conflict
[1:04:30] so we will speak this morning on
[1:04:31] generation conflict uh I look at my
[1:04:34] notes and I think back in 2014 I spoke
[1:04:39] on the idea so
[1:04:41] that's a long time amen
[1:04:43] praise the Lord
[1:04:47] so as chapter 17
[1:05:01] chapter 17.
[1:05:06] if we were just read from verse 22
[1:05:09] .
[1:05:12] then pause to
[1:05:14] in the midst of Mars Hill and said yeah
[1:05:17] men of Alton I perceived that in all
[1:05:20] things here are two superstitious
[1:05:23] for us are passed by
[1:05:26] and beheld your devotion I found and
[1:05:30] altered with this inscription to the
[1:05:32] unknown God
[1:05:34] whom therefore ye ignorantly worship Him
[1:05:38] declare are unto you
[1:05:41] praise the Lord
[1:05:43] God that made the word in all things
[1:05:48] therein
[1:05:49] seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and
[1:05:54] Earth
[1:05:57] made with hands
[1:06:00] neither is worship with man's hands as
[1:06:04] though he needed anything seeing he gave
[1:06:09] it to all life
[1:06:11] and breath in all things
[1:06:15] and have made of one blood
[1:06:20] all nations of men
[1:06:24] for to the word on the face of the Earth
[1:06:27] and have determined the times before
[1:06:32] appointed and the bounds of their
[1:06:34] habitation
[1:06:36] praise the Lord
[1:06:40] and have made of warm blood
[1:06:44] all nations of man now if you study that
[1:06:48] verse
[1:06:50] the Bible says all Nation

[1:11:05] maybe sometimes in the future I can tell
[1:11:07] you all of the story you know I was I

[1:11:16] day I'm having my second wife
[1:11:21] praise the Lord
[1:11:24] so you can go home and just think about
[1:11:26] it
[1:11:32] praise the Lord
[1:11:33] and what are you what are you believing
[1:11:35] on that
[1:11:37] what are you believing on that
[1:11:39] from Romans chapter 7.
[1:11:42] you realize that
[1:11:45] every one of us and with you that are
[1:11:48] now married you will know it but as you
[1:11:51] go up you will get to know it and uh you
[1:11:55] every every relationship you marry your
[1:11:58] first wife and this is there's a time
[1:12:00] where you marry your second wife
[1:12:03] this is done where you marry your first
[1:12:04] husband there's a time where you marry
[1:12:06] your second husband it's not another
[1:12:08] person
[1:12:09] is in the same Union
[1:12:13] praise the Lord amen
[1:12:15] as you walk down the aisle after a
[1:12:19] couple of years
[1:12:21] you get to realize that you really now
[1:12:25] married to the person you walk down the
[1:12:27] eye with
[1:12:28] you know
[1:12:30] so uh
[1:12:32] it's a mystery
[1:12:34] a beautiful mystery
[1:12:38] there was a Derek father Samuel field he
[1:12:43] preached our message many years ago the
[1:12:46] day I married my second wife
[1:12:48] and it was an outstanding message
[1:12:53] very beautiful message
[1:12:55] just talking about the beautiful changes
[1:12:59] the things you learned as you go along
[1:13:01] in your union
[1:13:03] and how you grow and how you be you you
[1:13:06] start to appreciate the person that you
[1:13:10] thought was so nagging the person you
[1:13:13] taught that was so impatient but as you
[1:13:16] go along you start to appreciate praise
[1:13:19] the Lord
[1:13:20] I will not use that for now but uh
[1:13:29] so this morning we want to talk on
[1:13:31] generation conflict
[1:13:33] we want to talk on generation conflict
[1:13:35] that's uh that's a that's a Bible verse
[1:13:37] that caught my attention
[1:13:40] in Acts chapter 17.
[1:13:42] uh in Acts chapter 17.
[1:13:46] [Music]
[1:13:47] when you look in at verse 6 in Acts
[1:13:50] chapter 17 the Bible says verse 5 but
[1:13:53] the Jews which believe not move with
[1:13:56] envied and took them and talking to them
[1:13:59] certain little fellows and all the best
[1:14:03] assault and gather a company and set all
[1:14:07] the city on an opera
[1:14:09] and assaulted the house of Jason and
[1:14:12] sought to bring them out to the people
[1:14:15] and when they found him
[1:14:18] they they drew them uh
[1:14:21] they drew Jason and certain brethrens
[1:14:24] onto the rulers of the city crying these
[1:14:29] that have turned the word upside down
[1:14:34] these thou have turned the word upside
[1:14:38] down
[1:14:39] what an accusation
[1:14:42] what a way for the man to be accused
[1:14:45] praise the Lord
[1:14:47] amen
[1:14:48] now these they have robbed our homes
[1:14:52] all these that have defied the women's
[1:14:54] of the city but these that have turned
[1:14:56] the word upside down that was the
[1:15:00] testimony of of the Apostle and then and
[1:15:03] while I was thinking about that uh
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:07] I taught about uh uh What uh Paul said
[1:15:12] in Hebrew chapter 13 and others have
[1:15:15] have uh Trials of cruel Morgan and
[1:15:19] scorching yeah moreover of Bounce and
[1:15:22] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[1:15:24] sore asunder they they were tempted they
[1:15:27] were slain with the sword they wandered
[1:15:29] about in ships sheepskins and goatskins
[1:15:32] being destitute reflected into merited
[1:15:35] of whom the word was not worthy
[1:15:40] praise the Lord
[1:15:42] and that's the reason why they turned
[1:15:44] the word upside down
[1:15:46] because the word was not wanted of them
[1:15:51] praise the Lord
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:54] and we and we are promised in the
[1:15:57] scripture that we are going to be the
[1:16:00] continuation
[1:16:02] of the attorney of Saddam
[1:16:04] praise the Lord our life our testimony
[1:16:08] is going to turn the word upside down
[1:16:12] Amen in such an age of violence and and
[1:16:17] and and and and all that that you know
[1:16:19] the assaults and the evil things that
[1:16:21] are happening out there someone can look
[1:16:24] at the life of a young person and says
[1:16:26] uh I mean you are actually turning the
[1:16:29] word upside down when you are living
[1:16:31] normal
[1:16:34] amen because the action of the word is
[1:16:37] already upside down brother Braham said
[1:16:39] the word is falling apart
[1:16:42] it can hold
[1:16:46] Paul says everything is shaking
[1:16:50] praise the Lord
[1:16:52] so uh the word was now worthy of them
[1:17:00] and the word is now worthy of us also
[1:17:04] praise the Lord
[1:17:07] now my my my my inspiration
[1:17:12] is actually coming from sin Luke chapter
[1:17:14] four but let's look at this uh this uh
[1:17:18] uh statement here that Paul May or that
[1:17:21] that uh Luke made over here in uh
[1:17:28] Acts chapter 17.
[1:17:32] the Bible says they are the poor there
[1:17:35] at Mars Hill
[1:17:37] the scripture we read I want to go back
[1:17:39] there to verse 26 again where he says
[1:17:41] and have made of one blood
[1:17:45] All Nation
[1:17:47] now you have to realize that the
[1:17:50] translator the the uh honor the burden
[1:17:56] of trying to bring the word of God or
[1:17:59] publish the word of God they did their
[1:18:02] best to be able to come close to how
[1:18:05] they can be able to describe setting
[1:18:08] texts in the Bible
[1:18:11] but this this verse
[1:18:17] made of one blood All Nation
[1:18:22] is so powerful
[1:18:25] the other
[1:18:27] uh
[1:18:31] it actually goes back and speak of our
[1:18:35] DNA
[1:18:39] it goes back and it speaks of our DNA
[1:18:44] do you know do you know that uh
[1:18:48] when signs discover
[1:18:52] the DNA code
[1:18:55] it was one of the major explosion
[1:19:00] because the discovery of the DNA called
[1:19:04] actually
[1:19:07] destroy the evolution Theory
[1:19:13] praise the Lord
[1:19:16] it's us it's it's it's actual fact you
[1:19:18] can go and you can go and Google it you
[1:19:20] can set it on it the discovery of the
[1:19:22] dnico actually
[1:19:26] this straw
[1:19:28] the the evolution Theory
[1:19:31] and uh and and and and science
[1:19:35] are still looking into it they are
[1:19:38] staying is is blowing your mind it's
[1:19:40] blowing the mind of Science and and what
[1:19:43] they are discovering is they are like
[1:19:46] like every Every Act One Time brother
[1:19:49] Barry coffee was preaching here for us
[1:19:51] and then he was he was actually talking
[1:19:54] to something I can remember
[1:19:56] but uh he turned this picture around and
[1:20:00] he has this there's a signature behind
[1:20:02] it
[1:20:03] to prove that I mean they were the one
[1:20:06] that were publishing it they were the
[1:20:07] ones that made it there are many of you
[1:20:08] that can remember that and and and that
[1:20:12] is what every great ethics around the
[1:20:16] world
[1:20:17] they were always put
[1:20:19] their autographed on their work
[1:20:24] and by the DNA called signs have come to
[1:20:28] discover
[1:20:31] that the signature of God
[1:20:35] it's on our DNA
[1:20:40] praise the Lord
[1:20:43] amen
[1:20:44] that God's signature so when the
[1:20:47] scriptures say of one blood
[1:20:51] amen
[1:20:52] is going is going far beyond
[1:20:56] just your blood cells is going to your
[1:21:00] DNA
[1:21:01] is speaking of your DNA
[1:21:05] science has be they are beginning to
[1:21:08] realize
[1:21:10] that your life is a book
[1:21:15] your life is a book
[1:21:19] I'll prove it to you
[1:21:22] when you are sick
[1:21:26] you go to the doctor
[1:21:28] and you tell the doctor I'm having
[1:21:31] headache my head is pounding me
[1:21:34] the doctor said okay
[1:21:37] since when
[1:21:38] he asks you all of these questions just
[1:21:42] to get a clued
[1:21:44] but he's not going to make a
[1:21:47] prescription on that Claude
[1:21:49] what is he going to do he's going to
[1:21:52] take a test
[1:21:54] he's going to ask for your blood
[1:21:57] because through your blood he can be
[1:22:01] able to read
[1:22:03] the language that is in yourselves
[1:22:10] praise the Lord
[1:22:15] and uh
[1:22:22] are we together
[1:22:38] I want to get ahead of myself here
[1:22:41] but uh let me read this here in birth
[1:22:44] pains for you
[1:22:48] science has broke into God's Great
[1:22:51] Laboratory
[1:22:52] until they are going to destroy
[1:22:55] themselves
[1:22:56] God always let wisdom destroy himself
[1:22:58] God doesn't destroy anything man
[1:23:01] destroyed himself by wisdom
[1:23:03] as he did at the beginning taking
[1:23:05] Satan's wisdom instead of God's word
[1:23:09] praise the Lord
[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:13] and uh
[1:23:19] okay
[1:23:21] okay
[1:23:24] now uh uh faith in action they got an
[1:23:28] x-ray now this was back in in 1955
[1:23:33] they would take your picture
[1:23:36] without any light
[1:23:38] so the Bible said your body is full of
[1:23:41] light
[1:23:43] and we come to find out the old
[1:23:47] scientists said that was crazy there was
[1:23:50] no light in your body but the Bible says
[1:23:53] your whole your your whole body is full
[1:23:56] of light
[1:23:57] and we find out today that your body is
[1:24:00] made up of light meters
[1:24:03] x-ray prove it
[1:24:07] it takes your own light from your body
[1:24:12] to take the picture on the inside of you
[1:24:18] so God's right after all
[1:24:22] praise the Lord now a person could be in
[1:24:27] in in in a terrible accident
[1:24:30] and then and then they can be lying in
[1:24:32] common for you know as long as they want
[1:24:36] to
[1:24:39] one of the things that the doctors that
[1:24:41] would bring Comfort to the doctors if
[1:24:44] they can be able
[1:24:46] to go to your intelligence
[1:24:50] if if your brain cells is working the
[1:24:54] doctors can be hopeful
[1:24:57] praise the Lord if they cannot
[1:25:00] communicate with your brain they will
[1:25:01] not know what to do with you why because
[1:25:04] that's your intelligence
[1:25:07] if they can get a signal from your brain
[1:25:09] they can know which part of your body
[1:25:11] that they can help
[1:25:15] praise the Lord
[1:25:17] so there is a great laboratory that sign
[1:25:19] says it's a library
[1:25:22] Now Now lies within the human DNA
[1:25:31] praise the Lord
[1:25:34] and God designed it that way
[1:25:38] almighty God design it that way
[1:25:42] so we will realize that the things
[1:25:48] the things
[1:25:51] that divide us
[1:25:55] are more meneal to the things that
[1:25:58] connect us
[1:26:02] praise the Lord
[1:26:04] amen
[1:26:07] the thing that connect us is more major
[1:26:13] Jesus never made a mistake he was not he
[1:26:17] was not looking for words he was not
[1:26:19] stuttering when he said give unto Caesar
[1:26:22] what is Caesar
[1:26:26] and gave unto God what is God
[1:26:29] he was now stuttering
[1:26:32] praise the Lord
[1:26:34] because what he did was that he asked
[1:26:36] them for the Roman
[1:26:38] coin and he says who image is on it
[1:26:43] they said Caesar and he said give it to
[1:26:45] Caesar
[1:26:47] then give to God
[1:26:51] what is God
[1:26:52] and you can only be able to give to God
[1:26:54] what is God if you see his signature on
[1:26:57] it
[1:27:01] if you can be able to identify God's
[1:27:03] signature in your life
[1:27:07] if you can realize that the signature of
[1:27:10] almighty God is on your DNA
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:15] until that becomes a revelation to you
[1:27:18] you would think that you own your life
[1:27:21] and you can run it the way you want to
[1:27:23] run it
[1:27:26] you will never come to truth
[1:27:28] submissiveness and surrounding life to
[1:27:31] Christ until that become a personal
[1:27:34] revelation
[1:27:38] you will try your best to give
[1:27:41] but until it becomes a revelation
[1:27:44] you will not be able to give to God
[1:27:47] as I was studying on this I mean there
[1:27:49] were just a lot of things that were just
[1:27:51] that were just they were just flying on
[1:27:53] me
[1:27:55] and uh I couldn't keep up with it
[1:27:59] I really couldn't keep up with faith and
[1:28:01] one of those things was the other uh
[1:28:13] our science is as they are looking into
[1:28:16] this as they have you know discovering
[1:28:19] this I mean it's just it's blowing their
[1:28:20] mind all over and I believe that
[1:28:22] almighty God kept it for this time amen
[1:28:25] because uh uh
[1:28:29] that's that's the way the Bible
[1:28:30] prophesied
[1:28:32] that it was going to be
[1:28:37] Hallelujah
[1:28:44] science is realizes something here that
[1:28:46] it says they are there with all the the
[1:28:49] the the technology
[1:28:53] with all the technology
[1:28:56] that we are having in the word and I
[1:28:58] mean technology is just speeding so fast
[1:29:02] that we can't catch up with it
[1:29:05] we having we having so much technology
[1:29:09] in the word
[1:29:11] that we we have not we have not come in
[1:29:14] terms to to adjust ourselves you you
[1:29:17] realize that you know this is uh you
[1:29:20] know uh uh uh
[1:29:22] Samsung Port out uh uh 23 Australian
[1:29:27] iPhone Port of their latest phone uh I
[1:29:29] mean you get the phone you you have not
[1:29:31] even understand how to use it then the
[1:29:34] next one come up
[1:29:36] praise the Lord amen and you you don't
[1:29:40] even understand all the future you know
[1:29:42] how to really enjoy that phone and use
[1:29:45] everything the way that you're supposed
[1:29:47] to use it and then a new one comes up
[1:29:49] and then you have to go for the install
[1:29:50] anything and then a new one comes up so
[1:29:54] we are far behind
[1:29:58] but this is something that was tracking
[1:30:01] to them
[1:30:02] is that with all the technology
[1:30:07] we have never been able
[1:30:10] all the technology that we have in the
[1:30:12] world
[1:30:14] has never been able to bring us a
[1:30:16] solution to our differences
[1:30:24] praise the Lord you see that's the
[1:30:26] reason why the technology
[1:30:29] is not it's not helping us
[1:30:33] in the right direction
[1:30:35] but rather the technology
[1:30:41] is only bringing us to the place where
[1:30:44] man is destroying themself
[1:30:51] praise the Lord
[1:30:57] that man is destroying using it to
[1:31:01] destroy themself
[1:31:03] you think about all of this knowledge
[1:31:09] and now they have drones to go and fight
[1:31:11] War they have they have uh I mean all of
[1:31:14] that you know I mean you know my my mind
[1:31:17] uh and and uh
[1:31:20] all the artificial intelligence and all
[1:31:24] of those things that is coming and yet
[1:31:26] we are having more problems
[1:31:31] praise the Lord
[1:31:32] with the technology that the world is
[1:31:35] having we must not be having
[1:31:39] hunger problem
[1:31:43] praise the Lord
[1:31:45] amen if the technology are directed in
[1:31:50] the right place
[1:31:57] okay for example the most common one
[1:31:58] this the the the the cell phone
[1:32:03] and all the apps the the Facebook the
[1:32:06] Twitter then and the rest of them
[1:32:09] if all of those things were directed in
[1:32:12] the right place we must not be having
[1:32:15] teenagers that are taking their own life
[1:32:23] if there were Direction in the right
[1:32:25] place we we we will not need or send our
[1:32:28] children to school they could stay right
[1:32:30] home and use those things and learn
[1:32:35] and use their basement as their
[1:32:38] laboratory where they can be producing
[1:32:39] things by themselves
[1:32:45] praise the Lord
[1:32:49] so there's a problem there's a conflict
[1:32:52] somewhere
[1:32:53] there's a conflict somewhere
[1:32:57] that no matter how much money we have
[1:33:00] how much wealth we have how much
[1:33:03] knowledge we have is never bringing us
[1:33:06] to the place
[1:33:07] to solve our differences
[1:33:16] praise the Lord
[1:33:18] so the problem is now poverty
[1:33:25] that's a generation conflict
[1:33:30] we might not be able to talk about
[1:33:32] everything today but we can start amen
[1:33:35] there is always a starting point
[1:33:38] praise the Lord and if you give me one
[1:33:41] of those starting point I appreciate the
[1:33:42] same message for the rest of the year
[1:33:45] because I get down on the Rabbit Trail
[1:33:47] and how to get out of there praise the
[1:33:49] Lord
[1:33:51] Saint John chapter 4 let's go to the
[1:33:53] book of Saint John chapter 4.
[1:33:56] praise the Lord
[1:34:00] sister Faith says show she knows me very
[1:34:02] well
[1:34:05] amen
[1:34:08] until sometimes they have to help me to
[1:34:10] change the the same on title
[1:34:13] and then I go online I look at this
[1:34:16] when did I preach this
[1:34:22] praise the Lord
[1:34:24] see John chapter four
[1:34:27] Saint John chapter 4
[1:34:31] is a very very very unique you I mean
[1:34:35] the all true church history
[1:34:37] this scripture has been used by many
[1:34:40] evangelists on the field and uh you know
[1:34:43] and and and many people
[1:34:46] you know is is being greatly used
[1:34:51] and a horse a horse a whole lot of Truth
[1:34:57] it holds a whole lot of for history
[1:35:01] and I pray that the Lord will be can can
[1:35:04] help us for us to be able to get there
[1:35:06] with because we don't have time today
[1:35:07] and we're trying to start up this let's
[1:35:11] just go read it from verse six
[1:35:17] maybe another time I would give you a
[1:35:19] background and give you some of the
[1:35:21] history that is right in there now Jacob
[1:35:24] well was there Jesus therefore being
[1:35:28] worried of his journey
[1:35:30] South thus
[1:35:31] on the well
[1:35:35] praise the Lord
[1:35:40] and it was about the sixth hour
[1:35:45] there come at the woman of Samira to
[1:35:48] draw water
[1:35:49] Jesus said unto her give me to drink
[1:35:54] for this for his disciple we're going
[1:35:57] away into the city to buy meat
[1:35:59] then said a woman of Samira unto him how
[1:36:04] is it
[1:36:07] and this will be our verse for today
[1:36:12] how is it
[1:36:14] that thou being the Jews
[1:36:17] ask it dream of me
[1:36:20] which I'm a woman
[1:36:22] of Samira
[1:36:25] for the Jews have no dealing
[1:36:31] no dealing
[1:36:35] generation conflict
[1:36:38] for the Jews have no dealing
[1:36:45] when did it start
[1:36:48] I don't believe that she's the one that
[1:36:50] is making it up
[1:36:55] for her to be able to get to that place
[1:36:57] and say why are you asking me
[1:37:00] we have no dealing
[1:37:04] she's taking it from somewhere I don't
[1:37:06] believe it was something that happened
[1:37:07] yesterday
[1:37:17] for the Jews have no dealing
[1:37:20] with the Samaritans
[1:37:24] praise the Lord
[1:37:27] for the Jews have no dealing
[1:37:30] with the Samaritans he
[1:37:39] let's go back a little bit
[1:37:42] let's look at the uh
[1:37:44] uh some some latest story here
[1:37:48] or history yeah the Jews
[1:37:51] have no dealing with the Samaritans
[1:37:59] praise the Lord
[1:38:08] okay
[1:38:17] now you when you look back they had a
[1:38:19] lot just like I said you know talking
[1:38:20] about translation a little bit here that
[1:38:23] were dealing it was borrowed it's a
[1:38:25] borrow word that is you but actually it
[1:38:27] means that there was just no communion
[1:38:29] there was no communion there was just
[1:38:31] there were there were just no communion
[1:38:33] we see some few things in the scripture
[1:38:35] that would prove there too to us
[1:38:38] that's that's where the origin of the
[1:38:40] word comes from it comes from together
[1:38:43] uh uh hence it's been honestly to me
[1:38:47] that the Jews will
[1:38:50] be on no kind of obligation
[1:38:54] to the Samaritans
[1:38:56] amen no kind of obligation we borrow
[1:39:00] nothing from them will not drink out of
[1:39:04] the same cup
[1:39:06] now you can see why she said that
[1:39:14] amen
[1:39:16] when I drink of the same cup or the the
[1:39:19] same well with them will now sit down to
[1:39:23] meet with them not eat
[1:39:27] in the same vessel
[1:39:29] with them praise the Lord
[1:39:32] we have no religious connection
[1:39:36] no commercial dealing with them
[1:39:40] praise the Lord
[1:39:43] are we together
[1:39:48] okay
[1:39:50] the word convenient I think fully
[1:39:52] expressed the sense of the original as
[1:39:55] being
[1:39:57] as uh extensive in its meaning in all
[1:40:00] words dealing
[1:40:02] now there's a little history that is
[1:40:05] attached to this we will not have time
[1:40:07] to go but just like I said I will bring
[1:40:08] you the historical part of it because it
[1:40:11] it goes back to the days of Ahab
[1:40:15] when one time Samira was was choosing
[1:40:18] and made as the capital
[1:40:21] and then it became a a a trailing center
[1:40:25] for the syrians the syrians come into
[1:40:27] Trail they made their Trail and and
[1:40:30] after the period of time uh uh uh the
[1:40:33] the people in the place starts to lose
[1:40:36] their identity
[1:40:38] but we will go we will go ahead here
[1:40:42] now what I want to show you also in this
[1:40:45] is that in Luke chapter 10
[1:40:49] Jesus was asked a question
[1:40:52] who is my neighbor
[1:40:55] amen
[1:40:57] when he was telling this tribe the two
[1:41:00] Commandments What is the greatest Jesus
[1:41:02] says
[1:41:03] love the Lord with all of your heart and
[1:41:04] love your neighbor he said who is my
[1:41:06] neighbor
[1:41:07] Jesus sees the opportunity
[1:41:11] and now he's going to explain
[1:41:15] in God's mind the way he see what this
[1:41:18] is Jesus now will bring out the storage
[1:41:22] of the Good Samaritan
[1:41:25] which of course it was it will blast the
[1:41:29] mind of a Jewish rabbi
[1:41:32] because he's talking about the Lord he's
[1:41:35] talking about the Torah and yeah Jesus
[1:41:38] is now bringing in a story
[1:41:41] that will now shows how the people are
[1:41:45] are rejected by the Levites because the
[1:41:48] the Levi saw the man never did anything
[1:41:50] the priest came and saw the man he never
[1:41:52] did anything it took the Samaritan
[1:41:57] praise the Lord
[1:41:59] now to a Jewish robot that is offensive
[1:42:05] at least if you want to make an example
[1:42:07] use somebody else don't use a Samaritan
[1:42:14] are we together are you getting the
[1:42:15] picture but you see Jesus did that for a
[1:42:18] reason
[1:42:23] are we together
[1:42:25] now you will see another scripture there
[1:42:27] I hope you can see well and uh in sin
[1:42:31] Luke chapter 17.
[1:42:33] is in Luke chapter 17.
[1:42:37] and I say it again and see Luke chapter
[1:42:40] 17.
[1:42:42] there's a reason why I said it three
[1:42:44] times
[1:42:45] because I want you to wake up
[1:42:48] I don't want you to sleep under me
[1:42:51] I want your thinking cap to start
[1:42:53] working we have a promise in Luke
[1:42:55] chapter 17.
[1:42:57] the revelation of the son of man
[1:43:02] but yeah you see Luke chapter 17 Jesus
[1:43:06] will also introduce another story or
[1:43:11] Luke will talk about a story and that is
[1:43:13] that 10 lepers
[1:43:15] um
[1:43:16] amen there are 10 lepers that saw Jesus
[1:43:22] and the scripture says and as he entered
[1:43:25] into the village there met him 10 men
[1:43:27] that were leper lepers wish to afford
[1:43:32] off and they lifted up their voices and
[1:43:35] said Jesus Master have mercy on us
[1:43:41] and Jesus said Go and show yourself to
[1:43:43] the priests
[1:43:46] praise the Lord
[1:43:48] the Bible says they left
[1:43:51] but one man returned
[1:43:55] praise the Lord
[1:43:56] now wash it here now verse 16 and fell
[1:44:00] down at his
[1:44:02] fell down on his face at his feet giving
[1:44:05] him thanks
[1:44:07] and he was a Samaritan
[1:44:12] why because the nine word
[1:44:16] Jews
[1:44:19] being a Samaritan he will not be
[1:44:22] accepted into
[1:44:24] the synagas
[1:44:26] [Music]
[1:44:27] praise the Lord
[1:44:28] amen but not only that not only that
[1:44:34] what I want you to grab here is that
[1:44:38] it is only the illit
[1:44:43] of every age
[1:44:46] there will recognize the word of their
[1:44:49] day
[1:44:53] praise the Lord
[1:44:54] amen
[1:44:56] now see Jesus is is dealing with this
[1:45:01] and pretty soon he's going to he's going
[1:45:04] to talk about the revelation of the son
[1:45:06] of man so what we can grab in picture
[1:45:09] here is there just like the uh our
[1:45:11] brother Baron told us this was a
[1:45:13] dispensational thing because it was a
[1:45:16] visitation to the Samaritans only the
[1:45:19] Samaritan could pick it up
[1:45:23] the other ones they returned back to
[1:45:25] their denomination
[1:45:27] but the Samaritan returned back to the
[1:45:30] word
[1:45:31] the Samaritan came back to Christ now
[1:45:34] see what Jesus said the Bible says and
[1:45:37] Jesus answered and said well then Martin
[1:45:40] claims
[1:45:42] but where are the nine
[1:45:45] they are not formed
[1:45:47] that returned to give glory to God self
[1:45:49] dear stranger
[1:45:53] praise the Lord
[1:45:54] another verse that will also help you
[1:45:56] it's in John chapter 8 that was what
[1:46:00] Jesus was having this conversation with
[1:46:02] uh with the Jews
[1:46:05] now talking about a father Abraham you
[1:46:08] know and all of that Abraham is your
[1:46:10] father
[1:46:12] and uh
[1:46:15] the Jews said unto him then answer the
[1:46:18] Jews and said unto him say we now well
[1:46:22] that thou are a Samaritan and have a
[1:46:24] devil now that that just gave you a
[1:46:28] picture of how much
[1:46:31] the Jews look at the Samaritans
[1:46:37] praise the Lord
[1:46:39] amen
[1:46:41] but the the story will get very very
[1:46:44] interesting when we go back and look at
[1:46:46] some some history that is attached to
[1:46:48] death
[1:46:49] so this was just to be able to give us a
[1:46:52] picture
[1:46:55] of what created this thing in this woman
[1:47:00] when she said
[1:47:03] we have no dealing
[1:47:07] praise the Lord
[1:47:08] why you asking me for water we have no
[1:47:11] dealing
[1:47:17] glory be to God
[1:47:20] if we are
[1:47:21] and by one block
[1:47:25] God created Army
[1:47:29] if every one of us
[1:47:31] have the signature
[1:47:37] has God's signature on our DNA
[1:47:41] welcome at this word no dealing
[1:47:45] praise the Lord
[1:47:48] welcome another word
[1:47:51] no dealing
[1:47:56] what we ever put a person in a place
[1:48:01] to ever think
[1:48:04] that they are better than the northern
[1:48:06] Malta
[1:48:15] praise the Lord
[1:48:17] generation conflict
[1:48:20] she's reacting on what her parents have
[1:48:23] told her
[1:48:24] information that have passed from one
[1:48:26] generation to another generation
[1:48:29] and his soul a soul installed in in in
[1:48:33] in in in the gene in the brains of the
[1:48:36] people
[1:48:38] and they can say no we are not the same
[1:48:40] why why we are not the same why what
[1:48:45] proof do you have we are not the same
[1:48:50] if this word Remains the Same that by
[1:48:53] warm blood
[1:48:55] God made all men
[1:48:59] if everything goes back to that one
[1:49:01] blood one gene cell
[1:49:11] praise the Lord
[1:49:19] there is no dealing
[1:49:22] generation conflict
[1:49:26] Hallelujah
[1:49:29] praise the Lord
[1:49:36] take for example
[1:49:39] you will realize
[1:49:42] this is this is this is always it's
[1:49:45] always mysterious
[1:49:49] people will fight
[1:49:52] they're trying to claim rights and
[1:49:54] privilege and you know and and you know
[1:49:56] position and whatever better class lower
[1:49:59] class you know any whatever name they
[1:50:01] can place it citizen immigrants and
[1:50:04] whatever
[1:50:06] but
[1:50:15] when there is a disaster
[1:50:20] when we have a disaster
[1:50:25] praise the Lord
[1:50:29] all we have
[1:50:33] take for example like uh we experienced
[1:50:36] the the the killing of George Floyd
[1:50:39] you will always realize when something
[1:50:44] unusual happened
[1:50:48] amen
[1:50:50] I always have to be something sorry for
[1:50:59] it is so easy for at that very moment
[1:51:03] people forget about their status
[1:51:07] they forget that we don't have dealing
[1:51:09] with one another
[1:51:11] right okay disaster is able to bring us
[1:51:14] together quickly
[1:51:18] praise the Lord
[1:51:21] but then when there is no disaster
[1:51:22] everybody gets to their class
[1:51:24] everybody get to their group no they are
[1:51:26] not part of us we are the origin of the
[1:51:29] other fake we are the high class they
[1:51:31] are the lower class but let something
[1:51:33] happen
[1:51:42] you realize that
[1:51:45] from the soul
[1:51:47] man is able to step out
[1:51:52] and realize he will realize that
[1:51:54] something has been Worthy
[1:51:58] praise the Lord
[1:52:02] you see family have they have forces and
[1:52:04] and quarrel among them and you know and
[1:52:07] you know they'll tell their children
[1:52:08] different things you know those people
[1:52:10] the days
[1:52:11] but when the next family have a problem
[1:52:14] a death in the family
[1:52:16] it's so easy for the man to step out of
[1:52:19] that cage
[1:52:21] and pretty soon he goes back and say oh
[1:52:23] I'm very sorry for your loss
[1:52:28] praise the Lord
[1:52:30] and as soon as that is over
[1:52:32] he goes right back into his prison
[1:52:36] his praising that makes him
[1:52:39] I mean he's the only one there he can
[1:52:40] smell what is there so he think is
[1:52:42] better than the next man praising
[1:52:46] he goes back into his praising
[1:52:50] he say I have more privilege than you
[1:52:52] because I was imprisoned in you
[1:52:57] generation come
[1:53:03] generation conflict
[1:53:09] the word has had Revival there has been
[1:53:12] a move of God they have been uh
[1:53:15] philosopher men that have brought great
[1:53:18] reason into the world there there have
[1:53:20] been a diff the word have experienced
[1:53:24] Astro ordinary things
[1:53:31] praise the Lord
[1:53:35] well yeah
[1:53:37] they have not been able
[1:53:40] to solve
[1:53:42] our problems
[1:53:44] of differences
[1:53:50] praise the Lord
[1:53:52] now follow me carefully and quietly
[1:53:55] because I think I've got you today
[1:53:57] quietly
[1:53:58] let me get you to the carefully now
[1:54:05] you will realize
[1:54:08] You Were Real Lies
[1:54:12] how
[1:54:17] the serpent sea
[1:54:19] teaching
[1:54:20] is the truth
[1:54:24] praise the Lord
[1:54:27] amen
[1:54:30] if from one block
[1:54:33] God made all men
[1:54:36] then something might have affected their
[1:54:39] blood
[1:54:42] there was an introduction of another
[1:54:44] bloodstream
[1:54:48] that God makes in Eden
[1:54:54] praise the Lord
[1:54:57] are we together
[1:55:00] if from one block
[1:55:03] God made all men
[1:55:09] then this conflict
[1:55:11] this generation conflict
[1:55:15] it is not because we are from different
[1:55:17] cities you are from you are we have yeah
[1:55:20] in the north you are from the sun no it
[1:55:22] is not because we are different tribes
[1:55:24] it is not because we are different race
[1:55:25] that's not where they begin from
[1:55:31] it's all because
[1:55:34] there was a strange blood cells
[1:55:38] that came in contact
[1:55:41] with the purest blood cell
[1:55:44] the Arden and Eve had
[1:55:50] and God bless Hero has introduced every
[1:55:53] conflict
[1:55:55] every conflict even the conflict we have
[1:55:58] with ourselves
[1:55:59] that sometimes we don't appreciate
[1:56:01] ourselves sometimes I mean we beat
[1:56:03] ourselves on the hill where I mean it's
[1:56:05] so hard for us to praise ourselves
[1:56:08] we always sing a lot of people are
[1:56:10] better than us
[1:56:14] even in the inward individual conflict
[1:56:17] we struggle with ourselves we struggle
[1:56:20] with our laws we struggle with our
[1:56:22] weight we struggle with our appetite we
[1:56:25] struggle with everything
[1:56:29] all comes from the blood a contrary
[1:56:32] blood cells
[1:56:39] because the prophet of God will say
[1:56:41] every one of us here at Birth
[1:56:45] from Genesis chapter 3.
[1:56:47] the Abominable other the seven heart
[1:56:49] will eat
[1:56:50] it brings another blood cells
[1:56:57] glory be to God
[1:57:03] size is very if science is ahead of the
[1:57:07] preachers
[1:57:09] because when science want to find your
[1:57:11] sickness they go and test your blood
[1:57:15] when the preachers want to know the
[1:57:16] problem of the church they go and look
[1:57:18] at their doctrines
[1:57:20] and they are bylaws
[1:57:22] the doctrines in the Bible says not the
[1:57:24] problem the problem is a blood problem
[1:57:27] it's a blood problem a lot of Doctrine
[1:57:31] problem
[1:57:36] because you can have all the doctrine
[1:57:39] from Genesis to Revelation if you don't
[1:57:42] have that purified blood if not the
[1:57:44] blood of God is not flowing through your
[1:57:46] veins you will take this Bible and do
[1:57:48] the most wickiest thing in the world
[1:57:55] is that a church problem it's not a
[1:57:57] Doctrine problem it's a block
[1:58:11] glory be to God
[1:58:16] Hallelujah
[1:58:20] we have our different Supernatural
[1:58:23] experience around the church we have had
[1:58:25] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on
[1:58:28] Azusa 3 we have the pillow of fire ever
[1:58:31] taking
[1:58:33] praise the Lord
[1:58:35] in all of history
[1:58:38] almighty God coming down
[1:58:42] we have heard all of that
[1:58:45] but yet we have a lot of differences
[1:58:52] just because of one sentence or another
[1:58:54] we have no dealing with those people
[1:58:58] we have no dealing with those people
[1:59:00] they have that Doctrine we have no
[1:59:02] dealing with those people
[1:59:07] blood problem
[1:59:13] is a blood problem
[1:59:18] is a blood problem
[1:59:21] you have not been disposed to the
[1:59:24] language that is in your DNA
[1:59:26] when you ever get exposed to the
[1:59:28] language that is in your DNA praise the
[1:59:31] Lord
[1:59:32] hallelujah when you ever get a sports
[1:59:35] and really read the language that is in
[1:59:37] your DNA
[1:59:47] there is nothing
[1:59:50] there is nothing
[1:59:54] that a man can do
[1:59:57] or a woman can do
[2:00:00] praise the Lord
[2:00:02] they can tarnish your name they can say
[2:00:05] whatever they want to say
[2:00:07] praise the Lord
[2:00:10] there will be no place to find Hate in
[2:00:13] Your Heart
[2:00:16] there will be no place of hatred
[2:00:32] foreign
[2:00:38] but it's okay
[2:00:40] it's okay
[2:00:42] glory be to God
[2:00:48] people can say whatever uh you know they
[2:00:52] want to say it I mean you you you look
[2:00:54] at all of these great Scholars and and
[2:00:56] and you know they try to prove and look
[2:00:59] there in Genesis chapter 6 and they'll
[2:01:00] talk about the Nephilim came down the
[2:01:02] the naphthalene they came down there
[2:01:04] they can't believe that falling angels
[2:01:07] can come down
[2:01:08] amen and have affair with women and but
[2:01:12] they cannot believe that accepting
[2:01:14] can do the same
[2:01:19] amen praise the Lord
[2:01:22] glory be to God
[2:01:26] amen Genesis
[2:01:27] was only an effect of Genesis 3.
[2:01:32] Genesis 6 never came before Genesis 3
[2:01:35] Genesis 3 came before Genesis 6.
[2:01:39] there was not a Genesis 6 if there was
[2:01:42] not a a blood minglory in Genesis 6 I
[2:01:46] mean Genesis 3 we will not have Genesis
[2:01:48] 6.
[2:01:55] oh okay
[2:02:00] oh may God help us this morning
[2:02:03] amen people of God may God help us
[2:02:08] that we rise above
[2:02:11] this generation conflict
[2:02:14] because I will tell you is in each and
[2:02:16] every one of you this morning
[2:02:19] even the guy that is preaching
[2:02:37] think about it
[2:02:39] think about it the Bible says
[2:02:44] the desert we bloomsome with roses
[2:02:49] when Israel went back and got their
[2:02:52] Homeland
[2:02:56] there are the the the uh uh uh they go
[2:03:01] back to the place and you know you if
[2:03:03] you look at the geographical uh uh
[2:03:06] position of Israel you see there it's a
[2:03:08] desolate
[2:03:12] amen it's a desert
[2:03:17] but on the basis of that word
[2:03:24] the Jews have always believed that it
[2:03:27] was God's promise to them
[2:03:29] that there's that were blown with roses
[2:03:34] and today Jerusalem have one of the best
[2:03:38] irrigation system
[2:03:43] is one of the most fruitful land
[2:03:48] they're even in the desert area
[2:03:52] they play food
[2:03:56] because what the word of God says so
[2:04:02] praise the Lord the word of God says so
[2:04:14] are we together
[2:04:22] and that same word that says that roses
[2:04:25] were bloom in the desert
[2:04:28] that same word says there will be a
[2:04:30] bride
[2:04:32] praise the Lord the same word said God
[2:04:35] will have a people that will give him
[2:04:38] the preeminence
[2:04:41] not a people that will become a church
[2:04:43] member but a people that will give him
[2:04:46] the preeminence
[2:04:49] a bride
[2:04:53] and if the desert can bloom with roses
[2:04:57] surely God do have a people not that God
[2:05:01] will have as saying God have a people
[2:05:04] that will put him above everything
[2:05:14] if you are not there yet
[2:05:16] it's because generation conflict
[2:05:19] is holding you back
[2:05:22] generation conflict is holding you back
[2:05:28] [Music]
[2:05:30] upon the Lord
[2:05:34] you trying to use your ability
[2:05:37] to take care of yourself
[2:05:40] is a conflict
[2:05:43] Paul say when I want to do good
[2:05:46] evil is always there there's a war that
[2:05:50] is in me who will deliver me from this
[2:05:52] Wretched Man that I am
[2:06:00] your fight is not outside people your
[2:06:03] fight is Right In You
[2:06:07] your fight is Right In You
[2:06:11] if you can break those change door
[2:06:14] praise the Lord if you can be like a
[2:06:17] something this morning pick up that
[2:06:19] chain upon your shoulder
[2:06:23] you will be one of the happiest
[2:06:25] more healthier person than ever lived
[2:06:28] upon the face of the Earth
[2:06:33] glory be today
[2:06:35] Hallelujah
[2:06:37] amen
[2:06:41] the Bible says the Lord is 90.
[2:06:45] the Lord is 90 the scripture says he
[2:06:48] cover all space
[2:06:51] all space god is more closer to you than
[2:06:55] even your breath that you breathe
[2:06:59] praise the Lord
[2:07:01] every time we say well let's pray let's
[2:07:03] invite the presence of the Lord he's
[2:07:04] been here before you even start praying
[2:07:06] why are you inviting him
[2:07:10] you can only make the law of
[2:07:14] his language is let's make him feel
[2:07:16] welcome because we get a lot of attitude
[2:07:19] that don't make God feel welcome
[2:07:25] feel welcome because he already here he
[2:07:28] filled every space
[2:07:30] the thing that is keeping you from God
[2:07:33] is thyself
[2:07:37] it's your own human cell
[2:07:39] that is keeping you from God but he's so
[2:07:42] night
[2:07:43] that you can touch him
[2:07:49] he's so lie that you can touch him he's
[2:07:52] real people
[2:07:54] it's not a god that is in space and we
[2:07:56] don't know where he is I declare this
[2:07:58] morning that he is here
[2:08:01] he's right here this morning
[2:08:04] [Applause]
[2:08:10] thank you
[2:08:14] see this woman
[2:08:16] let me jump ahead of myself a little bit
[2:08:18] because I'm going out of time see this
[2:08:21] woman that was saying we have no dealing
[2:08:24] when Jesus brought Beyond herself
[2:08:30] and he entered the room with her
[2:08:34] he brought Beyond ourselves and entered
[2:08:37] into the room with her and he sat down
[2:08:40] brother Adam said he he contacted her
[2:08:43] spirit he sat down and started to tell
[2:08:46] her you have four or five husbands the
[2:08:49] more you had an iron the woman I was
[2:08:51] saying we don't have no dealing she's
[2:08:54] not inviting instead of come and see
[2:08:55] this man why are you bringing the people
[2:08:58] to the man that you have not dealing
[2:09:00] with
[2:09:06] for the Samaritans to receive him when
[2:09:09] she knows that the Samaritan don't have
[2:09:11] dealing with him
[2:09:15] but what did she said he told me
[2:09:19] he told me
[2:09:23] oh that I have done oh
[2:09:28] that's why you need you need God to
[2:09:30] enter your room
[2:09:31] you need him to enter the chamber with
[2:09:34] you
[2:09:46] oh praise the Lord
[2:09:48] Hallelujah
[2:10:01] the next time
[2:10:03] you will ever get the thought of feeling
[2:10:06] that we ever cross your mind if ever if
[2:10:09] if ever endeavor
[2:10:12] we ever bring a thought across your mind
[2:10:16] that says we are not the same
[2:10:19] we don't have no dealing
[2:10:21] that's a devil language
[2:10:24] that's a demonic language of one blood
[2:10:29] we try to use religion they are Muslims
[2:10:32] we are Christians we try to use our our
[2:10:35] racism we try to use tribalism all sorts
[2:10:39] of things
[2:10:41] and yet it had never solved our
[2:10:44] differences
[2:10:45] we say they are now of the same family
[2:10:47] this is our family that is there but we
[2:10:50] still get probably in our family
[2:10:53] we try to separate everybody from what
[2:10:55] we have not solved our problem yet
[2:10:58] we said this is our our
[2:11:05] amen so yes the problem is not
[2:11:08] differences of whom it's not differences
[2:11:11] of location it's a blood problem
[2:11:14] the prophet of God said we need a blood
[2:11:16] transfusion
[2:11:17] and I'm telling you I'm ready to give it
[2:11:20] this morning I'm ready to give a blood
[2:11:23] transfusion this morning that's why we
[2:11:26] need a blood transfusion
[2:11:39] how can people expect you to go in a
[2:11:42] rapture their mind is so breading and
[2:11:45] crafted in this way
[2:11:51] we are denying ourselves of our own body
[2:11:53] the change the things that are supposed
[2:11:56] to bring us overcoming power
[2:12:04] if you don't have that I'm telling you
[2:12:06] there is nothing that will satisfy you
[2:12:08] they can put you in the house and give
[2:12:11] you all the money in the world you will
[2:12:13] never be satisfied you will sit right
[2:12:16] there with those wealth and you will be
[2:12:18] crafting evil
[2:12:21] you will be sitting down with the wealth
[2:12:23] of the word and say you will be crafting
[2:12:25] evil
[2:12:29] so money that's not it's not a problem
[2:12:48] praise the Lord
[2:12:55] the facilities that we have
[2:12:59] we can stream service online
[2:13:01] we can listen to it we can put it on our
[2:13:03] phone and what all that we can
[2:13:07] but yet
[2:13:08] we are still far from God
[2:13:12] we are still far from God
[2:13:17] we are still far from God
[2:13:20] I challenge you
[2:13:22] try it
[2:13:25] you streaming into a service
[2:13:28] the purpose is to enjoy the word and
[2:13:30] fellowship but pretty soon you start
[2:13:32] criticizing
[2:13:34] you are just looking at the saving and
[2:13:35] criticizing see that other one there
[2:13:39] I don't like the way they can sink
[2:13:41] now what is the benefit of you streaming
[2:13:45] what is the benefit when other people
[2:13:47] are in the house of God they are giving
[2:13:49] praise to God you that is on this on the
[2:13:52] line sitting down then you are
[2:13:54] criticizing them
[2:14:00] [Music]
[2:14:08] we come to the house of God
[2:14:10] this place is called the house of God
[2:14:12] that's the name we give it
[2:14:16] praise the Lord
[2:14:17] and the one we come to is almighty God
[2:14:21] we must be entering into his presence
[2:14:24] we must be entering
[2:14:27] praise the Lord
[2:14:32] we must be glory beyond our sitting
[2:14:36] position
[2:14:40] just like the scripture says and John
[2:14:42] was in the spirit on the last day
[2:14:49] Hallelujah
[2:14:52] thank you but then that's kind of you
[2:14:58] are we together
[2:15:09] when we come back we just sit back
[2:15:14] so easy for us to be overtaken by sleep
[2:15:17] in the presence of God
[2:15:21] so easy to be overtaken by sleep
[2:15:28] oh yeah sleep will come
[2:15:30] but you have to know why you are here
[2:15:32] and if you really know why you are here
[2:15:34] you will fight against it you will stand
[2:15:36] up you will go outside you say no devil
[2:15:39] I'm here to worship God I must receive
[2:15:41] from the word of God you don't sit there
[2:15:42] and just love me you'll see that
[2:16:06] we have a generation conflict something
[2:16:09] that have built
[2:16:12] it have built complex
[2:16:15] complex in US
[2:16:17] complex
[2:16:20] until for no reason we go around
[2:16:24] misjudging
[2:16:27] the action of people
[2:16:29] why is she looking at me like that
[2:16:32] who she thinks she is when you don't
[2:16:34] even know what is on her mind right
[2:16:43] blacks
[2:16:44] being people
[2:16:46] that we can never find anything to make
[2:16:48] us happy
[2:16:50] no matter how much we have we are just
[2:16:52] angry our face are found
[2:16:57] when God's people
[2:16:59] ought to be happy people
[2:17:02] the preacher have to beg you for an amen
[2:17:04] before you say Amen
[2:17:07] amen say amen amen say amen amen
[2:17:15] complex
[2:17:18] and we feed on it we feed every day we
[2:17:22] go and look for element
[2:17:25] to make us more difficult
[2:17:29] we go and gather elements to make us
[2:17:31] more difficult
[2:17:37] then you say Lord Jesus come he's been
[2:17:39] here ever since he's here

[2:17:52] God knew where Adam was it was Adam that
[2:17:55] never knew where he was
[2:17:59] I never knew where he was but God knew
[2:18:03] exactly where he was
[2:18:08] and if God should ask you to see him
[2:18:10] this morning where are you

[2:19:32] almost one Teddy yeah she let you go
[2:19:35] I'm not even according to my notes here
[2:19:37] but that's okay
[2:19:39] that's a good way to start
[2:19:52] the Jews
[2:19:53] have no dealing
[2:19:56] that's what she said
[2:20:01] and remember that this very woman that
[2:20:04] was bringing segregation
[2:20:06] she knew what the prophet said
[2:20:09] she knew that the prophet said the
[2:20:11] Messiah will come
[2:20:14] she was able to identify that you you
[2:20:16] are a prophet
[2:20:18] so she was religious
[2:20:22] praise the Lord amen
[2:20:25] she was religious she she had knowledge
[2:20:27] of the word but yes she was bound in the
[2:20:30] life of teaching one man to another
[2:20:35] praise the Lord
[2:20:37] why because she had this problem this
[2:20:41] Blood problem
[2:20:44] something has settled down in her blood
[2:20:47] cells
[2:20:48] that make her to think that she's better
[2:20:50] than another person
[2:20:54] that's the worst curse that a man can
[2:20:57] ever cling to himself
[2:21:01] for you to think or feel that you are
[2:21:03] better than another person
[2:21:16] may God be merciful
[2:21:18] may God give us Grace
[2:21:23] that we can be able to identify
[2:21:30] the generation conflict
[2:21:35] praise the Lord
[2:21:37] and we can be able to identify the
[2:21:39] generation conflict let me read
[2:21:41] something here to you then I'll let you
[2:21:43] go
[2:21:46] some will see Jesus and when she comes
[2:21:48] to the world Jesus said woman
[2:21:50] bring me a drink and she said why it's
[2:21:53] not customary for you Jews to ask
[2:21:56] Samaritans such we have no dealing
[2:21:59] one another in another word It Was a
[2:22:03] Race effect
[2:22:04] like between the color red and white
[2:22:07] today why see why we have no dealing
[2:22:10] with one another
[2:22:12] praise the Lord
[2:22:16] this is where I want to get you Dr Moses
[2:22:19] you know what
[2:22:21] I begin to Believe Christian French
[2:22:24] that we are just living in the beginning
[2:22:26] of the greatest time this word
[2:22:31] has ever witnessed
[2:22:34] the statistics
[2:22:37] the statistics
[2:22:39] are mind-blowing
[2:22:43] mind-blowing
[2:22:46] the statistics is that
[2:22:48] there have never been a time
[2:22:52] they have never been a time in the world
[2:22:56] the world has had genocides
[2:23:02] the destruction of life
[2:23:06] on the ground of
[2:23:08] human differences
[2:23:12] praise the Lord
[2:23:15] when the Roman Empire fought
[2:23:18] it was not because they felt that they
[2:23:20] were better than those people they
[2:23:21] wanted LED they wanted to conquer
[2:23:24] they were looking for people to to
[2:23:25] conquer
[2:23:27] praise the Lord
[2:23:29] Joshua and his manly fought for their
[2:23:31] inheritance
[2:23:34] but they have never been a time the
[2:23:37] statistics that is out there
[2:23:39] this 20th century
[2:23:43] has been able to experience More Death
[2:23:46] killing
[2:23:49] only on the ground
[2:23:51] of differences
[2:23:55] praise the Lord
[2:23:58] in Rwanda the genocide it was just
[2:24:00] ethnic differences
[2:24:04] people of the sea nation speak the same
[2:24:06] language
[2:24:10] but because of trouble differences
[2:24:14] they took the life of one another
[2:24:17] that's what this 20th century has
[2:24:20] experienced
[2:24:30] there has never been a time in the word
[2:24:33] where the world has a spirit's
[2:24:35] information
[2:24:37] then our age
[2:24:40] information
[2:24:44] praise the Lord
[2:24:46] Hallelujah
[2:24:51] never be the time
[2:24:53] I mean if if it is recorded if it is
[2:24:57] recalled
[2:25:00] if there is a written document
[2:25:03] we can get it
[2:25:05] we can get it well if we have to hack it
[2:25:08] we can get it this generation if there
[2:25:12] is a written document
[2:25:15] if we have to hack it we can get it
[2:25:20] if it's on video we can get it
[2:25:23] praise the Lord

[2:25:29] King Charles on his bed
[2:25:32] they will show you a video of King
[2:25:34] Charles on his bed this generation
[2:25:37] there are never been a time where we
[2:25:39] have we have access to information
[2:25:44] we have access to information
[2:25:54] we are living in the beginning of the
[2:25:56] greatest time
[2:25:57] that the word has ever witnessed
[2:26:01] I just believe that all of the lines are
[2:26:06] getting on clock
[2:26:09] all of the lines are getting on clock
[2:26:13] there are things
[2:26:15] that people used to do lawmakers used to
[2:26:18] do they would get by with it now they
[2:26:20] can
[2:26:22] now they can
[2:26:24] praise the Lord
[2:26:29] there was one Deputy somewhere there I
[2:26:31] just I just saw that on the news field
[2:26:33] they were right in the office they were
[2:26:35] talking about you know another person
[2:26:37] name you know trying to uh uh nothing
[2:26:40] she can do we're going we're going to
[2:26:41] stronghold we got this this is it was
[2:26:43] recorded they listened to their own
[2:26:45] voices
[2:26:54] and I can also tell you
[2:26:57] the channel to your soul
[2:27:00] can also be on clock
[2:27:03] praise the Lord the channel to your soul
[2:27:07] that you don't have to rely on religion
[2:27:09] or your denomination you can get access
[2:27:12] to a living God
[2:27:19] because all the lines
[2:27:22] [Music]
[2:27:29] You Don't Have To Praise In Yourself
[2:27:33] there is more of God
[2:27:36] than what you know
[2:27:41] right
[2:27:45] all the lines are getting on clock you
[2:27:48] know clock up with all kinds of
[2:27:50] doctrines and geologies and all kinds of
[2:27:53] stuff unbelief is being hindered down
[2:27:57] generation conflict hanging down from
[2:28:00] one generation to another
[2:28:04] and we have a goal wrong with this thing
[2:28:08] hand it down
[2:28:12] no matter this I'm Lutheran
[2:28:15] I'm Baptist
[2:28:18] when God is looking for people that will
[2:28:20] turn the world upside down
[2:28:23] he's not looking for one denomination or
[2:28:25] another
[2:28:27] praise the Lord
[2:28:30] the names that we have had on talk how
[2:28:32] much have it benefited us
[2:28:37] all kinds of stuff has been handed down
[2:28:39] from one generation to another oh
[2:28:41] there's no such a thing as healing that
[2:28:44] there is a miracle this past who told
[2:28:46] you that
[2:28:48] Is God dead
[2:28:50] is he not the same yesterday today and
[2:28:52] forever
[2:29:01] he says and we just automatically
[2:29:04] believe it
[2:29:08] it's fair to us and we just believe it
[2:29:10] we just embrace it
[2:29:15] Hallelujah we just automatically believe
[2:29:17] it
[2:29:20] say yeah I mean all the church today
[2:29:22] that I mean the churches they are just
[2:29:24] fake
[2:29:29] are we together
[2:29:32] but
[2:29:34] they come to a place where God not man
[2:29:36] would they still be back there in the
[2:29:40] old former way look how science has
[2:29:42] progressed in the past
[2:29:44] 150 years think of it a hundred years
[2:29:47] ago the only way they had to send
[2:29:50] message was by a letter
[2:29:53] foreign
[2:29:57] praise the Lord
[2:29:58] just just couple of years back yes
[2:30:00] couple of years back I mean I'm not old
[2:30:04] we used to travel
[2:30:06] and sometimes when you're traveling in
[2:30:07] in the interior the people come to the
[2:30:10] bus station they give you a letter
[2:30:12] they just tell you the town
[2:30:14] they give you the letter that says when
[2:30:16] you get to this town
[2:30:18] just throw it
[2:30:21] they put the name of the person on it
[2:30:24] so you are in a vehicle
[2:30:27] I remember I remember traveling and you
[2:30:29] know the people gave you letter when you
[2:30:31] get to this town just try it and you
[2:30:34] throw it you see somebody coming to pick

[2:30:40] take it to Joseph house
[2:30:46] oh yeah
[2:30:48] they can be picky or they look ahead
[2:30:50] it's Joseph as soon as they find a
[2:30:52] person named then they wave to you
[2:31:02] 100 years the only way we had to send
[2:31:05] message was by letter all by left to ear
[2:31:08] when you get there please tell them and
[2:31:10] there you carry the message and then you
[2:31:12] make it you make he really told me say I

[2:32:06] how they progress
[2:32:11] amen
[2:32:12] how they have progressed
[2:32:16] I'm going to stop here
[2:32:27] we are not got into our subject yet but
[2:32:29] that's fine
[2:32:36] generation conflict
[2:32:45] science has beat us
[2:32:48] science has picked it up
[2:32:50] they have picked it up
[2:32:53] they have picked it up
[2:32:57] ancestry.com people now tracing the
[2:33:00] ancestors
[2:33:03] how do they do it
[2:33:08] how do they do it
[2:33:13] through your DNA
[2:33:19] it's through your DNA
[2:33:21] there's a language
[2:33:23] that is in you
[2:33:26] praise the Lord
[2:33:28] it's the reason why
[2:33:30] God don't need to speak English
[2:33:33] or French or German for him to speak to
[2:33:36] your soul
[2:33:51] praise the Lord
[2:33:53] the doctors will tell you and when and
[2:33:56] we experienced that a couple of times
[2:33:58] now they will tell you when someone is
[2:34:01] in common or just looking at a
[2:34:03] documentary home a couple of days and
[2:34:05] wife and myself and this this boy is a
[2:34:09] true life story how to had an accident
[2:34:11] very terrible accident
[2:34:13] and uh in uh just just in that uh uh
[2:34:20] their car got submerged in the water
[2:34:24] and he stayed in the water for about 30
[2:34:27] minutes
[2:34:28] or more
[2:34:30] and he came to pull him out and take him
[2:34:32] to the hospital
[2:34:36] but I just did everything that he could
[2:34:38] the first thing they ran for information
[2:34:40] to his brain
[2:34:42] and they were having no signal
[2:34:44] and they told his mama
[2:34:48] that we're not getting any communication
[2:34:50] with his brain
[2:34:53] foreign
[2:35:09] she said can I go in and see my boy
[2:35:12] the doctor said yes
[2:35:15] she went by him
[2:35:19] and she held his hands
[2:35:22] started to call his name
[2:35:24] Junior
[2:35:25] this is Mama
[2:35:29] signs
[2:35:31] proof
[2:35:34] it's a proof of the Resurrection
[2:35:37] that when you come out of the Grave it's
[2:35:40] a familiar voice that you were here
[2:35:45] when Jesus said Lazarus come forth that
[2:35:49] voice was a familiar voice
[2:35:56] he started to call his name
[2:35:59] as she rubbed his hands
[2:36:02] praise the Lord
[2:36:05] sister comfort
[2:36:07] ing
[2:36:10] now I mean had an accident now uh and it
[2:36:13] flew over to Rochester
[2:36:16] and Iceberg then and his wife to go and
[2:36:18] find places and my wife and myself went
[2:36:20] there and were visiting with her
[2:36:22] I mean she pretty much broke every bone
[2:36:24] in her body
[2:36:26] your own life support the doctors were
[2:36:29] doing everything they were all they were
[2:36:30] there that's not being the why back now
[2:36:32] but she's she's well now
[2:36:36] and if I just were doing everything they
[2:36:38] couldn't get no communication with the
[2:36:40] brain
[2:36:40] we got there in the bed
[2:36:45] Aaron took her hand and says Naomi this
[2:36:47] is Ari
[2:36:50] Naomi this is Irene
[2:36:56] and after 10 minutes or a little bit
[2:36:58] than that she started keep doing that
[2:37:00] Naomi this is Aaron are you hearing me
[2:37:05] she started moving her head
[2:37:13] that's the reason why Medical Science
[2:37:15] were wrong the nearest Kings they were
[2:37:19] one the closest person somebody that is
[2:37:22] familiar a mother a sister somebody that
[2:37:24] is close they don't want a stranger
[2:37:26] because my sheep yeah my boys
[2:37:28] [Music]
[2:37:32] [Applause]
[2:37:44] praise the Lord
[2:37:52] generation conflict
[2:37:53] like I've always said one of these days
[2:37:55] you will realize all of the things that
[2:37:57] we have fought over
[2:38:00] and we talk and make us better you get
[2:38:02] to heaven you'll be so disappointed
[2:38:05] that none of those things matter to God
[2:38:10] none of those things matter to God
[2:38:25] the musicians can come
[2:38:30] sorry for keeping you a little bit late
[2:38:42] generation conflict
[2:38:49] foreign
[2:39:12] that's when they start identifying the
[2:39:14] voice of their parents
[2:39:18] a couple of years ago I can't remember
[2:39:21] now but right here in Brooklyn uh uh
[2:39:24] Senator I went I went down to one shop
[2:39:28] I remember and I said we were looking at
[2:39:29] uh what just looking doing some shopping
[2:39:32] trying to get some painting and we met
[2:39:35] this Korean woman and she was telling us
[2:39:36] how
[2:39:37] her little nephew
[2:39:40] got to speak in English
[2:39:42] because the mother will always read an
[2:39:45] English book to her
[2:39:47] when she was pregnant
[2:39:50] she would take a book
[2:39:53] in the evening and read it to her baby
[2:39:58] and when the child was born
[2:40:01] the child would catch the language
[2:40:07] familiar voice
[2:40:10] praise the Lord
[2:40:13] don't make the voice of God a stranger
[2:40:15] to you
[2:40:17] the voice of God
[2:40:19] have to be familiar
[2:40:22] praise the Lord
[2:40:24] and how do the voice of God gets
[2:40:26] familiar when that stay a small voice
[2:40:29] speak to you when nobody is around
[2:40:33] all right
[2:40:35] and you can say yes Lord
[2:40:37] Lord I'm sorry
[2:40:41] Lord thank you for speaking to me
[2:40:46] and the more you make the voice of God
[2:40:48] we're coming the more you create an
[2:40:51] atmosphere for the voice of God
[2:40:54] to become
[2:40:56] familiar to you
[2:41:01] little Samir he had to learn the voice
[2:41:04] of God
[2:41:06] Eli told him the next time you hear that
[2:41:09] voice says speak my lord your seven
[2:41:11] years
[2:41:13] right around and the prophet of God had
[2:41:15] to learn that voice
[2:41:18] until he knew when God spoke he took his
[2:41:21] heart
[2:41:23] he said Lord is there something you want
[2:41:25] to tell yourself
[2:41:27] and you can know the voice of God also
[2:41:32] [Music]
[2:41:40] [Music]
[2:41:42] it would take the voice of God
[2:41:44] to bring you out of your generation
[2:41:47] conflict
[2:41:49] it will not take your own human
[2:41:51] calculation
[2:41:52] all your religious practice
[2:41:55] the same way he took the voice of God to
[2:41:58] bring Lazarus out of the grave it would
[2:42:00] take the voice of God to bring you out
[2:42:03] of every complex that you are dealing
[2:42:05] with in your mind every complex
[2:42:08] every bitterness every darkness that is
[2:42:12] in your spirit it will take the voice of
[2:42:14] God
[2:42:15] and if you don't make your if you don't
[2:42:16] make the voice of God familiar to you is
[2:42:19] how long you will stay in your prison
[2:42:25] [Music]
[2:42:28] from God one word
[2:42:30] [Music]
[2:42:35] and we will hold to face and we will
[2:42:38] hold to to feel anything and we will
[2:42:41] hold things down in our spirit
