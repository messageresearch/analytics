[6:45] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[6:46] the churches to him that overcometh will
[6:49] i give to eat of the hidden manna and i
[6:52] will give him a white stone
[6:53] and in this stone a new name written
[6:56] which no man knoweth saving he that
[6:58] receiveth it
[7:00] each message to each age holds out an
[7:02] incentive to the believer encouraging
[7:04] him to be an overcomer and thereby be
[7:06] rewarded of the lord
[7:08] in this age the spirit is promising the
[7:10] hidden manna and a new name written in a
[7:13] white stone
[7:15] now since each of these messages is
[7:16] directed to the angel human messenger a
[7:20] very great responsibility as well as a
[7:21] wonderful privilege is his lot to these
[7:24] men god makes special promises as in the
[7:27] case of the twelve apostles sitting on
[7:29] twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes
[7:30] of israel
[7:32] then remember paul was given a special
[7:34] promise
[7:35] that of presenting the people of the
[7:37] bride in his day to jesus
[7:39] second corinthians 11 2
[7:42] for i am jealous over you with a godly
[7:44] jealousy for i have espoused you to one
[7:46] husband that i may present you as a
[7:48] chaste virgin to christ
[7:51] so it will be with every messenger who
[7:53] has been faithful to the word of his
[7:54] hour and his age
[7:56] it will be so in the last day
[7:58] it will be the same special reward that
[8:00] was given to paul
[8:02] i think most of you remember how i said
[8:04] i had always been afraid to die lest i
[8:06] should meet the lord and he should not
[8:08] be pleased with me as i had failed him
[8:09] so many times well i had been thinking
[8:12] of that one morning as i lay in bed
[8:15] and suddenly i was caught up in a most
[8:16] peculiar vision
[8:18] i say it was peculiar for i have had
[8:20] thousands of visions and not once did i
[8:22] seem to leave my body
[8:24] but there i was caught up
[8:26] and i looked back to see my wife and i
[8:28] saw my body lying there beside her
[8:31] then i found myself in the most
[8:32] beautiful place i have ever seen
[8:35] it was a paradise
[8:37] i saw throngs of the most beautiful and
[8:39] happiest people i have ever seen
[8:41] they all looked so young
[8:43] about 18 to 21 years of age
[8:46] there was not a gray hair or a wrinkle
[8:48] or any deformity amongst them the young
[8:50] women all had hair down to their waists
[8:53] and the young men were so handsome and
[8:54] strong
[8:56] oh how they welcomed me
[8:58] they hugged me and called me their
[8:59] darling brother and kept telling me how
[9:01] glad they were to see me
[9:03] as i wondered who all those folks were
[9:06] one beside me said they are your people
[9:10] i was so astonished i asked
[9:12] are all these branhams
[9:14] he said
[9:15] no they are your converts
[9:17] he then pointed to one lady and said
[9:19] see that young lady that you were
[9:21] admiring a moment ago
[9:22] she was 90 years old when you won her to
[9:25] the lord
[9:26] i said
[9:27] oh my and to think this is what i was
[9:29] afraid of
[9:30] the man said
[9:32] we are resting here while waiting for
[9:34] the coming of the lord i replied i want
[9:37] to see him
[9:38] he said
[9:39] you can't see him just yet
[9:41] but he is coming soon
[9:43] and when he does he will come to you
[9:45] first and you will be judged according
[9:47] to the gospel you have preached and we
[9:49] will be your subjects
[9:51] i said
[9:52] do you mean i am responsible for all
[9:54] these
[9:55] he said
[9:56] everyone
[9:57] you were born a leader
[9:59] i asked him
[10:01] will everyone be responsible
[10:03] what about saint paul
[10:05] he answered me
[10:06] he will be responsible for his day
[10:09] well i said
[10:10] i've preached the same gospel that paul
[10:12] preached
[10:13] and the multitude cried
[10:15] we're resting on that yes i can see that
[10:18] god is going to give a special reward to
[10:20] his messengers who have faithfully
[10:22] discharged the responsibility he has
[10:24] placed upon them
[10:25] if they have received the revelation of
[10:27] the word for that age and faithfully
[10:29] preached in their day and lived what
[10:31] they preached they will receive a great
[10:34] reward
[10:36] now with this thought in mind look at
[10:37] the verse again
[10:39] i will give him the hidden manna
[10:41] we all know that the manna was angel
[10:43] food
[10:44] it was what god sent down upon the grass
[10:46] for israel at the time of their
[10:48] wanderings it was perfect food
[10:51] it was amazing how those little pellets
[10:52] of food kept them in perfect health no
[10:55] one got sick it was all they needed
[10:58] when the ark was made they put some of
[11:00] that manna into it
[11:01] then the ark was put behind the veil and
[11:04] only the high priest would dare approach
[11:06] unto it and then he had to have the
[11:07] sacrificial blood
[11:09] the bread from heaven symbolized by
[11:11] manna one day came down from heaven and
[11:13] became life for all who believe on him
[11:16] he said
[11:18] i am the bread of life
[11:19] i am the living bread that came down
[11:21] from heaven if any man shall eat of this
[11:23] bread he shall live forever
[11:26] when he went away he left us his word
[11:29] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[11:32] every word that proceeds out of the
[11:33] mouth of god
[11:35] his word was bread
[11:37] it was the perfect manna which if a man
[11:40] live by he shall never die
[11:42] but right after the death of the fathers
[11:44] no one seemed to know the exact truth
[11:46] and in a short while this manner seemed
[11:48] to have become hidden to the people
[11:51] but in every age god began to give back
[11:54] by revelation that which was hidden
[11:56] until in this last day according to
[11:58] revelation 10 7
[12:00] a prophet will come and reveal all the
[12:03] mysteries and then the lord will come
[12:05] now in each age i say the messengers
[12:08] received hidden truth
[12:10] but they did not receive it for
[12:11] themselves only
[12:14] but it is as it was when the disciples
[12:16] were asked to serve the multitudes
[12:17] loaves and fishes jesus gave them the
[12:20] broken food but they in turn gave it to
[12:22] the people god gives his hidden manner
[12:25] to the overcomer it cannot be otherwise
[12:28] he would not open his treasures to those
[12:30] who spurn what is already revealed
[12:33] what i have been saying about the
[12:34] messenger of each age receiving from god
[12:36] some of the original truth of pentecost
[12:39] is typed out in the old testament where
[12:41] moses was commanded to take up three and
[12:43] one-half pints of manna and place it in
[12:46] a golden vessel behind the veil of the
[12:47] holy of holies
[12:49] there the high priest of every
[12:50] generation could enter with sacrificial
[12:52] blood
[12:54] then he could take a small portion of
[12:55] this manna for it did not corrupt
[12:58] which was part of the original and eat
[13:00] it
[13:01] now in every age the messenger of the
[13:03] lord to that age was given the
[13:04] revelation of god for that specific
[13:06] period
[13:08] once the messenger was enlightened by
[13:09] truth he would bring that truth to the
[13:12] people
[13:13] and they whose ears had been opened by
[13:15] the spirit would hear that truth believe
[13:17] it and live it
[13:19] now then there is also the thought of
[13:21] the future partaking of the hidden manna
[13:23] i think it will be the eternal partaking
[13:25] of the revelation of jesus christ in the
[13:27] eternal ages to come
[13:29] how else could we begin to know the
[13:31] unsearchable riches of his own being all
[13:34] that we have long to know
[13:36] all our unanswered questions all that
[13:38] will be revealed
[13:39] it will be from christ who is our life
[13:41] that we receive it
[13:43] oh sometimes we think we get to know a
[13:45] little of him and his word down here and
[13:47] it is so good it makes us rejoice
[13:50] but one day when our flesh changes that
[13:52] word and he will become what we had
[13:54] never dreamed possible
[13:56] it also says here that he is going to
[13:58] give the overcomer a white stone and in
[14:01] not on the stone a new name which the
[14:04] owner alone knows
[14:06] now the idea of a new name is a familiar
[14:08] one
[14:09] abram was changed to abraham sarah to
[14:12] sarah jacob to israel simon to peter and
[14:15] saul to paul
[14:17] these names either brought about a
[14:18] change or were given because of a change
[14:21] it was only after abraham manceriae had
[14:23] their names changed by the lord
[14:25] but they were made ready to receive the
[14:27] coming son
[14:28] in jacob's case he had to overcome and
[14:31] then he was called a prince
[14:33] in the case of simon and saul when they
[14:36] had received the lord their change came
[14:38] and today each one of us true believers
[14:41] has had a change in name
[14:42] we are christians
[14:44] it is a name common to all of us
[14:47] but one day we will have another change
[14:49] we will of a certainty receive a new
[14:51] name
[14:52] it could well be that name was our true
[14:54] and original name written in the lamb's
[14:56] book of life from the foundation of the
[14:58] world
[14:59] he knows the name but we do not
[15:02] one day at his good pleasure we will
[15:04] know also
[15:06] a white stone
[15:08] how beautiful
[15:09] here is another picture of this saint
[15:11] receiving recompense from the hand of
[15:13] god for his trials upon earth
[15:15] you know after constantine the false
[15:17] church was able to dip its hand in the
[15:19] state treasury and thereby erect
[15:21] beautiful buildings full of lovely
[15:23] statuary
[15:24] these statues made of white marble were
[15:26] actually roman idols renamed as saints
[15:30] the churches and their furnishings were
[15:31] exceptionally beautiful even as one sees
[15:34] today
[15:35] but god was not with them
[15:37] where was god
[15:39] he was with his saints in some little
[15:40] home or in a cave or some wild mountain
[15:43] area where they hid from the false
[15:44] church members
[15:46] they did not have beautiful buildings
[15:48] gowned choirs fine clothes and other
[15:50] worldly attractions
[15:52] but now in this special promise to the
[15:54] true believers of all ages
[15:56] god has declared he will give them
[15:58] rewards of great beauty and eternal
[16:00] duration
[16:01] let the wealthy look down on the poor
[16:04] let them give large sums to the church
[16:06] that it in turn might honor the donor by
[16:08] placing a marble plaque or some statuary
[16:10] in their honor on public display that
[16:12] all may applaud
[16:14] someday the god who sees and knows all
[16:17] will once more commend the widow for
[16:19] giving her all though it be but two
[16:21] mites
[16:22] and he himself reward with the treasures
[16:24] of heaven
[16:26] yes hidden manna and a new name in a
[16:28] white stone
[16:29] how good is the lord to us to reward us
[16:31] so wonderfully and we so undeserving
[16:34] oh i want to be ready at all times to do
[16:37] his will and to lay up treasures in
[16:39] heaven
[16:42] chapter 6
[16:43] the thiatarian church age
[16:46] revelation 2
[16:47] 18-29
[16:50] and unto the angel of the church in
[16:52] thyatira write
[16:54] these things saith the son of god who
[16:56] hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire
[16:58] and his feet are like fine brass
[17:01] i know thy works and charity and service
[17:03] and faith and thy patience and thy works
[17:07] and the last to be more than the first
[17:10] notwithstanding i have a few things
[17:12] against thee because thou sufferest that
[17:14] woman jezebel which calleth herself a
[17:16] prophetess to teach and to seduce my
[17:19] servants to commit fornication and to
[17:21] eat things sacrificed unto idols
[17:23] and i gave her space to repent of her
[17:25] fornication and she repented not
[17:28] behold i will cast her into a bed and
[17:30] them that commit adultery with her into
[17:32] great tribulation except they repent of
[17:35] their deeds
[17:36] and i will kill her children with death
[17:39] and all the churches shall know that i
[17:41] am he which searcheth the rains and
[17:43] hearts
[17:44] and i will give unto every one of you
[17:46] according to your works
[17:48] but unto you i say and unto the rest in
[17:50] thyatira as many as have not this
[17:52] doctrine and which have not known the
[17:54] depths of satan as they speak
[17:56] i will put upon you none other burden
[17:59] but that which ye have already hold fast
[18:01] till i come
[18:03] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[18:05] works unto the end to him will i give
[18:07] power over the nations
[18:09] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[18:11] iron as the vessels of a potter shall
[18:13] they be broken to shivers
[18:14] even as i received of my father
[18:17] and i will give him the morning star
[18:20] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[18:22] the spirit saith unto the churches
[18:27] thyatira
[18:29] historically the city of thyatira was
[18:31] the least noteworthy of all the seven
[18:33] cities of the revelation
[18:35] it was situated on the confines of misha
[18:37] and ionia
[18:38] it was surrounded by many rivers but
[18:40] they were full of leeches
[18:42] its most commendable feature was that it
[18:44] was well off financially due to the
[18:46] corporate guilds of potter's tanners
[18:48] weavers dyers road makers etc
[18:51] it was from this city that lydia the
[18:53] seller of purple came
[18:55] she was paul's first european convert
[18:59] now the reason that the spirit chose
[19:01] this city as the one already containing
[19:03] the spiritual elements for the fourth
[19:05] age was because of its religion
[19:07] the major religion of thyatira was the
[19:10] worship of apollo taramnaos
[19:12] which was joined with the emperor
[19:14] worship cult
[19:15] apollo was the sun god and the next in
[19:17] power to his father zeus
[19:19] he was known as the averter of evil
[19:22] he presided over religious law and
[19:24] expiation means of atonement making
[19:26] amends for wrongdoing or guilt
[19:29] plato said of him
[19:31] he explains to men the institution of
[19:33] temples sacrifices and services to
[19:35] deities
[19:36] besides rights connected with death and
[19:38] after life
[19:40] he communicated his knowledge of the
[19:42] future and his father's will to man
[19:45] through the prophets and oracles
[19:47] in thyatira this ritual was conducted by
[19:49] a prophetess who sat on a tripod chair
[19:51] and delivered the messages while
[19:53] entranced
[19:55] the hold of this religion was remarkable
[19:57] its formidable power did not lie
[19:59] exclusively in the realm of mystery but
[20:01] lay in the fact no one could belong to
[20:03] the guilds which offered the people
[20:05] they're living unless they belong to the
[20:07] temple worship of apollo
[20:09] anyone who refused to join in the
[20:11] idolatrous feasts and licentious orgies
[20:14] was barred from these first century
[20:15] unions
[20:17] in order to be a part of the social and
[20:18] commercial life one had to be a
[20:20] practicing pagan idolater
[20:23] it is most worthy of note that the very
[20:25] name thyatira means dominating female
[20:29] thus this age is characterized by a
[20:31] dominant force a force that ruthlessly
[20:34] invades all
[20:35] conquers all and despotically controls
[20:38] now a dominating female is the greatest
[20:40] curse in the world
[20:41] the wisest man the world ever saw was
[20:44] solomon and he said
[20:46] i applied my heart to know and to search
[20:48] and to seek out wisdom
[20:50] and the reason of things and to know the
[20:52] wickedness of folly even a foolishness
[20:55] and madness
[20:56] and i find more bitter than death the
[20:58] woman whose heart is snares and nets and
[21:01] her hands as bands
[21:03] who so pleaseth god shall escape from
[21:05] her but the sinner shall be taken by her
[21:09] behold this i have found saith the
[21:11] preacher counting one by one to find out
[21:13] the account which yet my soul seeketh
[21:15] but i find not
[21:17] one man amongst a thousand have i found
[21:20] but a woman among all those have i not
[21:23] found
[21:24] ecclesiastes 7
[21:26] 25-28
[21:28] paul said
[21:29] i suffer not a woman to teach or to
[21:31] usurp authority
[21:34] from the garden of eden onward woman has
[21:36] constantly and successfully tried to
[21:37] take control over the man
[21:39] and right today it is a woman's world
[21:41] with the goddess of america being a
[21:43] naked female
[21:45] as the female idol falling out of the
[21:47] skies remember her arms were iron bars
[21:50] characterized the first or ephesian age
[21:52] so her power has grown until she has
[21:54] gained absolute authority such authority
[21:57] being usurped by her iron disposition
[22:01] now a woman is not meant to have an iron
[22:03] disposition
[22:04] she is according to the holy scripture
[22:06] to be submissive to the male
[22:09] that is commanded of her
[22:11] woman who is truly female all female
[22:13] will be of that disposition not a
[22:15] doormat
[22:16] no real male makes a female a doormat
[22:20] but she will want to be under authority
[22:22] and not rule over the mail for he is the
[22:24] head of the house if she breaks that
[22:27] image that god made for her she is
[22:28] perverted
[22:30] any male that lets the woman take
[22:31] authority has also broken that image and
[22:33] he is perverted
[22:35] that is why a woman cannot wear that
[22:37] which pertaineth to a man or cut her
[22:39] hair
[22:40] she is never to wear garments that
[22:42] pertain to a male or cut her hair
[22:44] when she does
[22:46] she is intruding into the male domain
[22:48] taking authority and perverting herself
[22:50] and when a woman invades the pulpit
[22:52] which it is commanded she must not do
[22:56] she shows what spirit she is of
[22:58] being a dominating female is antichrist
[23:00] and the seeds of the roman catholic
[23:02] church are in her though she may deny
[23:04] this ever so vehemently
[23:06] but when it comes to the word
[23:09] let god be true and every man's word a
[23:11] lie
[23:12] amen
[23:14] let us go back to the beginning
[23:17] in the original physical creation as we
[23:18] know it today god made everything in
[23:21] pairs male and female there were two
[23:24] chickens rooster and hen
[23:26] there were two cattle the cow and the
[23:28] bull
[23:29] and right down the line
[23:31] but when it came to man there was only
[23:33] one they were not a pair
[23:35] adam had been made in the image of god
[23:38] he was a son of god
[23:40] as a son of god he could not be tempted
[23:42] and fall
[23:43] that would be impossible
[23:45] so god took a byproduct of man to cause
[23:47] the fall
[23:48] woman never stepped fresh from the hand
[23:50] of god as a true product of god
[23:53] she was produced from man
[23:55] and when god caused her to be brought
[23:57] forth from man she was vastly different
[23:59] from the other females he had created
[24:01] she was able to be seduced no other
[24:04] female in creation can be immoral
[24:07] but the human female may be touched at
[24:08] almost any time
[24:10] and that weakness in her allowed satan
[24:12] to seduce her by way of the serpent and
[24:15] has brought the woman to a very peculiar
[24:16] position before god and his word
[24:19] she is the type of all things vulgar
[24:22] foul and loathsome on the one hand
[24:24] and on the other hand she is the type of
[24:26] all things clean and beautiful and holy
[24:29] as the receptacle of the spirit and
[24:30] blessings of god
[24:33] on the one hand she is called the
[24:35] who is drunk with the wine of her
[24:36] fornications
[24:38] on the other she is called the bride of
[24:40] christ
[24:41] on one hand she is called mystery
[24:43] babylon the abomination before god and
[24:46] on the other hand she is called new
[24:48] jerusalem our mother
[24:50] on the one hand she is so foul and
[24:52] wicked and blue that she is summarily
[24:54] cast into the lake of fire as the only
[24:56] fit place for her
[24:58] and on the other hand she is exalted to
[25:00] heaven sharing the very throne of god as
[25:02] the only place befitting such a queen
[25:06] and in this dietary and church age she
[25:08] is a dominating female
[25:10] she is mystery babylon she is the great
[25:13] she is jezebel the false
[25:15] prophetess
[25:16] why
[25:17] because the true female is submissive to
[25:19] god christ is her head
[25:22] she has no word but his no thoughts but
[25:24] his no leadership but his
[25:27] but what about this church
[25:29] she has cast out the word destroyed the
[25:31] bibles and worthy essays of the godly
[25:34] she has slain those who would preach the
[25:36] truth
[25:37] she has taken over kings princes and
[25:39] nations
[25:40] controls armies and insists that she is
[25:42] the true body of christ
[25:44] and that her popes are the vicars of
[25:46] christ
[25:47] she is entirely seduced by the devil
[25:49] until she in turn has become the seducer
[25:51] of others
[25:53] she is the bride of satan and has
[25:54] produced his bastard child religions
[25:58] all through the dark ages she has
[26:00] dominated
[26:01] for over 900 years she plundered and
[26:03] destroyed
[26:05] she killed the arts destroyed the
[26:06] sciences produced nothing but death
[26:09] until the light of the truth was almost
[26:10] entirely gone and only the barest sliver
[26:13] of light remained
[26:15] the oil and the wine had almost ceased
[26:17] to flow
[26:19] but though she dominated the world
[26:20] kingdoms and demanded that all men find
[26:22] their citizenship in her
[26:24] there was a little group who belonged to
[26:26] god
[26:27] and their citizenship was in heaven and
[26:29] them she could not destroy
[26:31] god kept his little flock
[26:33] they could not be destroyed
[26:36] this church of rome was as heathen and
[26:38] wicked as queen aphalia who tried to
[26:40] destroy all the royal seed and almost
[26:42] succeeded
[26:43] but god preserved one
[26:46] and of him there came more of the
[26:47] faithful
[26:49] so god preserved a little flock in that
[26:51] long dark night and of their truth
[26:53] they're finally a rosa luther
[26:56] anyone who knows anything at all about
[26:58] the roman catholic church and its form
[27:00] of worship can tell why the city of
[27:02] thyatira was chosen by the spirit to
[27:04] represent the church in the dark ages
[27:07] there it is right before our eyes
[27:11] the age
[27:13] the thyatirian age lasted the longest of
[27:16] them all about 900 years from 606 to
[27:20] 1520
[27:23] the messenger
[27:25] the church had long been split into two
[27:27] groups western and eastern
[27:29] every now and then a reformer would
[27:31] arise in either or both divisions and
[27:33] for a while lead some segment of the
[27:35] church into a deeper relationship with
[27:37] god
[27:38] such a man in the west was francis of
[27:40] assisi
[27:42] truly successful for a time his work was
[27:44] finally put under by the hierarchy of
[27:46] rome
[27:47] peter waldo of lyon
[27:49] a merchant who renounced his secular
[27:50] life became very active in serving the
[27:53] lord and drew many unto him
[27:55] but he was thwarted in his work and
[27:57] excommunicated by the pope
[27:59] neither the western or the eastern
[28:01] groups had within them a man who could
[28:03] possibly be the messenger to this age
[28:05] when examined in the light of scripture
[28:07] however there were two men in the
[28:09] british isles whose ministry in word and
[28:11] deed could stand the test of truth
[28:14] they were saint patrick and saint
[28:16] columba
[28:17] it was to saint columba that the lot of
[28:19] being the messenger fell
[28:22] though the messenger to the thyatirian
[28:24] age was saint columba
[28:25] i want to dwell a little on the life of
[28:27] saint patrick as an example to us and
[28:29] also to give the lie to rome's claim
[28:31] that st patrick was any more one of her
[28:34] than was joan of arc
[28:36] patrick was born to the sister of saint
[28:38] martin in the little town of bonavern on
[28:40] the banks of the river clyde
[28:42] one day while playing on the shoreline
[28:44] with his two sisters
[28:46] pirates approached and kidnapped all
[28:48] three
[28:49] where the sisters went no one knows but
[28:52] patrick his name was sucket
[28:54] was sold to a chieftain in northern
[28:56] ireland his duty was to tend the swine
[28:59] to do this he trained dogs
[29:02] so well trained were his dogs that many
[29:04] people came from far and near to buy
[29:06] them
[29:07] in his loneliness he turned to god and
[29:08] was saved
[29:10] then came the urgent desire to escape
[29:12] and return home to his parents
[29:14] he formed a plan that put his ability as
[29:16] a trainer to great use
[29:18] he taught the dogs to lie on him and
[29:20] cover his body carefully and not move
[29:22] until commanded
[29:23] thus one day when his owner sold several
[29:26] dogs patrick commanded the dogs except
[29:28] the leader of the pack to get into the
[29:30] boat
[29:31] the leader of the pack to which he then
[29:33] gave a secret signal ran off and refused
[29:35] to come aboard
[29:37] while the master and the buyer attempted
[29:38] to get the dog patrick got into the boat
[29:41] and signaled the dogs to cover him
[29:44] then with a whistle he brought the
[29:45] leader of the pack into the boat and on
[29:47] top of him
[29:48] since patrick was nowhere to be seen the
[29:51] buyer put up sail and moved out to sea
[29:54] after making sure that the captain was
[29:56] too far out to turn back
[29:58] patrick gave another signal to the dogs
[30:00] which caused them to riot
[30:02] then he came forth and told the captain
[30:04] that unless he would put him ashore at
[30:06] his home he would command the dogs to
[30:08] keep rioting and he would take over the
[30:10] ship
[30:11] however the captain was a christian and
[30:13] when he heard the boy's story he gladly
[30:15] put him ashore at his home
[30:17] there patrick went to bible school and
[30:19] returned to ireland whereby the word and
[30:22] the power of god in many signs and
[30:24] wonders he won thousands to the lord
[30:27] at no time did he ever go to rome nor at
[30:29] any time was he commissioned by rome
[30:31] the truth of the matter is that when
[30:33] rome finally gained a foothold on the
[30:35] island and when they saw the time was
[30:37] opportune they killed over one hundred
[30:39] thousand christians who had over the
[30:41] years grown out of the original group
[30:43] that had come to the lord under saint
[30:44] patrick
[30:46] about sixty years after the death of st
[30:48] patrick columba was born in county
[30:51] donegal north ireland to the royal
[30:53] family of fergus
[30:55] he became a brilliant consecrated
[30:56] scholar committing to memory most of the
[30:58] scripture
[31:00] god called him in an audible voice to be
[31:02] a missionary after he had heard the
[31:04] voice of god nothing could stop him and
[31:07] his miraculous ministry has caused many
[31:09] historians to acclaim him next to the
[31:11] apostles so great was his ministry with
[31:13] the supernatural signs following that
[31:15] some especially students in rome have
[31:18] thought the accounts were exaggerated
[31:20] in one of his missionary journeys as he
[31:22] approached a walled city he found the
[31:24] gates barred against him he lifted his
[31:27] voice in prayer that god might intervene
[31:29] and allow him access to the people in
[31:30] order to preach but as he prayed the
[31:33] court magicians began to harass him with
[31:35] loud noises
[31:36] he then began to sing a psalm
[31:39] as he sang god so increased the volume
[31:41] of his voice that he drowned out the
[31:43] cries of the heathen
[31:44] suddenly the gates burst open of their
[31:46] own accord he entered in and preached
[31:48] the gospel winning many to the lord
[31:52] on another occasion when he was also
[31:54] shut out from a village as he turned
[31:55] away to depart the son of the chief
[31:57] suddenly became violently ill even unto
[32:00] death
[32:01] saint columba was quickly sought after
[32:03] and recalled
[32:04] when he prayed the prayer of faith the
[32:06] boy was instantly healed the village was
[32:08] then opened to evangelization by the
[32:10] gospel
[32:12] the pure gospel that was preached by
[32:13] columba and his fellow workers spread
[32:16] over the whole of scotland turning it to
[32:18] god
[32:19] it also overflowed into ireland and over
[32:21] northern europe
[32:22] his means of spreading the gospel was
[32:24] one wherein perhaps twelve men under a
[32:26] leader would go into a new area and
[32:28] literally build a gospel-centered town
[32:31] amongst these twelve men would be
[32:32] carpenters teachers preachers etc all
[32:35] wonderfully versed in the word and holy
[32:37] living
[32:38] this little colony was enclosed by a
[32:40] wall
[32:41] soon this enclosure would be surrounded
[32:43] by students and their families in their
[32:45] own homes learning the word and
[32:46] preparing to go out and serve the lord
[32:48] as missionaries leaders and preachers
[32:51] the men were free to marry though many
[32:53] did not in order to serve god the better
[32:56] they remained free from state help and
[32:58] thereby steered clear of politics
[33:00] instead of ever attacking other
[33:02] religions they taught the truth for they
[33:04] believed that the truth was weapon
[33:06] enough to accomplish the ends that god
[33:07] had in mind for them they were
[33:09] absolutely independent of rome
[33:13] saint columba was the founder of a great
[33:15] bible school on the island of high
[33:17] off the southwest coast of scotland
[33:20] when he went there the island was so
[33:21] barren and rocky that it could not bear
[33:23] enough food for them all
[33:24] but colomba planted seed with one hand
[33:27] while he held the other aloft in prayer
[33:30] today the island is one of the most
[33:32] fertile in the world
[33:33] from this bible-centered island went
[33:35] forth mighty scholars endowed with
[33:36] wisdom and the power of god
[33:39] when i read the history of this great
[33:41] servant of god and the wonderful work he
[33:43] did it saddened my heart to find that
[33:45] the papal power lusting to bring all men
[33:48] into its grasp came and eventually
[33:50] defiled these mission fields
[33:52] and destroyed the truth as it was taught
[33:54] by columba
[33:56] the salutation
[33:58] revelation 2 18
[34:01] these things saith the son of god who
[34:03] have his eyes like unto a flame of fire
[34:05] and his feet are like fine brass
[34:08] the revelation of godhead to the
[34:10] thyatarian age is that jesus is the son
[34:13] of god
[34:14] once in the days of his flesh he was
[34:16] known as the son of man
[34:18] but henceforth we know him no more after
[34:20] the flesh he is no longer the son of man
[34:23] the great prophet who in himself
[34:25] gathered together all prophecies
[34:27] the only begotten is back in the bosom
[34:29] of the father
[34:31] now we know him after the power of the
[34:32] resurrection he is risen and has taken
[34:35] unto himself his mighty power and is
[34:37] above all and overall to the praise of
[34:40] his own glory
[34:41] his glory will he not share with another
[34:44] his leadership over the church he will
[34:45] not surrender to any man
[34:48] he looks down upon thyatira and here he
[34:51] sees in that city and in that fourth age
[34:54] the honor which belongs to him alone
[34:55] bestowed upon another
[34:57] his eyes blaze with the fire of wrath
[35:00] and judgment as he sees apollo revered
[35:02] as the son of god
[35:04] when he alone is the only begotten of
[35:06] the father
[35:07] how awful must be his judgment upon the
[35:10] religion of the thyatirian age wherein
[35:12] the church members like the pagan
[35:14] worshipers of the son of god apollo the
[35:16] son of zeus elevate a human ruler to
[35:19] adoration backed by the power of the
[35:21] state
[35:22] for that is exactly what he saw
[35:24] the roman catholic church fully immersed
[35:27] in idol worship based upon the rights of
[35:29] the sun god apollo had elevated a man to
[35:32] actual deity pope through the marriage
[35:35] of the church to the state
[35:37] for thomas aquinas and alvarez pelagius
[35:39] formulated and stated that
[35:41] the pope seems to those who view him
[35:43] with the spiritual eye to be not a man
[35:46] but a god there are no bounds to his
[35:48] authority
[35:49] he can declare to be right what he will
[35:51] and can take away from any their rights
[35:53] as he sees fit
[35:55] to doubt this universal power leads to
[35:57] being shut out from salvation
[36:00] the great enemies of the church are the
[36:01] heretics who will not wear the yoke of
[36:03] true obedience
[36:05] there is one mediator between god and
[36:08] men
[36:08] the man christ jesus
[36:15] [Music]
[36:34] you
