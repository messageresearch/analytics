[50:20] let's wait together raise two to five
[50:22] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[50:25] with a loud voice who is worthy to open

[50:32] man in heaven nor in earth neither under
[50:36] the earth was able to open the book know
[50:38] that to look their own and I wept much

[50:45] thereon and one of the other said unto
[50:48] me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe

[51:12] must increase
[51:12] I asked Heavenly Father o my speak to
[51:14] your children this evening in Jesus name
[51:16] we pray amen
[51:17] you may take your seats while I remain
[51:20] standing don't sit on your mouth I want
[51:23] to hear that Amen that hallelujah how
[51:26] many remember me how many remember me
[51:29] Wow like 80 percent or something like
[51:32] that very happy to be back to this
[51:37] church and I want to appreciate the
[51:39] pastor who has given me the opportunity
[51:42] to minister it to you on this very day
[51:45] understand it was a prayer meeting but I
[51:49] believe that God for ordained this day
[51:53] before the foundation of the world and
[51:55] he knew that I was going to minister and
[51:58] speak to you I wasn't supposed to be
[52:01] here tonight because yesterday was my
[52:04] birthday
[52:05] I was supposed to celebrate my birthday
[52:07] back home thank you I'm also accepting
[52:10] gifts just words but the kingdom of God
[52:16] is not in word only but it's in power in
[52:19] demonstration okay so I detect the
[52:24] pastor forgive me this opportunity and
[52:26] to those who I hear I say God bless you
[52:31] so much I want you to greet the brother
[52:33] next to you and say god bless you you're
[52:35] looking good looking good
[52:38] you're looking good one thing that I
[52:42] like go up a bit one thing I like about
[52:46] this church is I can preach from 1947 to
[52:49] 1965 and this church you say I'm into
[52:51] the world because what has brought us
[52:54] together is the message what to separate
[52:57] us is the message what will keep us
[53:00] together is the message so if you want
[53:02] to make me happy give me the message
[53:04] this is not a Pentecostal Church this is
[53:08] a gathering of eagles Who am I I'm a son
[53:12] of God where the caucus is there will
[53:14] the eagle's be gathered that's why
[53:16] problem says you are not feeding on me
[53:18] but you are feeding on the unfailing
[53:20] body weight of this son of man now I'm
[53:24] going to preach on the message code
[53:26] applying the talking in this evening
[53:30] time can you say that can you say that
[53:36] Amen now before we start
[53:40] God did not put us here on earth without
[53:44] a purpose there is a reason and a
[53:48] purpose to why we are here
[53:51] even as we don't just do things without
[53:54] a reason there must be a reason to
[53:57] everything you are here not by mistake
[54:01] good for ordained you before the
[54:03] foundation of the world now according to
[54:05] the natural laws there are many gems
[54:08] which could have made it
[54:10] when probably we understand science like
[54:13] they're their gems which we're trying to
[54:17] fight you know to make it but some of
[54:20] them died right there but your gem your
[54:24] sperm only made it through that's reason
[54:27] why you are here and we see that it was
[54:30] not by accident there are so many
[54:33] would-be siblings of yours who did not
[54:36] make it but you made it to come here on
[54:39] earth so I believe in predestination and
[54:43] I want you to know that we are destined
[54:48] ated there is going to be a bride come
[54:51] on shout amen
[54:53] can I hear better amen there is going to
[54:57] be a bride and they will be a bride I
[55:00] don't care what's going on around the
[55:02] message I don't care of those people who
[55:04] are cold or backslidden or too formal
[55:07] but I believe there is going to be a
[55:09] bride I am thankful this evening that I
[55:13] am one of them I am one of them if there
[55:18] are only 1000 members chosen bride
[55:21] members I believe that I'll be one of
[55:23] them if there are only 500 chosen
[55:26] members who are going to make it to the
[55:27] rupture I will be right one of them if
[55:30] there are only hundreds who are going to
[55:32] make it I will be one of them let me
[55:35] trim it down a little bit if they are
[55:36] only 50 who are going to make it I will
[55:39] be one of them if they are only three
[55:42] who are going to make it I want you to
[55:45] know that I will be one of them
[55:47] if there is only one who's going to make
[55:49] it I'm sorry about all of you I will be
[55:52] one of them that's how you're supposed
[55:54] to see it
[55:55] the scripture says blessed be the God of
[55:59] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[56:01] has blessed us with all spiritual
[56:04] blessings in heavenly places right where
[56:07] you are I want to tell you that you are
[56:09] blessed it might not look like you are
[56:12] blessed but you are blessed the Bible
[56:15] says he has blessed us with all
[56:17] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[56:20] our God is rich in mercy our God is rich
[56:24] in Graces and our God is rich in love
[56:27] yes blessed us with all spiritual
[56:30] blessings so if the Bible says you are
[56:34] blessed then you are blessed shout I am
[56:37] blessed shut I am blessed whether the
[56:41] devil likes it or not I am blessed
[56:43] whether my neighbor doesn't like it or
[56:45] not I am blessed you are blessed we are
[56:49] blessed and the bride is blessed don't
[56:52] look sad and look and look for pity you
[56:56] are the bride of Jesus Christ you are
[56:58] plain someone shot I am blessed you must
[57:01] wear a smile on your face and shout I am
[57:03] pleased because God is shining upon you
[57:06] I don't care how sick you are but you
[57:09] are blessed I don't care how many
[57:11] problems that you have but you are
[57:13] blessed if you are blessed receive your
[57:15] blessing I want my blessing
[57:18] I want my healing I want my Holy Ghost
[57:21] baptism now the scripture that we have
[57:27] read in the book of Exodus now we see we
[57:32] are now living in an hour with some are
[57:34] getting tired where some are getting
[57:37] swept away from the message with a lot
[57:39] of things going on and it's bringing
[57:42] discouragement on a lot of people but I
[57:45] do believe that there is so much on the
[57:47] positive side of the message to never
[57:49] allow depression to ever come to us in
[57:53] our lives God has revealed so much he
[57:57] has emptied himself so much in this last
[58:00] day
[58:00] to us I believe the brighter side is too
[58:03] bright that we can almost see the black
[58:06] spots the dev was trying both so we see
[58:09] in the time of Exodus God prepared a
[58:11] lamp for a house it was not one lamp for
[58:15] one family member it was one leg it was
[58:18] one lamp for every house Jesus the lamp
[58:23] of God this sufficient was sufficient
[58:25] for Zacchaeus in his whole house he said
[58:28] this day is salvation come into your
[58:31] house it was what Zacchaeus who repented
[58:34] it was what Zacchaeus who said if I've
[58:37] taken anything to you by false I'll
[58:40] restore it for fold and when the answer
[58:43] came from Jesus he was saved with his
[58:46] whole house it was one Rahab who
[58:49] received the lamp message it was one
[58:52] Rahab who received the messenger
[58:54] it was wondering who received the trap
[58:56] boys but she was given a token where
[58:59] whole house could come in the blood of
[59:02] Jesus who never lose its power to
[59:05] everyone who's in the mind of God who be
[59:09] saved to sin no more
[59:11] it was one Cornelius who had a baton to
[59:15] know Jesus it was one Cornelius who
[59:17] fasted it was one Cornelius who prayed
[59:20] when Peter came his whorehouse could
[59:23] come in it was one Jacob who got
[59:26] convicted it was one Jacob who saw the
[59:29] power of God and he said what can I do
[59:31] to be saved he didn't say what can we do
[59:34] to be saved
[59:35] then Paul says believe that God believed
[59:37] God it that you and your house shall be
[59:40] saved
[59:41] so it's a lamp for a house now your
[59:44] children have been given to you by the
[59:45] word of the Lord that's what the Bible
[59:47] says so God knows that you never be
[59:50] happy as long as your husband is outside
[59:53] God knows that your rejoicing coming to
[59:56] church but your joy will never be full
[59:58] as long as your father is outside so God
[1:00:01] is giving you a lamp for every house
[1:00:04] this message is not looking for you
[1:00:07] alone it's looking for your brother it's
[1:00:10] looking for your sister it's looking for
[1:00:12] your father it's looking for your mother
[1:00:14] it's looking for your children now it
[1:00:18] Pentecost when the word was preached
[1:00:20] people were pricked in their hearts not
[1:00:22] the children but the father's the way
[1:00:25] they said how can we do what can we do
[1:00:27] to be saved
[1:00:28] say so repent and be baptized in the
[1:00:30] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[1:00:32] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:00:33] Spirit
[1:00:34] it's for you fathers and your children
[1:00:37] by the authority of God's Word I want to
[1:00:41] tell you this evening that I give you
[1:00:43] your house come on judge I give you your
[1:00:46] house you must apply the token upon your
[1:00:50] house
[1:00:51] apply the token upon your brother apply
[1:00:54] the token upon your sister apply the
[1:00:57] token upon your children that's how we
[1:01:00] are supposed to see it how can I be
[1:01:02] happy to be ruptured without my wife how
[1:01:05] can I be happy to be ruptured without my
[1:01:07] husband
[1:01:08] so the token is going to draw in power
[1:01:11] in Genesis 22 Isaac had a question where
[1:01:17] is the lamp that question went for
[1:01:20] generations and if in Isaac's grand
[1:01:24] grand children kept asking where is the
[1:01:27] lamp
[1:01:27] Moses gave them limbs to sacrifice Moses
[1:01:31] ordained the sacrificial lambs but still
[1:01:34] that was never satisfactory then in
[1:01:36] Chapter number 1 and 29 of the poem of
[1:01:38] Jordan after so many years
[1:01:40] Jordan sees Jesus he's standing in the
[1:01:43] River Jordan and sports Jesus
[1:01:46] the ego eyes of Jordan so Jesus coming
[1:01:49] and said Behold the lamp
[1:01:52] behold the token behold the lamp that
[1:01:56] would take away the sin of the world
[1:01:58] so John answered Isaac's question in the
[1:02:03] River Jordan am i communicating so John
[1:02:07] answered Isaac's question when Abraham
[1:02:10] answered when Isaac has to say ways the
[1:02:13] lamp and what did Abraham said he said
[1:02:15] the Lord Himself not the priest not
[1:02:19] Moses the Lord Himself in other words
[1:02:22] the Lord himself shall become the Lamb
[1:02:26] the Lord Himself who provide another
[1:02:28] office of himself to take away the the
[1:02:31] sin of the world so when Jesus came the
[1:02:34] Prophet eyes of the Inka John spotted
[1:02:36] Jesus and said behold they'll talk him
[1:02:39] and John began to smile in his heart to
[1:02:43] say this is what I've been telling you
[1:02:45] about this is what he came to forerun
[1:02:48] you know my coming then the church ages
[1:02:52] came through then the lamb disappeared
[1:02:54] from the scene it disappeared from the
[1:02:57] physical scene then at the time of the
[1:02:59] opening of this news in Revelation
[1:03:01] chapter 5 the question was asked who is
[1:03:04] worthy to open the book or to look at
[1:03:08] the book and the Bible says no one was
[1:03:11] found worthy then the elder says whip
[1:03:14] not John behold the Lion of the tribe of
[1:03:18] Judah has prevailed he's ready to look
[1:03:22] at the book he's ready to take the book
[1:03:24] so don't look for the liar but he never
[1:03:27] saw the lion he saw the Lamb of God I
[1:03:30] wish I was preaching in Minneapolis he
[1:03:34] said behold my God my God my God
[1:03:37] clap your hands for Jesus so John you
[1:03:43] say John said all right so he's got to
[1:03:47] be a lamb before he becomes a lion he
[1:03:51] must bleed as a lamp before he rose like
[1:03:54] a liar
[1:03:55] who of us here ever thought that before
[1:03:58] you roll like a lion
[1:03:59] you must bleed at the level then after a
[1:04:02] while the Lord will lift you up because
[1:04:05] the way up is down before you come to
[1:04:07] church you must say I'm a sinner I make
[1:04:10] the token the left took our place and
[1:04:14] reviewed the suit so in the book of
[1:04:17] Exodus the lamb was given the blood they
[1:04:19] offer a token so when Isaac brought his
[1:04:22] question I promise anta was manifested
[1:04:26] on the River Jordan John answered
[1:04:29] Isaac's question so now at the time of
[1:04:32] the seven seals which is this day the
[1:04:35] book of redemption is reviewed again by
[1:04:37] the lamp
[1:04:39] the identification of the lamp in this
[1:04:42] endtime message is the climate of this
[1:04:45] message that we believe it cannot go
[1:04:48] beyond the identification of Christ this
[1:04:51] message cannot advance beyond the
[1:04:54] opening of the seals I'm preaching to
[1:04:56] Leonard people today this message cannot
[1:04:59] advance beyond the opening of this news
[1:05:02] amen you say men of God what about the
[1:05:05] rapture
[1:05:06] that's this opening of the seals that's
[1:05:08] what the rapture is all about we are not
[1:05:11] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:05:12] rapture the rapture is not a one-day
[1:05:14] event the rapture is a process you are
[1:05:18] raptured before your rap chart Enoch was
[1:05:21] raptured before he was raptured
[1:05:23] he kept walking with God he was walking
[1:05:25] with God and he reached a higher
[1:05:27] dimension I'm no longer operative from
[1:05:29] America I'm no longer offering from from
[1:05:32] Africa I'm not operating from the dead
[1:05:34] poor realm I am in the word and the word
[1:05:38] is in me I'm in this pocket word and the
[1:05:41] spoken word is in me I'm in the tech poo
[1:05:44] and the dead poison me rather I'm in the
[1:05:47] rapture but the rapture is in me you are
[1:05:49] already ruptured that's why you are
[1:05:52] rejoicing that's why you are saying amen
[1:05:54] because there is something in you that
[1:05:56] tells you that you're a rupture
[1:05:58] candidate there is something in you that
[1:06:01] tells you that you shall be changed
[1:06:02] before you a change you start rejoicing
[1:06:05] because there is a substance that is
[1:06:08] inside of you whoa clap your hands for
[1:06:11] Jesus so you no longer smoke you no
[1:06:27] longer drink you no longer do this but
[1:06:29] if the devil overcomes you the blood is
[1:06:31] there for you once you confess all your
[1:06:35] sins God does not remember that you ever
[1:06:38] did it there are people can't keep
[1:06:41] coming to God and say God you you keep
[1:06:43] telling God of the things that you have
[1:06:45] already confessed before you are wasting
[1:06:48] your precious time because what is under
[1:06:50] the
[1:06:50] that is under the plan and what does not
[1:06:53] remember brother branham with his gift
[1:06:56] of discernment
[1:06:57] if you confess your sim quad was not
[1:06:59] showing him confess the sins that's how
[1:07:02] powerful the blood of Jesus is so you
[1:07:05] are justified you are cleared your case
[1:07:08] has been dismissed if you accept Christ
[1:07:11] as your personal Lord and Savior you are
[1:07:13] clean and you are washed by the waters
[1:07:16] of the world and God does not remember
[1:07:18] so who is worthy
[1:07:20] nobody was fought worthy then the lamp
[1:07:23] came isn't it strange that the lamp took
[1:07:26] our place in innocent lamp a lamp is a
[1:07:30] young one of his sheep now if I report
[1:07:33] here because of time I have 23 minutes
