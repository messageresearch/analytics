TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] should become communism because of vulgar and dirtiness and the non-power of the Catholic church that's exactly why this nation is taking over communism and the generation of churches and jining itself up with the Catholic Church which Communism and Catholicism will unite together you know and here they are doing it why because they have rejected the gospel it separates them and makes them a different people and exactly the reason and ministers in the P pits putting up with it for a meal ticket for a social standing of some Creed say I belong to so and so swapping education for the power of God free them from this mad race like Mary magdalina the very power that could take that little strip tease on the street and make her put on clothes and act like a lady make a Christian out of her they condemn that power and crucify the man that had it at Calvary and today the very gospel in the Holy Ghost that'll take that little strip teas and make her dress like a lady and act like a Christian they call it fanaticism it don't mixed among their congregation get us stirred up among them caus other women to do it what do they do they OU it out just like they did then and now they crucify the very word and say it was for another age and died him again yes sir thank just the same as it was indied then the sign that made old Legion put on his clothes remember a person that takes off their clothes are crazy how about a woman Legion was crazy stripped his clothes off of him God butu his power and made him put his clothes on his clothed in his right mind sitting down at the feet of Jesus look at the power that made old blind barus to see right among their Creeds he was on the earth with just much unbelief as there is today but never stopped him he went on he didn't pull no punches for him he told him you your father the devil he condemned the whole thing the power that could raise Lazarus out of the grave and gave the woman of naan back her son oh God the power that can do those things that can foretell the things that happen there's two cult cult tied of two ways and all these things that he foretold the very man that possess that power away with him we won't have him among our people he pollutes our teachings and they crucified him the very same thing today they way with the Holy Ghost they don't want nothing to do with it it condemns and does these things and tells our people these things we don't want to get mixed among our organization it's against our Creeds that I him again oh my notice now as we're closing we got to close and again they call it fanaticism and they called him a fanatic they said he was crazy anybody knows that the Bible said that Jesus was them Pharisees said this man is a Samaritan and he's mad now what does the word mad mean crazy the man's crazy they're a bunch of crazy people follow him he's beab and again to say the same thing it's a sort of witchcraft it's fortune telling placing him again on the cross of Shame what cross what shame is a Vindicated word making fun of it telling the people it's a devil making something call he said they calling the holy works of God an unclean Spirit doing it no forgiveness part making shame of his word trying to expose it and call it a fake or fanaticism don't go to it don't attend them meetings what are they do doing that they take their denominational Creed Nails that's right these pleasure hun teachers worldly ungodly denominational mad take the denominational nails and crucify the Son of God with it aresh from their P pit amen why do they do this they love the Praises of man the degrees that the church can give them more than the love of the word of God I condemn him they can't conform to the world because they can't conform to the word because they're already conformed to the world they've already the hypocritical day that we live in is not this is not one Calvary enough for my Lord why will you do this you the supposed to love him you that knows this is his word you get can read Revelations the 22nd chapter and say whoever will take one word or add one word why do you do it isn't one Calvary enough for him amen I stand in his defense I'm his attorney I indict you by the word of God change your ways or you'll go to hell your denominations will crumble I indite you in the presence of the judge right you your forms of godliness hypocrisy why do you C it in one Calvary enough as Peter said your denominational fathers Peter and Di you by the said your which of your fathers hasn't done this Steven's done the same thing with Wicked hands you've crucified the Prince of Life didn't Jesus say himself which one of your fathers didn't put the prophets in the tombs and you garnish them afterwards so has it been through the righteous man down Through the Ages so do I indict this High polished churchgoing bunch of Christ rejecting people of this day you with your Farms of godliness Crucify My Christ the second time by telling the people that these words are for some other day and it isn't for this day I indict you you're guilty of the same crime that they was on the day of the crucifixion repent and turn to God or perish and again I say here the churches they the teachers crucify by blasphemy him the Worden God be merciful let me say that again it might have been mixed up on the table here the churches they the clergy crucify by blasphemy him the word Wonder it's again mid rendering rocking darkening Skies My Savior bow his head and Di but the opening Veil revealed away to Heaven's joys in Endless day amen I say on this tape and for this audience I say this under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost who's on the Lord side let him come under this word God will surely bring this wicked Christ deny rejecting generation into judgment for blasphemy the crucifixion of his identified word am you're coming to the Judgment I indied who's on the Lord's Side said Moses let him come unto me when the pillar of far hanging there is an Evidence Hallelujah who's on the Lord's Side let him take up the word deny his Creed follow Jesus Christ daily amen amen and I'll meet you in the morning let's bow our heads now for a word of prayer hallu oh Lord God The Giver of eternal life the author of this word who brought again from the dead the Lord Jesus who properly identified it before a a generation of unbelieving people it's been long this morning many is set here the church is packed people are standing around and the tapes are being made to go out across the world into different places ministers will hear this in their study I pray for them Lord let these words fall deep into the heart cut deep cut away all the world that they might say like this little Methodist Minister down in Kentucky came to me the other day and said when I was heing those seven churches and I heard it cry out get away from them walls of Babylon said I give it up and left I don't know which way to go or what to do but I left blessed be the courage of that young man the wife and to a three children God made many find their way to the word of God the only way of life for he is the word I pray for each one father sometimes in saying these things it's not in cruelty it's in love because love is corrective Hallelujah and I pray God that the people understand it to be that way that it is meant to be corrective you who had to correct and prayed for them at the cross saying father forgive them they they're blind they they just don't understand what they're doing I pray for them ministers today who's crucifying the word again by taking their Creeds and denomination and dogmas and substituting it for the word of life and then before the people they they criticize the real truth that God is vindicating to be his truth we pray for them Father that you will call them to the married supper again and may they come this time and not find excuses or I realize the last call may have already gone it may be too late now I trust that it's not bless this little congregation present here these few hundred people that's gathered in here this morning this hot day set here for a lengthy maybe 2 hours or more service hu and listen they haven't left they sit still and listen many of them waiting their dinners and the women standing with their babies and they're waiting they're holding on to every word Lord I realize what'll happen to me at the day of the Judgment if I mislead those people I'm conscious Lord is conscious that I can feel that I'm trying to take them to the word and let them live by the word telling them that you're the same yesterday today and forever that the great holy spirit is Jesus Christ just in the form of the Holy Ghost the same man you said so a little while in the world sees me no more yet you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you and I know that this is you Lord and we believe you because we see you do the same thing among us we yield ourselves as today soberly we do here in this congregation and on the tapes Lord just as this minute May every man and woman boy or girl who's who's here present or standing outside or here on the tape may we at this moment make a deep Consecration and yield our complete self to the service of God move upon the audience Lord in power and heal the sick they said they had a little boy sitting over here let that great Holy Spirit we know just to set his presence like this is it'll do it if you can go through radio and television out through the lands and heal the sick you sent your word and heal him you can do the same thing at this minute I pray God that you'll heal every sick person ever crippled ever Afflicted here and hears these words God granted my prayer is for them with a with a love of Christ in my heart and a feeling for the needy I present them Lord to you upon the altar of sacrifice where the bloody body of that lamb laid as a propitiation for our sins and sickness laying there I plead for Mercy for the people I want to stand as Moses did in the breach for them Lord and say God be merciful for him to them a little longer and give them another chance don't don't do it right now Lord let let the gospel go just a little further they're they're condemned Lord I pray that your great mercy and Grace will will extend to the last person that's got their name on the book and I know they will it's not hard to pray against your Divine word against or against the with the Divine word I mean to say Lord the word that's promised the word that's been Vindicated the word that predestinated these people back there before the foundation word it's not it's not hard to to pray that you'll save those whose names are on the book because I know you'll do it Jesus said so all the father has given me will come and no man can come unless he's been given now I pray God that everywhere these words fall both on tape and present here that the holy spirit will call ever predestinated person just now from the foundation of the world when their name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life may they hear the voice of God speaking today in that little still Small Voice down in their heart saying this is the way walk in it granted father I asked that in Jesus name and while presently we have our heads bowed here in the audience if you believe this to be truth and you you I've B put my hand up on these handkerchiefs laying here in packages for the sick and The Afflicted I want to ask you a question sincerely now I don't come down here just to be heard uh uh I'm tired I'm wore out I'm not as young as it used to be and I and I know our days are numbered and I know I got to put in every little thing that I can the kingdom of God I got to preach every time I get a chance I got to I got to go whether I feel like it or not I come here because I I feel to do it I I want to do it I love you and I don't say things harsh and hard to to because I want to there there's a pulsation inside of me this very thing that's been Vindicated is a thing that presses me to do these things I say it kindly with love I don't mean to scold our women or our man I don't mean to do that brother sister I only mean to bring you to a a sharp place to where you can see the correction and the whip of the Lord that you must come in now don't put it off you might wait too long and you who desire to come on the large side with a full surrender in your heart in the presence in the audience now or either in the land where the tapes will be would you with your heads bowed don't raise your hands if you don't mean it
