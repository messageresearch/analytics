all are like oh wow that's amazing such a great faith he's like crying out to God two seconds before that God what do I do and God put gay God gave him the word to act out upon and he simply acted on it and that's it it's the same thing for us that we're living by faith or walking by faith we're stepping out it's scary to walk by faith but we're trusting him we're not trusting in our own selves we're not we don't have the same message as the world has we're not walking in the counsel of the ungodly we're not standing in the way of sinners we don't have the same if we're not careful we'll be like Asaph where we listen to the call of the world the same fears that apply to them don't apply to us they do in our body we feel those things and those are there but we have a promise I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you never and God said it and I believe it Laurie yes amen let's fight tonight let's stand in sing it and see the fight is on praise the Lord the fight is on o Christian

preaching [Music] [Music] and the people all said out of the young we got a text from sister Rekha a sister Rebeka brother David writes a youngest daughter was at yesterday early yesterday morning yep anyway she attacks in the Oh me to tell me that I needed to call brother David even made a list of different people that he wanted to talk to you and he wanted to say goodbye to you just in case and so anyway I got the phone number from her and then when I got to work I gave brother David a call and my his voice sounded perky and I told was a brother Dave and I was in the office on Saturday and I meant to call you at that time but I you know I just didn't get to it and so he said brother on Saturday he says I was really in a world of hurt he said I was I couldn't even get up out of bed and if when the nurses and doctors tried to come in and move me every time they tried to move me I'd just be an excruciating pain and he said then on all that day and all the decks all the way up through Sunday night he said he couldn't pass any fluids he says his for 36 hours and so his kidneys were shutting down and so then by Sunday night he was able to he was able to pass some fluids a little bit just a little and then Monday morning he said by Monday you know the nurse want to do that you know I'm trying to help him to see if he could pass some more fluids and he and he just told her so we'll just leave the urinal by my bed and and then he says oh you know let me try to do it myself you know and so anyway a little little later on he got he actually got up out of bed stood up over there David has been in a wheelchair for years and he was actually - able to pass fluids normally um keep in mind when they tried to do exploratory to find out what was wrong besides his blocked artery they he actually they had to resuscitate him twice that's when they went in to look see what was wrong and it was they thought it was a couple of heart valves were not working right and so the doctors have basically told them you know where do we we can't risk doing surgery on you because like I said we had to you know we had to bring you back to life twice already and so we won't even try so they were done doctors had all they feel they can do so anyway he was able to stand up his daughter Rebecca said this is the first time I've seen him stand in five years and so he doesn't have any pains in his hearts anymore and so when I was talking to him I said well brother you know it says it now that you're up you know you can stand up says I'm just looking I says I'm still holding you to coming up here it's about time you get up here he says well be chasing each other down the aisle and so anyway so I told I was gonna call him back so I called them just before service and and then when he answered the phone before I even said anything I just said I woke up the small one with my mind stayed on Jesus and he broke right in on a tube so we were singing at each other on the phone his voice even sounded stronger and he said he says brother Scott he said you know I just had a sister from Mississippi call me today she had been looking she couldn't find brother David's phone number and of course he's the pastor a church down there and but she had been looking for a year to try to find his phone number tried to ask others and couldn't find him she said lo and behold this morning she opened up her phone book and there was and so anyway so there was and she called him she says that we need for you to come down to Mississippi and so brother David told me today he said Russ God he says I feel this is the best I've felt in 10 years 10 years since so anyway he was actually it instructed his son you know he has this handicapped dam and he had instructed his son to sell that I am so it could cover the cost of his funeral and so he went back to sons as his son said whoa whoa whoa this is stop that I says you can sell it when I'm done with it and so he said he's got his and then his sister I think I think has been calling him from Rockford Illinois and so so I says what you try to tell me is you're gonna go down to Mississippi first then you're gonna go hey he told me says I'm gonna go down to Mississippi I'm gonna come up through Illinois up to Rockford and I'm coming to Minneapolis and then I'm going over to Michigan and I'm going up into Canada to preach for those Saints up there he said the doctors look at him they are just amazed he says he has pain but it's in his in his muscles and he says it's because I am I haven't been doing anything I just wasn't laying around he says if I get up and start moving around he said I'm gonna be I'm gonna feel even better but he says he's not having any pain I can't doctors can't figure out why he's not having on any heart pain or anything like that and so I just told us that what you just tell them that you had a consultation with you with the chief physician doctor Jesus amen so I was I was telling him about brother Moses I said brother I says that's just very interesting to me I says because I told my brother Moses testimony now that the doctor and he came back and doc says you shouldn't how can you even see out of that eye and by the way your suppose you should be blind in your other eye to doctors can't figure that one out either and I think brother bloody was going to share a testimony they're looking and it's doing the same thing with sister Keisha and now they're trying to figure out at that hospital why she doesn't look like she's on death's doorstep Oh everything that the doctors can do all their charts all their technicalities other all the things that they can measure says that she should be ready to pack it in I says but she just looks like she's ready to come out you know just it makes me think of Elijah saints of God he said he went he went and told her servants just go look on the horizon go look again he did seven times and he said that's seventh time he says I see what do you see I see the cloud the size of a man's hand he like just said it's time to get moving right now and you better get going as fast as you can so saints of God I believe we're serving the same God I believe we're seeing the same cloud on the horizon I just have to sing one thing it's gonna rain again it's gonna rain again there's a downpour coming I can feel it in the wind it's gonna rain again it's gonna rain again it's gonna rain again well the town for coming I can feel it in the wind it's gonna rain again let's sing it now it's gonna rain again it's gonna rain again there's downpour coming I can feel it in the head it's gonna rain again I guess I picked an off-key and so on for the blotting gum Alleluia so I'm looking forward to I told brother Damon when he comes up here I'm gonna we're gonna chase each other down the I praise the Lord Amen sister Phyllis let's try that song we have in there somebody loved me answer my prayer that just do that chorus 2:9 somebody loved me answer my prayer I love somebody I know he cared somebody tells me that Tory power that's all my ladies Jesus and I know he's mine somebody loved me and saw my prayer oh I love somebody I know he can

not just a story let's do that tonight he may I just feel like praising the Lord for all the things that he's doing for his people amen praise the Lord amen I'm so glad I know who Jesus is [Music] Jesus is he's more than the stories he's the king of glory I'm so glad I know Jesus Harry oh yes I'm so fine I know Jesus a [Music] I know Jesus Oh yet peaceful and the story is again the glory Passover I know let's do that one more time I know [Music] and the key I'm so bad I know praise the Lord lasting tonight amen we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus praise the Lord you know our just thinking that if the Lord bless us amen and he can be able to make some provision for us yeah we might just have a prayer service this coming Thanksgiving weekend we won't have service in a week and we can just come Saturday evening and just sink and just testify amen so find something to give God thanks about amen don't come complaining here you just come with something to give God praise about it the Lord bless us we will just keep there before the Lord Psalm 103 let's just read tonight Amen I mean there is just a lot of things to praise the Lord about remain amen praise the Lord like brother Scott say we visited with sister Kish last night in and she was testifying to us and and she's in the region hospital there in Bransford is a small hospital in her case is bigger than the hospital her medical condition is bigger than the hospital so every doctor that comes in it just like a real light right on the ball and everybody want to look at her situation oh my goodness what the patient we have here you know in everybody you know going back in and you know situation looks so terrible to all the doctors there but yeah when the goalie in the room she's smiling and laughing praise the Lord they can figure that out they thinking that it should be having someone there but they have someone laughing coming out and we want to thank the law for their amen praise the Lord glory be to God Psalm 103 bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits amen that's what I want for us to do this coming Thanksgiving weekend who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases and let the church say Amen amen let's learn to respond to the word praise the Lord amen whoo Redeemer the life from destruction will cry of thee with lovingkindness and tender mercy who satisfy the mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagle the Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed he make known his ways unto Moses his ass unto the children of Israel the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger anger and plenteous in mercy he will net always chai needle will he keep his anger forever he have not dead with us after our sins none rewarded us I call into our iniquity for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy towards them that fear him as far as the east is from the west so far has he removed our transgressions from us like us a father pitieth his children saw the law paid hear them they fear Him Amy let's pray together - now father we are so grateful Lord that God you are staying in the healing business and healing is the children's brain their Lord God we can rejoice in these things of God that we read it in the Bible father God how you heal the sick and raise the dead but Lord is not only a story Lord it's a living event of God because it's happening right among us Lord and we thank you precious Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we preach about the quickening power Lord garden and you're gonna kill it preacher but that on Sunday Lord guy we think about a love father but it's good to know to God that it the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead word in us and we're quicken our mortal body and father we want to thank you for the quickening power Lord upon brother David right through God Heavenly Father Lord Jesus and we believe that same quickening power that's upon sister quiche and that same quickening power to support all of your children Lord like David said quick endowed me Oh God father we pray tonight that Lord you would bless them and be with them Oh father and Lord your children that couldn't be with us tonight we ask that you bless them also we pray to God and we just commit this time into your hands so father that you would come down Lord and speak to us O God out of your word tonight we are grateful or we appreciate you Lord what a wonderful Savior you are in Jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen Allah bless you you may have your seat amen praise the Lord we stay talking on the bounding power and losing power but tonight we want to go in another last week we look at that under the the dream of Joseph and tonight we want to locate honor the scapegoat amen that is we want to we want to look at the bounding and the losing power realizing that is it's a power is the key that was giving to appealing jesus said upon this rock I will build my church but here is the key when this when this house is built when this body this bill this is the key that you will use and with this kid whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven amen and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven praise the Lord so we've been talking about this bonding power as awesome as as a power of the Holy Ghost it's almost like in in us in John chapter 12 a pentakus has not come but the Bible says after Jesus came resurrected he breathed upon the disciples and he said receive here the Holy Ghost praise the Lord so in another sense Jesus was giving you know just just an earnest to the church that you you will have such a power that's that's what the Holy Ghost is is the keeping power is the bounding power praise the Lord and and that's why we want to look at tonight in in in this type of Leviticus chapter 16 now in the Leviticus chapter 16 when you read there you realize that God told Moses and when it come down to this to this sin offering he was supposed to take to God's praise the Lord amen he was supposed to take to God's let's look in Leviticus chapter 16 and we can read from verse 20 Leviticus chapter 16 I want us to just see a picture of the bounding power in the losing power year and when he had made an end of reconciling the holy place and the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar he shall bring the life God and Aaron shall lay his hands upon the head of the life God and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgression in in all the ascent spotting them upon the head of the God and she sent him away by the hand of a faith man into the wilderness and the God shall bear upon him all their iniquities onto the lane net inhabited and he shall let go the gold in the wilderness praise the Lord Amen now so we see here God is assuring year true the priesthood as we looking at this at this bound in power now remember over in in some chapter 103 that we have just read David said you know the law being mindful of us has not there with us according to our iniquities he Naurang our frame he nor him you know who we are he knowing that even some of the things that you know we are trapped into his is you know there are things that comes down from you know through our change that comes from our grandfather you know God knows all about this he understand everything about it praise the Lord amen but yet David says this that ask the east is far from the west and also listening to the statement also he said as a father pitieth his children amen then we know that the mind of the Father Jesus expressed the mind of the father when he said all that the father has given me will come and now one will be lost praise the Lord that's what this bounding power is all about it's almost like butter bread I'm talking about that great magnet speaking about the rapture it's a power that keeps it's a power that draws he says if I be lifted up I will draw all men and we together so it's in in in God's mind in his infinite mind he lays out out of this so you ever said he's telling Moses here when you come to this place and of the same offering you bring to God and he says the first God is going to be for the Lord that is the God that is going to be killed that's going to be sacrificed for the people and then the next God is going to be a scapegoat praise the Lord so the priest comes he laid his hands upon the scapegoat he confessed his scene he confessed the scene of the people he confessed the scene of the nation then is given to this man you know and then he goes as far into a place in the wilderness where nobody has inhabited he's going to go to a place where the God will now be able to trace his way back that's odd that is as far as he's going to go praise the Lord and that God is going to be it let loose it will wonders and wander and Wonder and wander until it dies praise the Lord when it does huh is that it's neither priests business he don't know anything about it he just said that God I'll and it goes out that's the losing power praise the Lord the God that is sacrificed for the people writing the camp that's the bound in power now listen to brother branham as he as he as he talks about this a little bit now before we get to that we read this the last time and I want to take that again poor the best there test that year he says our Heavenly Father you said whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose shall be loosed in heaven Lord that's your word is that the Word of God let's say amen amen he says who so ever seen is remade now what is happening here is that he's taking these two promises together whatsoever is bound on earth will be bound whatsoever is loosed will be loosed who so ever seen is remade it will be remitted who so ever seen is retaining it's trying to bring their two promises together it looks like two different promises but they are speaking of the same thing are we together also ever seen you remain to them it would be remanded who's ever seen you retain to them it will be retain it that's what you promised and now in obedience to your word I lay my hands upon our sister and bless her and to lose her from this trouble in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and just like I said if you go instead of brother Branham caught on on the places that he used this bounding and loosing he used them all in the prayer line rebuking sicknesses from off of God's children amen claiming them for healing that's the binding power that's what the burning power supposed to do is supposed to keep healing in the camp it's supposed to keep us healthy amen and the losing power supposed to set us free from the things that are not of God like he says the Word of God is a two-edged sword we can also look at it like that because all that is that wishes not of God and it keeps in that wishes of God in the church ages he says this is a good principle for us to learn he says for us to encourage what is what is right and discourage what is wrong the bounding and the losing power so yeah he takes those two promises in a word he brings them together because in the mouth of one of two or three let every word be established he stands upon death and he rebukes sickness from upon their sister let's take this one again Jehovah Jireh Woo's whosoever seen you remain to them they are remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they are retain it but how did they do it Peter said the one that had the keys to it on the days of Pentecost he say repaint every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of your sin praise the Lord amen he says that's how it is done by accepting the word praise the Lord because that word as ayah said his word go out and it will now return back to him vow when the word goes out it goes and it attracts the ILIT all the ls are attracted to the word praise the Lord that's the burning power to bring God's children home you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost is that rice he show it's not nothing man can do is what God has done amen so right here in Leviticus chapter 16 Christ is the high priest Christ is the God that was sacrifice and Christ is also the scapegoat He fulfilled oh praise the Lord amen he's also the man that takes the scapegoat just as he is the high priest that sacrificed the life God he's the man that takes us that the scapegoat into the wilderness where burns a seared position of a believer any stripped and a scripture to logic teacher who know the scapegoat of the Old Testament and so far he was both Christ I know you have there Brethren's here believe that the devil was the scapegoat but no no no no Christ was both both death and resurrection you see and he bought ours our sin away and then came forth in the resurrection and so it so it was Christ being represented for for the church he took the church place of sin and was cast into outer darkness into hell rose again the today God raised him up for our justification and he did that all the basis of one scripture I love that amen he says on one Scripture and off a meaning sir who'll it's a backslide spoke the scripture was that Minister David he's just taking it in that time you know I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption the owner scripture I find in the Old Testaments book by prophecy that God was going to do it so he did he did not leave his soul in hell and the reason Jesus knew that within three days he will rise up again because it was poking there he will not leave his holy one in hell praise the Lord amen and then brother Branham is even making it beautiful year that that the resurrection of Jesus Christ hang on the prophecy of a backsliding preacher David David crying to God in repentance of his sin he was crying to God take not your Holy Spirit away from me restored onto me in the joy of my salvation he says I know you and I'll leave your Holy One in Hell crying to God in repentance but yet it was a prophecy to bring our Lord out of the grave praise the Lord what is that is the bound in power the same thing that will bring him closer to God will also lose him of the things I want to take him far away from God are we together I want us to see it here in in the life of of the scapegoat he says he represented in Old Testament they had a sin offering at the cleansing of the center order he says and they are seen offering was dead they taking to God's and one was killed in the other God how the same debt was placed upon that upon the dead God put upon the lifeguard remember Jesus was a sheep I love this I mean he was a sheep he was alarmed but in this case he became a god he was righteousness because he was God the Sheep but he came a God saying that he might be the sin offering for me and for you from a sheep to a God and Jesus was represented in in in both animals and also in both goat for one he died he died for the atooma in the second one the scene from the Atomium was put upon the Skip God and the Skip go talk the scene of the people and when fire into the wilderness to bear the scene of the people what was it it was the death and the barrier of our Lord Jesus amen he says and that God had to go out into the wilderness and dine and to be out there alone among the beasts and so forth Jesus had to be their God I want you to notice he was alarmed he was a sheep but he was made good for you and I that we being God might be made sheep amen we brain being seen a guilty of the F subject to death and also out on the condemnation yet Christ became me that I through His grace might become him a son of God seated at the right hand of God in glory the love that he had how he expressed it how he had to to make himself what he was to die to save us praise the Lord and we have that bound in power today praise the Lord remember whatever we bind on earth will be bound in heaven you ever think about it the 1000 year reign with Christ and the Bible says Satan will be bound for 1,000 years it's that bound in power I mean God is going to get his Saints and we're all going to be 100% now we all as a body makes hundred percent well at that time every individual is going to be hundred percent now we are now hundred percent as an individual but I support it we are hundred percent are you honest enemy amen but at that time every son of God and every daughter of God is going to be one hundred percent and Satan will be bound praise the Lord amen he will be bound we will live in there in in in the fullness of righteousness the abounding power is going to keep evil to us from our mind 1,000 years praise is going to be on our left amen our torch is going to be God's taught and we together and then one right after the 1,000 years he will be loosed so we would come right back to the place again of fighting my battles and making decision praise the Lord whatsoever power or whatsoever you bind on earth will be bound what am i driving toward with this verbatim says the church is almost losing its bounding power praise the Lord it's where we get to the place and and you know we live in on a privilege and you know it's almost like we want to get in by the skin of our teeth in and and think they're all yeah we we have to know that we ourselves and daughters of God now that we are going to be now we are praise the Lord and the prophet of God said we you have that power in you it's lying dormant amen you have to know you have that quickening power in you you have that bounding power in you and you can go right back to the word and keep away from your life what is not of God praise the Lord I was talking over to those galaxies in the air in the book of Galatians and then you were selling them the very same thing that Christ has free us from it looks like we are entangling our set back in it in the church age Bock he says he that have loosed us with his own blood we're balances then it has to be a perfect Muhsin praise the Lord now what I'm trying to establish with this stud aside ragged is it's in the place that the both the bounding powered and the losing power was what was given to the church to be to be used by the church let against the church even when it comes over to to Matthew chapter chapter 18 as we as we said it together and and a man that that has get got himself in in a rebellious form and we're not listening to correction the how power is even used against him to bring him back to God because he's a son of God amen because he's a son of God he has Christ here fulfilling the sacrifice God and he's also fulfilling the scapegoat even though he said God is an animal but you think about it that innocent animal cut taking from all from him on his friends and he's going to be walk into the wilderness and even the man that is carrying him have to be careful before he gets lost because he got to carry this gold up the mountain down the valley carry him to a place where he would not be able to find his way back and he was loose and that is how much that God want to lose us from habit from the nature of sin from this life praise the Lord experiencing the power of God people that has been delivered the knows the knows exactly what I'm talking about that you can even thing in your mind that I used to do this and you can even trace your way back that's how much the blood of Jesus Christ moves us it takes it as far as the East is from the West praise the Lord so there's a power that the church has that God has given to his children just like jesus prayed in a matthew chapter 17 he said father these are mine don't take them out of the world but keep them here praise the Lord keep them right here but keep him in your loving I just like go see and also as a time it was right there in Egypt but Elsa ban empowered I kept light and gushing that free Goshen from all the Flies and all the frogs it was right there in Egypt but it was free from all of those plagues that was coming we have that burning power praise the Lord Amen or in the end is being used over and over glory be to God that is the reason why as a child of God and at the Church of the Living God we don't give up amen we don't give up because the father never give up on us I mean people come and you know they get strewed struggle to get discouraged and you know and then and that is the reason why God you know he will raise all people in the body he would take them through things and he would just give them such a faith even though they happy I own about about God will always keep them there it's almost like brother Branham says in in spoken word is old regionals he he said life comes through the body I mean life comes through the body we can have Church here we can we can have Church can have and have an assembly here today because there was a body that was here for life to come here whether it was two or three amen as long as that body was here life would definitely come here life comes through the body that's the power that's been given to the church is to be able to keep the good things in the things of God in the promises of God in and keep that thing of the enemy out there are some things I can say that you know that I really broke my spirit and I knew that God was sitting on his throne amen you know brother Branham said in the church order he says you know right you yo your requests and things and you see just laid him on the altar you know if you can lady on the auto or give it to the Deacons and they will lay on the altar and the son leader will come you know and and it's easy to just take those things in in a kind of a routine waiter in you know just like a church order and their end and the song leader come or that they can come and read the prayer request and you know and and we prayed about it then but sometimes God will put some things on your heart praise the Lord I felt so blessed last week preaching on the bound in power there are couple of checks that I've written and I sign it you know I I put my request here it's signed by Jesus Christ and co-signed by me praise the Lord and I keep them right here believing that God is going to cash them praise the Lord and talking on the bounding power and how God with that power that is given to the church we can call backsliders back to God amen we can pray strain into the weak and feeble once amen we can we can give desire to the ones that have no desire to serve God because when you get assaulted they will get testing that's what we're Branham said I mean internal life is living for others and on this check I wrote tough I don't know how it just came I was just sitting right here last week and I wrote sister Catherine Internet I've signed that thing and cache it believing that God is going to cash it oh my goodness me and I'll just preaching last week and now I'm not even knowing they're going to be here and I'll be the same and all of these people you know you know the aghast children praise the Lord if we believe that we has a binding power and with that bound in power and God's promise that whatever we bind on earth and we can do that for our loved ones amen we can do that for them you have to keep them close to your heart you have to love them you have to pray for them you have to clean them that's what the bound in power is the church on the Reformation you know talk that and win in an extreme you know and and apply s communication and I mean in a sense that the the kind of a base on the discipline but the purpose of the discipline is to keep all of God's children because jesus said now one the father would last so in whichever way that we have to get them back we have to get them back praise the Lord and realizing there they are they are fighting spirits that is even bigger than them that we can use the flesh to go out after them amen if you're not praying for them you just using the flesh if you hate to see them you just using the flesh whenever you see them and you put your eyes up or this one is just you just using the flesh that that would never be able to redeem God's children trace a lot jesus said he says when a strong man has taken over in your home and most of the time I tell people sometimes people are dealing with things that is bigger than them praise the Lord they are dealing with things that is bigger than they main and and sometimes they think they know what is didn't we but whatever you dealing with that you can get under control is bigger than you and you need to call for the man of the house amen you need to call for the man of this house to come and take it over because the purpose of the bounding power is to kick out anything that does not belong in the house amen Barbara I'm said it in restoration of the bride trained on one of those messages you see why if you go to your house tonight he says and you get home and then you just you meet intruder in your house playing music you know drinking alcohol and doing all of those things I mean just abuse in your home what are you going to do is about law the state has given us the right to call 9-1-1 I mean to ask those forces or axis people to get out of our house to keep them out because they do not belonged in that's the bound in power and the losing power you only want to keep in your house what you need to keep thee and that is the same thing about this house praise the Lord if the enemy bringing discouragement and he bring him pains and he brings in sickness he's trying to bring in all habits you have the right to call the enforcing agent which is the Holy Ghost to kick to kick it out praise the Lord we have the right to live as a son of God or to think as a son of God to believe as a son of God to enjoy this Holy Ghost enjoyed this promise of God praise the Lord so we see the principle right there of the bounding and the losing power in the life of the of this sacrifice that is made of the scapegoat and Christ forfeited all their birthday and she's also year let's read the end and we find a place to close here praise the Lord Amen sir we will see Jesus he says you don't have to know a whole lot like we sang tonight just used a little you have praise the Lord you don't have to know a whole lot you only have to know one person that's the Lord Jesus Christ to know him it's life that's the owner person you have to know to have eternal life to know him not know the Box not know the Creed's but know him is internal I've know him as your personal Savior know him as the one who has fill you with His goodness in His mercy that send the word away from you discharge it send it away like the scapegoat lose you that's the losing power Amen he have loosed you if we know that the prophet of God preached a message the cruelty of sin and a penalty that was paid for our sin praise the Lord that's the reason why Paul says over there in a book of in the book of Hebrew there for us to turn this grace down it's almost like trumping over the blood the very same blood that was paid for our sin it's in blood they have set us free that it's like we are walking over the blood of Jesus praise the Lord what should people keep anger and keep molly's and keep bitterness if we think about what Christ have done to set us free why should we hold dearly to these things why should people hold to to to unconfessed sin in their life he's not going back to the cross again to die why should we hold things in our life when there is a sacrifice when there is an atonement to set us free why can we exchange that and it's easy just accept the sacrifice accepting the word like Peter said believe repent and be baptized when we accept the word that word loses us it set us free it does not only set us free but it has the power to also keep us and those things will now roll back in our lives they might come and hang around and go around like like bees but we have faith to blow it away every time praise the Lord that's the bounding power you've been given the power to keep those things away that's the power that is in the church you be giving the power to keep the one you love so close to your heart and keep believing for them like Peter said believe you and your household shall be safe we have the bounty power to pray for all of these ones brother Antonin sister Esther all of these people amen you know the thing about it is it's not just church it's to realize that people come and sit on this blessed gospel they confess faith with us they sing glory be to God I am a child of the king it goes down into water baptism they walk down the aisle and take communion with us praise the Lord and then out of a sudden we don't see them again oh it's so easy to think of they are not serious all those people they're not serious they don't want to serve God and just feel with wardeness and all of that and we just going to give up like that you know how much work is put into getting someone to the water to be baptized you know how much work is put into getting people together from the house and come to church you pray for the service this morning you know how much work you put into when you say Lord just bless the service this morning we were the brothers and sisters as the travel sibling you know how much work you put into that because every power and spirit in hell is against that if it's left with the devil we should we should not have Wednesday service let's just be religious Sunday morning is enough we shouldn't even have special meetings let's just be like you know all the other churches so it's just so in the morning and everybody can come in their best suits in and comment and we can just get a good dedicated for the five minutes or 30 minutes service and after we have work someone like sister Esther we saw how coming to church in pains walking through those doors and so had the grace of God redress her and how can we for our hands church how can we be comfortable that someone like that we just go away from the grace of God what is our trophy what does our work the church you have a power to keep just as it is half for souls to coming to be safe issue we we must work hard to not let them go if they are sons and daughters of God we must keep him that's the power that is given to the church that was water the the the the church in the book of Acts belief as long as much as they could not give darkest unto death even the ones that were backsliding him and weak in faith the church was not just folding his hands and just giving up on people and we just find led to excuses if they were now of us that's why they left those are just poor excuses it just poor excuses do you know what we do into that sacrifice on cavalry because Christ did his work now it's our time he was the scapegoat when he was going to cavalry it was him and him alone the disciples could not even stay up to pray with him and you know what brother that was seven God before and you know a sister that was seven God before and you're getting out and we we just so easy give up I said well then maybe they are not elect or maybe they were come out I was fully virgin and we get all of these terminology flow in our minds let me tell you tonight water it is bright or it is foolish virgin all the ones that would be saved at the white throne judgment it was one blood that paid the price for all the redeemed the blood the bride don't have a different blood then the foolish virgin blood the bride don't have a different blood and up then the the the souls that will be saved in denomination there's not two different blood that saves them it was just one blood praise the Lord that's what I'm talking about they're bound in power we will not be able to give up in our lives we won't give up on our selves we when I give up on others musicians who can come let's bow our heads tonight that's why Jesus said he that would bring on offense is better a millstone be hanged on his neck he that would cause a stomach block to stop any of my little ones from coming in and Mail stone would be hanged on his neck is rather he Hank a millstone and drying himself because as far as the father is concerned he's not ready to lose any of his he can leave the ninety-nine and straight and go after one and that's what the burning power would do the binding power in you we scribe to keep that fire burning to keep to keep to keep a sacrifice on the altar [Music] you always be birding for somebody you always have somebody on your mind on your heart praying for [Music] let's pray together tonight as you think about different ones let's pray together tonight brother Branham says as long as life is in their body we would go after them he says if you can go send somebody if you can send nobody send a prayer a prayer can go faster than him or can go you send a prayer after them amen if you can send somebody send an angel and say Lord let the angel of the Lord go let the angel of the Lord trouble they're highly dangerous Restless we have their power we have to abound in power we have a power to bring sinner honor arrest [Music] we have the power to deal with stubborn ones [Music] Heavenly Father dear Lord the simple
