[43:24] support the service and uh uh uh and all
[43:29] those that will also follow the service
[43:33] online praise the
[43:35] Lord and uh for many many few years we
[43:40] had uh uh lot of the brothers coming a
[43:45] certain time of the year and most of the
[43:47] most of that time will be between June
[43:50] and uh in
[43:52] September uh if you do remember we we
[43:56] sometimes we have floss of brother
[43:58] coming all through uh every other week
[44:02] or every week or so as much as we can
[44:05] get them in now the reason there is
[44:08] there are uh most of those Brothers come
[44:12] for a longstanding mission meetings that
[44:15] brother brother Joe
[44:16] Green they've been having for over 51
[44:20] years and uh
[44:25] uh so I mean they come from all over the
[44:28] world uh uh from Africa Asia and I mean
[44:33] just everywhere they come so most of the
[44:35] time when they come the few that know us
[44:38] try to make contact and then we have
[44:40] them come you know uh uh brother Samuel
[44:45] OTA that was here from
[44:47] Uganda uh and then uh many of the
[44:49] brothers we can we can call their names
[44:52] and they're all coming for that
[44:54] meeting so uh we we kind of made contact
[44:59] with brother Joel earlier this year and
[45:01] wanted him to come and just visit with
[45:03] us and I was just I was just sharing him
[45:06] sharing with him a little bit and uh uh
[45:09] I just felt like uh uh you
[45:14] know they are men that dedicate their
[45:17] time to you know their work to different
[45:20] things you know some are greatly
[45:23] involved in printing books and and other
[45:26] things like even from our little
[45:28] assembly year we try to do the little
[45:30] that we can and uh supporting some of
[45:34] the missionary brothers that are out
[45:35] there so when these brothers come they
[45:37] are all coming on one miss one Mission
[45:40] need or another and the little the
[45:43] little bit we think that we can we can
[45:46] do or encourage them is to just have
[45:48] them come down speak for us in a little
[45:50] way that we can support them we try to
[45:53] do that the best that we
[45:55] can so
[45:57] uh I mean it's really been an honor
[45:59] having brother Joe to be with us this

[54:11] honored to meet you I I believe this
[54:14] morning that one day we'll sit down by

[54:23] led us and brought us and dealt with our
[54:26] hearts and it'll be a wonderful time
[54:28] amen when we get to the other side so
[54:31] may God bless you this morning and greet
[54:33] you from our assembly back home Bible
[54:35] Tabernacle Church and the Big Town of
[54:38] Roose North Carolina we have one traffic
[54:41] light uh you know I don't know what you

[54:46] it's just uh just amazes me all the
[54:49] crossing and and bridges and everything
[54:52] is just just wonderful amen but
[54:55] technology of man is just just great to
[54:58] our benefit this morning amen but it can
[55:01] be detrimental amen but we we just thank
[55:03] God for his mercies and we are a
[55:06] mission-minded
[55:07] church I was sharing with Brother Juan
[55:10] yesterday a little bit of of the vision
[55:13] that we've had over the years my dad
[55:15] started the church in the early 60s
[55:18] under the direction of the Lord he was
[55:21] pastoring a a group we we will you bear
[55:24] with me just a moment this morning I'm
[55:25] going to be standing standing for a
[55:26] little while so I'll let you stand for a
[55:28] moment amen uh dad was pastoring another
[55:33] church and the Lord spoke to him to
[55:34] leave that a thriving church maybe 300
[55:38] people uh radio broadcasts mission trips
[55:42] doing very well there but he just
[55:45] desired more from the Lord and he called
[55:48] a fast and solemn assembly and prayed
[55:51] for a couple of three days and sought
[55:54] the Lord and the Lord spoke to him to
[55:55] leave them there and come to Ruth and
[55:58] build a church for the common people and
[56:01] uh he set in
[56:02] practice uh by following that
[56:05] instruction he set in practice some
[56:07] instructions that brother branam had
[56:10] given to his Pastor brother Glenn pardon
[56:12] in
[56:14] 1956 to uh go and come to the mission
[56:18] fields of the world and the church would
[56:20] be a support or a backlog for the
[56:23] missionary efforts so dad caught that
[56:26] Vision brother Parton failed to do it
[56:29] and dad caught that vision and and uh
[56:31] ran with it as we say and uh by God's
[56:35] grace the rest is history uh dad and
[56:38] brother Dan uh preached all around the
[56:40] world and and India and Africa and the
[56:45] Canary Islands Philippine islands all
[56:47] the Caribbean islands
[56:49] Mexico uh Honduras Central America dad
[56:52] and brother Dan took a pickup truck from
[56:55] North Carolina Ina Brother Juan drove it
[56:57] all the way down to Honduras all the way
[57:00] through Mexico and whatever countries
[57:02] down through there to get to hondurus
[57:04] for our little brother a missionary
[57:06] brother there and and I left it with him
[57:09] and uh it's just it's just so many
[57:11] things to to to relate this morning but
[57:14] we're just happy to be a servant of the
[57:17] most high God Amen so may God bless you
[57:20] this morning if you ever run of out out
[57:23] of anything to pray for pray for us amen
[57:26] because we desire amen the the
[57:29] leadership of the Lord and we desire the
[57:31] prayers of the people brother renam uh
[57:33] he said you know a couple of times and
[57:36] maybe more than a couple of times but he
[57:38] said attribute the success of my people
[57:41] to these two brothers as he pointed to
[57:43] them said that their prayers amen is
[57:46] what holds us up and what encourages us
[57:48] and I I believe this morning that the
[57:50] prayers of the Saints they hold more
[57:52] value than we realize they do this
[57:54] morning amen so may God bless you
[57:58] greetings from my wife she wanted to
[57:59] come but uh due to circumstances her
[58:02] health and so forth she wasn't able to
[58:04] make the trip so I just felt in my heart
[58:07] to ask with Eric to travel with me and I
[58:09] sure appreciate him coming this morning
[58:12] amen he's he's most of the time very
[58:14] quiet until he gets in the pull pit and
[58:17] then uh I think brother ju his first
[58:19] sermon uh 31 years ago or 32 years ago
[58:23] before my dad passed away was was 50 1
[58:26] minutes long his first sermon amen so
[58:29] brother Eric I sure appreciate him and
[58:32] his support there in the church he's
[58:34] he's the one I call on most of the time
[58:36] when I need an emergency preacher amen
[58:40] so he's he's always willing and ready so
[58:42] we do appreciate that amen as you find
[58:46] your place in the scripture in Luke
[58:48] chapter
[58:49] 1 we'll just bow our hearts this morning
[58:52] for a word of
[58:54] prayer precious father this morning God

[59:45] important thing that's brought him here
[59:48] is the word of God and I pray this
[59:50] morning Lord God that you would just
[59:52] help me today God to step aside and Lord
[59:56] to yield my vessel to you that you Lord

[1:00:07] to to be sensitive to the leading of the
[1:00:11] spirit this morning God as we spoke last
[1:00:14] night and shared Lord the the the little
[1:00:17] things that you've placed within our
[1:00:20] heart and we're just going to continue
[1:00:22] in that train of thought this morning by
[1:00:23] your grace and I pray you just help help
[1:00:26] us father to to be a blessing God as as

[1:00:39] cross the deep blue sea and God that's

[1:02:20] direction but before we got here but
[1:02:23] then as the service went last night I
[1:02:25] just
[1:02:26] feel to continue with that this morning
[1:02:29] and if you weren't here uh I spoke your

[1:02:35] conclusion and you know we all deal with
[1:02:38] conditions we all deal with
[1:02:40] circumstances in life amen but that's
[1:02:44] not the
[1:02:45] outcome that's just the condition amen
[1:02:49] and if we if we take this morning and
[1:02:53] realize that even in our
[1:02:56] conditions the mercy of the Lord is on
[1:02:59] them that fear Him from generation to

[1:04:05] lot of people in church when when the
[1:04:07] word is going forth and there's

[1:04:13] Pitchfork
[1:04:15] Christians you know you farmer takes the
[1:04:17] Pitchfork and he moves the hay around

[1:19:35] Green brother Ram said put your name in

[1:20:04] written
[1:20:06] amen we have to find our promise so that
[1:20:11] we can release our faith amen that our
[1:20:15] condition is not our
[1:20:18] conclusion amen now uh you forgive me
[1:20:21] this morning if you think I'm just
[1:20:24] harping on that too much but I I believe
[1:20:27] with all of my heart amen that God
[1:20:30] doesn't want us Amen to be raggy run
[1:20:34] down worn
[1:20:36] out people well brother Joel I wish
[1:20:39] you'd give me a scripture for that I'm
[1:20:41] so glad you asked me to Jude tells us
[1:20:44] amen beloved I would above all things
[1:20:48] that thou mayest prosper and be in
[1:20:51] health even as your soul prospers ERS
[1:20:55] amen so the main thing this morning is
[1:20:58] make sure your soul is prospering amen
[1:21:01] and then let God take care of the rest
[1:21:03] of these things
[1:21:06] amen 2 Timothy
[1:21:09] 3:16 all scripture is given by
[1:21:13] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[1:21:17] Doctrine for reproof for correction for
[1:21:21] instruction in righteousness that the
[1:21:25] man of God may be perfect thly furnished
[1:21:30] unto all good works now a lot of people
[1:21:34] read that thoroughly furnished but it's
[1:21:37] not thoroughly it's thly Amen in other
[1:21:41] words in other words you've got to
[1:21:44] realize amen that that no matter what
[1:21:47] the circumstance no matter what the
[1:21:49] situation God's word has the remedy this
[1:21:52] morning amen that word inspiration
[1:21:56] taking it back to the the the
[1:21:59] concordance and looking up the
[1:22:01] definition amen it's the
[1:22:04] opostos and I'm not no Greek scholar so
[1:22:08] uh just bear with my pronunciation there
[1:22:11] amen but it means divinely breathe in
[1:22:16] amen so the word of God is divinely
[1:22:19] breathe in amen holy men of old wrote as
[1:22:23] they were in ins ired of God Amen as as
[1:22:27] God breathed into them these words this
[1:22:30] morning they wrote it down and we have
[1:22:32] it here that we can tap in to that
[1:22:36] inspiration tap in to that Breath of God
[1:22:39] this morning amen and and let that word
[1:22:42] come alive in our soul in our Our Lives
[1:22:47] this morning Amen to bring a
[1:22:49] manifestation now it also goes back to
[1:22:52] another Greek word which is the
[1:22:55] amen of certain or uncertain Affinity
[1:22:59] they they don't know exactly the origin
[1:23:02] of it but a deity and especially Amen to
[1:23:06] the Supreme Divinity amen figuratively a
[1:23:10] magistrate and there's no greater
[1:23:12] magistrate or judge than almighty God
[1:23:15] this morning amen so it's it's exceeding
[1:23:19] amen abundantly that God would bless you
[1:23:22] this morning amen now
[1:23:26] again not thoroughly but thly and that
[1:23:30] word
[1:23:31] thly amen taking back to the original XR
[1:23:36] d tzo uh e x a r t i d zo zo amen it
[1:23:43] says to equip to accomplish or
[1:23:47] thoroughly furnish now I want you to
[1:23:50] realize this morning God has not left us
[1:23:53] amen with without equipment to fight
[1:23:56] this battle amen he's given us a
[1:23:59] two-edged sword that cuts coming and
[1:24:02] going this morning amen and if we in our
[1:24:05] faith amen apply the word of God to our
[1:24:09] situations of life let me tell you there
[1:24:12] is no weapon that's formed against you
[1:24:15] that shall prosper because the word of
[1:24:18] God covers every Avenue of life this
[1:24:21] morning every sickness every disease
[1:24:24] every problem every trial that we go
[1:24:27] through let me tell you there is a verse
[1:24:30] here amen that will cut the head off of
[1:24:32] that devil this morning amen if we'll
[1:24:35] just take the sword of the word and
[1:24:37] apply it amen a lot of people have the
[1:24:40] sword but they don't know how to use it
[1:24:43] amen but I thank God for the message
[1:24:45] this morning it has showed us how to
[1:24:48] wield that sword it has showed us when
[1:24:51] to use it amen when the devil raises his
[1:24:54] head
[1:24:54] will the
[1:24:56] sword
[1:24:59] hallu
[1:25:01] now going back to the prayer that
[1:25:03] Hezekiah prays in 2 Kings 20 verses 2
[1:25:08] and three he appeals to God as a son who
[1:25:14] has not finished his work and bends on
[1:25:17] the grace of his father to Grant him the
[1:25:21] time that is needed to be become
[1:25:25] complete in him now he had a work to do
[1:25:28] he had something he needed to finish and
[1:25:31] when God sent the the prophet to tell
[1:25:33] him set your house in order you're going
[1:25:35] to
[1:25:36] die Hezekiah turned his face to the wall
[1:25:40] and he began to pray he began to call
[1:25:43] out to God God I i' I've served you all
[1:25:46] these years I've walked in the precepts
[1:25:49] of your word amen I I I've done what the
[1:25:51] prophet has told me and Lord I've got
[1:25:54] this situation I need I feel I need to
[1:25:56] to complete it Lord grant me some more
[1:25:59] time and listen before the prophet got
[1:26:02] out the courtyard God spoke to him go
[1:26:05] back and tell him I've added to his life
[1:26:08] 15 years now we know at the end of that
[1:26:12] he went astray and so forth but his
[1:26:15] prayer changed the mind of
[1:26:19] God now prayer won't change his word
[1:26:25] but it it can affect your
[1:26:31] situation
[1:26:33] amen
[1:26:34] now take note this
[1:26:37] morning
[1:26:40] Hezekiah was told set your house in
[1:26:42] order you are going to
[1:26:45] die can you imagine a death
[1:26:50] sentence but his faith was such that
[1:26:54] that didn't bother him he asked God for
[1:26:58] some more
[1:26:59] time it didn't hinder his faith to
[1:27:03] believe that God could give him more
[1:27:06] time Lord it was a condition but it was
[1:27:11] not the conclusion it was a circumstance
[1:27:15] but it wasn't the end of the matter it
[1:27:18] wasn't the conclusion because God added
[1:27:21] to his time 15 years amen and now I want

[1:28:53] or anything I'm just making an
[1:28:55] illustration you know we we and and

[1:29:06] I've ever seen in all my life of living

[1:29:19] know living the life amen he had a
[1:29:21] high-paying job a good family and all
[1:29:23] that but overnight or through

[1:29:28] situation amen but you know this morning
[1:29:30] in this land of
[1:29:34] opportunity you don't have to stay there
[1:29:37] that's a condition but it don't have to
[1:29:39] be the conclusion this morning amen you
[1:29:42] folks maybe I know some of you maybe
[1:29:44] came through some War torn countries and
[1:29:47] so forth amen that was a condition but
[1:29:50] you didn't stay there you changed it and
[1:29:53] now here you are with a different
[1:29:55] conclusion this morning amen oh I tell
[1:29:58] you the saints of God don't you realize
[1:30:01] amen that we a as the people of God Amen
[1:30:05] we have been given every
[1:30:10] opportunity

[1:30:20] the
[1:30:21] lawyer or the bill collector don't don't
[1:30:24] base your faith in that this
[1:30:27] morning recognize amen that they're
[1:30:30] presenting to you a condition just like
[1:30:34] we spoke last night of sister Connor
[1:30:36] amen you know up in years and the doctor
[1:30:40] told her just to be basically honest
[1:30:43] with you TR truly honest with you it was
[1:30:45] breast cancer the doctor said your
[1:30:48] sisters have died three or four sisters
[1:30:50] I forget with this condition and you
[1:30:52] know you have it now and she looked at
[1:30:55] the doctor and said bless God I wouldn't
[1:30:57] have the low down
[1:31:03] devil she didn't sign for that box of
[1:31:07] rattlesnakes she didn't accept it she
[1:31:10] said no sir I'm not having it I will not
[1:31:13] accept it amen and listen she lived on
[1:31:16] up into her 90s amen rejoicing and
[1:31:19] praising God Amen because she didn't
[1:31:22] accept what the devil tried to give her
[1:31:25] listen this morning amen you don't have
[1:31:28] to accept it either you don't have to

[1:31:41] have it too no no no no no the power of
[1:31:44] your tongue taking the word of God can
[1:31:47] say like sister Connor I won't have that
[1:31:50] low down devil I refuse to accept it
[1:31:53] that was them that's not me this morning
[1:31:55] because I believe what the word of God
[1:31:59] said by his strip I am

[1:32:26] we don't have to accept that condition
[1:32:30] and the conclusion of a condition that
[1:32:33] they have have put a a label on a devil
[1:32:37] but we don't have to accept that devil
[1:32:39] this morning amen God says in his word
[1:32:42] the king's heart is in the hand of the
[1:32:46] Lord as the rivers of water he turneth
[1:32:49] it withs soever he will I want you to
[1:32:53] recognize this morning we are not in the
[1:32:56] hands of a doctor we are in the hands of
[1:32:59] almighty God Amen we are in the hands of
[1:33:03] the promises of the word of God this
[1:33:05] morning amen and God directs your path
[1:33:08] amen as we read last not Jeremiah 29:11

[1:33:34] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:33:38] man availeth much now what we've got to
[1:33:42] do this morning is to condition ourself
[1:33:46] to pray
[1:33:48] effectually now how many knows what
[1:33:50] effectually
[1:33:52] means effectually means sufficient to
[1:33:56] produce a
[1:33:58] result amen so we have to come to that
[1:34:01] place brother the one to where we take
[1:34:03] God at his word and we begin to pray
[1:34:07] effectually sufficiently amen Faithfully
[1:34:12] in faith believing amen that what we are
[1:34:15] asking God for what we are telling him
[1:34:18] he said in his word amen will apply in
[1:34:22] our lives amen and it will manifest in
[1:34:25] our lives this morning amen uh the
[1:34:28] result will come this morning
[1:34:33] amen you know I know probably you've
[1:34:38] heard of our dear friend brother Ron
[1:34:40] Spencer how many's heard of brother Ron
[1:34:43] Amen brother Ron spoke our missionary
[1:34:46] meeting in
[1:34:48] 2019 he left there went home and began
[1:34:52] to deal with some situ situations
[1:34:54] physically and ended up toward the end
[1:34:57] of the year the doctors told him Mr
[1:34:59] Spencer you have cancer of the brain
[1:35:03] amen of of the the lungs and of your
[1:35:06] lymph nodes amen and before that brother
[1:35:10] Ron had the Lord to speak to him and say
[1:35:14] if you will trust me I will use you like
[1:35:17] never before now I want you to realize
[1:35:20] this morning he didn't know what was
[1:35:22] about to happen he didn't know what was
[1:35:24] fixing to take place he didn't know he
[1:35:27] was fixing to get uh such a death
[1:35:29] sentence listen now amen uh the doctors
[1:35:33] gave him at that point amen two to three
[1:35:36] months to
[1:35:37] live 2019 that's five years
[1:35:43] ago he's preaching this morning
[1:35:48] [Applause]
[1:35:54] he's following the doctor's advice he's
[1:35:56] taking the chemo amen he's doing what
[1:35:59] they tell him to do he's having all the
[1:36:00] skins and the test amen but his trust is
[1:36:03] not in the doctor's ability because the
[1:36:06] doctor said three to four 2 three 4
[1:36:09] months you'll be
[1:36:12] dead they told him here just recently if
[1:36:15] you you know they they they keep asking
[1:36:17] him how long Mr Spencer do you want to
[1:36:20] continue fighting he said I'll never
[1:36:23] give
[1:36:25] up I have confidence that God told me
[1:36:29] trust me and I'll use you like never
[1:36:31] before even through all of this his
[1:36:34] testimony is strong he's still preaching
[1:36:36] amen he he doesn't let this condition
[1:36:40] amen hold him back amen he's he's in
[1:36:43] fact he's going this weekend up to to
[1:36:45] Saskatoon to preach for brother Kelly
[1:36:47] hilderbrand or this coming weekend amen
[1:36:50] a meeting there amen and that's that's
[1:36:52] his plans amen and and I saw him
[1:36:55] Thursday evening at a wedding in
[1:36:57] Virginia amen and and he looks good to
[1:37:00] look at him you wouldn't think there's a
[1:37:02] thing wrong with him amen but but you
[1:37:05] know I've been with him when he's sick
[1:37:06] I've been with him when he's throwing up
[1:37:08] all over the place amen because of the
[1:37:10] the medication and all that he's dealing
[1:37:12] with amen but his confidence is this is
[1:37:16] a condition but it is not my conclusion
[1:37:20] it's not what how the devil is going to
[1:37:22] take me out of here amen and the devil
[1:37:24] cannot do anything to me unless God
[1:37:27] gives him
[1:37:29] permission his testimony is the devil
[1:37:31] wants to kill me but he ain't got
[1:37:35] enough because I'm still here the doctor
[1:37:39] said amen two three months but five
[1:37:42] years later he's still carrying the
[1:37:44] torch amen we have a sister in our
[1:37:47] church amen has a similar situation
[1:37:50] finding cancer the doctors when she was
[1:37:52] first diagnosed told her she had three
[1:37:54] to four days I believe it was wasn't
[1:37:57] brother Eric amen that she wouldn't live
[1:38:00] that's been nearly six months
[1:38:05] ago well brother Joe what are you trying
[1:38:08] to say it's a condition it's not a
[1:38:12] conclusion amen it is something that we
[1:38:16] have to take the word of God and believe
[1:38:19] what he said amen now
[1:38:23] and I said that to get to this point we
[1:38:27] have to come expecting a positive
[1:38:33] outcome it said that expectation is the
[1:38:37] breeding ground for
[1:38:39] miracles amen Hezekiah didn't just pray
[1:38:42] to hear himself pray amen he didn't pray
[1:38:46] amen like so many do this this morning
[1:38:49] you know we sat down to eat and God is
[1:38:51] great God is good just a simple prayer
[1:38:53] just to say that we said our prayer over
[1:38:55] our lunch amen that's not it he prays
[1:38:59] diligently amen he prays expecting this
[1:39:02] morning and we as Believers amen we
[1:39:06] ought not to just you know
[1:39:10] the a lot of people they say well say a
[1:39:14] prayer I don't believe in saying a
[1:39:20] prayer now I lay me down to sleep
[1:39:23] I pray the Lord my soul to keep how many
[1:39:26] children have said that prayer how many
[1:39:30] parents have taught that to their
[1:39:32] children and that that's okay you're
[1:39:34] teaching them the value of prayer amen
[1:39:37] but when you get an understanding don't
[1:39:40] repeat a
[1:39:44] prayer that's not diligently seeking God
[1:39:48] that's not diligently amen coming to God
[1:39:52] with EXP expectation it's just a
[1:40:00] habit anybody
[1:40:04] home are are you still with me this
[1:40:06] morning amen I i' I've got a long ways
[1:40:08] home so let me you know don't don't shut
[1:40:11] me off just
[1:40:14] yet
[1:40:16] amen
[1:40:18] diligence expecting what you're asking
[1:40:22] God for to have happened amen now listen
[1:40:27] Hezekiah didn't know when God would
[1:40:31] answer but he knew it had to be before
[1:40:35] he
[1:40:37] died amen if he had died he' know that
[1:40:42] God was answer was
[1:40:44] no but if God restored his life he would
[1:40:49] have said God said yes hallelujah praise
[1:40:52] God thank God I'm going to live live a
[1:40:53] little bit longer
[1:40:56] amen had to come before he died but I
[1:41:00] want you to
[1:41:02] realize only as God can do he gives
[1:41:06] answers before you're doing your
[1:41:09] praying I I was relating on the way back
[1:41:12] to the room last night with brother ju
[1:41:14] in the car you know my dad was he was
[1:41:18] just an old country boy he left to trade
[1:41:21] and you know trade p knives and rifles
[1:41:25] and and and cars and what whatever he
[1:41:28] could make a little profit on to help
[1:41:31] some missionary or something so he loved
[1:41:35] to listen to the local radio station
[1:41:37] they had a program called swapping shop
[1:41:40] and in that program people would call in
[1:41:42] and say I've got something for sale so
[1:41:45] much money and here's my number and so
[1:41:48] forth so dad was listening one day and
[1:41:51] this gentleman come on there and he said
[1:41:54] I've got a a Martin guitar I want to
[1:41:56] sell now dad played the guitar a little
[1:41:59] bit and he'd had some different guitars
[1:42:01] over the years but he never had a Martin
[1:42:03] guitar and if you're familiar with
[1:42:05] guitars that's one of the better quality
[1:42:08] ones but he never could afford it never
[1:42:10] could afford to to buy a new one and so
[1:42:12] forth so so when he heard this guy his
[1:42:15] ears perked up and then the guy said I
[1:42:18] want $200 for this
[1:42:20] guitar now
[1:42:23] you just have to know my dad so he
[1:42:25] listened intently took the number down
[1:42:28] and and immediately called the gentleman
[1:42:30] and said you know what what have you got
[1:42:32] what kind of Martin guitar is it he said
[1:42:34] well it's a
[1:42:36] 1965 Martin d18 guitar amen so Dad said
[1:42:40] well where are you at and he took the
[1:42:43] address and he said don't talk to nobody
[1:42:45] else I'm on my way so he got in the car
[1:42:48] and he ran or drove rather to where the
[1:42:50] man was at and looked at it and and and
[1:42:53] the man said I want $200 for it Dad said
[1:42:56] I'll take it amen so he bought that
[1:42:58] guitar and and you know when he brought
[1:43:01] it home then he was sharing with me I
[1:43:03] played just a little bit and and and he
[1:43:05] was sharing it with me and oh it just
[1:43:07] had such a small neck and it Fred so
[1:43:09] well played so well and and I I tried my
[1:43:12] best daddy trade with me let me let me
[1:43:15] have that one and he said no son said
[1:43:16] I've always wanted one and and couldn't
[1:43:19] afford it so God has blessed me with
[1:43:21] this and said when I'm gone on I I'll
[1:43:24] make sure that it's in the wheel that
[1:43:25] you get it I said oh all right
[1:43:29] daddy disappointed like many of us are
[1:43:32] when God don't give us exactly what we
[1:43:34] want when we want it amen but he said
[1:43:38] it's yours when I'm gone said okay so
[1:43:42] few months went by and I stopped by to
[1:43:44] see him after work one day Mom was
[1:43:47] working at the time and and she hadn't
[1:43:49] got home yet and he said hang around
[1:43:51] till Mom gets here I got something for
[1:43:53] for you so when Mom come
[1:43:56] in he said let's let's go in the bedroom
[1:43:59] here so we went in the bedroom there and
[1:44:01] on the bed lay two Martin guitar cases
[1:44:05] he opened them up he said this is this
[1:44:09] is the one son that I promised you when
[1:44:11] I am gone that you can have this guitar
[1:44:15] and said this is one after after I told
[1:44:19] you that he said I knew I wouldn't get
[1:44:21] to see you play it and enjoy it if I
[1:44:24] waited till I was gone so he said
[1:44:27] I went down to the local music store and
[1:44:31] I laid one away and I made payments on
[1:44:34] it until I could get it out and he said
[1:44:36] now this one is yours and this one is
[1:44:38] mine and we both have one I said praise
[1:44:41] the Lord my inheritance has come early I
[1:44:44] want you to realize this morning that
[1:44:47] all of these promises of God are our
[1:44:50] inheritance and we don't have to wait
[1:44:52] because our our testator amen he has
[1:44:56] already died and he left this to us
[1:44:59] tonight he's already given it to us in
[1:45:02] his will amen thank God and we don't
[1:45:05] have to wait any longer it's already
[1:45:08] ours amen but the story don't end there
[1:45:11] after Dad went home to be with the Lord
[1:45:13] mom called me in and said son you know I
[1:45:15] know the story behind your guitar amen
[1:45:18] and here's this other Martin said I want
[1:45:20] you to have it too so guess what amen I
[1:45:23] enjoyed the benefits of my inheritance
[1:45:26] and then I got a greater inheritance on
[1:45:28] top of that so now I have two Martin
[1:45:32] guitars amen oh I tell you this morning
[1:45:34] don't you realize it hadn't even entered
[1:45:37] into the heart of man the things that
[1:45:39] God has prepared for those that love him
[1:45:42] amen so the blessing we enjoy here just
[1:45:45] wait amen as brother juel thorny sings a
[1:45:48] song won't it be a time amen I'm going
[1:45:51] to look at my head and my hands looked
[1:45:54] new I looked at my feets and my feets
[1:45:56] did too I looked all around and all
[1:45:59] around did Shine thank God we've got
[1:46:02] that to look forward to this morning
[1:46:04] that's
[1:46:05] right that's right
[1:46:13] amen Hezekiah was not the only one that
[1:46:17] conditions or that had conditions as you
[1:46:20] check the Bible amen and they had
[1:46:24] expectation that their conclusion would
[1:46:27] be great what is
[1:46:30] expectation it's nothing more than
[1:46:32] having faith to believe God for a
[1:46:37] testimony amen do you realize that a
[1:46:41] testimony cannot be had unless there is
[1:46:44] a
[1:46:46] test amen unless you go through
[1:46:49] something this morning you can't testify
[1:46:52] of how God brought you out
[1:46:56] amen unless I had been without a job as
[1:47:00] I referred to last night I couldn't have
[1:47:02] had that testimony of what God did for
[1:47:05] me amen and and he told me what if I
[1:47:10] what if I prepared this for you amen and
[1:47:14] and and such a a great thing in my mind
[1:47:17] Amen in my thinking I'm just so grateful
[1:47:20] for what God has provided this morning
[1:47:24] amen now as we said expectation is
[1:47:27] nothing more than having faith in God
[1:47:31] Amen to to believe God for your
[1:47:34] testimony Revelation 12:1 tells us and
[1:47:38] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:47:41] lamb and the word of their
[1:47:45] testimony amen and they love not their
[1:47:48] lives unto the death it doesn't matter
[1:47:52] amen man because they they knew God was
[1:47:55] going to bring them through they didn't
[1:47:57] know how they didn't know when they
[1:48:00] didn't know what the circumstances would
[1:48:02] be but they had faith in God that he
[1:48:05] would bring them through this morning
[1:48:10] amen overcoming conditions by the blood
[1:48:13] of the lamb and Romans
[1:48:17] 4:17 and calling those things which be
[1:48:21] not as though they were
[1:48:23] I mentioned last night one my three
[1:48:26] sisters that worked in the pharmacy with
[1:48:28] me amen the one sister my eldest sister
[1:48:31] amen she she would come by and she would
[1:48:34] be going through some struggles of life
[1:48:36] and situations she didn't know what to
[1:48:38] do and and you know we would we would
[1:48:40] just right there in my little office we
[1:48:42] would agree and pray and that just ask
[1:48:45] God to move in the
[1:48:47] situation and and you know I would I
[1:48:49] would remind her amen your faith
[1:48:53] is the bridge that you walk on until God
[1:48:56] brings the bridge into reality your
[1:49:00] faith in God Amen is what brings the
[1:49:03] solution to your troubles until it's
[1:49:07] manifested Amen so as we quoted last
[1:49:10] night as well faith is the substance of
[1:49:13] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[1:49:17] Not Seen amen so we realize our faith
[1:49:21] amen and listen what what did Brother
[1:49:23] ROM tell us real
[1:49:26] faith says it's already
[1:49:33] done it it's already
[1:49:35] completed it's already accomplished so
[1:49:39] as we referred to last night amen we are
[1:49:42] already in that other
[1:49:45] dimension in our theophanies but what
[1:49:48] we've got to do is have faith that God's
[1:49:51] going to bring this flesh
[1:49:53] amen and change it and move it into that
[1:49:57] theophany state this morning
[1:50:01] amen
[1:50:07] now as we kind of wind down this
[1:50:12] morning we got to realize our
[1:50:16] conclusion is
[1:50:18] not based upon the condition
[1:50:24] right our our no matter what our
[1:50:28] condition may be it is not the
[1:50:31] conclusion now I know we have to have
[1:50:33] the condition to get the conclusion I
[1:50:36] know we have to have the circumstance
[1:50:38] the trial the test to come out a winner
[1:50:41] on the other side but I I I want you to
[1:50:44] realize what the word has
[1:50:46] declared we are more than conquerors
[1:50:50] through him that loved us and and gave
[1:50:53] himself for us amen there is nowhere in
[1:50:58] the scripture that God refers to us as
[1:51:05] losers God calls us
[1:51:08] Overcomers amen and he said in in the
[1:51:12] Book of Revelation there to him that
[1:51:15] overcometh eth that is continually
[1:51:20] overcomes let me tell you this morning
[1:51:24] in
[1:51:25] life we have
[1:51:29] trials well maybe maybe you all don't
[1:51:32] have the problems we have on the East
[1:51:34] Coast maybe you all are living Angelic
[1:51:37] lives and everything's just Blissful and
[1:51:39] happy and no worries no
[1:51:42] problems N I don't think
[1:51:45] so don't fool
[1:51:48] yourself amen Paul said you be as I am
[1:51:51] for I am as you are if we got problems
[1:51:54] on the East Coast you got problem up
[1:51:56] here in the Midwest amen and and you
[1:51:59] know what we got to do is recognize it's
[1:52:02] just
[1:52:04] conditions it's just
[1:52:06] circumstances but it's not the
[1:52:09] conclusion amen because the conclusion
[1:52:12] is amen that we fear God we keep his
[1:52:16] Commandments and we know that he will
[1:52:20] not lose one of his own
[1:52:23] amen and he with every Temptation every
[1:52:26] test every trial he has already made a
[1:52:30] way of Escape amen now your condition
[1:52:34] may be drugs and and I pray that that's
[1:52:37] none here maybe alcohol again I pray
[1:52:40] none here it may be smoking maybe
[1:52:42] drinking amen uh it may be sex it may be
[1:52:46] lust it may be pain it may be abuse
[1:52:49] whatever your condition this morning
[1:52:51] that is not not the
[1:52:54] conclusion amen it may
[1:52:57] [Applause]
[1:52:59] be it may be some Doctrine that's going
[1:53:02] around that's trying to deceive you and
[1:53:04] draw you away from the balance of the
[1:53:07] message listen this morning friend this
[1:53:10] message is
[1:53:14] balanced amen so many men my brother
[1:53:17] have tried to to lean it this way
[1:53:21] they've tried to lean it that way
[1:53:23] they've tried to add their
[1:53:24] interpretation to the interpreted word
[1:53:27] of God I'd like to tell you the
[1:53:28] interpreted word has already been
[1:53:31] interpreted and it don't need another
[1:53:35] interpretation what we need to do amen
[1:53:38] you know that
[1:53:39] there's well let me say it this way what
[1:53:42] we need to do is get into the
[1:53:48] message hear what the prophet has said

[1:55:15] overcome all the fanaticism that went

[1:56:10] trust it I can't believe it I I I just
[1:56:12] don't see it anymore let me tell you

[1:56:18] devil amen we have been given a message

[1:56:34] you this morning friend amen there's
[1:56:36] things in this Bible that for thousands
[1:56:38] of years they couldn't find a record of
[1:56:40] but now they're finding a record Amen in
[1:56:44] archaeology and so forth they're seeing
[1:56:46] the things that were mentioned in the
[1:56:48] bible they're real amen they're finding
[1:56:51] archaeological records of it today but I

[1:57:15] in the notes I hope it's all right amen
[1:57:18] you know that Spirit that's behind that
[1:57:21] movement
[1:57:24] it is a bad
[1:57:27] Spirit there's there's some in our
[1:57:29] church that that they were they were you
[1:57:33] know encouraged to listen to certain
[1:57:35] certain men that that were giving their
[1:57:37] testimonies of why they left the message
[1:57:40] and so forth amen and as they begin to
[1:57:43] listen to that amen their testimony is
[1:57:46] that I felt the most awful Spirit coming
[1:57:48] out of
[1:57:49] that it wasn't a live Ministry but it
[1:57:52] was a a video amen and they said I felt
[1:57:55] the most awful ungodly Spirit coming out
[1:57:58] of that and said I quickly turned it off
[1:58:01] I said you did the right thing you
[1:58:03] didn't need to listen to it in the first
[1:58:07] place praise the
[1:58:10] Lord that ain't in the notes but I want
[1:58:14] you to understand this morning if that
[1:58:17] comes up on your your search amen about
[1:58:20] the message turn it off quickly
[1:58:23] because that it it's inspired of
[1:58:26] Hell to deceive men and women amen and
[1:58:31] try to get you distracted from the true
[1:58:34] events that has taken place in this hour
[1:58:38] amen as I telling brother one my dad
[1:58:42] amen and mom and my Uncle Albert and a
[1:58:45] lib amen they traveled all up and down
[1:58:47] the East Coast they heard Roberts and
[1:58:50] Cole and Allan and and the Jones and and
[1:58:53] and and and all the great preachers of
[1:58:56] the day anywhere they could hear orl
[1:58:59] Roberts and TL osbor they they heard all
[1:59:02] of them and were in the meetings and and
[1:59:05] and so forth and and and you know as
[1:59:09] they heard them preach and that you know
[1:59:11] they they preached what they knew what
[1:59:13] they understood amen but when brother
[1:59:15] mam came to Spindale in
[1:59:17] 1956 my dad and mom was there
[1:59:22] and dad said when whenever brother bham
[1:59:24] came through the door before he even
[1:59:27] said evening friends dad said I found
[1:59:30] myself just Weeping at the presence of
[1:59:33] God that was with brother brandom amen
[1:59:36] he said when I he said I hadn't felt
[1:59:38] that with Roberts and osbor and Thea
[1:59:41] Jones and and and you know all the Great
[1:59:44] Men all the great preachers of the day
[1:59:46] he said I never had that experience
[1:59:48] before but when that little man came
[1:59:50] through that door before before he said
[1:59:52] evening friends he said I I I was just
[1:59:55] so moved by the presence of God it
[1:59:58] wasn't that little Kentucky hillbilly it
[2:00:00] was the god that he represented it was
[2:00:03] the god that stood by his side amen and
[2:00:06] did the Miracles and did the sign that
[2:00:08] did the Wonders amen that's in that
[2:00:10] Pillar of Fire that's out in the picture
[2:00:12] there that God is what made such an
[2:00:15] impression this morning amen not to say
[2:00:17] that those other men weren't doing great
[2:00:19] works and and God was working through
[2:00:21] them him amen but there was something
[2:00:23] more with this little prophet of God
[2:00:26] Amen and from that time in April 1956
[2:00:30] from that time Dad started following the
[2:00:33] ministry of brother bam and started
[2:00:34] catching the Revelation amen and listen
[2:00:37] he believed it with all of his
[2:00:46] heart and his condition of being you
[2:00:49] know a manf follower if you will and and
[2:00:52] I don't say that disrespectfully because
[2:00:54] he never was connected with any
[2:00:56] denomination or organization thank God
[2:00:59] Amen he just felt that wasn't right and
[2:01:01] he didn't join up amen but he he he
[2:01:04] found something that was
[2:01:06] real and I want you to understand this
[2:01:08] morning this message is
[2:01:11] real amen it it's
[2:01:14] reality it's not some man-made theology
[2:01:17] or idea let me tell
[2:01:20] you you listen to the tapes and you hear
[2:01:23] brother manam talk about the scientific
[2:01:25] things and the the astronomical things
[2:01:28] and you know the the things from history
[2:01:32] a man with a seventh grade
[2:01:35] education had the knowledge and ability
[2:01:38] to put all those things together I'm
[2:01:41] here to tell you it wasn't his seventh
[2:01:42] grade
[2:01:43] education it was the inspiration of the
[2:01:46] Holy Ghost the inspiration of this
[2:01:49] message that had to bring the loose ends
[2:01:52] together to bring it all to a point Amen
[2:01:56] to where we could see that that
[2:01:58] condition wasn't our conclusion this
[2:02:01] morning amen we're the condition of
[2:02:04] denomination it wasn't our conclusion
[2:02:07] the condition of church entity it wasn't
[2:02:10] our conclusion the CH the condition of
[2:02:13] religiosity that wasn't our conclusion

[2:02:19] come out of her my people and we are
[2:02:22] separate sayith the Lord amen that we
[2:02:24] have been called out Amen to be called
[2:02:26] in to the body of Christ this morning

[2:02:54] conclusion it's just a trick of the
[2:02:56] enemy to make you feel that you'll
[2:02:58] always be bound by your
[2:03:01] condition amen remember God said through
[2:03:04] the mouth of the Apostle
[2:03:06] Paul 2 Corinthians 4:17 for our light
[2:03:11] Affliction which is but for a
[2:03:14] moment it worketh for

[2:03:28] understand amen the afflictions that
[2:03:31] Paul is SPO speaking about there are
[2:03:35] conditions amen but but what they're
[2:03:39] doing is they're
[2:03:41] working a more
[2:03:43] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory

[2:04:47] that has some substance to it I'm
[2:04:50] looking for something that's real
[2:04:52] alive amen so one day as that little
[2:04:55] chicken grew or that little Eagle rather
[2:04:58] grew amen thinking he was a chicken
[2:05:01] being told he was a chicken being told

[2:05:41] scream out again come up high amen come
[2:05:45] up come a little deeper into the word

[2:06:18] live prey and he begins to rip the the
[2:06:21] meat and begins to eat it oh don't you

[2:06:26] to take the meat of the word amen and
[2:06:28] with our Holy Ghost speak began to rip
[2:06:30] it apart and to digest it this morning
[2:06:33] because we are eagles and not

[2:07:26] encourage you this morning set your
[2:07:28] wings in the promises of the word your
[2:07:31] condition amen is not your conclusion

[2:07:37] through the heights of the heavens amen
[2:07:39] without your effort amen it's just the
[2:07:41] wind of the Holy Ghost that's leading

[2:07:46] the word this morning
[2:07:49] amen oh I tell you Saints
[2:07:52] the more I look at this word the more I
[2:07:54] study it the more I realize it had to be
[2:07:57] God Amen the more I read the message it
[2:08:00] had to be God because there was a people
[2:08:04] that were called for his name's sake
[2:08:07] that needed that Heavenly Mana to come
[2:08:10] and strengthen them for that body
[2:08:13] change
[2:08:16] amen Moses had a condition he was a
[2:08:20] murderer he ran for his life amen he
[2:08:23] looked this way and he looked that way
[2:08:25] and when he saw that there's no man he
[2:08:26] slew the Egyptian and he hid him in the
[2:08:29] sand but then he went to the backs side
[2:08:31] of the desert and he had an experience
[2:08:34] with God after 40 years yes amen that's
[2:08:38] why we don't need to give up this
[2:08:39] morning we need to keep pressing we need
[2:08:41] to keep praying we need to keep
[2:08:43] believing for our family and our loved
[2:08:45] ones amen it was his condition but not
[2:08:48] his conclusion he became the Savior to
[2:08:51] the Jews use being an instrument to
[2:08:53] deliver them out of Egypt's bondage non
[2:08:57] had a condition he was a leper I'm
[2:08:59] trying to get it all in here this
[2:09:01] morning and I'm just about done amen but
[2:09:04] being a leper there was a little servant
[2:09:08] girl taken captive oh my it don't matter
[2:09:11] where you're at this morning you may be
[2:09:14] you know a servant girl you may work in

[2:09:20] the state C Capital you may be there but
[2:09:23] I want you to realize you're there for a
[2:09:24] reason as a daughter or son of God God
[2:09:28] has placed you just like I my testimony

[2:09:33] you God put me there for a reason amen
[2:09:36] that we might be a help to so many amen
[2:09:39] and and that that that man amen could be
[2:09:42] good to this member of the Bride maybe
[2:09:45] you know he never did see the message he
[2:09:47] never did understand how we could know
[2:09:50] all you people from different parts of
[2:09:52] the world Amen but you know I tried to
[2:09:55] tell him it's because of a message it's
[2:09:57] because of a word amen but you know
[2:09:59] brother one it may be what he done for
[2:10:02] me that gives him eternal life at the
[2:10:06] great judgment amen God may may say
[2:10:09] Henry Leonard it's your time to be
[2:10:11] judged and he'll come forth amen and you
[2:10:14] know just like we brother Brenham had
[2:10:17] the dream you know of going there and

[2:11:32] can be healed right now because you are
[2:11:34] healed the only thing the scripture
[2:11:37] would do would be a witness to say that

[2:11:41] would come tonight and give a great
[2:11:42] calling here and called out different
[2:11:45] people that wouldn't mean they were
