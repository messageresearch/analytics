[31:02] amen God bless you
[31:11] Hallelujah okay
[31:14] I don't like to stand here
[31:18] but I have a little word that came to me
[31:23] in a dream
[31:24] for the church
[31:27] and
[31:28] they are two actually
[31:30] one for the church
[31:32] and one for the body of Christ and the
[31:36] World At Large
[31:37] I mean you'll be thinking who is this
[31:40] guy that
[31:42] could get a word for the church or for
[31:45] the world
[31:47] God is fixing to do something in a mix
[31:55] but the word is please could you project
[31:58] John 13 verse 34 and 35.
[32:11] John 13
[32:13] 34 and 35.
[32:22] sorry if I if I'm taking a little a
[32:24] little bit more time
[32:30] I mean that scripture basically talks
[32:32] about okay so this Jesus is saying a new
[32:35] commandment I give unto you that ye love
[32:39] one another
[32:40] as I have loved you that he also loved
[32:44] one another verse 35 he says by this
[32:49] shall all men know that ye are my
[32:53] disciples
[32:56] if
[33:02] no way
[33:07] I mean I can come to you and
[33:10] smile at you and talk nice to you
[33:15] but the love comes here it comes from
[33:18] here
[33:19] not from the facial expression even
[33:22] though that's part of it
[33:28] in acts when it says
[33:30] um
[33:31] the uh the apostles before yeah before
[33:35] they were in due when they were gathered
[33:37] up in a in the upper room
[33:39] they were not just gathered together
[33:41] they were in what one are called
[33:45] I mean we could be a pup someone could
[33:48] be in a different state but we could be
[33:50] one Accord in spirit
[33:53] but we could be gathered here and be
[33:55] laughing and be joking and be smiling at
[33:58] each other but in our hearts we are far
[34:00] apart
[34:09] in the dream what what appeared to me
[34:12] was
[34:13] uh Siva was in the church
[34:16] and faces were shown me
[34:20] and when you first popped up
[34:22] your heart the condition the state of
[34:25] your heart appears to me like I could
[34:27] see it
[34:31] that hasn't happened to me a lot of
[34:33] times
[34:34] a few times
[34:37] and sometimes I could just
[34:39] buy not even a person saying something I
[34:42] could
[34:44] pick their
[34:46] what is happening inside of them
[34:50] what your heart is doing what your mind
[34:53] is doing what you are feeling badly I
[34:56] could pick that
[35:03] we should love one another
[35:11] you know this happened to me last month
[35:16] and when I was listening to brother who
[35:19] wants a sermon on I think last Sunday
[35:24] he picked on something
[35:27] and all through the the sermon when I
[35:30] was listening to him closely he touched
[35:32] on very Cardinal things we are not just
[35:35] cut it here we don't just walk through
[35:37] those doors and come in here to hear
[35:39] some sermon feel good and just go home
[35:44] God is working on our hearts
[35:47] that's what it brings us here for not to
[35:50] just hear some things that will make us
[35:52] feel good
[35:57] but if God can do anything Among Us
[36:00] it will be on the premise that we love
[36:03] one another
[36:07] I could have a word for you but if your
[36:09] health is not receptive of that word I
[36:12] could give it to you but it will not
[36:14] benefit you
[36:17] because the basis that
[36:20] the soil that that the word will thrive
[36:22] on is is the condition of your heart and
[36:25] that is the love
[36:30] I think the second one will come later
[36:32] God bless you
[36:45] let's bow his
[36:47] let's pray the Lord's Prayer together
[36:49] Our Father
[36:52] was in heaven
[36:54] Hallowed be thy name thy kid and come
[36:57] that will be done on Earth as it is in
[37:00] heaven
[37:00] give us this day our daily bread
[37:03] and forgive us our trespasses
[37:07] as he forgive those who trespass against
[37:09] us
[37:10] and lead us not into temptation but
[37:13] Deliver Us from all evil
[37:15] foreign
[37:19] forever and ever
[37:21] amen amen
[37:31] our attorney service over to the
[37:33] preacher in the little why
[37:35] but let me just uh
[37:41] encourage you
[37:42] and
[37:46] and uh
[37:49] you know
[37:51] like I've always said is it's amazing
[37:54] that we just
[37:57] spoke about gives
[37:59] in in this season
[38:02] and I'm sure that the Lord is wanting to
[38:05] deal with us and and use us
[38:09] but you see then
[38:11] we we have been given the word
[38:14] of the the
[38:16] problem with
[38:18] with the churches or Through the Ages is
[38:22] that if we don't do things I call into
[38:25] the order of God's word
[38:29] and we will be doing God a service and
[38:34] we'll be completely out of his will
[38:37] okay brother Brian gave us an order how
[38:41] to be in church and when to be in church
[38:44] that's that's where the whole thing
[38:46] begins from you know when we get to
[38:48] church and he says that uh 30 minutes
[38:52] time is when we come in and we wait on
[38:55] the Lord and uh you know and pray before
[38:59] the service and and many times we see
[39:02] people coming doing his song service
[39:04] right in the midst of the service and
[39:06] all of that but may God help each and
[39:08] every one of us praise the Lord and uh
[39:11] and like I've always said uh I told the
[39:15] the
[39:17] song leaders the deacons you know uh
[39:22] testimonies and those things they come
[39:24] before the song service you know we must
[39:26] do those things just before we get into
[39:29] worship
[39:30] because you see uh uh the the the spirit
[39:35] goes in the level you know and we go
[39:38] from one level to another another level
[39:40] get ourselves ready before the world
[39:43] comes
[39:45] so uh when we get things all mixed up
[39:49] then sometimes it affects the moving of
[39:52] the spirit
[39:53] we know that uh uh we have we have few
[39:57] of uh the scenes that are now feeling
[40:00] well and that call in this morning we
[40:04] will we will take those knees to the
[40:06] Lord in prayer and uh
[40:10] even this message we've been playing on
[40:14] uh
[40:16] part of prisoner you know brother
[40:18] Branham says the problem with the church
[40:21] is that you can go back and see that in
[40:23] the message that's one of the things
[40:24] that I will have commented from the
[40:26] message he says we term now to be
[40:30] sincere with the things that we believe
[40:34] you know we term not to be sincere with
[40:38] the things that we believe we have to
[40:40] realize that uh the commission given to
[40:44] the prophet and the bride is here to
[40:47] continue their commission it's a
[40:49] commission that is in contrainity if we
[40:52] will be sincere
[40:54] the angel of the law said not not even
[40:56] cancer we stand before our prayer
[41:00] and and then how many times that angel
[41:03] has told Brother Branham you know how
[41:06] sincere we ought to be now so you see we
[41:09] have we have all of these things we have
[41:11] all of these things and I'm I'm fully
[41:13] convinced and uh you know that God wants
[41:16] to deal with us God wants to use us but
[41:19] we have to do things I call into God's
[41:22] word
[41:23] we have to follow the word of God we
[41:25] have to follow the author that is given
[41:28] to us
[41:32] are we together
[41:34] praise the Lord
[41:35] so uh uh and and like I've always said
[41:39] with many of you brothers and sisters
[41:42] that have uh you know dreams and
[41:44] different things the right order there
[41:47] is for you to write those dreams down
[41:50] and and give it to me
[41:54] you know because uh if a word will be
[41:57] brought before the church we have to the
[42:00] like the like the Bible says we have to
[42:02] we have to look at those things we have
[42:04] to line it up with the word
[42:07] okay that's that is the order that is
[42:10] given to us
[42:12] praise the Lord
[42:14] [Music]
[42:16] now uh
[42:24] uh I don't know when brother brother uh
[42:27] I think brother decimal might have given
[42:29] that in the midst of the service
[42:31] but uh I just think that that
[42:35] being a wonderful world of admonishment
[42:39] for the church
[42:40] it came right in the mace of Praise that
[42:43] is completely out of order that's not
[42:45] the way it's supposed to be
[42:47] that's not the way it's supposed to be
[42:49] all of those things that's what the
[42:52] church denomination have got into
[42:54] trouble for
[42:55] we have an author
[42:57] [Music]
[43:00] and we must follow that other
[43:05] if we if we would be pleasing to God we
[43:08] must follow their order
[43:13] we don't make Church work it's the word
[43:16] of God that makes trust work
[43:18] Jesus said I'll bail my my church
[43:22] and the gifts of hell
[43:24] will not prevailed against it
[43:30] are we together
[43:34] let's buy our hearts and and take these
[43:37] few needs uh
[43:39] to the Lord
[43:41] and
[43:45] [Music]
[43:46] just allow me if you would just please
[43:48] uh
[43:50] play Reach Out And Touch the law for me
[43:53] [Music]

[1:01:08] amen before I go into the world I want
[1:01:12] to appreciate the pastor

[1:01:16] care of me so well may the Lord bless

[1:01:22] grammar and the children may the Lord
[1:01:25] reward you
[1:01:26] immensely beyond your aspirations also
[1:01:30] there have been people who have loved to
[1:01:32] take me out for lunch and so forth I
[1:01:34] heard about them I pray the Lord will
[1:01:36] even bless those intentions amen I'm
[1:01:40] also want to bring greetings from my
[1:01:42] family
[1:01:43] my wife and the children they said I
[1:01:46] should greet you all
[1:01:47] we know we are not strangers to one
[1:01:49] another if we didn't meet their owners
[1:01:52] definitely by the grace of God in the
[1:01:54] meeting in the year
[1:01:55] none of us will be missing
[1:01:57] amen also from the church my pastor and
[1:02:03] the rest of the team I do coming coming
[1:02:05] communicate with them and they have
[1:02:08] expressed their desire that I should
[1:02:10] send greetings unto you
[1:02:12] I hope they are acceptable to you
[1:02:14] God bless you I want to assure you that
[1:02:18] we are moving fine and all is going well
[1:02:21] this is God's program and there's
[1:02:23] nothing the enemy can do about it amen
[1:02:26] God's will be done regardless Hallelujah
[1:02:29] even in your life
[1:02:32] amen God bless you
[1:02:34] um let's rise up for the word
[1:02:39] turn the Bible to the Book of Ruth
[1:02:42] chapter one we are reading three verses
[1:02:45] The Book of Ruth chapter one
[1:02:49] from verse 15 to 18.
[1:02:54] four verses
[1:02:55] Ruth chapter 1 verses 15 to 18.
[1:03:01] is on the screen in case you are not
[1:03:03] there so I can start reading
[1:03:08] and she said
[1:03:09] Behold thy sister-in-law is gone back
[1:03:13] unto our people
[1:03:14] and unto our gods
[1:03:16] return Thou after thy sister-in-law
[1:03:21] and rude said
[1:03:23] in treatment on to leave them
[1:03:26] or to return from following afternoon
[1:03:30] for whether so ever that goeth I will go
[1:03:34] and we are thou largest I will Lodge
[1:03:37] thy people shall be my people
[1:03:40] and thy God my God
[1:03:43] where thou direst will I die and there
[1:03:46] will I be buried
[1:03:48] the Lord do so to me and more also
[1:03:52] if odd but death party and me
[1:03:56] when she saw that she was steadfastly
[1:03:59] minded to go with her
[1:04:01] then she left speaking onto her
[1:04:04] amen may the Lord have blessings to the
[1:04:06] Rene of his holy word
[1:04:07] you can please receive him
[1:04:11] once again God bless you
[1:04:13] and you are welcome to the house of the
[1:04:15] Lord
[1:04:16] this morning by the special grace of God
[1:04:20] we'll be looking at a sermon I titled
[1:04:23] decisions
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:28] we are this is an act that we all
[1:04:31] participating whether consciously or
[1:04:34] unconsciously
[1:04:35] I read that an average adult
[1:04:39] makes about 35
[1:04:41] 000 decisions every day
[1:04:44] so if you are an adult you make that
[1:04:46] decision consciously unconsciously even
[1:04:49] the decision to come to church today the
[1:04:52] kind of clothes you will wear where you
[1:04:55] will see it and everything they are all
[1:04:57] decisions
[1:04:58] amen and because of the significance of
[1:05:02] decisions in our life I felt that we
[1:05:05] need to know how to make those decisions
[1:05:08] Hallelujah
[1:05:09] the prophet preached about three sermons
[1:05:12] that specifically bothers on decision
[1:05:15] making
[1:05:17] he preached them time of decision
[1:05:20] power of decision and the result of
[1:05:22] decisions
[1:05:25] so I've collected those sermons and some
[1:05:28] others including choosing of a bride and
[1:05:30] the rest of them to to come up with this
[1:05:33] topic so I believe that by the grace of
[1:05:35] God at the end of it all we will know
[1:05:37] how to make our decisions amen because
[1:05:41] whether we like it or not we have to
[1:05:43] make decisions so it will be in our best
[1:05:46] interest to know how to go about it so
[1:05:48] that all the time we can make correct
[1:05:50] decisions
[1:05:51] Hallelujah
[1:05:53] so where we have read we read about
[1:05:56] sister Ruth who from account of the
[1:06:00] Bible she isn't even an Israelite
[1:06:03] she's from Moab
[1:06:05] praise the Lord I am if you remember the
[1:06:08] history of Moab
[1:06:09] Moab they are products of incest
[1:06:14] Moab is a son of lot
[1:06:17] by the daughter of lots
[1:06:20] Hallelujah I mean if you are good Bible
[1:06:23] readers you can go back to that I think
[1:06:25] in the Book of Genesis Maybe 19. so you
[1:06:29] can read about Lords and how Moab came
[1:06:31] into being so and it's kind of
[1:06:34] abomination in Israel for such a
[1:06:38] relationship to occur
[1:06:39] but Sister Rose I'm coming from that
[1:06:42] background we saw that Grace
[1:06:46] overlooks all such things Hallelujah so
[1:06:50] don't you can say oh my background it
[1:06:52] doesn't matter that's why Christ calls
[1:06:56] all
[1:06:57] amen and when Christ is calling all it
[1:07:00] does not matter who you are all you have
[1:07:03] to do is to yield to that call and your
[1:07:07] life will not remain the same
[1:07:09] Hallelujah
[1:07:10] so this sister Ruth is a product from
[1:07:13] such background but we saw that um she
[1:07:17] made a decision
[1:07:19] and then we see the procedure the way
[1:07:21] she did it and then today we cannot even
[1:07:24] talk about Christ especially his lineage
[1:07:27] without even talking about the same
[1:07:30] sister rules
[1:07:31] that's one of the importance of decision
[1:07:34] making
[1:07:35] Hallelujah
[1:07:37] from that story you can go back I think
[1:07:40] it's just about four chapters so I
[1:07:42] encourage you to read through them
[1:07:44] a man called elimelech
[1:07:47] who is from Bethlehem Judah and his wife
[1:07:51] Naomi
[1:07:52] we have sister Naomi here a wonderful
[1:07:55] sister God bless you
[1:07:57] so they've decided
[1:08:00] you know they were saying some action
[1:08:03] you know and that's why I believe us
[1:08:05] we don't live our ground
[1:08:09] your ground is not the United States of
[1:08:11] America your ground is the word of God
[1:08:14] hallelujah whatever you are doing in
[1:08:17] this life make sure it's within the
[1:08:18] context of the word
[1:08:20] that way God can back you up all the way
[1:08:24] halleluia but if you are doing your own
[1:08:26] will then you have to back yourself up I
[1:08:30] know man can help himself only God can
[1:08:32] help us
[1:08:33] so let's stay with the word
[1:08:36] amen so elimination Naomi they decided
[1:08:40] even though it's against the law of God
[1:08:43] for them to live their land
[1:08:45] because things are becoming summer
[1:08:49] so if things are hard today it's not the
[1:08:51] first time
[1:08:52] Solomon told us that there is nothing
[1:08:55] new Under the Sun
[1:08:57] if it's out today it has been had before
[1:08:59] and it will still be hard tomorrow but
[1:09:02] we have a promise that whatever it is we
[1:09:05] are more than conqueror through him that
[1:09:07] loved us
[1:09:09] so they decided to leave Bethlehem Judah
[1:09:11] for the land of Moab because the heart
[1:09:13] that things are moving down there that
[1:09:15] dollars are easier to make there
[1:09:18] so they moved Hallelujah and then the
[1:09:22] meaning of early Malik is worship
[1:09:26] means Pleasant so we have a pleasant
[1:09:30] worship
[1:09:31] moving from the land where they should
[1:09:33] be worshiping
[1:09:35] Hallelujah
[1:09:36] and then they give back to two children
[1:09:38] and Malon and chilon
[1:09:41] and the prophet unfortunately is said
[1:09:44] the meaning of Marlon and chillon is
[1:09:46] sickness and death
[1:09:48] so we wonder how can play some worship
[1:09:52] produce sickness and death
[1:09:55] you know maybe they are not correctly
[1:09:57] planted
[1:09:58] so we need to know we have to put in
[1:10:01] ourselves
[1:10:02] so now we can use correct fruits
[1:10:05] then in the course of time the worship
[1:10:09] died
[1:10:10] elimelech died in the land of Moab
[1:10:14] you know it looked like what's going on
[1:10:16] if you leave the word
[1:10:19] you know everything around Fellowship
[1:10:21] worship is very important I don't think
[1:10:24] we can over emphasize the importance of
[1:10:26] coming to church
[1:10:27] because it's part of the word Believers
[1:10:30] we're not coming to church it's a
[1:10:32] sacrifice and the more you give in to
[1:10:34] service the more you receive from it
[1:10:36] so let's be willing to do that I know
[1:10:39] God will bless you and you are doing
[1:10:40] that already
[1:10:42] so we saw in the eliminally died
[1:10:45] and then Naomi and our two sons they
[1:10:48] decided to take further step now the
[1:10:51] prophet told us I step into Aero without
[1:10:54] withdrawal leads to more steps into the
[1:10:57] error
[1:10:58] so if you notice we are making a mistake
[1:11:01] the first thing to do is to withdraw
[1:11:04] and then repent and correct your ways
[1:11:07] amen if you're correct on that part
[1:11:11] it can lead to God
[1:11:13] so they decided to marry the daughters
[1:11:15] of Moab
[1:11:17] which again the word of God said under
[1:11:20] no circumstantial a Believer marry a
[1:11:23] non-believer
[1:11:24] so they are broken two laws again now
[1:11:26] leaving the land and then marrying to
[1:11:29] the unbelievers
[1:11:31] and God is not responsible for that
[1:11:34] Hallelujah
[1:11:35] and so but God is saying everything
[1:11:38] and you see when we say the will of God
[1:11:41] will be done regardless there's nothing
[1:11:43] you do wherever you turn
[1:11:45] Bible said there is no divination
[1:11:48] nothing against God there is nothing
[1:11:51] this one that can be against God I can
[1:11:53] stand God will always have his way
[1:11:56] and that's why God's children is good to
[1:11:58] obey him
[1:11:59] because whether you like it or not is we
[1:12:02] will be done
[1:12:03] Hallelujah so let's get it done in the
[1:12:07] right way don't let us be dragged with
[1:12:09] arm and leg broken
[1:12:11] because we surely drag you in
[1:12:13] a man
[1:12:15] so they married these two sisters oppa
[1:12:18] and the rules
[1:12:22] is not even done with them he took the
[1:12:25] two sons away
[1:12:27] so Nami he said she said she went in
[1:12:31] full and came back empty
[1:12:33] he said the Lord was against her you
[1:12:36] know why if you read it you see that she
[1:12:37] was not saying it's God that was against
[1:12:39] her but she forgot that she ignored
[1:12:42] God's instruction before taking our
[1:12:45] decisions
[1:12:46] so he said oh the Lord that satisfied
[1:12:48] against me I'm left of the husband my
[1:12:51] two sons everybody is gone only me I'm
[1:12:54] left therefore let me go back to my base
[1:12:57] I think that's what she should have done
[1:12:59] earlier
[1:13:00] amen because when we see that we have
[1:13:03] made a mistake the person is to repent
[1:13:05] and get on the right track
[1:13:09] amen
[1:13:11] so she decided okay nothing to lose
[1:13:14] again I've lost all before I myself die
[1:13:17] let me run back
[1:13:19] Hallelujah she had the chance the others
[1:13:22] didn't have that chance
[1:13:23] and so that's why the word said today
[1:13:25] when you hear his voice hiding not your
[1:13:29] heart
[1:13:30] because you may not have tomorrow so why
[1:13:32] you have today make the best use of it
[1:13:35] amen
[1:13:37] so on our way back the two
[1:13:39] daughters-in-law decided to go with her
[1:13:42] oppa and Ruth and so she told them look
[1:13:47] the Lord has testified against me I mean
[1:13:50] there's nothing I have to offer you
[1:13:52] anymore your husbands are dead and
[1:13:55] myself I'm very old I can't if I ever
[1:13:57] give back today are you sure can you
[1:13:59] wait for the child to grow so there is
[1:14:01] no hope
[1:14:02] so just go back
[1:14:05] and the message was suiting to Hopper so
[1:14:08] she kissed her and left
[1:14:09] and then she was surprised Naomi that
[1:14:12] somebody was still standing and the
[1:14:14] person standing was Sister Rose say what
[1:14:17] what are you still doing
[1:14:18] your sister-in-law has gone back go away
[1:14:21] I have nothing for you and roots she's
[1:14:24] looked at the mother and I said look
[1:14:27] and treat me not to go back
[1:14:29] I have decided and that's why God is a
[1:14:33] topic decision
[1:14:36] halleluia she told her I have decided I
[1:14:41] am going with you
[1:14:43] amen your people they shall be my people
[1:14:46] those girls you told me to go back to
[1:14:49] I'm not going back there your own God
[1:14:51] will be my God hallelujah and you know
[1:14:55] she mentioned something
[1:14:56] you know we used to know that the
[1:14:58] greatest sacrifice is death
[1:15:01] there's nothing Beyond it
[1:15:03] she offered that look where you die
[1:15:06] there will I die and there will I be
[1:15:09] buried he said so there's nothing
[1:15:12] so now we realize that this lady she has
[1:15:15] decided there is no going back and the
[1:15:18] Bible told us she left talking
[1:15:20] Hallelujah
[1:15:22] and so when I read that and some of the
[1:15:25] other Summers I came up with the ways
[1:15:28] that Believers should make decisions
[1:15:31] amen
[1:15:32] so I found out that the first approach
[1:15:35] to decision making for believers is to
[1:15:37] put God first
[1:15:40] Hallelujah Whatever the song you are
[1:15:43] making whether it's physical whether
[1:15:44] it's spiritual whether it's for yourself
[1:15:46] or others make sure God is Central to
[1:15:49] that decision
[1:15:51] once you put God in that decision that
[1:15:54] means it becomes a program of God
[1:15:56] and then God doesn't fail
[1:15:59] amen
[1:16:00] so put God first
[1:16:04] there are accounts foreign
[1:16:08] the next thing to do in your decision
[1:16:10] making process is to ensure you do so on
[1:16:14] time
[1:16:16] Hallelujah don't just hang around and
[1:16:19] say well anytime I feel you can't you
[1:16:20] don't have all the time
[1:16:22] even though we are Eternal beings
[1:16:25] but the body we are operating with today
[1:16:28] is not etana
[1:16:30] ensure it's a wasting body
[1:16:33] and that's why God had other provisions
[1:16:36] because he has a glorified body for us
[1:16:38] this body cannot go in rapture
[1:16:41] Hallelujah
[1:16:43] and it's good to care for it but don't
[1:16:45] waste your time too much on that
[1:16:47] Hallelujah just keep it up so that I can
[1:16:50] serve you here because after here is of
[1:16:53] no use
[1:16:55] Hallelujah and that's why God said does
[1:16:58] that word to those thou return us that
[1:17:01] was talking about this body
[1:17:03] amen
[1:17:04] and so you don't have forever
[1:17:08] in making your decisions do so on time
[1:17:13] in the salmon time of decision paragraph
[1:17:15] 21 to 22 where I'm talking about the
[1:17:18] sister that she had um proposals from
[1:17:22] two good Brothers
[1:17:24] you know two of them were trying to get
[1:17:26] a hand in marriage but she couldn't make
[1:17:28] her mind up
[1:17:29] she didn't know whether to choose
[1:17:31] whether he or B and brother said because
[1:17:33] she wasted so much time she lost the two
[1:17:36] brothers
[1:17:40] so we need to make up our mind on time
[1:17:44] you can also check that in January
[1:17:46] Genesis 24 psalm 58.
[1:17:49] that's about sister Rebecca
[1:17:52] you know Hallelujah
[1:17:55] if you go through that one time Abraham
[1:17:59] he decided that Isaac should not marry
[1:18:02] from the daughters of the land you know
[1:18:04] that gospel has remained through from
[1:18:06] Genesis to Revelation Believers will
[1:18:08] marry believers
[1:18:10] saying you are going to go and look for
[1:18:12] a wife for my son among my Kindred so
[1:18:16] eliasa was taxed with that job
[1:18:19] and Eleazar haven't learned the ways of
[1:18:21] Abraham that Abraham put God first in
[1:18:24] everything he does when she go when he
[1:18:26] got there he prayed first
[1:18:29] and what was the prayer let it be that
[1:18:32] any daughter
[1:18:33] that I will ask for water and she will
[1:18:37] offer to give water to my Commerce and
[1:18:39] my men let that be the same one you have
[1:18:42] chosen for your son Isaac that was his
[1:18:44] prayer
[1:18:45] Hallelujah and we saw that Rebecca came
[1:18:48] up and then he approached and says look
[1:18:52] um I'm a I'm a traveler I need water to
[1:18:54] drink so oh no problem I have water
[1:18:57] first so let me rush and get your
[1:18:59] comments water
[1:19:01] and then he was surprised does that is
[1:19:04] that how God has prayers so quickly yes
[1:19:07] sometimes it does that
[1:19:09] but often time it doesn't come so
[1:19:11] quickly but ultimately he answers our
[1:19:14] prayers
[1:19:15] Hallelujah
[1:19:17] so Rebecca did that and then he asked
[1:19:20] whose daughters are you whose daughter
[1:19:22] are you I say I'm from Beethoven exactly
[1:19:25] where it was sent
[1:19:27] and then realized God has answered this
[1:19:29] prayer
[1:19:29] and he offered all the gifts and said
[1:19:31] take me to your home
[1:19:33] and when they go there they explain his
[1:19:37] mission and now God has answered this
[1:19:39] prayer and that's our brothers if we
[1:19:41] want to take on a wife you should be
[1:19:43] bold enough to go to their house
[1:19:46] you should be avoided enough to discuss
[1:19:48] with whoever needs to be discussed with
[1:19:50] there is nothing to hide about marriage
[1:19:53] relationship
[1:19:54] Hallelujah because it's Brahman said
[1:19:57] after the gift of after salvation the
[1:20:00] gift of your spouse is the next best
[1:20:01] thing
[1:20:03] and so it should be done with all the
[1:20:06] enthusiasm that we need and in line with
[1:20:09] the word
[1:20:10] amen so he got to the house and then
[1:20:13] they found out that well they said this
[1:20:14] is the move of God we have nothing
[1:20:16] against it but
[1:20:20] our sister is going to go with you can
[1:20:22] you let us stay with us for like 10 days
[1:20:24] you know so that we just look at her
[1:20:26] face and all that
[1:20:28] and then let us say please don't end up
[1:20:30] me saying that God has blessed me
[1:20:33] okay since they cannot agree they say
[1:20:36] let's ask sister Rebecca will you go
[1:20:38] with the man he said I will go
[1:20:41] today not tomorrow
[1:20:43] so decisions must be made on time
[1:20:47] Hallelujah
[1:20:49] another thing you need to do is that
[1:20:52] when you are making decision there it
[1:20:54] must be a clear-cut decision
[1:20:57] don't say I want black and white
[1:21:00] what do you want the black item or the
[1:21:03] white one you can't want the two
[1:21:06] so it must be clear cut I'm a Christian
[1:21:09] but
[1:21:10] um there's no but
[1:21:12] it must be a Christian and you must be
[1:21:15] ready to follow through in short you
[1:21:18] need to burn the bridges that leads you
[1:21:19] back
[1:21:21] that's what we call a clear-cut decision
[1:21:24] and that's what sister Ruth did he said
[1:21:27] there is nothing with me and more I
[1:21:29] begin
[1:21:30] so once I've married your son I have
[1:21:33] married Israel I am an Israelite
[1:21:36] your God are now my God
[1:21:38] anything about you is mine
[1:21:41] Hallelujah so believe us we need to make
[1:21:44] a clerical decision once there is so
[1:21:47] much ambiguity even the motivation to
[1:21:50] progress will be less
[1:21:52] so we have learned through things now
[1:21:54] your decision must have got a center
[1:21:57] theme of it then it must be made on time
[1:22:00] and then it must be clear-cut
[1:22:03] Hallelujah
[1:22:05] then another thing when you make a
[1:22:08] Clockwork decision
[1:22:09] decision requires service
[1:22:13] Hallelujah so everything whether you
[1:22:16] have decided to be a Christian there are
[1:22:19] Works to be done
[1:22:23] you are sleeping at home you have not
[1:22:26] made a decision
[1:22:28] amen even I want to be a mother oh I'm
[1:22:32] praying God give me fruit of the womb
[1:22:33] there is what's to be done
[1:22:35] amen because those children they require
[1:22:38] attention they cannot just say I'm a
[1:22:41] mother I don't have time for all these
[1:22:42] dirty things you are not ready
[1:22:44] there is work to be done and some of
[1:22:47] these works you cannot delegate them
[1:22:50] oh you shall get to Nani oh I will do
[1:22:52] this
[1:22:53] Hallelujah
[1:22:55] you are trying to dodge responsibilities
[1:22:58] in management you cannot delegate
[1:23:01] responsibility
[1:23:02] if I say oh help me sweep that floor
[1:23:05] but it's your job if the fly is not well
[1:23:08] swept you get the blame
[1:23:11] because you cannot delegate
[1:23:13] responsibility so children their
[1:23:15] responsibilities no matter you push each
[1:23:18] other and there is still your call
[1:23:20] amen
[1:23:22] so it doesn't matter where you are
[1:23:25] once you have them
[1:23:27] you have to give accounts
[1:23:29] and so when you remember that you know
[1:23:31] the work has to be done well
[1:23:34] and that goes for every other thing even
[1:23:37] children you are children at home
[1:23:40] does that when we are born in Christian
[1:23:43] home is God's heritage because some are
[1:23:46] born otherwise what do you want them to
[1:23:49] do
[1:23:50] but you are born in the light you know
[1:23:53] you're left from right you should
[1:23:54] appreciate God for that
[1:23:57] sometimes you look like oh they are
[1:23:59] buttoning us or they don't allow us to
[1:24:01] be free
[1:24:02] may the Lord help us
[1:24:05] that is the same they said they are
[1:24:07] trying to save a small chick from the
[1:24:10] oak
[1:24:11] but why do you think the chick is saying
[1:24:13] he said they don't allow me to have a
[1:24:15] good time
[1:24:16] yeah that's it and that's what our
[1:24:19] children think oftentimes good time is
[1:24:21] called to death
[1:24:24] and so those who know better than I said
[1:24:26] that ways there is no way there
[1:24:28] Insurance stay close but I say no I'm
[1:24:31] free I have your rights Brethren I will
[1:24:34] write this by the word
[1:24:36] Hallelujah that way we can enjoy the
[1:24:39] journey
[1:24:40] because all gods are for us Bible told
[1:24:43] us God's thought towards us is good
[1:24:46] to bring us to the expected end
[1:24:49] Hallelujah whether you are a child you
[1:24:51] are an adult all God's plan for you is
[1:24:55] for goodness
[1:24:57] sometimes they correct you but it's for
[1:24:59] your good
[1:25:01] once Believers understand this concept
[1:25:04] we go through our journey enjoy and
[1:25:07] peace
[1:25:08] amen so your decision will lead you to
[1:25:12] service
[1:25:14] oh I want to be I want to have my degree
[1:25:17] bachelor's associate whatever it is
[1:25:19] there is work to be done
[1:25:22] and you cannot pray with the service
[1:25:25] we go and fast for seven days so that I
[1:25:28] can pass exam without reading there is
[1:25:30] no word for it
[1:25:31] you will fail
[1:25:33] Hallelujah there is no shortcut to
[1:25:36] Victory
[1:25:38] Hallelujah
[1:25:39] someone should make decisions be ready
[1:25:42] to serve
[1:25:45] so in a quarter Cross Physical spiritual
[1:25:51] so there's no children also we are
[1:25:53] talking spiritual now let me just pray
[1:25:55] about it you pray about it you work
[1:25:57] about it
[1:25:58] Hallelujah
[1:26:00] then after that service
[1:26:04] God takes control
[1:26:07] you know your decision making now you
[1:26:09] have put God first in four items that I
[1:26:12] say work for God too and that's why I
[1:26:15] believe as the one of God acts 38 he
[1:26:18] said repent be baptized
[1:26:21] in the name of Jesus Christ then God
[1:26:24] will give you the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:26] that's God's work
[1:26:28] in decision making too there is a rest
[1:26:31] for you
[1:26:32] amen there is a rest promise whether
[1:26:36] it's Christianity whether in your
[1:26:38] physical and the others that will be a
[1:26:40] time that you climax
[1:26:43] and then you can go on autopilot people
[1:26:46] often today they see physically now they
[1:26:49] see all those guys who have made some
[1:26:51] achievements
[1:26:52] and then young boy want to be like that
[1:26:56] you know a teenager I was 21 year old
[1:26:57] wants to drive Rolls-Royce
[1:26:59] because I see some adults driving it he
[1:27:02] didn't know that there is a journey
[1:27:04] between the two
[1:27:07] you know because everything is just in
[1:27:08] our faces
[1:27:10] but it's not just like that
[1:27:12] there are some things to be put in
[1:27:15] and so we say that in the case of rules
[1:27:17] which is our main subject
[1:27:19] after they got to Bethlehem Judah
[1:27:23] she looked at the mother-in-law
[1:27:25] say you are old now but I'm still young
[1:27:28] and then we've got to eat
[1:27:31] and this goes straight to the brothers
[1:27:34] you have a responsibility to take care
[1:27:36] of your own
[1:27:37] Bible told us that those who don't take
[1:27:39] care of their own they are worse than an
[1:27:41] infidel
[1:27:42] oh I'm looking for a job to sit in the
[1:27:44] office God will grant it pending that
[1:27:46] time you've got to do something
[1:27:48] Hallelujah I don't say oh I'm praying
[1:27:52] about it pray and walk
[1:27:55] and so Ruth when they got to Bethlehem
[1:27:58] Judah he said I've got to find something
[1:28:00] to do because we got to eat
[1:28:03] and so she decided to claim Bible said
[1:28:06] they came into Bethlehem Judah at the
[1:28:09] time of Bali Harvest
[1:28:11] and so you know according to the law of
[1:28:13] God God told them that when you want to
[1:28:15] harvest your crops
[1:28:17] don't Advance everything
[1:28:20] you know live some because of the poor
[1:28:23] of the land
[1:28:24] so that's what gleaning about when the
[1:28:27] investors are working whatever is Left
[1:28:29] Behind the glimmastic
[1:28:32] and so Ruth decided that that's what I
[1:28:34] would do because I mean maybe I don't
[1:28:37] have a work permit yet I don't have all
[1:28:39] this so I've got to do something
[1:28:41] you know we like to give excuses
[1:28:43] oftentimes
[1:28:45] God don't take excuses
[1:28:47] amen
[1:28:49] and so rude did not give excuse
[1:28:52] she went about doing the work because
[1:28:54] the Mother-in-law must do what she must
[1:28:58] eat
[1:28:59] and so she did that she was taking
[1:29:01] notice of that's why they find that she
[1:29:03] was a more abilities Bible said
[1:29:06] it has been reported to me
[1:29:09] that you're a virtuous woman
[1:29:12] she did not follow the young man whether
[1:29:14] I reach or poor she was focused on why
[1:29:18] she was on that land
[1:29:20] and so if we go to chapter three there
[1:29:22] nominal look at everything and say my
[1:29:25] daughter
[1:29:26] shall I not find rest for you that's
[1:29:28] where we are rest
[1:29:30] and what was the rest he said you are
[1:29:33] going to do now the advance is over
[1:29:36] I don't know how long it was for
[1:29:37] there'll be a festival a kind of party
[1:29:40] in that party you are going to dress
[1:29:42] properly
[1:29:44] the owner of the farm which is Boaz
[1:29:49] in someone kinsman redeemer that's like
[1:29:53] Christ to us
[1:29:54] a king's man who came to redeem us
[1:29:58] Hallelujah
[1:30:00] so that boy said Mark where are we sleep
[1:30:04] when in the night you go there sleeping
[1:30:07] under his leg uncover the feet and stay
[1:30:10] there the man would know what to do
[1:30:12] because of course there is a tradition
[1:30:16] now brethren whether this behavior is
[1:30:19] contrary to roots
[1:30:22] procedure in their country is relevant
[1:30:25] she told the Mother-in-law all that you
[1:30:27] tell me I will do
[1:30:30] Hallelujah you know he said well I'm a
[1:30:33] message believer the message commands so
[1:30:36] you must believe it oh don't say I take
[1:30:38] exception then you are not ready to
[1:30:40] follow
[1:30:42] and so rude said all that you tell me I
[1:30:44] will do it and she did and when a boy
[1:30:48] has woke up
[1:30:49] he said what a lady here what's going on
[1:30:52] and she she told him you are the near
[1:30:55] Kingsman come by me
[1:30:58] that way both understand what she was
[1:31:00] talking about and said okay
[1:31:03] you take your rest I will do all that
[1:31:06] needs to be done and then the story told
[1:31:08] us that in the morning Boaz gave us some
[1:31:11] gift I said go to your mother-in-law the
[1:31:14] procedure required I will do them and
[1:31:16] when she got to the Mother-in-law when I
[1:31:18] said look you just go and rest
[1:31:21] Hallelujah
[1:31:22] dancing the procedure of God when the
[1:31:25] Holy Ghost is giving you don't toast to
[1:31:28] and fro
[1:31:29] all the issues around they don't move
[1:31:31] you anymore because you are grounded in
[1:31:33] the world
[1:31:34] things will happen
[1:31:36] but you place them in the world
[1:31:38] that's always the only ghost is say rest
[1:31:40] brother and the only ghost is not new
[1:31:44] heaven it's not New Jerusalem
[1:31:46] but it's like the promised land you know
[1:31:48] in the promised land when they left
[1:31:50] Egypt they got into Israel they see how
[1:31:53] it was
[1:31:54] you know they have battles to fight over
[1:31:57] there there is no more battle to fight
[1:32:00] it's Eternal rest so only ghost is that
[1:32:03] Promised Land
[1:32:04] and it's a promised land for all
[1:32:06] believers and you will have it too
[1:32:09] Hallelujah brother about the only ghost
[1:32:12] we often when I saw I'm trusting God for
[1:32:14] Holy Ghost and trusting God it is a
[1:32:16] promise of God for you it is something
[1:32:19] that you must have
[1:32:21] because without the only goals there is
[1:32:24] nothing because it cannot be like Christ
[1:32:26] except the Christ spirit is in you
[1:32:28] so only God is compulsory for all
[1:32:30] believers God understand that and you
[1:32:33] will have it
[1:32:34] amen he told us in the Book of Luke ask
[1:32:38] and you shall be giving knock and you
[1:32:41] shall find
[1:32:42] and he said how many of you fathers will
[1:32:46] your son or child ask for fish and you
[1:32:49] give him snake
[1:32:51] or ask for bread and you give Stone
[1:32:53] he concluded by saying if you who are
[1:32:56] wicked know how to give good gifts to
[1:32:59] your children how much more your
[1:33:01] heavenly Father in heaven we give holy
[1:33:04] ghosts for those who desire it
[1:33:07] so brother if he desire only goes
[1:33:09] tonight or today it is yours Hallelujah
[1:33:13] insurance is one of the primary things
[1:33:16] Christ went up for
[1:33:18] so be ready to receive it
[1:33:21] amen
[1:33:22] and so now we told rules rest
[1:33:27] that man that you saw
[1:33:29] he will not rest until he has finished
[1:33:32] the program
[1:33:34] so after you have make your decision
[1:33:37] putting God first
[1:33:40] doing it on time make the decision a
[1:33:43] clear quarter to one no ambiguity then
[1:33:45] you serve that will be a rest
[1:33:49] your neighbors in this world there is a
[1:33:52] rest will Crown it perhaps a God is not
[1:33:54] the answer of frustration
[1:33:57] it's not like that if things are
[1:33:59] promised in the Bible they are
[1:34:01] accomplished and they are achievable
[1:34:02] they are not myths or some stories
[1:34:05] God must be lifted up out of History if
[1:34:09] he did it yesterday brother I can do it
[1:34:10] today
[1:34:12] and they still do it tomorrow
[1:34:14] if those who have been attended to they
[1:34:17] come unto God upon some basis if you
[1:34:19] come on that basis too Brethren you will
[1:34:21] receive what you Pro what you desire
[1:34:23] it's not some rocket science
[1:34:26] you will have what you desire
[1:34:30] and so after that after service and rest
[1:34:34] then the rest is not the reward there
[1:34:38] are still a reward promise
[1:34:40] a man in the case of rules let me
[1:34:44] explain what the concept of reward
[1:34:46] reward is not salary
[1:34:48] are we together
[1:34:50] salary reasonably commensurate with the
[1:34:53] work you put in
[1:34:54] but reward is way above that
[1:34:58] Amen
[1:34:59] Let me give you like um people work in
[1:35:03] those multinationals they call something
[1:35:05] stock option
[1:35:07] you know for instance if you work with
[1:35:09] Apple
[1:35:10] Incorporated and then maybe
[1:35:14] um maybe a marketer or something and
[1:35:16] then they say okay with this job if you
[1:35:18] work with us for maybe five years or
[1:35:21] something you'll be entitled to
[1:35:24] maybe two thousand units of Apple stock
[1:35:27] you know
[1:35:29] now apple is a I think three trillion
[1:35:33] dollar country company now
[1:35:35] right and if you have 2 000 units of
[1:35:39] Apple shares maybe at the time they gave
[1:35:42] you it was what hundred dollars
[1:35:46] you know that's a hundred the last two
[1:35:48] hundred thousand dollars
[1:35:49] today maybe it's what 1000 something
[1:35:53] that's already having two million
[1:35:55] dollars to your name
[1:35:57] and it will keep growing that's the
[1:35:59] concept of reward
[1:36:00] far above salaries
[1:36:03] amen
[1:36:04] so that's what we are working for we are
[1:36:07] not working for salary there are
[1:36:09] handfuls of blessings that God will be
[1:36:11] dropping here and there but God promised
[1:36:13] us a reward
[1:36:14] amen and so for our rules you know what
[1:36:18] happened
[1:36:19] after she took the step follow now
[1:36:21] misinstruction she rested and then Boaz
[1:36:25] did what he has to do Bible says it once
[1:36:28] in those time he will call for Gathering
[1:36:31] he said there is also a nearer King's
[1:36:33] Man Batman said that person is a
[1:36:36] representative of Satan it's closer to
[1:36:39] us but he cannot redeem us it's just a
[1:36:42] Tormentor
[1:36:44] that's all he does it's not to help you
[1:36:46] it's not to so don't compromise with
[1:36:49] Satan when they make proposals so you
[1:36:51] check it by the word proposal Satan it
[1:36:54] might look good today but ultimately
[1:36:56] it's bad for you
[1:36:58] it's a bad business
[1:37:00] so this guy was calling to a meeting by
[1:37:03] Boaz
[1:37:04] um elimelech Ave land you know the story
[1:37:07] and then he needs to be redeemed and the
[1:37:09] guy said oh I can buy the land
[1:37:17] [Music]
[1:37:19] my inheritance
[1:37:21] so and then they have to pull off his
[1:37:23] shoe you know you can see that in case
[1:37:25] my redeemer
[1:37:26] and so Boaz became the rightful person
[1:37:29] to redeem Ruth
[1:37:31] and then she he did that by the land and
[1:37:35] made Rose his wife Allelujah
[1:37:38] whoever thinks that rules
[1:37:41] a window
[1:37:42] can become mother of children in such a
[1:37:46] short period that's what a God can do
[1:37:50] so don't lose hope whatever be your
[1:37:52] circumstance you might have looked left
[1:37:54] and right back and forth and you can't
[1:37:57] see a way Brethren where there is no way
[1:37:59] he promised us that he wouldn't become
[1:38:01] the way for us
[1:38:02] amen so believe us we don't lose hope we
[1:38:06] increase our faith in God
[1:38:08] amen
[1:38:10] so Ruth became the wife of Boaz
[1:38:14] and I said that is not enough but then
[1:38:17] look at this
[1:38:18] when Roots was in the plantation during
[1:38:22] the Harvest
[1:38:24] you know following the Reapers you know
[1:38:26] they say don't go there this is your
[1:38:29] area this is your area now that route
[1:38:31] now became the wife of the owner of the
[1:38:33] farm
[1:38:35] hallelujah what kind of reward do you
[1:38:38] think that is
[1:38:39] she has become a part owner of the same
[1:38:42] Farm
[1:38:43] all the superiors and supervisors and
[1:38:45] whatever they are now under her
[1:38:48] that's what God does all the time
[1:38:50] Brethren trust the Lord
[1:38:53] Hallelujah
[1:38:55] so as if that is not enough
[1:38:58] God gave by his son
[1:39:00] Bible they called the name Obed
[1:39:03] who became the father of Jesse and then
[1:39:06] the father of David and then up to Jesus
[1:39:08] Christ
[1:39:09] that's the reward so Brethren quickly
[1:39:13] take note that in decision making you've
[1:39:16] got to put God first
[1:39:18] you've got to decide first and on time
[1:39:21] your audition must be clear caught
[1:39:24] no ambiguity then you must be ready to
[1:39:28] serve under that history don't say oh I
[1:39:30] decide but you are not ready to know you
[1:39:32] have not decided
[1:39:34] Hallelujah then when you have done those
[1:39:37] four go with grander effort with a rest
[1:39:40] Believers don't are not toast to and fro
[1:39:43] oh the word is coming to and then one
[1:39:45] time in Nigeria they thought I've
[1:39:47] forgotten the year now
[1:39:49] they told us the one will come to end
[1:39:51] October 28th I don't know whether I got
[1:39:54] here everybody was running a tasketta
[1:39:56] buying food stuff buying this selling
[1:40:00] what they have Believers are hard money
[1:40:02] they are buying them because they know
[1:40:04] that the if the world is coming to and
[1:40:07] nobody should know the date
[1:40:09] Hallelujah and that's the way we are in
[1:40:12] this world when you see all these moves
[1:40:13] you see the moves of the Antichrist you
[1:40:16] know where they belong
[1:40:18] amen you know the devil always try to
[1:40:20] make the first move
[1:40:22] that's the way he does when he make that
[1:40:25] move cool down just stay on the wall
[1:40:28] don't be under pressure
[1:40:30] because God has his own program and
[1:40:33] God's program nothing can stop it
[1:40:36] and then after those rest there'll be a
[1:40:39] reward breeding there was a time
[1:40:42] the disciples a rich young ruler came to
[1:40:45] Christ
[1:40:46] you know and then he said Master good
[1:40:49] Master what can I do to inherit the
[1:40:51] Kingdom of Heaven
[1:40:52] and Christ look at it and say why do you
[1:40:54] even call me good
[1:40:56] okay go and keep the law
[1:40:59] and he said all the laws have I kept
[1:41:02] from my youth
[1:41:04] and Bible said Christ loved him
[1:41:07] and he looked at him it's the only one
[1:41:09] thing left just one thing
[1:41:12] sell all that you have give to the poor
[1:41:15] take up your cross and follow me
[1:41:18] that's all I'm Bible told us I demand
[1:41:21] went back home sorrowfully
[1:41:24] because he had great possessions
[1:41:27] that's that was his problem he couldn't
[1:41:29] leave those possessions for Christ
[1:41:32] but in the same vein if you read further
[1:41:34] down
[1:41:35] Peter now
[1:41:37] look at Christ
[1:41:39] say Christ what's going on
[1:41:42] this guy could not leave money but we we
[1:41:45] have left all
[1:41:46] and we have followed you once our game
[1:41:50] Hallelujah
[1:41:52] and many of us will say what does Peter
[1:41:55] have
[1:41:57] but Christ did not say Peter they didn't
[1:41:58] leave anything
[1:42:00] because Peter wasn't really poor
[1:42:03] Hallelujah
[1:42:05] Peter was online
[1:42:07] but it wasn't poor
[1:42:09] and that's why I could look at Christ in
[1:42:11] the fancy look where this man cannot
[1:42:13] leave money when we have left both money
[1:42:15] Family everything
[1:42:17] what is our gain
[1:42:19] amen hallelujah and Christ told him
[1:42:23] whoever left father mother whatever in
[1:42:27] this world he said in this same world I
[1:42:30] will reward the person a hundred fold
[1:42:33] Hallelujah so Christianity has reward
[1:42:37] amen and then they want to come eternal
[1:42:41] life
[1:42:42] amen
[1:42:43] you know some people do the research I
[1:42:45] think you see our UK they were trying to
[1:42:48] find the benefit of Christianity
[1:42:51] they are not Christians they just
[1:42:52] decided to commission the research and
[1:42:55] then so their findings they said um they
[1:42:59] cannot see whether the Miracles are
[1:43:01] happening or anything
[1:43:02] but one thing they found out
[1:43:05] that all the people call themselves
[1:43:08] Christian that because of the the the
[1:43:11] communal interaction that there seems to
[1:43:15] be better than the rest I said that's
[1:43:17] even enough for us hallelujah
[1:43:21] amen that's the worldly people amen so
[1:43:24] in being a Christian that's reward in
[1:43:27] following the law of God there is great
[1:43:28] reward amen God is conscious of your
[1:43:32] efforts amen that's why he came you know
[1:43:36] he took the form of his servants so that
[1:43:39] I can be tempted as you and me
[1:43:42] and then he became the high priest of
[1:43:44] our confession
[1:43:45] the Bible told us that sometimes you
[1:43:47] don't even know what to pray for but the
[1:43:50] spirit interceded for us hallelujah
[1:43:53] because we are God's children and the
[1:43:56] devil cannot have upper hand in our
[1:43:57] lives I'm so certain of that
[1:44:00] a child of God can never be lost
[1:44:03] because we have the same material with
[1:44:06] Christ
[1:44:07] Hallelujah whether you realize it or not
[1:44:10] that's just the truth
[1:44:12] amen
[1:44:13] and somewhere I see quickly looking at
[1:44:15] something you know I told you earlier
[1:44:19] that the prophet preached three sermons
[1:44:22] relating to decisions he preached a
[1:44:25] power of decision I encourage you to go
[1:44:27] and read it I want them to give me
[1:44:29] numbers 14 30.
[1:44:32] the power what does decision what is the
[1:44:35] power and decision making don't let us
[1:44:37] be wishing washing you want to do
[1:44:38] anything make a clear-cut decision
[1:44:41] because he has power Numbers Chapter 14
[1:44:45] verse 13. I want to just so just to
[1:44:49] illustrate the power of decision
[1:44:56] okay
[1:44:58] I'm Moses said unto the Lord is that 14
[1:45:02] no 30 30.
[1:45:06] not 13.
[1:45:10] now he said that less
[1:45:14] you shall not come into the land
[1:45:16] concerning which I swear to make you do
[1:45:19] a grn safe Caleb the son of jeffony and
[1:45:23] Joshua the son of noon the background to
[1:45:27] this is that trespasses were sent to
[1:45:30] inspire the land
[1:45:31] you know God said John sent To Us by his
[1:45:33] Elders let them go into the land to see
[1:45:36] whether it is actually flowing with milk
[1:45:38] and honey
[1:45:39] that's their job and then they went and
[1:45:42] 10 others came back and said no
[1:45:44] the land is truly flowing with milk and
[1:45:47] honey as shown by the fruit you know
[1:45:49] carried between two men
[1:45:51] but
[1:45:53] God did not send the message of birth
[1:45:56] but they added that to them
[1:46:01] there are giants in the land and so
[1:46:03] forth and we cannot go but this Joshua
[1:46:06] and Caleb they decided that no
[1:46:10] we can go
[1:46:12] and sure let's go up at once and take
[1:46:15] over
[1:46:16] Allelujah power up decision and God came
[1:46:20] down because people decided to Stone
[1:46:22] them because when 10 people are saying
[1:46:24] something only two are saying otherwise
[1:46:26] you know majority minority may have
[1:46:29] their say but majority will always have
[1:46:31] their way but that's not the way God
[1:46:33] works
[1:46:34] Hallelujah any minority that stay with
[1:46:37] you well God stays with them
[1:46:43] it is father's good pleasure to give you
[1:46:45] the Kingdom of Heaven oh someone said
[1:46:47] your stretch is too small God is not
[1:46:49] there God is there as long as the world
[1:46:51] is there
[1:46:52] the number is irrelevant
[1:46:55] amen and so God came down and said what
[1:47:00] and those standard as they died right
[1:47:02] there
[1:47:03] and God further establish Joshua and
[1:47:06] kill him I told them because you people
[1:47:08] another spirit is in you you have
[1:47:10] decided for me only two of you will get
[1:47:13] into the Promised Land
[1:47:15] power off decision
[1:47:17] he said all those other people
[1:47:19] from age 20 upward none of them would
[1:47:23] get into the Canaan land except these
[1:47:26] two people that's power decision you
[1:47:29] make today
[1:47:30] can you see look at this church it's a
[1:47:33] decision of some people
[1:47:35] Hallelujah even you you are living in
[1:47:38] somebody's decision
[1:47:40] amen all those things we see around us
[1:47:43] they are just a little trace of God's
[1:47:46] infinite abilities
[1:47:48] somebody can look the prophet told us we
[1:47:50] are creators
[1:47:52] from your mind you have a vision and
[1:47:55] then you can bring you to reality those
[1:47:57] are powers of decisions
[1:47:59] so don't let's be afraid to make
[1:48:01] decisions especially decision for God
[1:48:04] then a preachers to another one the
[1:48:06] results or reward of decision that you
[1:48:09] can see in the Book of Joshua chapter 1
[1:48:13] India God
[1:48:15] after the death of Moses God called unto
[1:48:18] Joshua he said now my sister Moses my
[1:48:21] servant is dead you are to lead the
[1:48:23] people
[1:48:25] the result of decision Joshua became a
[1:48:28] leader
[1:48:29] after Moses because of that decision it
[1:48:32] took being a spy he decided to be
[1:48:36] against the time even though the 10 they
[1:48:38] are more in numbers and no the word of
[1:48:40] God say this and stand by this and I'm
[1:48:42] ready to die by it but we said I did not
[1:48:45] die he became a leader in Hallelujah
[1:48:49] also um kill him
[1:48:52] at the time he went to spy Bible told us
[1:48:55] Caleb was 40 years old
[1:48:57] at this time he went to Joshua I said
[1:49:00] Joshua I think that is um
[1:49:03] chapter Joshua chapter 14 just for your
[1:49:07] reference and that time he went back to
[1:49:09] Joshua I said Joshua you remember when
[1:49:12] me and you and the rest of the elders we
[1:49:15] went to go and spy the land and you know
[1:49:17] what happened that
[1:49:19] Moses promised me
[1:49:22] that it will give me a land the land
[1:49:26] that my leg has touched
[1:49:28] so it reminded you shall look
[1:49:30] my strength I am now 85 years old
[1:49:34] you know 40 45 years have passed
[1:49:38] since that decision was made
[1:49:40] he said as I was then so my strength now
[1:49:44] halleluia the decision stop Aging in his
[1:49:48] life
[1:49:50] are we together
[1:49:52] he testified himself that I can still go
[1:49:55] to war the way I was then so I am give
[1:49:59] me the land so that I will go and
[1:50:01] possess it reward of decision
[1:50:05] and we saw that Joshua the Bible said
[1:50:07] Joshua gave him the land of Abram
[1:50:10] so Abram belonged to Joshua and his
[1:50:12] children up to today
[1:50:14] Hallelujah reward of decision then I
[1:50:17] have explained to you time of decision
[1:50:19] earlier that's concerning Rebecca when
[1:50:22] even though she was to go and meet a man
[1:50:24] she didn't even know
[1:50:26] you know she didn't know Isaac she
[1:50:28] didn't know but according to she saw
[1:50:31] that this is God's promise
[1:50:33] this is a prayer answered you know and
[1:50:36] that's my brethren when we see God
[1:50:37] manifesting it will be wrong for us to
[1:50:40] turn our back to it what do we want to
[1:50:42] say again
[1:50:44] this message you want to say God is Not
[1:50:46] There
[1:50:47] is there if he's there what are we
[1:50:50] waiting for why are we not committed
[1:50:53] may the Lord help us let's make our
[1:50:56] decision and God will back us up
[1:50:59] Hallelujah
[1:51:00] oh praise the Lord
[1:51:02] and you can also find that for time of
[1:51:05] decision also numbers 13 30. at that
[1:51:08] time Caleb said instead of wasting our
[1:51:11] time here let's go apart once you know
[1:51:15] why do others are making excuses the
[1:51:17] land of giant this and that say Brethren
[1:51:20] let's leave that let's do so now brother
[1:51:22] listen to Joshua and Caleb they won't be
[1:51:25] where they were
[1:51:27] but they were dragging feet so Brethren
[1:51:30] let's make decision
[1:51:32] Hallelujah we are still continuing now I
[1:51:36] want to read something if you can give
[1:51:37] me choosing of a bride
[1:51:40] is only one choosing of a bride

[1:52:32] there we look at the prophet decision
[1:52:34] then what do you do yourself
[1:52:37] and let me continue to say in many
[1:52:39] things of life we are given a choice the
[1:52:43] way of life itself is a choice
[1:52:45] we have a right to make our own way is
[1:52:48] your right
[1:52:49] choose our own way that we want to live
[1:52:52] education is a choice
[1:52:54] we can choose whether we are going to be
[1:52:56] educated or whether we are not going to
[1:52:58] be educated that's the choice that we
[1:53:01] have
[1:53:02] right and wrong is a choice
[1:53:05] every man every woman boy and girl has
[1:53:09] to choose whether they are going to try
[1:53:11] to live right or not live right it's a
[1:53:15] choice choice is a great thing your
[1:53:19] Eternal destination is a choice
[1:53:21] and maybe today some of you will make
[1:53:24] that choice
[1:53:26] of where you will spend
[1:53:28] eternity okay there before this service
[1:53:31] ends tonight or today there will be one
[1:53:35] time that if you turn God down many
[1:53:38] times
[1:53:40] there will be one time you will turn him
[1:53:42] down the last time
[1:53:45] there's a line between mercy and
[1:53:47] judgment
[1:53:48] it's a dangerous thing for a man or a
[1:53:52] woman boy or girl to step across that
[1:53:55] line
[1:53:56] for there is no return when you step
[1:53:58] across that deadline
[1:54:00] so today
[1:54:02] it might be the time that many will make
[1:54:05] their decision
[1:54:07] where they will spend the endless
[1:54:10] eternity
[1:54:12] there is another choice that we have in
[1:54:15] life
[1:54:16] a life's companion a young man or young
[1:54:19] woman stepping out on life has been
[1:54:23] given a right to make a choice
[1:54:26] the young man chooses the young woman
[1:54:28] has a right to accept or Rejoice but it
[1:54:32] is still a choice on both sides both man
[1:54:36] and woman they have a right to choice
[1:54:40] also you have a choice as a Christian
[1:54:44] you have a choice of the church here in
[1:54:47] America so far that you can go to that's
[1:54:51] your own American privilege
[1:54:54] to choose any church that you want to
[1:54:56] belong to that's a choice you don't have
[1:54:59] to go to any of them if you don't want
[1:55:01] to but if you want to change from the
[1:55:05] messages to the Baptist or Catholics or
[1:55:08] precipit Protestants or so forth and
[1:55:11] there's nobody that can tell you or make
[1:55:12] you to come to any certain church that's
[1:55:15] our freedom that's what our democracy is
[1:55:18] every man can choose for himself freedom
[1:55:22] of religion that's a blessing God help
[1:55:25] us to keep it as long as you can
[1:55:28] you have also a choice when you choose
[1:55:32] this church you can choose whether in
[1:55:35] this church whether you will choose a
[1:55:37] church that will guide you to your
[1:55:40] Eternal destination
[1:55:42] you can choose a church that has a
[1:55:44] certain Creed that you might think that
[1:55:47] Creed is just what you want or the other
[1:55:49] church that has their Creed and then
[1:55:53] there is the word of God
[1:55:55] you have a choice of you have to make
[1:55:58] that choice that's an unwritten law
[1:56:01] Among Us of choosing you know the word
[1:56:04] of God if you have chosen to stick by
[1:56:08] the word of God you must make it all the
[1:56:10] way
[1:56:11] I mean that's why we have denomination
[1:56:13] they refuse to go all the way
[1:56:16] but once you have chosen that Lord I
[1:56:19] stand by your work because heaven and
[1:56:21] earth will pass away but everyone little
[1:56:23] duty of this one will not go without
[1:56:24] doing that with you to a sense then I
[1:56:27] will stand by it Hallelujah nothing want
[1:56:30] to look let's grab them also make a
[1:56:32] choice you know he had all the options
[1:56:34] he can join the denominations he has the
[1:56:37] gift and but he made a choice which made
[1:56:40] him unpopular
[1:56:41] let's look at standing in the Gap then I
[1:56:44] will not get to our own choice then we
[1:56:45] close
[1:56:48] standing in the Gap if you can get it
[1:56:52] 630623
[1:57:08] okay I'll continue reading here to save
[1:57:10] our time
[1:57:11] so I read them in paragraph 131.
[1:57:14] sobraham also made a choice let's see
[1:57:17] God also commented about his choice or
[1:57:20] his decision
[1:57:22] so that this will help you to make your
[1:57:24] own decision and choice too
[1:57:26] paragraph one three one
[1:57:34] so I was preaching in Los Angeles
[1:57:37] at the businessman's breakfast I need to
[1:57:40] read this background so that you
[1:57:41] understand what it is and something that
[1:57:44] I just learning on those organizations
[1:57:46] and they are said
[1:57:47] the admin of the assemblies and many of
[1:57:50] the Great dignitaries had gathered in
[1:57:52] there and when I got through speaking I
[1:57:54] started to leave the platform getting
[1:57:56] ready because the message was being sent
[1:57:58] out Across the Nation on radio and had
[1:58:00] to change back during this change when
[1:58:03] they cut up the radio then to send that
[1:58:05] message
[1:58:06] out and come back and announce the
[1:58:09] station I was in Clifton's
[1:58:11] where we had the breakfast
[1:58:14] and as I was walking from the upper
[1:58:17] platform to the lower
[1:58:19] a fine handsome looking young fellow of
[1:58:22] about 30 years old to run forth and
[1:58:24] threw his arm around me he said I'm
[1:58:27] Danny Henry
[1:58:28] and not knowing that it was a brother it
[1:58:32] was his brother doing the televising it
[1:58:35] televises there for the Christian
[1:58:37] businessmen and it's Jane Russell that
[1:58:40] movie star a cousin he was talking of
[1:58:42] Mario and Morrow our mother is a
[1:58:45] Pentecostal preacher and then when it
[1:58:47] started running to me he threw his arm
[1:58:50] around me and said God bless you with
[1:58:52] Abraham he said I hope
[1:58:56] excuse me I hope this doesn't sound
[1:58:58] sacrilegious but to my way of seeing it
[1:59:01] that message could be the 23rd chapter
[1:59:04] of Revelation you know it was saying
[1:59:07] that why the prophet preached about was
[1:59:09] not in the Bible
[1:59:10] is not Revelation ended 22nd so he said
[1:59:14] Ram has added to the Bible that's his
[1:59:16] own View so and when he said that he
[1:59:21] started speaking in tongues
[1:59:23] a boy who had never even heard of such a
[1:59:27] thing a Baptist by denomination
[1:59:30] as soon as they finish it turned white
[1:59:33] and he looked at me he didn't know what
[1:59:35] to do
[1:59:36] there is man standing here there where
[1:59:40] they are afraid how many were there at
[1:59:42] that time you know trying to confirm
[1:59:44] and there was a great big French woman
[1:59:48] sitting down there she raised up and
[1:59:50] said why that don't need any
[1:59:52] interpretation thank you it's up there
[1:59:55] that was purely French
[1:59:57] and the boy said I don't know one word
[2:00:00] of French
[2:00:01] and she had written down what he said
[2:00:04] and then there was a man setting on the
[2:00:07] corner I said that's correct I've got
[2:00:10] wrote I've got to wrote down what he
[2:00:12] said is French way back in the back
[2:00:15] a blonde headed handsome looking fellow
[2:00:18] standing up against the wall came
[2:00:20] forward and compared notes it was
[2:00:22] interpreter for the United Nation for
[2:00:24] French and this man over here was Victor
[2:00:28] Lido of the anvik church
[2:00:31] out there and he wrote it down and I've
[2:00:34] got the interpretation to it so the
[2:00:36] background was that Abraham was he
[2:00:38] preached a sermon he said it was you
[2:00:40] know collecting those denominations and
[2:00:42] so forth and this boy Baptist came
[2:00:44] around and said oh Brenda bam what I've
[2:00:47] just preached can be termed as 23rd
[2:00:50] chapter of Revelation
[2:00:52] and then when you touch the prophet you
[2:00:54] know he started speaking in tongues so
[2:00:56] we want to see what did he say so I'm
[2:00:58] going to just jump so to paragraph one
[2:01:01] 360. he said now yes what it said
[2:01:06] listen
[2:01:08] because thou has chosen the narrow past
[2:01:11] the other way
[2:01:13] down as a world in your own children
[2:01:17] are we together
[2:01:19] so this choice is yours
[2:01:21] you must own it
[2:01:23] amen
[2:01:26] and now I can see that Moses had to make
[2:01:30] his choice too
[2:01:31] see thou has picked the precise and
[2:01:36] correct way
[2:01:38] correct decision
[2:01:40] and it is my way
[2:01:42] amen underline my way the Holy Spirit
[2:01:47] speaking back
[2:01:48] because of this momentous decision
[2:01:52] a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee
[2:01:56] what a glorious decision
[2:01:58] now listen close what a glorious
[2:02:01] decision thou has made this in itself
[2:02:06] is that which you make and come to pass
[2:02:08] the tremendous victory in love divine
[2:02:12] Hallelujah its own decision
[2:02:16] that's that's my and then even though it
[2:02:19] was making his own decision God told him
[2:02:21] it is his own decision
[2:02:24] Hallelujah so how can you put God in
[2:02:26] your decision and that's how we say You
[2:02:29] must put God first
[2:02:31] God must be the central thing or for
[2:02:34] your decision whether it's personal
[2:02:36] whether it's official whether it's
[2:02:38] richer make sure you can put God in it
[2:02:41] you know Reverend said oh I think went
[2:02:44] to somewhere and I said don't talk about
[2:02:46] God yeah I said why they can't talk
[2:02:48] about God I can't be there myself
[2:02:50] Hallelujah so if any decision you are
[2:02:53] trying to make make sure you you wrap it
[2:02:55] back to God
[2:02:56] amen because that way God can hone you
[2:03:00] and once god holds you will not leave
[2:03:02] you Hallelujah we cannot hold God
[2:03:06] because our hand can get tired but when
[2:03:09] that unfailing hands is around you
[2:03:11] Hallelujah you can never fail
[2:03:14] amen
[2:03:17] and so let's talk to ourselves now I
[2:03:20] mean it will not be me talking let's
[2:03:22] read the time of decision paragraph
[2:03:25] 31-34
[2:03:27] time of decision that's your own
[2:03:29] decision how do you make your decision
[2:03:31] let's talk to ourselves we have seen
[2:03:33] examples from the Bible from the message
[2:03:35] then what about ourselves so 590611
[2:03:51] 590611
[2:03:52] 31 paragraph 31.
[2:03:57] this one is speaking directly to us
[2:04:00] about our decision making
[2:04:05] he said I read he said and then there
[2:04:08] was another great decision had to be
[2:04:10] made
[2:04:11] then after she was giving she's talking
[2:04:13] about Rebecca then the prince said well
[2:04:16] just let us stay around about 10 days
[2:04:19] let her hang around the Revival to
[2:04:21] really feel whether she has decided to
[2:04:24] do it or not I haven't got much
[2:04:27] confidence
[2:04:28] in a person make a decision to wait even
[2:04:32] until tomorrow
[2:04:34] are we together
[2:04:36] make it now
[2:04:38] but the message that still had Rebecca
[2:04:40] she was satisfying the message was from
[2:04:43] God
[2:04:45] so the parents said oh let us stick
[2:04:47] around the world she'll get over it
[2:04:49] maybe it's some infatuation and it's
[2:04:52] just a little excitement and she was
[2:04:55] over to that Revival you know but oh
[2:04:58] the truth servant said don't worry us
[2:05:02] don't hinder me a lot of the servant of
[2:05:05] God has been hindered by put up
[2:05:08] decisions don't hinder me seeing the
[2:05:11] Lord has sent me saying that he has been
[2:05:13] good to me don't hinder me then they say
[2:05:16] let her make her own decision
[2:05:20] that's where you stand tonight or today
[2:05:23] make your own decision
[2:05:25] then they call Rebecca and said will you
[2:05:29] go with this man or do you want to stay
[2:05:31] around a little while to see whether you
[2:05:33] really want to do it she said I will go
[2:05:36] what do you say today
[2:05:38] she was ready
[2:05:40] our decision was quickly made
[2:05:43] she knew there have been something been
[2:05:46] leading her she knew something had
[2:05:48] happened to her and she knew that it was
[2:05:51] God and she was satisfied she wanted to
[2:05:55] go quickly
[2:05:56] what are you waiting for once you are
[2:05:59] sure it was God may the Lord help us
[2:06:02] she put on a garment and she got all the
[2:06:05] gifts that was sent to her by the father
[2:06:07] to Medicine oh God if the church could
[2:06:11] only make that decision right quick
[2:06:14] put on all our gifts she climbed up on
[2:06:17] the camel and took out and it was in the
[2:06:21] evening time when Isaac had wandered
[2:06:23] from the tent out into the feet to
[2:06:25] meditate and when he seen the coming
[2:06:27] coming Rebecca looked at him and then it
[2:06:30] was loved at first sight
[2:06:33] a man because God wasn't it she had to
[2:06:37] believe it before she went
[2:06:39] oftentimes you want to see God moves
[2:06:41] first and God said move
[2:06:44] Hallelujah believe and you will see the
[2:06:47] glory of God I say sin is believing
[2:06:51] when you say why do you need to believe
[2:06:53] again
[2:06:54] aha you have seen it so what is the
[2:06:56] point of believing You Must Believe to
[2:06:58] see the glory of God amen Faith coming
[2:07:02] by hearing she didn't know what the man
[2:07:04] looked like and he didn't make no
[2:07:06] difference it was God making the
[2:07:09] decisions amen I don't care whether it's
[2:07:12] big or little what color is that makes
[2:07:15] me no difference he is my Lord I will
[2:07:18] love him when I see him because he is
[2:07:22] God's gift to me and to you
[2:07:24] she lighted up the camera and she had
[2:07:27] the brain from her face and I saw
[2:07:29] normally I spot the eyes of Isaac into
[2:07:32] our arms into hams he went and took her
[2:07:36] to the mother's place or the finest
[2:07:38] place and married her brother or sister
[2:07:40] listen
[2:07:42] there is no time to linger
[2:07:45] it is time to make the decision
[2:07:49] what kind of an effect as a message made
[2:07:52] on you
[2:07:53] are you ready to say I will go
[2:07:56] I will arise and go to Jesus it will
[2:08:00] embrace me in his arms
[2:08:02] in the arms of my dear savior oh there
[2:08:06] are 10 000 charms said the poet now

[2:08:45] you and me because you might take on
[2:08:48] something that you could never shake off

[2:08:54] you can be warned then if you step
[2:08:56] across the line of warning then you are
[2:08:59] already marked on the other side branded
[2:09:02] remember when the Jubilee year come
[2:09:06] and the priest rode with the trumpet
[2:09:08] sounding that every slave should could
[2:09:11] go straight
[2:09:12] but if they refuse to accept their
[2:09:15] freedom then he had to be taken to the
[2:09:18] temple
[2:09:19] to a post and an all born through him
[2:09:23] through the air
[2:09:25] and then inside this master always
[2:09:28] if you remember the Year of Jubilee
[2:09:30] somebody said oh I'm enjoying my master
[2:09:32] I don't want to be free but I'm saying
[2:09:35] no matter how much Jubilee sound here
[2:09:38] after that it will not make any
[2:09:40] difference
[2:09:41] are we together
[2:09:43] one that time comes for you to be free
[2:09:47] and say no no no no like wait I'm
[2:09:49] enjoying the wages of iniquity that
[2:09:52] person can no longer hear it even though
[2:09:54] if he's standing you say I can't respond
[2:09:56] again because it's too late May that
[2:09:58] never be our portion in the name of
[2:10:00] Jesus Christ
[2:10:02] he said but if they refuse to accept
[2:10:05] their freedom then he had to be taken to
[2:10:08] the Temple to report and then all
[2:10:10] brought him through the hair and then he
[2:10:13] served this master always
[2:10:15] it was put on his ear as a type of he
[2:10:18] had a faith coming by hearing he had
[2:10:21] that trumpets but he didn't want to
[2:10:23] listen to it
[2:10:25] amen look at this final paragraph I'm
[2:10:27] reading and many times
[2:10:30] men and women hear God's truth
[2:10:34] and Seed Vindicated and proven
[2:10:37] are we together
[2:10:39] truth but yet they don't want to hear it
[2:10:44] why he said there are some other reason
[2:10:48] Hallelujah oftentimes you see brothers
[2:10:51] or why have you not done this say I'm
[2:10:53] praying

[2:10:57] other reasons

[2:11:01] silence the question now because I say
[2:11:03] once you tell a believer I'm praying you
[2:11:05] okay okay but look at he said there is
[2:11:09] some other reason
[2:11:11] there is some other choosing that they
[2:11:13] have
[2:11:14] are we together
[2:11:16] when they can't make that decision they
[2:11:19] have some other choosing they are not
[2:11:21] proud to say it out so they will say I'm
[2:11:24] praying
[2:11:25] and say
[2:11:26] they done to face up to the truth and
[2:11:30] facts therefore their ears can be close
[2:11:34] to the gospel
[2:11:35] May that never be our portion

[2:16:23] why the music play Softly
[2:16:26] we just want to bring ourselves to a
[2:16:28] place of
[2:16:29] Consciousness with the word that being
[2:16:32] preached to us this morning
[2:16:35] like our brother says consciously
[2:16:38] and unconsciously we made decisions
[2:16:42] we react to things
[2:16:44] [Music]
[2:16:46] we make choices
[2:16:48] [Music]
[2:16:56] and that that the Holy Spirit was choose
[2:16:59] to speak to us this morning
[2:17:05] says alive
[2:17:07] full of excuses is now wanted of the
[2:17:10] Gospel
[2:17:12] and sometimes and many times we will
[2:17:15] make excuses is because of uncertainty
[2:17:19] and sometimes it's because of fear
[2:17:25] but you see he didn't give a spirit of
[2:17:27] fear
[2:17:29] he gave us his word
[2:17:34] and if we come to the place to realize
[2:17:36] that he's the one that keep us
[2:17:39] he's our keeper
[2:17:41] if the Lord do not keep us
[2:17:44] there's no way we can keep ourself
[2:17:49] [Music]
[2:17:59] this afternoon
[2:18:02] reflecting on the word
[2:18:04] I don't know how the Lord have spoke to
[2:18:07] you and there with your heart this
[2:18:09] morning
[2:18:10] I don't know what you're dealing with in
[2:18:12] your life I don't know where choices is
[2:18:14] before you
[2:18:17] but you see yeah
[2:18:21] just like our brother said your
[2:18:25] [Music]
[2:18:27] we have to realize and brother Branham
[2:18:30] share this also
[2:18:31] [Music]
[2:18:32] that for us to be here this morning
[2:18:35] for us each and every one of us that is
[2:18:38] in the building all that is under the
[2:18:40] sound of the message preached this
[2:18:42] morning
[2:18:43] for us to be here where we are
[2:18:46] it was God's choice for us
[2:18:48] [Music]
[2:18:51] he choose us
[2:18:54] Prophet was said in the message shall
[2:18:56] One in a Million
[2:18:58] when it comes to
[2:19:00] what if we would be a male or female it
[2:19:03] was his choice
[2:19:05] yes there were thousands and millions of
[2:19:07] cells
[2:19:09] that was in a race but it was God that
[2:19:12] choose this the egg cells and the blood
[2:19:14] cells for us to be here
[2:19:17] now you see if God
[2:19:20] if God will make you his first choice
[2:19:25] if he will make you his first choice
[2:19:31] what what are we choosing
[2:19:34] that we cannot make him our first choice
[2:19:40] you see God don't want to be
[2:19:43] the first among many
[2:19:45] he want to be the first and the only
[2:19:49] not the first among many choices
[2:19:54] that's the reason why we have to bring
[2:19:56] him into our choice that's the first
[2:19:59] thing we have to think about is this
[2:20:01] thing pleasing to the Lord
[2:20:03] what I have just said what the words
[2:20:06] that have just come out of my mouth
[2:20:08] is it pleasing
[2:20:11] to God
[2:20:12] [Music]
[2:20:15] please him
[2:20:17] this thing I want to do
[2:20:19] is the Lord please about it
[2:20:28] before the foundation of the word
[2:20:31] before God would create anything
[2:20:35] Paul let us know he choose us in him
[2:20:38] amen
[2:20:41] he make you his first choice
[2:20:45] because he know that that will influence
[2:20:48] your life
[2:20:50] to make him your first choice
[2:20:52] [Music]
[2:20:55] and that's why the mystery of God is
[2:20:57] revealed that's why God brought all of
[2:21:00] these things under the Seven Seals to
[2:21:02] let us know that we were choosing and
[2:21:05] predestinated from the foundation of the
[2:21:07] word he brought all of these things onto
[2:21:10] US
[2:21:10] to bring us to the place because his his
[2:21:13] purpose was to have the preeminence and
[2:21:17] God cannot have a preeminence in the
[2:21:19] midst of a people that that have their
[2:21:22] choices all scattered
[2:21:24] and
[2:21:25] the Lord is the last thing to think
[2:21:28] about it his word is the last thing that
[2:21:30] we consult and and and uh uh their
[2:21:33] personal objective Immortals is
[2:21:35] dominating your mind more than the
[2:21:38] promises of God
[2:21:42] can only have a preeminence in the midst
[2:21:46] of a people that make him their primary
[2:21:49] Choice their first choice brother banham
[2:21:51] says show me the man or the woman that
[2:21:54] put God first I will show you the one
[2:21:56] that we prosper in everything that we do
[2:22:01] is

[2:36:41] Father God Elijah's brother in the word
[2:36:44] and yet father Lord God may you bless us
[2:36:47] Lord father
[2:36:48] May the Holy Ghost bring these things
[2:36:50] back to our remembrance Lord amen
[2:36:53] May the Holy Ghost just find them Lord
[2:36:55] may he use the word that was preached to
[2:36:58] address things in our lives
[2:37:01] father we love you
[2:37:03] we thank you
[2:37:05] and we appreciate you Lord
[2:37:09] in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray
[2:37:13] amen amen
[2:37:21] preach the message what is the
[2:37:24] attraction
[2:37:28] now he uses a
[2:37:31] user
[2:37:33] blessing the word where he was able to
[2:37:37] uh
[2:37:40] draw the context of his text from that
[2:37:43] scripture what is the attraction on the
[2:37:45] mountain
[2:37:46] and Jesus coming in Jerusalem but then
[2:37:49] he talks about the different different
[2:37:51] biblical Mountain what is the attraction
[2:37:54] what was the attraction of Mount Sana he
[2:37:57] brought it to our day what is the
[2:37:59] attraction but if if you if you look
[2:38:03] into their subject you will realize that
[2:38:09] the major thought there is there Christ
[2:38:12] is our attraction amen
[2:38:15] amen amen
[2:38:17] amen Christ is our attraction
[2:38:20] and and and everything taking us from
[2:38:24] Christ is a destruction
[2:38:30] as a Son of God as a daughter of God
[2:38:34] as an as as an elect of God they have
[2:38:38] recognized what God is doing in this age
[2:38:42] Christ is our attraction the word is our
[2:38:46] attraction
[2:38:50] pool of the Holy Ghost is to attract us
[2:38:52] to the word because that is your defense
[2:38:55] that's your protection that's your
[2:38:59] strength that's your inspiration
[2:39:03] you might read other things
[2:39:05] look into
[2:39:07] Ado that are all part of our our daily
[2:39:11] activities
[2:39:13] but we have to bring our attraction into
[2:39:16] those things because you will not enjoy
[2:39:18] your job if God is not in it
[2:39:24] even I enjoy it it would just become
[2:39:26] going to work eight hours you come home
[2:39:28] you go back again and then you tired if
[2:39:31] you cannot find your attraction
[2:39:35] that's the reason why even take for the
[2:39:37] sense of marriage you're looking for the
[2:39:39] young man and you're looking for the
[2:39:40] young woman to marry if you just look at
[2:39:42] the beauty and that becomes your
[2:39:44] attraction that they're the the movement
[2:39:47] the word shows up
[2:39:51] you will start having problems with that
[2:39:52] person
[2:39:57] that is the major theme of that subject
[2:40:00] that's the reason why brother Branham
