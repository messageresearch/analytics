on the brain um but they're they're usually benign they are and so that started the process of going through all these different tests and they did a MRI a CT and I went to eye doctors because it affects the optic nerves in the eye but I had no symptoms of it I had no idea this was supposedly going on but all along very peaceful about it just trusting the Lord that it was nothing and the last appointment was yesterday and I went to see the neurologist and I sat down with my doctor originally and he was showing me where everything was at and the fluid that they saw and and everything but it it wasn't cancerous and so the doc I was the fourth patient and the doctor said well he was really nice and he seemed really happy with the results and everything and he said I I've been able to give two of the four patients um good news and he said I just want to let you know and he showed us all the pictures the scans that got to see inside my brain and all my veins and everything but he said I

to thank the Lord for that uh uh praise report or testimony from Sister Kelly and then uh also uh uh we can make a praise report here tonight for uh sister car and also sister beer and I think the the the night before last uh that was pretty much I think that should be about uh um was that Monday night if I'm right missing my days here but brother uh Wesley called me uh sent me in a text late in the night that uh sister Cara was not feeling well so they had to rush over to the emergency room and I think uh uh uh she was having experiencing uh migraine something that could have led to a man of struck but uh the Lord kind of for intervene and uh uh uh they took her in and she slept at the hospital and then uh Monday before the evening they were back home so we want to thank the Lord for that and then uh also uh sister B called last night too she was not feeling well and uh uh struggling with her breath but uh we want also want to thank the Lord that uh he was able to step in and uh and our sister is able to be in service tonight so we thank the Lord for them praise the Lord he's a faithful God he's a faithful keeper and he's wed of all of our praise amen let's give the Lord a hand of praise praise the Lord amen amen amen uh Sunday uh I forgot to announce that this weekend is when we should have brother doc Baker in so he be flying in on Friday evening and then uh he will spend uh uh the weekend year so we'll have service with him on Saturday night and then Sunday morning but D is from Tucson Arizona and uh uh I think he has some of his growing up days in in some part of Minnesota uh he's from a military family so uh when he's there s here he he have some memories here so he uh wanted to come back and just uh visit so uh uh we've been going back and forth since uh February or uh I think yeah since February uh and then uh we thought he was going to come in the early part of the month month but he had to go to South Korea uh on the missions trip there and then they came back and uh uh we thought that maybe we can be able to have him come and visit with us so let's uh uh uh come and support the services this weekend as the Lord will uh meet us here and bless us praise the Lord Amen Brother Francis went over to speak for brother Brooks this evening he will be flying out tomorrow to kenon there so we we want to thank the Lord for that amen and uh uh praise the Lord what can we say about the service on Sunday amen amen it was it was special in his own way amen it was special in his own way and uh uh I I will say I will make some few comments here and then we will we will pray and look into what we want to talk about about tonight but we we will make this just a prayer meeting since we have Services coming up this weekend I don't want to get into something and then uh uh uh keep you suspended amen we can just take up from where we stopped last Wednesday praise the Lord amen and uh it's it's good to have these brothers coming and uh give us some time of rest but it looks like I'm more tired than if I'm preaching all the time praise the Lord I think I I I thought I was supposed to be resting but it looks like I'm more tired than I supposed to be so but we thank the Lord amen amen I think uh there are some other few things that uh we are trusting the Lord for maybe that's what is making us tile and uh uh thank you musicians let me I keep you sitting here praise the Lord I thought I would do a song before we we we preach like I normally do but uh let's just go right into the service thank you thank you for the music praise the Lord and uh uh I wish I knew uh that uh that was what brother Elijah was going to speak on brother Francis I we have asking to make two services for us Sunday and uh and tonight but we were talking in the M last time he was here he wanted to see brother Brooks and then we couldn't fix it right so it work out this time so he's gone over to speak for brother Brooks and uh uh you know these things happen sometimes it cat you off uh unaware but uh I think uh it was it was uh uh somehow necessary in uh in uh in the way of the subject that he brought in in kind of for looking at things around there praise the Lord Lord and uh we talk about it after the service a little bit and I told him I never thought that I would I would be able to bring out a message on there because it was not a question in my mind it was not a question in my mind but uh uh because many years back uh you know many years back I will always preach and I will say that that if if brother Billy Paul uh should should go to be with the Lord there are a lot of things that could happen after that there are a lot of people that might you know backslide from the message that might you know uh and says uh you know the prophecy never came to pass but I love the way that he brought it out you know in the way where he shows that uh uh whatever what brother brandham let me not say any way whatever but what brother brandham told Bly Paul uh with with uh with uh the testimony report we can say that sh swamp you know in that place you know for those that saw it and you know that Liv through it and also he showed the part of it where he was separating the prophecy where brother Brandon uh said on inspiration you know because brother Bram have made us to understand about the things that he says under inspiration and when he says Thou said the Lord those are the things that do not fail praise the Lord so he was trying to show us uh uh you know uh the prophecy honor thou said the Lord and uh and the timing to that prophecy one thing I I enjoyed during during uh since Sunday was the timing and the timing that he brought under the prophecy was I don't [Music] know that was what brother brandom said I don't know amen and you can go and make a search on it and see how many things things brother bam say I don't know right praise the Lord amen I just looking at a bunch of them and you know when brother brand uh I gave the vision about the boy that should be raised in Finland he said I don't know he says I don't know when it will happen I don't know where it will happen I don't know how it will happen he says but I know it will happen write it on the flight Le of your Bible praise the Lord and uh so in that uh in that light uh he he he spoke a little bit there and uh uh uh talk about you know um um God how God interpret his own word by bringing it to pass praise the Lord so we read I just read a few things here to you before we prayed praise the Lord those in those brother Bram says here and and God doesn't always Reve to his Prophet everything that he has in his divine plan praise the Lord God doesn't always and you will see he he made this statement at attaching to the shite woman going to meet Elijah concerning her the her son amen concerning her son Elisha concerning her son that uh you know uh uh the uh the prophet told her you know she will have a child by this time of the year and and the boy grew and and and he passed and brother B say God never told his Prophet you know until the woman got there he didn't know what to do he gave his time for for uh uh Gesa to go and lay it on the baby until he got there before God gave him an inspiration what to do to raise the boy up so under that he said this over and over uh uh spiritual inspiration God don't always tell his Prophet everything that's going to happen he just tell them as he want to God's sovereign and blind baos he said well God don't always tell his Prophet everything that he does he just tell his Prophet what he want them to know praise the Lord amen and I put uh uh another quote here in the same light of uh God interpreting his word uh uh uh investment he says uh that's what makes the gospel today it's the unusualness because God is unusual his word is interpreted unusual to what we sometimes have it interpreted praise the Lord I think sometimes because of of of of of us being as humans you know it's it's almost like uh uh sometimes you talk to people you know uh the they would love to have a direct instruction from you you know they want you to just tell them you know do it this way praise the Lord and and and and and many times it's is because if it's failed they can hold you responsible you told me to do it like that praise the Lord amen now so uh uh uh this is the same the the the same thought that Paul called the foolishness of preaching brother B is using unusual he says uh his word is uh his word is interpreted unusual to what we sometimes have it interpreted but as I have said before God needs Nobody to interpret his word he does his own interpretation by bringing it to pass the things that he said he would do he interpret his own word he doesn't need our interpretation our interpretation is our own M made thought praise the Lord and every time you hear people around California sinking they always try to tie it to the blasting of the seven Vision because in our mind we want to have it make sense praise the Lord Brother bam saw a big blast and he saw Deb you know he turned around and saw Deb in the seven Vision how how how is that going to happen we always try to make sense that is the way we as humans we operate if we can just narrow it down just to give us a little sense then it's easy for us to follow then it's easy for us to believe that's himon praise the Lord and that's the reason why it takes the new birth for us to walk by faith amen sons of God are led by the spirit of God are we together so our own interpretation is our manmade thought that we can put with it when God said let there be light and there was light that needs no interpretation God said a virgin shall conceive she did that needs no interpretation but mind you people interpreted that scripture I believe no doubt Israel was taken as a type to be the Virgin the Messiah will come through her I mean people had you know different ways they they try to make sense of what God's word says praise the lord we are not called to make sense of it we are called to believe it and just wait on the Lord it even happened to us as as you are praying to God God you are waiting you are waiting uh uh and expecting God to bless you or to visit you when you p a timeline to it if it does not happen then what happen in your mind now you start to believe that it is not the word of God for that to happen for you or because in your human mind you have put a timeline to it so the devil uses that now and start weakening your faith praise the Lord he used that very thing you have to realize brother Braham says he works by the the the Lord of our mind he form that Chanel in the Garden of Eden and he will use it every time he will use it every time he must just get you right in the channel of reasoning he's going to to use it praise the Lord so I think the subject was beautiful because I didn't know that uh there was a bunch of uh you know uh uh statement on the internet you know and and bunch of people you know uh coming back to uh uh California thinking and what brother brandom said about it you know and I mean just just all of that praise the Lord but we want to thank the Lord amen let me read this to you then we will stand and read the word tonight brother BR said this in question and answer he said yeah it just goes to show that people without the baptism and that call to the office of a minister has no business to be in the pit that's right he says I could take that person now the person that that has no right to to handle the word he was saying I could take that person now by the help of God and tie them in such enough it will make their hair swing look I don't care what N I don't mean I that don't sounds right forgive me I didn't mean that Lord I did him I felt him check me on De yes sir praise the Lord see so I didn't mean to say it that way I'm sorry I believe that the Holy Spirit could reveal to that person some secret that sounds better amen he said that sounds better I believe that the Holy Spirit can reveil to that person uh uh the person that that can better explain that subject he says I believe he says I should not make it me that person that is going that that will have a better better understanding on the subject he says I believe the holy spirit will reveal it to that person he says that sounds better is it's just like toning an instrument when you do something wrong and you can tell it as a Christian you say something wrong he didn't like that see that was putting me in there see and in the picture at all don't even want to be myself or nothing just him let him do the work that I mean let him do the work he does the sounding the trumpet is M the voice behind it one that gives the sound praise the Lord now I I I put this in here to be able to to help us to see because you see as we deal with these subjects and these different things that that uh uh and and as as we as we get closer to the rapture and our going home we there there are many things that will become more pler and more clearer to Us Praise the Lord that will become more plainer and more uh uh clear to us and even we was we will better understand the the son of man Ministry praise the Lord so I dropped this right in here to see one of the reason was uh uh uh brother brandham identified the the uh you know the the feeling the check from the Lord that that is a Christian Life to be able to feel it and to be able to identify it right praise the Lord not only when we are talking about the word or when we are talking about the Lord even when we are dealing with one another and we are saying things that we must not say and and we feel the check that is the dealing of the holy spirit it's a sense of maturity praise the Lord amen I can see I I I can see it and I can feel it you know from the from the beginning of the of of reading of the Cod and telling the man in the nor we got excited but when brother Brandon fell check we fail check amen I can tie a man in the knock and swing his head that sounds exciting but when he fell check we also fed check praise the Lord amen but I wonder if we will have fail check even if he did not fail check praise the Lord yes that is our growth in the Lord that's the thing we have to look for every day is the grace of God unto you if you can feel a check of the Holy Spirit let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we want to thank you tonight Lord and and just like we said father we we just want to have a a little fellowship tonight Lord and and uh just by reading that quote Lord we we want to just bring our hearts before you Lord and say father oh God may we not get to the place Lord where we we we grieve you or we are not paying attention when you are bringing certain things and sometimes we just so caught up in ourself that Lord we are not listening and we can in know that still Small Voice because we just want to say what we want to say like the word will say we want to get it off of our chest but father what a better way to get it off of our chest when we can give it to you than to just be in ourself father we commit ourself to you tonight and we pray that Lord God and like your Prophet said Lord the word is our token we must present the token before our prayers Lord and we take that word we take that cat tonight Lord that may it go father before us Lord to the throne of grace and say oh God May our hearts be the heart that you can check Lord our thoughts oh Father you can be able to catch our tongue in the roof of our mouth help us Lord how we need you how we love you how we appreciate you tonight pray that Lord God you come now Lord and take your word to tonight father and just uh break it to our hearts so father Lord what an awesome God you are what a wonderful father we love you tonight thank you oh God for bringing your children Lord and those that are following the service online and from home and in different places we just commit them into your hands Lord father make your word a blessing to every one of us now we love you we thank you we appreciate you father in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you let's stand on our feet tonight and we can read a portion of the word and see if I will be a successful preacher tonight amen I'm aiming for that Mark and I'm praying that God will to help me to be able to get there and preach under 25 minutes amen praise the Lord so if you love me please pray for me amen let's let's turn to the book of neemias tonight let's just read chapter 2 chapter 2 let's read from verse one and it came to pass in the month of naion in the in the 20th year of aesus the king that wine was before him and I took up the wine and gave it unto the king now I had not been Before Time sad in his presence wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou are now sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then I was very so afraid let us pray Heavenly Father we just ask your blessing tonight Lord and we pray that God you will come take your word and bless it to our hearts in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you can have your seat Zachariah chapter 12 Zechariah Chapter 12 uh if you remember last uh Wednesday we were talking about the burden of the word of the Lord amen the burden of the word of the Lord you read through other uh uh uh scripture in in the Bible is is the burden of the Lord uh uh uh uh Jonah had the burden of the Lord to to Nineveh but just like I said last week I love the way that the scripture put it this way the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel amen so we want to continue in that in that talk tonight and and we were looking at that the burden of the word of the Lord and uh uh we spoke a little bit last week on uh uh using type to be able to bring out a sense of the cup of trembling I want to go in that same direction this evening Amen to be able to bring out the the sense of of the cup of trembling what do that signifies when the Bible uh uh led us to know that behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling onto all the people round about praise the Lord so we talk uh uh uh Joseph we we took Joseph in a type of that and we show that how uh uh honor his gift of of dreams and interpreting so what what I'm trying to bring out here for us to be able to understand because I will use fever uh different scriptures as we go into this the Bible says Jerusalem will be a uh a cup of trembling the uh Isaiah said the same thing also and uh uh so uh in the way that we we we try to establish this is that uh uh uh because one they are under the burden of the word of the Lord uh uh that uh the promises that God has made about Jerusalem and all of that and uh and and in the way that we see it with uh uh throughout the scripture is that the cup of trembling unto Israel uh is is for their Redemption praise the Lord the cup of trembling can also be a cup of judgment praise the Lord it can be a cup of uh Redemption and is also a cup of judgment we want to establish that so as we go through the scripture you will uh uh we will be able to point out there little by little but the sense that uh uh uh the my inspiration is now more on the cup my inspiration is being under the burden of the word of the Lord because just like Israel was under the burden of the word of the Lord uh in this in this age is the bride that is under the burden of the word of the Lord amen praise the Lord that burden will return back to Israel but the time of the Gentiles has to be fulfilled for now we are under the burden of the word of the Lord praise the Lord now so in looking at that uh uh I want to take another type here also so we can be able to get more sense in there we see here also how neemias uh we realize that he was a cup Bearer that's why I read that scripture uh tonight because uh it will have to De deal with a cup it will help me to be able to bring out uh uh uh my inspiration on the subject so we see that he was a cupbearer and uh uh and like the scripture says he testified I have never been s died before the Lord he never had a side face maybe he was always a rejoicing man and let me tell you I was as I was uh uh uh studying on this I realized that the job of the cup bearer was such an important job if you just look at the conversation there between the king and neemias you will see how important his job was this was the man that that was sing wine to the king the life of the King was in his hands praise the Lord he could put something in that wine and the king would drink and never wake up tomorrow so it was a very sensitive job and and and one account I was looking at it says the the the cup bearers of those days was most of the time they were they were Uno and their lives was was dedicated to the king praise the Lord just because of the sensitive of their job the life of the King was in their hands they were always before the king so you can see why the king could tell that Nehemiah was sad praise the Lord because if there is something that is worrying this man I must also be worried praise the Lord because if he's bother I don't know what is on his mind it don't make a person to be comfortable to drink from somebody that just have a side face are we together that's just how sensitive that the job of the C the cup bearer was but now as we as we we we we you know uh H looked at in the scripture you will see that uh that sadness that nayas had was because he had a burden concerning Jerusalem praise the Lord after he have heard he have got report that the walls of the city will stay down and and and the city will stay waste the temple everything everything was you know was the land was still wasted it started affecting him praise the Lord amen now you see how how beautiful that God in the way that God uh uh uh uh you know the the the way that he he he quain his word I mean that the design that he put in his word that it will now again become another man that has uh H uh uh the profession of being a cup Bearer it will affect him in such a way that his countenance will be known by the king and the King will call him I've never seen you like this why are you s praise the Lord amen when the when the mother of James the the the the Thunder Brothers came to the Lord Jesus to ask him and she said I want one of my son to sit on your right hand and the other one to sit on on your left hand when you come in your kingdom Jesus said to her can they drink out of the cup that I'm drinking now I believe at the at the at the Lord's supper or at the time that Jesus will be with his disciple in Fellowship together in all of that I believe that uh uh I don't think that they had a special cup just said maybe they had it treat him as he was the master you know well but when Jesus said that we know that he was not speaking of a natural cup praise the Lord Jesus in the time uh uh uh uh that he was he was facing his last hour on the cross I mean under interrogation the wave the the scotching of his beard he said oh Lord let this cup pass over me but Lord not my will let your will be done praise the Lord and which of course also we know that it was not it was not a physical cup it was what he was enduring it was what he was going through praise the Lord so you see in the Old Testament God designed it their way he laid it out in in in types we saw that in in in in Joseph interpreting that dream we saw that in Joseph putting his saver Cup in his uh in his brother's uh sack just so Benjamin and his father can come to the land god designed it that way praise the Lord and you see when I when I when I T about this subject the more I was meditating on it you know I I I think about uh you know the song that we sing uh fill my cup Lord I lift it up Lord praise the Lord amen amen and when we sing that to the Lord we know that our mind is far away from just a natural cup is is is the is is the Deep desire of our soul the longing in our heart the needs of our life we want God to step in our situation and turn it around praise the Lord amen so so I believe uh uh you know God designed the life of his people that way the people that he will burden for set work brother Brandon would describe that uh uh he would talk about the burden of the word of the Lord one of the place I saw that he expressed that was in the message trying to do God a service without being his will he's describing this burden of the Lord and and and and one thing I would say with this thought also you'll realize that uh uh uh this this particular scripture I hope when we get down to look at how malacha express it that is that is one of the place where it really it really describe us because when Malachi let's let's go to Malachi chapter 1 it brings a good picture of of the Gentiles it brings a good picture that speaks to us more than Zacharias chapter 12 because this is the burden of the word of the Lord for isra even though Malachi was speaking to the people of Israel but it has a place there for us Malachi CH 1 verse one the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you said the Lord yet ye say wherein have thou Lov Us Praise the Lord so can you just just get the picture now God has burdened the heart of this Prophet remember now Israel has just come out of the they have come out of asile they have gone through the Babylonian we they have gone through everything that they have suffered praise the Lord amen because Malachi and all of that they were right around the same time of of uh uh nemias and Ezra the rebuilding of the temple and all of that all of that they were right around that same time when Israel has come out of uh Babylon now this Prophet is now burden to be he has a burden on his heart to be able to help these people out of captivity to make sense of all the things that they have gone through to be able to turn their their their their their captivity to understand that this was the love of God praise the Lord what a job that God will burden this man to be able to bring a word to the people some have lost their wives they have lost their children they have lost their homes were destroyed praise the Lord they are coming back and rebuilding nothing in their hands but yet this Prophet is is uh is having this burden on his hand your work is to help these people understand whatever question that is on their mind praise the Lord amen and I will say the same think uh uh uh in the sense of what our brother preach on on Sunday in in some way brother Elijah was coming from uh uh a person a spot I remember a couple years ago all of those things of believe the sign affected brother Elijah I remember one year he called me he called me on the phone when he when he started asking me you know he was just throwing questions to me and asking wow you know what is this what is it I'm hearing what is this and it really affected him some of the negative things that that that was said you know uh uh really really so so the his his expression the passion that he preached with he was coming from that place of a burden praise the Lord because uh uh it affected him not only his mind it also affected his health now so uh uh here is Malachi coming coming here with uh Burden Burden with the word of the Lord for Israel I have L you said the Lord and yeah said God reading the minds of the people why are we going to church is this God really Our God see our land how can the god of the universe sit there and we are called his people and the land is wasted and Mal H this burden now to be able to help the people to understand how can you trans you know translate this thing to the love of God how can you be able to see the love of God in your trials praise the Lord that's exactly where the Malachi was yes say wherein have thou love us was not Eau Jacob's brother said the Lord yet I love Jacob God H this burden that's that's the reason why I feel like we can more relate to this because God is is is going to bring to Israel to understand his elective love amen he's going to help Israel to see his love of election so Malachi is laboring on this my job my burden can you can you re can you imagine he waking up every morning and thinking how to bring this message to these people how to make them to understand that this was the love of God praise the Lord many times our trials look to us like punishment and that's the reason why sometimes and many times when we Face them we try to look in our life what have I done praise the Lord but Malachi is burden to be able to help this people that are returning back to understand that this was God's elective love praise the Lord this was God's love so he's he's hon this burden now so let me just read this quote to you uh I'm having a few minutes here now so brother Brandon now is is now going to help us to see just like how the prophets spiritually they were not carrying anything it was something that was a burden on their heart they were burden with that on their heart just like the prophet were burden spiritually with the word of the Lord he's going to help us suceed in type is the same way that the priests were ordained to carry the Ark of the Covenant praise the Lord and he's going to show us in the word that the that the priest was supposed to carry the act on their shoulder which their shoulder is just above their heart so the ACT represent the word amen and they were they were ordained they were men that were called and were ordained to be able to carry the Ark of the Lord so that's what he's going to bring here but the the actual thought behind it he's going to let us to see that's how the burden of the word is carried so he speak six year and and and and and getting the story we we we know the background of that instead of putting the act in its original position he carry it on a new C and not over the hearts of the Levites praise the Lord amen I've always wondered in my mind why David make their choice and I and and and I I've I've I've taught him mind there could it be because the Philistine returned the Ark of the cant on a c praise the Lord the Bible says they went to their gods and their idols and and and and and the prayed and says you have to send the the the the the ACT back to to to Israel this is the thing that is making trouble in the camp praise the Lord and the Bible says the bill a new car that nothing has been rolled on they P the AR there and the AR went directly back praise the Lord you see because those people were not ordained to handle the ark right they had no instruction to handle the AR they were not ordained to handle the AR and God directed the C to bring the AR right back to where it's supposed to be praise the Lord then how can the church now take the example of the word because it work for them right how can we replace God ordained order right when God instructed the the the Moses in the Tabernacle how the ACT supposed to be carried right you see how easily we can copy from the word just because we think it work for them but it's in the word praise the lord it's in the word that's the reason why God gave us his word because he don't want us to guess he gave us the order and instruction in his word for to go right back to the word and do it the way he says it because that's how that's what he's going to bless praise the Lord instead of putting the Ark in his original position he carry it on a new C and not over the hearts of the Levites it it was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the Levites which is over the heart the word is not in the mind it's in the heart not on the new C is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the heart of man amen and not in some uh uh uh ecclesial move the holy spirit is a treasure of God's love in the heart of men and women to obey praise the Lord I believe that's worth reading again the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is a treasure of God's love in the heart of men and women to obey praise the Lord was on the shoulders of his ministry his Minister was the Levites put it over their shoulder over their left shoulder and Park the act like that because it was up over their heart they had the burden of the word on their heart so you see he's bringing he's bringing that Old Testament type of how the prophets have the burden of the Lord playing out in the in on uh the prophets and then playing out in the priesthood how the priest was supposed to carry the Ark of the Covenant over their left shoulder as over their heart praise the Lord they have the burden of the word of the Lord on their heart now you got to now you got the burden of your denomination on your heart okay or the burden of your congregation whether you are going to build this or do that or or do something else the burden of how many more you are going to get to your denomination instead of the burden of the word now I put this quote here uh uh uh because in one sense you know sometimes you you you are steud to preach and at the same time the word is dealing with you praise the Lord amen so as I was as I was studying this and uh and just looking at this it's truth looking at the burden of the word but like brother brandham says here and I was just uh uh fellowshipping with my friend today and as we're driving down I was we were talking to something I was just sharing with him how much I see that uh you know brother bam talks about the last day spirit and and and how the last day spirit is creeping on the church and I and I and I and and and I was thinking about this uh uh Sometimes some sometime ago and I was sharing with him I says do you realize that uh when you think about uh the men that were burdened with the word I we were just talking in a sense of you know ministerial class and men that took the Revival and how these guys I mean they spend their life they spend their money they spend everything that they have for the kingdom I think that this age is so affected by its spirit praise the Lord that is is it has put us to the place where uh uh uh uh contentment amen is no longer a Christian character praise the Lord the word has required us for us to be content but the the the the the spirit of the age is just cloud in the minds of the people our age is a rich age is it's a age of sufficiency it's a age of new invent praise the Lord and sometimes a cloud the minds of the people that I mean like just just like uh uh brother brandom says here is gone from us having the burden of the word we are more burdened about how big our congregation can be what a big church that we can have you know uh uh and and it is just all on the kind of a physical demonstration or physical H HH appearance you got the burden of your denomination on your heart the burden of your congregation whether you are going to build this or do that nothing wrong with that praise the Lord as long as the burden of the word is what is driving us amen nothing wrong with that unless I mean unless uh we uh we uh we we are losing the burden of the word and that is some of the reason why we have all of the different things that we are seeing that is creeping into our ranks and and you know and getting them more the people of God is because the burden of the word we have moved from the burden of the word the burden of how many more you are going to get into your denomination instead of the burden of the word that the people will see only the word of God and nothing else praise the Lord oh I pray that there would be our emphasis amen I pray that that would be the reason why we are coming here is to be able to lift up the word praise the Lord hallelujah and every one of us have a responsibility to do that and and and and I mean h h h uh the the most of the responsibility is left on us when we leave this building praise the Lord how do we represent the word at home in different places let me get through this instead of the burd of the word of the Lord that the people will see only the word of God and nothing else but you you have got it on the new cury they are pking it up here in the Inc communal Council even shoulder I don't want to get critical and may God help me now I just tell you the truth instead of putting the AR in its original position he carry it on the new card and not over the hearts of the Levites it was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the Levites over their heart the word is not in the mind is in the heart not on the new card amen praise the Lord just as simple as that we have to come back to the word we have to do things by the word that is just as simple because God is going to bless his word all the time it is now how smart we get of how we want to lead the church and what we can do for the church to be spiritual and what we can do what what we need to do is to just come back to the word line our life when the Holy Spirit check us let's say amen and surrounder to the word praise the Lord when the Holy Ghost check us on whatever it is the more we find reason of why we are doing that that is that is the more we get away from the Lord the more we find reason why we should do that we are not giving him chance to have preeminence in in our lives the prophet speaks about the small state voice it is something that we have to train ourself to just like Samuel was trained to hear the voice of God he was trained to hear it Eli trained him and the Holy Ghost is here to train us to hear that voice if he check us it must not be difficult for us for you to say I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that Lord I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that praise the Lord because if we don't do that and we we we keep giving ourself reason and I I don't care what anybody say you are just building a new car to carry the word and just like that c caused the life of somebody it might cost the life of somebody or cost your own life that's what that's what a new idea will do praise the lord we will always have a reason remember it's one of our Saints it's one of our Saints if it was enough to lead us God wouldn't give us his word we will always have a reason why we are doing what we are doing or why we are not doing what is expected of Us Praise the Lord musicians you can come let's s our hearts to the Lord in prayer tonight we can pray for the services this on the weekend and uh fill my cup Lord I leave it up [Music] for let's worship him in our own way tonight feel my C Lord I Live It Up Lord come and qu the teing of my soul

word before [Music] me Wherever We Are Tonight with our hairs B our hearts [Music] B and I believe that's the reason why that small state voice will come I believe that's the reason why God will give you a check because he wants our hearts to be right to carry the word he don't want the word to be carried on the Proud Spirit he don't want the word to be carried on the selfish spirit and that goes for everyone of us whether we are preachers whether we are song leaders we just don't come with our own ideas we have to find out how am I going to lead these people even as parents in our home as husbands to our wife as mothers to our [Music] children the internet is filled with all sorts of offensive instruction how relationship Works how marriage [Music] works and we can we can gather all of those things and we can listen to all of those things but if it's not the word it will not be able to sustain it it will carry it for the wi and it will be shaken if you are just trying to use your ideas it will just go for the wi and it will be shaken it will cause the life of someone we have to trust the Lord [Music] and we have to ask the Lord we have to place it before the Lord God ordained the priest to carry the word men shall live by only the word not by bread alone but by the word of God God ordained your soul to only Fe on the word no kind of Internet thought it was it will sound
