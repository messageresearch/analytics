[44:02] brothers after the service
[44:05] and we want to talk about uh
[44:08] we're getting into the cold season uh
[44:12] uh we pretty soon we'll be taking the
[44:14] tank down
[44:15] from the back there so we have to trust
[44:18] the law to see
[44:19] how we will you know
[44:22] organize our service and and accommodate
[44:25] ourselves so
[44:26] that's what we want to just talk about
[44:29] right after the service with all of the
[44:30] brothers
[44:31] and then we will now bring them out
[44:34] before the church
[44:36] revelation chapter 9 that's what i'll be
[44:38] reading from this morning
[44:40] and praise the lord praise the lord
[44:46] amen praise the lord revelation chapter
[44:50] 9. so one of the things that we might
[44:54] also
[44:55] discuss is how we will approach our
[45:00] communion service during the lockdown it
[45:03] didn't that stop
[45:04] us from having communion service we took
[45:06] it the bible way we went from house to
[45:08] house
[45:09] so we were able to gather families and
[45:11] you know bring people
[45:13] together in the same area in into a home
[45:16] you know and then we we we did that so
[45:19] uh
[45:20] maybe we might take that approach until
[45:23] this entire kovic cloud is lifted from
[45:26] over us
[45:27] praise the lord by the by the way there
[45:30] we had a community service with uh
[45:32] bro wesley and sister carrick they've
[45:34] been they've been wanting to do that
[45:37] uh since they missed the last communion
[45:39] service so thursday night
[45:41] they were able to do a birthday party
[45:43] for me at the house
[45:44] and and the convenience service after so
[45:47] i was grateful for that
[45:48] amen revelation chapter nine let's
[45:51] reverse one
[45:52] that i won't keep you standing very long
[45:59] and the fifth angel sounded and i saw
[46:03] a star fall from heaven
[46:06] onto the earth and to him was giving
[46:10] the key of the bottomless pit
[46:15] to him was giving the key of the
[46:17] bottomless pit
[46:19] and he opened the bottomless pit
[46:22] and there rose a smoke
[46:26] out of the pay as the smoke of
[46:30] a great furnace and
[46:33] the sun and the air
[46:37] were darkened by reason
[46:41] of the smoke of the path
[46:46] and they came out of the small locust
[46:49] upon the earth and unto them was giving
[46:53] power as the scorpions of the earth have
[46:57] power
[46:58] and it was commanded them that they
[47:01] should not hurt the grass of the earth
[47:05] neither any green things neither any
[47:08] tree
[47:10] but only those men which have
[47:13] not the seal of god

[48:46] this morning i want to take a little
[48:48] subject that i tied to
[48:50] smoke disaster
[48:53] i want to talk on smoke disaster
[49:00] i want to talk on smoke disaster
[49:04] and i took this little thought from uh
[49:07] uh i was i was looking at uh
[49:14] our
[49:16] going through some of our oil tapes uh
[49:19] all services that were recorded on on
[49:22] those
[49:23] cassette tapes and i was playing one of
[49:25] them in
[49:26] in the vehicle uh you know you know
[49:29] sometimes you you listen to yourself you
[49:31] say oh god
[49:32] this young man needs help amen praise
[49:35] the lord
[49:36] say oh god this young man needs help
[49:38] please help me lord jesus
[49:41] amen but then i took uh i was
[49:44] just listening to to one of those
[49:46] services we had and
[49:48] and that's what i took this this uh this
[49:51] inspiration from
[49:53] and i went back and and started looking
[49:55] at uh some few things
[49:57] there and then also i i
[50:00] decided to to look at uh uh
[50:04] some documentaries on uh on on smoke
[50:08] disasters
[50:09] because uh i was i was listening to
[50:12] a report one time and i think out of
[50:15] california
[50:16] and with all of the fire going there you
[50:19] know
[50:21] and
[50:23] [Music]
[50:25] you know a lot of the things that that
[50:27] you know that can go wrong
[50:30] i was talking with uh one of my little
[50:32] sisters that lived there
[50:34] in california and she was telling me you
[50:36] know
[50:37] how when they wake up in the morning uh
[50:40] you notice the
[50:41] they see their whole vehicles are
[50:44] covered with arches just like we have
[50:46] our cars covered with snow
[50:48] you know and i mean the place was just
[50:51] so
[50:52] smoky you know and and and
[50:55] you know visibility was not good you can
[50:57] hardly see
[50:58] and i think there was a day
[51:03] here in minneapolis that the weather
[51:06] reported that visibility in the morning
[51:10] was affected
[51:11] because of the smoke from california
[51:14] you know that was just how serious it
[51:16] was and
[51:17] and and and the thing that prove it
[51:20] again is because i had a
[51:22] i have a friend that worked with uh
[51:25] with fedex through the airport and uh
[51:28] and he was telling me you know that
[51:30] morning
[51:31] uh they were wondering what was
[51:33] happening you know because i mean the
[51:35] visibility
[51:36] outside was not good but yet they could
[51:39] smell
[51:41] you know the smoke in the end
[51:44] praise the lord you know so uh
[51:47] [Music]
[51:48] and and uh in in
[51:52] a natural disaster you know smoke
[51:55] disaster
[51:56] also has been proven to be to be very
[51:59] dangerous
[52:00] most especially in in you know in fire
[52:04] uh you know where there is a disaster of
[52:07] fire whether it's a house burn
[52:10] or you know uh uh you know what like the
[52:13] fire going on in california
[52:17] what affects the people is the smoke
[52:22] praise the lord the people can get away
[52:25] from the fire
[52:27] if they are able to keep themselves from
[52:29] the smoke
[52:31] but when you start in hitting that smoke
[52:35] you know and and it gets into your
[52:38] system
[52:39] it start weakening you
[52:43] praise the lord you know you can run for
[52:47] fire
[52:47] you can run from fire but you can run
[52:51] from smoke
[52:53] because for you to run you need to
[52:55] breathe
[52:58] and the smoke is already in the air
[53:05] 1948 in pennsylvania there was
[53:08] there was uh there was a disaster
[53:13] that was called the smok disaster
[53:17] somg
[53:21] no smog sorry
[53:24] it was called a smug disaster and and
[53:27] this
[53:27] disaster for for many times because at
[53:31] that time there was there was a plant a
[53:33] steel plant
[53:34] in in pennsylvania and that was one of
[53:38] the
[53:39] you know it was it was it was helping
[53:42] the economy at that time
[53:44] so when this happened because i mean the
[53:48] people woke up that morning
[53:49] and the and the whole setting you know
[53:52] was just
[53:53] on a smoke so everybody was looking at
[53:57] the plant
[53:58] they thought that the problem was coming
[54:00] from the plant
[54:02] and it was it was after many years
[54:05] before they realized
[54:06] that no the problem was not coming from
[54:09] the plant
[54:10] it was it was a natural disaster
[54:13] what happened is that it was it was f
[54:16] temperature
[54:17] you know according to to the history of
[54:20] the documentary
[54:21] the rest of the states in america was
[54:24] fine
[54:24] but right in that city in
[54:28] in in pennsylvania right in that city
[54:31] the air just hovered over that city and
[54:34] it was not moving for some reason
[54:36] and it just it just created you know
[54:39] that
[54:40] that smoke and people lost their life
[54:42] also
[54:43] i mean it was so and then in 1952
[54:47] london also had the same thing praise
[54:51] the lord
[54:52] not london had the same disaster like
[54:55] that
[54:56] you know uh that that just that just
[54:58] naturally came from
[54:59] from from air temperature praise the
[55:02] lord
[55:03] but this morning we want to look at uh
[55:07] you know smoke disaster uh revelation
[55:10] chapter nine smoke disaster that's the
[55:12] way i would like to
[55:14] tie to it praise the lord amen
[55:18] and uh and one thing that is common
[55:23] in smoke disaster is that everybody wear
[55:25] max
[55:28] that's one thing that is common so if
[55:31] you cannot see it there is no way
[55:34] i can make this scripture ever clearer
[55:37] to you than for you to look at yourself
[55:39] very much
[55:40] amen we are in a smoke disaster
[55:44] but this is a spiritual smoke disaster
[55:46] and that's what we want to talk about
[55:51] by the help of the lord brother dan was

[57:11] in our hands
[57:12] we can have the tips of the prophet we
[57:14] can have brother brandon picture we can
[57:16] but if he destroy the confidence in the
[57:19] word
[57:20] then the word is useless
[57:26] praise the lord and the way that the
[57:29] enemy can destroy the confidence in the
[57:31] world
[57:32] is either pushing the promise to the
[57:34] future

[1:02:45] now brother branham gave i mean god gave
[1:02:48] brother branham a dream a vision
[1:02:50] about crossing over jordan
[1:02:55] and in in in the vision
[1:02:58] he heard a voice told him about crossing
[1:03:01] over
[1:03:02] jody and and
[1:03:05] and when he was about to cross over
[1:03:07] jordan that
[1:03:08] that is the vision that came the the
[1:03:10] mamba snake
[1:03:13] okay so the mamba snake was trying to
[1:03:16] attack him
[1:03:17] so so in in the vision the
[1:03:19] interpretation was
[1:03:21] the the the the mamba snake that
[1:03:23] represent the enemy was trying to stop
[1:03:25] him
[1:03:26] from going over jordan and we have to
[1:03:28] realize
[1:03:29] it is across jordan last our inheritance
[1:03:34] amen our inheritance lies across jordan
[1:03:38] our inheritance lies in the holy ghost
[1:03:43] we must go beyond church members
[1:03:46] and go into the baptising of the holy
[1:03:48] ghost
[1:03:50] that's where our inheritance lands
[1:03:53] now so here is this mamba snake was
[1:03:56] trying to stop him from going
[1:03:58] and uh uh and and he says what it was it
[1:04:02] was it was a dangerous snake and
[1:04:04] and uh uh you know approaching and and
[1:04:06] the lord kind of for helping
[1:04:08] you know uh and he rebuked he says when
[1:04:10] i rebuked the snake in the name of the
[1:04:12] lord jesus
[1:04:12] it gets very small
[1:04:16] praise the lord and then it bounced back
[1:04:18] up again
[1:04:20] but he was with some other brothers
[1:04:22] praise the lord
[1:04:23] and the snake left him and started but
[1:04:26] when he came
[1:04:27] out of that vision you know
[1:04:30] all right in that vision before he came
[1:04:32] out of the vision the holy spirit told
[1:04:34] him
[1:04:35] if you can be more sincere
[1:04:41] if you can be more sincere there is
[1:04:44] nothing
[1:04:46] there is nothing that can bring us in
[1:04:49] the place
[1:04:50] of our inheritance
[1:04:54] then being sincere
[1:04:59] are we together praise the lord i'm
[1:05:02] hoping and praying that the lord will be

[1:11:25] things come it don't spare
[1:11:27] anybody no matter what is your status
[1:11:31] called
[1:11:32] the only thing that keeps you away from
[1:11:35] it is the seal of god
[1:11:37] [Music]
[1:11:38] the only thing that keeps you away from
[1:11:41] it
[1:11:42] is the seal of god which is the baptism
[1:11:45] of the holy ghost
[1:11:48] amen amen
[1:11:52] praise the lord amen and with all of
[1:11:55] these things we we
[1:11:56] we know the prime minister there in in
[1:11:58] in the uk
[1:11:59] came down with faith and i think the uh
[1:12:02] uh brazil president and a lot of a lot
[1:12:04] of the
[1:12:05] you know big mans of the earth but
[1:12:07] that's what the prophet of god is saying
[1:12:09] here
[1:12:10] that's what he's addressing here when
[1:12:13] the lead is taken out of hell
[1:12:15] and and the smoke starts to pour out
[1:12:21] the only people that survive the smoke
[1:12:25] disaster are those

[1:12:56] praise the lord and you know that and
[1:12:58] that that was just how this
[1:12:59] this this inspiration struck me about
[1:13:02] this smoke the
[1:13:03] disaster because what happened is that
[1:13:05] when a smoke disaster comes
[1:13:07] in a home the only thing that i save
[1:13:11] is those food that are sealed
[1:13:15] and a smoke disaster is so
[1:13:19] terrible that a leaf
[1:13:22] a leaf is print everywhere

[1:13:32] they sent leave on your clothes
[1:13:36] praise the lord amen
[1:13:41] everything you tried to drink or saw
[1:13:43] there is just some kind of a taste of
[1:13:45] burn

[1:13:51] experienced that or if you have ever
[1:13:53] been around a fire
[1:13:56] you know a disaster where there was
[1:13:58] smoke all over the place i mean
[1:14:00] it's it leaves a spring everywhere
[1:14:03] nothing is untouched
[1:14:07] the only thing that that are not touched
[1:14:11] are those things that are sealed
[1:14:16] it might affect the outside but it
[1:14:18] cannot get
[1:14:19] inside because it's sealed
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:24] the bottle might smell like it
[1:14:28] but the spiciness is still inside the
[1:14:30] butt
[1:14:32] oh glory be to god amen
[1:14:38] oh praise the lord my my my my mind
[1:14:45] praise the lord are we together
[1:14:49] amen amen
[1:14:57] on change i mean uh on
[1:15:00] unchangeable word of god what brandon

[1:15:05] angels
[1:15:06] don't visit the churches that's the
[1:15:09] reason
[1:15:10] angels don't visit homes we have got to
[1:15:13] get down
[1:15:15] to deep sincerity
[1:15:18] of this thing
[1:15:22] praise the lord what is happening i mean
[1:15:26] where we are now in time people
[1:15:29] where we are now in time
[1:15:34] there are a lot of things that are
[1:15:35] happening behind the scenes
[1:15:39] amen there are a lot of things you
[1:15:41] remember
[1:15:42] branham says we are going to go through
[1:15:44] deep waters
[1:15:50] and why are we saying these things
[1:15:53] to be able to to bust your faith this
[1:15:55] morning
[1:16:01] praise the lord amen
[1:16:05] just to be able to boost your faith he
[1:16:07] says that's the reason why his
[1:16:08] uh uh angels don't visit our homes we
[1:16:12] have got to get down to deep
[1:16:14] sincerity on the on on this thing the
[1:16:16] angel of god
[1:16:18] a year on earth tonight just the same
[1:16:21] as they have always been the holy ghost

[1:16:26] resurrection of jesus christ
[1:16:29] and and and and the coming forth of
[1:16:32] pentecost
[1:16:34] he's appeared true the ages are down
[1:16:38] getting a remnant of people together the
[1:16:41] rest
[1:16:42] of it is uh uh kind of father he says
[1:16:46] i would just tell you that praise the
[1:16:48] lord
[1:16:49] he says uh uh is a father that
[1:16:53] there will mix with smoke out of
[1:16:57] torment yes sir
[1:17:00] it will take a born-again experience
[1:17:04] a born-again experience watched in the
[1:17:07] blood of the lamb
[1:17:10] sanctified filled with the holy ghost or
[1:17:12] they will
[1:17:13] never make that rapture
[1:17:17] or in another sense who says that's what
[1:17:20] it would take or else
[1:17:21] you will never get out of this smoke
[1:17:24] disaster
[1:17:28] that's what it takes to survive this
[1:17:31] smoke disaster that is on the world
[1:17:36] it's a spiritual smoke disaster that
[1:17:38] that brett brown says
[1:17:39] is it's mix and we're going to talk
[1:17:42] about the mixing of political religious
[1:17:46] powers amen
[1:17:50] the mixing of of uh
[1:17:54] political uh religious
[1:17:57] and uh and there's another one there
[1:18:00] but i i don't want to get ahead of
[1:18:02] myself
[1:18:04] i'm just i'm just kind of for saying
[1:18:05] this so to to make us to see
[1:18:08] that uh you know we are we are praying
[1:18:11] and i believe
[1:18:13] i believe that god is going to give us
[1:18:16] uh you know a waving uh you know uh
[1:18:19] uh we might go back to now weary max and
[1:18:24] and but until before we get there i mean
[1:18:27] there are a lot of things that is
[1:18:28] happening
[1:18:29] you know uh i mean a lot of things is
[1:18:31] behind this and
[1:18:32] and one of the great things there also
[1:18:34] is that
[1:18:35] the devil is using this to plague the
[1:18:38] world with fear
[1:18:42] he's using this to plague the world with
[1:18:45] fear
[1:18:46] and just like brother branham says
[1:18:48] that's where the battle is
[1:18:52] amen god is bringing his word he's
[1:18:55] showing
[1:18:55] us i told you we will get down to this
[1:18:57] place
[1:18:59] i said it to you we will get down to
[1:19:01] this place
[1:19:03] it's just like jeremiah was warning the
[1:19:05] people and telling them
[1:19:06] the lion from the north is coming
[1:19:08] talking about babylon
[1:19:10] he was telling them all of these things
[1:19:11] and the religious people they were just
[1:19:13] plain religious we are god's people
[1:19:15] we are in the message you know and he
[1:19:17] was saying they never took it real
[1:19:21] but when the captivity came it swept
[1:19:24] every one of them
[1:19:27] and swept him
[1:19:31] praise the lord

[1:19:48] work and
[1:19:49] and and uh the students have to go to
[1:19:51] school and
[1:19:52] and and and i mean we are living in this
[1:19:54] world
[1:19:57] we are living in this world
[1:20:01] praise the lord
[1:20:04] we can lock ours we we cannot lock
[1:20:06] ourselves
[1:20:07] up you know in the house or in the room
[1:20:09] and says well that
[1:20:11] you know and that is the thing that will
[1:20:12] save us no
[1:20:14] praise the lord the thing that will save
[1:20:16] you is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:19] just when the this whole thing started
[1:20:22] there was a lady that complained there
[1:20:23] in north carolina
[1:20:25] right right from the very time she heard
[1:20:27] you know
[1:20:28] uh i think she got some relative that
[1:20:31] told her about
[1:20:32] everything happening there in china even
[1:20:34] just before we started experiencing
[1:20:35] everything
[1:20:36] in north carolina she she sealed her
[1:20:38] house locked herself and she was right
[1:20:39] in the house and she got covered
[1:20:48] praise the lord you're right in the
[1:20:49] house and she got coffee
[1:20:51] i read that on the news field of morning
[1:20:53] you know this woman complaining
[1:20:55] and you know how did it happen i never
[1:20:57] left my house
[1:21:11] praise the lord says when jesus when he
[1:21:15] resurrected
[1:21:17] and met the disciples the bible says
[1:21:20] when he met them
[1:21:22] the scripture says he breathed upon them
[1:21:26] and he says receive you the holy ghost
[1:21:30] that's the that's the bride us again
[1:21:34] in a smoke disaster we need an oxygen
[1:21:36] kian
[1:21:37] and the arson yanking is to breathe the
[1:21:39] promised promises of god
[1:21:42] amen is to brief on god's promises yes
[1:21:45] amen amen yes
[1:21:51] we will do everything we take all the
[1:21:53] measures we do
[1:21:54] everything that is required of us to do
[1:21:59] but there is there is a thing that is
[1:22:01] most important
[1:22:03] is breathing on those promises in the
[1:22:06] morning
[1:22:06] breathe in your oxygen
[1:22:10] amen take the word of god look for the
[1:22:12] promise and breathe in that oxygen
[1:22:24] glory be to god amen
[1:22:28] let's travel a little bit here daniel
[1:22:30] chapter seven
[1:22:32] because this is the way that i go and i
[1:22:34] don't even start preaching yet
[1:22:38] daniel chapter 7
[1:22:45] are we together
[1:22:49] now you we have to know that brother
[1:22:50] branham taught us
[1:22:52] by the message that that
[1:22:56] the beginning of the gentile kingdom
[1:22:58] started in the book of daniel
[1:23:00] amen it started in the book of daniel
[1:23:03] when god
[1:23:04] gave nebuchadnezzar a dream
[1:23:09] and we all know about nebuchadnezzar
[1:23:11] dream
[1:23:12] that he had the dream that troubled him
[1:23:15] amen
[1:23:16] his dream troubled him he was so
[1:23:19] troubled that when he came
[1:23:20] out of sleep he could not remember the
[1:23:23] dream
[1:23:26] and that was what he sent for the wise
[1:23:29] men
[1:23:31] and the requirement was they had to tell
[1:23:33] him his dream
[1:23:34] and tell him the interpretation that's
[1:23:37] the king
[1:23:37] what are you talking about tell you your
[1:23:39] dream
[1:23:41] at least if you can tell us the dream we
[1:23:42] can figure out what it means
[1:23:45] but you can't remember the thing that
[1:23:46] you say we should tell you the dream
[1:23:50] but because he was so troubled
[1:23:54] just think about it he put those men
[1:23:57] life on their own head because he was so
[1:24:01] troubled
[1:24:02] and that's what god does when god is
[1:24:05] doing something around your life
[1:24:07] he make you so troubled until you feel
[1:24:10] like
[1:24:11] this is your last day on earth i mean he
[1:24:14] trouble you food does not taste good in
[1:24:16] your mouth
[1:24:18] sleep is not restful to your body and
[1:24:21] when a person gets into that condition
[1:24:24] it means that god is dealing with you
[1:24:26] you remember what brother
[1:24:27] i'm talking about zacchaeus when
[1:24:29] zacchaeus wife was praying for him
[1:24:31] he said when he turned like this he rode
[1:24:33] on the bed
[1:24:34] he turned like this he get up he go to
[1:24:37] the bathroom he comes back again he
[1:24:39] tried to sleep he lay his hands like
[1:24:40] this
[1:24:41] until he got to wake up early in the
[1:24:42] morning to go and find that jesus
[1:24:46] god knows how to make a man restless
[1:24:52] amen he knows how to make immortal
[1:24:56] restless
[1:24:59] glory be to god sometimes he would just
[1:25:02] it would just be like a desire
[1:25:04] and sometimes you think maybe it's money
[1:25:07] but you start getting money you realize
[1:25:08] hey i've not failed that desire
[1:25:10] sometimes you think maybe
[1:25:11] it's marriage you get married i have not
[1:25:13] feel that desire sometimes you think
[1:25:14] it's the nesting and you get it but it
[1:25:16] is god just staring
[1:25:18] he knows how to get down in the cells of
[1:25:20] our body
[1:25:21] and makes us uncomfortable and get out
[1:25:24] to the place to seek his face
[1:25:27] he knows how to do it
[1:25:30] that's why paul said it's a fearful
[1:25:32] thing to fall in the hands of the living
[1:25:35] god
[1:25:37] nebuchadnezzar god so troubled so so
[1:25:40] trouble
[1:25:42] he says if you don't tell me my dream
[1:25:44] and
[1:25:45] interpretation your hairs are off
[1:25:51] then they knew that it was serious
[1:25:55] then they knew that it was serious
[1:25:58] praise the lord amen nobody could do it
[1:26:02] but daniel was also part of the council
[1:26:05] and
[1:26:06] so that's how the mother reached down
[1:26:08] here and he was brought into
[1:26:10] into all of this but you see that like
[1:26:14] brother brown says he says
[1:26:15] that's that's the way that divine gave
[1:26:17] operator i just heard him say that
[1:26:20] on blasphemous name uh a couple of days
[1:26:23] i was listening to it
[1:26:24] he says he said that's how the divine
[1:26:26] gave operates
[1:26:28] he says you cannot be able to bring an
[1:26:30] interpretation until god gave you that
[1:26:32] dream
[1:26:34] you have to dream the dream
[1:26:38] you have to dream you have to see what
[1:26:40] the president saw
[1:26:44] he says the brother came to me a couple
[1:26:46] of days ago and he told me in a dream
[1:26:48] and he left something up and i told him
[1:26:50] i said brother
[1:26:51] what's about this and this was in that
[1:26:53] part of your dream
[1:26:56] thank you lord so down here had to dream
[1:27:00] the dream
[1:27:02] praise the lord i've been i've been kind
[1:27:04] of looking into dreams and vision a
[1:27:06] little bit
[1:27:07] you know i i said we're going to preach
[1:27:09] a message your dream will put you in
[1:27:10] prison
[1:27:11] and your dream might get you out amen
[1:27:14] but daniel dreamed the dream
[1:27:18] and and and and also got
[1:27:21] the interpretation by dream amen
[1:27:25] and and a dream
[1:27:28] that's that's that's where it comes into
[1:27:30] a vision you know a dream
[1:27:32] when a person dreams the dream and uh
[1:27:35] and it comes to pass just the way it is
[1:27:38] then it it's an it's a vision it's a
[1:27:41] secondary vision brother branham said
[1:27:43] now so uh uh let me not go into all of
[1:27:46] that you know that but what i
[1:27:48] wanted to for us to look at is that in
[1:27:51] the
[1:27:51] in the in the image in in nebuchadnezzar

[1:28:32] some sense of superpower they must be
[1:28:35] influenced
[1:28:36] they must come under one of those
[1:28:39] nations
[1:28:40] in nebuchadnezzar's dream

[1:28:48] breadth of savior
[1:28:50] the lens of brides and
[1:28:53] the legs of iron praise the lord

[1:29:14] silver is higher than brass
[1:29:17] brass is higher than iron
[1:29:21] but look at this other weight again
[1:29:25] saver is stronger than go
[1:29:30] brass is stronger than silver
[1:29:34] and iron is stronger than all
[1:29:40] are we together if i'm not i'm not going
[1:29:43] to the whole thing but i want to grab
[1:29:44] your attention here
[1:29:46] is that the lesser
[1:29:51] the precious tone the harder it is
[1:29:57] the lesser the precious tone the more
[1:30:01] harder it is

[1:30:10] we know that uh
[1:30:13] babylon was the
[1:30:16] the kingdom of gold the head of gold
[1:30:21] saver was the the median person
[1:30:26] they were the kingdom of sivir uh

[1:30:38] now so but what what was god
[1:30:42] showing uh a down here concerning the
[1:30:46] gentile kingdom concerning our kingdom
[1:30:48] remember now
[1:30:50] uh down in chapter 12 he told him that
[1:30:52] seal of the book
[1:30:54] for these things will be revealed in the
[1:30:55] end now i'm going to read something to
[1:30:57] you from brother branham but i'm trying
[1:30:59] to build
[1:30:59] this uh platform here because i i don't
[1:31:02] have all the time
[1:31:03] to uh for us to to uh
[1:31:06] you know travel in this now so we
[1:31:09] realized that
[1:31:12] uh a stone was cut
[1:31:15] off the mountain amen
[1:31:18] in in in the booking as a dream and that
[1:31:21] stone
[1:31:22] splashed the image
[1:31:25] and when it smashed the image it smashed
[1:31:27] the image on the legs
[1:31:30] amen and then it started breaking
[1:31:34] from the goal to the silver
[1:31:37] to the brass and everything just
[1:31:41] crumbled down everything just
[1:31:44] condensed
[1:31:47] amen it just condensed
[1:31:50] and became solid in the iron
[1:31:54] which is the roman kingdom
[1:31:58] amen so i call into god's word
[1:32:02] when he talks about the word talks about
[1:32:05] superpower
[1:32:06] is the roman's kingdom
[1:32:09] amen the romans kingdom is
[1:32:13] the the the final last superpower
[1:32:19] are we together amen daniel chapter 7
[1:32:23] let's just look at something here
[1:32:30] daniel chapter 7 are we together
[1:32:42] glory be to god
[1:32:50] this smoke disaster
[1:32:55] verse one in the first year
[1:32:58] of belchers the king of babylon dania
[1:33:02] had a dream
[1:33:03] and a vision of his head upon his bed
[1:33:09] then he wrote the dream and told the
[1:33:12] psalm
[1:33:13] of the matter daniel speaking said i saw
[1:33:18] in my vision by night and behold
[1:33:24] the four winds of the heaven straw upon
[1:33:27] the
[1:33:28] great sea and four great beasts
[1:33:32] came up from the sea
[1:33:37] divers one from another the first
[1:33:40] was like a lion
[1:33:44] and high eagle wings he had now
[1:33:48] let me see this before we continue to
[1:33:50] read what
[1:33:51] nebuchadnezzar saw was
[1:33:55] the it was the political
[1:33:58] powers of the gentile kingdom
[1:34:03] amen it was the political power
[1:34:07] now what god is revealing to daniel
[1:34:11] is the religious power
[1:34:15] praise the lord and then when you bring
[1:34:18] this
[1:34:18] religious power and political power
[1:34:21] together
[1:34:22] they become threefold religious
[1:34:25] political and demonic
[1:34:30] are we together all right amen
[1:34:35] so we see here this this first bc
[1:34:38] a lion uh uh uh and and with eagle wings
[1:34:42] and i beheld till the wings thereof was
[1:34:45] plucked off
[1:34:46] is that is that kingdom losing losing
[1:34:48] his power
[1:34:49] and and and it was it was lifted up
[1:34:52] from the earth and
[1:34:55] and miss stan
[1:34:58] may stand upon the feet as a man
[1:35:01] and a man heart was giving
[1:35:05] to abe and behold another beast
[1:35:08] the second was a day amen
[1:35:12] the bed which we shall which represent
[1:35:15] the
[1:35:15] the persian kingdom and
[1:35:19] uh the bed and it was
[1:35:22] and uh and it rise up
[1:35:26] itself on one side
[1:35:30] and it had three ribs in the mouth
[1:35:36] of it between the teeth of it and and
[1:35:39] the said
[1:35:40] dust onto it arise the evolved
[1:35:43] much flesh after this
[1:35:49] i beheld in law another like a leper
[1:35:53] that was alexander the great history
[1:35:55] tells how he conquered
[1:35:58] his conquering was as the spee of a
[1:36:01] leper
[1:36:06] but that's that's not oh i'm i'm not i'm
[1:36:08] not into the history of
[1:36:09] i'm just trying to to uh
[1:36:14] behead a leper like a leper which had
[1:36:18] upon the back of it four wings
[1:36:23] of a foul and the beast had also
[1:36:26] forehead and dominion was given to it
[1:36:30] after this i saw in the night
[1:36:34] vision and beheld a fourth beast
[1:36:36] dreadful
[1:36:37] terrible strong exceeding
[1:36:40] and a high grade iron teeth
[1:36:43] it devolved and break and as you go
[1:36:47] through this you realize these four
[1:36:50] beasts really never had a proper
[1:36:53] description
[1:36:57] like the rest of the other beasts
[1:37:00] the first one had a description the
[1:37:03] second one
[1:37:04] like a bed first one a lion with wings
[1:37:07] second one like a bed a tear one like a
[1:37:09] leper
[1:37:10] but when you come to this fourth beast
[1:37:15] it really never had a description it was
[1:37:16] like a mis it was like a mysterious
[1:37:21] a mysterious creature
[1:37:25] revelation chapter 13 let's set up here
[1:37:27] we can go through this
[1:37:29] and i can we can travel down the history
[1:37:32] of eight
[1:37:32] but let's let's let's travel here in a
[1:37:35] little bit look at revelation
[1:37:36] chapter 13
[1:37:42] praise the lord
[1:37:46] am i making you sleepy
[1:37:51] you cannot sleep in a smoke disaster
[1:37:54] for you to sleep in a smoke disaster
[1:37:56] means you are dead
[1:37:59] you cannot sleep even someone in deep
[1:38:02] sleep
[1:38:04] when when there is smoke in the house
[1:38:07] the first thing you start coughing
[1:38:13] that's the thing that will wake you up
[1:38:16] from that stream then you realize
[1:38:23] you realize that the smoke is all over
[1:38:25] the place
[1:38:28] you can't sleep in this smoke disaster
[1:38:30] people
[1:38:32] it's serious
[1:38:40] revelation chapter 13. let's let's look
[1:38:43] at this
[1:38:56] let's read from verse one
[1:39:00] and i beheld upon the sand
[1:39:03] of the sea and saw a beast
[1:39:07] rise up out of the sea having seven
[1:39:10] heads in ten homes
[1:39:12] and upon his home's ten crowns
[1:39:16] and upon his head the name
[1:39:20] of blasphemy amen
[1:39:27] i was i was listening to that message
[1:39:29] blasphemous name
[1:39:30] this weekend and and it kind of led to
[1:39:34] all this but
[1:39:34] let's just trust the lord listen here
[1:39:37] now verse two
[1:39:38] and the beast which i saw
[1:39:42] was like a leper
[1:39:47] and his feet were as
[1:39:50] the feet of a bed your vision now
[1:39:57] down your vision now when daniel saw it
[1:40:01] they were separate when john is seeing
[1:40:04] it
[1:40:04] they are combined
[1:40:11] are we together
[1:40:14] praise the lord oh my goodness man
[1:40:23] look people this this message
[1:40:27] is the voice of god god
[1:40:30] sent us a prophet to be able to
[1:40:34] to show us these things
[1:40:39] amen to be able to show us these things
[1:40:42] that we will not be affected in the days
[1:40:44] that we are living
[1:40:46] these things are revered to us talk to
[1:40:49] us by the prophet i realized to you from
[1:40:51] verb branham
[1:40:52] they are revealed to us
[1:40:56] for us to prepare for this hour that's
[1:40:58] what brother brown said a church is
[1:41:00] rising up
[1:41:02] a people that would get desperate with
[1:41:04] god in prayer
[1:41:09] amen
[1:41:13] there it says i i mean they're they're
[1:41:15] talking about a boxing without we don't
[1:41:17] know when it will be out but
[1:41:18] you know god has already come and by the
[1:41:21] baptising of the holy god he has already
[1:41:23] fascinated his people
[1:41:26] that is the inoculation that the church
[1:41:28] needs that's the baptism
[1:41:30] of the holy ghost the thing that will
[1:41:32] make people
[1:41:33] to sob and cry and say oh god
[1:41:37] save this word save my brother save my
[1:41:40] sister lord god help me
[1:41:43] that's what we are talking about
[1:41:48] amen
[1:41:54] so john go here he says the beast which
[1:41:57] i saw was like a leper
[1:42:02] and the feet were like a bear
[1:42:05] whereas the feet of a bed and
[1:42:08] his mouth as the mouth of a lion
[1:42:13] and the dragon gave him
[1:42:16] his power and his seat
[1:42:21] and great authority
[1:42:25] so when daniel saw this vision it looks
[1:42:28] like they were they were they were
[1:42:30] they were individual beasts one like a
[1:42:33] lion with eagle wings
[1:42:35] and another one like a bed standing by
[1:42:38] itself
[1:42:39] and another one like uh like like a
[1:42:41] leper standing by himself
[1:42:43] but then when it came to the fourth
[1:42:46] beast
[1:42:47] it was mysterious
[1:42:51] you mean he just told us that it's a
[1:42:54] terrible beast it's strong
[1:42:55] it's dangerous
[1:43:02] glory to god
[1:43:05] we have to realize people very brave
[1:43:08] taught us in the seals
[1:43:10] that beast means the power
[1:43:15] amen that beast means a power
[1:43:22] these are the powers that we are dealing
[1:43:24] with
[1:43:26] praise the lord amen
[1:43:29] let me tell you the government does not
[1:43:31] have control over what is happening
[1:43:34] they don't have control over they try to
[1:43:36] play politics with aid but
[1:43:38] they don't have control over everybody
[1:43:39] trying to defend their camp
[1:43:45] because it's a smoke
[1:43:50] that's coming upon the world we are in a
[1:43:53] smoke disaster
[1:43:55] the entire world you know what
[1:43:57] revelation says that a smoke come out of
[1:43:59] the grave furnace it
[1:44:01] affected the air
[1:44:06] it affected the air
[1:44:10] the whole world
[1:44:15] it sees the word economy sees the word
[1:44:18] travel
[1:44:26] humble are the great nations
[1:44:32] german with all their medical experts
[1:44:34] and everything i mean a humble the whole
[1:44:36] world sees
[1:44:37] everybody
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:42] everybody has to be quarantined
[1:44:49] everybody wearing the max you know
[1:44:50] sometimes god will just allow some
[1:44:52] things just to be able
[1:44:54] to magnify what he's doing
[1:45:04] it might pass the eyes of the world but
[1:45:06] it does not pass the eyes of the elect
[1:45:10] because we are looking to prophecy
[1:45:13] that's the thing that excites us
[1:45:16] it's not a news on the media it's not
[1:45:18] seeing it
[1:45:19] because cnn does not even know what we
[1:45:21] are talking about
[1:45:25] and as as human as him in this human
[1:45:28] nature
[1:45:30] we cannot help but to be passionate
[1:45:34] you can't help but to be passionate you
[1:45:36] listen to something you choose yourself
[1:45:38] quickly
[1:45:39] that's human nature depending on what is
[1:45:41] your thoughts
[1:45:43] about what you are listening to you
[1:45:45] choose your side
[1:45:48] they don't have news to give us
[1:45:52] because these things have already been
[1:45:54] broadcasted by malachi 4.
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:45:57] it's already been broadcasted
[1:46:01] amen if you are listening to the message
[1:46:03] you are feeling on the message
[1:46:05] you have the news for the hour you have
[1:46:07] the news
[1:46:08] for the dead that's why he said
[1:46:10] recognizing your
[1:46:12] day and his message
[1:46:19] we don't get our news from cnn or fox
[1:46:24] news
[1:46:31] what are we talking about here
[1:46:34] we're talking about this smoke disaster
[1:46:37] that is blasting the world
[1:46:40] oh mine praise the lord are we together
[1:46:45] amen brother branham said fourth seal
[1:46:49] in the fourth seal he says now he said
[1:46:52] notice the antichrist
[1:46:55] was on the pill house makes
[1:46:59] color now you have to watch that now
[1:47:02] you have to watch that when brother
[1:47:04] branham say miss color
[1:47:06] which mean is the color of the first
[1:47:08] house rather
[1:47:10] the white the color of the second house
[1:47:12] rather
[1:47:14] the red the color of the tear house
[1:47:16] rather
[1:47:17] black they mixed together and it
[1:47:20] produced
[1:47:22] a pill house now
[1:47:25] revelation chapter 13 verse 2 is a
[1:47:28] mixing
[1:47:30] of powers
[1:47:33] the the lion with eagle wings the bed
[1:47:36] and the leper has been mixed
[1:47:41] we don't know the power that we are
[1:47:42] dealing with
[1:47:44] but better than talking on greater
[1:47:46] battle ever thought you don't know the
[1:47:48] power that you are dealing with
[1:47:50] people
[1:47:57] let's hide ourselves hey hannah don't
[1:47:59] write on that bible don't do that
[1:48:01] let's hide ourself behind the world
[1:48:06] because i'm saying you are no match to
[1:48:08] the combination of this power
[1:48:11] that you are reading about here the only
[1:48:14] saving secret place and hiding place
[1:48:16] is in the world
[1:48:20] you have no match you have no idea
[1:48:25] you have no idea because when brother
[1:48:29] branham talks about the
[1:48:30] the boycott that would come this is the
[1:48:34] way
[1:48:35] we we as believers in god's word
[1:48:39] we are the the people that will be that
[1:48:42] will be affected
[1:48:43] you know brethren talk about them
[1:48:45] turning our churches into storehouses
[1:48:54] praise the lord even now with that with
[1:48:57] the time that we are living in
[1:48:59] with the time that we are living in and
[1:49:00] all the tests that is growing up
[1:49:02] and and we're getting into a cold season
[1:49:04] and all of this
[1:49:09] flu vaccine is going to be mandatory
[1:49:15] it's going to be mandatory as a health
[1:49:19] worker you'll be forced to take your
[1:49:20] flu vaccine
[1:49:30] these powers are cooking
[1:49:34] they are they are they are emerging
[1:49:36] they've been emerging for a long time
[1:49:40] amen they've been emerging at the back
[1:49:42] of the scene
[1:49:43] they are now stepping into plainview
[1:49:51] he says the antichrist was on the pill
[1:49:53] house mixed color
[1:49:55] the house a house is a is is a beast
[1:50:00] that represents its power
[1:50:03] his power is all mixed up
[1:50:07] with what religion
[1:50:11] this is national power religious power
[1:50:14] is demonic power is all kinds of
[1:50:17] power all kinds of power
[1:50:22] all kinds of power
[1:50:31] no human smartness can beat this thing
[1:50:33] that we're talking about
[1:50:36] because if human smartness can beat it
[1:50:38] we will not be to where we are today
[1:50:43] amen we will not be to where we are with
[1:50:46] all the hundreds of life that we have
[1:50:50] lost
[1:50:55] just like in egypt all of those
[1:50:57] magicians sat there
[1:50:59] and they could do nothing when moses was
[1:51:01] bringing the plague
[1:51:03] they could do nothing
[1:51:08] when he stood right there in in in
[1:51:10] pharaoh palace
[1:51:11] he threw his stick down they threw
[1:51:13] theirs down
[1:51:14] of pharaoh said well you know just just
[1:51:17] come and trick my boys know what to do
[1:51:18] then
[1:51:20] amen but when moses starts saying
[1:51:23] darkness upon the land fleas
[1:51:24] frogs they went and said pharaoh better
[1:51:27] let that man go
[1:51:29] because we don't know how to deal with
[1:51:31] these things we don't have creative
[1:51:33] power
[1:51:34] creative power is in one group it's as
[1:51:37] children of god
[1:51:38] the church of the living god and that is
[1:51:41] the power
[1:51:42] that god has besought upon his church
[1:51:45] creative power
[1:51:47] is able to raise you out of your sickbed
[1:51:51] able to kick out every devil out of our
[1:51:53] lives
[1:51:55] that's what we're talking about creative
[1:51:57] power the power of almighty god himself
[1:52:03] we got to get serious with this thing
[1:52:04] people
[1:52:06] it's serious business
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:13] praise the lord young people
[1:52:16] don't take your future from god's hand
[1:52:18] you better leave it there it's more
[1:52:19] savor in god's hand
[1:52:21] than for you to take it from god's hand
[1:52:23] and try to run it yourself
[1:52:25] your future is more safer in god's hands
[1:52:28] you just follow him
[1:52:31] and get this baptising of the holy ghost
[1:52:33] that we're talking about
[1:52:35] amen he says he says all kinds of power
[1:52:38] mixed together it's a mixed pill house
[1:52:43] he says he got all kinds of power
[1:52:46] but when jesus come
[1:52:49] it's on a one solid
[1:52:53] red colored
[1:52:57] hearse he says the word the bleeding
[1:52:59] word
[1:53:05] so we depending only on one power

[1:56:25] is becoming flesh
[1:56:26] let me say it that way amen
[1:56:29] it's becoming flesh because he's telling
[1:56:31] the scripture there are a lot of crowns
[1:56:33] you know we
[1:56:34] we talk about the crown of life you know
[1:56:36] paul says the crown of life awaits you
[1:56:39] you know i mean god is not he's not
[1:56:41] going to put
[1:56:42] you know uh some kind of a sticking
[1:56:44] thing over our head no

[1:56:50] it's when he gave us his own life
[1:56:55] he crimes us with life we'll talk about
[1:56:57] crown but not not today
[1:56:59] so let's look but this the three power
[1:57:01] is crowning in one
[1:57:03] crowning in one wish me it has hit its
[1:57:05] peak
[1:57:08] it's becoming flesh and stepping out
[1:57:13] amen when brother branham preached when
[1:57:16] brother brandon preached
[1:57:17] the feasts of the trumpets
[1:57:20] where he talks about those two million
[1:57:22] demons you know what he said he says the
[1:57:25] pentecostal power
[1:57:26] the pentecostal blessing this holy ghost
[1:57:30] that the church had just reduced to
[1:57:33] speaking in tongues
[1:57:34] they had just reduced it to a church
[1:57:35] membership i mean the messenger we have
[1:57:37] the holy ghost
[1:57:38] he says he said that was the power it
[1:57:41] was
[1:57:42] the holy ghost that held those demons
[1:57:44] bound
[1:57:48] when the holy spirit was released it
[1:57:52] held those
[1:57:53] demon powers bound
[1:57:56] but as the church started playing on the
[1:57:59] experience of the holy ghost
[1:58:01] the lead was slowly taken out of here
[1:58:07] as the church start playing on the
[1:58:10] experience of the holy ghost
[1:58:11] you think about it when you give your
[1:58:13] life to the lord and you believe the
[1:58:15] word you believe the message
[1:58:16] how on fire you were for the lord and i
[1:58:19] mean there was just no time to
[1:58:20] compromise
[1:58:21] and i mean you were just on the firing
[1:58:23] line but as soon as
[1:58:25] you think that you started understanding
[1:58:27] better
[1:58:28] and you started taking different
[1:58:30] approaches you realize
[1:58:31] your life started being exposed to
[1:58:33] things that you never knew
[1:58:37] because the holy ghost will always keep
[1:58:40] the enemy bound praise the lord
[1:58:44] but when the people start playing on the
[1:58:46] experience of the holy ghost
[1:58:48] they tried to take it as a church
[1:58:50] membership and they tried to take it as
[1:58:52] this or that
[1:58:54] the prophet of god came and said now the
[1:58:57] lead is taken out of hell
[1:58:59] he said demon's powers are streaming out
[1:59:02] everywhere everywhere
[1:59:16] be to god amen
[1:59:21] amen he said three colors represented in
[1:59:24] one
[1:59:25] three powers represented in one the
[1:59:27] white house the black house the red
[1:59:28] house
[1:59:29] and the three crown in one three powers
[1:59:32] united together
[1:59:34] c all mixed up in color pill
[1:59:38] death death spoke
[1:59:41] in the whole thing
[1:59:45] is political and religious
[1:59:48] and demon power makes together
[1:59:54] praise the lord is political
[1:59:58] religion and demon power mixed together
[2:00:02] you think about this
[2:00:05] we love our doctors we pray for them
[2:00:07] they are the one on the on the firing
[2:00:08] line
[2:00:10] amen i mean good hot doctors
[2:00:14] sometimes you go to a doctor you talk to
[2:00:16] them and they look at your pills
[2:00:18] they know they see they see what you are
[2:00:20] dealing with
[2:00:22] and look at your prescriptions no this
[2:00:25] will not help you
[2:00:26] no no the side effect of this
[2:00:30] is going to make your situation worse
[2:00:33] why because
[2:00:34] the pharmaceutical company
[2:00:37] the pharmaceutical company praise the
[2:00:41] lord
[2:00:42] you look at that word pharmaceutical in
[2:00:44] the greek

[2:01:31] just i'm trying to
[2:01:32] i'm trying to bring us to this place so

[2:01:46] there are forces that is behind this
[2:01:53] that the forces that we are dealing with
[2:01:56] they are not small

[2:03:32] the young mind for the battle of america
[2:03:36] is preparing your mind for a blast

[2:17:26] he was setting is the setting thing
[2:17:31] that god wants to bring into our heart
[2:17:34] brother branham says the reason why
[2:17:36] god led him to preach that message on
[2:17:39] joshua parallel ephesian perilous joshua
[2:17:43] which is the adoption series
[2:17:44] he said is to take the fear
[2:17:48] of being lost
[2:17:52] the fear of being lost that's the thing
[2:17:53] that pledged the church
[2:17:58] as now we get into a little little
[2:18:00] condition we are so afraid in our mind
[2:18:02] we oh i'll be lost what's about the god
[2:18:05] that have kept you out of these years
[2:18:10] amen is this experience not real to you
[2:18:17] you have to know that the god of the
[2:18:19] mountain is the same one in the valley

[2:18:26] things are not happening don't trash
[2:18:28] your experience

[2:18:33] yourself the worst sinner in the world
[2:18:35] what are you doing to the blood of jesus
[2:18:37] that have kept you out of his ears
[2:18:43] god is raising up a people that when the
[2:18:46] devil gives you a slap
[2:18:48] you turn around and give him a kick in
[2:18:50] his face
[2:18:53] when he thinks you are turning around to
[2:18:54] go back to the world you are just
[2:18:56] turning around to know how to send your
[2:18:58] leg straight to his mouth
[2:19:07] that's the kind of a church that god
[2:19:09] that's that's the people that are going
[2:19:11] in the rapture
[2:19:12] now the people that are they are so
[2:19:14] afraid and thinking i don't know if i
[2:19:16] would make it
[2:19:17] god already said you will make it he was
[2:19:20] not depending on your strength
[2:19:22] he was not depending on your
[2:19:23] intelligence he was depending on the
[2:19:25] power of his word
[2:19:32] he already said he you will make it
[2:19:34] right amen
[2:19:36] he already said it glory be to god
[2:19:41] why can't you believe god then believe
[2:19:43] your weaknesses
[2:19:45] what can you believe god's word and
[2:19:47] believe those evil thoughts that are
[2:19:48] coming to your mind
[2:19:50] why can't you take god at his word
[2:19:52] praise the lord
[2:19:55] amen let the devil blast your mind even
[2:19:58] in church let he blast your mind
[2:20:00] and he keeps blessing your mind say
[2:20:01] hallelujah jesus thank you for your word
[2:20:03] jesus
[2:20:08] the more he bless your mind the more you
[2:20:10] stream and shout and praise

[2:20:20] he's raising up a people
[2:20:26] glory be to god amen
[2:20:30] he's raising up a people
[2:20:33] and the reason why he's allowing us
[2:20:37] to go through all of these things
[2:20:40] we have to bring out
[2:20:43] that character
[2:20:46] god is going to take from this bride a
[2:20:48] capstone character
[2:20:53] remember when he make man in genesis
[2:20:56] chapter 1
[2:20:57] he make man male and female
[2:21:01] in his image amen
[2:21:07] he already got a man christ jesus
[2:21:11] now he's bringing out that female
[2:21:16] praise the lord he's bringing out that
[2:21:18] female
[2:21:20] a church that will be co-equal with
[2:21:24] christ

[2:21:29] is not the millennial you will be called
[2:21:31] equal you'll be called equal right here
[2:21:34] by the power of the word a church that
[2:21:36] would be core equal
[2:21:40] that's why he waved before us a wave
[2:21:43] shift
[2:21:44] brother branham could speak things into
[2:21:46] existence
[2:21:48] why is a bride that is co-equal
[2:21:55] so he's bringing up a church that would
[2:21:56] be core equal
[2:22:01] you better start speaking if you want
[2:22:04] things to happen you better start
[2:22:06] speaking amen
[2:22:08] you better start speaking praise the
[2:22:11] lord
[2:22:15] if it does not make sense to you don't

[2:23:25] unimportantly speaking
[2:23:28] the miraculous is happening

[2:23:38] gentile powers

[2:23:59] you want to tie it in
[2:24:02] unite with the word
[2:24:12] brother branham told us
[2:24:15] just as simple a christian reads their
[2:24:18] bible and pray every day
[2:24:22] you know it's it's a simple quote and it
[2:24:24] can just be as simple as picking up your
[2:24:26] bible
[2:24:27] and reading and saying lord jesus thank
[2:24:29] you for today father lord just be with
[2:24:31] us

[2:24:40] to read you know that you are coming in
[2:24:43] contact
[2:24:44] with the lord jesus
[2:24:48] it has to be more real to you

[2:24:54] scriptural union
[2:24:55] movement to just read your bible and
[2:24:58] memorize scripture
