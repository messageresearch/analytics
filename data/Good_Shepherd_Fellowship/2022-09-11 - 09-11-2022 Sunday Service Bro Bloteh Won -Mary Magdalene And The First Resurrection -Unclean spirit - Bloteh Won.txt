Ghost comes in the meeting is just a cup dressing a coffin amen praise the Lord but when the holy ghost shows up then we will have church amen praise the Lord Hallelujah amen amen musicians that will be all for the music I have a little more on my plate this morning so I want us to just go right into into the word let's go right into the word this morning praise the Lord I have a a kind of a strange title this morning remember for Wednesday night we were talking a little bit there on on uh uh we were talking there on on unclean spirit praise the Lord amen let me let me look at Luke 24 uh I'm just I'm kind of looking looking for a description of what what my inspiration will be okay Luke said it a different way looks at a different way I think Mark Harvey the way that my mind is looking at it now that's that's the resurrection morning that's the resurrection morning uh uh that's the resurrection morning scripture I'm looking at you'll find that in Matthew 28th and then you find it in mocking and all of the the the the gospels the apostles they have a they have a different way that uh that they introduce this subject they have a different way that they introduced this subject but one of them brought it out in a way that that caught my attention last night and made me to change my subject I want to speak on this morning I want to speak on Mary Magdalene and the first resurrection Mary Magdalene and the first resurrection praise the Lord now you have to realize that the first resurrection is a rapture amen when John talks about the Rapture in the Book of Revelation he calls that the first resurrection and uh and then Mary Magdalene was was one of the lady uh there was that was first at the throne amen one of the first one that Jesus spoke to so I was I was looking at uh on clean Spirit last night continuing my studies on it trying to find a way uh to be able to bring it out uh so let's let's use Mac let's use Mac chapter 16. let's use the way that Mike brought it out because the reason is that you will see it when we read it you will you will soon grab uh word I was I was struggling all through the night okay yeah Mark Mark chapter 16 verse 9 Mark chapter 16 verse 9. Mark chapter 16 verse 9. we'll read that one verse and then you have your seat and then we will start digging into the word amen praise the Lord I hope you brought your shovel and your Digger and everything because we're going to dig this morning this is going to be a digging service amen praise the Lord so if you don't want to get yourself message just leave us because everybody's going to get messy this morning amen you can dignify I mean keeping yourself clean praise the Lord verse 9 let's read um now when Jesus was Raising ailing the first day of the week he appeared first that is the inspiration he appeared first to married Magdalene out of home he had cast Seven Devils so Mary Magdalene after her Deliverance how her first resurrection let us pray Heavenly Father we will ask your blessings upon your word this morning and Lord I pray that God you will come in a special way and help us Lord as we look at this subject this morning Father Almighty God and your word is great your word is powerful we don't want to forget law to remember our sister Lord whose prayer request was mentioned over the pulpit and father we pray that God you will touch her Lord and father if there is any sick one in our midst this morning may you touch them too those that were not able to make the service law because of the illness of their body may you oh God touch them in their home but father Lord Beyond this the illness of our body there are places in our Our Lives Lord and and where we need a touch from you father Lord God and your hands is great Lord your hands is great father we just pray the Lord you will reach down and lift us up this morning we need you father we need you the most we as we commit ourselves in your hands now come and break your word and speak to us this morning in a way that only you can in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat let's go right into the word this morning let's go right into the word this morning and Mayor Michael Lane and the first resurrection some years back I preached this message in a different way than I entitled to a little Magdalene in the seventh Church age because I was typing the seven uh Devils that was cast out of her to represent the seventh Church age but I'm going to we're going to approach it in a different way this morning dealing with unclean spirit and uh Wednesday night we read a quote from the message their house I want to go right into that this morning brother Brandon says concerning the three unclean spirit that come out of Revelation come out of the mouth of the false prophet and the dragon uh and the Beast now if you go to Revelation there there there are three that were named the false prophet the dragon and the Beast out of that came the the three unclean spirit so uh uh the the false prophet the Beast and the dragon are the uh the the influence behind this unclean spirit that is that came out like frogs the false prophet the dragon and the Beast praise the Lord amen you have to realize that Beast is a power every time it's used in The Book of Revelation it's a power and uh the false prophet is the mouth through which their Spirit come out the dragon is the system foreign so the system has the power and it has a man that he uses there is no spirit that is powerful unless you have a body Spirits are just rumbling until a culture a body it can never manifest its power are we together now so uh uh here we see the as as we approach this and uh brother Stephen wolves can you please come help me yeah praise the Lord so as we see this you will you will realize uh bring look in that big boss bring my glasses for me please the three unclean spirit Brahm says here is the three isms and we look at that on Wednesday night let me type it for you now and you will and you will see where it starts where it begins there was communism uh Fascism and Nazism he says in in uh they were spirits communism is a spirit it gets on you C is a spirit it will be something like that and then he goes on and and and make us to realize that it comes out of the the it comes out of catalism now so if we look over in uh uh Deuteronomy seven let's go to Deuteronomy seven quickly I told you that you got to get your hand to the soil this morning amen we will dig in a little bit let's look at verse one there there are many places when you read about the Nations that uh uh Israel was going to to possess or overcome or draft out the word the right word is to drive out remember we said on Wednesday night uh uh uh evil spirit uh uh you can be healed from a sickness let me say it this way because I will read the scripture in the Bible so you will rightly understand it you can be healed from it from from a sickness but what happened is that the the the holy ghost or the law cast out their spirit amen because when when when this when the spirit possess your body a affects your body it makes you sick so the Lord have to cast out that spirit and heal your body praise the Lord that's the reason why you can get sick and feel and get healed and get sick again because the spirit is cast out are you understanding me praise the Lord so so so evil spirit uh uh uh uh can can be cast out that's what I want to that's that's the thought I want you to hold in your mind that evil spirit can be cast out and that's the reason why just like I said from the womb to the Grave our greatest battle is to keep the spirit out is to keep it away from us praise the Lord because no matter how you are deep in the holy ghost from your hair to your told you can still be influenced by evil spirit are we together praise the Lord amen I hope you came pray of this morning because we we're going to stir the waters amen praise the Lord we're going to stir the waters don't don't sleep under me this morning you might get yourself in a in a kind of uh a bad bad shape praise the Lord okay yeah we'll manage we'll become a one-hour preacher amen praise the Lord now so if you look here in Deuteronomy chapter 7 you will see when the Lord when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whether thy goeth to possess it there and have cast out many nations before thee and have cast out I want you to see that word cast out they were to drive them out amen and then and if even Moses told them don't drop them out at once possess the land little by little because if you drive them out at once the White Beast would come and consume you now what I want you to watch here is that the Nations that were going to be uh uh uh cast out there were seven right here that we need there were Seven Nations that were named now Jesus Matthew chapter 12 when he talks to Israel we will get there because Matthew chapter 12 is a very important John John scripture when he was talking to to the people uh uh after after they call him he is casting that evil spirit by vegetable he told them that uh when an evil spirit goes out amen when that evil spirit is cast out of a man it goes and room about and goes and finds what seven are the spirit praise the Lord amen the way you would think about it is that it's one it go find seven other Spirit that's the way the human mind will think about it no is just the same old Spirit increasing seven times getting stronger because because Jesus said it makes the man worse than his first state are we together it makes the man worse than his first state now so brother Brandon is is telling us that the the three uh unclean spirit he put them on the politics he put them on a National Power out of all of these uh uh communism in fact they were all forms of government that rule the word and he says there will all be swallow up in communism praise the Lord which of course is is the great influence upon the uh uh uh uh the politics of the world today that's the reason why Democratic is now working why because the influence behind every war in the country every disorder in the election is a communist spirit that is Warren against democracy why because the other two has been swallowed up by communism now so this is the way I want you to see it just like there were Seven Nations that were stopping Israel from getting to her promised man there are seven Church a spirit that is stopping the bride from getting to her inheritance because uh uh uh uh how can we overcome brother Branham says every age gets the the the benefit the the blessings or the curse from the age in succession so everything that was in episode H passed down to the next age and everything from all the first second third fourth fifth Church a sixth Church age have come down to this loudly should age that's the reason why this age is the greatest evil age in the world we have more churches and the church is in her worst state than they have ever been we have great Revelation there have never been a time in history where the Bible has been on it has been so much on this plane we have it on our iPhone we have it on the iPad we're projected on the war yes we read the Bible less than nnh it's not because you don't want to read the Bible it's because there is an influence there is a power there is a spirit praise the Lord there's a power there is a spirit there is an influence that is down in this Edge praise the Lord so you see it first started as a political power I will help you to understand it also when God gave down there the the King nebuchadne has a good dream amen now watch now when God was about to deal with the Jews he gave Pharaoh a dream amen and Joseph gift interpreted the dream to bring the Jews into Egypt amen for them to wait for their deliverer because God told Abraham that after 400 years after four generation that's why he said over in Genesis chapter 15. Genesis chapter 15. praise the Lord read it with me nor write it down in whichever way you want to get your hand message just to make your choice praise the Lord Genesis chapter 15 uh let's let's see the Promise dear Genesis chapter 15. verse 13 and he said to Abraham surely nor of surety that the sea shall be a stranger in a land that that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflect them 400 years and also that Nation whom they shall serve our George and After All Shall they come out with great substance and thou shall go to thy father in peace that's talking to Abraham now thou shall be buried in a good age but in the fourth generation Isaac Jacob Levi and Levi give birth to Moses the fourth generation 4 is the number of Deliverance but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is now full yet now so God gave Abraham This Promise but before the Fulfillment of this promise this is the way that God will deal with the Jews God gave Abraham a promise through whom he become the father of many nations but the Jewish race have not started yet God had not brought a group of people on a covenant praise the Lord now for God to do there what will he do he will give Pharaoh a dream and he will raise up a boy with a gift Joseph that were interpret the dream and that interpretation of the dream seven year of family seven year of surplus it was all to bring Jacob and his sons into the promised land for this promise to be fulfilled amen God that watch over his word to make sure that the promise is fulfilled he allowed the boys out of jealousy to to say Joseph out and Joseph went there he preserved Joseph in the house of of of of Spotify praise the Lord when it was so easy for him to fall on a lost he could have all of the benefits because what if I give him everything he have power over everything in the house beside the woman praise the Lord Hallelujah you know very well that I mean if you love the woman you have the house amen I mean it's a simple that's what our fathers taught us love your wife you have the house now so God allowed all of that to happen all of that was just the mechanism engineering to bring Genesis 15 promise to pass because that would take 400 years that would bring them to four generation now God dealing with the Gentiles he would do the same he will give Nebuchadnezzar a dream and he would give a boy called Daniel the interpretation of the dream to show the way that he will deal with the Gentile Nations praise the Lord amen so if you talk about superpower you can you can you can you can follow the media you can follow everything but in God's mind God's superpower is the is the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar dream that starts from the head of God which was the Babylonian Kingdom and and in the feet of iron and Clay which is the Roman Kingdom that is established by the Roman Catholic Church so in God's mind the superpower when you talk about superpower not Russia not America is the Vatican are we together because God always designed a mechanism the mechanics have to be in place for the Dynamics to strike everything has to be in place are we together the reason why we have a lot of violence and we have a lot of immorality is because the mechanism for these things are already in place right there's no man that can rise on the same prophesy Revival for America it will never happen praise the Lord because you don't have the mechanism to bring Revival you don't have the mechanism to bring Revival for the nation now so so that's that's the that's the description that's the reason why you can type the the three unclean spirit with these political influence because it has to start from political powers the in in the Gentile Kingdom it started with political power Babylon as the head of God but then when it got in the feet it broke into a pagan room and papa room in the feet a form a religious power so it moves slowly from a political power to a religious power because politics only govern our flesh amen but religious power govern your spirit that's right praise the Lord amen politics only govern our flesh so we will realize that that these unclean spirits be some clean spirit they they are more than just the things that we battle with in our mind and and and the habits and and all the things that we don't like about ourself praise the Lord they have an influence every one of us our first birth we were born in uncleanness that's true that came from The Serpent and Eve the only representation that you have of God was in your soul but your spirit and your body was born insane shapeless in iniquity that's the reason why we must be born again it's a must it's not whether you choose it or not praise the Lord are we together so Mary bam goes go ahead here then he he talks about how communism is a spirit and he says that's that's what it gets on people he says uh uh it would be something like that on it he says that's really uh uh uh he says but it's it's it will be free Spirits just like that he says watch that uh was kind of a forerunner is is uh it's in catalism so it's it's it it ran like that from political power and they end up as a religious system catalism she's behind every wall she's behind every government she speaks and those leaders obey praise the Lord if you were Now obey they'll get you out are we together she has her Embassy in every nation as a small Catholic church with a bill that Reigns should become kind to the people and give them hospitals and give them schools all she's trying to do is to brainwash him brainwashed him she has a very slick way of bringing you to worship her idols praise the Lord she don't send evangelists you never find somebody coming out to evangelize she don't say evangelists all she has to do she build a very nice Church she goes the way she evangelize is by charity that's right that's how she evangelized that how she wins Souls is by charity and the modern church has followed the same let's do barbecue let's get bunch of bread so we can win souls it was never like that in the book of Arts amen amen Jesus tried one time and he told them you just follow me because of the bread you eat the church don't win church I mean win souls by charity the Bible said you can even give your body to be burned now so uh so as we look at this as we travel alone here I want you to see that I want you to understand there because uh uh I mean whatever you are dealing with is uh it has a root praise the Lord amen it has a root and if you can be able to deal with it rightly you can you can uh you see I I was just telling last night and and uh you know uh and and the Holy Spirit kind of struck me and to realize that and I said this over in in in Chicago after the wedding last uh last weekend I had a privilege to preach in a historical church there as I started I think somewhere back in the 1933 that was the first church on that street and so but what I was trying to to say to and encourage the people that is there because most of the time you know people they get caught up in this thing but look at this type now look at this type as you look at it through the through the the scripture there was a relationship between Adam and Eve the hard air relationship praise the Lord when he fell Adam could identify himself with Eve praise the Lord King and Abel they had religion when one was rejected and the other one was accepted the one that was rejected sought to kill the ones that was accepted praise the Lord so you see is it will always be religion religious spirit that will separate people amen if you have ever had a true relationship with God no matter what you believe it will never separate you from the people that you love it will even make you more humble it will make you more associative but if you get a religious spirit on you because you believe you should wear white shirts and the next man wear black shirt you walk out of this door that's what a religious spirit will do and people say I have a stand you're just standing on a religious demon a relationship with God will never do that praise the Lord amen you have a relationship with your parents that's not that I mean you're that that's how you were born it was out of relationship now how will now people come to believe a message or give their life to Christ and then it despise their parents how how does that happen you don't associate with your parents I mean your loved ones and and all of that and then you say because you you have a faith they don't believe what I believe you just got a religious devil on you even if your children has backslide they have left the message you bonded you must always love them [Music] your parent can be a worshiper of of the devil that's your father he was worshiping devil before he born you you must respect him because she believed the message you will get the Seven Seals thank you let me preach my message here praise the Lord there's some clean spirit is more than what we think it is praise the Lord because every man ways is right in their own eyes every man weighs is right in their own eyes but is the is the Lord that Josh had the spirit of man amen praise the lord we can justify the things we do praise the Lord amen and nobody is going to change me from what right I mean that's that's my choice and whatever I want you can I mean that's I mean that's I mean that's as far as you understand it but because you think it's right it's not right it's not because you think that it is right makes it right right for there is a way that see me right unto a man that's right that's why Solomon says here come on let's go ahead here I told you that we have a lot to dig into amen so as you look at this and uh you know when it was beautiful when brother Stephen brought it out there Wednesday night uh how one of the gospels says You must cast it out and another says You must overcome it that was just beautiful praise the Lord You Have you have to keep it on a suggestion you have to keep it on a suggestion amen amen if not you will be you will be you'll be ruled by that spirit now so he uh uh he goes he goes ahead and he he tells us here uh he says and uh uh I truly believe right now just to kind of outline it if I add a little more to it uh I'll add a little more to it when I get to explain it you don't explain it all together down down there that night he says if I do that here's what I think I believe it's a spirit he's talking about the same communism and he says the sleeping virgin now who are the sleeping virgin that's Matthew chapter 25. the the five that did not have all in their line but the beautiful thing here is that the Bible says they are sleeping virgin which means they have a clean life they are virgin they have not been touched by men but yeah we see that he's putting an influence behind him how he says I believe that the sleeping virgin Confederation of churches the World Council of churches that's what he means all of these are honored the influence of their unclean spirit Judaism on their rejection rejecting of Christ Judaism the people that the the Covenant of circumcision was given to they were all honored that was the spirit you think about it that make them to crucify they are very Messiah in the name of what religion They Crucified they are very Messiah in the name of religion we destroy our home destroy our family destroy our children praise the Lord we just get on the tank the message said we must not do that you can't do this the message say you are not having a relationship with a child you are not bringing the truth to them you are putting a religious spirit on them you must be able to communicate the truth by relating not commending praise the Lord I was studying the other day and I came across this beautiful phrase and I love it try to memorize it it can't stick in my head but they were just they're just two words there truth and Authority Authority is not truth but truth is Authority amen praise the lord it's not because you have the authority makes everything you say is truth no but the truth shall make you free you know the beautiful thing about preaching to people everybody can choose to understand it any way they Wonder yeah well I know what I said don't tell me the way you understand it is what I said that how you understand it amen don't say that why you said no that's not what I said that's a beautiful thing amen well you're not in church now what the pastor said did you listen your ear was not open just pushing what you understood now so as as we look at this I'm not even started yet so we find all of these things Judaism on the on the rejecting of Christ the Jews that rejected it catholism he says because you see where it comes out of a false prophet out of the mouth of the false prophet that's what the scripture says in Revelation the the the false prophet is the mouth is is the ministry is the messenger on the earth that is the mouth but behind their mouth there is a beast a power that will not make them to say anything truth how 40 men can can surround me carry the prophet and said this land belonged to us praise the Lord they can prove it they could prove it by the word because Raymond Gita Raymond Gita if you look go back in the Book of Joshua it was one of the City of Refuge so if those men tell you that we have the court you can believe them that they have the court they were quoting from the word I have the court it's not it's not having the court it's applying the court in the right season uh uh uh go go and look at the the city of The Refuge the sixth sitting The Refuge what a prophets have already said that dogs were like Ahab block really so when Mikhail was was was having this vision there was a word that says yeah remagina is it belongs to Israel but what did he say he said Israel is without a shepherd in my vision Israel is without a shepherd and Ahab was the shepherd but there was a prophecy from a Prophet Elijah that was Haunting him yeah so you can have all your code to back up whatever you want to back up the code don't intimidate us no it edify us bring the courts they don't intimidated us because we want to learn so bring up the courts praise the Lord now don't think don't create in your mind here don't make the devil to divert your thought I'm coming against spirit I'm not fighting any individual don't allow the devil to distract you praise the Lord I did not spend my night off fighting individual I'm fighting spirits I won't stay up until 3 A.M if I have a problem with an individual I go to your house I will sit down with you and tell you right in your face so don't think I'm I'm chasing anybody here no no no no if you were in church if you were not here I would preach this whether you are here or not I will preach this your presence don't change my inspiration [Music] because I wait on God for it so you are all welcome praise the Lord he loved the Lord amen now Broadband shared this in in question and answer mark of the beast it's beautiful beautiful very beautiful see what he says he says the Bible said free unclean Spirit went out of the mouth of the Beast he said do you know what unclean spirit say it like frost did you ever notice how the frogs look the frogs always Looking Backward he never looked forward looking back always back look back the four beats which is the four living creatures he says the heart the full different head the the the the the lion the ox the man and the eagle that's the full living creature he's talking about they were moving forward all the time now I've demonstrated that for you before but let's let's do it one more time and you you guys come up y'all come and help me preach let's do it amen come up come on buddy don't sit down there you got to be one of the living creatures take your hands from your pocket you are a living creatures you are not a bigger boy now so bound your hands like this hold your hands like this okay give your back your back okay but tie to your hands because we are protecting the truth no I'm one don't leave me out praise the Lord now so the living creatures are like this the throne is in the mess this is where the church is that's why Jesus said the case of Hell will never Prevail because the church is right here to get to the church you have to pass by one of these living creatures so the living creatures are like this one is the the head of a lion one is the head of an ox one is the the anointing of a man and the other one is the anointing of an ego now when they move praise the Lord are you okay are you ready because these living creatures are anointing so are you ready for the anointing to move okay Simon you move when Simon moved we all move here so what is happening that's what brother Branham says now listen now Aaron is now moving backwards he's moving forward because when Simon moved all three of us Unite and stand with that anointing so he's now moving backwards I'm now moving sideways we are all moving forward praise the Lord you get the picture God bless you Brothers [Applause] now uh you you you will see that's what makes it beautiful I love it I love it when I hear those sounds it tells me somebody is trying to digest I gave you a space to to to burp a little bit praise the Lord now so it's it's beautiful it's beautiful because these are the things that people don't understand people don't understand it the the those living creatures they are they are they are the ones they are that there that were seen as a cherubim that gathered the trait of life in the Garden of Eden they were those living creatures now and and they are the anointing that is on the church so when the church is under the Lions anointing all the powers of the living creature stand behind that and anoint the church so they move in that direction now when the church gets on of the ox anointing which is death persecution praise the Lord amen we we failed the the the the the the the ox and not in one year two that is that was part of this church that we lost left us now sometimes when those things happen people say so yeah you know people are dying in that church no the church is put under that anointing for that time sure that's the reason why now the entire church the the the the full living creature in that church WIll unite us to bear with one another so sometimes it looks like well there is there is there is forces and and all of that and all you are all of the ox anointing if you are under the anointing of the hour you will unite together sins together and fight that persecution you have a wrong understanding the same thing happened to you in your own body sometimes you are on fire for God it looks like you have the Holy Ghost and the demon come I can kick him right in the face and sometimes your head is stuck between your knees you are just crying it does not mean that God has rejected you you are just honor and anointing for the hour that's the reason why sometimes one day you have the Holy Ghost another day you don't have the Holy all those anointing have the Holy Ghost foreign bring Divine Healing under the honor the honor the four beats what is the ego the ego is an instant Miracle you are prayed for and you are healed that's the ego's anointing was the man's anointing you go to your doctor and your doctor tells you this is what is happening to you you take this medicine and take this medicine and take this medicine do this do this do this that's the next anointing if you believe God you will obey your doctor amen amen praise the Lord now sometimes is the ox anointing you find people that have prayed about things they have been prayed for verbaland have one in this church heavywise sister one instance she got it from the witch here and she sat right back down in that very same church brother will was preached was prayed for when he died and God raised him back up in that very same church people received their sight people with cancer was healed but she was there under the ox I know you are in your Affliction but you are still praising God you still find us trying to come to come to church praise the Lord because you know whether this sickness kill me or I'm Healed of it I have a brand new body that can step in any moment okay [Applause] now when you don't understand these things then you become a fanatic and you think that you are applying faith where am I now so you see that's the beautiful thing but the unclean Spirit don't move in that direction it tried to make you to think that you are moving forward but is trying to produce the Revival of the past when we when we were in Africa this is the way we used to do it it's a past Revival stop looking back deal with what you have to deal with right now put your home in order put your work a schedule in order find time to pray find time to Fast Five time to read the word don't be looking in Africa in Africa we used to do this we're Africa in Africa go back to Africa I know go back if you come to America the people they are so cold go back nobody call you here thank you now so you see as you as you look look at these things as you look at these things what is the time here okay now so let's let's get in our message a little bit here we want to talk about Mary Magdalene I was trying to build this now so like I said seven Seven Nations was stopping Israel from getting to their promise so seven spirits Through the Ages have been warring against the church from getting to her promise her promised word her promised message for the age her promised Deliverance now you will realize that in the in the in the scripture uh there is there's a form of sickness that that uh that represented unclean spirit that was leprosy the first time leprosy was mentioned was Exodus chapter four when married when Moses received his Commission praise the Lord the first sign was throwing the the the his stick down it turned into sipping and second represents sin the next sign was for him to put his hand in his bosom representing the inner part of the man the first son was the outer part what you see the second he had to put his hand when he takes us out it was leprous so Moses came under the commission of the do what are two men his message was to deliver them from sin and sickness that's the do order to me that's the reason why the turtle dove was never split into half because in a too many live in Leviticus it represented healing are we together so the Covenant was always adored a a dual Attunement sin and sickness that's why Jesus will say sir you are healed your sin is forgiving you because it's a daughter to me you can separate it you can separate it we cannot be free from the sin of the flesh unless we are healed in our spirit until God thee with unbelief in our spirit our body can never be free from telling lies and and and you know and thinking foolish now so that was the first time Moses commission was on a do other two men seen in sickness it was a message of total Deliverance as simple as his message was it is not the message that is preached it's the commission that backs the message right praise the Lord amen sorry I'm not here to make you excited today I'm not a good teacher but I'm trying my best to teach because we have to place these things right now the second time we'll realize that God set an order in Leviticus chapter 13 how leprosy have to be observed so when a person had a spot in their flesh that looks like leprous they have to be watched over seven days years okay the the priests they will lock you up after seven days you'll come and show yourself to the priest again and the priest will examine you so yes another seven again amen we're realizing in second Kings chapter five Nehemiah the Syrian uh uh Captain how to be watched in the Jordan River how many times seven times for what cleansing are we together you know these things you know the scripture so we just read into you Numbers Chapter 12 we realize also that Miriam Miriam and uh and uh and Aaron got to gossiping they go to gossiping and they got leprosy Miriam was struck with leprosy praise the Lord you ask me the question about why Aaron was not struck but it because it was both of them why Aaron was not strong I will read something to you from the word that will answer that your question now second chronicles I think brother Chacha that goes back to what we were talking Wednesday night you know he was asking the question you know Moses I mean David David seen it against the law by numbering the people but when God sent the plaque David never die it was the people that died why why did God did not struck David it was the people that died hundreds of people lost their life David said Lord I have done this is very sinful that's that's just very simple principle amen now David prayed and asked the Lord to deal with him and the Lord in dealing with him there with his people so how how simple uh uh simple there could be and yet it sounds a little bit complicated is because it's more hurtful to a man when God is dealing with your children then when God deals with you praise the Lord amen amen when God these were for leader it can be more secrecy than when God deals with the people praise the Lord amen you have to remember that David was uh David was a leader and and the reason of the plan was not to kill David even though people lost their life but it was a correction now you see that's the reason why we all the responsibility not to sit down and allow our leaders to lead us in the dump when things are not right speak out and say it is not right and let's fix it praise the Lord now if you read Numbers Chapter 12 it was Mary and the Bible says the Miriam came to Iran now Miriam was a big sister she was trying to express her opinion about about Moses wife you know but whether the conversation was mirrored and Aaron when the law starts to deed Aaron said he went crying to Moses he said we have done wrong he never left himself out of the matter he said we have done wrong praise the Lord amen but you you can also understand and realize that he has just been placed into the office of a priest right yeah which is the office of a leader you can think it in a very same sense that's the reason why their iniquities of the father does not visit the father but the children why would God these were the children because of the iniquities of their father now so that was another time that leprosy struck the church I mean the uh the church because of gossip and then we saw also spiritual leprosy struck the New Testament Church when ananias and so far choose to stay in their house and gossip praise the Lord amen you having young people you have young children when you are dealing with things take it to the Lord in prayer don't say things unconsciously and influence your children your negative expression could put a spirit of rebellion on your children and they will never be able to submit to the word because they do not see summation in you right right because the things that you are talking who is he for him to say that to me how can he say that to me and me and then you are just putting evil spirit on your children now we see used here second Chronicle chapter 26 you see or die from leprosy why because he stepped his bound he never had no right to hold the holy sensor of God he thought because he was King he was eloquent and sometimes you you go through those things I mean you're going through things and you're asking yourself why why you are going through it maybe you were in the wrong position you were in the wrong place now so in in the Old Testament uh leprosy has been used to to uh signify uncleanness and just like I said it had to be watched over uh seven days the person is kept and washed over seven days until uh the you come and show yourself back to the priests now so we see here uh leave the young baby therefore enjoy herself amen let her praise the Lord out of the mouths of babes amen when he's when he's getting when he's getting disturbing the parent will know what to do amen now so we see here we want to look at this woman this woman Mary Magdalene now there are there are stories in the gospel that run across the report of the Full Gospel and they come very close to describing the situation that is happening for the moment praise the Lord amen we uh uh grateful to have our sister I think their sister Rochelle sister-in-law she's serving in the military we want to thank thank God for her service amen uh we we always start to appreciate our military people amen so we we thank her for her service now so uh we we see here you if you look into this into the scripture Matthew chapter 26 you write it down you go and do your own reading Mark chapter 14 Luke chapter 7 answering John chapter 12. now if you read these passages you will realize there are similarities of things that took place the Bible some places the Bible call her a certain woman the Bible never make mention of the name of the woman that took the alabaster bus and anointed Jesus feet the scripture for some reason never make mention of that woman amen and uh uh but it is in John 12 it appears like it was married Lazarus sister praise the Lord amen now I'm I'm just I'm just putting scripture out there to you so you can go home and and and study but you will see here that I will pick up some few things from the prophet you appreciate it you will see here that uh there was something of this woman like there there's a scripture there that brought it out beautiful and as I was looking at it last night studying uh uh it's I mean it came out so beautiful I think that is Luke Luke chapter 8. Luke chapter 8 are we together amen Luke chapter 8. don't never take your frustration before your children those children are far smarter than you they are fast far smarter than you they they are blessed and now the uh now in Luke chapter 8 the Bible says and and certain woman which have been healed of evil spirit and infirmities Mary called Magdalene she was called Magdalene but her name was Mary so Magdalene was not her surname Magdalene was a description they have for her because of what she suffered oh mine praise the Lord praise the Lord now so with Luke with Dr Luke approached to the scripture he was able to give us an Insight because the other scripture the other gospel just this traveled as a setting woman right but Luke brought her as a certain woman and then tore us so you see that's the reason why my brother Brandon preached about the woman that weep at Jesus feet he talks about all the life that she live which of course it was a life that was open because even Simon knew the woman and said if Jesus was really a prophet he would know that this woman is an unclean woman are we together now I can I can go in today I'm not going to do uh nemology and in order there for you this morning but I can go into into that and and and help you to appreciate the other uh uh uh the the Mary had had uh something that she suffered from and then in all of that was the cause of the the life that she she got herself into praise the Lord and you go back into history and then you read a little bit you realize that uh it was it was almost something like like like an epilepsy because she was always falling and that's what the name Magdalene means one that is thrown out one that falls now that's just history now that's just history so um that's just history leaving us there praise the Lord let's get back to our steady here so you see that that the gospel story surround and and it building a picture no wonder why Jesus was a friend to to to to to the house no wonder why when that woman was delivered from the seven demons she sat down all the time and just listened to she found so she found comfort in the words of Jesus because the spirit that was making her to run in the streets have left her a prophet of God will say to us amen he says Mary Magdalene she she knew his power she knew there was something about him was different from anyone else she has seven devil cast out of her everybody that ever been free from the Devils by the power of Jesus Christ knows where they are standing praise the Lord amen if you are delivered you know where you are standing if you are delivered you will not be able to find your way back because he takes the habit amen he takes the habit their desire that's what I mean sorry he takes the desire that's where the Holy Ghost does you might think foolish like you used to the things you used to do they will come through your mind but the desire to go and do it is not there amen the devil can blast your mind all he want to the strength to go and do it it's not there then he says no one no one presence and ever be the same person anymore you are changed there is something happening to you oh you can stand off and uh whatever it is and imagine this and accept this and and accepting thinking and curious to your logic and all of that something like that we believe in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and when you come into His presence there is something that happened in your life amen praise the Lord if it does not happen to you which means you have not got a hold of him that's right you came you came to church and you got shot of coming to his presence sure because this is not his presence this building his presence is the atmosphere that the word creates the thing that makes you to step in and say Amen praise the Lord are we together okay Let's Stay Together and you and and you are never the same one same uh uh same animal a man that ever been in the presence of Christ so she has Seven Devils cast out of her pride and anything and she thought she was so pretty she thought she was so pretty you see how she got some of her evil spirit on her when she thought she was so pretty she got into the state of self-worship that's why it would do self-washing it's all about yourself praise the Lord now not only girls do it boys also do it praise the Lord when we just get so much concerned about our outward appearance how how we appeared and and and no attention to what's going down in our spirit she thought she was so pretty and because of that she got a proud Spirit on her and people a proud spirit is a religious spirit if you don't know it's more daily when it's religious Isaiah tore us of Lucifer how he taught in his heart that was that was that was his fault and without Pride Spirit he was able to deceive three quarters of the Angels yeah she thought she was so pretty and there was no one like her but when Jesus spoke and said be thou clinch oh that left her she became a new person amen she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own sight it's not that she was dressing dirty but the kind of for self-image that she have for herself if she was dressing it was by the scripture to the glory of God Amen now for self-presentation she became a new person she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own sight she wrapped herself in the Rob of meekness and gentleness and follow the master she loved him she loved him she love him if you put the story together if you just read the account of the disciples and put the story because I I think it's in Luke Luke 7 says Simon place was in Bethany where where was Lazarus house in Bethany so if you put the story together I'm just I'm creating the picture in your mind here amen I'm not interpreting scripture interpretation of scriptures for a prophet I'm only creating a picture right inspiration is different from interpretation many times people think about inspiration you are no no no no no it's completely different inspiration is to draw the people that's why some people can dramatize when they are preaching it's an inspiration it's a Channel of gifts to be able to draw you in create a picture are we together now so we see here he says uh okay I have to find a place to close here now I have to find a place to close on on setting sound there was there was another yes another I don't know where I put it maybe I left it out that's that's fine on on settings sound lucky look in the Bible times some of the best that come was Mary Magdalene some of the best that come was Mary Magdalene out of who he he cast Seven Devils to them that received much they appreciate much to people that have really experienced the grace of God in their life delivering them from Habits and things they know how to appreciate God for people that are just sticking around creating their own self-righteousness they don't know how to appreciate the grace of God she was one of the best of the scripture the Bible says she anointed him to his resurrection and she was the first that saw him you have never loved her before she got delivered you have never loved her you will have a have all the uglier thing to say about her yes praise the Lord but she was one of the best of the scripture Jesus said wherever this gospel is preached her art will never be forgiven forgotten praise the Lord now so let's wrap this whole thing up let's wrap this whole thing up because after this I want us to just have a have a little prayer meeting here and uh I don't want anybody going home with any kind of a wrong Spirit on them and I just I mean when you come to expose in spirit you have to be awake this is real young people this is real this is real you see all of those boys are taking drugs and running on the street yelling over their hair rolling on the ground they are possessed with evil spirits praise the Lord some people just get it by watching some kind of a stupid thing on the internet true you can contact an evil spirit and they can torment you the rest of your life until God be gracious to you now so when brother Branham teach demonology he teach demonology in three Reigns he teaches demon knowledge in a Physical Realm which of course he said that is responsible for our sicknesses and he he taught demonology in the spiritual Realm and he taught demonology that he called enticing spirit so that's the three realm of demonology brother Brandon preach now he's going to draw a story here I want you to listen to us listen to me before we pray he says here in demonology too the religious dream he says and I have got a vision wrote out here I want you people to get the benefit of faith what happened in December I was in the room one morning when the angel of the Lord came in you see when I was over there I disobeyed God and I picked up I remember that was over in South Africa but Brandon went for the campaign and the Lord told him to go with Sandy Jackson but he listened to the rest of the ministers because they have already booked you know they have booked they have taken money from their friends they wanted to have big campaigns and they put a lot of pressure on brother Brennan so brother Brandon had to go with them so that is what he's narrating him praise the Lord amen I keep quiet a little bit here because of the carnival humidity that was in this man's life with the kind of forgive that he had brother Brown I'm still waiting he's still high healing service people got healed during the meetings but he knew he was out of the way of God he never came by justifying himself he never came justifying himself he never came blaming those people he said I disobey and any man knows what I mean by this it's a parasite that gets nearly kill you and because I have done something God told me not to do how many heard the story of faith I guess some of you I know the folks of the Tabernacle had a story God told me to go told me to go to a place and to stay away from this place and then go back over to another place so he was supposed to go to Cindy Jackson God wanted him to take a rest from the Johannesburg meetings and and go to Sunny Jackson and then he was supposed to go to Delbert because in the vision that he saw of South Africa it was the black people that was in the vision so he was supposed to go to to Dublin but in South Africa at the time apata was ruling and those ministers that hosted brother Branham in in Johannesburg was trying to stop him from going to Delvin praise praise the Lord maybe he might answer some of your racist question around the message there was no streak of racism in their prophet of God this is not a white man message this is a message for the children of God I've done something that God told me not to do how many hear the story okay he says he gives the people on the Tabernacle there he says and God told me to go to a place and stay away from this place and then go back over to to another place and I let the preachers talk me out of it now preachers are wonderful I'm one of them praise the Lord preachers are wonderful and they are my brothers but you mind what God tells you wish me no matter what a preacher says bring it back to the word This Is What God Says bring it back toward the word God don't play favoritism when Moses disobeyed he stopped him from seeing the Promised Land says preachers are wonderful they are my brother but you mind what God tells you that's right see you got one Mission now listen to this now listen to this brother Branham is preaching a religious realm of demonology and now he's he's creating a scene to say disobeying the word of God made him to be exposed to Demons those amoeba were demons praise the Lord amen betterbam never went around uh uh Barfield in the South African water or run around to parties and and or living wrong he just disobeyed God's word and he got exposed to Demons that was afflecting his body now listen to this now he says how many how many remember one time there was two prophets in the bible and one of them said the Lord told me to go to a certain place that's in the book of Kings the man of Judah the man of Judea that a young man passing and the law says don't stop don't eat don't turn around just go forward and we'll make him to turn around a preacher a prophet he says the Lord revealed to me last night that you should come to my house and have a meal I think you need to go and read that in your Bible what was happening demonology that God killed that Prophet Allah no God slay the man of Judah because he disobeyed God's word then brother Branham says religious spirit religious demon it can prophesied in God's name they can tell you a dream and tell you a vision it can be exactly to the place you love the Lord praise the Lord oh Hallelujah what a wonderful wonderful God we have amen am I scaring you okay we just pray for you that's all we can do so you read first king chapter 13 when you get home you see the entire story there don't have time to read it so you can write in your notes and read the whole thing he said so you remember one time two prophets in the bible and one of them the Lord told him said you go and to a setting place and don't don't you come to him you go back another way and so far don't come back and said don't you eat or drink while you are dead and another true Prophet another truth prophet met him and said the Lord met me after he met you and said come to my house and the prophet listened to what the other one said and lost his life see you do what God tells you to do regardless of what anybody anybody as she says and just like I said God will not tell you anything out of his word so you have to bring it back to the word of God foreign let me let me start just close up with another one yeah I know what you want at the end time but when the Seven Seals become and open those Mysteries and reveal them that's when the frogs three unclean Spirit like frost come out come out to manifest themselves a trinity Doctrine against the truth before it was honored political powers it was able to unite the threeisms but when the seals were opened God expose it as a religious demon a trinity spirit that have fought against the truth all alone he's never able to bring the people to a life in Christ it's enough to bring you to a church member it can even make you argue and fight against the word of God is never able to bring you to a talking life praise the Lord now I wanted to go in this way Mary Magdalene in the first resurrection praise the Lord can I close with this brother bam said in a message in deckman he says as I read a book one time called the prince of the House of David if you have not read that book you should find it and read it and this is even there they are even audio uh uh I listen to the entire all the beautiful book beautiful but dramatized it's a fiction story is a fiction story praise the Lord it's a fiction story so you just you have to you have to uh but it's a story that is dramatized of of uh it's it's fictionally dramatized of of a ladies testimony so it's a true testimony but it there is law of fiction that is hard to Aid to make make the story look beautiful so he says here it was it was uh wrote bad in Graham the attorney Graham wonderful book It's a drama supposed to be a partly truth of some old manuscript that was taking off of a woman knee again now you see and that's where sometimes um you know we we as as message Believers we we have to be we have to learn you know and just pray that the Lord will be able to help us you know uh [Music] this this prophet of God was was of seventh grade education and there's nothing you cannot you can actually expect to come out of him if God never brought it out of him praise the Lord well you see he brought a brand name never used his education as a crutches he never used it as a crutches neither did he use his Divine gift to just go to bed and sleep right right no the prophet of God exercised himself in reading things he read history he read things praise the Lord he was a man that gave himself to Mush reading and praying brother Brandon will lock himself up and read history just like I said Wednesday night because of the responsibility that was on his shoulder he could have come and taught us that everything he said the angel told him to say it brother Branham never said that don't say that now everything brother Branham said the angel told him to say he said but when it comes to those seals he said I have never preached a message every time brother Branham said it before he comes out an angel comes down and correct his note praise the Lord now he's telling us something here I just have to say they are so uh to make a point praise the lord we find people also that go you know and read different books and they're just flying all over the place you have to bring it back to the word amen some people don't know how to use the thinking man's favor if you don't know how to use the thinking benefit read your Bible and the message praise the Lord just read your Bible in the message book he says she went over to Palestine from down in Egypt to Cairo I was even thinking I have the audio series am I talked to brother Andrews and see how we can put it on the website so you can be able to listen to the entire audio series [Music] we stay we're still working in the background there uh tank couple brother and the other brothers that are working on those things and uh down in Egypt to carrot I believe it was to finish her education and she was there during the time of Christ and she was supposed to write back to her father now he's giving us the background of this book what what inspired this entire Prince of the House of David right back to her father it did be good if you pick it up and read it now so rabban asked encouraging you to read amen now but what is in there that is that is here he says we find that in their book this uh idea whatever name is wrote back she said on the day of the crucification because in her story she she happened to become a friend to Lazarus family that's how she came in contact with Jesus so she was writing everything that she she saw back to to her father because her father was a devoted Jews now on the date of the crucification that Mary Magdalene upon whom he cast out Seven Devils this is what she said now run out before the crowd and said what have he done you think about it this woman running out before the the Jewish others and the Roman soldiers right there at the crucification what have he done what have he done what was making her to do that because of the experience that she had a truth has made us free she was not embarrassed to defend the word what has he done what has he done only heal the sake and tried to deliver those that were in praising what have he done but good and somebody said and a man slapped how punch across the yard almost and said will
