[53:40] scripture yet i will i will i will share
[53:43] with you
[53:45] why
[53:46] i'm going into this
[53:48] tonight
[53:53] praise the lord
[53:57] amen amen
[54:15] are we together
[54:24] verse 23
[54:26] genesis 25 23
[54:30] and the law said unto her to rebecca two
[54:33] nations
[54:35] i in that womb
[54:40] and two mana of people
[54:43] shall be separated from the bowels and
[54:47] the one people shall be stronger than
[54:50] the other people and the other shall
[54:53] self the younger
[54:56] praise the lord
[54:57] and when her days was
[55:00] to be delivered

[55:04] and when her days to be delivered were
[55:06] fulfilled behold
[55:08] there were twins in her womb
[55:11] praise the lord
[55:13] then let's drop down a little bit
[55:22] verse 27 and the boys growed in either
[55:26] and ether was a corning hunter a man of
[55:29] the field and jacob
[55:31] was a plain man
[55:33] dwelling in tents
[55:36] and isaac loved easter because
[55:40] he did eat of his venison but rebecca
[55:43] loved jacob
[55:47] and jacob
[55:48] saw pottage and israel came from the
[55:51] field
[55:52] and he was faint and israel said to
[55:54] jacob femin i pray thee
[55:57] with
[55:58] the same rare party for i'm faint
[56:01] therefore
[56:03] was his name
[56:05] called edom
[56:07] and jacob said cell mean
[56:10] this did that birthright
[56:12] and ether said behold
[56:16] i am at the point
[56:18] of death
[56:19] and
[56:20] and what prophet shall this birthright
[56:23] do to me
[56:26] and jacob said sword
[56:29] to me this day
[56:31] and his word unto him and he sold his
[56:34] birthright unto jacob
[56:37] amen
[56:39] let's read the last verse
[56:41] then jacob
[56:44] gave easter bread and pottage of lentil
[56:47] and he did eat
[56:50] and drink and rolls up and went his way
[56:54] does easter despise
[56:57] his birthright

[59:44] you and uh
[59:49] and it's good to have our dear sister
[59:51] with us tonight
[59:53] praise the lord so uh i just just from
[59:56] the reading tonight you'll get an idea
[59:58] that i want to i want to talk a little
[1:00:00] bit on the birthright but the reason why
[1:00:03] i want to talk on the birthright i might
[1:00:06] not get into it tonight but the reason
[1:00:09] why i want to talk on the birthright is
[1:00:11] to go back to
[1:00:13] what we've been talking about
[1:00:15] okay
[1:00:17] okay like i always do i think i did the
[1:00:19] same thing here
[1:00:20] brother hilary wrote a prayer prayer
[1:00:22] burning and
[1:00:24] experiencing pain in his stomach
[1:00:27] and he want us to just remember him
[1:00:30] and let just pray father
[1:00:32] we we
[1:00:33] we know lord god even if we did forget
[1:00:36] just as our brother took the pain you
[1:00:38] remember lord what his need was but
[1:00:41] father lord garden and and
[1:00:44] as we are human lord we never want
[1:00:47] anyone to feel that their need is
[1:00:49] despised so we left our brother up to
[1:00:51] you we want to thank you father for even
[1:00:54] helping him to lead a son
[1:00:56] on a painful stomach but we pray that
[1:00:59] you will touch him oh god father and
[1:01:02] touch all of your children lord that are
[1:01:04] having one pain or another in their body
[1:01:06] tonight we love you
[1:01:09] we appreciate you father
[1:01:11] in jesus name
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:17] praise the lord
[1:01:20] praise the lord
[1:01:23] okay i forget what i was saying but what
[1:01:26] i was saying is it does not matter
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:31] the word matters so we will just trust
[1:01:33] the lord tonight and he will help us
[1:01:36] and uh uh like i said on sunday that was
[1:01:40] studying on uh the attributes of god if
[1:01:43] we actually
[1:01:44] decide to go in and just talk about the
[1:01:47] attributes of god is a subject that we
[1:01:49] could preach until we go in the rapture
[1:01:52] and then uh
[1:01:54] since we'll be under the blood in the
[1:01:56] millennium maybe we could still be doing
[1:01:58] some preaching there
[1:02:00] praise the lord
[1:02:01] amen
[1:02:03] you know
[1:02:08] i don't know if we should we should make
[1:02:10] it a subject
[1:02:11] about preaching in the millennium
[1:02:14] you know but one thing i noticed that we
[1:02:16] will we will be worshipping in the
[1:02:17] millennium amen
[1:02:19] praise the lord
[1:02:21] we will be
[1:02:22] we will be worshiping in the millennium
[1:02:24] we will still be honored the blood
[1:02:26] so uh
[1:02:27] uh
[1:02:29] [Music]
[1:02:31] so whichever way
[1:02:32] the lamb would be the light
[1:02:34] you know the line would be the minister
[1:02:37] so we will be learning more about him
[1:02:41] and we will still be
[1:02:43] in in a discovery state in the learning
[1:02:46] stage so we will not be in that place
[1:02:50] where we will know everything
[1:02:52] no eternity will bring that to us
[1:02:55] not the millennium
[1:02:57] praise the lord
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:01] so uh
[1:03:03] but i mean like i said talking about the
[1:03:05] attributes of god is something that we
[1:03:07] could talk right into internet
[1:03:09] that's what i wanted to say
[1:03:11] so uh but
[1:03:13] again just to back up and to and to kind
[1:03:16] of
[1:03:17] uh cap ourselves
[1:03:19] the the full knowledge of god that
[1:03:22] attribute
[1:03:23] was one of the the the attributes
[1:03:27] that many scholars you know uh
[1:03:32] in studying
[1:03:33] that subject
[1:03:35] you know there were many controversies
[1:03:37] around it
[1:03:38] you know
[1:03:39] because when you talk about full
[1:03:41] knowledge
[1:03:42] uh it you know the the
[1:03:45] the webster dictionary or the dictionary
[1:03:47] meaning
[1:03:48] will point you to
[1:03:50] you know knowing something beforehand
[1:03:54] and uh
[1:03:56] you know and there are other some
[1:03:58] uh deep definitions there but what we
[1:04:01] were trying to deal with
[1:04:04] is
[1:04:05] that point of teaching
[1:04:07] were
[1:04:08] uh
[1:04:09] uh
[1:04:10] you know many of us
[1:04:13] uh
[1:04:15] were taught about god for knowledge in a
[1:04:18] sense of where
[1:04:20] you know he knew that we will we will
[1:04:22] want to be safe
[1:04:24] and because of that he saved us
[1:04:27] you know or godfall knew that we will
[1:04:31] love him
[1:04:34] and he predestinated us that was a great
[1:04:37] line of teaching you know in in ages
[1:04:41] gone by and which of course it does not
[1:04:44] rightly center with the word
[1:04:47] there is a truth there but it is not
[1:04:50] fully balanced
[1:04:52] amen so as we look through the the the
[1:04:56] quote uh and the message in the
[1:04:59] scripture we realized that it was what
[1:05:02] god projected
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:06] it was what god projected you know
[1:05:08] everything came out of him
[1:05:11] without him there was nothing
[1:05:13] praise the lord amen
[1:05:16] so
[1:05:17] uh brother branham we read a little bit
[1:05:19] on that on sunday where brother branham
[1:05:21] took uh
[1:05:23] uh from uh
[1:05:25] the message
[1:05:27] you know uh uh
[1:05:29] uh who is this
[1:05:31] machisa deck
[1:05:33] and and and then he dwelt on that a
[1:05:36] little bit and make us to know
[1:05:39] you know how the self-existing god and
[1:05:42] and then we went right into
[1:05:44] into god dwelling alone
[1:05:47] and and that is also another place to
[1:05:50] work is greatly misunderstood you know
[1:05:53] brother branham says you know you know
[1:05:55] being alone with god you know or a man
[1:05:57] standing alone you know uh
[1:06:00] you can you are you can never amount to
[1:06:02] anything until you stand alone so that
[1:06:06] language standalone has made many people
[1:06:09] to think that they can become
[1:06:11] independent believers
[1:06:13] and work their way into the rapture
[1:06:20] you know
[1:06:21] you know in a walk with god
[1:06:23] you know he was the only one man
[1:06:27] that could fulfill that scripture
[1:06:32] the only one man that could fulfill that
[1:06:34] scripture if there was any other man
[1:06:37] to fulfill
[1:06:38] a a one-man walk with god's scripture
[1:06:44] it would corrupt the scripture that says
[1:06:48] we are baptized into one body
[1:06:54] the only one man that can do that is the
[1:06:56] one man with many members body
[1:07:04] you see so that was where i tried to go
[1:07:06] on on sunday talking about elohim
[1:07:10] dwelling alone you know with his
[1:07:12] attributes and and just just trying to
[1:07:16] talk about that dwelling alone and and
[1:07:19] over and over if you if you check if you
[1:07:22] if you really started the message you
[1:07:23] would see every time brother branham
[1:07:25] talks about being alone is always being
[1:07:29] alone with god
[1:07:33] praise the lord
[1:07:34] it's always been alone
[1:07:37] with god
[1:07:41] and when you talk about being alone with
[1:07:43] god you have to bring it in the context
[1:07:46] of the word
[1:07:48] right
[1:07:50] praise the lord
[1:07:52] amen
[1:07:53] if you say you are well i'm alone with
[1:07:55] god and
[1:07:56] and but yet the word of god says do not
[1:07:59] forsake the assembling of the believers
[1:08:05] praise the lord amen
[1:08:09] spoken word is the original see brother
[1:08:11] branham says life comes through the body
[1:08:16] cut this hand from my body it will not
[1:08:18] be a life
[1:08:22] for any member of your body to live it
[1:08:25] has to be attached to their body
[1:08:28] life comes through the body
[1:08:36] so that was one of the reason why we
[1:08:38] went down we went down and you know me
[1:08:40] when i get dead it becomes a rabbit
[1:08:43] trail
[1:08:44] we start going and it's hard to find the
[1:08:46] end
[1:08:49] but as i was as i was really studying
[1:08:51] the subject i was looking into the
[1:08:53] subject it's something that i've looked
[1:08:55] into you know years back it was just
[1:08:57] because brother peterson
[1:08:59] read that quote from uh from adoption
[1:09:02] so it just it just triggered that thing
[1:09:05] i mean i say i have to pick this up
[1:09:07] and deal with it amen
[1:09:09] there was nothing wrong with the code
[1:09:11] there was nothing wrong with the service
[1:09:13] the word was just in place i just fed as
[1:09:16] a pastor i need to take up that subject
[1:09:20] and let's just lick the honey that is on
[1:09:22] the rock
[1:09:25] that's all i was doing praise the lord
[1:09:28] so don't don't misunderstand me and
[1:09:29] think that i'm correcting anything i'm
[1:09:31] not correcting anything and sometimes
[1:09:33] when you take this and people think well
[1:09:35] maybe you want to correct the prophet
[1:09:36] the prophet said it i believe it yeah
[1:09:38] the prophet said it but he even said it
[1:09:41] it's from his own word
[1:09:43] right amen brother branham said we read
[1:09:46] here
[1:09:47] on on sunday
[1:09:50] he says here
[1:09:55] if i will be able to find it now
[1:10:19] talking about a thought
[1:10:21] a tortoise press is the word but it it
[1:10:25] has to be a thought first
[1:10:28] so it's god's attribute then it becomes
[1:10:31] a top then the word notice though who
[1:10:34] have those
[1:10:36] who have uh tonight internal life was
[1:10:39] with him
[1:10:41] and in him in his thinking before there
[1:10:45] ever was
[1:10:46] an angel-style cherubin anything else
[1:10:49] that's in tenor
[1:10:50] and if you have internal life you always
[1:10:53] was
[1:10:54] not your being
[1:10:57] not your being not your body
[1:11:01] not this flesh you have always been
[1:11:04] but in a sea form
[1:11:07] that comes back to the sea
[1:11:10] world
[1:11:16] so if we start to talk about sun
[1:11:18] ambassador
[1:11:19] you will see why the scripture deals
[1:11:22] with sun ambassador
[1:11:27] because son
[1:11:29] comes from the seed word
[1:11:31] that's the reason why a song will not
[1:11:33] argue with the word
[1:11:35] he will take correction from the word
[1:11:38] because that's where his origin is
[1:11:43] a man can keep this body this being
[1:11:46] around the world in church and never
[1:11:48] take correction
[1:11:56] we read that to you before brother
[1:11:58] branham she is not this body that is
[1:11:59] predestinated
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:04] it's the thought that god heard of you
[1:12:07] and then when you look in the scripture
[1:12:09] also and you and you and you deal with
[1:12:12] uh
[1:12:12] uh let's let's take a few scriptures
[1:12:15] here tonight i'm i'm just all over the
[1:12:17] place
[1:12:20] amen i'm just all over the place tonight
[1:12:26] are we together
[1:12:28] praise the lord
[1:12:31] amen amen
[1:12:36] me know
[1:12:38] let me do something we read one
[1:12:40] scripture and i'm i'm going in another
[1:12:42] way tonight
[1:13:06] uh
[1:13:13] let's look at first period chapter
[1:13:16] one
[1:13:20] first peter chapter one
[1:13:32] now what i want to what i want to
[1:13:34] establish when you actually study it
[1:13:35] unfold on full knowledge you will
[1:13:37] realize every word that the bible talks
[1:13:39] about it is that it is not the act of
[1:13:42] the believer
[1:13:43] that the bible referred to as being
[1:13:46] uh uh has been god having full knowledge
[1:13:49] of not the act of what you would do
[1:13:52] but the person
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:58] is not the act
[1:14:00] so that's what this whole subject comes
[1:14:02] back to
[1:14:05] for you to say that god
[1:14:08] predestinated you or elected you because
[1:14:10] he he knew that you will love him is an
[1:14:13] act
[1:14:15] is not the act he predestinated you
[1:14:17] because you were part of him
[1:14:20] now for what you will do
[1:14:23] not the art
[1:14:29] praise the lord
[1:14:31] are we together
[1:14:33] so that that is one of the call that is
[1:14:35] that is right there when you when you
[1:14:37] study the scripture then you study the
[1:14:40] message the thing about it did is that
[1:14:42] we must realize as as privileged people
[1:14:45] that we are god never sent us a
[1:14:47] theologian brother branham was not a
[1:14:49] theologian brother branham was a prophet
[1:14:51] and and the work of a prophet is to
[1:14:54] speak the word of god in sea form
[1:14:58] the prophet speak those words there's a
[1:15:00] sea of internal life in that word
[1:15:03] amen he might not pronounce his words
[1:15:06] right his expression might not be right
[1:15:09] but you see when you follow the thought
[1:15:11] of what he's saying you will realize
[1:15:13] that he's coming back to the sea form of
[1:15:17] of of of of god's word
[1:15:20] praise the lord
[1:15:25] that's the reason why you never find
[1:15:26] brother branham you know uh uh uh uh
[1:15:30] trying to explain scripture scarlett
[1:15:33] explains scripture
[1:15:35] but the work of a prophet is to
[1:15:37] interpret
[1:15:38] scripture two different things
[1:15:45] as scholar will say that the synaptic
[1:15:47] gospel and you go to the root word of
[1:15:49] days and you go to the root word of
[1:15:51] death a prophet don't have time for that
[1:15:59] praise the lord
[1:16:02] amen
[1:16:11] i asked you to turn to a scripture now
[1:16:13] and i did not myself
[1:16:15] uh
[1:16:16] first feeding
[1:16:18] chapter one
[1:16:21] if you just see peter
[1:16:24] in this letter
[1:16:27] talking about
[1:16:28] to them that he's addressing the letter
[1:16:30] to
[1:16:32] it is not
[1:16:33] about what they will do
[1:16:36] but he's pl talking to the people you
[1:16:38] know placing those people
[1:16:40] amen
[1:16:52] amen
[1:17:01] verse 2 elect
[1:17:03] i call into the full knowledge of god
[1:17:06] the father
[1:17:09] true sanctification
[1:17:12] of the spirit
[1:17:13] unto obedience
[1:17:16] and sprinkling of the blood of jesus
[1:17:19] christ
[1:17:20] grace
[1:17:21] unto you in peace
[1:17:23] be multiplied
[1:17:26] praise the lord
[1:17:27] amen
[1:17:28] so if you even look at this and and if
[1:17:31] you just want to stretch the thought of
[1:17:33] what we have just read you'll realize
[1:17:36] that you know uh
[1:17:39] all of those things were projected like
[1:17:41] i said
[1:17:42] sanctification of the spirit was
[1:17:45] projected
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:50] obedience
[1:17:53] and the sprinkling of the blood and all
[1:17:54] of that but so you you see where where
[1:17:57] where i'm trying to drive tour with with
[1:17:59] all of this
[1:18:01] because
[1:18:03] we have been given the ministry that has
[1:18:05] rightly divided the world of truth to us
[1:18:08] amen and we might not just take one uh
[1:18:12] uh
[1:18:13] line of cult or one scripture and just
[1:18:15] run with it you know and build our own
[1:18:18] security you know i'm pre-destined that
[1:18:20] i'm elected and all of that
[1:18:24] only because
[1:18:27] you know uh i mean we are walking and
[1:18:29] fading and all that you know they did
[1:18:32] there so they are now predestinated you
[1:18:34] know they did that they are no longer of
[1:18:35] us because they left us in all of that
[1:18:38] right
[1:18:39] so but let me come to something here uh
[1:18:43] that that brings me to this subject of
[1:18:45] the birthright if we have time tonight i
[1:18:48] actually will
[1:18:50] deal with it on sunday but just to kind
[1:18:52] of lay the foundation here so uh we can
[1:18:55] be able to appreciate the subject
[1:18:58] uh
[1:19:01] birthright
[1:19:03] one word is it actually caught my mind
[1:19:07] recently when when my nephew passed away
[1:19:10] and talking with the family and all of
[1:19:12] the struggle that was going on there uh
[1:19:14] and and you know
[1:19:16] the
[1:19:17] you know the
[1:19:18] this word came to my mind and it a plays
[1:19:21] on my mind because of
[1:19:24] the word right
[1:19:26] okay
[1:19:27] we realize that birthright
[1:19:30] is given to the firstborn
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:35] is given to the firstborn
[1:19:38] and
[1:19:40] it is because of his position
[1:19:45] as we will see in scripture
[1:19:48] but
[1:19:49] it does not make him any different from
[1:19:51] the other children
[1:19:53] sure
[1:19:54] praise the lord
[1:19:56] it's just a right
[1:19:59] and that is the reason why stricturally
[1:20:01] that right can be taken also
[1:20:05] sure
[1:20:08] i mean
[1:20:09] it's always is is is is also and because
[1:20:13] the the conversation came in on the
[1:20:15] right of the of the wife you know uh
[1:20:18] i mean
[1:20:19] because because she's the wife
[1:20:23] she's giving this right
[1:20:27] it does not make her better than the
[1:20:29] mother
[1:20:31] of the individual
[1:20:34] amen or because he's the husband he's
[1:20:37] giving this right it does not make him
[1:20:39] better than the girl's father
[1:20:42] it's just a right that is that has been
[1:20:44] given to him by the union of marriage
[1:20:52] praise the lord
[1:20:54] amen
[1:20:55] now so for us to be able to to
[1:20:58] appreciate
[1:21:01] predestination election for knowledge
[1:21:04] being ordained by god
[1:21:08] we will we will appreciate it
[1:21:10] in a sense that is a right
[1:21:17] and we obtain this right
[1:21:20] by being accepted
[1:21:22] in the beloved
[1:21:28] the lord
[1:21:29] amen
[1:21:32] so
[1:21:33] understanding
[1:21:34] the the the birthright understanding
[1:21:38] structure of birthright
[1:21:40] understanding the importance of the
[1:21:42] breath right
[1:21:45] will make us to appreciate
[1:21:50] god's plan of redemption
[1:21:56] the lord
[1:21:57] amen
[1:21:59] do you believe there are people that
[1:22:01] believe they are predestinated
[1:22:04] they are elects of god
[1:22:06] but they will miss the rapture
[1:22:09] yeah definitely amen
[1:22:15] why because coming in knowledge of the
[1:22:18] word of god they embraced that truth
[1:22:21] but yet they did not have the right
[1:22:24] sure
[1:22:26] because the right of being an elected
[1:22:29] child of god is just not a title
[1:22:32] right
[1:22:34] the right of calling yourself a bride
[1:22:36] what is that what is the need of calling
[1:22:37] yourself a bride when you know you're
[1:22:40] not actually married
[1:22:43] sure yeah
[1:22:45] are you are you seeing the top line
[1:22:47] where i'm going
[1:22:50] so to really
[1:22:52] appreciate
[1:22:54] to be able to appreciate the subject
[1:22:58] of his divine nature that has been given
[1:23:01] to us to appreciate being the act the
[1:23:05] yeah the attributes of god the seed of
[1:23:07] god and appreciate all of god's
[1:23:10] attribute that he has he has given to us
[1:23:13] for you to really appreciate that
[1:23:16] you have to appreciate what the breath
[1:23:18] right is
[1:23:24] praise the lord
[1:23:26] amen
[1:23:28] so what i would do is that i would i
[1:23:30] would go to the end and then go back to
[1:23:32] the beginning and bring you to the end
[1:23:35] praise the lord
[1:23:37] amen
[1:23:39] you remember we we read from the
[1:23:40] scripture
[1:23:42] that he is the firstborn
[1:23:45] among
[1:23:47] many brethrens
[1:23:49] amen he is the firstborn
[1:23:57] he is the firstborn so because
[1:24:01] christ is the firstborn he has the
[1:24:04] breath right
[1:24:08] praise the lord
[1:24:10] so for us to enjoy the benefit of the
[1:24:14] breath right he brought us in him
[1:24:22] we are all baptized into one body
[1:24:27] anything out of that body you don't have
[1:24:30] a right to the rapture you don't have
[1:24:32] the right to redemption you don't have
[1:24:34] the right to call yourself a
[1:24:36] predestinated seed anything out of that
[1:24:39] body because he is the firstborn every
[1:24:42] right of the father belongs to him
[1:24:50] so for the person to think that
[1:24:53] god knew that i will love him i will
[1:24:55] serve him
[1:24:57] he knew that
[1:24:59] so he predestinated me
[1:25:02] it sounds like your self-possession
[1:25:06] except value that you had
[1:25:10] and god said i can't miss that one
[1:25:13] no
[1:25:14] i can't miss that one
[1:25:15] he having something that i need
[1:25:19] if there is any good
[1:25:21] in you it's because he gave it to you
[1:25:30] and then when we understand that
[1:25:32] then we appreciate grace
[1:25:34] then we walk humbly
[1:25:37] before him i was i was reading one of my
[1:25:39] devotion what i read charles bargin
[1:25:43] he said
[1:25:45] if god
[1:25:47] should take his grace
[1:25:49] off of the most holiest man
[1:25:52] he will become the most
[1:25:55] faithiest man
[1:25:57] the most wicked man you have ever known
[1:26:04] in the book of kings
[1:26:07] elisha came to
[1:26:09] to uh to that young man
[1:26:15] and said
[1:26:16] tomorrow
[1:26:20] you will wish ward against israel
[1:26:25] tomorrow
[1:26:26] you're going to rip the women in the
[1:26:28] town
[1:26:29] and you're going to ravish
[1:26:33] the babies
[1:26:35] praise the lord
[1:26:37] he says what am i a dog
[1:26:42] am i a dog for me to do that
[1:26:46] now this was a prophet if he only knew
[1:26:50] who was talking to him
[1:26:52] the word of the prophet anointed him for
[1:26:55] that service
[1:26:59] and it was on his fight
[1:27:02] that the dogs lake the blood of ahab
[1:27:14] praise the lord
[1:27:17] where are we tonight
[1:27:21] amen
[1:27:32] now you have to also realize that this
[1:27:34] is this is not a subject
[1:27:37] you know
[1:27:39] to create fear
[1:27:42] i mean if you're having fear it's in you
[1:27:44] it's not coming from me
[1:27:47] praise the lord
[1:27:48] i'm not preaching firing a brainstorm
[1:27:50] message here
[1:27:52] praise the lord
[1:27:54] is just
[1:27:55] a subject
[1:27:57] because we are a people
[1:28:02] that have been predestinated
[1:28:05] to give christ the preeminence
[1:28:09] and you can never
[1:28:11] put him
[1:28:12] first in your life
[1:28:15] until you really know who he is
[1:28:21] the bride that is promised
[1:28:23] in this age not to see death
[1:28:28] not to see death
[1:28:33] praise the lord
[1:28:35] is that bride
[1:28:38] that we give him the preeminence
[1:28:40] right we should make wish making him
[1:28:43] all in all
[1:28:45] the first
[1:28:47] in everything that matters
[1:28:50] praise the lord
[1:28:52] amen
[1:28:53] so you see it does not have to do with
[1:28:55] anything of how long you've been serving
[1:28:57] god how long you've been in the church
[1:28:58] how long you've been believing the
[1:29:00] message does not have to do anything
[1:29:01] with that
[1:29:03] you think about that it just made you to
[1:29:06] appreciate the grace of god
[1:29:10] it just make you to look back and say
[1:29:12] the lord god that have kept me out of
[1:29:14] these days he's able to kept keep me
[1:29:17] over the finish line
[1:29:19] amen
[1:29:22] praise the lord i mean with god we don't
[1:29:25] count years
[1:29:29] we don't count years with god
[1:29:32] because he's the asian of day
[1:29:35] so you don't count years with god you
[1:29:37] know i've been serving the law for 12
[1:29:39] years for 10 years for 15 years for 50
[1:29:41] years you don't count years with god
[1:29:44] because he's the asian of day
[1:29:52] and we also have a promise
[1:29:55] that they that know their god
[1:29:59] will be strong
[1:30:01] and do
[1:30:02] explode
[1:30:06] so
[1:30:06] we want to be strong in this time
[1:30:09] of
[1:30:11] of
[1:30:12] of fear
[1:30:15] i mean it's just a great fear among the
[1:30:17] people
[1:30:19] praise the lord
[1:30:23] just a great fear and i mean if the lord
[1:30:25] don't help us
[1:30:26] i mean we we all try to bring out all
[1:30:29] our spiritual weapon and you know our
[1:30:31] spiritual reason why we we choose to do
[1:30:34] this we choose not to do this
[1:30:36] i was talking with brother bill youngs
[1:30:39] he's uh
[1:30:41] he's too old for me to call him my
[1:30:43] friend but he's my friend
[1:30:46] and uh uh
[1:30:49] we do we do check he's one of the old
[1:30:51] men i checked him in all the time
[1:30:54] and we were talking from one thing to
[1:30:56] another you know and and i told him i
[1:30:58] said you know he was just talking about
[1:31:00] i mean just such a fear brother one you
[1:31:02] know i mean fear on the people every
[1:31:04] word
[1:31:05] i said yeah
[1:31:07] you know but the thing about it there is
[1:31:09] that we we have to realize
[1:31:11] that uh the scripture says the devil
[1:31:14] know that his time
[1:31:18] it's not short bro jordan it's finished
[1:31:23] it's out
[1:31:24] right
[1:31:26] and he's scared
[1:31:28] is the effect of his fear
[1:31:32] that is affecting the world
[1:31:40] is the effect of his fear
[1:31:44] that is affecting the world
[1:31:50] because he knows his time is out
[1:31:56] are we together
[1:31:59] you know so let's let's just enjoy the
[1:32:02] lord
[1:32:03] you know let's let's be grateful
[1:32:06] that we still have our doors open
[1:32:09] we can still be able to come together
[1:32:12] praise the lord
[1:32:13] and uh
[1:32:15] i mean those that can make it they can
[1:32:17] stay stream the service online
[1:32:20] you know and uh and and all of that
[1:32:24] and uh i would just say this
[1:32:27] you know uh uh
[1:32:31] as a church we try to
[1:32:34] encourage ourselves and and
[1:32:37] and discipline ourselves in as much as
[1:32:39] the lord can be able to help us
[1:32:42] we all need god's help praise the lord
[1:32:45] amen and we we put all of these things
[1:32:48] in place you know i mean if a person
[1:32:52] stays home and out of there you know
[1:32:55] brother brother wesley and sister
[1:32:57] carrick they drive two hours i believe
[1:32:59] they're following the service tonight
[1:33:01] you know brother wesley will call me in
[1:33:03] the week and say something he says and
[1:33:06] you call me and we talk a little bit and
[1:33:08] say but one we really enjoy the service
[1:33:10] on wayne's tonight you know we reeling
[1:33:12] and we talk and we just fellowship and
[1:33:14] all that
[1:33:15] you know so i mean
[1:33:17] uh a preacher will make the expression
[1:33:20] you know it's not the same you know
[1:33:22] being in service and following the
[1:33:24] service online don't allow that to get
[1:33:26] under your skin
[1:33:30] praise the lord
[1:33:33] amen
[1:33:34] you know when when when it is truth you
[1:33:37] say amen to the word
[1:33:39] but you don't take offense and say well
[1:33:41] i'm the one he's talking to because you
[1:33:42] know i don't come to church
[1:33:45] then you really get problems
[1:33:51] praise the lord
[1:33:53] because i mean if it is completely wrong
[1:33:55] then we as a church we are wrong for
[1:33:57] even hosting our service online sure
[1:34:01] but we did it to be able to facilitate
[1:34:03] the people that can make it here
[1:34:10] it is your responsibility
[1:34:13] to be in the spirit on the last day
[1:34:18] well let's go to the word tonight amen
[1:34:21] praise the lord
[1:34:23] i just want to take one quote
[1:34:25] from the message
[1:34:27] hearing recognizing acting on the word i
[1:34:30] read that tonight and then
[1:34:33] we share a few thoughts with you my time
[1:34:35] is almost up
[1:34:39] bill banham said jacob
[1:34:42] the reason that he choose
[1:34:44] to find the birthright
[1:34:48] regardless
[1:34:50] amen
[1:34:52] regardless
[1:34:54] he wanted to get it
[1:34:59] because
[1:35:02] that
[1:35:03] he know
[1:35:04] that birthright had the blessing
[1:35:10] amen
[1:35:11] praise the lord
[1:35:13] do you really think that's the reason
[1:35:16] why jacob wanted the breath right
[1:35:19] before jacob was even born
[1:35:22] the angel of the lord told rebecca
[1:35:25] the other
[1:35:27] we save the younger
[1:35:30] so there was something
[1:35:32] supernaturally dragging him
[1:35:36] that he could not understand
[1:35:38] sure
[1:35:40] praise the lord
[1:35:43] there was something
[1:35:44] supernaturally
[1:35:46] that was hidden in
[1:35:49] the gene of crookedness and lying and
[1:35:52] stealing and all the things that jacob
[1:35:55] had there was something that was lying
[1:35:57] there that was driving him
[1:36:13] the reason that he choose to find the
[1:36:16] bread fry regardless
[1:36:20] he wanted to get it because
[1:36:23] that he know the birthright had the
[1:36:26] blessing
[1:36:30] it held life
[1:36:33] praise the lord
[1:36:35] and that is the scene with us the breath
[1:36:38] right
[1:36:39] have the blessing
[1:36:44] the breath right
[1:36:46] holds
[1:36:49] the mystery
[1:36:51] of our life
[1:36:53] the will
[1:36:55] to live the will to serve god is in the
[1:36:58] birthright
[1:37:01] the will to surrender is in the
[1:37:03] birthright
[1:37:09] hell life
[1:37:15] he didn't care
[1:37:18] how
[1:37:20] it comes
[1:37:24] just so he got it
[1:37:29] praise the lord
[1:37:32] he didn't care
[1:37:34] the aqua sounds like a very
[1:37:37] careless tip me
[1:37:39] but it's truth
[1:37:42] because there is an internal thought
[1:37:45] behind that
[1:37:53] and another person would read this and
[1:37:55] think they can do anything
[1:37:57] they can lie they can cheat
[1:38:02] he didn't care how it comes
[1:38:05] just so he got it that was the mean
[1:38:08] thing
[1:38:13] while playing it comes on very matter he
[1:38:16] wanted it
[1:38:17] and he must have it
[1:38:20] and
[1:38:21] he got it
[1:38:23] blessed are they
[1:38:26] that do hunger now you see that's that
[1:38:29] is the beauty of a prophet
[1:38:31] ministry
[1:38:32] brother branham makes this
[1:38:34] this statement
[1:38:36] he make this expression
[1:38:39] no matter what it costs him
[1:38:48] but
[1:38:48] in another sense is that he's using a
[1:38:51] scripture here from from from the
[1:38:53] beatitude
[1:38:55] matthew chapter 5
[1:38:58] to to kind of explain
[1:39:02] to bring the scriptural sins
[1:39:07] the scriptural drive
[1:39:11] praise the lord
[1:39:17] because jacob really did not understand
[1:39:19] it
[1:39:20] amen
[1:39:22] do you think that he really sat down
[1:39:25] and says man i need to get this breath
[1:39:27] right
[1:39:28] i really need to get his breath right
[1:39:30] man i need this birth right
[1:39:34] praise the lord
[1:39:42] let me step back a little bit
[1:39:45] if i forget my trench of thought i would
[1:39:47] trust the holy spirit to remind me
[1:39:49] but you'll realize that in the scripture
[1:39:54] the subject of birthright
[1:39:57] never came up
[1:39:59] in the first twins that were born
[1:40:04] amen
[1:40:05] praise the lord
[1:40:09] king and evil were the first twins that
[1:40:11] were born
[1:40:13] but you realize that breath right the
[1:40:16] subject of bread fry never came
[1:40:23] if a person
[1:40:26] is is really spiritually inclined you
[1:40:29] will ask yourself
[1:40:31] why the subject of birthright never came
[1:40:34] god had to wait for the twins of esa and
[1:40:38] jacob before he brings up the subject of
[1:40:41] birthright
[1:40:44] he never addressed because there was
[1:40:47] nothing to be addressed
[1:40:49] uh uh
[1:40:50] adam i mean uh king and evil on
[1:40:53] breakfast
[1:40:57] it's a scriptural proof that they had
[1:41:00] different fathers
[1:41:01] [Laughter]
[1:41:05] so god will not he will not use an
[1:41:08] inspiration to address that subject
[1:41:11] right
[1:41:13] but here you will also see that in the
[1:41:16] early book of genesis the early part of
[1:41:18] genesis there you will realize
[1:41:21] that the holy spirit
[1:41:24] appointed seth
[1:41:30] amen
[1:41:31] appointed seth so even though
[1:41:35] the subject of birthright never came up
[1:41:38] with king and abel
[1:41:41] but the sergeant of brethren were also
[1:41:43] on the line because birthright goes to
[1:41:46] the firstborn
[1:41:52] praise the lord
[1:41:55] amen
[1:41:56] birthright goes to the firstborn and the
[1:41:59] bible says
[1:42:00] when seth was born
[1:42:03] the scripture says amen begin to call
[1:42:06] upon the name of the lord
[1:42:15] praise the lord
[1:42:19] amen
[1:42:27] so we see here
[1:42:32] that the birthright
[1:42:36] the birthright
[1:42:40] you know you know i mean in a day and
[1:42:42] age where
[1:42:43] you know of the people's right
[1:42:50] water time
[1:42:52] word
[1:42:56] the truthness of god's birthright will
[1:42:58] be on this plane
[1:43:02] praise the lord
[1:43:04] amen
[1:43:07] so brother branham says blessed is he
[1:43:09] blessed blessed are they that do hunger
[1:43:11] then test for righteousness
[1:43:13] and they shall be filled
[1:43:16] so we see this subject here
[1:43:19] becomes
[1:43:21] very
[1:43:22] important
[1:43:26] and that's the first time
[1:43:29] that
[1:43:31] god will bring out
[1:43:33] the subject he will he will you write
[1:43:36] about the birthright
[1:43:44] i don't want to get out of talk but i
[1:43:46] pray that lord would just be able
[1:43:49] to help us because you you also you also
[1:43:52] see that when you start looking at
[1:43:54] uh songs ambassadors but we will get to
[1:43:56] that uh as we would trust the lord to be
[1:43:59] able to help us here
[1:44:02] so you see the birthright
[1:44:05] all
[1:44:07] the the sons all the children
[1:44:10] that were born
[1:44:17] born of the same parents
[1:44:21] there was one
[1:44:23] that this right was given to
[1:44:26] over in exeter
[1:44:30] is the one that opened
[1:44:32] the matrix the first one that was born
[1:44:35] girl says
[1:44:37] uh they belong to me
[1:44:39] so the the first bone the birthright all
[1:44:43] tied together
[1:44:45] praise the lord
[1:44:46] amen but you see
[1:44:49] what what what we want to keep in mind
[1:44:51] here is that uh
[1:44:53] we want to we want to we we are we are
[1:44:56] traveling to the spiritual application
[1:44:59] we are traveling
[1:45:01] to understand
[1:45:04] what gives us the right
[1:45:07] to the holy ghost
[1:45:12] what gives us the right
[1:45:17] all of these spiritual
[1:45:19] principle
[1:45:21] as god will establish it
[1:45:24] among his people
[1:45:27] and and and and you know and and make it
[1:45:30] lord and ordinance
[1:45:32] it will be something that
[1:45:35] we will we will we will learn about and
[1:45:37] we will grow up and people were applied
[1:45:40] and they are formulating and because
[1:45:42] because it's a law of god we must also
[1:45:45] realize that that because it it's god
[1:45:48] that makes everything he's the one that
[1:45:50] makes nature
[1:45:53] praise the lord
[1:45:54] and because it's a lord of god you
[1:45:57] realize that people that don't even read
[1:45:59] the bible state state appreciate that
[1:46:02] lord
[1:46:03] they still follow that lord
[1:46:07] praise the lord
[1:46:08] it's among the hindus is among the
[1:46:10] muslims is more on the uh i mean uh
[1:46:14] the haunting talks like brother branham
[1:46:15] who says you know uh i mean it because
[1:46:18] it's a law of god
[1:46:25] but we have to also appreciate and
[1:46:27] realize that
[1:46:30] god when he was giving his ordinance and
[1:46:32] his statutes to the children of israel
[1:46:35] they were not laws as do and
[1:46:38] dumbs
[1:46:40] all of those statues
[1:46:42] were given to the children of israel it
[1:46:45] was god trying to bring his thoughts
[1:46:49] what was in his mind
[1:46:53] praise the lord
[1:46:55] because the first time he tried to speak
[1:46:57] to them it sounded like lightning
[1:46:59] intended
[1:47:04] so god his internal thoughts
[1:47:07] he will give it to them as statues
[1:47:11] praise the lord
[1:47:13] think about giving them a sour day of
[1:47:16] rest
[1:47:19] it goes back to his internal thoughts
[1:47:24] it goes back to the god that appreciate
[1:47:26] works i mean i rest after his works
[1:47:33] so his his thoughts
[1:47:36] was not to just take one day special and
[1:47:39] maybe one day holy and and you know and
[1:47:42] and and become a hypocrite on one day
[1:47:48] but his thoughts
[1:47:50] was to bring
[1:47:52] an inner confidence
[1:47:57] that would become
[1:47:59] a rest
[1:48:02] that no matter how much money you have
[1:48:05] in the bank
[1:48:07] no matter what your job title is
[1:48:12] no matter if your house
[1:48:14] your bill is due
[1:48:17] when that rest is inside
[1:48:22] your mind might be in trouble
[1:48:24] because of how your body feels under the
[1:48:26] symptoms
[1:48:28] but there is just such a confidence that
[1:48:30] is down resting in your heart
[1:48:33] you know that god is in control
[1:48:36] i don't know how
[1:48:37] but i know he's in control
[1:48:43] praise the lord
[1:48:46] that's the reason why you will see the
[1:48:48] old testament statues and ordinance
[1:48:52] taking different approach in the new
[1:48:54] testament
[1:48:59] poor pharisees of pharisees would take
[1:49:03] the old testament sabbath and teach it
[1:49:05] in the book of of of hebrew
[1:49:09] and said there is a rest unto the people
[1:49:11] of god
[1:49:14] trying to show that all the sprinkling
[1:49:18] of of bloods on the on the tabernacle
[1:49:21] and all the sprinkling and all those
[1:49:23] things that was that were done in the
[1:49:25] old testament tabernacle
[1:49:27] paul will take that and give a spiritual
[1:49:30] meaning to it
[1:49:35] the high priest that will go behind the
[1:49:38] veil
[1:49:41] because he understands
[1:49:44] that god lay out all of those statues
[1:49:48] and ordinances
[1:49:50] expressing what was in his mind
[1:49:56] praise the lord
[1:50:08] amen
[1:50:13] you know as i thought i i talked about
[1:50:15] that
[1:50:17] i taught also
[1:50:19] on the subject
[1:50:21] of the
[1:50:22] testament and the testator
[1:50:27] praise the lord
[1:50:29] amen
[1:50:31] because you cannot have a testament
[1:50:34] until the testator
[1:50:39] is dead
[1:50:42] praise the lord
[1:50:44] amen
[1:50:45] now you see that's the reason why
[1:50:48] scholars come up with the old testament
[1:50:53] because they found that what the old
[1:50:56] testament was talking about is fulfilled
[1:50:58] in christ
[1:51:01] and his death
[1:51:03] fulfill
[1:51:05] the old testament so now they can have a
[1:51:08] testament because they tested or die
[1:51:13] praise the lord
[1:51:15] but the problem there is that we have a
[1:51:17] new testament
[1:51:23] amen we have a new testament and then
[1:51:27] how can we have a new testament we have
[1:51:29] to have another testator that has died
[1:51:32] and paul said you are a written episode
[1:51:35] read by all men you become the you
[1:51:37] become a new testament when you have
[1:51:40] died to yourself for the word of god to
[1:51:43] be revealed in you
[1:51:45] that's why the living word it's more in
[1:51:48] new testament than just a pocket bible
[1:51:54] because you cannot have a testament
[1:51:56] until the testitude is that is dead
[1:52:02] we could have an old testament because
[1:52:04] christ died but why should we have a new
[1:52:06] testament
[1:52:08] when we have not had a death
[1:52:14] but yeah we have a death paul said is no
[1:52:16] longer i don't leave it
[1:52:18] but christ now leave it in me
[1:52:23] praise the lord
[1:52:26] are we together
[1:52:31] so we will appreciate the subject of the
[1:52:33] breath right
[1:52:34] by the grace of god we look we look more
[1:52:36] into it on sunday
[1:52:38] and i'll try to bring
[1:52:39] uh a few scriptures
[1:52:41] there
[1:52:43] there there are there are things that
[1:52:44] are tied to to the breath rights
[1:52:47] benefits you know enjoy like like uh you
[1:52:50] know the
[1:52:52] the let's let's take one scripture here
[1:52:56] praise the lord let's take one and we
[1:52:58] can close on that tonight
[1:53:04] you love the lord tonight
[1:53:06] i mean that's that's what matters is
[1:53:09] falling in love with jesus
[1:53:12] he says if i be lifted up
[1:53:14] i will draw all men
[1:53:17] onto me
[1:53:19] to be called equal with jesus is to
[1:53:21] leave him up
[1:53:22] is to praise him
[1:53:24] because the more you praise him he's
[1:53:26] lifting you up
[1:53:27] amen
[1:53:29] so we want to live jesus
[1:53:31] glory be to god
[1:53:34] first chronicle
[1:53:36] chapter 5.
[1:53:52] i might need my baby to come and help me
[1:53:54] find chronicles
[1:54:01] praise the lord
[1:54:04] first chronicle chapter 5.
[1:54:15] verse one
[1:54:33] we'll pick up this on the on sunday if
[1:54:35] the lord help us we'll get back to this
[1:54:37] but i just want to show something here
[1:54:39] now the sons of ruben
[1:54:41] the firstborn of israel
[1:54:45] for he was the firstborn
[1:54:49] but
[1:54:50] for as much as
[1:54:52] he defied his father dead the breath
[1:54:55] right
[1:54:56] was giving if he was giving which means
[1:54:58] it was taken
[1:55:03] it was taken from him and he was giving
[1:55:06] it was giving unto the sons of joseph
[1:55:11] the son of israel
[1:55:15] but the genealogy is not to be reckoned
[1:55:19] after the birthright
[1:55:21] which means you can never change the
[1:55:23] fact that he was the first
[1:55:25] born
[1:55:26] sure
[1:55:28] right
[1:55:29] praise the lord you you cannot you you
[1:55:31] cannot you cannot spiritualize it
[1:55:35] enjoying the benefit of the breath right
[1:55:38] cannot spiritual you there are certain
[1:55:41] things you cannot spiritualize
[1:55:44] sure
[1:55:46] praise the lord
[1:55:48] it's it's almost like uh uh you know
[1:55:51] years back uh uh uh
[1:55:54] uh you know that there's this this
[1:55:56] subject you know
[1:55:58] uh i mean you know uh adam was the first
[1:56:01] he was the first adam adam was the first
[1:56:04] adam
[1:56:05] does that sound funny
[1:56:10] praise the lord
[1:56:11] christ is the second adam
[1:56:14] amen
[1:56:16] and and and and for some reason
[1:56:20] you know
[1:56:21] people thought that
[1:56:23] there should be a a tear at them and
[1:56:26] what you would try to do there is that
[1:56:28] you you will try to spiritualize
[1:56:31] something that is not in god's word
[1:56:36] because that time is only meant for a
[1:56:39] first and a second
[1:56:43] praise the lord
[1:56:45] amen
[1:56:47] just like that a a first eve and a
[1:56:50] second eve there are some types that are
[1:56:53] just meant for that for you to try to
[1:56:56] roll it over and create another one of
[1:56:59] it you are just trying to spiritualize
[1:57:01] something that do not exist it's almost
[1:57:04] like trying to make joseph the firstborn
[1:57:09] why because he went to egypt you know
[1:57:12] what he uh he he was a son of prosperity
[1:57:15] so actually he's the firstborn because
[1:57:17] he have the bread right it does not work
[1:57:19] like that
[1:57:24] amen
[1:57:26] he can lose
[1:57:27] the the right he can lose
[1:57:32] the blessing he can lose it but it will
[1:57:35] always
[1:57:36] remains the fact that he was the one
[1:57:40] that came out first
[1:57:44] praise the lord
[1:57:46] jacob waved with with the breath right
[1:57:49] and with the blessing he met the angel
[1:57:51] and everything
[1:57:53] why was he seeking to reconcile with his
[1:57:55] brother
[1:57:58] or he could have just become spiritual
[1:58:00] life the angel has met me he changed my
[1:58:03] name i don't even care for that guy
[1:58:05] anymore i don't have to worry about oh
[1:58:07] praise the lord i mean you know i'm i'm
[1:58:09] in the rapture then you know why he
[1:58:11] could just spiritualize everything but
[1:58:14] he knew in the back of his mind
[1:58:17] the fact remains that he came out first
[1:58:22] that you cannot reverse
[1:58:25] you cannot spiritualize it
[1:58:40] praise the lord
[1:58:44] so here in this scripture
[1:58:47] and many other scripture which shows us
[1:58:49] how
[1:58:50] the birthright
[1:58:52] is tied to the firstborn
[1:58:56] praise the lord
[1:58:58] and all our rights
[1:59:01] is tied to the first born
[1:59:03] you have to find your first pawn
[1:59:06] which is christ jesus
[1:59:12] it's because of him that we have this
[1:59:14] right
[1:59:17] to the blessings of abraham
[1:59:20] it's because of him that we have the
[1:59:22] right to healing
[1:59:26] praise the lord sure
[1:59:29] you realize that
[1:59:31] i mean it's the firstborn has the right
[1:59:34] of redemption
[1:59:36] the right of redemption was given to the
[1:59:42] firstborn that's what god told the
[1:59:44] children of israel at the uh exeter
[1:59:47] exodus leviticus if you study that you
[1:59:49] realize that
[1:59:50] uh uh uh
[1:59:52] he says he says every every first born
[1:59:56] is mine
[2:00:00] then god went on he says well the
[2:00:02] levites will now take the place of the
[2:00:05] first born so what happened every first
[2:00:08] born that is born must be redeemed
[2:00:14] because now god choose the levites in
[2:00:17] the place of the firstborn
[2:00:22] what is he doing he's slowly bringing
[2:00:25] out his deep thoughts
[2:00:30] first he said the first born the first
[2:00:32] born on my eye
[2:00:35] but then as the people move on he says
[2:00:37] well okay
[2:00:38] i'm going to take the levi's in the
[2:00:40] place of the firstborn so now the
[2:00:43] levites are my firstborn
[2:00:47] praise the lord
[2:00:52] you see israel did not argue with it
[2:00:58] he did not he israel did not argue with
[2:01:01] it because from from the very father god
[2:01:04] told them that the
[2:01:06] uh the reason why i'm taking the first
[2:01:09] bone to be mine is because i i i spared
[2:01:14] the first bone and i slayed the
[2:01:16] egyptians first born
[2:01:19] this death anger was supposed to slay
[2:01:22] every firstborn but i saved the first
[2:01:25] born under the blood and i slayed the
[2:01:27] egyptian first bomb so all these first
[2:01:29] born that i saved are mine
[2:01:35] praise the lord
[2:01:36] won't you be glad to give god your
[2:01:38] firstborn
[2:01:40] if you realize that they would have died
[2:01:42] in egypt
[2:01:44] that there was no place in the house to
[2:01:46] keep your first born
[2:01:48] like him in the closet he's going to die
[2:01:50] under the bed he's going to die
[2:01:54] put the first bone on the breast to suck
[2:01:56] he's going to die
[2:01:58] won't you be glad to give god your first
[2:02:00] born
[2:02:14] musicians you can come let's stand up
[2:02:16] tonight

[2:04:14] attitude

[2:04:20] sometimes we think we know sometimes we
[2:04:22] think we have grown
[2:04:24] in the grace of god
[2:04:30] that's god's ordained way
[2:04:34] he ordained it he's the god of life
[2:04:39] and bible tells healing can only come
[2:04:42] from god
[2:04:45] and whatever that god will use he told
[2:04:48] up the prophet isaiah took a clean and
[2:04:51] and rob and go and he told hezekiah go
[2:04:54] and take some leaves and rub it in in in
[2:04:56] the clay and rub it on your bars jesus

[2:05:31] for their healing
[2:05:35] and they won't visit the doctor they
[2:05:37] won't do what the doctor says
[2:05:39] and they trusted god for their healing
[2:05:42] and god healed him in a new body
[2:05:45] through death
[2:05:48] [Music]
[2:05:55] praise the lord
[2:05:58] for some reason when i read that i fed
[2:06:00] it and that's the reason why i'm crying
[2:06:03] against it because it's a wrong attitude
[2:06:05] [Music]
[2:06:13] i would just leave it as dead i don't
[2:06:16] want to go into any other thing tonight
[2:06:22] the same god i healed by divine healing
[2:06:25] is the same god that healed by the
[2:06:27] preaching of his word
[2:06:29] is the same god i hear by the hands of
[2:06:31] the doctor
[2:06:32] praise the lord
[2:06:36] [Music]
[2:06:56] on
[2:07:01] lift me
[2:07:03] up
[2:07:04] and let me stand
[2:07:08] by fade on
[2:07:11] [Music]
[2:07:24] my
[2:07:34] and let me
[2:07:37] stand by faith
[2:07:41] [Music]
[2:07:43] oh
[2:07:48] [Music]
[2:08:10] oh
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:30] me
[2:08:35] [Music]
[2:08:42] oh
[2:08:44] [Music]
[2:08:57] yes
[2:08:58] [Music]
[2:09:26] yes i'm pressing on
[2:09:40] oh
[2:09:55] oh yes
[2:09:57] [Music]
[2:10:10] oh
[2:10:30] you see that's the reason why
[2:10:33] [Music]
[2:10:36] you're realizing the lord jesus ministry
[2:10:39] and even in the time of the great
[2:10:40] revival and even now
[2:10:43] an unbeliever
[2:10:45] with no knowledge of god
[2:10:48] maybe no desire of god
[2:10:51] he can easily
[2:10:53] be touched by the miraculous
[2:10:56] than the believer
[2:10:58] one of the reason is because
[2:11:01] that paul sinner
[2:11:03] is looking at himself now even walter of
[2:11:05] god's grace
[2:11:07] [Music]
[2:11:09] while the believer is looking at it as a
[2:11:11] right
[2:11:16] he's he's he's demanding god
[2:11:20] the lord i have trusted you all of these
[2:11:22] years you gotta you gotta do a miracle
[2:11:25] in my body lord i believe you have been
[2:11:27] holding to your word
[2:11:30] you can force god
[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:11:45] like we saw under the prophet
[2:11:48] ministry
[2:11:49] how the injured of the law will move in
[2:11:51] a meeting
[2:11:52] move in a meeting
[2:11:54] and touch sinners
[2:11:57] and heal people
[2:12:02] and all of those uh uh uh uh uh uh
[2:12:06] theologians and scala will sit on the
[2:12:08] pulpit
[2:12:09] expecting
[2:12:13] lord you know i brought my nephew to
[2:12:15] this meeting expecting you to move i
[2:12:17] know you were you would leave brother
[2:12:18] branham to i mean
[2:12:20] you don't program god like that
[2:12:24] that's not faith
[2:12:27] that's not faith it's a sense of fear
[2:12:30] you are expressing fear it's not faith
[2:12:33] if you believe that god can do a putter
[2:12:35] in his hands and leave it there
[2:12:39] most of the time we express fear
[2:12:41] and think it is faith that we have
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:48] you would just love him
[2:12:50] you would just appreciate him
[2:12:54] he would just love him
[2:12:57] because god can use a five years old to
[2:13:00] hold his mama hands and say lord
[2:13:03] please jesus
[2:13:05] lord i pray for my mama
[2:13:08] just that simple prayer the miraculous
[2:13:10] god can be so pleased
[2:13:15] because it's an innocent child
[2:13:18] all he's doing he's just saying
[2:13:20] expressing words because
[2:13:23] there's a god he's being taught about
[2:13:25] [Music]
[2:13:28] and we put god on terms and we put him
[2:13:31] and lord jesus and and we bring him to
[2:13:33] death you remember lord you and god and
[2:13:37] oh my god
[2:13:38] may god just i believe church there are
[2:13:40] higher grounds
[2:13:42] i believe that the the
[2:13:44] the message of the hour
[2:13:46] is raising the bride to a higher ground
[2:13:49] that where we can appreciate god in his
[2:13:52] love
[2:13:53] we can just love him
[2:13:59] now even though you slay me
[2:14:01] i will still love you
[2:14:06] by a believer goes through a small trial
[2:14:08] then we start to look on our calendar
[2:14:10] how long we've been serving god
[2:14:14] then we want to bring god to court
[2:14:16] [Music]
[2:14:21] but when there is no triumph we can
[2:14:23] preach those things and it's so
[2:14:24] beautiful oh praise the lord thank you
[2:14:26] jesus oh praise the lord let god just
[2:14:29] put us through a little bit
[2:14:31] [Music]
