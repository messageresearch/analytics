blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord most times blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord [Music] amen amen [Applause] we're so thankful for that name this morning the name of the lord the strong tower one that we can we can cry out we can breathe in prayer we can just whisper it we can think it jesus he said if if you'll just mention my name even in prayer i'll come on by so if if we've been crying out and reaching out and praying in his name already we know he's here he's with us he's here in this place his presence is here with us he's standing here by each one of us he's ready to meet your need you see we've we've come here gathered together because it's something he placed in his word he said gather together because this this is a way you'll draw strength one from another he said that's what the body's for but we're not drawing each other's strength we're not drawing from some power personally that each one of us has it's not our human ability it's not our intellect it's not our our uh emotional strength [Music] that we're drawing from each other but each one of us has brought that name with us each one of us has brought that lick of fire along with us and as those licks of fire come together it's like a fire that's been scattered abroad the little twigs are a piece of wood here and there that's got a flame on their own they they'll burn but as you bring them together the the intensity multiplies it doesn't just stay little licks of fire on the ground but he turned turns into a bonfire a raging flame and that's how we draw strength because maybe there's one or two of you your fire was maybe almost out maybe there's just a few embers or maybe you're just a fresh piece of wood here this morning as you get laid into that bonfire with all the flames that's already glowing it's no power of the wood it's the power of the fire it can light your life here this morning and you can walk out of here on fire too and we're so thankful for that that's yes i'm i get nervous and then i just start talking and i'll i'll wander around so musicians thank you so much i appreciate it i just have a little thought nothing nothing real new this morning um just something hopefully that will encourage your heart something that you'll be able to take along down the road let's just let's go ahead and turn in our scripture to isaiah 29 and 13. and it says wherefore the lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips to honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precepts of men and we're going to jump over to matthew chapter 15. and verses eight through nine actually start with verse seven ye hypocrites well did essays prophesy of you saying this people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men let's pray heavenly father lord we just come before you once again this morning father just so thankful to be here before you father lord i just ask that you just come on down and have your way this morning father to set me to the side father lord lord speak to your people father lord may i just be a instrument in your hand father lord it or if there's something you can use from these thoughts these little things perhaps i've studied on tonight surrender them to you father and lord if you have something else then i surrender myself to you as well or just ask you to bless your people lord and have your way in this service we pray in jesus name amen you may be seated i want to take a thought here and speak on converting the heart of man to the heart of god you know i've been thinking on this you know last service brother one spoke on he touched on this and and saying how sometimes when we think a certain way or we see something a certain way it's because of how we've been taught or our religious um view on it and really when god's looking to do a whole another thing you know and that's the place that the people found themselves in both instances here and we find out that it's not something new this goes all the way back to genesis with cain and abel you see one had a revelation of what god wanted him to do and the other one was trying to work something up so that he felt like he had some part in it so he could claim it for his own in a way that he felt then god owed it to him because it has not because god's word wasn't there it wasn't because they weren't reading the same scripture it wasn't because they didn't have the same pastor all the way back to cain and abel they had they had adam himself the man who had heard it from god's own lips lips to ear to teach them and preach to them the same word the exact same word same thing in isaiah they all had the old testament prophets they all had the books of moses they all had to memorize most of them from the time they were a child even if they couldn't read in the synagogue it was taught to them so thoroughly that they could recite it to you word for word for word for word same thing we come up here into the book of matthew and jesus is repeating them back the same thing he said you guys are still stuck in this same rut he said the word of god is here it's it's playing out before your very eyes but because it doesn't match what you think it should it's not good enough for you you see because in the book of moses moses gave them ten commandments and within those ten commandments there was about i think i i just with a really little bit of research there was about 631 rules or explanations to those commandments that was god speaking to moses giving his people direct instruction on how to live on how to obey the word how to live according to the word that was god's direct instruction and yet from the time of moses to the time of jesus they wrote a whole another list and books of instruction to interpret those laws interpret those commandments to make them work for them you see it's the same nicolaitan spirit you say when did that nicoletan spirit start to ride and it it started the ride the same time as when christ came on the scene because we know there's always twins in the scripture so if we see god moving we know on the other side it's moving it's rising up to me that we think the nickelodeon spirit didn't start all the way up until while there was no roman catholic church that rome wasn't involved yet but it started way back here it's it's riding and moving right there and it says they draw ninety with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men and you'll see this continuously throughout history is that the church has a knowledge of the word but does not believe it now we need to define the word believe we need to because believe is used very loosely in the english language very loosely if someone tells you like yeah i believe you and you're like no i don't or someone will tell you something you're like yeah i believe that i think that's true and you go and you do completely the opposite thing you don't believe it you've acquired additional knowledge that you're weighing on on how much of it is true but you don't believe it so you have a knowledge of it but not a belief you see because knowledge puff us up right and and in pride you will rise up and say i know better or you say it needs something more it's not enough that's that's good but it's not enough but when you say i believe then that's it it's finished and in the hebrew the term to believe was the word amman a-m-a-n which also interprets to the word faith faith and belief are interchangeably used back to that same hebrew root to have faith is to believe in order to believe you must have faith because the belief has to become an absolute and if it's an absolute you don't need to redefine it you don't need to add to it you don't need to figure it out you don't need to create some type of action to bring it to pass you just have to believe it you have to have faith that it is that he is but if all you have is a knowledge then we find ourself in the same place that the children of israel did continuously throughout their seven church ages and josh i'm actually gonna have you jump in there for me i thought i was gonna be fancy today but i'm too nervous i'm gonna just mix it all up if we go to acts uh chapter 13 20 through 23 and it says and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of 450 years until samuel the prophet and afterward they desired a king and god gave unto them saul the son of sis a man of the tribe of benjamin for the space of forty years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will of this man's seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a savior jesus now you see there's three stages in here that the children of israel went through the first one was judges and prophets now everybody comes under this it doesn't matter if you're a christian doesn't matter if you're religious it doesn't matter who you are but there are god in scripture it says that there's rules and there is a law within a man that he knows right from wrong we all know don't steal you shouldn't lie the basics so there's a law within a man that's the judges because the law in and of itself can't save you it never was meant to do that the law paul told us in the book of romans he said the law all it did was bring me to a realization of my sin and bring forth the fruits of death because there was no coming back from it so here we are in the stage of judges it doesn't matter who everybody is under this stage of judges of the law whether you like it or not you can't escape it if you go to romans chapter 7 verse 1. josh if you put that up know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth so the moment you're born to the day you die whether you know the law don't know the law it has control over you you know they say they say ignorance is no excuse well i didn't know it doesn't matter it'll take you to prison the same way ignorance is no excuse and that's where we all start out at and then as we as we move along in our in our life or as god is moving on us and you know we he he began to tug and pull on our heart whether we're out in the world we're out in denomination or we'll grow up right here in the pews and the benches of this message you know we get a little religious right we begin to learn the law we learn this and that but but we want to do it our way and that's where the children of israel went to next and afterward they desired a king and god gave them to them saul the son of sis a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of forty years this was a man after the heart of the people he looked good he acted good he spoke well he was charismatic he knew all the right things to say he could say it well you like being around him he made you feel good but there was no depth there was no holding power when it came down to it like every religious organization when when that man was put into power the power went to his head [Music] and from there he became corrupted he started out right he wanted to do the right thing brother branham says many times he said that that nun she didn't join the catholic church to be a bad person she did it to serve god you know many many people you know we especially today in this age we look around we see people falling by the wayside all over the place whether it's friends people we knew uh ministers that were were pillars in this message falling to the wayside and you go wow how did that happen they seemed to be seemed like nothing ever shook them seemed like they were so on fire all the time they made it this far they made it this far but when the time of shaking came they found all they had was knowledge they had a lot of knowledge and and with their processing power they could reason it themself into believing it and because they are doing it then they're going to go out and convince as many people as they can that it's the truth and it looks like the real thing it looks identical but when when when the rubber meets the road as they say the tires fell off because there was no holding power because it was all of their own reasoning they'd reason themselves out of it and no matter how long it took somebody then reasoned them out of it maybe they reasoned themselves out of it and now i have found david the son of jesse and when he had removed him now this is important you see and it says and when he had removed him who is that he the people didn't remove saul as being king this is going to be this is very key because this is the difference between works and faith is that even as we move into faith we still think there's something we can do to help it still think well maybe if i just do this or if i just do that or if i just stop doing this or if i can stop doing this then i can have the faith for this other as long as you put a contingency on faith that is contingent upon your own human ability of any kind it'll never work it'll always fall short because you know they say that the destruct a chain's strongest is only strongest at its weakest link so it doesn't matter how much of god's perfect faith you put on either side of it i mean you insert a human link in the middle and you give a little tug shatters pulls apart and then you're going what happened i thought i did the right thing i was praying and i was doing this and i was doing that and i was i was doing this other and i was trying my best to live right and i was i was checking all the boxes see the problem is is you tried to check boxes and then put faith on the bottom you try to put your belief under that well if i can check all these boxes off then then once i know i can do that then i know i can have faith you see you're still trying to work something out you know you think you're not because you're not you're not in some dark room with a whip and and praying and beating yourself thinking that somehow that'll bring god pleasure or somehow pleasing and seeing how you're suffering you see that's where the the denominations and the church got it wrong and even the jewish church is they assumed that god took pleasure in their suffering somehow that that was some benefit to god and so if they did enough of it then god would hear their prayers but that's the same spirit of baal because remember that time when elisha was there with the 400 prophets of baal you see god told him bring the sacrifice bring the stones bring the water dig the ditch get ready prepare yourself to meet with me and once he did all of that he just stepped back and said lord i'm yours i've done all that you've requested now i'm done and the prophets of baal they had everything that he had they had the sacrifice they had the stones they had the altar i don't think they poured any water on their sacrifice because their belief level was much less and their god didn't answer and immediately you see what they go into is they begin beating themselves and whipping themselves it's a pagan thing it is a thing that goes it's of the devil all the way back from the beginning is the mutilation of the people thinking that it will bring god some type of of glory to tear themselves down to destroy themselves and i should just let them run around and run around until they were worn out they had run themselves out of works right that was the extreme but that's the same thing you're doing every time that you think that you can work your way into salvation you're just running around in a circle and and you're you're not even reaching out to god because he never asked that of you he doesn't even know what you're doing he's watching you just run around in circles and do all these works and and well if i do this i know scripture says if i put god first then he'll do this for me you see that's backwards already is he said put me first and all these things will be added unto you but your thinking isn't on christ your thinking is on the reward and the minute you put the reward first you're already backwards you're already backwards you see is creating some type of contingency plan around faith is not faith and that's what you're doing you're like okay so if i help the church here and i real supportive over here and i go help this other person um with their yard or i help them in some financial way or if i'm if i pray more then god will bless me well even in that all of those things have now become works because you've got the cart before the horse as they say is you're putting all the things that should be pulled by the power of the horse in front of the horse and your cart's not going nowhere all right and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will now here it is the people have had judges they've had prophets they've had their own king they've had it their way and their own king has brought them to a point where they're in chaos it looked good starting out and now he's running around destroying the church you know i i personally can give testimony to that's how these churches work i grew up in a place that was just like that it looked great it looked perfect the people who started it they were there for they were all there for the right reason but their focus came off of christ and little by lit little it went from christ to the pastor and the pastor became the absolute of the church and instead of remaining humble and pointing the people to christ the power the prestige the money that came along with it took over because there was a knowledge of the truth but not a belief you see and as it begins going that way because they don't believe then they don't believe anyone else believes and because what they thought they believed wasn't good enough for them you see because they're still struggling with all these things in their past they're even struggling as as as you know like saul here it didn't happen overnight he didn't go from being anointed king to the next day killing the prophets of the lord it was a period it was a time different things began to happen where he felt rejected like he felt spurned like if i can't be number one all the time it's not good enough it's like samuel told him they were going to battle and tanya told him come to this certain location and we're gonna before battle we're going to present a sacrifice unto the lord and saul gathered the people he got to the right location he got to church and he had the right sacrifice he was ready he was antsy he was ready to go and samuel didn't show up on his schedule he didn't show up he waited and he waited and saul said we can't wait no more if we wait any longer the enemy will get away you see there it is doubt samuel already told him we're going to go we're going to fight we're gonna we're gonna go before the lord for victory and battle and then we're going to war and we will win but he didn't believe that was true if it didn't happen fast enough for him there was doubt there he said i have to do this myself or else it's not going to work and he did he went and he out of his position went to present the sacrifice and moments after he finished samuel shows up now you say wow god must have really done a number and and they still won but god wasn't pleased it was from that time forward that he began working with samuel and he said we're going to find someone else other than this man but you know he was in power for years and years after that to the people it looked like god was still blessing him tremendously financially in battle next thing happens is god begins moving on a young man's heart that he's moving on the scene for because he's going to be the one god's going to use to save his people and that young man gets moved into a position right next to saul and saul doesn't even realize it saul as a person doesn't realize it but that spirit that's already afflicted him does it's a jealous spirit it's an impatient spirit and now it begins to work on him and work on him and it's happening so slowly that the people of the congregation the men of his military might the men and generals of his army that are standing close next to him they don't even know he's changing all they know is wow look at saul man what a great king remember remember what it was like when we only had judges and we always the people around us always pushed us around wow not with saul here he's the best but it's the same nicolette in spirit it's taking over and it's kind of like you know the term they say those who have been abused are most likely to abuse and that's where many of us need to check ourselves and say lord deliver me because we we run from the grips of slavery to run and enslave somebody else because we're still under this saul influence we're still under the influence of the law we think we're so revelated but we do the same thing like the man who was forgiven 500 talents and he walks straight out of there feeling great and finds the man who owns him owes him 50 and throws him in jail how often do we do the same to brothers and sisters in christ and i'm not talking about a monetary value but we are forgiven so much we are forgiven all not just all in your past but all in your past all in your current all in your future it's forgiven if you believe it and then we turn around as soon as we we feel a little bit better about ourselves just like him that the relief of the debt was off of him all right oh my goodness look at what that guy's doing man and he calls himself a christian in a moment like we step out the door right out the door we've just been in a service where god's been moving on your heart and you were you had felt condemned coming in because we're human we're people paul said he said that which i would not that i do and that which i would i do not he said in this body of flesh i'm going to fight it till the very end so yeah if the if the holy spirit is moving in your life and you do something you shouldn't you're going to feel condemned now he's not going to keep you there see that's going to be a major difference between these two places where this under the the influence of of the king the ma men the people chose the people's men versus god's men teaching and knowledge of man versus teaching and revelation of the holy spirit a key thing you're going to find is that one forgives and the other one is looking for someone else to blame you know growing up i was born and raised in in the church for until i was 18 years old and i didn't even think about it but you know any time someone was going through some kind of a trial that was well known or the pastor himself was going through some kind of a trial someone became really sick in the church whatever it was it would instantly go from a message of we all are the only ones we're the only ones making it we're the only church you all are are the bride and the next second ain't none of you got the holy ghost like figure that out but it's the same nicolaitan spirit it was playing all the way back here it keeps moving forward now you see it in in the matthew in jesus time where they asked him you know lord this man he's born blind was that for some sin he he he was committed or a sin of his parents or maybe his grandparents we have to lay the blame to somebody someone is at fault and jesus said no no no nobody's at fault you guys calm down it's simply so that i i the god of glory can show my glory that's it that's it that trial going through that thing you're struggling with that sickness you're going through it ain't nobody's fault we don't need to find the scapegoat to pin it to there already was a scapegoat back at calvary he took it all upon himself you see but if we find ourselves in a place where we're lacking in the right revelation of the word right oh many of us speaking from personal experience raised up in the message went to sunday school from the time i was four or five years old you know by it by the last you the last sunday school um when you're you it was like eight or 12 to 13 the last year there they had a brother there who would take you through the seven church ages and the seven seals bit by bit and walk you through the scriptures so you know it you can quote it if you can recall it to memory like that knowledge knowledge knowledge is a dangerous thing now don't take me wrong i'm not saying don't study by all means get in the word study you're meant to do that but it's meant to be combined with the teaching of the holy spirit not with the fear of man you see that was the struggle here both in isaiah and matthew he says their fear toward me towards who god himself the teachers were teaching the people of fear towards god but not in the way that he he he listed later it's not the fear of the lord a fear out of respect a respect of that holy presence that just comes down and you feel it and that awesome fear brother branham talks about it he said you just can't stand in it he said not that kind of fear but it's the fear of a judgment a fear of the man in the sky with a hammer who you have to please why why do they teach it that way because if they can convince you that's what god is then they can rule over you the same way a teaching of fear is used to control the people not bring them closer to god their fear toward me is taught by the precepts of men now precepts of men and in matthew it says for doctrines the commandments of men they're using the same bible they are quoting the same prophets they were coding moses scripture tells us that while he was hanging on the cross they are quoting the psalm about the crucifixion knowledge no revelation hmm i swear a little a note here something to keep in mind religion puts greater emphasis on the keeping of rules and appearance than the saving of souls and getting people to christ you know any one view to this day although it's become much more closed off if you were to walk into the church that i grew up in being 30 minutes early as taught by the prophet to come and prepare yourself before service to be 30 minutes early was to be late the music was playing just perfectly way before service everyone would walk in quietly and sit in their place you'd go to your place and then from the smallest children to the oldest adult as they came into service one at a time or as they came trickling into the building become their place set themselves down get up go down to the altar for a time of prayer come back up now if you see me around here now typically i i'm i'm quite a bit more casual typically but being casual on a wednesday night meant that you were at least wearing a shirt and tie the comments which i didn't even think about it back then but the comments that we would get from other people who would come and visit on a sunday right was it look like everyone was going to the prom i know of a young man who showed up without his suit coat on on a sunday and they sent him home to get it yeah but the worship it was perfect the the pianist and the organists and the and the the music and the band and they would all play together and in prior to the service starting and come up and just everyone would just everyone together as one enter into worship and singing you wouldn't hardly see a person not not if they were clapping everyone was clapping if they were singing everyone was singing right church order looks perfect catholic church got it down to a t you come in you're quiet you're reverent brother branham even said you pentecostals could learn a few things from them guess we're all awake now but but they had their church order down exactly just like the sadducees and pharisees and the priests of jesus time every robe was exact every little tassel was in place when you walked you walked a certain way when you came into the temple you you came in a certain direction everything was exact exact jesus said except your righteousness be greater than that of the righteousness of the sadducees and pharisees he said you don't even have a chance to enter the kingdom of heaven and they and the disciples said how is anyone going to manage that i can't even manage to live as well as they do he said you cannot put a single dot to their lives when you if you'd put them under a microscope and examine how they live by way of works you won't find a thing they have it exact and jesus said lest your righteousness is greater than that you don't even have a chance and the disciples are still thinking with that old mentality the works mentality they're like wow if that's the level i got to go to i'm not going to make it not because i don't want to but i know myself way too well i'm not going to make it but jesus was not talking about your own righteousness you see he was working them out of that he was getting them out because it wasn't going to be another saul it was not going to be another man's leadership or man's counsel or man's commandments but he was calling them up because it was going to be he himself it wasn't going to be your righteousness it was going to be his righteousness it wasn't going to be your works it was going to be his works why because you're going to be living by faith and what faith the faith of the son of man you see we think well i have faith for that or i have faith for this or i my faith it's not that's not really true he the lord allows us to say those things but it's his faith you don't have any faith outside of his faith you're not able to believe outside of what he's revealed to you so you have a revelation that he's given you you have a faith to believe that revelation that he's given you you see this is why there's such a difference between those who have knowledge and those who it's revealed to those who believe not just those who have knowledge because when you begin to realize the difference you see whenever you have a lot of knowledge let's say you're a doctor or you're a lawyer or whatever it is you're the specialist in what you do right and you have studied and you have worked and you have gone under apprenticeship you've gone through internship you have gone through whatever you need to do to be the top of your field when someone comes and says anything contrary to what you know and you know that they they don't have any qualifications they read something on google right on something that takes a lifetime to master but at least years and years to know enough to even be able to discern between what is one thing and another it becomes a personal affront to you look at all the work i put into this and you're trying to tell me that i don't know what i'm talking about how dare you right and that's the place of works in religion is do you know how long i've been in this message do you know how many messages i've heard do you know how many messages i've read do you know how many messages how many quotes i have memorized do you know how much of the scripture i can quote to you by memory me not hardly any i have a horrible memory so that that's something i had a struggle with but when it's that and someone dares to contradict it what you think and what you think you know it's now personal between me and you i'm going to get you i'm going to prove to you one way or the other and the catholic church did just that all through the inquisition if i can't convince you with words i'll beat it out of you because if i lose i lose everything and i don't have that much confidence in what i know you see that's why we should never ever be afraid to have our faith challenged don't fear it don't fear it you know the only reason why you fear or someone would fear to have their faith challenged they're not sure what they really believe they're standing in a place of knowledge but they're not sure themselves and so imagine this you're in the middle of a storm and you're on an island it's a very small island and you're balanced on what you believe is the only firm ground that's keeping you out of the rushing water and someone else starts taking pot shots at the ground underneath your firm ground now if you know that's a granite fortress of a rock you're not worried about what they throw at it you'll stand there you'll lay there you'll sleep there you'll dance there it doesn't matter it's like the rock of gibraltar you know that the amount of force it would take to dislodge you is impossible so you're unconcerned but if you think that the top that you're standing on is just a thin amount of rock and everything under that is sand every time anybody throws anything at the base you're going to be really upset and you know why you're upset because you are really afraid there's no need to be afraid if you believe so the only thing that challenging your faith does is it shakes you up a bit it shakes you up just like a tree with the wind blowing through its branches it'll figure out what your roots are made out of is it made out of knowledge because so you have reason to be afraid because knowledge is just a whole lot of reasoning and if it's just reasoning someone will reason better than you there's someone smarter than you that'll reason you in a circle so big that you can't find the other end and you'll just go into a tailspin and away you'll be and gone but if you have a revelation that's true then all it's going to do is the wind blows through your branches it's going to shake it's going to the tree is going to bend a little bit back and forth it's going to flex with the wind and it's going to take and all the way down the ground it's going to loosen things up and all those roots are going to kind of pull in the earth you know all that does it just makes it easier for them to grow again next time they just reach out further why because it loosens the ground around them and they just reach out further and further and dig in deeper and that's what we want we want people to challenge our faith we want to be challenged in a way that shakes us up from what we're just hanging around in you want someone to ask us a question we don't know the answer to why because we know the one who has the answers and sometimes when we're just drifting along and we're happy with where we're at in life and we're happy with the way the lord is blessing us and you know we get complacent and we need a little bit of wind to shake us up why then remember oh yeah i should be reading my bible more often wow and someone will ask you a question you're like wow i never even thought about that but tell you what give me a little bit of time and i'll get you an answer i'm going to go back to the one who has the answers and ask him and he'll tell me because he said in the scripture that he would send the comforter who would teach us all things didn't say you would know all things at once he said he's going to teach you all things but like any good professor he's going to you're going to be learning the main part of the curriculum and it's the students that take a deeper interest that he'll take to the side and explain it to you that's all he's waiting for you to do is you come here every service you know you get the base curriculum don't for a minute think that this is all you need this is just meant to be another part of the shake you up a little bit taken and and maybe something that you've never heard before you never heard it that way before will come and at you and you go huh never heard that before now i tell you this don't just take it for gospel truth don't do it even if it is right the prophet told us not to do that and that was with him ministering with thus saith the lord he said you owe it to yourself to go back to the scriptures and ask the lord to reveal it to you because if all you do is receive it here and go yeah well brother so-and-so is the one who said it must be true you got a nugget of knowledge but until it becomes a revelation it's not going to take hold you see because the word to believe let's jump back to that real quick same as as faith amman which is where we get the word amen which belief and faith are always coincide with an action you see that's the other difference between knowledge and belief is that the hebrew word was so deep in meaning is to know something may not change anything for you we could find something out about a country halfway around the world how they're starving to death and we're all going to lunch to this evening we're not even going to think about it we're not even going to pause like we'll feel bad for a moment but because it's so far away and most of us have never experienced that we'll feel bad oh that's we'll pray for them and we'll pray for them as we pray for our lunch so we have a knowledge but the likelihood that you're going to look into ways to send aid and you're going to look into ways to be of help to that problem halfway around the world pretty slim i would imagine for most of us there's just too many problems in the world knowledge but belief is different belief is something to say you believe will always bring about an action a belief will always cause a change in your life it is actionable and it takes effect it has fruit that's why here in isaiah nope hold on it bringeth forth fruit oh yeah if we can go back to romans 7. you bring that up for me verse five for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work on our members to bring forth fruit unto death okay so no matter which one that you're partaking of you could be partaking of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you see the problem with the tree wasn't that it was all evil it was just knowledge it was just knowledge of good and evil it was both it was information it's what we have today you know that's what daniel said in the book of daniel there uh they think it was daniel 12 chapter 12 verse 4. it said that knowledge would be increased and many would run to and fro more knowledge more confusion but the fruit of revelation is not the same it's a fruit of life josh if you have a spoken word as the original seed if you're going off the power point it's slide 14 and it says a seed must have water to grow now you put a seed in the ground if there's no moisture in the ground it's dust and it won't grow in the dust can't it got to have a certain percent of moisture or won't grow that's right the letter killeth the spirit giveth it life and jumping down um in paragraph 116 without the water when the he first con when he's first converted he looks right straight to christ he believes and the first thing you know that denomination binds him up into a place and the moisture the spirit is god gone from him he becomes denominational and he's dead you see the word is correct the letter of the word is correct and it's good and it's true but without a revelation it just brings death it brings more death you see because as we begin to understand or begin to read and acquire knowledge then the devil uses that against us he does the same thing as he did with christ and he came to him there in the desert and he began quoting the scripture you see the difference there is christ had a revelation of who he was and he could quote not just quote the scripture back but it was the scripture that was applicable to himself like in there when he said he took him to the says he took him to the pinnacle of the temple and he quoted him the scripture and he said it says that if you were to cast yourself down you would not even stub your toe upon a stone and that's paraphrasing so don't look for that in the king james and jesus said it also is written thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god now when you first read that you think jesus is referring and said i am not going to tempt god by throwing myself down but when you read it and you get into the message you realize he was telling satan you should not tempt god he said because i am the embodiment of god in flesh you will reap from this you see that's the difference between knowledge and a revelation one we look at it we go like oh yeah i shouldn't tempt god so wow i've been that lustful spirit i've been dealing with that i better not do that because it'll tempt god this other thing that i've been doing this music i've been listening to i better not listen to it because it's gonna tempt god this whatever the action is insert whatever it is that you struggle with i better not do that because it'll tempt god but jesus knew who he was and he spoke to the devil he spoke to that problem and said how dare you tempt me scripture specifically tells you not to because i identify with the father amen you see and that's where many of us find ourselves and we don't think about it but we're still trying to perform some type of work to deliver ourself from that thing that we're struggling with or your pride your anger whatever it is and wow if i can just you know these 12 steps to not being angry 12 steps to not being an alcoholic we know all those programs including alcoholics and anonymous when you get to the very end of your program you say you start out with i am an alcoholic and you end with i am an alcoholic you've not been delivered you've just learned steps that maybe will help you avoid it and we think that we can approach god in that way if we just apply these 12 steps to getting rid of my problem then i can have a closer walk with god and god is saying just come have a closer walk with me and you won't have to worry about it you know i think even many times that's what we do is maybe we're trying to counsel someone or give someone advice and what do i what do i do about this and well have you tried this and have you tried that and well maybe just don't hang out with those people and don't don't keep don't keep those types of things around you and i'm not saying that's bad advice but i know from personal experience one minute you're heavily convicted and you take whatever it is and you destroy it or you throw it away or you get rid of it or you you say i'm never going to do that again i feel better all right i'm ready to go to church now i can stand up tall and and know i'm i'm here and i can be accepted and i belong here because i'm doing the right thing and you do and then a few days later a week later a month later you go back and you rebuy it you re-hang out with those people you you go right back why because the desire was never taken from you and you cannot deliver yourself of a desire that was the problem with the children of israel wandering around the wilderness dealing with works i bring my my lamb i bring my dove i offer it up i feel better they tell me go sin no more i walk away i feel good about myself and i still have the same desire and i go do the same thing and then the next day i come back i present the same sacrifice and i do it all over again and over again and over again and over again and then we start looking for fault and then we start even within ourselves wow maybe i'm maybe i'm just not a son a god hey i'm not maybe maybe i don't belong here look at this i keep trying and trying and trying and trying and it doesn't work well stop trying stop trying that's your problem your problem is you're trying he never wanted you to do that he said lay your burdens on me he didn't say keep carrying your burden how many of you have read pilgrim's progress a few maybe maybe you know the story basically right the man he's he he has a heavy load of sin and it's in the shape of a heavy burden on his back right and he tries all these things to get rid of it and in the end you know how he got rid of it he walked to the foot of the cross and kneeled at the foot of the cross and as he kneeled at the foot of the cross the burden rolled away he didn't take it off he didn't lay it down it rolled away you see but as long as you're trying to remove it it'll stay there it'll stay there it may be reduced it may be smaller because that's why when all right i'm watching the clock here so i'm gonna give myself about five to ten minutes and try and wrap it up but that's why when they brought the woman accused of adultery before jesus they said we got this guy now here he is he's he he always tries to play mr nice guy forgive everyone's sin and all this stuff and we haven't been able to pin it on him yet but we caught this like you know that blind man we're pretty sure him and his or his parents sinned but we can't prove it and the woman and the man who was who came down through the roof and was it was lame and he he healed him and he said go and sin no more we know that guys sinned a lot but we can't prove nothing but this one we caught our sinning now let's see him get out of this right they had a lot of knowledge all together they were really smart real smart like i wouldn't have a chance and here they go they bring them and they throw her down before jesus and say jesus all right we got one for you this time you can't get out you're not going to get out of this you're not going to be able to play mr nice guy and still stay within the law what they didn't know was he was the law that was the difference they had a knowledge of the law but he was the embodiment of the law and he knew it better than any of them could and he doesn't say anything to them he doesn't even say anything to the woman he bends over and he begins riding in the dust we don't know what he wrote what we do know is it says from the oldest to the youngest they walked away why because even those pharisees and sadducees who thought their lives were so perfect they had they had it down to every knot every little line everything but when when he began to write out the revelation of the very laws and commandments that they thought they knew so well in detail one by one he doesn't even have to write their sins personal their own knowledge caught them because they remembered he who is guilty of the least of these is guilty of them all so in order to have him judge her the woman they brought before him they had come and presented them themselves all for judgment because no flesh can stand in the presence of a holy god you see and that's where we stand as well be careful that we don't now i don't say you don't call out sin that's not it calm down it's going to be okay but what i mean is is jesus was able to look at each and every one no matter how old they were how well known they were in the church from the the pastor the high priest down to the person who who swept the street and not one of them got away each one of them had something they were still dealing with in their life and by knowledge they knew they were all guilty of death of stoning just like that woman they'd cast before him death was the only answer by way of the law and they were all guilty and since it's hard to throw stones at yourself they dropped them and walked away and jesus response was woman where art thine accusers you know she wasn't even aware of what was going on around her the commandments of men were holding her in so much fear she just was waiting for the first stone to strike her it was the inevitable she saw no way out and since each one left one at a time and walked away silently she was still waiting for judgment to strike and he said woman where are thine accusers and she looked up and said they're all gone lord he said neither do i accuse thee and here's where the church world and denomination gets it wrong they stop there they stop at neither do we accuse thee god loves everybody but he didn't do that he said neither do i accuse thee go and sin no more now that was not another rule or a commandment but prophecy over her life the difference is is one she would have to do herself which is the law of moses and the blood of bulls and goats that she'd been a part of her whole life her life of religion that all had done is brought her to the spot where she is at where the religion was about to put her to death but the difference between that and prophecy over her is when god puts forth thus saith the lord over your life it's not for you to bring to pass it's for him to bring to pass so each time you see god christ himself throughout scripture tell someone go and sin no more he's not giving them an instruction but he's prophesying over their life for where their next step is going to go it doesn't mean you'll never trip up you'll never fail doesn't mean you'll never backslide in fact the minute you get for each time god blesses you get ready no matter what type of blessing it is in fact if it's a spiritual blessing get ready all the more if you've just had god has come and revealed something to you personally and the holy spirit is working on your life get ready because the devil's going to come at you and you know it's possible you might stumble but you won't fall and you won't stay down because god is using it he's working things out in your life we can see this in the lives of the apostles look at peter himself good example right is peter if all the people who had a revelation you would think it was peter upon this rock of revelation christ said i'll build my church he said peter i give you the keys right now we know that was symbolic but peter had all these experiences and he's out and he's teaching and he's preaching and he had the experience with at cornelius house after he had been at simon the tanners and and that she had come down with all those unclean animals in it and the lord told him rise up and eat right he had a personal experience where god had spoke to him and told him don't call unclean what i call clean i mean how much more clear could it be then he sends him over to cornelius house and they all received the holy ghost before even being baptized peter saw that peter was a part of that he was the spearhead of that first one to go to the gentiles okay and we get a few years down the road and you know what peter's doing he's playing favorites and he is playing a religious game between the jews and the gentiles when the jews aren't there he eats with the gentiles freely when the jews are there he separates himself so he can still look good under the law peter you know how we know that because it says so in scripture paul had to openly rebuke him he said peter what are you doing you know better and he had to repent get up and keep moving it doesn't mean he didn't have the holy ghost doesn't mean that god wasn't revealing things to him it means he had a slip up it means he stumbled it means something was put in his way but god allows that because he's working in our lives and he's going to use that to bless someone else down the road so if you've had a situation where you're like wow i really messed that up how could i have done that don't worry about it if god's revealed it to you just move on if he sends someone nicely to tell you hey you know brother jordan i notice when you're around this person and this person you do this thing and that thing and around this other person you don't and it seems a little bit like a double standard don't make any excuses no you know it's because of this and this and that they say oh wow i'm so sorry i i apologize and i need to go make that right with these other brothers you know that's what peter had to do he had to get all of them together that he'd been playing this game with the gentiles and the and his jewish brethren put them all in one room mix them all together i bet that was a tense situation probably a line right down the middle right segregated all the way and peter got to get before and be like well brothers i have something to confess i've fallen into an old rut under the law and i'm living a double standard and a double life and i'm not being the example of christ to you that i should be and i have to ask all of you to forgive me and know that it's wrong and we are all one in christ and move forward and move forward now we don't ever see where paul ever mentioned that about peter again because that is the spirit of christ the correction comes you make it right you move on and from there we you go straight into the book of hebrews where all it is is one hero of the faith after another where god just lists them and and and by faith juan hernandez and by faith stephen jambivi and by faith joshua ali and by faith and by faith and by faith and just insert your name amen that's the end of the story if you make it right and that should be the end of the story for each one of us with each other because so many times we know too much about each other and what i mean by that is we we keep too much on our memory bank because someone will have done something in their past and they've made it right and they've asked for forgiveness from whoever it is that they have to that they did wrong they've asked for forgiveness from the lord and they've been forgiven on both accounts on all accounts but you've got a little tally book whether it's physical or in your brain or you remember i remember that time you did that i remember the time you said that i remember that time you weren't acting so christ-like i remember the time when you kind of had a funny belief and then someone they'll come to you and say you know brother i just noticed this or sister i noticed this that you know i just don't think that's very christ-like and i just wanted to let you know um come to you just in case it's something you weren't aware of or and if i'm wrong then i'm wrong and you forgive me for that and we go aha who are you to be telling me i remember when you why because we're we're not we're not feeling very safe in what we believe if you know that you know that you know then a challenge of faith whether it comes by way of someone challenging what you believe or it comes by way of someone challenged you to believe more and that's what that is a someone coming to you in love to to say hey you know i just noticed this now that's not open open room for everyone to just go criticizing everyone because you don't like the way they do something you better know that it has a scriptural basis so i say be careful because you may fall into the realm of tempting the lord thy god but but the true way the the body was meant to work in union with each other supporting each other lifting each other up whether it's lifting each other up in in in in a kind word or in in whatever it is some type of support or going to them you're also lifting someone up and saying hey i think you can do a little bit better i think we can do better together and if i'm wrong in saying that then forgive me for that and lift each other up right because we're meant to as iron sharpeneth iron to strengthen each other it's even common and when we come and we discuss the word and we're thinking about things you know there's things that we've over the last 20 and 30 years or whatever however long it's been we've heard certain people say certain things you're like oh that sounds good i believe that and you just go on knowledge you take it as a word of knowledge right and it sounded good and the person who said it said it real well and a little bit later someone else comes along and says something you're like well that don't drive right well you got to be wrong because i'm not wrong and there's two options for that well never mind there's three either one of you is wrong both of you are wrong or neither of you are wrong you see but we don't typically give ourselves those options we typically as human beings only have two options i'm right or you're right which means i'm wrong or you're wrong and i already know i'm right which means you're wrong but that's not the way the scripture is you see because god reveals things to people and that take that same scripture that you read and you saw and you're like wow that's so beautiful and he'll open it up to someone else and they'll see something totally different now they'll both be according to the word because you should be able to take whatever that thought is whatever that idea is whatever that revelation is and trace it throughout the scripture from genesis to revelation and see it ring true back and forth back and forth and you should so when someone comes and says something and challenges you like wow i've never heard it that way before share a little bit more with me where do you see that where are you seeing that in the scripture how are you seeing that where are you seeing that in the message and not in a challenging way because many times you're like well i don't know that doesn't sound right to me show me right but it's more it should be more i've never seen that before and take that approach well maybe god is trying to show you something new and maybe he's using someone else to do it because that's what brother ram said he said the hardest thing god ever had to do was get one man to believe another man that's why it's the foolishness of preaching why because we all come before you flawed human beings flawed men each one of us comes to each other flawed people and the hardest thing god has to do is get you to believe that he could use someone else so flawed and how do you know they're so flawed because you know yourself and how flawed you are even though you may not admit it to yourself or anyone else and if you know that of yourself then you naturally will assume that of everybody else and that's the hardest thing god has to do is use someone else that you know has so many flaws to come and bring something to you that is truth especially if you're not wanting to hear it but that's why our approach has always got to be lord whatever it is let me not be afraid let me not fear the challenge of my faith let me say lord let every opportunity be won for me lord show me a little bit more but if you don't the first thing you do is you you'll shut that person down as quickly as possible now you've lost your ability to share the truth with them so you've broken that line of communication you've broken that fellowship and that's what the devil wanted the whole time anyways is that he may want you god may have set that that person in your path whether it's at church at work at school someone you invited over to your house to fellowship with either because you need something or they need something and the minute you shut it down and break fellowship it's not going to happen anymore now there's a wedge between brothers but if you'll just humbly say lord use me in whatever way you will whether you have something to teach me or you have something you would like me to share with this individual and help me to remain humble you see because that was the example of the prophet of this age i got one quote that i want to read to you that i feel like many of us find ourselves in but and then one example is standing in the gap and brother branham's talking a little bit before about his ministry and how god's kept him and how he's done his best to walk by faith but too many of the times he he just waited for god to do everything and the angel of the lord told him don't do that no more he said i gotta try walking by faith more and just step out no matter what the consequence and what i believe god is doing in my life knowing that god will catch me if i go in the wrong direction and he keeps going and this is 1963. so think this is we're just a couple years from the end of his ministry right so he's not a young minister he's not young in the gospel he's been through a lot of battles he's been a lot of places god's revealed a lot of things to him in paragraph 159 i don't know if you can find that josh but if not i'll just read it and these ricky's enriquetas that we have so sassed the words and i've called them ricky and raquetta god gave me to understand i shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children i'm they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold formal churches has got them that spirit upon them and they're in prison as israel was in prison just as moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that love jesus christ would serve him if they only know what to serve him by and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells him don't you do this and don't you do that but the call of god must come whoever wants to march towards the promised land let him march we're on our road to the promised land amen let them come march we're on our road to meet christ at the end time and i want to bring this to you so that you would see and show you that the mistake a man can make yet being sincere moses lost the feeling of the of his people because they wouldn't listen to him and brother roy you see your dream and now i cannot go i cannot go with a ministry like that until i feel different in my heart about it no matter if god did tell me but that is that change that brother roy that's seen coming something's got to change me because i in my heart if i go out there feeling the way i do now i still feel that they ought to have heard that message they ought to have done it and i don't have the feeling for the people that i should until i can get that feeling there's no need in me going because i'd be a hypocrite and all these years i tried to serve him with a true heart and i won't go out there being a hypocrite i got to feel that that that isn't ricky and raketa it isn't this bunch it's god's children that's in bondage that i must go to until i can feel that way i'll just have to loaf around and preach some conventions and things but wait you see here the prophet of the lord it had preached and he had spoken to the people he said every time i preach every time i go across the country and every time i come back he said it's worse than ever before i feel like what's the point and he began blasting the people because he took personal offense that they were not accepting his message like samuel samuel said lord what's what's going on with saul he's rejecting me and god told him he's not rejecting you he's rejected me this isn't between you and saul and and we see here a prophet the lord of this age got that same feeling that same attitude where he said what's the point i scour across the nation i preach the truth and it just gets worse and worse and worse and he wasn't talking about the world he was talking about the churches every single time and the lord the angel of the lord came to him and said you got to stop that he said you're beating the people he said and those are my children he said don't worry about the masses this was never about the masses this is about calling the few the chosen and that one that you think is that ricky that ricketta the one that you see that you think is going so far that's my son that's my daughter i'm working not you this is not your work to begin with it's been my work from the very beginning and i am still working i am still working and he said until i can get over this until my heart is right towards the people you know he said that about prayer lines he said whenever i pray for someone he said i try and put myself in their shoes so i can feel what they're feeling and enter into that that prayer for them for deliverance for whatever it is this is because if i'm not standing in that same place as them he said i can't be as the same amount of help and it's the same all across the board it's that humility of spirit lord if it were not for grace there's where i would be too you see and as a revelation of grace pours out in your heart and you see something and you see someone failing you see someone struggling you see someone going through something your first reaction isn't the same as the scribes and pharisees isn't the same as those who on the the the man who was left beaten and bloody and the scribes and pharisees walked around him so as that not to dirty their garments perchance his filth might get on me but our reaction should be the same as the good samaritan and that is to come in and do all we can to bind them up bind the broken-hearted to raise them up to encourage them that story was not just about someone who was physically beaten and bruised see bones and flesh are easier to heal but a broken spirit a damaged heart a life lost in sin those are the things that truly require binding require healing require attending to but we're so worried sometimes that if we were to associate ourselves with that we might get our own garments dirty by association and that wasn't our example of christ that wasn't our example of any of god's true servants he went to them in their need the place where they needed him and he didn't condemn they said how can i help you zacchaeus come down out of that tree i'm going to your house today what you're a tax collector in public and i know i knew all that before you got up in the tree this morning you really didn't need to do that as short as you are being who i am i would have found you anyways right like blind bartimaeus calling out from the roadside they say the den around those gates was so loud most of the time with a crowd of that size there is no possible earthly way he would have ever heard him so it wasn't his yelling it wasn't his crying out but it was his heart that touched the savior you see and that's how it is for each of us is we should as grace has taken a hold in our lives then if it's grace in your heart then grace is what should come from the heart you see the same level of forgiveness as what you've received is what should be given forgiveness should never establish a self-righteousness but forgiveness helps you to acknowledge how far gone you were when the savior saved you and how great his grace is that can be extended to your neighbor you see belief if you believe you're forgiven it'll create an action or you can extend that same belief to anyone else there's no one so far gone but what can be saved if they have faith and believe and if it takes effect in their lives so i say to each one of you who has accepted that forgiveness find someone to extend that forgiveness too because that's what it was meant for gifts given to you were not just meant to be held but they were meant to be shared and those of you looking for forgiveness stop trying to forgive yourself it'll never work just believe in the work he's already done are you if you're struggling with something if you're struggling with the way you dress in church in school at work all the above don't worry about it just get deeper in love with jesus ask him ask him for a closer relationship a closer walk said lord i just want to love you more musicians would come and actually if you would play that song i just want to love you more say lord i just want a deeper relationship with you i want my friendship to grow i want to be like abraham as he walked across the pain the plains of memory and he could look up and see three men coming in the distance and from a distance he could identify you i want that kind of relationship so that in the cooler evening like adam you would come down and walk with him and speak lip to ear lord come and speak to me not just here to this morning in church but lord every day let me walk with you come down and move on my heart lord let it be that way when i wake up in the morning i feel you there as i go throughout my day i feel you there when i go to bed in the evening i feel you there that i always know that if i just reach my hand up your hand is already reaching down to grab a hold of and even the times i don't reach up you'll catch me if i fall to know that your presence is that near saints you won't have to worry about the things you're struggling with one by one they'll just melt away like a distant memory and you'll just have to you one day you'll be going oh didn't i used to do that what happened i don't i don't even remember the last time i even had the desire to do that you see but if you struggle with it and you continue to try and stop doing it yourself you are spending so much time trying not to do something you're wasting time you could be spending with him you see if if you're in your room or you're in your living room or you're wherever it is that you go you're in your car maybe you're in that little place that you're you're you're in college you're in school you're in class whatever it is and you have that little place that you go from time to time where or you're just walking down the hall and you're even in the midst of everybody you're by yourself in those moments [Music] instead of worrying about the things that you're struggling with just reach out to jesus say lord i sure could use this one more touch today father i'm just thinking about how pressured it is here i am i'm walking amongst hundreds if not thousands of people lord and how blessed i am that out of these thousands out of these hundreds of the people in this room you chose me and just wait and see how how his presence will come down and it don't take nothing it doesn't take no special formula of a prayer it just takes you being sincere with him and he'll come on down and and all of a sudden you'll you'll feel his presence and you'll be standing around all these people you'll be driving down the road you'll be sitting in class and all sudden the tears will just start coming to your eyes and someone will ask you why are you crying they say i don't know i'm just so happy i'm just so blessed i can't help it i can't help it to think of where i could have been and he saved me from and how blessed i am to fill his presence you know it can happen anywhere i've been in i've been in a biology class for for the study of evolution imagine that [Music] reading through the books and they're talking about it and all of a sudden night a thought comes to me and they say you know all these different times that there's been catastrophic things happen in the earth it's always been some form of global warming that we think has done it and we it's happened six times now if it happens again it will be a seventh now i'm not making any doctrine or anything weird out of it but for me that i thought wow isn't that amazing man is so afraid and doing everything they can to alter the direction of the earth and what's happening [Music] and yet it is from all intents and purposes probably something they cannot put a stop to and they are so afraid to admit that because it puts them out of control but how beautiful is it knowing what we know to hear that we're headed towards the seventh and i don't know that it means anything but for me i just thought god is so perfect in all his ways how perfect that he would come down and with a cleansing of fire on the seventh time for something beautiful for his children will he use this earth again for something else i don't know has he used it how many times before this has he used it i don't know all i know is everywhere you start to look you'll see him and you're not afraid you're not afraid to to sit in a class where they're there they think that most of what they're teaching is contradictory but you'll surprise them because you'll go you know what they'll say yeah you know people who believe the earth is only six thousand years old you know the the the creationist group and you're like oh i don't believe that they go what yeah no we don't know how old the earth is the bible doesn't say so all we know was that out of a darkness and a void he began to work and the history of man as we know it is what we believe to be about 6 000 years old you see it takes all the argument out takes it all away and you can just focus on him you know so many times we're so focused on trying to defend the bible or defend the message or defend this it doesn't need you to defend it you see when jesus told the disciples that he was going to send them into all the ends of the earth and before kings and potentiates he didn't sell them okay so here's what you're going to do get the books of moses get the books of the prophet matthew mark luke john you guys i want you to write out the history of what happened here with me and i always want you to study it really well because you need to know every single word so you go before these people you can make a proper argument he didn't say that and he doesn't say that today he said have no fear but when you go before them i'll give you the words to say he didn't say they'll all believe you but he said you can go without fear knowing that when you stand there in the presence of jehovah not in the presence of some king not in the presence of some teacher not in the presence of some boss some supervisor not in the presence of a classmate not in the presence of a teammate in the presence of jehovah why he said wherever you go they're all be said if you'll just acknowledge me i'm there and when you get to speak don't worry about it don't don't think oh i gotta say just the right thing just let him speak through you let him speak through you to that classmate let him speak through you to that co-worker and he don't worry about it because he'll give you the exact right time to do it too you don't have to struggle with that either but he'll give you the right moment and you'll know it is because you'll just feel that presence come down [Music] right there and you'll be speaking and it won't matter what's going on around you but you'll be fellowshipping and god will be moving on the scene how much if god can do that with you and an unbeliever how much more can he do that with each one of us when we get together in fellowship we bring our lips of fire together don't worry about saying the right thing let him speak let him speak through you let him speak through your brother dear sister let's pray heavenly
