[0:00] tradition for moses said honor thy
[0:02] father and thy mother
[0:04] and whoso curseth father or mother let
[0:06] him die the death but ye say if a man
[0:08] shall say to his father or mother it is
[0:11] corban that is to say a gift by
[0:13] whatsoever thou might just be profited
[0:15] by me he shall be free
[0:17] and ye suffer him no more to do ought
[0:19] for his father or his mother
[0:21] making the word of god of none effect
[0:23] through your tradition which he have
[0:24] delivered
[0:26] and many such like things do ye
[0:28] and when he had called all the people
[0:30] unto him he said unto them hearken unto
[0:32] me every one of you and understand
[0:34] there is nothing from without a man that
[0:36] entering into him can defile him but the
[0:39] things which come out of him
[0:41] those are they that defile the man
[0:43] if any man have ears to hear let him
[0:45] hear
[0:46] and when he was entered into the house
[0:47] from the people his disciples asked him
[0:49] concerning the parable and he saith unto
[0:51] them are ye so without understanding
[0:54] also
[0:55] do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing
[0:57] from without entereth into the man it
[0:59] cannot defile him because it entereth
[1:01] not into his heart but into the belly
[1:04] and goeth out into the draft purging all
[1:06] meats
[1:07] and he said that which cometh out of the
[1:10] man
[1:11] that defileth the man
[1:13] for from within out of the heart of men
[1:16] proceed evil thoughts
[1:18] adulteries fornications murders thefts
[1:22] covetousness wickedness
[1:24] deceit
[1:25] lasciviousness an evil eye
[1:28] blasphemy pride foolishness
[1:30] all these evil things come from within
[1:33] and defile the man
[1:35] and from thence he arose and went into
[1:37] the borders of tyre and zidane and
[1:39] entered into a house
[1:41] and would have no man know it
[1:43] but he could not be hid for a certain
[1:46] woman whose young daughter had an
[1:47] unclean spirit heard of him and came and
[1:49] fell at his feet
[1:51] the woman was a greek a syrophoenician
[1:53] by nation and she besought him that he
[1:55] would cast forth the devil out of her
[1:57] daughter
[1:58] but jesus said unto her
[2:00] let the children first be filled
[2:03] for it is not meat to take the
[2:05] children's bread and to cast it unto the
[2:07] dogs
[2:08] and she answered and said unto him yes
[2:10] lord
[2:11] yet the dogs under the table
[2:14] eat of the children's crumbs
[2:16] and he said unto her
[2:18] for this saying
[2:20] go thy way. the devil is gone out of my
[2:23] daughter
[2:24] and when she was come to her house she
[2:26] found the devil gone out and her
[2:28] daughter laid upon the bed
[2:30] and again departing from the coasts of
[2:32] tyre and zidane he came unto the sea of
[2:34] galilee through the midst of the coasts
[2:36] of decapolis
[2:37] and they bring unto him one that was
[2:39] deaf and had an impediment in his speech
[2:41] and they beseech him to put his hand
[2:43] upon him
[2:44] and he took him aside from the multitude
[2:46] and put his fingers into his ears and he
[2:48] spit and touched his tongue
[2:51] and looking up to heaven he sighed and
[2:53] saith unto him
[2:56] that is be opened
[2:58] and straightway his ears were opened and
[3:00] the string of his tongue was loosed and
[3:02] he spake plane
[3:04] and he charged them that they should
[3:06] tell no man
[3:07] but the more he charged them so much the
[3:09] more a great deal they published it and
[3:11] were beyond measure astonished saying he
[3:14] hath done all things well
[3:16] he maketh both the deaf to hear and the
[3:18] dumb to speak
[3:21] in those days the multitude being very
[3:22] great and having nothing to eat jesus
[3:25] called his disciples unto him and saith
[3:27] unto them i have compassion on the
[3:29] multitude because they have now been
[3:30] with me three days and have nothing to
[3:32] eat and if i send them away fasting to
[3:34] their own houses they will faint by the
[3:36] way for divers of them came from far
[3:40] and his disciples answered him
[3:42] from whence can a man satisfy these men
[3:44] with bread here in the wilderness and he
[3:46] asked them how many lobes have ye and
[3:48] they said seven
[3:50] and he commanded the people to sit down
[3:51] on the ground and he took the seven
[3:53] loaves and gave thanks and break and
[3:55] gave to his disciples to set before them
[3:57] and they did set them before the people
[4:00] and they had a few small fishes
[4:02] and he blessed and commanded to set them
[4:05] also before them
[4:06] so they did eat and were filled
[4:09] and they took up of the broken meat that
[4:10] was left seven baskets
[4:13] and they that had eaten were about four
[4:15] thousand
[4:16] and he sent them away
[4:18] and straightway he entered into a ship
[4:19] with his disciples and came into the
[4:21] parts of dalmanutha
[4:24] and the pharisees came forth and began
[4:25] to question with him seeking of him a
[4:27] sign from heaven tempting him
[4:30] and he sighed deeply in his spirit and
[4:32] saith
[4:33] why does this generation seek after a
[4:35] sign
[4:36] verily i say unto you there shall no
[4:38] sign be given unto this
[4:40] generation and he left them
[4:43] and entering into the ship again
[4:44] departed to the other side
[4:47] now the disciples had forgotten to take
[4:48] bread neither had they in the ship with
[4:50] them more than one loaf
[4:52] and he charged them saying take heed
[4:55] beware of the leaven of the pharisees
[4:58] and of the leaven of herod
[5:00] and they reasoned among themselves
[5:02] saying it is because we have no bread
[5:05] and when jesus knew it he saith unto
[5:06] them why reason ye because ye have no
[5:09] bread
[5:10] perceive ye not yet neither understand
[5:14] have ye your heart yet hardened
[5:17] having eyes see ye not and having ears
[5:19] hear ye not and do ye not remember
[5:22] when i break the five loaves among five
[5:24] thousand how many baskets full of
[5:26] fragments took ye up
[5:28] they say unto him twelve
[5:30] and when the seven among four thousand
[5:32] how many baskets full of fragments took
[5:34] ye up and they said seven and he said
[5:37] unto them how is it that ye do not
[5:39] understand
[5:41] and he cometh to bethsaida and they
[5:43] bring a blind man unto him and besought
[5:46] him to touch him
[5:47] and he took the blind man by the hand
[5:49] and led him out of the town and when he
[5:52] had spit on his eyes and put his hands
[5:54] upon him he asked him if he saw ought
[5:57] and he looked up and said
[5:59] i see
[6:00] man as trees
[6:02] walking
[6:04] after that he put his hands again upon
[6:06] his eyes and made him look up
[6:08] and he was restored and saw every man
[6:11] clearly
[6:12] and he sent him away to his house saying
[6:14] neither go into the town nor tell it to
[6:16] any in the town
[6:18] and jesus went out and his disciples
[6:21] into the towns of caesarea philippi
[6:24] and by the way he asked his disciples
[6:26] saying unto them
[6:27] whom do men say that i am
[6:29] and they answered john the baptist but
[6:32] some say elias and others one of the
[6:34] prophets
[6:35] and he saith unto them
[6:37] but whom say ye that i am
[6:39] and peter answereth and saith unto him
[6:41] thou art the christ
[6:43] and he charged them that they should
[6:44] tell no man of him
[6:46] and he began to teach them that the son
[6:49] of man must suffer many things
[6:51] and be rejected of the elders and of the
[6:53] chief priests and scribes
[6:55] and be killed
[6:56] and after three days rise again
[6:59] and he spake that saying openly and
[7:02] peter took him and began to rebuke him
[7:04] but when he had turned about and looked
[7:06] on his disciples he rebuked peter saying
[7:08] get thee behind me satan
[7:11] for thou savorist not the things that be
[7:13] of god but the things that be of men
[7:17] and when he had called the people unto
[7:18] him with his disciples also he said unto
[7:21] them
[7:21] whosoever will come after me
[7:24] let him deny himself and take up his
[7:26] cross and follow me
[7:28] for whosoever will save his life
[7:30] shall lose it but whosoever shall lose
[7:33] his life for my sake and the gospels the
[7:35] same shall save it
[7:37] for what shall it profit a man
[7:39] if he shall gain the whole world
[7:41] and lose his own soul or what shall a
[7:44] man give in exchange for his soul
[7:47] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[7:49] me and of my words in this adulterous
[7:51] and sinful generation of him also shall
[7:54] the son of man be ashamed when he cometh
[7:56] in the glory of his father with the holy
[7:58] angels
[8:00] and he said unto them verily i say unto
[8:02] you that there be some of them that
[8:04] stand here which shall not taste of
[8:06] death till they have seen the kingdom of
[8:07] god come with power
[8:09] and after six days jesus taketh with him
[8:12] peter and james and john and leadeth
[8:15] them up into an high mountain apart by
[8:17] themselves and he was transfigured
[8:19] before them
[8:20] and his ramen became shining
[8:23] exceeding white as snow so as no fuller
[8:27] on earth can white them
[8:29] and there appeared unto them elias with
[8:31] moses
[8:33] and they were talking with jesus
[8:35] and peter answered and said to jesus
[8:37] master it is good for us to be here and
[8:40] let us make three tabernacles one for
[8:42] thee and one for moses and one for elias
[8:46] for he whisked not what to say for they
[8:48] were sore afraid
[8:50] and there was a cloud that overshadowed
[8:51] them and a voice came out of the cloud
[8:53] saying this is my beloved son
[8:56] hear him
[8:58] and suddenly when they had looked round
[9:00] about
[9:01] they saw no man anymore
[9:03] save jesus only with themselves
[9:06] and as they came down from the mountain
[9:08] he charged them that they should tell no
[9:10] man what things they had seen till the
[9:12] son of man were risen from the dead
[9:15] and they kept that saying with
[9:17] themselves questioning one with another
[9:19] what the rising from the dead should
[9:21] mean
[9:22] and they asked him saying why say the
[9:24] scribes that elias must first come
[9:27] and he answered and told them
[9:29] elias verily cometh first and restoreth
[9:32] all things
[9:33] and how it is written of the son of man
[9:35] that he must suffer many things and be
[9:37] set at naught but i say unto you that
[9:40] elias is indeed come
[9:42] and they have done unto him whatsoever
[9:44] they listed as it is written of him
[9:47] and when he came to his disciples he saw
[9:49] a great multitude about them and the
[9:51] scribes questioning with them
[9:53] and straightway all the people when they
[9:55] beheld him were greatly amazed and
[9:57] running to him saluted him
[10:00] and he asked the scribes
[10:02] what question ye with them
[10:04] and one of the multitude answered and
[10:06] said master i have brought unto thee my
[10:08] son which hath a dumb spirit and
[10:10] wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him
[10:13] and he formeth and gnasheth with his
[10:15] teeth and pineth away
[10:17] and i spake to thy disciples that they
[10:19] should cast him out and they could not
[10:21] he answereth him and saith o faithless
[10:24] generation
[10:26] how long shall i be with you
[10:28] how long shall i suffer you
[10:30] bring him unto me
[10:32] and they brought him unto him
[10:34] and when he saw him straightway the
[10:35] spirit tear him and he fell on the
[10:37] ground and wallowed foaming
[10:40] and he asked his father how long is it
[10:42] ago since this came unto him
[10:44] and he said of a child
[10:47] and of times it hath cast him into the
[10:48] fire and into the waters to destroy him
[10:51] but if thou canst do anything
[10:53] have compassion on us and help us
[10:56] jesus said unto him
[10:57] if thou cast believe
[10:59] all things are possible to him that
[11:01] believeth
[11:02] and straightway the father of the child
[11:04] cried out and said with tears lord i
[11:06] believe help thou mine unbelief
[11:11] when jesus saw that the people came
[11:12] running together he rebuked the foul
[11:14] spirit saying unto him thou dumb and
[11:17] deaf spirit i charge thee come out of
[11:19] him and enter no more into him
[11:21] and the spirit cried and rent him sore
[11:24] and came out of him
[11:26] and he was as one dead in so much that
[11:28] many said he is dead
[11:31] but jesus took him by the hand and
[11:33] lifted him up and he arose
[11:36] and when he was come into the house his
[11:38] disciples asked him privately why could
[11:41] not we cast him out and he said unto
[11:43] them
[11:44] this kind can come forth by nothing but
[11:46] by prayer and fasting
[11:49] and they departed thence and passed
[11:50] through galilee
[11:51] and he would not that any man should
[11:53] know it for he taught his disciples and
[11:55] said unto them the son of man is
[11:57] delivered into the hands of men and they
[11:59] shall kill him
[12:01] and after that he is killed he shall
[12:03] rise the third day
[12:05] but they understood not that saying and
[12:07] were afraid to ask him
[12:10] and he came to capernaum and being in
[12:12] the house he asked them what was it that
[12:14] ye disputed among yourselves by the way
[12:18] but they held their peace for by the way
[12:20] they had disputed among themselves who
[12:22] should be the greatest
[12:24] and he sat down and called the twelve
[12:26] and seth unto them
[12:28] if any man desire to be first
[12:31] the same shall be last of all and
[12:33] servant of all
[12:35] and he took a child and set him in the
[12:37] midst of them
[12:38] and when he had taken him in his arms he
[12:40] said unto them whosoever shall receive
[12:42] one of such children in my name
[12:44] receiveth me
[12:45] and whosoever shall receive me receiveth
[12:48] not me
[12:49] but him that sent
[12:50] me and john answered him saying
[12:53] master we saw one casting out devils in
[12:56] thy name and he followeth not us and we
[12:59] forbid him because he followeth not us
[13:02] but jesus said forbid him not
[13:04] for there is no man which shall do a
[13:06] miracle in my name that can lightly
[13:08] speak evil of me
[13:09] for he that is not against us is on our
[13:12] part
[13:13] for whosoever shall give you a cup of
[13:15] water to drink in my name because ye
[13:17] belong to christ verily i say unto you
[13:19] he shall not lose his reward
[13:22] and whosoever shall offend one of these
[13:24] little ones that believe in me
[13:27] it is better for him that a millstone
[13:28] were hanged about his neck and he were
[13:30] cast into the sea
[13:33] and if thy hand offend thee cut it off
[13:35] it is better for thee to enter into life
[13:37] maimed than having two hands to go into
[13:40] hell into the fire that never shall be
[13:42] quenched
[13:43] where their worm dieth not and the fire
[13:46] is not
[13:46] quenched and if thy foot offend thee cut
[13:49] it off it is better for thee to enter
[13:51] halt into life than having two feet to
[13:54] be cast into hell into the fire that
[13:56] never shall be quenched where their worm
[13:58] dieth not and the fire is not quenched
[14:01] and if thine eye offend thee pluck it
[14:03] out
[14:04] it is better for thee to enter into the
[14:06] kingdom of god with one eye than having
[14:08] two eyes to be cast into hellfire
[14:12] where their worm dieth not and the fire
[14:14] is not quenched
[14:16] for every one shall be salted with fire
[14:19] and every sacrifice shall be salted with
[14:22] salt
[14:23] salt is good
[14:25] but if the salt have lost his saltness
[14:28] wherewith will ye season it
[14:31] have salt in yourselves
[14:34] and have peace one with another
[14:37] and he arose from thence and cometh into
[14:39] the coasts of judea by the father side
[14:40] of jordan and the people resort unto him
[14:43] again and as he was want he taught them
[14:45] again
[14:47] and the pharisees came to him and asked
[14:48] him is it lawful for a man to put away
[14:50] his wife
[14:52] tempting him
[14:53] and he answered and said unto them
[14:55] what did moses command you
[14:57] and they said
[14:58] moses suffered to write a bill of
[15:00] divorcement and to put her away
[15:02] and jesus answered and said unto them
[15:04] for the hardness of your heart he wrote
[15:06] you this precept but from the beginning
[15:08] of the creation god made them male and
[15:10] female for this cause shall a man leave
[15:13] his father and mother and cleave to his
[15:15] wife and they twain shall be one flesh
[15:19] so then they are no more twain but one
[15:21] flesh
[15:22] what therefore god hath joined together
[15:25] let not man put asunder
[15:27] and in the house his disciples asked him
[15:29] again of the same matter and he saith
[15:31] unto them whosoever shall put away his
[15:33] wife and marry another committeth
[15:34] adultery against her and if a woman
[15:37] shall put away her husband and be
[15:38] married to another she committeth
[15:40] adultery
[15:41] and they brought young children to him
[15:43] that he should touch them and his
[15:44] disciples rebuked those that brought
[15:46] them but when jesus saw it he was much
[15:48] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[15:50] little children to come unto me and
[15:52] forbid them not
[15:53] for if such is the kingdom of god
[15:56] verily i say unto you whosoever shall
[15:58] not receive the kingdom of god as a
[16:00] little child he shall not enter therein
[16:03] and he took them up in his arms put his
[16:05] hands upon them and blessed them
[16:08] and when he was gone forth into the way
[16:10] there came one running and kneeled to
[16:12] him and asked him good master what shall
[16:14] i do that i may inherit eternal life
[16:17] and jesus said unto him why call us thou
[16:19] me good
[16:21] there is none good but one
[16:23] that is god
[16:25] now knowest the commandments
[16:28] do not commit adultery do not kill
[16:30] do not steal
[16:32] do not bear false witness
[16:34] defraud not
[16:36] honor thy father and mother
[16:40] and he answered and said unto him master
[16:41] all these have i observed from my youth
[16:44] then jesus beholding him loved him and
[16:46] said unto him
[16:48] one thing thou lackest
[16:50] go thy way
[16:51] sell whatsoever thou hast and give to
[16:53] the poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[16:55] heaven and come
[16:57] take up the cross and follow me
[17:00] and he was sad at that saying and went
[17:02] away grieved for he had great
[17:04] possessions
[17:06] and jesus looked round about and saith
[17:07] unto his disciples how hardly shall they
[17:10] that have riches enter into the kingdom
[17:12] of god
[17:13] and the disciples were astonished at his
[17:15] words but jesus answereth again and
[17:17] saith unto them children how hard is it
[17:20] for them that trust in riches to enter
[17:22] into the kingdom of god
[17:24] it is easier for a camel to go through
[17:26] the eye of a needle than for a rich man
[17:28] to enter into the kingdom of god
[17:31] and they were astonished out of measure
[17:33] saying among themselves
[17:35] who then can be saved
[17:37] and jesus looking upon them seth
[17:40] with men
[17:41] it is impossible
[17:43] but not with god
[17:44] but with god all things are possible
[17:48] then peter began to say unto him lo we
[17:50] have left all and have followed thee and
[17:53] jesus answered and said
[17:54] verily i say unto you there is no man
[17:57] that hath left house or brethren or
[17:59] sisters
[18:00] or father or mother or wife or children
[18:03] or lands for my sake and the gospels but
[18:06] he shall receive a hundredfold now in
[18:08] this time houses and brethren and
[18:10] sisters
[18:11] and mothers and children and lands
[18:14] with persecutions
[18:16] and in the world to come
[18:18] eternal life
[18:20] but many that are first shall be last
[18:23] and the last first
[18:26] and they were in the way going up to
[18:27] jerusalem and jesus went before them and
[18:30] they were amazed
[18:31] and as they followed they were afraid
[18:34] and he took again the twelve and began
[18:36] to tell them what things should happen
[18:37] unto him saying behold we go up to
[18:40] jerusalem
[18:41] and the son of man shall be delivered
[18:42] unto the chief priests and unto the
[18:44] scribes and they shall condemn him to
[18:46] death and shall deliver him to the
[18:48] gentiles
[18:49] and they shall mock him and shall
[18:51] scourge him and shall spit upon him and
[18:54] shall kill him
[18:55] and the third day he shall rise again
[18:58] and james and john the sons of zebedee
[19:01] come unto him saying master
[19:03] we would that thou should just do for us
[19:04] whatsoever we shall desire
[19:07] and he said unto them
[19:08] what would ye that i should do for you
[19:10] they said unto him grant unto us that we
[19:13] may sit one on thy right hand and the
[19:15] other on thy left hand in thy glory
[19:18] but jesus said unto them ye know not
[19:20] what ye ask
[19:23] can ye drink of the cup that i drink of
[19:25] and be baptized with the baptism that i
[19:28] am baptized with
[19:30] and they said unto him we can
[19:32] and jesus said unto them
[19:35] ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i
[19:37] drink of and with the baptism that i am
[19:39] baptized with all shall ye be baptized
[19:42] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[19:43] left hand is not mine to give but it
[19:46] shall be given to them for whom it is
[19:47] prepared
[19:49] and when the ten heard it they began to
[19:50] be much displeased with james and john
[19:53] but jesus called them to him and saith
[19:55] unto them ye know
[19:57] that they which are accounted to rule
[19:59] over the gentiles exercise lordship over
[20:01] them and their great ones exercise
[20:04] authority upon them but so shall it not
[20:07] be among you
[20:09] but whosoever will be great among you
[20:10] shall be your minister and whosoever of
[20:13] you will be the chiefest shall be
[20:15] servant of all
[20:16] for even the son of man came not to be
[20:19] ministered onto but to minister
[20:22] and to give his life a ransom for many
[20:26] and they came to jericho and as he went
[20:28] out of jericho with his disciples and a
[20:30] great number of people blind bartimaeus
[20:33] the son of timeas sat by the highway
[20:35] side begging and when he heard that it
[20:37] was jesus of nazareth he began to cry
[20:39] out and say jesus thou son of david have
[20:42] mercy on me
[20:43] and many charged him that he should hold
[20:45] his peace but he cried the more a great
[20:47] deal thou son of david have mercy on me
[20:50] and jesus stood still and commanded him
[20:52] to be called
[20:54] and they call the blind man saying unto
[20:56] him be of good comfort rise he calleth
[20:58] thee
[21:00] and he casting away his garment rose and
[21:02] came to jesus
[21:04] and jesus answered and said unto him
[21:06] what wilt thou that i should do unto
[21:08] thee.
[21:09] the blind man said unto him
[21:11] lord
[21:12] that i might receive my sight
[21:15] and jesus said unto him
[21:18] go thy way
[21:19] thy faith hath made the whole
[21:22] and immediately he received his sight
[21:24] and followed jesus in the way
[21:28] and when they came nigh to jerusalem
[21:29] unto beth fiji and bethany at the mount
[21:31] of olives he sendeth forth two of his
[21:33] disciples and saith unto them go your
[21:35] way into the village over against you
[21:37] and as soon as you be entered into it
[21:39] you shall find a cult tied where on
[21:41] never man sat lose him and bring him and
[21:44] if any man say unto you why do ye this
[21:47] say ye that the lord hath need of him
[21:49] and straightway he will send him hither
[21:52] and they went their way and found the
[21:54] cult tied by the door without in a place
[21:56] where two ways met and they loose him
[21:58] and certain of them that stood there
[21:59] said unto them what do ye loosing the
[22:01] cult
[22:03] and they said unto them even as jesus
[22:05] had commanded
[22:06] and they let them go
[22:08] and they brought the cult to jesus and
[22:10] cast their garments on him and he sat
[22:12] upon him
[22:13] and many spread their garments in the
[22:15] way and others cut down branches off the
[22:17] trees and strawed them in the way
[22:20] and they that went before and they that
[22:21] followed cried saying hosanna blessed is
[22:25] he that cometh in the name of the lord
[22:27] blessed be the kingdom of our father
[22:29] david that cometh in the name of the
[22:31] lord hosanna in the highest
[22:34] and jesus entered into jerusalem and
[22:37] into the temple
[22:39] and when he had looked round about upon
[22:40] all things
[22:42] and now the even tide was come
[22:44] he went out onto bethany with the twelve
[22:47] and on the morrow when they were come
[22:49] from bethany he was hungry
[22:51] and seeing a fig tree far off having
[22:53] leaves he came if happily he might find
[22:55] anything thereon and when he came to it
[22:57] he found nothing but leaves for the time
[22:59] of figs was not yet
[23:02] and jesus answered and said unto it
[23:04] no man eat fruit of thee hereafter
[23:06] forever
[23:07] and his disciples heard it
[23:10] and they come to jerusalem and jesus
[23:12] went into the temple and began to cast
[23:13] out them that sold and bought in the
[23:15] temple and overthrew the tables of the
[23:17] money changers and the seats of them
[23:19] that sold doves and would not suffer
[23:22] that any man should carry any vessel
[23:23] through the temple
[23:25] and he taught saying unto them is it not
[23:27] written my house shall be called of all
[23:30] nations the house of prayer
[23:32] but ye have made it a den of thieves
[23:35] and the scribes and chief priests heard
[23:37] it and sought how they might destroy him
[23:40] for they feared him because all the
[23:41] people was astonished at his doctrine
[23:44] and when even was come he went out of
[23:46] the city
[23:48] and in the morning as they passed by
[23:51] they saw the fig tree dried up from the
[23:53] roots
[23:54] and peter calling to remembrance saith
[23:56] unto him master behold the fig tree
[23:59] which thou cursed is withered away
[24:01] and jesus answering seth unto them have
[24:04] faith in god
[24:05] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[24:07] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[24:09] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[24:12] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[24:14] shall believe that those things which he
[24:16] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[24:18] whatsoever he saith
[24:20] therefore i say unto you what things
[24:22] soever ye desire when ye pray believe
[24:25] that ye receive them and ye shall have
[24:27] them
[24:29] and when ye stand praying forgive if ye
[24:33] have ought against any
[24:35] that your father also which is in heaven
[24:37] may forgive you your trespasses
[24:40] but if ye do not forgive neither will
[24:42] your father which is in heaven forgive
[24:44] your trespasses
[24:45] and they come again to jerusalem
[24:47] and as he was walking in the temple
[24:49] there come to him the chief priests and
[24:51] the scribes and the elders and say unto
[24:53] him by what authority doest thou these
[24:55] things and who gave thee this authority
[24:57] to do these things
[25:00] and jesus answered and said unto them
[25:03] i will also ask of you one question
[25:07] and answer me
[25:08] and i will tell you by what authority i
[25:10] do these things
[25:12] the baptism of john was it from heaven
[25:15] or of men
[25:16] hansome
[25:18] and they reasoned with themselves saying
[25:20] if we shall say from heaven he will say
[25:22] why then did ye not believe him
[25:25] but if we shall say of men
[25:28] they feared the people for all men
[25:30] counted john that he was a prophet
[25:31] indeed
[25:33] and they answered and said unto jesus
[25:35] we cannot tell
[25:37] and jesus answering saith unto them
[25:40] neither do i tell you by what authority
[25:42] i do these things
[25:48] [Music]
[26:19] you
