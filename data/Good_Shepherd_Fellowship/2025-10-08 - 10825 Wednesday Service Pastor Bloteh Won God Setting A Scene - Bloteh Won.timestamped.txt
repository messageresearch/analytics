[21:32] that time and yet uh I never had time
[21:35] enough. Praise the Lord. I never had
[21:38] time enough because there were just a
[21:40] lot of things that I noted down. But uh
[21:44] let me let me say this to you. Uh uh you
[21:47] know uh I think brother Brandon said it
[21:50] somewhere. You know uh
[21:54] leading the church is just like flying a
[21:56] plane. and flying a plane, the highest
[21:59] thing is to get it off the ground.
[22:02] Praise the Lord. The the pilot never
[22:05] goes into autopilot until the plane has
[22:08] got off the ground.
[22:11] And uh uh and when you get off the
[22:15] ground, you cannot stay in the air
[22:17] forever. You got to come down to refuel.
[22:19] So I believe that we are refueling.
[22:21] Amen.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Because we have got this thing up
[22:24] before. Amen. And I believe we can get
[22:26] it up again.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; You know, just praying on the weekend.
[22:30] Uh uh I was I was really really thinking
[22:33] that I would come and I really wanted to
[22:35] vent on you. You people talk to me. I
[22:38] just listen. I wanted to use Sunday as
[22:41] my time to just vent. But at a certain
[22:44] point of time, I mean the Lord just he
[22:47] just ministered to my heart that I need
[22:49] to trust him. Amen. I need to trust him.
[22:53] So there were just a lot of things I
[22:55] just thought that I should I should you
[22:57] know I should just uh forget about them
[23:02] you know and just uh encourage you a
[23:04] little bit talk to you and then we just
[23:06] pick up few of the things and but thank
[23:08] you thank you there were many many
[23:10] people that supported the children's
[23:12] Sunday school it was coming from every
[23:15] word and that was that was very
[23:17] impressive and also there were many
[23:19] people that also supported the church
[23:22] building project. So that was that was
[23:24] good. That was good. And uh so thank
[23:27] you. Thank you for bearing with me. If
[23:30] uh if we have any other update for you
[23:32] or I need to come back and vent again, I
[23:36] will I will beg for time with you. Amen.
[23:38] I will beg for time with you. But uh it
[23:41] was it was good. And and the thing about
[23:44] it there also uh uh one of my my the
[23:49] major thing that was that was really on
[23:51] my heart was uh you know uh uh like we
[23:56] said brother Brandon said we come to
[23:58] church to become better people and we
[24:01] cannot become a better people until we
[24:04] have a better environment
[24:06] &gt;&gt; to be able to grow in for us to become
[24:08] better. So I want you to labor with me.
[24:12] Let's let's work together and create an
[24:14] atmosphere. Amen.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; For us to become better people. Praise
[24:18] the Lord.

[26:57] &gt;&gt; Every every problem is for an testimony.
[27:01] Amen. There's a testimony behind every
[27:04] problem. So uh uh that that teach us to
[27:08] take comfort in the things that uh
[27:14] Yeah. Okay. So, uh, tonight, let's just
[27:17] let's just take our Bibles. Revelation
[27:19] chapter 5. Revelation chapter 5. Let's
[27:23] go to Revelation chapter 5 tonight. And,
[27:26] uh, it's 8:15. I have uh 45 minutes or
[27:31] so to to be able to hold you here. And I
[27:35] just pray that it's a good 45 minutes.
[27:37] Praise the Lord. It's a good 45 minutes.
[27:43] Revelation chapter 5. We been been kind
[27:45] of for dwelling on this, you know. Uh,
[27:47] and I thank the Lord that I went into
[27:49] this gear because if I was not in this
[27:52] space, maybe I would have just been all
[27:55] over the place preaching like an
[27:57] evangelist trying to trying to make my
[28:01] frustration a message. That's a horrible
[28:03] thing to do.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; That's a very, very horrible thing to
[28:06] do. Praise the Lord. Amen. Revelation
[28:09] chapter 5, let's just read.
[28:13] And I saw in the hand of him that sat on
[28:16] the throne a book
[28:19] written within and on the backside
[28:22] sealed with seven seals.
[28:25] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[28:29] with a loud voice, who is worthy to open
[28:34] the book and to loose the seals thereof.
[28:40] Praise the Lord. who is worthy to open
[28:43] the book and to loose the seals thereof.
[28:47] Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, in
[28:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, bless
[28:51] your word and come speak to us tonight.
[28:54] May something be said of eternal value.
[28:57] Something that the souls of your
[28:58] children can feel on something that can
[29:00] build faith and strength for the hour
[29:03] that we are living in. In Jesus name we
[29:06] pray. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may
[29:08] have your seat while we stay right there
[29:11] in in in uh Revelation chapter 5. But
[29:14] why the reason why I stopped on that
[29:17] verse because I wanted to I wanted to
[29:20] bring up another principle
[29:24] uh uh out of the book of Romans. Romans
[29:28] chapter 8. We'll go back to Revelation
[29:31] chapter 5 but Romans chapter 8.
[29:35] Praise the Lord.
[29:37] Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:04] God be for us. Who can be against us?
[30:08] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul says here.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Now Paul will speak here and says that
[30:22] uh
[30:24] uh
[30:27] Romans chapter 8,
[30:31] let's read from verse 32. He that spare
[30:33] not his own son, but deliver him up for
[30:36] us all. How shall he not with him also
[30:40] freely give us all things? He has given
[30:43] us all things. Now watch the principle
[30:46] that I wanted for for us to look at
[30:48] tonight. Who shall lay anything to the
[30:52] charge of God elect? Amen.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5 was who is worthy.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; So that's that's what I want you to keep
[30:59] in your mind. Who shall lay anything to
[31:01] the charge of God elect? It is God.
[31:05] It is God that justifieth.
[31:08] Who is he that condemnth?
[31:11] It is Christ
[31:13] that died. Yeah. Rather, that is raising
[31:16] again who is even at the right hand of
[31:20] God who maketh intercession for us. So
[31:23] which mean Christ will not be the one
[31:25] that condemn. Amen. The board is asking
[31:28] who laid anything to God's to God's
[31:31] elect and elect cannot persecute illet.
[31:33] Amen. Who
[31:36] is he that condemnth? Christ will not
[31:38] condemn because he was the one that gave
[31:40] his life. He was the one that raised
[31:42] again. Amen. And make intercession for
[31:45] us. Then he said this also. Who shall
[31:48] separate us? So we see three wolves
[31:50] here. Now what? Watch what I want to
[31:53] look at. Who shall separate us from the
[31:56] love of Christ? Shall tribulation, shall
[32:00] distress, persecution, famine,
[32:02] nakedness, per or swore? Now uh uh we
[32:07] have we I've talked on this before. I've
[32:09] used this before, but uh just thinking
[32:12] about who is worthy and before we go
[32:15] back there, my mind came back to this.
[32:18] Now Paul is saying, who shall separate
[32:21] us? Who is he that condemnth? Who will
[32:24] lead anything to God's uh uh to the
[32:26] charge of God's elect? Who shall
[32:29] separate us? Then he come and said shall
[32:32] persecution. Now uh grammatically you
[32:36] will not use woo for persecution.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; You would say what shall separate us?
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:44] But you see here there is a person.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; There's a personality
[32:50] that is behind
[32:52] &gt;&gt; persecution.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; There's a person that is behind
[32:57] distresses.
[32:59] There's a person that is behind
[33:02] uh persecution, tribulation, famine, you
[33:06] know, nakedness, swallow wall. There is
[33:10] a personality. Now you have to think
[33:12] about the the beast
[33:16] &gt;&gt; the rathers. Amen.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; This is the same person here. So Paul is
[33:22] saying who shall separate us?
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Then he said find me tribulation.
[33:31] So which mean there is a personality
[33:33] that is disguised
[33:35] &gt;&gt; behind everything that we are dealing
[33:38] with.
[33:40] Yeah.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Are you Are you seeing it?
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Whether it is farming, whether it is uh
[33:50] uh uh illnesses in our body, anything
[33:54] that want to separate us from the love
[33:56] of God. It is not it's not just the
[33:59] weather.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. It's not just the
[34:03] weather. I'm not just honor the weather.
[34:06] No, there is something. There is a
[34:08] being. There is a person, there is a
[34:10] there's there's a creature, there's a
[34:12] power, there's an influence that want to
[34:15] separate you from the love of God.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; So it's not just a persecution. It's not
[34:28] just that they are persecuting me.
[34:32] No, there is there is a being that is
[34:35] disgust in that.
[34:37] Praise the Lord.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; And when you can be able to identify the
[34:43] being,
[34:44] then you can know how to fight your
[34:46] battle. Amen.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; You can know how to face your
[34:49] persecution.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Then you not you don't make it uh uh
[34:54] people, person, government,
[34:55] &gt;&gt; but you deal with that spirit.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; As soon as you identify it, then it
[35:02] helps you to run to the city of refuge.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Because you know that there is a spirit
[35:11] that is behind this thing.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; It is not just people attitude or people
[35:17] don't love me but there is a spirit
[35:20] &gt;&gt; that is trying to separate you from the
[35:23] love of God.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So that's what I wanted
[35:28] to to uh to that's that's where I wanted
[35:32] to start off tonight. Revelation chapter
[35:33] 5. Let's go back there. while you are
[35:36] having the comfort of your seat and uh
[35:40] verse two I saw
[35:44] a strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[35:46] voice who is watered down. So here again
[35:50] who is used is looking for a person a
[35:53] personality not just anything not just
[35:56] anybody or uh not just anything let me
[35:59] say it that way but it's looking for the
[36:01] person and not just anybody too because
[36:04] this person has to be a wealthy person.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Who is wealthy to open the book and to
[36:12] lose the seals thereof. And the Bible
[36:15] says, "No man,
[36:19] no man."
[36:22] And Yis said, "We have this book of life
[36:26] in our hands, in the shelf, in our
[36:28] homes, have it on our phone, and we can
[36:31] go there and read, copy, paste, and and
[36:33] send to people, and we can read it and
[36:36] and you know, and and and and you know,
[36:38] express our our thought about it." But
[36:41] yet the Bible says no man was warfare.
[36:45] No man in heaven, not even the earth,
[36:48] neither under the earth, which mean all
[36:50] those that lived and were gone from Adam
[36:53] uh uh uh to to John the Baptist neither
[36:58] to look there on to open the book or to
[37:00] look there on. The Bible says, "And I
[37:03] and I wept much because no man was found
[37:06] worthy to open the book." So I was
[37:09] thinking about this today and I was just
[37:11] looking at the parallel. Now here is uh
[37:14] uh one that is also disguised behind
[37:17] this need. There's a there's a being
[37:20] here that is being required. If there is
[37:22] no man that is worth then how is the
[37:26] book going to be open?
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh right here also give
[37:34] us an idea. If there is no man that was
[37:38] warfare then the word creator amen had
[37:42] to now step down
[37:44] &gt;&gt; he has to come down and take the form of
[37:47] a man because it was a man
[37:51] &gt;&gt; that was required here who is walking.
[37:54] They was not looking for, you know, a
[37:56] lamb or a lion or uh uh uh you know, a
[38:01] ox. They were looking for a man.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Woo is one thing.
[38:11] You will not I don't think you will use
[38:13] woo for a lion.
[38:18] You cannot use woo for a lamb.
[38:22] You use woo for a person.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Am I right?
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. As far as uh uh uh my
[38:29] English is, I think I'm right on that
[38:32] one. Amen. I'm proud of myself.
[38:36] Praise the Lord.
[38:40] No man. So, so which mean here if no man
[38:45] in heaven
[38:47] the earth and have ever lived and under
[38:50] the earth was worthy then there must be
[38:54] one.
[38:56] But yet this one will still have to be a
[38:58] man because the advertisement the
[39:02] proclamation was for who is wanting. So
[39:06] there have to be a person.
[39:08] So it has to be a kingsman.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; It has to be a kingsman.
[39:16] Praise the Lord.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Who is wealthy? And I wept much because
[39:20] no man was formed worthy to open and to
[39:24] read the book neither to look there on.
[39:29] Praise the Lord. Our service tonight
[39:32] will be useless if there was now one
[39:34] that came forth
[39:37] &gt;&gt; to open the book.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Our service will be useless because
[39:40] we'll be reading. How can you read from
[39:42] a closed book?
[39:45] &gt;&gt; You will just be guessing.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; You'll be guessing. I think the first
[39:50] chapter in this book, if I can remember,
[39:53] I think they told me in there maybe is
[39:56] Jeremiah.
[39:58] you'll just be guessing because it's a
[39:59] closed book,
[40:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; And I mean uh whatever sounds very close
[40:10] to truth, you will believe it easily.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why you know people uh
[40:16] h motivational speakers can can see
[40:20] something that sound so close to
[40:22] reasoning but it's not from an open
[40:25] book.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:27] Amen.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; It's just good enough for your spirit to
[40:30] feel on it, but your soul will never
[40:32] feel on there
[40:34] &gt;&gt; because the soul can only feel on what
[40:36] comes from the open book.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, that sounds Oh yeah, I never
[40:43] thought about that. Oh man, I never
[40:45] thought about that. Sounds so truth.
[40:50] is good for your mind.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; And your mind keeps spinning, but it
[40:54] can't drop down to your soul because
[40:56] your soul does not have a taste for
[40:58] that.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; The soul can only feed on what comes
[41:03] from God's mouth.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let me let me share where I
[41:13] want to go tonight.
[41:15] where I want to go tonight. I'm still
[41:17] talking about my my uh my beast and
[41:21] rider and uh uh the last sermon I put
[41:26] the riders and the beast. I think we
[41:28] should change that. It's not riders.
[41:30] It's just one rather it's one that is
[41:33] just riding on different beasts. So we
[41:35] will have to change that. The first I
[41:37] got it right. The second one I tried to
[41:39] change it but we will correct that now.
[41:42] So tonight I I wanted to take from
[41:45] Revelation chapter 5 here and uh uh let
[41:49] me let me read down a little bit. Oh my
[41:51] goodness me. Oh man.
[41:55] Let me read down a little bit
[42:00] tonight.
[42:02] Praise the Lord.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:07] What a mighty God we serve.
[42:12] is a good one too.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay.
[42:17] Uh so let's let's read down a little bit
[42:20] here. And I wept much. No man was for
[42:23] walting to open and to read a book,
[42:26] neither to look there on. And one of the
[42:27] elders said unto me, weep not behold the
[42:30] lion of the trap of Judah, the root of
[42:33] David have prevailed to open the book
[42:37] and to and to lose the seven seals
[42:41] thereof.
[42:42] Praise the Lord.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before I go further, I'll be away
[42:46] this weekend. It just popped in my mind.
[42:49] I'll be away this weekend. Brother Per
[42:51] annual meeting comes up and uh he asked
[42:54] for us to speak for him on Sunday. So uh
[42:57] pray for me. I'll be sharing uh the
[43:00] meeting with brother Ben and brother
[43:02] Clay Farmer. So uh just pray for me.
[43:06] Praise the Lord. And then also uh uh
[43:10] pray for brother Avery. He will preach
[43:11] for us on Sunday too. So okay, let's get
[43:15] back to reading here. Verse six. And I
[43:18] beheld and loo in the midst of the
[43:20] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[43:24] midst of the head of stool a lamb
[43:28] as it have been slain
[43:31] having seven horns
[43:33] and seven eyes
[43:36] which are the seven spirit of God sent
[43:40] forth into all the earth. So I wanted to
[43:44] look at the seven spirit tonight.
[43:48] We not we're not done with our our our
[43:50] rather and be here yet. But there was
[43:53] something that caught my mind and that's
[43:55] what I want to share with you tonight if
[43:56] we will get there. Let's take our first
[43:59] quote here. Revelation chapter 5. This
[44:00] is what caught my mind. Brother Brandham
[44:02] said very beautiful, very beautiful, you
[44:05] know. Uh uh
[44:08] it really did not digest it like like
[44:10] the way it is digested to me. Now he
[44:13] says here he says now we find out that
[44:17] in the first beginning of the chapter
[44:22] and we find the revelation revelation uh
[44:26] find the fifth chapter
[44:29] is just a tie block.
[44:33] Amen. He call it a tie block.
[44:37] Uh man uh u I forget I didn't send the
[44:41] picture up there. He call it a tie
[44:43] block. He call it a diamond hinge that
[44:47] tie the last part of the church ages of
[44:53] Revelation chapter 3. Now listen
[44:55] carefully because uh it's very easy to
[44:58] go over your head if uh and and I've
[45:01] read it read it. It went over my head
[45:04] many times, but this time it was just
[45:06] like an arrow that pierced my heart.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; It went over my head. I don't think I
[45:13] was I was purposely dodging it, but I
[45:17] was just not getting it. But this time,
[45:19] it just hit me. Now, listen to what he
[45:21] says here. We find out that revelation
[45:24] uh the fifth chapter is just a tie blood
[45:29] a diamond hinge that tie the last part
[45:33] of the church ages of revelation chapter
[45:36] 3. So revelation five
[45:41] ties
[45:42] the last end of revelation 3.
[45:48] You will understand as we read a little
[45:51] bit. He says here the fourth chapter
[45:55] tells what John
[45:57] was taken up into heaven. And the fifth
[46:00] chapter is preparing
[46:04] where you went through the seven church
[46:07] ages. Then John lifted up in the fourth
[46:11] chapter. And the fifth chapter he's just
[46:15] setting the scene.
[46:17] He's setting the scene here for the
[46:20] opening of the seals
[46:23] just as he did in the first chapter of
[46:28] in in the first chapter of Revelation.
[46:32] So, Revelation chapter one was setting
[46:36] the scene for the church ages.
[46:41] Revelation chapter 5 is setting the
[46:44] scene.
[46:46] Praise the Lord.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; You'll get the picture as we go along.
[46:54] I'll go into setting the scene and if
[46:55] there is any time left then we'll get
[46:57] into the seven spirit. I want you to get
[47:00] that picture correctly. He says
[47:02] revelation the the fifth chapter is just
[47:04] setting the scene here for the opening
[47:07] of the seals just as he did in the first
[47:11] chapter of Revelation opening the way
[47:14] for the seven church ages. Listen to
[47:17] this now. There he stands in the seven
[47:20] golden candlesticks and
[47:24] and he's to look upon as jasper and
[47:27] sadder stones and uh he's preparing for
[47:32] those seven church ages. Now he's
[47:35] preparing for the opening of the seven
[47:38] seals of redemption.
[47:41] That's what the fifth chapter is. That
[47:44] is the reason I kind of read it and then
[47:48] just take it from there and talk on it
[47:53] and give other parts of the scripture is
[47:56] because it isn't verse by verse. The
[48:01] scene that is happening are not verse by
[48:04] verse,
[48:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Because it's setting a scene. It's
[48:08] almost like when you when you're about
[48:10] to watch uh h a movie and then uh they
[48:15] give you uh h a starting a starting
[48:19] picture of all the players.
[48:22] Sometimes they are not talking. They
[48:25] just come this the the little boy he's
[48:26] riding his bicycle and his name comes up
[48:31] you know and he run around the house and
[48:34] then another person come and and the
[48:36] lady come and you know uh uh and she's
[48:39] uh you know she's standing on a porch
[48:40] and she doing like you are not hearing
[48:42] what she's saying
[48:46] but you're seeing and all of these part
[48:48] that comes at the beginning are going to
[48:51] be part of the big picture.
[48:55] Are we together?
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; So he's he's telling us both Revelation
[49:03] chapter 1 and Revelation chapter 5 is
[49:08] not a verse byvere happening. Okay,
[49:14] &gt;&gt; they're happening the the the the the
[49:17] things happening in the chapter. Verse
[49:19] seven could be at the beginning,
[49:22] verse two could be at the end of the
[49:25] scene
[49:28] because sometimes you watch those things
[49:31] there, you know, and if you pay
[49:32] attention to that, you you you want to
[49:35] see the little boy that was riding the
[49:37] bicycle at the beginning of the movie.
[49:41] But sometime he does not come until
[49:44] maybe in the middle of the movie.
[49:50] You see, but the little boy that is
[49:52] riding the bicycle could be the
[49:54] newspaper man. He could be the manager
[49:56] in that movie, but it just show him
[49:59] riding the bicycle.
[50:01] And as you follow the movie, then you
[50:03] realize he was riding the bicycle to
[50:06] school. He went to school and then he
[50:08] graduate. That's how he became the
[50:10] manager of the company.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; But all of those things are not in the
[50:14] scene.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Are we getting the picture?
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:23] Oh, this thing was beautiful. I was
[50:25] making movie this morning.
[50:28] When I was studying this, I was making
[50:30] movie in my mind.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; I was trying to set the scene.
[50:34] But God is a movie maker. I will tell
[50:36] you.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had a great drama in his mind.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's a movie maker.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the reason he says here
[50:48] that's the reason I kind of for read it
[50:50] and then just take it from there. I talk
[50:53] on it and give other parts of the
[50:55] scripture. So he says I talk on this
[50:57] part and then I move to another part of
[50:59] the scripture to explain it because this
[51:03] is just a scene.
[51:05] You will not fully understand it if we
[51:07] just go verse by verse, verse by verse.
[51:10] It does not explain. It does not have
[51:12] all of the details.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[51:18] &gt;&gt; It don't have all the details. It just
[51:20] set you in the scene. It says uh yes. So
[51:24] other part is because it it is in verse
[51:28] by verse something that's happening
[51:33] is preparing for something to happen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Something to happen.
[51:46] Oh, I love this. And if you get the
[51:48] preparation, if you get the preparation
[51:52] and you are paying attention,
[51:54] praise the Lord, you are praying
[51:57] attention, you get the preparation,
[52:00] uh then you are ready for it then and
[52:03] that's the way
[52:06] it is by faith or anything is you got to
[52:10] grab the seam.
[52:12] Brother Baron says to apply faith is the
[52:14] seam. You got to grab the scene
[52:18] to be able to apply faith because uh
[52:21] faith must have its resting place.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Faith just do not, you know, you don't
[52:27] throw faith in the air that I believe
[52:29] God, you know, God, you know, God said
[52:31] you must be able to get his resting
[52:34] place. And how can you get it? Because
[52:36] you can look in the life of Sarah and
[52:38] say God did it for Sarah.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So because God did it for Sarah
[52:44] now in in in in in the in the fullness
[52:46] here now I can I can I can be able to
[52:50] see that that that was in the scene
[52:52] playing out in my life.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Because they were all types and shadow
[52:58] of us.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture?
[53:03] &gt;&gt; So we you just don't throw f oh yeah I
[53:05] believe I know that God would do it. I
[53:06] know that God would do it and you know I
[53:08] believe that God would do it. Oh,
[53:11] you must set a scene. Go into the word.
[53:15] Set a scene. I saw that he did it for
[53:18] Hana. I saw he did it for Gideon.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Gideon was nervous. He was not sure.
[53:27] And yet God called him a mighty man of
[53:30] valor
[53:32] &gt;&gt; and God was able to bring him. So no
[53:34] matter what nervousness that is going in
[53:36] my body, no matter what uh uh uh
[53:39] insecurity I'm having, I know that God
[53:42] says I'm a mighty man of illum. If he
[53:44] could bring Gideon through, he would
[53:46] bring me through also
[53:48] &gt;&gt; because the scripture is setting a
[53:50] scene.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Faith is you just don't throw faith out
[53:54] there. I believe that God will do it.
[53:57] No, look for a scene.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are you seeing the
[54:03] picture?
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh man, I love this. I
[54:07] told you I say I was I was making movie
[54:09] this morning.
[54:11] I love it. I love it. I love it. Let me
[54:14] do something here quickly.
[54:16] Isaiah chapter 61.
[54:19] Isaiah chapter 61.
[54:23] Amen.
[54:25] Isaiah chapter 61.
[54:41] Are we together tonight?
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:47] Is the word of God getting home?
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 61, let's read here.
[54:56] For the spirit of the Lord God is upon
[54:58] me because he have anointed me to preach
[55:01] good tidings unto the meek.
[55:05] He has sent me to burn up the
[55:07] brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to
[55:10] the captives, and the opening of the
[55:12] praising to them that are bound, to
[55:14] proclaim the acceptable year of the
[55:16] Lord, and the day of virgins of our God,
[55:20] to comfort all that mourn, to appoint
[55:24] unto them that mourn in Zion, to give
[55:27] unto them beauty of h for arches, oil of
[55:31] joy, for moouring garment of praise, for
[55:33] the spirit of heaven ess that they might
[55:36] be called the tree of righteousness, the
[55:39] planting of the Lord that he might be
[55:42] glorified.
[55:44] Are we together?
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Right here, God set a scene.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; He's going to he's Isaiah is prophesying
[55:55] about the Miah. He's talking about his
[55:59] entire ministry,
[56:01] the the three and a half years he will
[56:04] spend on earth and the ministry that
[56:06] will also be fulfilled in the gentile.
[56:09] Everything is right here.
[56:12] Praise the Lord.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; This prophecy even cover you and myself.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Now let's go to St. Luke chapter 4.
[56:32] Let's go to St. Luke chapter 4. This is
[56:34] familiar ground for you, but uh
[56:39] uh
[56:41] it's okay.
[56:46] So Luke chapter 4, let's let's read from
[56:49] verse 14.
[56:51] I want to read from verse 14 tonight.
[56:54] The Bible says uh uh and Jesus
[56:57] returning, he was returning from the
[56:59] wilderness.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had just gone through the
[57:03] temptation in the wilderness. He was
[57:05] coming out of the wilderness. But this
[57:07] is what I want you to pay attention to.
[57:10] Jesus returning in the power of the
[57:14] spirit. He's returning in the power of
[57:18] the spirit. what the Isaiah said, the
[57:20] spirit of the Lord God is upon me.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; That's what Isaiah said.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So now he's returning
[57:35] in the power of the spirit into Galilee
[57:38] and there went out affirm of him through
[57:42] all the region around about and he
[57:44] taught in their synagogues
[57:47] uh being glorified of all. So he left
[57:50] Galilee now he comes into Nazareth
[57:53] because this scene that was set in
[57:55] Isaiah is about to be play out. the part
[57:59] that Isaiah could not say. Isaiah never
[58:03] talk about him going in Galilee. Isaiah
[58:06] never talk about him, you know, going in
[58:09] Nazareth. Isaiah just said, "The spirit
[58:11] of the Lord God is upon me for he have
[58:14] anointed me." But yet Jesus now is
[58:18] coming to play out everything that
[58:20] Isaiah said.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Right from the wilderness, he went into
[58:25] Galilee. The spirit of the Lord is upon
[58:27] him. He went into the synagogues, you
[58:29] know, he's teaching. He's speaking to
[58:31] the people. He came down to Nazareth.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Now, see here now, uh, like I said, this
[58:40] is familiar territory. I took it back a
[58:42] little bit just to get your attention.
[58:44] And he came to Nazareth where he was
[58:46] brought up. And as his custom was, he
[58:49] went into the synagogues again on the
[58:51] Sabbath day. His custom was to go to
[58:54] church. and and he stood up for to read
[58:58] and there was delivered unto him the
[59:02] book of the prophet. Now see here
[59:05] because the scene was set is God that
[59:09] set the scene.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; It's God that he wrote the the the
[59:16] drama.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; He wrote the movie. He's the composer.
[59:21] So when it got to this place for Jesus
[59:24] to fulfill that, he went into the
[59:27] synagogues, he's not a rabbi, he's not
[59:30] of the Sanhedrin's council. He's now of
[59:33] the priest. But because what was in the
[59:37] the the scene is about to be fulfilled.
[59:40] As he got into the synagogues, they hand
[59:43] him the straw.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; They never asked him, "Who are you? What
[59:48] school? What church you belong to?
[59:51] Because God has already written out. So
[59:54] what he did, the scene is set.
[59:57] There is something that Jesus is playing
[1:00:00] on. He's not just doing his own thing.
[1:00:03] Isaiah said, "The spirit of the Lord God
[1:00:05] is upon me."
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; So when he waited in a wilderness and
[1:00:10] the spirit of the Lord God came upon
[1:00:12] him, he came out of the wilderness.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; And he was born to step right into the
[1:00:18] synagogues. And as soon as he got there,
[1:00:20] that spirit that was upon him seized the
[1:00:23] Pharisees, they never had no argument.
[1:00:25] They said, "Yeah, take the book."
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; He took the book and the Bible says he
[1:00:34] opened to Isaiah 61.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; And he started reading what is in Isaiah
[1:00:43] 61. you open the book and he started to
[1:00:46] read and and there was delivered unto
[1:00:48] him a book of the prophet Isaiah
[1:00:52] and when he had opened the book he found
[1:00:54] the place where it is written this is
[1:00:57] where the seed was written I'm here to
[1:01:00] fulfill what is written on this scene
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; because the scene is set
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; so that's what brother Brian was telling
[1:01:09] us revelation chapter 5 is just setting
[1:01:12] the scene
[1:01:14] Amen. You cannot understand everything
[1:01:16] about the open book just in Revelation
[1:01:19] chapter 5. It's in Revelation chapter 4.
[1:01:22] It's in Revelation chapter 6.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; That's where the the the the beasts and
[1:01:29] the rathers are. But Revelation 5 is
[1:01:32] just the scene. The scene is set there.
[1:01:36] So here the scene is said Jesus comes
[1:01:39] right there. He open the book and and
[1:01:41] and and then he reading the spirit of
[1:01:43] the Lord God is upon me because he has
[1:01:46] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:01:50] poor. He has sent me to heal the
[1:01:52] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[1:01:54] the captives, the recovering of sight to
[1:01:57] the blind, to set at liberty them that
[1:02:00] are bruised, to preach the acceptable
[1:02:04] year of the Lord. So in one sense he's
[1:02:07] saying in the in the seed that is giving
[1:02:09] us is only this part we will fulfill. So
[1:02:12] when he read to preach the acceptable
[1:02:14] year of the Lord the Bible says and he
[1:02:18] closed the book. He never read
[1:02:20] everything Isaiah said.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He closed the book right there and
[1:02:27] he said to them this day
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; this scripture
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; is fulfilled. Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; From now on, everything that Isaiah
[1:02:38] said, he will he will open the blind
[1:02:40] eyes. He will set the captive free. Come
[1:02:42] and follow me because this day, this
[1:02:45] scripture, we are about to play out what
[1:02:48] is written here.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Everything that is written right here,
[1:02:52] I'm here to fulfill it.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; And he could say, I there is no sahedrin
[1:02:59] counsel that can stop me. There is no
[1:03:01] devil in hell. Even the Roman power
[1:03:04] cannot stop me because it is written and
[1:03:06] I'm here to fulfill it.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Because the scene is set.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; And that is the same thing with you and
[1:03:16] you and myself. Our being here this
[1:03:19] evening,
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; the scene is set.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. our being here in this age and and
[1:03:30] in this dark age, the scene is set.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; See what God will do.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; He's uh he's the composer of the music.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; And he's also the director.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what he would do, years would
[1:03:50] go by and and you know things will
[1:03:52] happen and then and then he this this
[1:03:54] this this uh uh this man from uh h can
[1:03:57] Turkey a seventh grade student you know
[1:04:00] uh God will raise him up with a vision
[1:04:02] do not smoke do not drink don't defile
[1:04:05] your body I have a work for you he will
[1:04:07] get in the ministry and on and on he
[1:04:09] will go and and uh uh uh and one day he
[1:04:13] will want to preach a message called
[1:04:15] birth him
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; in a full h
[1:04:21] gospel businessman meeting.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And his wife will buy him a Bible.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; it's a new Bible. And then he's he's
[1:04:31] there. Brother B don't even have an idea
[1:04:33] of what is happening. But because Isaiah
[1:04:36] wrote it,
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; the composer already wrote it
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; and he was on the scene to direct it.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "This is the time for
[1:04:45] that second part of what Isaiah said to
[1:04:49] be fulfilled."
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; So, what he's going to do, he's going to
[1:04:54] take this preacher out of his normal
[1:04:56] routine. He's not going to use his
[1:04:58] steady Bible. He's going to use a new
[1:05:00] Bible that his wife bought. And then
[1:05:02] he's looking for the page. He two pages
[1:05:05] stuck together. He's just passing. He
[1:05:07] try to read. No, this is not what I want
[1:05:08] to read. Oh, did they cut the page out
[1:05:11] of the Bible? Oh my god.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; So he asked the brother, "Is that the
[1:05:16] same thing in your Bible?" Because I
[1:05:18] can't find what I want to read. Praise
[1:05:19] the Lord.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And because God said the same, so
[1:05:24] God will repeat the same thing that
[1:05:26] happened in Jesus ministry because it's
[1:05:29] the continuation of the spirit. So then
[1:05:32] a a a Catholic priest, Bishop Stenic
[1:05:36] will take his Bible and say, "My son,
[1:05:38] take this Bible."
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Because God is about to move.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; He don't even know what is happening.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; You see, because the script is written,
[1:05:50] it cannot be different the same way it
[1:05:52] happened in Jesus ministry. It was the
[1:05:55] continuation of that scripture. It had
[1:05:57] to happen the same way.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh-huh.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; So, I mean, uh, here is their brother.
[1:06:08] They're confused. He can't understand
[1:06:09] what is happening. God arrested the the
[1:06:12] the the
[1:06:14] He arrested the atmosphere.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; He arrested all the players. I mean, he
[1:06:21] had brother Kyle Williams behind him. He
[1:06:24] had Demon Shakaran behind him. None of
[1:06:27] them gave Brother Brandham their Bible.
[1:06:29] It had to be a Catholic priest because
[1:06:32] it was a priest that gave the Bible to
[1:06:34] Jesus.
[1:06:45] Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; He set the scene. You cannot change it.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; He is the director. You cannot change
[1:06:55] it. You cannot follow the emotion of the
[1:06:58] people to change the order of the
[1:07:00] director.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Nobody could change it.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; He's talking to those preachers down
[1:07:07] there. Is this not in your Bible? I
[1:07:09] mean, it would have been easy for him to
[1:07:10] say, "Well, give me your Bible, Brother
[1:07:12] Cow Williams. Let me use it." or brother
[1:07:13] demon you're carrying or h or brother
[1:07:16] Jack Moore gave me your Bible.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; But because God was in control of the
[1:07:24] scene, God took the the he took that
[1:07:26] from their mind. They were all just
[1:07:28] sitting there looking at him.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; What what Bible is he reading from?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Because what he trying to read, he can't
[1:07:35] even find it. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:39] And then God has to anoint this uh
[1:07:42] Catholic bishop, Bishop Stanley. He
[1:07:44] stood up and said, he says, "Take my,"
[1:07:46] he said, "Take my Bible, son, because
[1:07:49] God is about to move."
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; And when brother Brandham took his
[1:07:57] Bible, it was not even a Catholic Bible.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It was not even a
[1:08:02] Catholic Bible.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon read the scripture
[1:08:11] he wanted to read from from from St.
[1:08:13] John and he closed the Bible the same
[1:08:16] way Jesus closed the book.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; He gave it back to the priest the same
[1:08:20] way Jesus gave it back to the priest.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; He's standing there preaching his
[1:08:26] message, but yet in his mind he's
[1:08:28] thinking, "What's wrong? I don't want to
[1:08:31] embarrass my wife. She gave me the Bible
[1:08:34] as a gift." But okay, I mean uh being a
[1:08:37] man that has control over the anointing,
[1:08:40] it did not bother him. Went right into
[1:08:42] his message and he preached his message.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; And as he was leaving the meeting, the
[1:08:49] Holy Ghost brought to his mind, there is
[1:08:51] something about this in the scripture.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; As he was leaving the meeting, the Holy
[1:09:00] Ghost brought there is something about
[1:09:02] this in the scripture. You have just
[1:09:04] play a scene.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; You have played out a scene that was
[1:09:09] written.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:17] And you see, brother Brandham could not
[1:09:19] say uh uh uh he was not playing out the
[1:09:25] scene that says uh uh what it says here
[1:09:32] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:09:34] Lord. That's not the scene he was
[1:09:35] playing because that was where Jesus
[1:09:37] stopped.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; So whatever Jesus never read out, that
[1:09:42] is that part that brother Brandon was
[1:09:43] playing. So, Brother Brandon was
[1:09:46] playing. Let's go back to Isaiah 61.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; We might not get into what we wanted to
[1:09:56] preach tonight, but that's good. That's
[1:09:57] good. I'm I I wanted to I wanted for you
[1:10:00] to see this and uh uh and that's that's
[1:10:02] that's good. That's what God have for us
[1:10:04] tonight. Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; And we praise him for that. Praise the
[1:10:07] Lord. Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; So you see yet in Isaiah 61, Jesus tap
[1:10:12] on verse two and to proclaim the
[1:10:14] accepted way yet of the Lord. That's
[1:10:16] where he stopped. So so so brother
[1:10:18] Brandham now that that thing he was
[1:10:20] playing out was from and the day of
[1:10:23] vengeance
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; which of course that's what he was
[1:10:27] talking in birth pains.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; He was talking about the word having
[1:10:31] birth pains. All the things that is
[1:10:34] happening is bringing the word to the
[1:10:35] place of judgment, the place of virgins.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; That's what he was talking about in that
[1:10:40] message birth pain now. So, but follow
[1:10:43] me now. And the day of virgins of our
[1:10:45] God to comfort all that mourn and to
[1:10:50] appoint because if you see it in the in
[1:10:52] the in the scripture uh uh the the the
[1:10:54] scripture did not stop there. He put he
[1:10:56] put uh h a clause for us to continue to
[1:11:00] appoint unto them that moon in Zion.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Zion is the city of David. Zion is
[1:11:08] a choosing city. So a type a choosing
[1:11:10] people.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Those that mourn in Zion, she's a type
[1:11:16] of the bride to give unto them beautyful
[1:11:20] arches.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Now, so that is the thing where most of
[1:11:26] the time when I when I talk about this,
[1:11:29] I like to make emphasis on because the
[1:11:32] acceptable year was already preached by
[1:11:34] Jesus. And those that believe the
[1:11:37] acceptable year message, they got the
[1:11:39] jubilee. Pentecost was the jubilee.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Pentecost was the fulfillment of Jesus
[1:11:45] acceptable year message because the
[1:11:47] acceptable year is the jubilee.
[1:11:50] Pentecost fulfilled that
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; our part the benefit that we supposed to
[1:11:55] get when we identify
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; the second sin is this we must get
[1:12:01] beauty for arches.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; What does that represent?
[1:12:10] Everything that we go through
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; all everything that we go through
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; we we will come out better.
[1:12:18] Praise God. Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Everything we go through, you take the
[1:12:25] burnt offering, the ashes was put into
[1:12:28] into a water consecrated and it was used
[1:12:31] for the purification
[1:12:34] of the people.
[1:12:37] So as we trust the Lord, as we hold to
[1:12:40] his word, we don't understand it. We we
[1:12:42] we I mean uh God has given us grace to
[1:12:46] to follow his word. The scene where
[1:12:48] brother Brandon could not understand why
[1:12:50] the is stuck together and and and
[1:12:53] and he didn't even know what was
[1:12:54] happening. God has wrote the scene.
[1:12:56] Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; So everything that we go through there
[1:13:03] are some we will never see it in this
[1:13:05] life. We will not see it on this side.
[1:13:07] You will not see the beauty of what you
[1:13:10] are going through on this side.
[1:13:12] But he promised to give you beauty for
[1:13:15] your aches.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh, so don't hold
[1:13:19] yourself back to be burned.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Put yourself like a burnt offering on
[1:13:24] the altar and say, "Lord, burn
[1:13:26] everything of me." Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Because I know when it come
[1:13:30] to be beautiful.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Burn my toss. Burn my desire. Burn my
[1:13:35] selfishness.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Burn my human nature
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; because I know when it come on the other
[1:13:40] side, it's going to be beautiful.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He promised to give us
[1:13:47] beautiful arches.
[1:13:49] Oh, I love this.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; And the oil of joy for morning.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Weeping might endure, but joy comes in
[1:14:02] the morning.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Those that are mourning and groaning in
[1:14:06] the spirit.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel, that's why the Bible says that
[1:14:10] that the the man with the with the ink
[1:14:12] horn, he was looking for those that were
[1:14:14] weeping for the abomination of the
[1:14:16] setting.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; So, he gave us an oil of joy, which is
[1:14:20] the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; When we learn to cry for the abomination
[1:14:25] that is done in the setting, we learn to
[1:14:27] cry for what is happening in our church,
[1:14:29] what is happening in our home, what is
[1:14:31] happening in the word. Hallelujah.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[1:14:55] depressing,
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; there's a song of joy that comes up in
[1:15:00] your heart.

[1:15:03] We shall rise. He gave you a garment of
[1:15:05] praise for the spirit of heaviness to
[1:15:08] lift up your spirit.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; That is the benefit of receiving the
[1:15:14] second portion.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; When you receive the message that has
[1:15:18] come of vengeance
[1:15:21] is vengeance on the word, but to the
[1:15:23] believer, it give you an oil of joy.

[1:15:52] tomorrow brings,
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; you say, I will praise the Lord. Because
[1:15:56] you have on a garment of praise. It's
[1:15:58] not something that you wear. You wear it
[1:16:01] when you go to the word. Amen. It's a
[1:16:03] garment that is given to you from the
[1:16:05] word.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You get the oil of joy from the
[1:16:08] word.

[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sometimes the word
[1:16:16] comes, it burn you. It rebuke you. It
[1:16:18] cut you into pieces. Put you on the
[1:16:20] altar of God.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And it looks like everybody is against
[1:16:24] you.

[1:16:41] the spirit of heaviness.
[1:16:43] Then what the Bible says that they might
[1:16:46] be called a tree of righteousness.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:17:03] to us.

[1:18:20] you to play because the scene is set.

[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; William Brandham could not bypass it.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Demon Shakara could not intervene
[1:18:29] because he was it was not an ordinary
[1:18:31] man that gave Jesus the word. It was a
[1:18:34] priest.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; God has set the scene.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Everything that is happening around us
[1:18:43] is right in the word. God has set the
[1:18:45] scene.

[1:20:05] committed, dedicated children.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; And that is the reason why, you know, I
[1:20:10] was making emphasis on what I was making
[1:20:12] up.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; The economy can go by
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; but because you have got God on the

[1:20:49] other. But not pressing.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:54] not pressing.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; When we come on the this this this
[1:21:06] second portion of the of of of of the
[1:21:09] scene that is set here, when we come all
[1:21:13] of these things, just just read the
[1:21:14] rest. Read the rest. You see, even the
[1:21:16] Gentiles, we are all part of this second
[1:21:19] portion.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Read the rest of chapter 61. It just
[1:21:23] does not stop on on verse two.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Many time we preach it, we just stop it
[1:21:28] on verse two. Read the rest of what is
[1:21:30] written there. You will see that even
[1:21:33] the Gentiles are brought in. Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Verse verse six. But ye shall be named
[1:21:40] the priest of the Lord. And that's what
[1:21:43] we are. We are king and priest. Amen.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Men shall call you the ministers of our
[1:21:49] God. Yeah. shall eat the riches of the
[1:21:51] Gentiles and in their glory shall ye
[1:21:55] boast yourself.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; It's all these promises that comes on
[1:22:02] the second fulfillment of this. This
[1:22:05] second fulfillment comes from Jesus's
[1:22:08] ministry all through the church ages and
[1:22:10] then it goes back to the Jews. this
[1:22:13] second part.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Because the the the the message of
[1:22:19] virgins was preached by Malachi 4 and
[1:22:21] it's the same message that would go to
[1:22:22] the Jews,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; So this second portion goes through the
[1:22:27] gentile through the church ages and it
[1:22:29] goes to the Jews.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; So just just think about it. All of
[1:22:38] these years from the time Jesus was
[1:22:40] here, all these years it's just in this
[1:22:43] in this uh uh chapter this chapter 61 of
[1:22:47] uh 11 verses
[1:22:50] from that day that Jesus said this day
[1:22:53] this scripture is fulfilled.
[1:22:57] Each one of these verses has been
[1:22:58] playing out
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; in history.
[1:23:02] Each one of these verses has been
[1:23:04] playing out.
[1:23:06] It play out right into verse two. That
[1:23:09] was that was Jesus's ministry when
[1:23:12] brother Brandon came. Then the rest of
[1:23:14] it start playing out because he was
[1:23:17] supposed to fulfill the half of verse
[1:23:19] two.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; So God set the scene.
[1:23:23] Everything of our life is in one of
[1:23:26] these verses or another through this
[1:23:28] book.
[1:23:33] Are we together?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; You cannot follow it verse by verse.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; It does not explain your life verse by
[1:23:42] verse. That's the scene we were in.
[1:23:43] Revelation chapter 5. That's the scene
[1:23:45] we were in with Revelation chapter one.
[1:23:47] Brother Brand say it's not a verse by
[1:23:49] verse fulfillment.
[1:23:53] The scene is all scattered out there in
[1:23:56] the chapter.
[1:23:58] It takes a prophet. It takes the Holy
[1:24:00] Ghost to put it together for us. God
[1:24:02] bless you tonight. Musicians, you can
[1:24:04] come.

[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; When you know that a scene of your life
[1:27:52] is set already in God's word,
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; this is just to bring you uh an
[1:27:59] exaltation, an encouragement. No matter
[1:28:01] what you are going through,
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; no matter what you are going through,
[1:28:05] you cannot bypass what he have laid down
[1:28:08] for you.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; You can't bypass it. Amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; You can't get around it. You will just
[1:28:13] hurt yourself.
[1:28:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; But you think about it now. Think about
[1:28:21] it. The benefit. Think about the
[1:28:23] benefit. God turning your arches into
[1:28:25] beauty.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; He turning your arches. He took the
[1:28:31] arches of Job. Job used the arches from
[1:28:34] his burnt offering. He covered above.
[1:28:37] But God turned his arches into beauty.
[1:28:40] That the Bible says his end was better
[1:28:42] than his beginning.
[1:28:45] He turned his arches into beauty. And I
[1:28:48] believe that God is going to put joy in
[1:28:52] your heart. He's going to put smile on
[1:28:54] your face. Even if that smile comes on
[1:28:57] my dying bed.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Even if it comes on my dying bed where I
[1:29:02] lay down there and tears coming from my
[1:29:04] eyes, I can say, Lord, thank you for
[1:29:07] showing me the message of the hour.
[1:29:09] Thank you for making me a part of this
[1:29:11] glorious thing. Thank you
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; for whatever you did in my life. Thank
[1:29:16] you for making me an instrument to help
[1:29:18] somebody get closer to you. Even if my
[1:29:21] joy comes on my dying bed,
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; I know that God is going to give us turn
[1:29:27] our arches into beauty. He will give you
[1:29:31] an oil of joy for all your moouring, all
[1:29:35] your tears.
[1:29:36] People will not always see the stain of
[1:29:39] your tears. You will have an oil of joy
[1:29:41] to grease your face that they cannot see
[1:29:44] that you are crying.
[1:29:47] Oh my. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. You
[1:29:51] see, that's why I keep a little bottle
[1:29:53] of oil on my table because when I weep
[1:29:55] before the Lord before I come here, I do
[1:29:57] my little makeup, rub my hands, rub it
[1:30:00] on my face. I don't want you to see my
[1:30:02] tears. My tears are to God.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:08] Oh, I feel so good tonight. Amen. I feel
[1:30:11] so good tonight. Let's pray. Heavenly
[1:30:14] Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:30:16] Christ, oh God, we just want to thank
[1:30:18] you. Thank you for setting the sin of
[1:30:20] our life. Lord, I just pray tonight, oh
[1:30:23] God, that your people can see it, that
[1:30:25] they can be able to see it, Lord, that
[1:30:27] the word can make sense to them, Father.
[1:30:29] Lord, that they should know, oh God,
[1:30:31] that when we going through these things
[1:30:33] in our life, it's not the end of the
[1:30:34] story. It's not the end of the story,

[1:30:49] Lord God, that have to go home late
[1:30:50] tonight and go to school tomorrow. We
[1:30:52] just pray that you bless them, too,
[1:30:54] Father. Bless them, oh God. Father,
[1:30:56] Lord, in a way that you can bless them.
[1:30:59] May all of this pay out in their future.
