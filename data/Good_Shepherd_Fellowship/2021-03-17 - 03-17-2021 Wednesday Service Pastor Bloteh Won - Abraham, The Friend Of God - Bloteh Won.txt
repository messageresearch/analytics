house of the lord let's just take our bibles genesis chapter 18. genesis chapter 18 praise the lord genesis chapter 18. i'm trusting the law to speak on something on sunday and uh hoping that can be able to build a foundation here but uh this is uh this is this would just be a an hesitation something we want to share with the church tonight and encourage you genesis chapter 18 praise the lord let's uh read a little bit of about the father of faith abraham praise the lord genesis chapter 18 let's read from verse 13 and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah alive saying okay well for the serial life saying [Music] of a surety better child which arm of all is there anything too high for the lord at the appointed time i will return on today according to the time of life praise the lord amen that uh that is just a little more than what i want to look at tonight verse 17 let's let's look at verse 17. and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him praise the lord for i know him for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the law may bring upon abraham that which he have spoken enough amen for i know him let us pray heavenly father lord jesus by the way of inspiration tonight you later taught on our hearts lord and and we want to just uh father find that channel tonight by getting out of the way and having you to come in and be able to take your word tonight and break it to us we love you we appreciate you father bless lord the visible and invisible audience tonight we love you father in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you can have your seed once again it's going to be in the house of the lord and we greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ sister brother wesley and sister carol sent a testimony and i was not able to pick that up on sunday and i was hoping that i would not forget tonight but sister carrot is feeling much better and she wanted to thank you for your prayers amen amen i wanted to make sure that i don't forget about that while we were praying it came to my mind again i said oh god you got to help me this mind it seems to be it's not keeping things these days praise the lord i want to talk on something trusting that the lord will be able to bless it and make it a blessing to you tonight but uh you know brother branham talk uh made a statement he says the way god did with abraham that's the way he deals with abraham c and and when we look in the in the life of abraham we realized there were principal things that god planted send god work by sea principle there were principle things that he planted in the life of abraham praise the lord and [Music] we we trust in that the law will be able to help us tonight like i said we want to we want to see it and realize that abraham is the father of faith not only that he's the father of faith but also he is the genesis he's he's the one that god was beginning you know an unconditional coveting god was beginning an unconditional coveting with abraham and a a a confident that he will that he will also relate with the rest of the world he will relate with the rest of abraham seed he will relate with the rest of the redeemed around the world praise the lord so uh when you look in the scripture and there were major things that brother branham pointed out you know in the life of abraham but there there are other things also that are lying right in the scripture and when you look in the message you know uh you read and and and and god uh by grace uh will help us to be able to see one of their tonight and and what i want to look at tonight is i want to look at abraham a friend of god i want to look at a relationship of friendship that god has with abraham because this relationship of friendship will be the center relationship is not the highest form of relationship but it's it's a central relationship that ties every other relationship as we go along you'll be able to honestly grab my thought i'm you know i'm i don't have enough words to really be able to express myself so i have to repeat myself a few times praise the lord but friendship is a it's a it's a kind of a relationship one of the many relationships that we have in this life but it's a very very very important relationship praise the lord amen from the word and the in the message of the hour we know that the marriage relationship is the highest form of relationship is the highest form of relationship amen that that we will we will enter into our experience or you know another there and our first our first form of relationship is is the relationship by birth that make us children sons and daughters so we relate to our parents as children children parents relate to us you know as parents and that's our first form of relationship but the friendship relationship is very important very very important we don't have enough time tonight so i will try to speed up a little bit and it's is this is this relationship that uh uh if the law don't help us to achieve it it brings unsettlement in the rest of your relationships i don't care whether it is parent to children children to parent husband to wife wife to husband uh working relationship relationship in church if if the the the relationship of friendship is not birth it will unbalance the rest of your relationship friendship is so important is is such a relationship that is so important that uh it looks like the center of all relationship praise the lord amen just now as we were reading here the bible says and god said i know him talking about abraham i know him i know him when you say you know somebody it's not just their name amen it's not just their name or their address you know them by nature we will look into that a little bit i pray the lord will help us tonight amen praise the lord if you're praying for me thank you for your prayers and uh so it's it's it's a it's a very serious relationship now you will realize that in adam when the scripture talks about adam and the scripture talks about the relationship that god had with adam and eve brother branham talks about the relationship that god had with adam and one of the plays that brother branham plays god's relationship with adam is is is an adopted son so adam's relationship with god was more of a son and father because every time brother branham is talking about adoption he goes back to adam how adam was placed in the garden of eden and he had authority over days he had authority over that but you also realize that i have never had a friendship relationship with god that was what he was running he was hiding you don't hide from your friend he was a son amen there are many sons that don't have relationship with their i mean friendship with their father they have relationship as sons but they don't have relationship as friends do you see where we're going tonight are you ready take your seat belt amen praise the lord so adam adam was a son made in the image of god and and and he was an amateur god he could speak to the to the to the to the the animals you know uh i mean he he was he just had control over the earth amen he had control god would come down in the evening and have fellowship with adam and and i believe that god was building because that's how friendship is built friendship is built by fellowship so god will come down in the evening and have fellowship with adam trying to build that friendship trying to build that closeness are we together amen so you will realize that it never taught abraham an overnight experience for him to be a friend of god it never took him an overnight experience amen this was a man that waited on on the promise of god for 25 years he never taught him just you know just by god speaking to him and leave your father house and leave your mother house and and leave your kindred and i'll make you father of nation for him to become a friend of god no it took the trial it took the test because it takes trial and test for you to build trust and that's one of the principal element of friendship is trust praise the lord amen it's a principle element of friendship trust so we see here through the scripture genesis 12 god spoke to abraham what about vision dreams one of those things and uh and abraham was looking for the land who makeup and builder was god he just fell in his heart he was he was so convinced right away he just thought that he was going to find his place in and he was going to have a child with his wife and if he was going to be the father of nation he was thinking about having i mean maybe maybe 25 children he had it all plain in his mind how he was going to to to to populate the earth praise the lord not knowing that god was speaking about uh uh it was it was it was uh it was a spiritual promise now but as as you watch abraham live you see that uh he traveled on in and he was with his his uh his uh cursing nephew lot and we know all the story but abraham went from one trial to another for the matter of fact if you read from genesis 12 you realize that god has seven major appearance to abraham seven major the seventh one was when elohim himself came down but he has several major uh uh uh uh appearance uh he dared with abraham differently brother branham says i've heard ye uh now i see it he says god there with abraham different with visions there were times he dealt with abraham by visions i mean different way he did with abraham so we we see that and all of that but what i'm trying to say there is that all of these different dealings it was god's way of bringing abraham to that place of friendship praise the lord now because you have to remember now abraham is the father of faith abraham god is using him as a foundation stone to be able to start a coveting an unconditional coveted and the person that you will have an unconditional covenant with is not just anybody that you meet on the street it has to be somebody that you know and god says i know him they are different different characters through the bible like even job you see job and god there with job in a level and and and and and there is there is there is uh there is a relationship that god built with job you know just and just like i said uh that about adam and but in abraham god was able to establish such a relationship think about it after waiting 25 years he told abraham give me the ball back amen and abraham being afraid he never wraps up with god are we together he never rises up with god he never he never argued with god and uh uh and he never even told his wife he never told her the details he told her they were going to sacrifice but he never told her the details praise the lord that just goes to show you some of the things that friends do some of the things that friends do so we see here let's let's let's look at this but through the scripture like the bible says the the the scripture was written by inspiration amen and made through the scripture as the holy ghost was building this picture and the picture started becoming you know developing and becoming clear there were men in the scripture that were able to see maybe maybe abraham in himself never really came to that place to have saw or to the relationship that he had with god praise the lord just like joseph never knew he was a type of christ abraham never knew they are taking isaac on top of the mountain it was going to be a type of christ he was just living his life obeying god keeping keeping secret with his friend praise the lord are we together he loved the lord tonight amen second chronicles chapter 20 joshua stood in the congregation of judah in jerusalem in the house of the lord that from verse 5. before the new court and he said oh lord god of our fathers thou annette and now thou god in heaven and ruleth their net over all the kingdoms of the hiddens and in their hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee and not there our god who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and gave it to the seed of abraham thy frame praise the lord so it's almost like you pick up a book and you are reading a story about uh about abraham lincoln or any great man and as you read the story it's not it's not clearly seen but you could see the relationship so when they read about abraham the the way they saw god dealing with abraham god intervening praise the lord when nabimi like talked abraham's wife god intervened and said you are dead don't do this i know the integrity of your heart but that man is my seventh and even go to him let him pray for you so seeing the way that god dared with abraham this man of inspiration started to to put together the picture they could see the friendship praise the lord god said i know him is there anything i can hide from him you don't hide him from your friend is there anything i can hide from abraham i know this man i can tell him my secrets why because he will even teach his children he will pass it down are we together praise the lord brother branham said this in the message lifting up letting him out of history he said there's there's another thing that i would like to say that is another thing running out running out is friendship friendship is running out it does not seem like that we have the friends that we used to have praise the lord amen it's funny but it's sad that facebook have to tell us the number of our friends praise the lord people says i have having so many friends having 300 friends that's that's how sad it is it's because friendship is running out praise the lord we are living in a world where people can't even trust themselves people are so scared are we together it doesn't seems like that we have friends that we used to have and and the friends that we have are not lawyer friends like it used to be praise the lord amen everybody goes into friendship with selfish desire they want to be the one pleased in the friendship they want to be pleased they don't want their feelings to be heard amen they want to be pleased that's the kind of friends that we have friendship right on the edge they can be they can be laughing through this door go right outside and they snap and the two that were laughing yeah yeah right now they start fussing in and you know and oh my goodness you don't have those lawyer friends like it used to be amen praise the lord is this is the you know this is the code where he says you know uh the the the neighbor passed away and then you hear by in the newspaper praise the lord you say because you know neighbors are not friends praise the lord friendship is very serious it's a serious uh relationship praise the lord that's the reason why almighty god how to take on cystine element he had to be born was to be a friend was to be a friend a friend is a one that is touched by the feelings of our infirmities praise the lord it's a very serious relationship that it took god to leave his throne to become one of us as us our creator he's already our father he made everything he gave life to us if just it's just father and and children relationship was enough he wouldn't have come and become man he was already our father he was our maker praise the lord are we together amen amen amen glory be to god when i get you into this time of dare silence then i know i get a hold of your spirit and i know now that i get a hold of your spirit i can drive the sword of this world right between the dividing asunder of your spirit and soul and you will see you will sit right there and you won't say anything because i know i get you praise the lord it's a very very serious relationship very serious isaiah chapter 41 the prophet as i mentioned the same thing are we together praise the lord isaiah 41 verse 8. you can you can just read read the entire chapter and see how the prophet isaiah built build a picture your very beautiful picture he built about uh god dealing with israel amen but thou israel is seven jacob whom they have choosing the seed of abraham my friend amen and we know also that james pick up that also in the book of james where he called abraham the friend of god so it runs through all the scripture you know it runs through all the scripture but this is what i want us to see in in here is the other uh the the reason there is because that relationship was was and is very important solomon the great says in the book of proverbs he that won't friend must show himself friendly praise the lord he that won't friend must show himself friendly jesus when he came he said make friends with mamas that in the days of adversities they might help you so it's a it's a it's a relationship that is very important but you see the uh and and and that's one of the things that uh that this this this this information technology age is bringing praise to lord people can uh uh you know can rather make friends online and you know be friendly in distance friendship don't work that way it don't work that way praise the lord they can be so nice and so friendly and then uh uh laughing face and posting this other one in order that one put those two persons together for a short period of time they get so bored there's no connection that's not friendship it's not friendship a friendship in distance was ever able to be achieved god wouldn't have become flesh he wouldn't have become flesh besides coming down to pay the ransom price to be our kingsman redeemer one of the reason why he came down was to become our friend praise the lord somebody said when jesus when god took him flesh he became our neighbor because now he can feel what we feel when jesus said who is your neighbor he became our he became our nestor neighbor such a very very important relationship but yet is neglected it's neglected and that is one of the problems of our homes of our church of our marriages of our parenting is because we are stuck in one relationship and we don't have the center that keeps it together praise the lord we don't have the center that keeps it together glory be to god it's not so it's not so difficult for parents to make the child to honest i'm your parent i'm your father it's not difficult that one is a straight shot can't miss it but there was a time genesis 1 god was a parent amen when he lost his son and lost the word right after the floor he changed his approach he says i'll become i'll become a friend now so he started dealing with abraham praise the lord in a different covenant unconditional you know why friendship is unconditional because friendship is a gift let me read a quote to you from brother branham praise the lord are we together amen but bam says who is this in the message here he says uh no what does what does that year talking about elijah if education is the way out to freedom why don't it act with all the education we have in the world if shush was standing or so forth is the way out why don't it out why don't it act if paying other nations to be our body and we find out they turn his against us praise the lord all the other nations all the other uh uh religious and form of worship has rights only the christians don't have right muslims can leave work and go and pray they can leave and you know take take an oath to be on american citizens with hot on their head and i mean they would do every other thing they have religious right but when a christian holds their bible in their hands this is uh i mean at this place you know you don't practice religion here but branham says paying others to be our buddy and we find out they turn right turn their heels against us just as soon as they can and you can't buy friendship with money friendship is a gift that's the reason why it's unconditional a fall under the unconditional coveting because it's a gift praise the lord it's a gift and that's the reason why sometimes and many times you know when talking to young people young people than all people in you know talking to people they know and want to go into uh relationships that's that's some of the things i tell them praise the lord and i think that many have talked we know that in the message we don't practice dating you know even though it's a form of friendship but because of all of the things that is attached to it amen and but sometimes many people will take courtship as their time of friendship and uh and i i don't see it like that you know courtship is is it's a higher level of friendship it's it's a friendship where you are becoming more intentional but before you become intentional you have to be a friend you have to start by just being a friend and is that friendship of respect praise the lord i mean we you have we we you know we have all of these things going on and we see a lot of a lot of the problems and and things that is happening you know when and and sometimes you know what uh people get married and then this it almost looks like they are surprised they think that whoa did i marry the wrong person praise the lord no it was the same person you love what was lacking was you did not have a friendship when you came to know one another all that was in your mind was to have a home and settle down you did not have a friendship so noah is not the wrong person it's i mean it's the same person you love it's the same person you couldn't sleep about sleep was so short it's the same god praise the lord but because there was not a friendship you know i talked to some few young people young guys and you know and they will ask me some questions the first question i asked him what are the stages of marriage that you know this journey you want to take what are the stages you know praise the lord one says you have to have the holy ghost you have to be working you have to have a house i say i told him i said that's that's good that's beautiful and it's just it's a question that makes makes the young people nervous you know and uh sometimes it's it might appear like you're trying to attack them or you're trying to tell them that they don't they they don't know what they are doing they're not prepared and you know and all of that you know but i try to take my time to explain to them and i always bring them to this place of friendship praise the lord you know then there is one there is one element you know that uh that uh does not work with friendship you you can you can hide you know you can hire your friends as you cannot hide from a friend you can also hire your friends praise the lord so just in that time of friendship the the the the young woman was she must be able to talk to her mom and dad about her friend the boy must be able to do it and and what what actually you are doing is that you are providing protection for yourself because after all he's just your friend praise the lord am i supposed to be teaching stages to marriage abraham the friend of god that's what we're talking about tonight praise the lord but it's very important you know what is very important because when that stage is net you will not you will not achieve the fullness but you have to have the foundation because your entire life journey everything you would do it will be built around that everything you would do see it in the life of abraham everything this this this that god is saying about abraham was not at the beginning of his journey this was just before he would even go down to sodom he had given abraham the promise and and and you have spoken to abraham according to the time of life and and he just realized now we we are in a season i can't hide anything from my friend i've trusted this guy praise the lord would there be disappointment in friendship yeah abraham disappointed god he needed never supposed to go down there to uh to egypt he never supposed to say that that is his wife but you see friendship is that uh you you you learn to understand the person you are dealing with brother branham said this let me let me read it so we we can we can be able to cover the night here or they took the time maybe something wrong with the clock so he says to the message who is this he says he says that's right he knows the nature of god this this really thrilled me when i read it he knows the nature of god because he was a friend of god you know you know the person you know what makes them mad you know what makes them happy you understand the person you are you are understanding this person you are learning this person praise the lord and i mean it's not it's not an overnight thinking it's not i mean it's something i mean if you if you will remain friends for life that's the thing you have to understand the nature as he knew the nature of god god also knew his nature and he says i know him i know him i know abraham praise the lord and that's the reason why god sent us or gave us a son of man ministry he gave us a life story about a prophet and in in all of the things that he did in brother branham ministry and you see how god even brought brother branham to that place of having him as a friend even from from seven years old says do not drink do not smoke do not defile your body brother branham terrified run into his mother scared to death praise the lord he didn't understand why i was there he was not from a religious home he was not born in the message praise the lord wanted to be like other boys but he was protecting his friend trying to keep him from drinking and defying his body and doing different things are we together so that's that's one that's one that's one ingredient there of friendship he knows the nature of god because he was a friend of god he knows how to take him because he knows that his promises no matter how foolish they look or how simple they look or how unreasonable they look you see like even you come to this place where we are and the internet filled with errors and have to say this about brother branham life they have to say this about brother brandon they have to you know they just it just put all sorts of things there you find that one time before all of these men discover whatever they think they have discovered they claim to have loved this message they claim to have loved the prophet but you see he was just what they call a prophet and he was not afraid to them because you don't treat your friend like that you don't treat your friend like that you don't be a friend to someone and get a bunch of dirt on them and then go on the internet and go and put it there you don't treat your friend like that people that go and put their fast church forces on internet and home fastest on the internet it just shows that they don't have no sense no ground of friendship praise the lord because when a man is your friend you understand his nature no matter what his age what his experience you understand his nature to know he's a human so if he makes mistake you are able to accommodate it you don't take the mistake that he made and cover up all the years of friendship he taught you to read your bible he taught you how to look for prophecy in the bible all of these things he teach you over the years you found one single thought that's what a man would do when his wife is not his friend she's just a wife but she's not afraid that's what a pastor would do when the people he preached to are not their friends they they disagreed he would blast them all over the country oh yeah you can disagree with a man and still respect him that's what friendship is about who told you friends don't disagree that's the thing that make the friendship sweet you disagree you argue you shout i have a buddha in myself even even brother brother stephen nigeria when stephen jarrow came here he's my good friend we set up two a.m in the morning we fast we fast we yell and then after we get hungry better let's go and look for food i tell you i'm tired let's go and find food you don't you are not married yet let's go and find food we go we eat and we we start laughing ourselves to say we the next day come again we sit down we look at what we are looking at i said look i don't see it that way but we are very good friends with all your friends don't disagree that's when you have a prophet you only want him as a prophet you want him to be holy with wings you get a little thinking oh yeah they say the prophet did this all the prophet did this he was not afraid to you if you were god abraham would not be your friend because you were put on the internet abraham live i found that paper in a court they say abraham said the woman was not here why he lie god was not sleeping when abraham did that but god says i know him i know him he's my friend [Music] and then you think you can gather things those that are already falling will fall but they are sons and daughters that are standing they are rooted in the love of god they are rooted in the love of god you love the lord tonight praise the lord praise the lord he says he knows the nature of god because he was a friend of god he know how to take him because he knows that his promises no matter how foolish they look or how simple they look or how unreasonable how unreasonable they were truth because god says so and to abraham they are set to it towards true child of god you you that saturday the word of god saves it like billy paul who says god thought that brother branham spoke it the church say amen and that's set away praise the lord brother barnum says and that's the way every seed of abraham does today that's the way the born again christian does today no matter what the word says what sign says what they say this that or the other gods were staying above it all and what is god's word behold i send you elijah the prophet that's god's word said it all amen what do you get a proof of system people fought in the bridge you cannot take malachi for from this bible he said in the dead of the voice of the seven injured when he shall begin to sound praise the lord but it has always been like that with men we always look for wu to blame and the reason why many of these people are coming to these places is their own failure in their lives they have not been able to hold on like abraham head on to the promise they have not been able to trust god for deliverance from habits failures have overwhelmed them he says why there is nothing to this message because i mean we've been following this thing and this thing is still happening in my life it is your problem it is not the word of god problem it's not the message problem it's your individual problem praise the lord what do you think god gave us 1 000 years of melania so we can catch up with our friendship so we can catch up with our friendship before we go to eternity praise the lord because some of us will never we'll never meet up we stay behind we are still slow and i'm not so sure i got to be careful god will give you one one thousand years sit on this bound you don't have to be careful in the millennium let me warn you before we get there praise the lord one thousand years you are free to catch up even the fool when i heard that's what isaiah said the fool were not earth so you have 1 000 years to catch up with your friendship that's how how important friendship is oh my praise the lord what was the time it's almost time ah my just catching up with this thought here praise the lord amen but it's a very very important important relationship very important relationship it's in john chapter 15. let's just take one year and then i find a place to close i know all my friends are saying you should have talked a little bit on that courtship and detain you should have talked a little bit praise the lord amen don't worry i will talk a little bit on that are we together you love the lord amen what a wonderful father we serve he's a wonderful wonderful savior praise the lord amen now you see jesus year john chapter 14 15 he was he was coming to the end of his ministry jesus from the beginning of his ministry started dealing with these guys calling them matthew john andrews following him after his witness what happened but every one of them were a bit suspicious because they saw this man discerning calling people name philip when i called natanya when he got there jesus told nathaniel all of this they had never seen that before their churches were not teaching those things so they were watching him from afar amen you see that brother branham will demonstrate some of these things and he says uh uh uh jonah uh a simon father would tell his boys when they go to fish and say some one of these days moses said the lord god would raise up a prophet like unto me amen and he will start talking this and and you know uh talking about solomon how he had this great gift in his life you know he can you knew the trust of people and all of these things because those seed were already sold look at the woman at the well she says our our father taught us these things there was a seed that was sold that's why she could say i perceive that you are a prophet but we were told that when the messiah comes these are the things he would do when jesus says i'm heed the sea was already touched amen she has already witnesses i mean she just yeah come and see the man they have told me all the things so jesus from the beginning of his ministry he started he started building a friendship with these with these uh disciples he would take them you know on the side you take them on the mountain take them apart he was doing all of that to build friendship build confidence with him praise the lord he was building friendship relationship that's how friendship builds praise the lord are we together when he when he came to this time of his ministry he told his disciples praise the lord verse 13 sin john 15 he said greater love have no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends you have come to that hour he's communicating with them praise the lord so right there jesus is telling them that he had brought him into a friendship relationship that all of this why that were traveling in the way he was dealing with them he was teaching them he says no these things is not for the public two years this this is for you two year this is greater love i have no man than for the man to lay down his life for his friends praise the lord henceforth i call you not seven for the seven knoweth now what the lord does but i call you friends i'm taking you from judaism i'm taking you from the lord i'm bringing you into a more intimate more closer relationship so god's the way he deal with us is in a progressive relationship when we are born again we are sons and daughters of god but then he teach us by his word he pulled us aside like brother branham said in adoption he will pull this one aside and just give him a little blessing because he have trusted you with few trials in your life and you did not misbehave it says i pull you from the lord children you are no longer sevens brother branham says even isaiah we just read as i refer to them sevens all through the old testament they were all referred to as sevens but jesus is bringing them to a more closer relationship i no longer call you sevens you are my friends you are my friends in john chapter 20 after he he after the resurrection he says now you are breadwins oh my goodness henceforth i i i call you now seven for the seven no and now what the lord does but i call you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i made it known unto you the same i am that made abraham there is nothing i will hide from abraham everything i have heard of the father that that is that that area of trust that's what god wants you to trust him it's the relationship of friendship you are a son of god you will never lose your salvation but you see if you don't come into a friendship relationship with god you you can live an honor privilege christian life because you are not afraid so the devil will take your mistakes and whip you and then and then you come here you confess and and then then you're another day you are in and already you are out because you have not stepped into a friendship right you are not afraid you are just a seven you come wednesday night you sing you serve god sunday morning you do your service to god you are just a seven oh our church said we must not do this oh the message said we must not do that oh that mess you are not a friend you are not a friend i'm not talking about a bride now i'm talking about a friend because that's another level of relationship i'm talking about frame that's the reason why we are not enjoying our marriage relationship we have been brought into a union with christ we are not enjoying it because we have not had this friendship with him we have not had the friendship with the one that we love you are not enjoying your relationship as a son with the father you know he is your father no doubt you know that he's your father but there is something that is lacking friendship if friendship is not there you will not enjoy the relationship of father and son if friendship is not it's not there you will not enjoy a bright and bright room relationship there is no formal relationship you will enjoy if you don't have friendship praise the lord the preacher can come on the pulpit he can bless you he can i mean the preacher preached he preached by inspiration and he says i know that me he was talking to him when he didn't recall your name those days the brother that was preaching to us when we came into faith he will call you by name and ask you to stand up so that one pound everybody know that you okay coming your way praise the lord amen but you see even if the preacher called your name or he don't call your name if that level of friendship is there you know that he's not attacking you to hurt you he never spent the whole night up praying just to come and attack you just to come and hurt you or just to come and embarrass you because love is corrective that's the reason why that friendship has to be there it has to be praise the lord we can go on and go on but the time will not allow us tonight so if the lord willing we we can get back to this or maybe the law might china us into something but you think about it think about how friendship is very important in all your forms of relationship for you to get the best out of faith you have to be your friend you have to be afraid musicians you can come forward tonight what a friend we have in jesus let you sing there tonight [Music] brother branham said in the message the weight of a true prophet he says but the word of god will endure forever upon the rock i will build
