can gather here once again into your divine presence oh god what a privilege it is so god for us to be here yes because the psalmist said i was glad when they said unto me come let us go into the house of the lord father we are glad to be here this morning because in your presence of god the sick i may hold in your presence lord the weak are made strong in your presence so god's sinner comes to repentance so father and lord this morning we have gathered here for one purpose and that is to come and worship you oh god lord i believe every person here this morning has a need of god and we

[Music] [Applause] all right can you please um sit while we call on brother dan for a testimony brother then you are welcome praise the lord god bless your sins um i just want to give a testimony to the glory of god and uh for me to be here this morning is purely the grace of god amen i wouldn't probably have been able to make it in and if i did at all i probably would have come in either in clutches or in a wheelchair on friday morning i went to work and i was asked to put one machine together and there is um [Music] an infeed to that machine which weighs between 75 and 80 pounds so i picked it up normally we use a hoist to raise it up but i was so much enhanced and that is how i've been doing it for the past four five years i lifted it and i put it on the platform the platform is about about this high and that is what i've always done and it was secure and i stood there for probably between 30 and 45 minutes with my back tent and i was scared in front and i tried to take this kid out of the way as soon as i took the skate and i took one two my third step i had a big bang behind me and when i turned that massive medal how it felt i don't know now brother johnny will bear me witness the whole floor is just nothing but still and concrete sometimes something would fall on another floor and you hear it you go there you don't see a dent but this one fell and left a mark on the concrete floor and i just started wondering how it felt and it just didn't fall i know when something falls it just probably i left it here and the thing came and landed here if there was somebody on the platform i would say maybe they lifted it and threw it against me which i have no cause to believe anybody anybody would do that and i saw the hand of god first hand because for that while i was standing there and i believe with all my heart if i had stood there for another ten five minutes that thing wouldn't fall because there was a hand that was holding it and so long as i was there it was not going to come down amen but as soon as i moved that thing it literally jumped it didn't fall it jumped and i was wondering if it had landed on my legs it would break it if it was on my back i was going to end up in a wheelchair there was no doubt because the tin is heavy we had to call a mechanic i called my manager and my supervisor they came over and they had to call a mechanic to come and stretch it bent that's infield bent they had to straighten it to be able to get it to fit in and the concrete floor left a mark so i was wondering what would happen to my body and you know shortly before that happened normally we have a little meeting in the morning and i raised the concerns and my manager just told me right up front that done it was god testing your patience your god was testing your patience and i just got stuck in my seat yeah i didn't say anything anymore it was the same manager again something happened about six months ago and when i was talking about it he said dan i don't know what to tell you but your god was with and you was wondering what was he going to say this time if this thing had fallen on me where was his god and that thing happened but praise be to god that he realized where my god was and i just want to give god the glory this morning amen it's together for jesus oh yes he is worthy to be praised amen all right let's go ahead and stand and let's worship god amen you step down open my eyes let me see [Music] beauty our lives [Music] here i am to see all together [Music] days [Music] here [Music] all together i'll never [Music] upon a to

the lord amen amen amen romans chapter 9 this morning now we want to thank the lord and all of his goodness and uh there's been a lot of a lot of questions uh uh from many believers you know asking whether the believers over there in afghanistan with everything that is happening in that part of the world and then just uh late yesterday evening we got a text from brother francois lepica over in switzerland and he attached that there are some believers that are there and he's in contact with with a brother that was mentioning from turkey over there to to afghanistan and uh i think a couple close to 100 believers that are dead and and they are all caught into their situation praise the lord amen so i mean whether they are believers there or not they are people that needs prayer amen amen praise the lord romans chapter 9 praise the lord let's let's look here in romans chapter 9 now and i want to find a good place here to stand in every part of this chapter is so good that it's hard to find a place to stay at but i will read from verse 8 romans chapter 9 verse 8 that is their which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed i want us to underline that word deceit the children of the promise accounted for the sea for this is the word of promise at this time i will come and sarah shall have a son and and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil nothing they have done we were looking at full knowledge that it is not attached to what you will do nothing they have done what a good or evil that the purpose of god i call into election my stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the other shall save the younger as it is written jacob have our love but easter have i hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god let the church of the living god answer god forbid let's pray amen dear father the father of life yes we thank you this morning yes we want to pray and ask your blessings upon your word oh god we just asked our father lord you will come open your word to us come out of the pages of the bible father and we just ask the lord god that will be losing this morning lord father oh god made the world that has the power lord or father god to free us from the lord of sin and death come and have your liberty this morning we just pray father lord and that god you will bring conviction to our hearts oh lord and be with us this morning we love you father we love you if we say we love you lord we really do oh god blessed be your name now in jesus name amen the lord bless you you may have your seat now now we started looking at this subject from wednesday night uh uh a little bit there on the birthright uh and we want to look we want to look back into that this uh this morning we uh trying to look at the right that the believers have amen and and how we obtain these rights the rights that the believers have and how we obtain this right now when you read the scripture year paul says here for it was said unto her that's rebecca and the elder shall save the younger then he said as it is written jacob i love in esau i hate genesis chapter 25 because when you go to genesis chapter 25 you will never see where uh the scripture says jacob i love esau i hate but yeah the apostle paul taking that uh right there in the scripture and he's he's tying something he's he's actually dealing with something here uh uh that we want to study it a little bit amen because if you if you just look at that you you might uh stumbled a little bit and and with all of these people that that keeps arguing about what they don't know about you know what what a prophet is praise the lord amen i was listening to uh god's prophet yesterday and he said uh something that just so blessed me as simple as it sounds and uh but you notice it's at a place where you are just thinking about something and then it comes through the wording and then you just feel so blessed about it he says the same gift that preached the word is the same gift that discern the house of the people amen praise the lord hallelujah and he says and then if you call me the prophet and then you say my teaching is wrong but my gift is right he says you don't know what a prophet is amen praise the lord genesis chapter 25 we would like to look here back into the story of uh isaac and rebecca uh easter and jacob let's draw back a little bit here and verse 19 and these are the generations of isaac abraham's son i abraham beget isaac and isaac was 40 years or when he took rebecca to wife the daughter of betel the syrian of padan aram the sister of laban the syrian and isaac entreated the lord for his wife when i was studying this there was there was an information that uh that that i came came across and it was so blessed i kind of for bless my heart you know uh and a historian was looking at this thought isaac entreated his wife you know because she was barren and the lord and the law was entreated of him and rebecca his wife conceived and and and what uh uh the talk that was that was kind of edifying to me was that uh isaac took his wife back to the same mountain where abraham moriah's where abraham was going to sacrifice him and and and history says there were he entreated the lord praise the lord you can you can just see the the the level of inspiration that is in there i mean my mind was just blown my head my head swirled on my head if my hair looking big this morning then you have seen it it is from the effect of that praise the lord amen you know that it's an art of inspiration it's not written in the book it's something that drops in your heart amen it's something that drops in your heart and and you just do it you don't care you're not looking for the result but you just do it i mean to to to bring his wife to that very same spot and say lord god this was the place where my daddy tied me and offered me as a sacrifice unto you oh what an inspiration oh my goodness i can just stay on there this morning what an inspiration and isaac entreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was entreated of him and rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so and she went an inquirer of the lord do you see the effect of what isaac did upon his wife he went and he treated the lord for his wife and and the lord visited his wife now she having her own a personal struggle she went back to the same god that that isaac prato she never went back to her husband and says what is happening to me the bible says she went back to the lord and said lord what is this because she's now honor the effect to know that it was because isaac entreated the lord she knows that that is the reason why god visited her praise the lord so whatever might be happening to her in this season of life god knows about it praise the lord amen are we together praise the lord amen and the law said unto her two nations are in that womb and two mana of people shall be separated from that but i hope you ate something this morning praise the lord i hope you're praise the lord amen because i don't know when we're going to be finished that's what i said is amen amen so she's here the lord said two nations are in that warm two minor of people shall be separated from thee now i i kind of stopped here because i want to i want i want to follow some thoughts that that that i wrote down uh and so i would not i would not be all over the place you know i end up all over the place anyway and uh and you've been very gracious to to bear with my mind of preaching that is very disorder but uh you know like i always said it takes a good church to make a good pastor it's how much you bear with him yes amen now uh the lord is telling rebecca here that two nations will be in that womb now when god spoke to abraham god told abraham that he will be the father of missions yes praise the lord he will be the father of nations so we know it's many nations and then when god come here dealing with isaac and his wife he narrow it down to two nations praise the lord when god will go to jacob he will narrow it down to 12 tribes so keep that in the back of your mind because we will go back to it praise the lord amen you see how uh uh and you watch this other principle in the scripture jesus when he when he taught on his parables he was says the lord of the harvest or the master of the house he came and he gives some sister fourth and some 84th and some hundredfold so the principle there is that it is always increasing is always getting better praise the lord the principle here is that god is narrowing his promise down he promised abraham to be the father of nations amen when it comes to isaac he said two nations are in that womb when it comes to jacob it became 12 tribes are we together whether it means anything to you just hold that brother brandon would say put it under the fifth rape you might need it in your journey praise the lord let's continue to go here he says and the lord said unto her two nations are in the womb two and two modern of people shall be separated from their boss and and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the other shall save the younger praise the lord and and and when her days to be delivered was fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb now paul in romans that we read romans chapter 9 paul is referring to this this is the particular verse that paul is referring to and the law said unto her two nations shall be in the womb and the other shall save the younger and when her days were fulfilled when her days to be delivered was fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first came out red now what what i want you to to to see here is that there is no record yet in genesis chapter 25 where the bible says jacob i love and ease or i hate it's in the scripture but it's not here in genesis chapter 25. but yes paul being the prophet he's taking the word amen now let's go back to romans chapter nine let's pick up that verse again verse 12 and it was said unto her and it was said unto her the other shall self the younger as it is written jacob i love but issa i hate so what paul is doing here as it was said unto her that's the spoken word as it is written that's the written word praise the lord you know a lot of these little things just entreats me you know you i mean you you you you just your mind get caught up in it and then and then sometimes you ruin your whole time aesthetic because you just get stuck to see how beautiful the scripture is praise the lord amen so there is nowhere yet in genesis chapter 25 where jacob i love israel i hate will come up is in the book of malachi so paul was dealing with genesis to malachi are we together amen but the same law god that said the elder shall save the lord the younger i don't believe that it was it was it was a slip of mind that god couldn't say that a jacob loved israel ahead it was not a slip of mind it was not a slip of tongue that god couldn't say it yet to rebecca but it shows how the mind of god the thoughts of god are progressive praise the lord amen if god like he says unto us you know there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle that was a thought that he taught from the foundation of the world but that talk is progressive the people that would believe that word you know that and and and i would want to go in the rapture that would want to go in the body change it would take a lot of things for your body to change it will take some hard things now whether you really want to choose what i want this body change or let me just die that's the reason why the thoughts of god are seed they are seed and everything that the tree holds you see this this this uh old tree i don't even know what tree it is standing beside the building here uh with all of his branches almost getting dry came from a single seed let's travel and the first came out and the first came out red all over like a haired garment and they called his name ether and after that came his brother out in in his name and i mean in his hand took a hold of or heed and his name was called jacob the the jews would say jacob hakap that's a way to pronounce it i have not done my tongue surgery yet so i can't even pronounce my own name right and after that came his brother had his brother heed and they caught his name jacob and isaac was three school years old when she begged them praise the lord amen three school years which was uh 60 years am i right three scores should be 16. verse 20 says and isaac was 40 years when he took rebecca so he had to wait for the promise how many years 20 years and the boys grew and isa was a coney hunter a man of the field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents that also has a hidden meaning and i mean it's so it's so beautiful when you look at it through the word i mean it's just so beautiful jacob being the play man and he'd word intense he was a shepherd he was a shepherd now the the work of a shepherd was the bible says to the egyptians it was an abomination but to the hebrews the work of a shepherd for a son because their their inheritance were in katos that's where their riches were that's the reason why david said the lord had ten thousand cars on the hill just to be able to express god's wealth so to the hebrews a shepherd was one of the most trusted work for a father to take a a son and set him over the family inheritance that was the family inheritance a man in those days uh uh was was counted a wealthy man by his flocks flocks of sheeps or flocks of golden and and then and and the amount of hurts that he had so uh uh uh you know uh in one sense you will look at it as uh those days you can look at a shepherd as a lazy man all you have to do is lay down in a tent you know yeah lay down there and the sheep be eating so in another sense it was a it was a color job okay it was a color job a play man all you have to do i mean you you don't have to be telling the ground and you know you don't have to be you know running after no just create your sound come on come on so it was a cow turn job that's why they call him a plane [Laughter] oh man praise the lord amen [Laughter] uh oh man isa was a corny hunter a man of the field a white man he was a wide man he was a brave man praise the lord but jacob was a plain man dwelling intent praise the lord say he's a lazy man he's just like off his job with air condition on let me get on the workers this morning a little bit praise the lord uh uh i'm taking my time because i want you to digest this i want you to i want you to start reading between the lines because they are just a lot of things right in that little nugget of the scripture amen there's just a lot of things in there in that little noggin of the scripture because you find the same thing with uh with with king and ibel okay king king is born and he have a desire to be a farmer to till the ground and let and yes yes abel year he's he's driving to be a shepherd boy amen now the thing about it there is that brother branham who says i think even made clear by prophecies that uh uh that that even the the gift of a man is tied to his nature amen that the gift of a man is tied to his nature i mean a man cannot be uh uh uh uh an evangelist and and and i mean he's he's as quiet and slow like me that's too contrary nature i mean that's too contrary nature so the the the line of thought here is the other if uh if if abel choose the career if he if he was driving something in him was driving him to be a shepherd ball and and and it is the the the family inheritance is is is there in in shepherds it's not in the field it's not in the plants it's it's right there what was it that created that desire the same thing here with isa and jacob he's a born and and and and he being you know uh a wide man and he's he's in the field and doing all of that but here is jacob here born in his desire his driving ambitions is to be able to take care of the family inheritance which of course by law must go toward the first born am i confusing you are you lost in the conversation praise the lord so what i'm trying to establish here is that there is an intelligence there is a divine intelligence that is placing that is placing each of these sounds that they are not they are not even in control of it that divine intelligence that wrote their dna and put right in their dna they kind of for nature the kind of a gift that they will have praise the lord now you have to keep on the back of your mind now we've been talking about full knowledge so i wanted us i wanted you to grab that as we go along and isaac love easer because he did eat off his venison but jacob loved i mean rebecca loved jacob praise the lord we read from left to right i'm reading from right to left now here the scripture will be able to expose one of uh mankind problem family line where it's it exposed something here in the patriots that even in their family you know there was some sense of favoritising which of course parental favoritism to the children it has a way of of bringing him praise the lord amen sometimes sometimes you know uh it's easy for people to be out of the out of the fence and look in the fence and says well i think i think yeah i think he loved this child more than that child in that child more than their child okay and uh but you you will see that you know uh uh a right through the the first family god expressing his love never show favoritising to his children praise the lord when he came down he made provision both for adam and eve yes the lamb that was slain on the east side of eden was enough to cover both of them praise the lord amen but what we we see in abraham family we can see a little bit of that but there was something that abraham possessed that that the high god to look above all of that and what abraham possessed genesis recalled is that he will be able to teach his children whatever god shows him whatever god revealed to him he will be able to pass it down to his children praise the lord it was one of the things that created a very great friendship with with god and abraham because uh uh uh you know uh uh god he's not a gossiper you know gossiper will always see he at gossip where we say this is between me and you they will even forget that god is listening this is between me and you just me and you but god is not a gossiper you know for so when he recognized that the the the fat the ability in abraham to be able to pass on whatever he he taught him or whatever he revealed to him and that is the secret to be able to receive from god to receive from god is to also have the ability to share amen praise the lord is to have the ability to share if you cannot share god can i give you more praise the lord amen so we see here but we can also see that there were there were some things that is that that you know that that contribute to dice one of the things i would think that contribute to it the bible says right here that uh because isaac loved the venison that isa was bringing him it was not it was not just the venison you know but it was more for the fact that this was his firstborn son and and for the fact that the firstborn son was now paying attention because because you have to understand adoption you know the father is looking for this boy that that that that is able to show an ability of governing so for the fact that isa now was paying attention to his dad he goes out and and and just from a little boy you know he goes and hun and pretty soon as now he comes his first mate the first person he thinks about is his dad so that attracts the father because he's the firstborn and and and and and and he's playing uh uh uh a certain role of responsibility to the father praise the lord now but rebecca on her side was what the injured of the lord told her praise the lord she's she's hiding that thing in her heart because she knows what the law says there is there is no there is no way now she can start to push this thing in in isaac house and says uh you know i mean uh the law already told me that the younger one was said that the older one so i don't care what you're doing and this is that is just going to divide the family so being a woman she held that in her heart and she started watching that younger one keeping her eyes on him praise the lord and jacob saw partage and isa came from the field and he was fainting jesus said unto jacob femi i prayed him with the same real partage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom and jacob said sell me this day that breath right praise the lord amen amen tell me this day that breath right now as we were reading you know read some quotes here we'll realize that you know brother brandon says all he wanted was the birthright now the thing about it there is that uh for you to pause and think about is that what in him created that desire destiny what created that desire i mean it was easy for him to say well i gave you venison i mean i gave you protest you gave me the venison you know the venison you cook for for for daddy give me a good part of it and i gave you some of mine but why so soon what inside of him is driving him to the breath right it's not his choice it's a divine command it's a divine decreed it was not your choice amen amen we try to make this thing order by ourself and jesus said behold i'm at a point to die and what what it shall this breath right do to me and jacob says word to me in this day and he swore unto him and he sold his birthright onto jacob then then jacob gave ease of bread and pottage of blingtail and he did eat and drunk and rose up and went his way he did eat and drunk and rose up you know jesus pick up their attitude of of the people in the days of noah eating and drinking rising up to plane amen god there with the children of israel when they were called to the moabites and they got into that feast of bioporo eating and drinking there there is there is there is a scriptural sense that goes with that amen the scriptural sense that goes with that is the other is it's a careless attitude praise the lord it's a careless attitude and and a selfish one that shows where people are they just they are just all about himself well i don't care for anybody i just want to do me the people ate they drunk and they rose up to play there is something about that attitude that god frowns on praise the lord it's an attitude where the people go by oh all they are about is us i mean we can bring it right down to our dating age amen all that they are about it's just uh uh i mean about themselves that's what they're about it's all about himself the people that are going with how they are they're not even having god on their mind they're not even they're not even thinking about him they have no no concern about the lord nothing they are all orders just themselves praise the lord the bible says and he did eat and he drank and he rose up and went his way now see there now that attitude of just eating drinking going about just yourself just dust means there by doing that he despised his breath right does by doing that by having that kind of attitude of not even considering god in your steps in your choices in your meaning your second your hour he can he he was ready to do whatever he wanted to do just to get his fleshly desire satisfied he can work overtime just to get his fleshly desire satisfied thus he despised his breath right oh i'm praying this morning that the holy spirit will just speak audibly to your heart thus he despised his breath right when he despised his birthright he didn't fall on the ground and die when he despised his birthright he never got cancer he was still a strong man that could go out and do what he wanted to do praise the lord you know you think about this and you think about people you know blasphemy and they are saying all sorts of things about christ and god and you know and about about god's word of the hour and and the prophet of the hour and sometimes you know uh uh we turn to being like uh the sons of thunders and you just think well fire can't come down and consume them you know there's a biblical principle jesus in in a word says that uh in that day you know anything that is said again the son of man will not be forgiving jesus did not say if you say anything against the son of man when he's working in his church i will strike you to death praise the lord amen so sometimes you find people trying to look for vindication they says well if i'm if i'm not a if i'm not a servant of god let god strike me to there is nowhere in the scripture where god said he will strike you today but he said if you blaspheme it will not be forgiving you in this word or the word to come so you will go on prospering you will be healthy you will get rich but it will not be forgiving you and people can make those kind of for authoritative statement if i'm wrong let god struck me to death and everybody looking at him okay god struck him today now and when he when he stayed moving on the man was right the man was right almighty god is not your toy god is not your playboy praise the lord he says anything said against the son of man will be forgiven but when the holy spirit will come in this church one word said against it will not be forgiving do you see why many would turn up and realize that all of this why they've been having unconfessing in their lives you see why brother branham said unconfessed sin can make this church to fail because people can sit right in their seats and they know how to throw hinge they know how to challenge you in their mind without saying the word the easy thing to do if you have a problem just write it down after the service meet the brother meet the preacher you say this you know can you clarify it that's right amen because the holy spirit can be driving a man to deal with certain things and a man can say something boring in that channel and you now with the message book in your head you can be able to line up all the cuts where he's out of order you just think about all the people that can get on the internet and and saying all of these things and yet their heart is still beating in their chest they wake up in the morning they don't feel any different so they feel vindicated if i was wrong god would have struck me dead there is nowhere in the scripture but that attitude he despised his birthright he never got sick he never got cancer man he finished eating his stomach was fought on his way he went he went jumping from one tree to another tree from one city to another vacation spot trying to look for a trophy trying to do something to impress his father for all of those times he was walking out of the way of god okay let's get into our scripture this morning now get into our subject this morning the lord will be able to help us here be the name of the lord amen amen on wednesday night talking about this i said that the subject of birthright never came up in the first twins kingdom and because we know they were of they were of separate fathers praise the lord that's the reason why birthright was not an it was not a subject but you will realize that there is a mystery of the first twins and the second twins praise the lord the mystery of the first twins is two seed planted in the same womb two seed planted in the same earth praise the lord the mystery of the second twins oh my goodness oh praise the lord hallelujah oh thank you jesus thank you jesus the mystery of the second twins is two seed coming from the same one am i saying the same thing praise the lord amen the mystery of the first twins is two seed planted in the same earth praise the lord two seed let me go a little bit further amen that i won't confuse you two seed from two different planters planted in the same earth the mixture of the second twins is two seed from one planter coming out of the same earth [Music] praise the lord now you will see why jesus when he taught matthew chapter 13 he says these are mysteries these are mysteries secret hidden from the foundation of the word and when jesus was talking about matthew chapter 13 he was talking about the soul went out to soul praise the lord and then in another parable that is tied to that he said there was one sower that came in a night and saw the turs and the owner of the field came and he saw the seed and the both of them grew together and when that when when the liberals of the field started they said whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what's going on here he said leave it leave it let them grow together yes so we have something here that is plain out in scripture but then we know that is god bringing out his great mystery from his mind praise the lord that's the reason why uh uh uh uh king and evil's will be uh uh uh the the subject the subject of separate sea will be the subject of argument but yet it is one of the subject that will always grab the illege it will always grab the illeg when you come on the subject of serpent seed sometimes great theologians well my little uh uh research i like i like to look into what people think about setting subject and you find men that are i mean they they are they are scalars they are scalars that i mean there's uh there is a guide i like to to look into a commentary from from one adam i mean he's a he's uh uh he's he's a scalar i i like the way he does his research because he and by but yeah there are places where you find that they still struggle with this they still struggle with the understanding on trinity praise the lord i mean in as much as the the the illite they rejoice over this but even this very same subject it captured other people into the ranks of the message that are still not illeg they see it wow it brings them in because they need to be there to create problems for us when you preach separate see they are on your feet [Applause] the mess freedom is when you start identifying the character racist of the serpency then he said you're preaching to them praise the lord so we see two seeds in genesis beginning that is planted in the same earth but as you progress we see one seed planted in two different characteristics coming out praise the lord i can hold you the whole morning on that thought spare bound and we can run it through the scripture and you will see that god's word is perfect in every way i'll spare you some time the the two seeds that were planted in the beginning [Music] from two different planters praise the lord from two different planters that's the seventh seed and the original seed spoken word is the original sea there was a sea that god said every sea will bring four of its kind but there was a serpent sea that was planted also in the same field praise the lord amen [Music] and and brought forth two with different characteristics but what you will realize here is the acceptancy verb says this body of yours is breathing between the serpent and eve our sinful nature is breathing between the serpent your anger is a breed between uh the serpent and eve that's where you got it from it's not from god even when when elisha called the bed on those children it was not from god it was something that was breeded between the serpent and he that anger but yet god honor it now we will realize that as time progressed after the flood a new covenant a new covenant has been made through the fire our father abraham but you see the the the two seeds that were planted in the beginning uh uh uh uh the the the seed of the second was not destroyed the seed of the serpent came through the fl came through the flood it survived the floor they came on the other side we see neram growing up to be a man of defined when the bible say he was a mighty hunter it means that he was a man that was defined against anything called god praise the lord so now god that's the reason why when when paul speaks here in romans he talks about the children of the promise that goes back to the seed praise the lord god is now going to show how on a new covenant from the same father two seas will come out of the womb one that would be athlete and the other one will be spiritual are we together amen am i being too loud am i yelling at you praise the lord amen because we we we have to understand you know better brandon would travel like this and tell us a masterpiece how when the image of god god image that he built in in the garden of eden was thrown down by unbelief god started to build a new image from the new covenant and he had to build four principal cornerstones the first cornerstone was abraham by faith god was going to sto to establish a soviet uh foundation by faith in a man called abraham praise the lord and then when he moved on to isaac he will be the man of love all the greatest romance story of isaac waiting in the field and rebecca coming on on on the camera god will establish a foundation of love unconditional love praise the lord then he will establish in isaac and then when it comes to jacob he will be the cornerstone of grace [Laughter] he will be god is laying a cornerstone because he's going to build another masterpiece on this cornerstone that would never been thrown down that no matter what unbelief comes what a doctorate system comes and all the forced doctrine it would never true god caused i mean uh masterpiece down this other masterpiece that he's building on this full sonic foundation and jake and joseph will be the cornerstone of perfection so god have one faith isaac love jacob grace joseph perfection and on this he obey the patriots the prophets the kings then he comes to the church the bride right into the rapture praise the lord are we together so right in here we can see that even when the floor came and man became wicked and god the straw man of the wickedness but there was a blending already there was a mixing a mix in between the serpent seed there was a blood a mix of blood amen that was already going to travel down through the age are we together so god here now under his foundation of grace he's bringing out a mystery that his people would catch in the last day that was the reason why paul went back to that rebecca says what did what is thus a type of the church experiencing two seeds honor that brother branham says every revival produced at twins she's feeling this in her womb now they are of the same father now if they were a different father you can say yeah they want a separate the king's children oh this other one here is able children but now they are of the same father how are we going to tell how are we now going to distinguish praise the lord glory be to god amen that's the reason why the race is not to the swift but he that endureth to the end amen shall be saved praise the lord amen are we together let's look at some scriptures here on the subject like i told you i'm always all over the place amen let's look at a little bit some scriptures here on the subject of uh of uh uh birthright uh uh uh oh praise the lord what are we talking here now first born breath right [Music] and first lane let's go to the scriptures a little bit and we'll be able to see some things here out of the scripture amen exeter exeter now now in in in genesis which is the seed chapter uh uh we we're looking at you know god dealing with uh birthright there but that is not the first scripture where god actually talked about the firstborn but to actually be with the birthright that was the first time he came out there so let's go to exodus 13. praise the lord exodus chapter 13 let's go and uh we'll travel quick here essential chapter 13 we will read from verse 11 praise the lord amen they say hallelujah corner down there the gift is in the church we cannot accept it until there is an interpreter praise the lord verse 11 and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee out bring thee into the land of canaan as his word unto deed and to thy fathers and shall give it thee that thou shalt be set apart unto the lord and thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix and every first link so the first bone is also called the first lane that cometh of a beast which they have the male shall be the laws amen and every first lane of an ass thou shall redeem wave elam this is very very beautiful praise the lord let me let me share something with you quickly here this this week this would really help me uh praise the lord amen are we together glory glory be to god let's read lord in the lord having a shadow let's read that quote from the law having a shout out brother ben says yeah he says just like honor the old lord if if a little say the mother hers gave birth to to a little baby meal down there and the little fellow was born with his ears broke down cross eyed knock knees what a horrible looking creature any one year that ever plowed knows what what a broken arrow meal is see oh he's no good for nothing i mean if he get a knock knees high is he going to pull that thing he'll be falling down all in the field he's not good for nothing and and you will look at him and say well if the fellow could see and understand he did look and say well it won't be long they would never feed me the master of the place here comes i'll find me he he will just knock knock me in the head and throw me over the ditch why because he's born with all this uh disability knock knees cross out and you know his tongue hanging out praise the lord not good for anything because i will never be no use look at me i i'm not good at all look at my my my ears i've broken down my eyes crossed my knees knocked together i can't even walk straight i'm a horrible person but if the mother is rightly instructed i love that if the mother is rightly instructed if she's now feeding off of facebook but she's feeding off of the book of life she will say but wait a minute son let me tell you something the priests will never see you by the man of the house when he comes out this morning and see you were born under a breath right because that little hearse in that horrible condition is the first child of that mother is the first that broke the matrix so because he's the first he's born under the law of the birthright that require him to be redeemed amen oh praise the lord amen hallelujah glory be to god amen you appreciate this when you when you find your place amen you appreciate it when you when you realize i don't know what position the new birth is amen when you understand why the holy ghost is important the priest will never see you the man of the house when he come out in the morning and see you were born on a breath right you are the first one you have a birthright so the master will have to go and get a lamb that will have to be examined don't worry boy the priest is not going to see you the master of the house will have to go and get a lamb that will be a zombie and that lamb has to be more prettier than you no blemish not a crippled lamb nor cross eyed that's right oh praise the lord oh thank you jesus who has wanted to take the book and to lose the sills thereof john went because no man was walter every man no matter how he was born either his hair was crooked or his eyes or his nose every man came with a crooked spot in his life but don't worry because the worshiper is never on an examination the worshiper is never on an examination praise the lord so if you are still dealing with complex you better go and find your lamb praise the lord if you are still dealing with complex comparing yourself to people want to look like this person and want to look like this person is because you you have not found a lamb yet to represent you you don't know your place in the birth line but a man or a woman that know their place in the birth line they have experienced a new birth and knows that the holy ghost make them accepted in their beloved [Music] does not go with complex you can say what you want to say but i know that i'm accepted in the beloved and that's what matters you can continue with your gossiping maybe that's what you are good for if your own mother is rightly instructed she would say you were born under the birthright you are the first you have a birthright so the master will go and get a lamb and we have it to be a zombie by the priest without blemish yes and he will have to die in your place praise the lord oh my see that little crooked donkey chunkiness the lord amen hallelujah hey man well i really thought some people dealing with complex will bust out of their seat jump out and praise god because you have never been on an examination he hath made you accepted in the beloved praise the lord hallelujah amen he would get along with our blemish and he will have to die in your place so you can live and the little fellow mind he will kick up his knock knees and run and have a big time praise the lord he's never going to see him the priest isn't going to see him the priest is going to examine the lamb now that's what paul i mean uh uh uh the scripture was dealing with here we were just reading in in exodus chapter 13. let's get back to our scripture here because we have a little more to cover amen verse 13 in every first line of anas thou shalt redeem with elam and if and if thou will not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of man among the children shall doubt redeem now so this also established a principle here that there are some first link that will be redeemed and there are some first lane if you don't want to redeem it you just break the neck praise the lord amen you just break the neck because it will prove to you over in uh help me now genesis chapter 38 let's go back to genesis chapter 38 praise the lord genesis chapter 38 amen let's read verse 7. i think the people back there can get it to it faster than me tell it verse seven the bible says and earth judah firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him so now because you are the firstborn you have the right to leave so god is saying the first born of an ass if if you don't want it if it's too ugly for you to bear it then just break the neck because almighty god will do the same here he was the firstborn of judah but he was wicked [Music] i mean for him to for him for god to just just kill him without giving us a reason shows that he have such weakness in his heart and there are people like that never want good for another person and all the good for themselves they can never appreciate never be satisfied wickedness is just in the car of their blood that's right he was a firstborn but god broke his neck praise the lord leviticus chapter 27 verse 26 [Music] leviticus 27 26. praise the lord are we together only in the first lane of the beast's wish should be the law's first name no man no man shall sanctify it whether ebox or sheep it is the laws numbers 18. now one of the things that you can you can also appreciate in this is that you see how god is taking this subject in a progressive way praise the lord he's taking the subject in a progressive way why because it's his internal thoughts [Music] so he keep saying the same thing but every time he says it he brings more information every time he goes back to the same subject he brings more information numbers chapter 18 verse 14. everything devoted in israel shall be down everything that openeth the matrix of all flesh which they bring unto the lord whether it be man or beast shah shall be down nevertheless the firstborn of man shall they are surely redeemed and the first lane of unclean beasts shall they are redeemed praise the lord amen now but let's go back let's go back again a little bit here to number three that's that's where i wanted to get a uh okay i know why i read that because i had it in a sequence of showing the progression in every but i think i'm i'm losing time here number three numbers three twelve numbers 3 12 which shows right here 11 and the law speaks unto moses saying and i behold i have taken the levite from among the children of israel carried the baby in the cry room now oh as you want every one of us to play with her i have taken the levite from among the children of israel instead of the first born that opened it the matrix among the children of israel therefore the levites shall be mine praise the lord now god year first it was the first born there in in in exodus chapter chapter 13 we did not read everything but we all know the story because he said establish this among the people and remind them that because i saved the first born in egypt that's the reason why are requiring all the first born so now uh he's requiring the first bond of man in the first born of beast but as as it progressed we see that now god is going to take a people he's going to take a people yes praise the lord so look at the progression even in creation let there be light let there be water divide from the land let there be fishes let it be animal but when it came to the end he created a man in his image so you see the progression every time god progressed in his word when he gave he gave a statue or a command it's pointing to men praise the lord when he gave the sabbath as a rest as a statue that people observe it but jesus come and say come unto me all you the labor and heavy lady and i will give you rest praise the lord so god interests in in the person god interest in a man is more than the heart that he will or the belt that he wear or the shoes that is on his feet his interest in you as a being it's more than you working at four o'clock in the morning or three o'clock or seven o'clock or i mean you whatever you do his interest his focus is to the man it's to the being then more than your arts and your days are we together so he progressed here with the thought let's go to verse 40 of the scene chapter 3. he goes along and now he's saying and and the lord said unto moses normal all the firstborn of nailed of the children of israel from from a month old and up wall and take the numbers of their names and thou shalt take the levites for me i am the lord instead of the first born now so god was dealing with firstborn now he's taking the levite and as you read down the scripture he's going to say all the first born of katos now must be redeemed by money and giving to the levite so you see the progression of thought yes amen the progression of thought the katos of the levites instead of the first lane among the cattles of the turin of israel and moses number as the lord commanded him all the first born among the turin of israel you go back in this and just read on that you see you see how the progression of the thought is you know the progression of the thought agent and and and all of this is right on the uh the tournament chapter 15 verse 19 you also read about the first thing and uh kind of for losing time here so uh uh let's uh let's just travel praise the lord amen amen now another thing there is that uh uh you also learn to appreciate how the children of israel how they had this ordinance even though they were used in shadow but yet it was so important to them so much important to them let's let's look at the scripture here and genesis chapter 43 genesis chapter 43 genesis chapter 43 verse 33 genesis 43 verse 33 32 and and they sat and it set on him and and it set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because the egyptian might not eat bread with the hebrew hebrews for that is an abomination onto the egyptians now what i want you to see is this and they sat before him the first bone i called into his birthright and the youngest are calling to his youth and the man marvel one at another what is this when when when the sons of jacob came into the hall to sit down they mother because they don't have this order they don't have this discipline the mother at the discipline because when the sons of jacob will sit down they sat down by their breath right now the youngest running to get seat because you want to be in the first road but the youngest stood up reuben had his seat and the first one next to reuben have his seat and the next one took his seat you can see how the birthright explicitly the birthright have to do with placing in position they honest to it they respected it it was part of their lives yes in a in a generation an age where curtis said it's gone this generation don't know courtesy they don't know please they don't know excuse me they don't know thank you no courtesy the bible says the egyptians saw it and the mother wow they did not call their ages they did not say i am the firstborn but in the way that they stood up and one took his position and then the next one came around and took his position and the next one came around and took his position the egyptian's mouth was hanging wow wow even though they could not associate with these hebrews because they were abomination but yet they saw something that they didn't had because for the egyptian ace who you know what you know they bring all the directors in first they bring all the manager in first but these sons of hebrew they were displaying an order a divine other something was driving driving them in a way where they were displaying what was in god's mind the birthright speaks of position it speaks of authority are we together what an asian day that we are living in the birthright it speaks of authority and it gives a man a been superior over the rest of the family another thing that was in the birthright is that it holds a double portion of the parental inheritance so if we will have any inheritance from the father it must come through the birthright there was there was uh uh a peculiar benediction the blessings of the father and another thing that was in the birthright it was the priesthood the priesthood was in the birthright previous to its establishment in the in in the in the leviticus family or in the peri in the uh aaronic priesthood so the birthright that person that was the firstborn was the one that said the blessing let's say that way you know he was he was almost like the priest of the family even before the priesthood it was established by nature it was there so that's the reason why it you know it inspired our heart to see what made king desire or or abel desire to be a shepherd boy that's the reason why his sacrifice was accepted because he was the priest praise the lord and let jacob here with all of uh uh uh uh his supplanting attitude but he's driving in the path of being dweller intense a plain man a shepherd man because it was from his own flock that he killed a sheep for rebecca to dress him up [Music] are we together until the establishment of the aaronic priesthood the firstborn was the head of the family exercising priestly right praise the lord amen and the firstborn also he had the edenic promise of the second bruiser genesis 3 the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent but do you realize that when god tore abraham of his seed what did he said your seed will possess the gates so the possession of the gate is linked to the promise of bruising the serpent head praise the lord so that's the reason why you can find that uh uh uh that that blessing was said to isaac your seed shall possess the get when you go down there to rebecca when her parents were blessing her the same thing was here over her your seat shall possess the gifts why because it's a promise that is tied to the seed of the woman we talking about the birthright let me speed up here i need to close this down praise the lord amen now as we look at this you will see that there's a pattern in scripture there's a pattern in scripture it you know it gets to the place of where when you look at it closely you will see that there there was a divine a divine driving force and an inspiration that was driving the the the patriots it was driving the man of all into this position and it all it always it looks like this thing was bypassing the natural first bone because naturally king was the firstborn of eve he opened the matrix praise the lord but we know that the birthright was given to seth that took the place of israel amen the firstborn of noah was uh jeff but the blessing was given to shame naturally the firstborn of abraham was ishmael praise the lord but isaac was the son of promise isa in this story was the firstborn but we know jacob got the birthright judah or rubin was the firstborn of jacob but the blessing was given to joseph aaron was the firstborn of amram and jacob but moses was giving the birthright moses was put in position he was put in position david was the youngest of all his brothers but he was the one that was brought in position are we together now so when you look at this and and you look at it and and in the line of scripture you realize that it is not just a natural thing because uh uh uh even though the law designed it that way that the first one that opened the matrix but you also see that there is a supernatural effect in it in a sense that or some you know the thing that well yeah you know you know i'm the first born and and and the brains they showed up for that but you realize that god in his infinite wisdom praise the lord amen in his infinite wisdom as well as we just as we look at this let me run through these things quickly so close this bible now amen so we can be able to to see some of these so but we we see here the progression we see the progression and where god progressed to was to have the levites in the place of the first bone first born of man first born of beast everything now is honor the levite are we together so it shows that god in his mind is now choosing a people for his namesake it shows god's choosing people it shows that he has made our priests and kings unto our god are we together but then it's also show how god has taken the the the the the office of the priesthood how he have taken the office of the priesthood and that is the reason why uh you know verb says here he says true sign that is overlooked he said they have got to be right he's talking about the minister because they are standing here holding the highest office that is held in the world a minister a minister and the most truthful and right accurate we must be that way we must depend on god to do it in a trip report he says according to the bible the highest office in the local church is the ender which is the pastor so god now is bringing in a ministry he's bringing in a people that's what brother branham will call the five full ministry god dress way are we together amen let's look at some scriptures here quickly again romans chapter 8 one of our famous scriptures here that will take us back to our subject of full knowledge romans chapter 8 let's read from verse 29 romans 8 29 praise the lord romans 8 29 for whom he did for known he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son and we said that this image is not like you build an image here or you have the person and then you print a picture of them or you make a mult plate of them no this image is an expression jesus christ being the image of god is that he expressed god it's not like he looked like god no he expressed god praise the lord so we see here that those that he foreknew that was in his mind that he predestinated they were to be confirmed they were to be transformed to express christ in their day amen they were supposed to transform their lives for them to express jesus christ in their day they're supposed to be written episode read of all me not only saying i believe the message no you must be an expression of god conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethrens yes [Music] praise the lord amen collusion chapter 1 verse 15. praise the lord are we together jesus took the story of the prodigal son and what he was dealing with there he was also dealing with breath right he was dealing with inheritance he took the story of the prodigal son and he he decided to ask the the the pharisees you know and and deal with them a little bit okay we have the scripture up there i'm spending my bible here talking at the same time losing my thoughts uh verse 15 the bible says who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature jesus is the firstborn of every creature that is the reason why the scripture says by him all things consist because he is the firstborn so in him is the breath right without him nothing was made that is made so you see how we come into position how we come to our rights and benefit is being in him by one spirit we are all baptized into one body that's the reason why we can enjoy this benefit people that are now baptized into the body by the holy ghost they can look at you and think that you are crazy they think that you too much on the extreme praise the lord but we can enjoy this benefit because what he is our firstborn amen amen hallelujah and you see hebrew he brings us in to be what co equal with him [Music] he's not ruling us like other first born would do and tell us i'm your firstborn so everything belongs to me no since you are called equal with me are we together let's look at verse 18 of that same chapter amen verse 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead yes praise the lord oh that's the reason why the resurrection is the hope of the church the resurrection is the thing that draws us every day because he came from the grave we will rise again we will rise above any situation hallelujah because he is the firstborn from the dead and he broke the holes of death from over his people praise the lord amen he's the head of the church hebrew chapter 12 verse 23. have the musicians come up soon here now there there are things i want to go into here i don't i don't think i've gone pretty much through half of my my notes here but that's okay that's okay let's just read this hebrew chapter 2 verse 23 to the general assembly and the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven where in heaven in the mind of god to the church of the first born so you see here he brought it from a natural family told the belongings the herbs and cuddles their fresh fruits from the field and then he took it down to a whole trap of people and now he's bringing it now in a spiritual sense to a church the church of the firstborn praise the lord that's why he says i'll be in my church and the gifts of hell will now prevail against it because this is the church of the firstborn a church that is birthed by the word of god not by the crease of men john said these are the children of god that are not born of flesh or blood but they are born of the seed incorruptible which is the word of god amen are we together verb says here question and answer now what is the birthright is that right he says that's what i'm trying to tell you this holy ghost is your birthright that's your birthright that's your god-given right he says now people will say today i will go to church i'm just as good as the next fellow but me they will add like one of them holy brothers not me you know i i mean they're they're getting the i mean they just want church association they never want to come to the place of breath never want to come to the place or fall surrounding to god they have their own idea of what they think god is and they think god must come down to their to their ideals praise the lord but without the new birth and without the holy ghost you don't have the birthright you can claim all your rights as whatever you want to claim right but this breath ride that we are talking about the one that gave you right to come off the grave the one that gave you right for your body to obey your confession only comes by the sea incorruptible amen are we together he talks about jacob here in receiving rt now we find the birthright means everything to jacob and now he didn't care he didn't care for nothing else but that breath right he didn't care what it would cost him praise the lord you need to find that place that's that's what paul said when he said make your call and your election show you need to find that place with god you need to find a place where you know that you know that you know praise the lord amen i mean that place of god word i mean a person is birthed to the place when you realize that i mean you you cannot live without him there is not a meaning or second of your life without god praise the lord i mean we can find all the reason josephine take that baby in the cry room that's what we have cry room for i mean people would give all reasons and man that knows this your breath right your inheritance is lying in this bible amen praise the lord you find christians that have never been able to read through their bible all of their years of being christian they have never been able to read through this book only pick and choose just like growing to the to the candy store pick a few verses and read that how to do their religion when this book all your all inheritance deliverance and you have no desire to search the scripture never been able to read through the bible all of your years of christianity they say well i try you know i start and something happen you better find out what is happening you better find out what is happening there are some they cannot even find they cannot even count as straight other schedule being in the presence of god this spirit of randomness god is a god of order he's not a random god oh jacob won was the birthright something was driving him praise the lord you know why israel went into captivity for 70 years it was because the despise the sabbath of the lord when god told them to allow the land to rest give the land a sabbath they were breaking the commandment of god so they were not getting the harvest that these two have got every year for that reason why they started tilling the land every year even the seven years they never gave they never honored the sabbath praise the lord that's where our protection is it's in the birthright glory be to god and the new testament church can claim the holy ghost as a sabbath and yet that holy ghost can take the desire away from your heart of being in the house of god because you have the holy ghost you have a you have a god you can put in your pocket take it out like a cell phone the bible says as we see the day approaching yes as we see the day approaching and we see the things that are happening even if you don't have the time but the desire don't lost the desire the crave i want to be there lord you know i want to be amen and if you're craved to the top god will turn the clock around for you but some people are not craving they are looking for every way to be away from the house of god every every they are doing everything to be away and the thing about it there is that they don't even have no stable diet ask them about their own personal devotion that's what took israel into captivity because they despise the sabbath of the lord that's what make jacob to lose his birthright because he despised the breath right and despising it's just so easy it's just winking your shoulder it's just winging your shoulder let them say whatever they want to say praise the lord that's how much the breath right is important praise the lord you know when brother branham talks about praying choosing your pastor choosing your church why because there's a priesthood that's an office where god has put the right that this church will benefit if this church will ever come to be a fruitful church it will have a man that is dedicated to the word when the prophet of god said you can't live higher than your pastor it does not mean your own personal walk with god it means as a body walk that's right because he's the man that stands as an angel that god deal with for the church that's the same way he did through the church ages praise the lord he have promised us and his promise is yea in amen his promise is truth praise the lord his promise is truth even in the day words uh darkness is all over the place and doubts is all over the place god is just looking for the man or a woman that would dedicate your life to the world and he will be the same yesterday today and forever so our breath right is in christ and he is in the word christ is the word christ in our day is the revered word of the hour in him we move and we have our being musicians you can come in him we move and we have our being we have an ancient day where people you take search church for association no sense of dedication people struggling with things in their life that comes through church door and go out praise the lord if jesus christ is the same he can heals he can deliver [Music] like i always say you will serve him the way you know him but he molding how you know him [Music] this message of the hour is the move of god it's not just an association it's the move of god to be able to move the people into the reality of god move the people into a translation move the people into a rapture [Music] if it concern you you will do something about it [Music] you see that in the scripture how men were born in the lineage of the first born but yet it was swapped why even though divinely we can see that god led them that way but you also realize there was something in the heart of moses when he looked through the window and look at those hebrews he saw them different like the egyptians were looking at them there was something in his heart people it's a hot thing it's a hard birth god is dealing with the heart and let that young man or let that young woman start to take interest in the things of god [Music] let that young person start to take position with the word because the word is the first bond so if you take position with the word god brings you in that place and he bless you in a way [Music] praise the lord it's the law of god it's the lord of god [Music] the only thing our young people want to do everybody want to preach ask little sam your brother brother uh max son he will tell you his story about david and goliath he get a wonderful inspiration about david and goliath but just just learning to be a son learning to have interests clean the church clean around the building do things [Music] it's not just showing up in suit play music singing special but you're taking interest in the father things you're taking interest you're getting yourself involved it's a work inside you get behind the curtain you take god's word you devote yourself to it you get a discipline a prayer life a time with god it's the attitude that the father looks at he said this son has more interest than this one i'm going to bless him [Music] i could say some things to you it might sound so personal i'm not too fond of it so i'm going to leave it like that because it's all about christ it's not about an individual every day i see helping me lord to overcome all my triers he's guiding me constantly and he gave me victory oh this is our reality [Music] something keeps holding me oh something keeps holding me every day i see helping me faithfully to overcome my he's guiding me constantly giving me

start taking interest in the in the first born which is the word you start taking interest that's where you get the breath right then he brings you into position god care less about your natural birthright your natural position in your family he care less about it it's all about a spiritual position that's what jesus was trying to show the pharisees about the story about the practical son he was trying to show that god is all about a spiritual move it's not about a natural move he says you are the first born you kept the law you kept the ordinance but you don't know what really grace is a covenant of grace is going to birth the people which is the younger son that has gone out and and you have done all sorts of things but the bible say he he sat down and he taught he talked on his father why should i be eating in the pig pen when i have a father that has everything he taught on the ability of the father he took interest he said if i can just go back home and be a son if i can save my father a desire to save wanting to do something not just to come and sit down and warm the bench let's just buy our house to the lord [Music] guiding me come standing giving me victory this is a reality something keeps hold clean let's just pray together heavenly father lord jesus oh god we want to thank you lord one what up what a place that you have brought us lord you god that make us
