[0:00] [Music]
[0:10] The
[0:12] sand.
[0:17] [Music]
[0:26] This is an old hymn. It's really a
[0:28] blessing.
[0:29] you enjoy this the words as much as I
[0:32] will enjoy singing.
[0:35] I sung this many decades ago. I just
[0:39] thought of it yesterday.
[0:44] [Music]
[0:58] The sanded
[1:02] in the foot
[1:06] [Music]
[1:08] of the stranger
[1:11] of Galore.
[1:12] [Music]
[1:17] And the voice that subdued the rough
[1:22] pillows
[1:26] will be heard in Judea
[1:30] no more.
[1:34] But the path of that lone
[1:41] with joy I will follow today.
[1:49] For the tolls of the road will seem
[1:54] nothing
[1:57] when I get to the end of the way.
[2:04] For the tolls of the road will seem
[2:09] nothing
[2:12] when I get to the end of the way.
[2:23] There are so many hills to climb upward.
[2:30] I often am longing for rest.
[2:38] But he who appoints me my pathway
[2:44] knows just what is needful and best.
[2:51] I know in his word he has promised
[2:58] his strength shall be be as my day.
[3:05] For the tall of the road will seem
[3:09] nothing
[3:11] when I get to the end of the way.
[3:18] For the tall of the road will seem
[3:22] nothing
[3:25] when I get to the end of the way.
[3:31] [Music]
[3:35] He loves me too well to forsake me
[3:42] or give me one trial too much.
[3:49] All his children have been dearly
[3:53] purchased.
[3:54] [Music]
[3:55] And Satan can never claim such.
[4:02] By and by I shall see him and praise
[4:07] him in the city of unending
[4:12] day.
[4:14] And the tall of the road will seem
[4:18] nothing
[4:21] when I get to the end of the way.
[4:27] And the top of the road will seem
[4:32] nothing
[4:34] when I get to the end of the way.
[4:44] When the last faithful step has been
[4:48] taken
[4:49] [Music]
[4:51] and the gates of that city appear.
[4:57] And the beautiful song of the angels
[5:03] float out on my listening ear.
[5:10] When all not all that now seems so
[5:13] mysterious
[5:16] will be bright and as clear as the day.
[5:22] The trolls of the road will be nothing.
[5:29] When I get to the end of the way,
[5:34] [Music]
[5:36] the to of the road will be nothing
[5:42] when I get to the end of the way.
[5:52] Thank you, Jesus.

[28:34] with twins they did fly.
[28:38] And one cried unto another, that is the
[28:41] saraphim now crying on one onto another
[28:45] and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
[28:48] of hosts. The whole earth is full of his
[28:51] glory." and the post of the door move at
[28:55] the voice of him that cried and the
[28:58] house was filled with smoke.
[29:01] Then sorry
[29:07] dr something cold that I was not
[29:08] supposed to do but it's okay then say I
[29:12] wo is me for I'm undone because I am a
[29:18] man of unclean lips and I dwed in the
[29:22] midst of a people of unclean lips. My
[29:26] eyes have seen the king the Lord of
[29:28] hosts. Then flew one of the saraphene
[29:32] unto men, having a life coat in his
[29:34] hands, which he have taken with the
[29:38] thong from of the altar, and he lay it
[29:42] upon my mouth,
[29:45] and and said, Lo, this have touched thy
[29:49] lips, and thine iniquity is taken away,
[29:53] and thy sin is ped.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Also I heard a voice of the Lord
[30:00] saying whom whom shall I send
[30:03] &gt;&gt; and who will go for us? Then I said here
[30:07] am I sent me.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Here am I sent me. The Lord bless you.
[30:13] You may have your seat while you turn to
[30:15] Ephesians chapter 6.
[30:20] Why you turn to Ephesians chapter 6
[30:22] tonight. Praise the Lord. I hope you all
[30:25] had a wonderful wonderful week going on
[30:28] for you. Amen.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; I hope you all had have a wonderful week
[30:34] going on uh uh for you. So, Ephesians
[30:37] chapter 6 in my reading there. I said
[30:39] from verse one, but I won't read from
[30:41] verse one. I will read from verse 10.
[30:44] If you said verse 10, I said from verse
[30:46] 1 to 10, but it's from verse 10.
[30:49] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[30:51] Lord and in the power of his might. put
[30:54] on the whole armor of God, that ye may
[30:56] be able to stand against the ws of the
[30:59] devil. For we rise not against flesh and
[31:02] blood, but against principality, against
[31:05] power, against rulers of the darkness of
[31:09] this world, against spiritual wickedness
[31:12] in high places.
[31:14] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[31:18] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[31:22] in the evil days and having done all to
[31:25] stand. Praise the Lord.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Paul is now coming to dress. Stand
[31:29] therefore having your your Leon's guilt
[31:32] about with truth and having on the
[31:34] breastplate of righteousness. And then
[31:37] he goes on and then he goes on and and
[31:40] and and we you will see here when you
[31:43] when you count the the the the
[31:48] dress code of this uh Christian soldier
[31:52] uh uh uh Paul actually gave us seven of
[31:57] them. Seven of them. Praise the Lord.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; So he gave us seven of them. Let's look
[32:04] at it together. And verse 14, uh uh you
[32:08] standing there for and your layers gide
[32:11] with truth. That's one. Your breastplate
[32:13] of righteousness, that's two. Your your
[32:16] your feet shs with the preparation of
[32:18] the gospel. That's three. Above all,
[32:21] take the shield of faith. That's four.
[32:25] Wherewith ye shall be able to quench the
[32:28] fairy dat of the wicked. Take the take
[32:31] the hermit of salvation. That's five.
[32:35] And the sword of the spirit which is the
[32:38] word of God. There are six.
[32:41] Praise the Lord.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:44] The seventh is praying always.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Praying always. Now, so tonight I want
[32:54] to I want to take a a little talk
[32:57] tonight that I call wash that seven. uh
[33:01] is is actually a quote. I just took that
[33:04] phrase from a quote that brother Brandon
[33:06] shared in uh souls that are in prison.
[33:10] He says this in in the message souls
[33:12] that are in prison. He says uh uh the
[33:16] seven is always a mystery.
[33:19] Wash that seven.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; He said the seven is always a mystery.
[33:26] Wash that seven. So when you see right
[33:29] here all the armor that Paul gave us,
[33:32] six of them are physical. The seven is a
[33:36] mystery.
[33:37] Praise the Lord. Because you don't put
[33:39] on prayer.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't put on prayer.
[33:47] You put on the hair. You put on the the
[33:49] the shade of faith. You put on the
[33:51] breastplate and all of that, but you
[33:53] pray always without ceasing.
[33:56] Praise the Lord. Amen. So like like like
[34:00] he says here, he says the seven is
[34:02] always a mystery. Watch there seven.
[34:05] That's the finish.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; That was the coming of the Lord.
[34:12] Heaven was quiet, silent. Nobody moved.
[34:15] He's talking about the seven the seven
[34:21] seal. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; So, I'm taking that little thought
[34:25] tonight. Watch that seven. That's what I
[34:27] want to go. But I'm that I'm I'm going
[34:30] to use that to be able to jump to
[34:32] something tonight. and uh and just trust
[34:35] that the Lord because what what actually
[34:37] I want to do tonight is that u like I
[34:40] said before, you remember when we talk
[34:43] about uh Moses telling the children of
[34:46] Israel that uh if uh if a man steal a
[34:51] sheep, he must restore it four times.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; And and and what we learn from there is
[34:58] that God deals with principles.
[35:02] Praise the Lord.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God deals with principles. You
[35:07] see, the reason why the law was given,
[35:10] it was not for us to keep it because
[35:12] nobody can keep the Lord. But God gave
[35:15] the Lord to be able to show our need for
[35:19] a savior.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; When you realize that you can't keep the
[35:24] Lord, then you found out that you have a
[35:27] need of a savior.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So you see there are a
[35:32] lot of principles the entire world that
[35:35] God created he created it with
[35:37] principles and until we until we
[35:42] understand the principles of God you
[35:44] will just be you will just be following
[35:46] the strength
[35:49] trying to keep this and trying to keep
[35:51] this and trying to do this and trying to
[35:53] evolve this because there are a lot of
[35:55] things I mean God could he could have
[35:58] created the entire world in one day. Why
[36:01] he used six days and the seven he rested
[36:05] &gt;&gt; is a principle.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; He put the principle of our redemption
[36:10] in creation.
[36:14] So when you understand
[36:16] God's principle,
[36:20] then you can be able to unlock
[36:24] the secret, you can be able to unlock
[36:26] the blessings of God. you can be able to
[36:28] unlock because lot of things that people
[36:32] look at from the Bible all they see is
[36:34] just rules don't do this don't do and
[36:37] done that's all they see but they don't
[36:39] see God's principle now so
[36:43] and that is the reason why
[36:46] uh uh uh uh God promised for the
[36:49] mysteries to be revealed in this day to
[36:52] be able to show us his principles. So,
[36:55] we're going to look at some tonight.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. It's always a mystery,
[37:02] brother. Amen.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. At the at the the the wedding of
[37:13] Ka, Jesus took six pot,
[37:18] you know, and told him to fill it. He
[37:20] told the woman uh the uh the word you
[37:23] have five husband the one you are with
[37:25] is now your husband that was the six.
[37:28] Where was the seven?
[37:30] &gt;&gt; The seven was a mystery. He was the
[37:31] seven.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; He was the seven.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; You look at the city of refuge. You go
[37:38] back there. You read it in in in uh uh
[37:41] in Exodus. Uh uh there you will find
[37:44] that there were six city of refuge. And
[37:46] yet Jesus will come and say, "Come unto
[37:48] me all you that labor and I will give
[37:50] you rest."
[37:51] &gt;&gt; So the seven is always a mystery.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, Brother Brandham
[37:57] in the message uh uh in the on the wings
[38:00] of a snow white dove, he talks about
[38:02] that vision concerning the problem he
[38:05] had in his stomach.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; You know, uh that stomach he had uh uh
[38:10] you know, in the vision, he swallowed
[38:12] that animal that was battering his
[38:13] stomach. It bothered him all of his
[38:15] life. But the Lord told him it was just
[38:18] six inches long.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Why? Six is six is the number of men.
[38:26] Six is a human number. Six is the number
[38:30] of time.
[38:32] Praise the Lord. And the seven will
[38:35] bring him his healing.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; So watch that seven. It's always a
[38:40] mystery.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. That's the reason
[38:44] why after every seven years we we
[38:47] experience a major change in our life
[38:49] that we don't even understand because
[38:51] it's a mystery. We we are breaking into
[38:53] a new age and new things happening all
[38:55] in our mind, our body, everything.
[38:58] That's not where I want to go tonight.
[39:00] But I just have to stir myself up. Amen.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; I just I just have to stir myself up
[39:06] tonight. So I will be going in in and
[39:08] out of uh wash the seven is always a
[39:12] mystery. Now this is the thing that
[39:15] caught my mind on this. That's the
[39:16] reason why I I'm saying this to you
[39:19] because as you read the word of God, as
[39:22] you read the message of the hour, uh uh
[39:25] I mean you can't know God by letters.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; God is known. The prophet of God said
[39:32] he's identified by what? his
[39:35] characteristics.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; And one of God's characteristics is that
[39:43] he's the God of principle.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; You got to watch his principle.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; The moment you see it, it will never
[39:49] lie.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; It will never lie.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; He's the God of principle. Now, so on on
[39:58] on Sunday, uh uh time is not my friend
[40:01] yet. I have to run.
[40:04] Something I I really wanted to speak on
[40:06] tonight uh uh in bringing this to you,
[40:09] but I have to go through this for us to
[40:11] get there. And and what it is is that I
[40:14] was down in in uh uh uh Johannesburg
[40:18] this long long time that I that I I went
[40:20] away and I spoke on the subject and I I
[40:23] I I treated something and the Lord
[40:27] really blessed it in a way that I have
[40:29] not dealt with that subject before.
[40:31] And I and I thought after the service, I
[40:34] thought about it and I said, "Well,
[40:36] maybe when I get home, I will review
[40:38] it." I've spoken about it year before,
[40:40] but in the way that the Lord bless it,
[40:43] uh uh it was it was different. So, I
[40:46] want to see if I can be able to go in
[40:48] that direction. If we don't do it today,
[40:50] tonight, we will finish it on Sunday.
[40:52] So, but on Sunday when we when we spoke,
[40:56] we dealt with the the wars of Isaiah
[41:00] chapter 5.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; The wars of Isaiah chapter 5, which of
[41:06] course we we said that uh Isaiah were
[41:10] describing the the the the civilization
[41:15] that was supposed to come. Praise the
[41:18] Lord.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Woe unto them that build house upon
[41:21] house. war unto them that call good
[41:23] evil. War unto them that raise up early
[41:26] in the morning and go after strong
[41:28] drinks. I mean, he he just he's
[41:30] prophesying. He's dealing with the
[41:32] culture. He's dealing with the the the
[41:35] present destructive h civilization.
[41:39] But now, watch here. Now, if you go back
[41:43] to Isaiah chapter 5, uh we don't have
[41:46] all the time to run after it, but if you
[41:48] pay attention on Sunday and you count
[41:51] those walls, they were six.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; If you count the walls, they were six.
[42:01] Wo unto them that join house to house.
[42:03] One, war unto them that rise up early in
[42:05] the morning and go after strong drink.
[42:07] Two, woe unto them that drink iniquity.
[42:10] Three, woe unto them that call evil
[42:13] good. Four, woe unto them that are wise
[42:17] in their own eyes. Five, woe unto them
[42:21] that
[42:22] are mighty to drink wine. Six, where is
[42:25] the seven? It's always a mystery.
[42:28] The seven will come in the next chapter.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Whoa, it's me."
[42:34] &gt;&gt; That was the thing that just
[42:37] It just it it it just blew my mind.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; It just it just threw me. I mean, it it
[42:43] threw me against the wall.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; I I said, "Oh my god."
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; A principle of redemption is right
[42:52] before my eyes.
[42:55] So I then went back and and and and I'
[42:58] I've listened to brother brand message I
[43:00] think just few days a couple of uh last
[43:02] week on his presence because he preached
[43:05] that message in September. So I I had to
[43:08] go back again. There was some things I
[43:10] so I had to go back and listen to it
[43:12] again just to be able to pick up some
[43:15] few things. But that's where I want us
[43:17] to go tonight. That's what that's what I
[43:19] want to grab your attention tonight.
[43:22] We're not just coming to church just to
[43:24] be in church people. We are not just
[43:26] coming to church just to play religion.
[43:29] God is releasing his his his presence,
[43:33] his being to us.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; He's he's releasing himself to us. And
[43:38] if there is ever a time that we need
[43:42] &gt;&gt; h
[43:43] God as a person is right now.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. right now with all the
[43:50] craziness that is that is that is going
[43:52] on in the world and especially in this
[43:54] nation with with all the the the the the
[43:58] religious things that is going on. I
[44:00] mean we we have to prepare ourself.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; We have to get a hold of God.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; We have a promise one of these days this
[44:07] church these churches those will be
[44:09] shut.
[44:11] I was just thinking about that when when
[44:13] uh when uh when I started showing to you
[44:15] in a scripture that churches begins from
[44:17] home. That was one of the thing that was
[44:19] in my mind. I wanted to go down that
[44:21] route. It begin uh uh in homes. It will
[44:25] end in homes because when the church's
[44:27] doors are shut, we will have to meet at
[44:29] homes.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:41] Because now unless you are preaching the
[44:44] revealed word, unless you are preaching
[44:46] Jesus Christ, you are so tempted to say
[44:50] something and you might be misunderstood
[44:52] by people on the on on on the internet
[44:54] and then pretty soon before you know
[44:56] they start running to your church to to
[44:57] put you in in in in handcuffs because I
[45:00] mean the whole society now is just so
[45:03] polarized.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:06] with everything that is happening.
[45:08] Praise the Lord.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; You could say something and not even
[45:14] trying to go in the way of politics or
[45:16] what is happening and and and and
[45:19] somebody will just misunderstand you and
[45:21] and then blow blow you on on on YouTube
[45:25] and make you saying that thing over and
[45:26] over and over and everybody that hear it
[45:29] don't even know you, they will start to
[45:31] hate you and and where is that place?
[45:33] Let's go down to that church and and all
[45:35] of that there.
[45:37] But that's not what I'm talking tonight.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to show you tonight is
[45:41] that watch that seven
[45:44] &gt;&gt; is always a mystery. Even in your life.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Even in your life.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; The things that God will do, the things
[45:54] he will allow,
[45:56] &gt;&gt; wash that ser
[45:59] &gt;&gt; because if you can wash it and grab it,
[46:02] you get the blessing.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; You can be in the midst of it. If you
[46:07] don't see it, it does not mean anything
[46:09] to you.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Watch that. Seven is always a blessing.
[46:14] Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. So that's the thing that
[46:17] caught my mind here. Sis Walls as I
[46:20] spoke about uh uh uh talking about the
[46:24] the the you know the the the society the
[46:27] cosmos uh and and and you know the word
[46:30] because we what we were talking about is
[46:32] turn they turn the word upside down. So
[46:34] we were looking at cosmo. We were trying
[46:36] to see how that the world was already
[46:39] upside down. These guys were just trying
[46:41] to bring it back to where it's supposed
[46:43] to be the way that God wanted it to be.
[46:45] Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; So, so we were looking at that.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh but just just just
[46:55] thinking on that, just meditating on
[46:58] that. Then uh it got to the place where
[47:00] my mind I was just I was just reading
[47:03] this and and I says, "Oh my god, I've
[47:05] not seen this." I read this. I preach
[47:08] preach uh message after message from
[47:10] here. I've not seen this until
[47:14] a couple of days when the Lord just u
[47:16] now so that's what I want to go tonight
[47:18] you know that's what I want to go
[47:20] tonight that's exactly where I want to
[47:23] go tonight this is a prayer meeting I
[47:26] will take the message uh uh the great
[47:28] commission I'll take the message the
[47:30] great commission let's let's go quickly
[47:33] if I have found grace in your sight
[47:35] listen now if I have found grace in your
[47:38] sight through God
[47:40] you take My word for this brethren,
[47:44] if you want to be a blessing and get a
[47:48] blessing, when a man has done you wrong
[47:52] and he's absolutely justly, I mean, he
[47:55] has done you wrong and you know, praise
[47:59] the Lord.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:03] And uh I was just thinking I was just
[48:06] thinking uh uh you know I was just
[48:10] thinking
[48:12] about what I just said
[48:15] uh and and what what was running to my
[48:17] mind is that it is always in a time of
[48:20] crisis
[48:22] you know when people start feeling you
[48:25] know the need of crisis that's when they
[48:28] start running to God.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I mean uh the churches will
[48:33] soon start getting fooled again because
[48:36] people will uh uh you know somebody says
[48:39] uh when
[48:42] is is is is having trouble that's when
[48:44] man runs to the moon. The moon is a type
[48:48] of the church.
[48:50] So let's let's go ahead here. The
[48:53] prophet of God says if I have found
[48:55] grace in your sight through God you take
[48:58] my word for this. If a man if a person
[49:02] if you if you want a blessing and get a
[49:04] blessing when when a person has done you
[49:07] wrong and he's absolutely wrong. I mean
[49:09] he has done you wrong and you know that
[49:13] he's done you wrong. He's done you evil.
[49:17] Don't mention that. You take him to
[49:19] prayer before God.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; He said take my word for this. If I if I
[49:28] mean anything to you,
[49:31] praise the Lord. I mean this this is
[49:33] just a a humble simple way to say if you
[49:36] consider me
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; to be anything to you,
[49:39] &gt;&gt; take my word for this.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; There there is there's something he say
[49:47] here. That's what I want to come to. He
[49:49] says if a man has done you wrong, don't
[49:52] mention that you take him to prayer
[49:55] before God. That is one of the difficult
[49:59] things to do.
[50:01] That is one of the difficult things to
[50:03] do.
[50:05] It's It's not him to do it,
[50:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:08] &gt;&gt; No, it's not him. God has to get a hold
[50:11] of you.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; For you to do this.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; It's not him to do it.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; I also show you where it is now. Himmon,
[50:19] Praise the Lord.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says uh and don't take it in
[50:26] a way of just a selfish and say well I'm
[50:30] supposed to do this but stand with your
[50:35] shoulder to his shoulder and stand in
[50:38] the presence of God our father
[50:44] where the prayer should be made in his
[50:46] presence and say father yes my brother
[50:49] or yes my sister he's justly. He
[50:51] deserved punishment because he has done
[50:54] me evil and I don't see why he did it.
[50:58] Then let God go to talking to you. Allow
[51:03] God to talk to you. Now that's that's
[51:06] why I say is this thing is not human
[51:08] because the problem there is that many
[51:11] times when we say we feel sorry for
[51:13] people
[51:15] it is not
[51:17] it is not in a place of us having
[51:20] compassion. It is in a place of us
[51:23] having sympathy.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Now we've been taught compassion is the
[51:27] will of God.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; So if you approach it this way you will
[51:31] be having compassion on that person.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Right? Praise the Lord. Because most of
[51:36] the time when we when we when we say
[51:39] that we we feel sorry for a person, the
[51:43] way our mind channel been feeling sorry
[51:46] for a person is that is uh uh you know I
[51:50] I just wish that God would whip that
[51:52] person back.
[51:54] I just wish that God would really give
[51:56] it back to him 10 times that he did.
[52:00] That's the way we feel sorry for the
[52:01] person.
[52:04] Praise the Lord.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together now? So he says here and
[52:12] uh standing should stand in the present
[52:14] God our father. The way the prayer
[52:16] should be made say father yes my brother
[52:18] he's just he deserve to be punished.
[52:20] He's done me wrong. I don't see why he
[52:23] did it. Then let go talking to you and
[52:26] you will see maybe we have read this
[52:29] before. We'll see. you will see maybe
[52:31] what that man has been through.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Now that's when you are coming to the
[52:40] place of having compassion for him
[52:44] because now you are beginning to step in
[52:47] his shoes. Now you are beginning to
[52:50] think, "Oh my God, how the devil is
[52:54] trying to destroy this man, brother."
[52:56] You are no longer thinking about what he
[52:59] did to you, but you are thinking of how
[53:02] God is how the devil is about to destroy
[53:05] this man life and Satan purpose for this
[53:08] person is to send them to hell. You
[53:10] start getting so mad with the devil.
[53:12] You're not even thinking about what the
[53:14] person has done because now you are
[53:17] getting so mad that the devil has blind
[53:20] this guy. He can see that Satan is is is
[53:23] using him.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:33] Then let God go talking to you and you
[53:35] will see maybe what that man has been
[53:38] through. The devil has twist him up
[53:41] somewhere and caused him to do that
[53:46] though he's absolutely wrong.
[53:49] Before you leave the throne of God, you
[53:53] will feel sorry for that man. Amen.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; You will be sympathizing
[53:58] for that brother.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; You'll be stepping in his shoes.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "And and and and when you
[54:10] get back down
[54:13] to work ever again, when you come out of
[54:16] prayer, when you come from out of
[54:18] prayer, which mean you have already
[54:22] broke the barrier of of of of getting
[54:25] over your frustration, you have broke
[54:27] the barriers of getting over all the
[54:29] thoughts that is going through your
[54:30] mind. You have broke the barrier of
[54:32] getting all over your emotions that you
[54:35] don't even know where you are. You're so
[54:37] lost in the spirit. You are so mad with
[54:40] the devil and I mean you are just reing
[54:42] it down on Satan. You are a beast. You
[54:45] are a serpent. You are cursed from the
[54:47] beginning. I rebuke you. I mean you you
[54:49] are so much on the devil when you get
[54:51] back down to earth.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; you will go over to that brother and
[54:59] shake his hands cuz you know what he has
[55:02] been through.
[55:04] you understand that it is just the devil
[55:07] that has messed this guy mind up. The
[55:11] devil has just messed this person up
[55:14] and that they are they they are just
[55:17] they are just filled with uh with with
[55:21] person stuff from the devil in their
[55:23] mind in their spirit. I mean when you
[55:25] open their mouth you can just smell the
[55:27] breath of Satan.
[55:35] cuz you know what he has been through.
[55:38] You can't stand with a mortar in the
[55:40] presence of God and condemn anybody.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; I don't believe no sir. Even if
[55:47] he is a rank sinner,
[55:51] &gt;&gt; you ever get into God's presence,
[55:55] &gt;&gt; we're coming into his presence now.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was where Isaiah got in
[56:01] chapter five. He could see the evil that
[56:05] was in the word. You know, word unto
[56:08] them that is doing rise up early. Woe
[56:10] unto them that is wise in their eyes.
[56:12] Woe unto them that are drunk. Wo unto
[56:14] them that are that are immoral. Woe unto
[56:17] them that are abominable. He could see
[56:19] all of that. But when he came into the
[56:22] presence of God,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; when he came into the presence of God,
[56:29] &gt;&gt; and he stepped beyond his mind, beyond
[56:33] his emotion,
[56:35] &gt;&gt; he couldn't see the destruction of the
[56:37] city or the pollution of the city, he
[56:40] could only see himself. Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; He could only see himself and his need
[56:49] for God.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; When he's out there, he was seen uh the
[56:53] world is evil. He's righteous. But when
[56:55] he gets in the presence of God,
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; He see his need
[57:00] &gt;&gt; for God.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:11] Even if he's a ranked sinner,
[57:14] you can't stand with any mortar in the
[57:16] presence of God and condemn them.
[57:26] How it's so easy for us to to uh forget
[57:29] these things. You know, we can we can
[57:34] forget forget about it. When we when we
[57:36] say we forget about something, we we
[57:38] pack it nicely
[57:41] and forget about it.
[57:45] You pack it and keep it to the place
[57:47] where nobody will touch it. When you're
[57:49] ready, you go pick it up again.
[57:58] Praise the Lord. Watch that seven.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; When when Isaiah broke into that
[58:06] principle, it changed his life forever.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; When he broke into that principle,
[58:14] it changed his life forever. His life
[58:18] was not the same. Read Isaiah 1:5.
[58:22] And after chapter 6, read the rest of
[58:25] Isaiah. It's completely different. his
[58:29] ministry changed the things that he
[58:32] begin to see
[58:34] right in chapter 7 he saw 700 years
[58:39] telling Ahaz I gave you a sign ask God
[58:42] for the sign he said no I can't ask God
[58:44] he said is there anything too hard for
[58:45] the Lord asking for the sign behold a
[58:47] virgin shall conceive let me tell you
[58:49] now let me give you a sign if God will
[58:51] make a virgin to conceive
[58:56] &gt;&gt; it changes life it change his ministry.
[58:59] He was no longer looking at the
[59:01] filthiness around him. He was break into
[59:04] a vision, looking at the promise,
[59:07] looking at the millennium, Isaiah 53. He
[59:10] was looking at Calvary. I mean, he was
[59:12] he has he has gone.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he broke into a he broke
[59:18] into a principle of God.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:25] Our
[59:40] sight is is uh all we can see is as far
[59:44] as our nose.
[59:47] That's why we quick to condemn. That's
[59:49] why we quick to criticize because it's
[59:51] just right our nose.
[59:53] Praise the Lord.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:02] I wanted to say something, but I should
[1:00:04] just keep it.
[1:00:06] Go ahead with this.
[1:00:09] No. So, that's that's what is bringing
[1:00:10] us to the subject. Now, I'm not going
[1:00:12] into the mysteries or nothing like that,
[1:00:14] but I just took this because it's a
[1:00:16] principle that never fail.
[1:00:20] It never fail.
[1:00:22] You can take it all through the
[1:00:24] scripture. It never fail.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; When Ruth took the courage and broke
[1:00:41] into the field of
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Bo.
[1:00:45] when she took the courage and Moab Gil
[1:00:50] took the courage to break into the field
[1:00:52] that field the field of the harvest
[1:00:55] was was gathering with men that have
[1:00:58] drunk and they were drunk.
[1:01:01] They have drank all night.
[1:01:04] They are rejoicing over the harvest.
[1:01:11] It was a place for only boys. girls were
[1:01:13] not invited.
[1:01:15] But she took the courage.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Because she wanted something from the
[1:01:20] Lord.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; She brave herself to sneak that nobody
[1:01:27] will see her.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; How will she be able to identify Boas
[1:01:38] among all these drunky men?
[1:01:44] She had to be tipping over her toe,
[1:01:46] dashing down and and and you know,
[1:01:48] holding her breath so nobody can hear
[1:01:50] her breathing even when the guys came
[1:01:52] closer.
[1:01:55] But then when she got there and she was
[1:01:58] able to find Boas,
[1:02:02] she cover herself with his skirt. I'm
[1:02:05] going to get to that.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; She used his skirt at the end of uh of
[1:02:13] and and she just cover herself.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; When Boaz realized,
[1:02:19] Amen.
[1:02:21] he got a a feeling a stranger is in my
[1:02:24] tent.
[1:02:27] The Bible says he commanded his men to
[1:02:30] give her six val.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; He gave her six. One, two, three, six.
[1:02:40] It's because the seven was a mystery.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; The seven was himself.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. It never failed.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; The seven was himself.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; He knew that it was time to redeem this
[1:02:59] woman.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; She needed redemption. Yes.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; watch the seven. It never fail.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; So, yes. Yes. Isaiah here. Isaiah, he's
[1:03:17] he's breaking into this place here where
[1:03:19] the uh uh uh uh you know uh can use the
[1:03:24] ad. He go got it into the temple. And I
[1:03:26] mean this guy pouring out his heart
[1:03:28] before God. He don't even know where to
[1:03:30] begin from.
[1:03:33] But he got a principle from God.
[1:03:37] Not even having the revelation of this
[1:03:39] thing. And then he never even knew the
[1:03:42] seven. He didn't even know that. Praise
[1:03:45] the Lord.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; But he stepped right into it.
[1:03:50] He stepped right into it.
[1:03:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:56] And sometimes that is the way with our
[1:03:58] life.
[1:04:00] You can walk right into the into the
[1:04:03] seven seals and don't even know it.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; But because you have stepped into it,
[1:04:07] God is going to bless you.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; You are stepped into a place with God.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says right there that uh
[1:04:24] uh uh where is this guy name? Kenas.
[1:04:28] Coena was just doing what he was doing
[1:04:33] but he did it one more time and God says
[1:04:36] your arm has reached up to me.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; He was just doing what he was doing.
[1:04:46] He was not publicizing it on Facebook or
[1:04:49] going on on on YouTube or Instagram,
[1:04:52] nothing. He was just doing the Bible
[1:04:54] says he was a man that gave arms.
[1:04:57] But there was one more time he did it.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; An angel came down.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; And say, "Your arms has reached out."
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; One more time he did it.
[1:05:09] Amen.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; He broke into a seven seal.
[1:05:15] Whenever you get into the presence of
[1:05:18] angels,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; glory,
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; you are in the seven seats.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery.
[1:05:33] It's always a mystery.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Now, so we see here, you know, he he
[1:05:39] gets to that place and and and he says,
[1:05:42] "Lord, woe is me.
[1:05:44] I'm a man or dumb. You just watch that.
[1:05:48] He did not He did not talk about the
[1:05:50] president. He didn't talk about the king
[1:05:52] and say, "Oh, Uzia." He didn't talk
[1:05:55] nothing.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; It was him.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; It was him
[1:06:06] that Lord, this is my time.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; I'm the one in need of prayer. I'm the
[1:06:12] one that need to be changed. I'm the one
[1:06:14] that needs help.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that needs deliverance.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that God, one of the
[1:06:22] angels took a coat of fire
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; from off the altar.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Come and touch his lip.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Say your lip is clean and your iniquity
[1:06:33] are forgiven.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; It changed his life. It was almost like
[1:06:37] Jesus saying to that woman, go and sin
[1:06:40] no more. It was not a commandment. No.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; It was an instruction. It's two
[1:06:46] different things.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he has taken the sin desire
[1:06:53] out of her and said, "God, even if you
[1:06:55] try, you will never sin again."
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; It was not an instruction
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; or a commandment. He was instructing
[1:07:02] her.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Something has happened to you.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; When I wrote it on the ground, I wrote
[1:07:08] everything that was in you on the
[1:07:09] ground. I raised it.
[1:07:13] God, even if you try, you will never.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Since I gave you water, you never come
[1:07:18] back to this place again.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; She thought it was just a casual
[1:07:22] conversation, but that word was a word
[1:07:25] of eternal life. It was a word that
[1:07:27] could go through her body and change her
[1:07:29] desire.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; The very people she was ashamed to run
[1:07:34] and walk before she went all in the
[1:07:36] city. Come and see the man that told me
[1:07:38] the things that I've done.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was power in the word
[1:07:43] to change her life that very moment.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; She didn't need to go through all your
[1:07:48] seven step and 12 steps.
[1:08:00] Now see what brother Brandon was saying
[1:08:02] here. I'll leave the rest with you.
[1:08:04] Amen. See what he was saying. He says uh
[1:08:07] in Revelation chapter 4 uh uh uh uh uh
[1:08:11] uh throne of mercy message. He says,
[1:08:14] "Now listen, in a year that Yuzia, King
[1:08:17] Yuzia died, I I saw also the Lord
[1:08:20] sitting upon the throne high and lifted
[1:08:22] up and his train filled the temple
[1:08:25] glory." What? His train.
[1:08:29] There it is. What is his stream?
[1:08:33] He says angels
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; being
[1:08:38] his tree that follow him.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; So there were two sets of angels.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; That's what I wanted you to pay
[1:08:47] attention to.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Because the trains were not the
[1:08:51] saraphins.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; the train was the cherubim.
[1:09:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; It was not the saraphins.
[1:09:09] See what he was says here. He says uh uh
[1:09:12] uh uh his train. There it is. Angels
[1:09:16] being his train that follow him. The the
[1:09:20] train
[1:09:21] the train's what come behind.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. The train is what come behind. Are
[1:09:28] we together?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Train is what come behind. His train
[1:09:34] filled the temple. Now watch the what he
[1:09:37] says. And above it stole the seraphim
[1:09:43] and each of them had six wings. Praise
[1:09:47] the Lord. Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; So this was the complete throne of God
[1:09:53] because the servants are the one that
[1:09:55] are responsible for prayers and praises.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; But the train is the god to the throne.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; We you we will go on a little bit here
[1:10:08] and see and see what he says here in the
[1:10:11] message influence of another. He said,
[1:10:12] "Notice, Asa know that he must find
[1:10:16] something different."
[1:10:18] So what he did? What did he do? He went
[1:10:22] to the temple.
[1:10:24] He uh he raised up his hands and he
[1:10:27] cried to God
[1:10:29] and he fell into a vision.
[1:10:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; You people that don't like crying, I
[1:10:37] don't know how how it's going to happen
[1:10:38] to you.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; You know, he cried to God. He fell in
[1:10:41] the vision. And as he fell into the
[1:10:44] vision, he saw God not on a thrown down
[1:10:48] year, but lifted up way up. Oh my. His
[1:10:52] train was following him and and lifted
[1:10:56] up into
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; It's Wednesday night. It's almost 5
[1:11:06] minutes to 9:00. Don't get me to stop
[1:11:08] preaching now. Amen. Don't
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; get me to stop preaching. Hallelujah.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; I'm just feeling so good tonight. Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; His train that follow him and and and
[1:11:18] and lifted up into heavens and he saw
[1:11:22] back and forth through the temple
[1:11:24] saraphine flying. And so what brother
[1:11:27] Brandham is alluding here told is that
[1:11:31] is that Isaiah was caught up into the
[1:11:33] constellation.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's why he's illoney
[1:11:39] yet when he sees this he says yeah uh uh
[1:11:44] uh where am I praise the lord
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; follow him lifted up in and he saw back
[1:11:52] and for through the temple saraphin
[1:11:54] frying oh mine saraphin it means burner
[1:11:57] the word saraphim means burner
[1:12:00] uh uh which is next to the altar
[1:12:03] actually the saraphins is the one who
[1:12:06] received the sacrifice and cleanses the
[1:12:08] wor the the worshippers and then present
[1:12:11] him to God. The saraphene does that. Now
[1:12:14] this saraphene was angelic being and
[1:12:17] they are very next one to God right at
[1:12:21] the altar.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And God and and God want to bring every
[1:12:38] one of us into that place.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; This the the the woman had the word she
[1:12:44] never she never calculated.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; She never calculated because it is it is
[1:12:49] God unwritten principle.
[1:12:55] The same reason why God had to work six
[1:12:58] day and rest seven.
[1:13:01] That very same reason. the same reason
[1:13:03] why he had to do that wrongs all the
[1:13:06] time.
[1:13:09] That's is the same reason why uh uh he
[1:13:12] allowed six men in the in that woman's
[1:13:15] life and then at the seventh he came on
[1:13:17] the scene.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; That's the same reason why he allowed
[1:13:24] Boaz under inspiration gave her six B
[1:13:27] load because the next day Boaz is going
[1:13:30] to redeem her. Amen.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; these are divine principles.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; They are divine principles. We said all
[1:13:41] of these things, we hear them, they
[1:13:43] become so common to us.
[1:13:48] That's what brother B is saying here. If
[1:13:50] you consider me to be anything, take
[1:13:53] this from me.
[1:13:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:05] Now, so we see here uh uh
[1:14:10] we see yet I mean I've I've already uh
[1:14:13] uh gone through my time here and uh uh
[1:14:20] let's let's let's just see if we can we
[1:14:22] can be able to to uh do something here
[1:14:26] before we we go home. And uh really what
[1:14:30] I wanted to bring to you is is that
[1:14:32] principle so you can see it is is for
[1:14:35] you so so you can be aware of it.
[1:14:40] So you can be aware of it. If you listen
[1:14:43] to the message the wings of the snow
[1:14:45] white door brother even experienced that
[1:14:47] God gave him that vision of that animal
[1:14:50] many years back.
[1:14:52] But just at the time where his healing
[1:14:55] would come, God brought the vision back
[1:14:58] to his mind. He said, remember in the
[1:15:00] vision, it was only 6 in long.
[1:15:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; And no matter what we go through in this
[1:15:12] life is just 6 in long.
[1:15:18] Praise the Lord. That's God's
[1:15:19] measurement.
[1:15:23] You might think your trial is just 6 in.
[1:15:26] It it have to be in human time. It never
[1:15:30] goes beyond human time.
[1:15:34] It never goes beyond him time. God's
[1:15:37] that God's length to be able to to to
[1:15:40] measure your sickness, measure your
[1:15:43] sorrow, measure your pain is just 6 in
[1:15:46] long. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; That is the reason why we have a 6,000
[1:15:54] years time spent on earth. The seven is
[1:15:57] a mystery, a millennium.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; The seven is a millennium.
[1:16:09] It's a principle.
[1:16:18] You have to see it.
[1:16:21] You have to believe it.
[1:16:29] You know, because sometimes what what
[1:16:30] happened to us is that we we we get to
[1:16:33] this place where we we we get we get to
[1:16:36] to to to soon, you know, running our
[1:16:38] mind, exercising our mind. So what
[1:16:40] happened is that uh you start to think
[1:16:43] okay it's it's uh it's three years I've
[1:16:46] been going through this now.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; So you counting for for seven years
[1:16:52] that's your time. That's not God's time.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe in God's time you have you are
[1:16:59] just at the end of your six.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:06] The thing about it there is that he
[1:17:09] don't want to work on your calendar. He
[1:17:12] want you to believe
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; that this is his principle.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; And if you believe that God is your
[1:17:19] internal principle.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; So it gave you faith to know that
[1:17:25] when the seventh comes, you will break
[1:17:28] into the mystery.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; You will understand the mystery of your
[1:17:32] trials. you will understand the mystery
[1:17:35] of your pain.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Don't put God on your watch or put him
[1:17:40] on your calendar.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; You are just giving the devil room to
[1:17:47] mess your mind up because now you finish
[1:17:49] counting seven. Nothing happened.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; I told I thought the seven is a mystery.
[1:17:55] My own servant is dark.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; It's because you are on your you are you
[1:18:00] are on your time. You're not on God's
[1:18:02] time.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Maybe to God you just maybe to God you
[1:18:06] have not even started yet.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; So it's a principle.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; It's not a time principle. It's a divine
[1:18:18] principle.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's almost like when
[1:18:24] Moses said, you know, uh uh uh uh uh
[1:18:27] when when you when you when you catch
[1:18:28] the man that that steal uh uh uh a
[1:18:32] sheep, you can't catch him. You can't
[1:18:35] catch him. There is no way you can catch
[1:18:37] you can't catch the devil.
[1:18:40] No, you can't catch him. This guy is
[1:18:43] sneaky.
[1:18:45] Praise the Lord. There is one that can
[1:18:47] catch him.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. There is one that
[1:18:53] can catch you
[1:18:59] because we go through those exercise.
[1:19:01] Oh, you know I I I grabbed the devil.
[1:19:04] You have to restore. The Bible say you
[1:19:05] will restore res.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; It's a divine principle. And what God
[1:19:12] want you to do is to believe it. Amen.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Is to believe it
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; that Lord you gave these principles
[1:19:25] for us for our benefit and as I see it
[1:19:28] in your word is playing out in your
[1:19:31] word.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; How many servants came to Job? The Bible
[1:19:37] says the first one come say your
[1:19:38] children are done. The second one come
[1:19:40] how many? Count it four.
[1:19:44] So right in there,
[1:19:48] a principle of restoration,
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; a seed of restoration was already sown.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Are we are we together?
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; But then how many years did it take take
[1:20:06] God to to to to redeem Job? 14 years.
[1:20:14] But the principle will never fail. It
[1:20:17] will never fail.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; God say I will restore all that the pa
[1:20:24] want the the kanga want the caterpillar
[1:20:27] the locust.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; When it goes through those four stages I
[1:20:32] will restore.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you go through justification,
[1:20:37] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:20:40] Ghost, the Holy Ghost himself, I will
[1:20:42] restore.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; God is not restoring your physical body.
[1:20:49] David said, "Restore my soul."
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; When you go through those experience,
[1:20:58] then God is bringing consciousness to
[1:21:01] your soul. Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; You start to walk with God from the rim
[1:21:06] of your soul, not your mind, not your
[1:21:08] eyes,
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; now your environment,
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; your soul has stepped up in the place.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; But the Bible say in walk with God. It
[1:21:16] was not a physical feat. No, he have got
[1:21:19] into a realm where he started believing
[1:21:21] God.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; He could walk with God into the future.
[1:21:26] That's the reason why he could prophesy
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; and talk about the judgment in the end.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:34] It's late tonight.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come.
[1:21:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; My work is just to just to be able to to
[1:21:51] arm you, give you things for you to use.
[1:21:54] I don't know how to entertain.
[1:21:57] Amen. Because I'm not just a funny guy.
[1:22:03] But I just come up with all of these
[1:22:05] little message by the by, you know, by
[1:22:07] the the the, you know, the the
[1:22:10] inspiration of the Holy Ghost just to,
[1:22:12] you know, uh uh
[1:22:15] uh
[1:22:20] just to be able to encourage you. Praise
[1:22:23] the Lord.
[1:22:25] Love the Lord tonight.
[1:22:29] Are we grateful
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; that God say watch that seven? You know
[1:22:34] the thing about it then is that it is
[1:22:37] God that is watching your seven.
[1:22:40] He's watching when you come into the
[1:22:42] seven when you will come into the
[1:22:44] seventh cycle.
[1:22:49] Pray for me. Just hold this thought. We
[1:22:52] will go we will go there on Sunday
[1:22:55] because where I want to get to here is
[1:22:57] is to is to just show you uh the benefit
[1:23:00] of what what God has given to us in this
[1:23:04] last day.
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:11] Let's bow our heads and pray.
[1:23:15] Heavenly Father, the hour is late. Lord,
[1:23:19] the hour is late.
[1:23:23] More than 50 years.
[1:23:26] More than 50 years going on Lord God to
[1:23:30] 50 plus stay counting
[1:23:34] since your servant the prophet
[1:23:38] left God.
[1:23:41] Your word has been here. We have made
[1:23:43] doctrine out of it. We have made forces
[1:23:46] division. But Lord these were divine
[1:23:49] principles.
[1:23:50] that you give to us for this hour that
[1:23:53] we are living in.
[1:23:58] That's why your prophet would tell us
[1:24:00] over and over, you never ask us to
[1:24:02] understand. You ask us to believe.
[1:24:06] When we see a principle and we see what
[1:24:08] you have done in your word, let's
[1:24:10] believe that that same God,
[1:24:15] that same God
[1:24:20] that could change Sarah body.
[1:24:22] That same God is here tonight.
[1:24:26] That same God
[1:24:29] that could come down in the furnace fire
[1:24:34] that the burning flame
[1:24:36] will not even burn the clothes on those
[1:24:38] Hebrew boys that same God is here
[1:24:41] tonight. If we see those things, they
[1:24:43] are not just Bible stories. They are
[1:24:46] reality. raise our faith, Lord. Let's
[1:24:50] get away from all this uh religious
[1:24:53] spirit and church playing. Let's let's
[1:24:55] go in just like Isaiah. Getting away,
[1:24:59] Father, from uh uh uh just learning how
[1:25:03] to criticize and just gossiping and and
[1:25:05] and and fussing and and just going into
[1:25:09] that chamber and say, "Wo is me, Lord.
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:14] I'm a man of unclean lips.
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:21] and the manifold cleanings.
[1:25:24] [Music]
[1:25:26] Father,
[1:25:27] you know how long we will have to be
[1:25:29] here.
[1:25:32] You know exactly the meaning, the second
[1:25:34] to the rapture.
[1:25:37] Father, you know the the exact time, oh
[1:25:39] God, where we will step into our
[1:25:42] servant,
[1:25:44] where we will step into our mystery.
[1:25:48] You know, Father, Lord, that exact
[1:25:50] moment, it does not come, it's not by
[1:25:52] power or by might. It does not come by
[1:25:55] our hard work. It does not come by our
[1:25:58] smartness.
[1:25:59] It comes by our surrounding to you.
[1:26:04] It comes. I believe Asia went to the
[1:26:06] temple that day frustrated. His good
[1:26:09] friend is dead. He don't know what to
[1:26:11] do.
[1:26:13] But he realized that he needed you. He
[1:26:15] needed something to change.
[1:26:18] He can't continue this way.
[1:26:23] [Music]
[1:26:26] Father,
[1:26:30] you know all Lord God that will become
[1:26:32] of this uh local assembly.
[1:26:38] We can we are doing the best that we
[1:26:40] know how to do Father to be able to
[1:26:43] encourage your people
[1:26:46] to be able to lead them Lord.
[1:26:51] Father,
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:26:56] we're looking forward to God. Father,
[1:26:58] Lord God,
[1:27:01] we are watching that seven. It's a
[1:27:04] mystery.
[1:27:06] I don't know how many
[1:27:09] I don't know the number where we are. I
[1:27:12] can only wish that Lord Father, we are
[1:27:13] in the number of grace.
[1:27:16] I can only wish that Lord God this
[1:27:18] assembly has gone through deliverance.
[1:27:22] Father, maybe we are in the six Lord
[1:27:25] with all our human
[1:27:27] errors and failures just playing around
[1:27:30] us Lord and and we are becoming not very
[1:27:34] concerned.
[1:27:35] [Music]
[1:27:36] But when the seventh come on the scene,
[1:27:39] it's a mystery.
[1:27:42] You brought it for every man in the
[1:27:44] Bible. You brought it for the woman at
[1:27:46] the word. You brought it Lord God for
[1:27:48] now for for Ruth and now me. You're
[1:27:50] going to bring it for us. Lord,
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:55] I pray that God you bless us Lord. Bless
[1:27:58] your children. Oh father God as we as we
[1:28:00] go home and the rest of the week,
[1:28:03] everything we be going about to do. I
[1:28:06] pray that God you will keep each and
[1:28:07] every one of us. Oh, Father,
[1:28:11] bless your people in their home. Lord if
[1:28:13] there is any house of God father that is
[1:28:16] struggling Lord God we pray that oh
[1:28:19] father God
[1:28:22] may it be lifted up Lord God out of
[1:28:25] whatever Lord Jesus
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:30] bring us to that place in our prayer
[1:28:31] life oh God our commitment our devotion
[1:28:35] to you
[1:28:37] I pray Lord Jesus
[1:28:42] Father, we ask for strength, Lord.
[1:28:45] We ask for strength, oh God.
[1:28:49] And all you bring us to that place, Lord
[1:28:51] Jesus, where all our childishness and
[1:28:53] foolishness will be gone away.
[1:28:56] And pretty soon we will know that,
[1:28:58] Father God, it is for this reason you
[1:29:01] have us to be here.
[1:29:05] We love you tonight. We love you
[1:29:07] tonight. Father,
[1:29:11] I wish that Lord, I know that God,
[1:29:13] Father, your children know. Lord God, we

[1:29:20] we come so you can make yourself known
[1:29:22] to us.
[1:29:24] We want to break into something. Lord,
[1:29:26] the prophet said the dynamics of this
[1:29:29] church will be the outpouring of the
[1:29:31] Holy Ghost. Oh, give it to us, Father.
[1:29:34] Give it to us when the young people will
[1:29:37] experience the Holy Ghost. Lord, our
[1:29:39] little children, Father God, something
[1:29:41] that would just be so real to them. Oh
[1:29:43] God,
[1:29:47] we love you tonight. We love you
