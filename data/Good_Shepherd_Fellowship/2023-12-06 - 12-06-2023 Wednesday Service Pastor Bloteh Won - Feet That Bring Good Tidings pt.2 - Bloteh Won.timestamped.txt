[27:29] then we have come back to our subject
[27:32] but
[27:34] uh
[27:42] uh I want
[27:45] to I'm uh
[27:51] feeling okay I'm feeling a little bit
[27:54] tempted
[27:55] to to to get away from there okay let's
[28:00] uh let's just start here and uh and we
[28:03] will'll be able to find find our way
[28:06] through
[28:08] you on Sunday we were trying to talk
[28:10] about blessed at the feet that bringeth
[28:13] good
[28:14] tidings and we were we were we we were
[28:17] trying to
[28:19] identify uh uh uh the faith that have
[28:23] brought us this good Tiding we call the
[28:25] message of the hour and and the benefit
[28:28] of the message of the hour and we were
[28:31] looking at uh uh Revelation chapter 10
[28:36] we were looking at uh
[28:40] the the the mighty Angel having his foot
[28:43] on the land and having his foot on the
[28:46] sea and then we took there to Revelation
[28:49] chapter 13 to be able to show us uh uh
[28:54] why uh the mighty angel had his foot on
[28:57] the land man in the seed because uh out
[29:00] of those both places there were a power
[29:02] that was rising in the earth which of
[29:04] course that is the power that is having
[29:07] the influence upon the world today
[29:09] whether you like it or not praise the
[29:12] Lord so we were trying to show that uh
[29:17] uh
[29:19] uh the mighty Angel uh has to come and
[29:23] stomp those power keep them under his
[29:25] feet and uh uh uh release a message to
[29:29] be able to get his people call his
[29:32] people out get them out of here just
[29:35] before uh uh uh that those BS uh you
[29:40] know uh spread their influence all over
[29:42] the
[29:43] word praise the
[29:46] Lord now so uh uh I want to get back to
[29:50] that but let me give you a little
[29:52] picture here let me give you a little
[29:55] picture so you'll be able to see what
[29:57] what what I want to get to tonight in
[30:00] Luke chapter 10 that we have just
[30:03] read and uh uh Luke is giving an account
[30:07] of Jesus giving the commission to the
[30:12] disciples when Luke gave this account
[30:16] now you have to realize that this is the
[30:18] in the the infancy the beginning the
[30:21] birth of the church the beginning our
[30:24] lord Jesus with his disciples
[30:28] and uh and they they they are beginning
[30:31] to to benefit from his ministry he
[30:35] sending out they have gone out and they
[30:38] are they are casting out uh uh evil
[30:42] spirits and uh and and I mean they all
[30:45] came back and they are all excited yeah
[30:49] very
[30:49] excited and
[30:52] uh uh and
[30:56] Jesus is looking at these brothers and
[30:59] he's telling them I beheld Satan you
[31:03] know they are giving testimony how evil
[31:05] spirits you know are subject unto them
[31:08] and Jesus is telling them i' I have
[31:11] beheld you know you you look there in uh
[31:15] uh Isaiah chapter 14 the Bible says oh
[31:18] how are thou Fallen Lucifer so even from
[31:22] the the the the infancy from the
[31:25] beginning of the church
[31:27] from the going forth of our Lord Jesus
[31:30] ministry even the power of Satan start
[31:34] started to
[31:35] fall praise the Lord amen amen even from
[31:39] the going forth of his ministry the
[31:42] power of Satan begin to fall but that's
[31:45] not where we want to get to tonight
[31:47] Jesus Is Telling these disciples and
[31:50] he's saying to them I beheld Satan
[31:52] falling like a
[31:55] lightning he says uh uh uh
[31:59] but what I want to say to you is that
[32:03] don't Rejoice because you know uh uh
[32:07] those Spirits are subject unto you he
[32:10] said behold I have given you power to
[32:13] tread over uh uh serpents and scorpions
[32:17] and and over all the powers of the enemy
[32:22] praise the Lord amen he has given us
[32:24] power over all the powers of the
[32:29] enemy praise the
[32:31] Lord
[32:37] amen and he says nothing shall by any
[32:41] means hurt you if we can just believe
[32:46] that if we can just trust the Lord and
[32:49] uh to know that uh he has given us power
[32:53] over every Power of the E of the enemy
[32:56] every evil evil power every spiritual
[32:58] power every physical power you know he
[33:01] has given us power over he says nothing
[33:04] by any means will hurts
[33:06] you now we're standing in this Rejoice
[33:10] net praise the Lord you know we we uh uh
[33:16] we uh uh in such a time where
[33:20] the
[33:22] uh the the the religious word the church
[33:26] word uh and and is uh desire for power
[33:31] you know we we want to see manifestation
[33:34] you know there that's one of the place
[33:36] that we want for us to go tonight we uh
[33:39] the the church long to see manifestation
[33:42] and and because of the longing for
[33:46] manifestation we have a bunch of uh uh
[33:50] uh um counterfeit we have a bunch of
[33:54] impersonation we have uh a whole whole
[33:57] lot of things that is going on around
[33:59] the church world because people are
[34:01] yearning for power people want to
[34:03] demonstrate the power of God but yet
[34:07] Jesus is telling his disciple and he
[34:10] says uh uh I mean that that is not what
[34:12] you should rejoice in you know uh uh
[34:16] that the spirits are subject to you
[34:18] demons are subject to you that is not
[34:20] what you should rejoice in you know what
[34:23] I want you to rejoice in is that uh your
[34:27] names are
[34:29] written in
[34:31] heaven amen that your names are written
[34:34] in heaven now look at this you think
[34:37] about this now Jesus was saying
[34:41] this he was saying this and uh uh uh
[34:47] even John the the the
[34:51] Beloved he was sitting right among the
[34:54] disciples he was sitting there in Jesus
[34:57] was saying this and you see it's one of
[34:59] these places where sometimes things are
[35:01] said and they just go over our head
[35:05] praise the Lord amen because you see
[35:09] what the way the church will look at it
[35:12] is that they think they will get to
[35:15] heaven before they see their names in
[35:17] the
[35:20] book they are waiting to go to heaven
[35:23] before you know uh uh a book will be
[35:26] open and they will see their name in the
[35:29] book but we we we realize that uh uh uh
[35:34] no this is is it is not
[35:37] so the the the the seals have been taken
[35:41] off the book praise the Lord and when
[35:44] the mysteries in the book are released
[35:48] when the mystery in the book are uh have
[35:51] been called out we hear our
[35:55] names praise the Lord
[35:58] amen so we see here that John is sitting
[36:01] there and uh and Jesus is saying Rejoice
[36:06] n because uh you know uh uh you are
[36:09] casting our spirit so I mean to to them
[36:11] it looking like this is where the
[36:13] excitement is you know to be able to go
[36:16] down there and see someone uh that is
[36:18] sick you pray for them and they are
[36:20] healed somebody that is possessed with
[36:22] evil spirit you pray for them and they
[36:23] are delivered that's where the
[36:25] excitement is it's it's a exting to be
[36:27] able to see
[36:29] that but Jesus is saying
[36:34] no where I want for you to look is
[36:38] uh that your names are in the
[36:43] book that your names are written in the
[36:47] book The Book of the Lamb are we
[36:51] together and John is sitting
[36:55] there John that was on the island of
[36:59] pmos is sitting right in that meeting
[37:02] but when Jesus said that he never grabed
[37:04] it he never got aside
[37:10] it and never grabed his
[37:14] attention because he's looking at
[37:16] something else they are looking at what
[37:18] is happening there the healing of the
[37:19] sick and and the casting out of evil
[37:22] spirit but then after some years
[37:27] John will now find himself on the island
[37:30] of
[37:31] pmos and then he will now be in this
[37:35] Vision where the Lord Jesus Christ would
[37:38] now be revealing to him the things that
[37:42] he's doing in the
[37:44] church and John will find himself right
[37:48] there in in Revelation chapter 5 when
[37:51] the lamb takes the
[37:52] book and the
[37:54] lamb is uh is is uh uh uh uh taking the
[37:58] seals of the book praise the Lord first
[38:03] when the Bible says that no man was wed
[38:05] to take the book and even to look upon
[38:08] it
[38:09] John the scripture said he be to
[38:13] weep praise the Lord amen he started
[38:17] weeping because there was no man wanted
[38:20] to take the book but when he heard the
[38:23] proclamation thatth the lion of the Trap
[38:26] of Judah has prevailed and he will take
[38:29] the book praise the Lord and loose the
[38:32] seals from off the book and when John
[38:36] looked he saw the lamb and the lamb took
[38:38] the book a bleeding
[38:40] lamb but the Bible says the very same
[38:44] John that was
[38:46] weeping when the lamb took the book
[38:50] praise the Lord and loose the seals of
[38:53] the book The Bible said John said he
[38:56] shouted he rejoiced that all Heaven
[39:00] heard him and all Earth held him but
[39:03] long ago Jesus told him to Rejoice
[39:07] because his name was in the
[39:09] book but it went over his
[39:12] head praise the Lord
[39:16] amen even though he heard
[39:19] it but he couldn't get the excitement to
[39:23] Rejoice because he heard it but he but
[39:27] he at the time he have not seen his name
[39:29] in the
[39:32] book but on the Allen Theos when the
[39:35] lamb took the book and starts to take up
[39:39] the seals from off the book then John
[39:42] saw his name the reality of what Jesus
[39:45] told them in in Matthew chapter 17
[39:48] struck him this is what he said we
[39:51] should not rejoice in this is the actual
[39:55] thing
[39:58] praise the
[39:59] Lord so see the reverse of the
[40:02] church praise the Lord amen we will talk
[40:07] about the the mighty angel coming down
[40:10] we would talk about God send a message
[40:12] God sent a messenger the people would
[40:14] just stare at you and look at you in
[40:16] your
[40:18] face this is the message of the
[40:24] hour but what will make the Church get
[40:28] excited when you see a
[40:32] manifestation praise the Lord the very
[40:35] thing that Jesus told us not to rejoice
[40:37] in that's why we rejoice
[40:39] in the one he told us to rejoice in we
[40:43] are still
[40:44] skeptical we are sitting back praise the
[40:48] Lord amen amen we are still sitting back
[40:53] you and myself under the message of the
[40:55] hour we are looking right into the book
[40:58] the very same book that John looked in
[41:01] and he saw his
[41:03] name praise the lord we are looking
[41:06] right in that book as we said H the
[41:08] message of the
[41:14] hour but you will see as the church
[41:18] travel there something I want to bring
[41:20] to you tonight and I pray that uh that
[41:24] the Lord will
[41:27] will uh will be able to help us
[41:35] tonight and

[41:46] once more Lord I'm trying to get away
[41:49] from it but I still feel the need that
[41:51] we should read it so let's just read it
[41:54] tonight and uh uh
[41:56] you will bear with me this this
[41:58] ginine uh we will we try to to read it

[42:06] year of uh of a of a
[42:09] family and this
[42:12] family uh if you if you see the book uh
[42:17] uh a prophet visit South Africa it is
[42:21] actually the brother that read that uh
[42:23] that uh that print that book he was in
[42:26] the military and uh uh I think either he
[42:30] was serving in Germany at the time or he
[42:33] was from Germany and uh because when
[42:36] brother brandham was to go to Germany uh
[42:39] you hear on tape how brother brandham
[42:41] says that uh you know he had to go and
[42:44] speak to his Superior officer to get
[42:45] brother Brandon in at the time but he's
[42:48] the one that wrote the book The Prophet
[42:51] visit South Africa so brother Brandon
[42:53] will come in here he was preaching this
[42:56] message in strapo uh Louisiana he says I
[43:00] guess brother Julius has been introduced
[43:03] the man who wrote the book a prophet
[43:06] visit South
[43:08] Africa and he he he called his wife name
[43:11] sister uh uh
[43:14] stealing no doubt is here somewhere I
[43:18] can't place her just right he said yes
[43:21] now I do he see where she's sitting he
[43:24] says uh I remember a few years ago
[43:29] Minneapolis they were uh little bitty
[43:33] fellow now I have to look up to them
[43:37] they are a great big boys and girl and
[43:40] then he you know he talks about the
[43:43] sister and uh uh just just follow me a
[43:47] little bit here he says
[43:53] uh our sister year long ago that's
[43:57] really
[44:00] how that's that that really had my heart
[44:04] willing around a little mother she lost
[44:07] her
[44:09] baby she lost her baby and the Lord
[44:13] seemed fi to take it
[44:15] away and she did call me and wanted they
[44:19] were going to fly me over to Germany the
[44:23] doctor was so kind to wait
[44:26] and let the baby live there the little
[44:29] fellow died
[44:30] suddenly uh sweet little uh plumpy bab
[44:36] girl the uh our sister had lost her
[44:39] mother and she and and and she was uh
[44:43] pretty well broken up this baby
[44:45] certainly had got the best of her now
[44:49] she lost her mom so here say she's
[44:51] expecting to have a baby guil and and
[44:53] know the the baby is born little baby
[44:56] and so it was almost like a comfort to
[44:59] her but yet yet the baby is sick and the
[45:01] baby has died so brother Bram as he goes
[45:04] on here that's that's somewh I want to
[45:06] bring you with this
[45:09] tonight and uh as he talks about this uh
[45:13] this mother the baby certainly had got
[45:15] the best of
[45:17] her and she got on the phone long
[45:20] distance from Germany and wanted to fly
[45:23] over and uh uh she confessed her faith
[45:27] that she believed that the Lord Jesus
[45:30] has sent me for the work in the last day
[45:34] and just a loyal testimony that no one
[45:39] could give and she meant it with all her
[45:43] heart she uh she seen the Lord God do
[45:47] such things as that rais up the dead
[45:50] after they were dead but you see you
[45:53] really he says how what what what a
[45:57] glory that would have been to God in
[45:59] Germany in in everything if I could have
[46:03] done it myself I will have done it but
[46:06] the first thing we must we mustn't go
[46:10] until we know what we are going
[46:14] for so I went out and I prayed and uh I
[46:19] think she stayed on the phone part of
[46:22] the time through the night yes the
[46:24] mother that have lost her
[46:27] baby and she uh believed this man to be
[46:31] a man of God with all the testimony
[46:34] around his
[46:35] ministry and uh uh uh the testimony
[46:39] about uh uh Florence naill and and all
[46:43] of that the boy in Finland and she
[46:46] begged the doctors to keep her baby
[46:48] laying there let me talk to my pastor or
[46:51] let me talk to that servant of God from
[46:53] the United States and they were ready to
[46:56] get brother brandham on a military
[46:57] flight and fly him over to Germany and
[47:00] all of that and brother brandham saying
[47:03] that uh uh uh I mean U uh she belied now
[47:08] what what I want to show you also is
[47:11] there are the this thing has already
[47:13] happened okay what we are reading have
[47:15] already happened they have come down
[47:18] over to the United States they are there
[47:19] in streeto they right in the meeting
[47:21] brother bham is preaching but yet he
[47:23] feel like to commend her for her faith
[47:27] praise the Lord are we
[47:30] together now so he says
[47:33] here uh um she was on the phone all
[47:37] through the night the next day I coming
[47:40] there was nothing again me that said my
[47:43] wife she said the sister called twice H
[47:47] any word from the Lord yet I said not
[47:49] not a think well uh I went out and
[47:53] prayed again I was in a w that night
[47:55] night then CA a little baby have been
[47:59] taken care of and and then just just as
[48:03] I was coming in the Lord Jesus in a
[48:06] vision struck standing in front of me
[48:10] and I heard his voice don't rebuke
[48:15] that that's the hand of the Lord so I
[48:19] knew then that God for some reason has
[48:24] taken the baby to Glory
[48:26] and it was certainly against his will
[48:29] for me to say anything contrary to death
[48:32] now you think about it now it has
[48:34] already happened they have they have
[48:37] they have buried a baby she's in the
[48:39] service and brother Bram is commenting
[48:41] her faith now there is two things that
[48:43] is playing out here faith and
[48:47] feelings praise the Lord amen she just
[48:51] lost her baby this is a mother maybe she
[48:54] will have named the baby after her
[48:56] mother her mother passed away the baby
[48:59] was some sense of
[49:01] comfort and she have asked ask the
[49:05] doctors keep the baby down there I
[49:07] believe God will give brother Brandon a
[49:09] word we will fly him over to to Gering
[49:12] he will pray for my baby the baby will
[49:13] wake up brother Braham said it will have
[49:15] been a witness to gine and everywhere
[49:19] else are we together amen
[49:24] but
[49:27] the Lord says don't rebuke
[49:29] that that's my hand so I knew then that
[49:33] uh for some reason the Lord had taken
[49:35] the baby to glory and it was certainly
[49:39] against his will the word of the Lord
[49:41] for for me to say anything contrary to
[49:44] it then I thought
[49:46] well that will be a big let down now the
[49:51] Lord have just spoken to him he's now
[49:53] supposed to take the phone and and call
[49:55] the
[49:56] sister praise the
[50:00] Lord amen it's amazing to listen to it
[50:04] it's another thing when you are wearing
[50:06] the
[50:11] shoes are we
[50:24] together he says that's a big let down
[50:27] but one thing I did I minded the Lord I
[50:33] did what he told
[50:35] me don't rebuke
[50:38] it praise the
[50:41] Lord he says I did what God told me to
[50:46] do and he had to some of the courage and
[50:49] tell the sister that's the hand of the
[50:53] Lord praise the Lord
[50:57] amen now think about that now like I
[51:00] said it has already
[51:03] happened now a mother like that in that
[51:09] situation will stay travel from Germany
[51:13] and come to a service to H H in a
[51:16] service of a preacher that you believe
[51:19] and H you were looking up
[51:24] to
[51:26] to save your
[51:30] baby after hearing what happened in the
[51:32] life of floring Nale and what happened
[51:34] in the life in the board there in
[51:36] Finland and and all of the the the other
[51:39] things that God has done through the
[51:40] ministry of brother Bram and now this is
[51:43] your
[51:46] turn praise the
[51:49] Lord but you see I think it was an
[51:52] honorable thing for brother Bram to do
[51:55] because he would just he will let us
[51:57] know now as we as we read down a little
[51:59] bit it was an honorable thing for him to
[52:01] do I mean he was he was appreciating the
[52:03] faith of the sister that you will be
[52:05] sitting in the meeting year tonight what
[52:07] a great
[52:11] faith but you can also think of uh the
[52:15] emotion that was going through her
[52:19] body what he was trying to do what what
[52:22] were brother Braham trying to do to
[52:23] raise her faith above her
[52:25] emotions
[52:27] amen now let's let's read on a little
[52:30] bit here I need to get into what I want
[52:32] to talk about I wanted to do this for
[52:34] the prayer
[52:35] meeting not long ago he says a letter
[52:39] from a minister a German Lutheran n show
[52:42] he said uh uh there's one thing that I
[52:45] can admire about brother Brandon when
[52:48] all the excitement was going
[52:51] on now yeah there was there was an
[52:54] excitement that was going on an
[52:57] expectation everybody was
[53:00] excited praise the Lord amen they were
[53:03] all looking for him to fly over when all
[53:06] the excitement was going on he said he
[53:10] still steady till he got a clearical
[53:12] decision from
[53:14] God then he know what he was doing and
[53:19] that's the only way you can do those
[53:21] things is uh first year from the Lord
[53:25] when he tells if he tells me tonight to
[53:28] go up there and raise out raise out of
[53:33] that Cemetery President Kennedy I will
[53:35] invite the whole world to come and wash
[53:37] it done for I have th said the
[53:42] Lord but how can I say thus said the
[53:45] Lord until the Lord has said
[53:48] thus now learn from this now he says
[53:51] many people get all
[53:53] excited and go on the impression and
[53:57] things like
[53:59] that and what the best of their Mentor
[54:03] can
[54:04] think because we are believing God it's
[54:08] God that we are calling upon God will
[54:10] not let us down yeah it's a it's a it's
[54:13] a it's a good
[54:18] reasoning are we
[54:21] together many people can get all excited
[54:24] and go on the in depression and things
[54:26] like that that's what the best of their
[54:28] Mentor can think that are always truth
[54:32] wait till he tells you and you know it
[54:36] then you have got exactly you don't have
[54:39] to guess about it he's done told you
[54:42] thus said the Lord then he told you and
[54:45] then you can go and say what he says
[54:47] until then you can go and do everything
[54:51] you can do what you can yourself but you
[54:55] can't be sure until God has said so then
[54:59] you are positive praise the Lord are we
[55:06] together I was I was listening to this
[55:08] couple of days and and it just it just
[55:12] uh
[55:15] uh I just stopped the tape and and then
[55:18] I started thinking about it you know
[55:21] Word of Faith you know we we we read
[55:24] about martyr and and Mary when Lazar was
[55:28] dead and brother Brandon was says how
[55:29] they sent for Jesus and uh he never came
[55:33] it was that time you see it's very easy
[55:36] to read those things but uh when we have
[55:39] to wear those shoes and we have to get
[55:42] into those places you know uh uh where
[55:45] you will trust the grace of God to raise
[55:48] your faith above your emotions that you
[55:51] can stay believe God you can still
[55:53] believe his word you can still believe
[55:56] the message of the hour when we are in
[55:58] such time of trouble praise the
[56:01] Lord amen and uh uh then brother bro
[56:06] says this also here in the message God
[56:09] uh uh provided way the devil is not a
[56:12] Healer he says Simon the Sorcerer was
[56:17] bewitching the people not healing the
[56:20] people it was Phillip that done the
[56:24] healing and CA a great Revival to sweep
[56:26] the city Philip by the name of Jesus
[56:29] Christ he cast out devil and caused a
[56:31] great joy and they were streaming and
[56:34] shouting and having a great time and
[56:38] still didn't have the Holy Ghost that
[56:40] Samra Revival the Revival in Samra they
[56:43] had to now send for Peter they were
[56:46] experiencing all of that great revival
[56:49] going on he was casting out Devils he
[56:51] was healing the S but he did not have
[56:53] the Holy Ghost
[56:56] until Peter comes now you see why Jesus
[56:59] told the disciple in the emphasis of the
[57:02] church that don't rejoice in these
[57:06] things it's those are things that brings
[57:09] excitement when we when we have
[57:11] manifestation and we we hear that God
[57:13] you know heal the siake and and I and I
[57:15] pray for this person and God it it it
[57:17] raises faith it causing
[57:21] excitement but he said this is what this
[57:24] is where I want your joy to
[57:27] be that you
[57:30] know not that someone tell you that you
[57:33] know and for you to know is for you to
[57:36] have a
[57:38] revelation that your name is in the
[57:43] book praise the Lord that your name is
[57:46] in the
[57:48] book oh we would we would thank God for
[57:51] the healing of the sick we would thank
[57:52] God for all the the the the
[57:55] manifestation of the word but the thing
[57:57] that Rejoice us is when the word is
[58:00] calling out our
[58:02] names amen it's when the word is
[58:06] revealing things to
[58:08] us are we together let me show you

[1:00:32] book was sealed no man could could could
[1:00:35] read what was in it no man could touch
[1:00:37] it but yet Revelation 6 verse1 saying I
[1:00:41] saw when the lamb opened the seal and I
[1:00:45] heard as it was the noise of a
[1:00:49] thunder one of the four beasts one of
[1:00:52] the four beasts that we read about in
[1:00:53] Revelation chap chapter
[1:00:55] 4 one of the four beasts is saying to
[1:01:00] John come and
[1:01:02] see so let me let me let me give it a
[1:01:06] type here the book was
[1:01:09] sealed the lamb has break the seal of
[1:01:12] the
[1:01:13] book he has bro the Seal of the book and
[1:01:17] now he's calling to
[1:01:20] John and you we have to realize tonight
[1:01:23] that we are at type of
[1:01:26] John amen Jesus is saying
[1:01:31] Rejoice rejoice in the content of the
[1:01:34] book are we together
[1:01:38] amen we are a type of John John is a
[1:01:41] type of the Bride now the seven Angel is
[1:01:45] calling to John come and see the lamb
[1:01:47] has opened the book and the Seven Angel
[1:01:50] is telling John come and see so now the
[1:01:54] angel now is beginning to show John the
[1:01:58] content that is in the
[1:02:00] book why because it is those Divine
[1:02:04] mystery
[1:02:06] truth are we together amen
[1:02:14] amen I don't want to lose you
[1:02:17] tonight praise the Lord amen I don't
[1:02:20] want to lose you
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:23] tonight
[1:02:25] but brother brandham says the
[1:02:28] messenger of Malachi 4 and revelation
[1:02:32] 10:7 we do two
[1:02:37] things are we
[1:02:40] together I call
[1:02:43] in to Revelation
[1:02:46] 7 he's going to reveal the Mysteries
[1:02:50] you're going to reveal the mystery of
[1:02:52] God Amen
[1:02:55] according to Malachi 4 he's supposed to
[1:02:58] turn our heart back to the faith of the
[1:03:03] fathers praise the Lord amen so brother
[1:03:08] brandom said it is those Divine mystery
[1:03:12] truth the the the the what what uh uh
[1:03:15] will be revealed by the the seven Angel
[1:03:20] is those Divine mystery truth that will
[1:03:22] turn our hearts back back praise the
[1:03:26] Lord amen that's what we turn it will
[1:03:29] literally turn our hearts back so when
[1:03:32] when we begin to see and understand the
[1:03:37] things that were in the sealed
[1:03:42] book that's the thing that would turn
[1:03:45] our heart back it is not us trying to to
[1:03:49] to to behave like the people on the days
[1:03:51] of Pentecost and say let's come together
[1:03:54] in want a
[1:03:55] c because we want to produce a
[1:03:58] Pentecostal
[1:03:59] church or we want to get that we we want
[1:04:03] the Holy Ghost to come just like it came
[1:04:05] on the day no no no no no
[1:04:07] no the thing that would turn our heart
[1:04:11] back to the faith of the
[1:04:14] fathers it's not even the working of
[1:04:17] Miracles and
[1:04:23] signs praise the Lord so you see Jesus
[1:04:27] says I will give you
[1:04:30] power
[1:04:32] now as he opened the book he opened the
[1:04:36] seals book and the angel is speaking to
[1:04:40] John and saying come and see now when
[1:04:43] these things are revealed to John when
[1:04:46] John see it that's what makes John an
[1:04:50] overcomer praise the
[1:04:53] Lord
[1:04:55] are we
[1:04:59] together are you are you grapping the
[1:05:01] picture amen that's the things that make
[1:05:05] John an overcomer is is is the
[1:05:07] revelation of the word is is the things
[1:05:10] that I that I
[1:05:12] reveal that were under the
[1:05:23] seals are we
[1:05:34] together let's go to Revelation chapter
[1:05:37] 10 I'm trying
[1:05:39] to Revelation chapter 10:7 that is that
[1:05:43] is one of our
[1:05:44] favorite uh
[1:05:48] verse that speaks of the ministrat of
[1:05:51] brother
[1:05:53] Brandon the ministry that we are
[1:05:57] honored I want for us to pay attention
[1:06:00] as we read
[1:06:01] that as we read there
[1:06:19] together
[1:06:23] amen
[1:06:24] if you read from Revelation chapter 1 I
[1:06:27] think we took I mean revelation 10:1 we
[1:06:30] took that uh before John
[1:06:35] have
[1:06:37] six conjunctions before he get to verse
[1:06:43] 7 if you read from Revelation chap 10
[1:06:45] verse1 he have six conjunction and in
[1:06:49] the day of the voice of the seven
[1:06:53] angel
[1:06:54] oh let me let me know let me get there
[1:06:58] just keep Revelation chapter 10:7 up I'm
[1:07:00] coming that's what I want to read but I
[1:07:02] just I just want to do
[1:07:05] this from verse one he says and I saw
[1:07:08] another Mighty Angel and I saw that's uh
[1:07:11] that's one conjunction in verse two he
[1:07:13] said and he had his hands he he had in
[1:07:17] his hands a little book
[1:07:19] open verse three and he cried so he has
[1:07:23] Si
[1:07:26] conjunctions praise the Lord but when he
[1:07:29] gets to Revelation chapter he gets to
[1:07:32] verse 7 he has another conjunction but
[1:07:36] it's a conjunction that that is either
[1:07:39] creating an expectation or is creating a
[1:07:43] contast when he says but in the days of
[1:07:47] the voice of the seven
[1:07:51] Angel so it's creating an expect
[1:07:54] ation he's telling us about this Mighty
[1:07:57] Angel and and I saw another Mighty Angel
[1:08:00] and he had in his hands a little book
[1:08:03] and he cried with a loud voice verse
[1:08:05] four and when the seven tunel open verse
[1:08:08] 5 and the angel which I saw verse six
[1:08:11] and he sore he he has all of these
[1:08:14] conjunctions but when he get to verse
[1:08:17] seven he brings another
[1:08:20] conjunction that create an expectation
[1:08:24] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:08:27] seven
[1:08:29] Angel when he shall begin to
[1:08:34] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:08:40] finished praise the Lord so when this
[1:08:43] Angel is sounding he's now sounding the
[1:08:46] mystery when he starts to sound the
[1:08:49] Mysteries are already
[1:08:52] finished
[1:08:57] praise the
[1:08:59] Lord
[1:09:01] amen now watch there now one thing I
[1:09:05] want for you for us to pay attention to
[1:09:07] when when when uh when this Angels shall
[1:09:10] begin to sound the mystery of
[1:09:14] God one
[1:09:18] mystery the mystery of
[1:09:22] God should be
[1:09:27] finished praise the
[1:09:33] Lord as he have declared to his servants
[1:09:36] the prophet now brother Brandon will
[1:09:38] explain to us in Christ is the mystery
[1:09:40] of God revealed that it was one mystery
[1:09:44] with a threefold
[1:09:49] purpose so in Christ is the mystery of
[1:09:52] God revealed that's that's that's where
[1:09:54] he actually explained what Revelation
[1:09:56] 10:7 is it's just one mystery but it
[1:10:00] have a three-fold
[1:10:05] purpose are we together amen okay now so
[1:10:11] uh uh uh uh there there are few things
[1:10:15] that he said in that in that light that
[1:10:18] I also want to bring to your attention
[1:10:20] here because uh uh you know I'm I'm I'm
[1:10:23] trying to to what what I'm trying to to
[1:10:26] do with this as we talk about blessed is
[1:10:29] the feat that brings us Good Tidings
[1:10:32] Yeah because sometimes you know uh uh uh
[1:10:37] uh uh people get excited with uh with uh
[1:10:42] you know uh
[1:10:45] um the car that deliver the post uh mail
[1:10:49] then the the content of the mail people
[1:10:51] get excited with the one that bring
[1:10:53] brings the message then the message
[1:10:55] itself and and and all of that but what
[1:10:58] what I'm trying to to to to help us uh
[1:11:02] to get to a little bit here is that uh
[1:11:06] uh um
[1:11:07] unless the the Lord help us to be able
[1:11:11] to see what that seven Angel brought to
[1:11:15] us when he told us come and see unless
[1:11:19] he help us to be able to understand what
[1:11:22] what are we seeing
[1:11:24] we would we would just be like any other
[1:11:27] Church you see that's the reason why you
[1:11:29] find a whole lot of people around the
[1:11:31] message that just settle for water
[1:11:35] baptism in Jesus
[1:11:38] name to them that's the
[1:11:41] message there are a lot of people around
[1:11:43] the message that just settle well I
[1:11:45] believe brother brand well you know I I
[1:11:47] I I I don't know what the 720 but I
[1:11:49] believe brother Bram is the
[1:11:52] messenger
[1:11:54] praise the
[1:11:55] Lord when the angel told John to come
[1:11:58] and see the angel was pointing to the
[1:12:01] book he was pointing to the thing that
[1:12:04] was under the
[1:12:07] seals you read Revelation chapter
[1:12:10] chapter 6 verse 2 and the second beast
[1:12:13] called unto John come and
[1:12:17] see and is seeing those things that gave
[1:12:21] the church the power that she should
[1:12:23] have in the last
[1:12:27] day seeing those things that are under
[1:12:30] the seals seeing our names in the lamb
[1:12:33] Book of
[1:12:35] Life praise the
[1:12:38] Lord because when you can hear when you
[1:12:41] can hear your name when you can hear the
[1:12:44] voice of God and you know that this
[1:12:47] voice is speaking to me praise the
[1:12:51] Lord because when someone for example
[1:12:54] when someone get out there and and and
[1:12:56] and they are talking to everybody you
[1:12:58] get interested in the message they are
[1:13:01] saying because you know they are talking
[1:13:03] to
[1:13:05] you praise the Lord
[1:13:10] amen we know definitely the names H the
[1:13:15] lamb is not calling our name you know
[1:13:17] brother ju and brother Steve and brother
[1:13:19] John it's not the names that he's
[1:13:21] calling he's he's he's is bringing forth
[1:13:24] his word and that word is identifying
[1:13:27] you as a Son of God that word is
[1:13:30] identifying you as a daughter of God it
[1:13:32] has quickened something in you that is
[1:13:35] giving you an interest to listen to the
[1:13:37] voice of
[1:13:40] God praise the Lord am you find people
[1:13:44] around the message all that you know the
[1:13:47] the they love the dress Cod they love
[1:13:49] the songs but yet they will be able to
[1:13:52] take all the
[1:13:54] opinion above the opinion from the word
[1:13:57] of God the opinion from the message of
[1:14:00] the
[1:14:05] hour praise the
[1:14:16] Lord are we
[1:14:19] together I hope you are getting the
[1:14:21] picture if you don't get it we have
[1:14:23] another time to get back to it I really
[1:14:27] wanted for you to see it getting close
[1:14:29] to my time here tonight listen to what
[1:14:31] brother brandom says
[1:14:32] here in the
[1:14:34] bridge I read few of them tonight he
[1:14:37] says at the sounding of the seventh
[1:14:41] Church age the last Church age all the
[1:14:44] Loose
[1:14:46] Ends that through these Church
[1:14:50] ages have been pro at will be W up
[1:14:55] together now listen to this now and when
[1:14:58] the seals are broke and the Mystery is
[1:15:02] revealed down comes the angel the
[1:15:06] messenger
[1:15:08] Christ setting his foot upon the land
[1:15:13] and upon the sea with a rainbow over his
[1:15:16] head now remember the seven Angel is on
[1:15:22] Earth at the time of this
[1:15:27] coming
[1:15:30] Hallelujah
[1:15:32] okay let me give you a Biblical
[1:15:36] type John was
[1:15:40] at the River
[1:15:44] Jordan and he was telling the people
[1:15:46] behold the kingdom of God cometh unto
[1:15:48] you and he was rebuking the people and
[1:15:51] he was you know uh
[1:15:53] uh rebuking the soldiers uh he even
[1:15:56] rebuked Herod from uh uh uh sleeping
[1:16:00] with his brother's wife and and he was
[1:16:02] preaching but he told them he says there
[1:16:05] is one among you who
[1:16:09] shoes I'm now worthy to lose the lashes
[1:16:13] of his
[1:16:15] shoes praise the
[1:16:17] Lord
[1:16:19] amen now he was the Forerunner
[1:16:23] he was the messenger of that
[1:16:27] time but as he was bringing his message
[1:16:30] he was also
[1:16:32] identifying that the Messiah is
[1:16:39] here are we
[1:16:42] together he was also identifying that
[1:16:45] there is one among
[1:16:48] you whose shoes are now wanted to
[1:16:52] lose
[1:16:53] and then when Jesus will come down and
[1:16:57] John the first time he would see him
[1:17:00] there was an inner
[1:17:03] connection and then Jesus will come
[1:17:06] right down into the water you remember
[1:17:08] what happened there at J and he will say
[1:17:10] tell John is behold to fulfill all
[1:17:13] righteousness and John will baptize
[1:17:15] Jesus and as Jesus will go out of the
[1:17:18] river he will says Behold the Lamb of
[1:17:21] God that takes away the sin of the
[1:17:25] word praise the
[1:17:27] Lord are we together amen amen so
[1:17:32] brother brandham is trying to help us to
[1:17:35] see that a similar repetition is taking
[1:17:39] place in our
[1:17:44] day glory be to
[1:17:48] God because let let me let me let me get
[1:17:51] myself here trying to get excited but
[1:17:54] let me get myself together because you
[1:17:56] see we can we can look for messages to
[1:18:00] chase you about all the petty things you
[1:18:02] know uh you know don't do this you know
[1:18:04] you shouldn't stay home on Wednesday
[1:18:06] night you shouldn't I mean all of those
[1:18:08] things we can find a message and just
[1:18:10] wind you up and think we can preach
[1:18:12] these things together to you uh uh but
[1:18:14] the reality there is that what get a
[1:18:16] hold of us is what is in the
[1:18:21] book it's what the lamb has
[1:18:25] revealed because when John saw his name
[1:18:29] in The Lamb Book of Life no one could
[1:18:32] stop him he didn't care whether it was
[1:18:35] before the throne he didn't care whether
[1:18:37] there were Angel the Bible says he
[1:18:39] shouted he
[1:18:43] rejoiced that is the thing that St the
[1:18:46] thing for the for a
[1:18:50] Believer when a Believer knows that uh H
[1:18:54] H uh the voice of God has called out my
[1:19:00] name praise the
[1:19:02] Lord when a Believer gets that
[1:19:05] Revelation that I am a Son of God a
[1:19:08] daughter of God predestinated by God I
[1:19:11] was in the mind of God from the
[1:19:13] foundation of the
[1:19:18] word praise the
[1:19:21] Lord when a Believer get an
[1:19:24] understanding that I'm in a body that
[1:19:27] will never be converted this is a Croc
[1:19:29] of it will struggle it will struggle but
[1:19:31] down in mean there is a representation
[1:19:34] for God there is something that is
[1:19:36] longing more for
[1:19:37] God then you don't stumble at your
[1:19:42] flaws you have your Triumph but there is
[1:19:45] something in you that keep pushing you
[1:19:47] to serve God that's when you hearing
[1:19:50] your name from the
[1:19:51] book
[1:19:56] we can write all the all the rules of
[1:19:58] the church put it right on the board
[1:20:00] when you want to come to this church
[1:20:01] this is how long your dress should be
[1:20:03] this is it does not
[1:20:06] change it does not
[1:20:14] change what change the individual is
[1:20:18] when you hear your name amen praise the
[1:20:21] Lord
[1:20:24] Lazarus was a de body been there four
[1:20:28] days praise the Lord and he was in
[1:20:33] B in B never started now praise the Lord
[1:20:38] he was in B what changed him from a dead
[1:20:41] man back to a living man was not them
[1:20:45] washing his body and no what changed him
[1:20:48] was the voice of God when Jesus said
[1:20:51] Lazarus come forth
[1:20:53] that's what changed
[1:21:07] him praise the
[1:21:15] Lord this is a Wednesday
[1:21:19] night this is a Wednesday night
[1:21:25] are we
[1:21:26] together listen to what brother Braham
[1:21:28] said here in the Rapture
[1:21:31] message praise the
[1:21:34] Lord like I said on Sunday we're not
[1:21:37] making a
[1:21:39] church we're not making the church we
[1:21:41] are following the voice than
[1:21:47] amen that Mighty angel came
[1:21:50] down with one thought
[1:21:53] on the land and one foot on the seal on
[1:21:56] the
[1:21:57] sea and he had the book in his
[1:22:01] hands and your representation was in
[1:22:04] that
[1:22:05] book
[1:22:07] amen as he puts his foot on the land and
[1:22:10] on the seal when he begin to he he begin
[1:22:14] to reveal the Mysteries that is in the
[1:22:17] book he begin to call out the names the
[1:22:21] attributes that were in the book
[1:22:23] that's the thing that brings
[1:22:26] you praise the Lord and when that thing
[1:22:30] brings
[1:22:32] you all the father has given to me Jesus
[1:22:35] said will
[1:22:38] come praise the Lord so when that thing
[1:22:41] brings you what happened actually is
[1:22:44] that he he Deliver Us from uh uh the
[1:22:49] religious power of the Beast system and
[1:22:52] the power power of the Council of
[1:22:53] churches he Deliver Us from all the
[1:22:56] political system of the world the
[1:22:58] national system that the ESS system in
[1:23:01] all of those things because he put his
[1:23:04] foot on those
[1:23:06] things praise the
[1:23:08] Lord
[1:23:10] amen that's why Jesus says I give you
[1:23:16] power the power is in what he has
[1:23:18] already
[1:23:21] done
[1:23:23] over every
[1:23:25] enemy is not something that we have to
[1:23:28] work out nor we have to believe what he
[1:23:31] have already given to
[1:23:36] us are we together now let's read this
[1:23:40] and then we find a place to close here
[1:23:41] listen to this from the message the
[1:23:43] Rapture I triy I will try to go around
[1:23:46] this and see if uh I can be able to to
[1:23:49] really get it to
[1:23:51] you
[1:23:56] because if NAD will start preaching
[1:23:58] Pentecostal message to you you know
[1:24:02] Pentecostal message is all about dress
[1:24:04] code it's all about uh you know trying
[1:24:06] to make a holy people
[1:24:09] no it's the word that watches
[1:24:12] us it's the word that cleanses us is the
[1:24:16] word that dresses us
[1:24:19] am praise the Lord the Bible said he has
[1:24:23] made us priests and Kings unto our
[1:24:28] God and just like when God would set out
[1:24:32] the Leviticus
[1:24:33] priesthood it was a prophet Moses that
[1:24:37] he told call your brother Aaron and his
[1:24:41] sons so it's a prophet that called to
[1:24:44] the priesthood office you don't join
[1:24:48] it you have to come under the voice of a
[1:24:52] prophet
[1:24:53] you see that's the thing that Coran and
[1:24:55] dayon never understood they were all of
[1:24:58] the tribe of
[1:24:59] levite the
[1:25:01] Leviticus the Levites had a work to do
[1:25:04] but when it comes to the the the calling
[1:25:07] to the priesthood office God told Moses
[1:25:11] call Aaron and his
[1:25:13] sons so Moses will call them and then
[1:25:17] when they come there over in The Book of
[1:25:18] Leviticus the Bible says Moses will wash
[1:25:21] them before for the
[1:25:23] congregation praise the Lord so that
[1:25:26] Prophet word will do the watching that
[1:25:29] Prophet word will go and dress them for
[1:25:32] the priesthood office that Prophet word
[1:25:36] will anoint them for the priesthood
[1:25:41] office praise the
[1:25:45] Lord you see that's the reason why in in
[1:25:48] the present stage of my Ministry brother
[1:25:50] brandham says he says uh uh uh the
[1:25:52] crowning of my ministry will be what to
[1:25:55] dress the bride
[1:26:01] am okay let's read this then we close he
[1:26:05] says right here in the Rapture message
[1:26:07] he says in the seven in the seven Angel
[1:26:11] message why he was making his
[1:26:15] Proclamation his
[1:26:17] ministry and when he begin to sound
[1:26:20] forth his ministry
[1:26:23] not when he started out now he take a
[1:26:27] type here Jesus when he started
[1:26:30] out he started Healing The Sick and they
[1:26:36] Afflicted and all great robber he he's
[1:26:40] he's a prophet and everybody wanted him
[1:26:43] in his church but when he sat down one
[1:26:47] thing and said I and my father are
[1:26:51] one that was
[1:26:54] different that was
[1:26:56] different that was different except you
[1:27:00] eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[1:27:03] drink his blood you have no life in you
[1:27:07] why he's a vampire see that was
[1:27:11] different now brother brandham is giving
[1:27:13] us a type here Jesus in his ministry
[1:27:16] when he was healing the sake everybody
[1:27:18] wanted
[1:27:20] him you know
[1:27:23] uh uh they talk all their sick people to
[1:27:26] him they even had to break the roof of a
[1:27:28] house to let a sick man
[1:27:32] down but then when he sat down and
[1:27:35] started to teach them the word when he
[1:27:38] started to teach them the word brother
[1:27:40] bam said in in the message uh uh
[1:27:43] leadership he says that was where the
[1:27:46] ministry of Jesus
[1:27:48] changed when he started to teach the
[1:27:51] word
[1:27:54] he was no longer on a big healing
[1:28:01] campaign that was where brother Brandon
[1:28:03] Ministry changed when he started to
[1:28:05] teach the word the people said oh he was
[1:28:07] supposed to he was called a prophet to
[1:28:09] pray for the
[1:28:11] sake he's not a theologian he he never
[1:28:14] had anything to do with the
[1:28:16] word but he did not realize that was the
[1:28:19] changing of the
[1:28:21] ministry
[1:28:28] because asaiah has prophesied and said
[1:28:31] all of my children will be taught of me
[1:28:35] that's why God
[1:28:36] says he's interested in our teaching how
[1:28:40] we are
[1:28:44] taught praise the
[1:28:46] Lord he don't want us to raise ourself
[1:28:49] by the Shu understanding by the way
[1:28:52] people do things in church and we think
[1:28:54] that is the way it's supposed to be no
[1:28:57] he's interested in our teaching how are
[1:29:00] we
[1:29:07] taught are we
[1:29:10] together okay let's finish this and then

[1:29:33] them that he was the messenger of that
[1:29:36] age and he didn't have to explain
[1:29:39] nothing those disciples might not have
[1:29:42] been able to explain it but they believe
[1:29:44] it whether they could explain it or
[1:29:47] not they said rise still and believe it
[1:29:51] how could would they tell if they were
[1:29:54] going to eat his flesh or drink his
[1:29:57] blood why it was impossible for them to
[1:30:00] do do it but they believe it because
[1:30:03] they were ordained Jesus said he choose
[1:30:06] them before the foundation of the
[1:30:11] word praise the
[1:30:14] Lord so you see when

[1:30:41] able to identify the the uh uh uh uh the
[1:30:46] seven Angel message just like that lady
[1:30:49] that we we read about from the beginning
[1:30:53] she believed that this was a
[1:30:55] prophet and if she believed that he was
[1:30:57] a prophet she believed he was a prophet
[1:31:01] and that Prophet that she believed he
[1:31:03] was came to came to her and says this is
[1:31:06] the hand of the Lord if she believe he
[1:31:09] was a prophet she have to believe it
[1:31:12] also you see we only want to believe it
[1:31:15] when it's in our
[1:31:18] favor we only want to believe it when
[1:31:21] when we can understanding
[1:31:28] all that was the thing that got me when
[1:31:30] I was thinking about that when I was
[1:31:33] listening to that tape the thing that
[1:31:35] got me I'm saying to myself that what a
[1:31:41] faith what a
[1:31:44] faith she would tell the doctors just
[1:31:47] leave my baby can you just please leave
[1:31:48] my baby there let me let me call brother
[1:31:50] Brandon
[1:31:52] and they will leave the baby there a
[1:31:54] dead baby for a couple of
[1:31:56] days and he will be praying waiting on
[1:31:59] the Lord and He will come back and says
[1:32:02] it's the hand of the Lord and we will
[1:32:04] stay gather ourself together and accept
[1:32:07] it this is what God want and we say amen
[1:32:12] and then we move
[1:32:14] on praise the Lord
[1:32:19] amen they want to believe in if if if if
[1:32:22] it is just in their
[1:32:29] favor we want to believe it when it's in
[1:32:32] our favor we want to believe it when uh
[1:32:34] you know we can be able to
[1:32:43] no this almighty God that we serve his
[1:32:45] ways are pass funny
[1:32:50] out
[1:32:54] the thing that Rejoice our heart is
[1:32:56] because we have heard our
[1:32:58] names amen it's not a joining of a
[1:33:01] church we have heard our
[1:33:05] names and when we listen to that Prophet
[1:33:08] voice when we listen to the word of God
[1:33:10] being
[1:33:11] preached we are not just carried about
[1:33:14] Carried Away about all the excitement
[1:33:16] and all the manifestation praise the
[1:33:18] Lord for that amen we thank God for
[1:33:21] those things
[1:33:23] but what we want to hear is what what
[1:33:25] that Prophet messenger is
[1:33:29] saying because it is that word that
[1:33:32] gives you power in the age that you are
[1:33:34] living to realize that the spirit that
[1:33:38] we are risling in this age I mean the
[1:33:41] the the the internet Spirit the
[1:33:43] technology and all the demon power
[1:33:45] brother bar say every age had inherited
[1:33:48] from it uh uh succeeding age the spirit
[1:33:52] of the age just to realize that it is
[1:33:54] the word nothing but the word that gives
[1:33:57] you
[1:34:06] power more than a manifestation we want
[1:34:10] the
[1:34:11] word praise the
[1:34:14] Lord
[1:34:16] amen more than the healing of our body
[1:34:19] do you do you realize that in this age
[1:34:21] people would will rather the healing of
[1:34:24] their body and the condemning of their
[1:34:28] soul let me say something to you tonight
[1:34:31] before I close that prophecy over in
[1:34:34] Isaiah chapter 53 by his tries that we
[1:34:37] were healed is more than the healing of
[1:34:39] our
[1:34:42] body that prophecy is tied to the
[1:34:46] Redemption it's more than the healing of
[1:34:49] our body it's not only limited to the
[1:34:51] healing of our body that's the reason
[1:34:54] why whether in sickness or in health our
[1:34:57] soul can still rejoice in the
[1:35:02] Lord praise the
[1:35:05] Lord how many people will back on the
[1:35:08] word of God and then they will fall away
[1:35:10] from falling serving God because the
[1:35:13] Bible said by his tribe I'm he and I'm
[1:35:15] not heal it's only limited to your body
[1:35:18] for
[1:35:18] you but for the Son of God or for the
[1:35:21] daughter of God is more than the healing
[1:35:24] of our
[1:35:25] body amen because no matter how many
[1:35:28] times that God heal us as long as we are
[1:35:31] in this life we will still have a
[1:35:33] headache we will still have a stomach
[1:35:35] ache we will still have a back ache
[1:35:37] because we are in a falling
[1:35:43] body but when he heal our soul by
[1:35:46] redeeming us back to the word and giving
[1:35:49] you the Holy Ghost amen amen it's onto
[1:35:53] the day of
[1:35:56] redemption hallelujah praise the
