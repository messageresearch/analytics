tonight amen the Lord bless you thank you thank you thank you musicians let's take our Bible tonight and and we will just go to the sons of Solomon sons of Solomon Chapter 2 I want to I want to speak on the prophecy tonight never seen that as a prophet said until uh uh few days ago I was listening to a tape I was actually listening to the message the Rapture and brother Bram says something and then uh uh uh the Lord the Holy Spirit kind of brought something to my mind so I stopped the tap and then I started looking at some few things and I realized there was a prophecy that was laying down right in this chapter we want to read tonight so let's just uh take Psalms of Solomon Chapter 2 and we read from verse 8 like I said I'm trying to lay a foundation for what I want to speak on Sunday and going on Amen because you know when I start like this is hard to get get out of Faith but let's uh read from verse two the voice of my beloved praise the Lord the voice of my beloved and what I want us to realize in this in this writing that Solomon wrote The Beloved is Christ amen the Beloved is Christ so we we have to keep that now so the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountain skipping upon the hill my beloved is like a road all a young heart behold he standed behind our wall he lookth forth at the uh at the window showing himself through the lashes my beloved speak and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away praise the Lord this looks like like h h a kind of beautiful sen year of the bride and the bridegroom my belov speak and said unto me rise up my love my fed one come away for L the winter is passed no winter is here for us amen it have not passed yet praise the Lord the rain is over and gone the flower appeared on Earth it looks like springtime the time the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtles is heard in our will learn the fake tree pth forth her green fate and the vines have their tender grapes gave a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one come away oh my do thou are in the Cliff of the Rock in the secret place of the stirs now look here that you have to remember uh uh the secret place here brother brandham in Psalm chapter 27 brother brandham read that same thing about the secret place hiding in the secret place and that was what he also used as a type of the Rapture so you see the bridegroom is calling the bride away in springtime and we know Springtime speak speak about Resurrection praise the Lord so there there there is a lot of thing that is playing out here more than what we can see we have to remember that every the prophet of God says when you read the Bible if you don't see Christ go back and read it again amen and what we have to realize is that uh uh uh every word of every word that is written in this Bible is a prophecy praise the Lord the Holy Spirit just have to pick it up open our eyes and make us to realize that it's a prophecy because it's God's Own word amen so I read that again verse 14 oh my Dove thou in the Cliff of the rock which is hiding in Revelation in the secret place of the stirs let me see th countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is th voice and their countenance is coming but this is where we want to dwell take us the foxes take us the foxes for the most time that this scripture has been read they have always sound like take up the foxes for the little foxes spoil the vine but we want to look at it a little different or a little close or maybe a a little deeper tonight take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vine for our Vine have tender Grace St John chapter 15 St John chapter 15 praise the Lord St John chapter 15 St John chapter 15 verse one I am the True Vine and my H and my father is the husband man let's pray father we just want to give your word to you tonight come Lord father and just bless these few thoughts that is on our pass tonight as we want to look closely into the word let something be said that will draw us closer to you let something be said Lord that will open our eyes to the time that we are living in and the things that are happening around us in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat like I said I was I was listening to to the message the Rapture and actually this is the statement that brother Brandon made and and it caught my mind in the Rapture message the prophet of God said the Lord himself had a sense of human you know he said Herold go tell thy Fox see today I cast out devil tomorrow I'm made perfect so he had a sense of him well it won't hurt us I don't think so once in a while praise the Lord so he said that you know he said when Jesus said referring to pharaoh go tell that fox brother bam said Jesus was was making fun or just making a little joke but then there is another place also where he said it and and he said it in a different way we're going to look at that tonight so it caught my mind that Jesus re referred to Pharaoh I mean Herod sorry Herod as a fox and here is on inspiration Solomon is now speaking about the bridegroom and the bride and he's talking about how the foxes pour the vine praise the Lord amen and Jesus came and he says I am the True Vine amen if he identified Herod to be a fox and he identified himself to be a Vine then we have to pay attention there is something more than just a joke praise the Lord there is something more than just a sense of humor that I want for us to pay attention to tonight praise the Lord because the same foxes that SPO the vine that time is also sporing the vine now praise the lord we have lot of foxes that have come into the vanard and they are destroying the vine they are destroying the vine before a put out is T of grapes and that's what I want for us to pay attention to tonight I want for us to look closely into the scripture because you will realize just before our lord Jesus will be born it was Herold that was a governor and he will be the one that will ask that every child from two years old should be killed because he heard a wise man saying where is he born King of the Jews so right from that time the foxes was destroying the vine and so I want us to pay attention because this Bible this word of God that we we hold before us tonight is interal praise the Lord amen we can preach from Genesis to Revelation and we will not come close to understanding The Depths that is in this word praise the Lord let me tell you one thing that is true all eternity this is what we will be understanding all inity there is more in you that we will understand in eternity praise the Lord amen but let's look at this very closely because I want to bring it down to something that is that is uh you know that is happening in our time and and happening in our range that we call the message of the hour so brother Bram said there he says you know what Jesus have a sense of human he called the uh uh Herold go tell th Fox but we want to look at a more than a sense of humor praise the Lord because you have to remember when Jesus was identified on the River Jordan and two of John disciples follow him I believe there were many many many other animals but Jesus said the foxes have hes the birds have Nets but the son of man don't have a place to lay his head why he Call Foxes why he never talk about the Lions why he never talk about the goats that were on the mountain I want us to pay attention tonight praise the Lord amen listen to what brother Brandon will say as we as we build this t talk tonight and go ahead in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says now in he says in the days of the scripture he didn't take upon himself any great name talking about our lord Jesus he was a man that was humble but yet a man that could tell you if it was necessary you know what he told Herod you know what he told the Pharisees he ploted those ropes together he beat them out of the temple and called them hypocrite snake in the grass and everything else and call Herod and old Fox but yet for of humanity humble man and he went about doing good to everybody that he could now so brother brandham is also bringing another picture after he he make us to see like you know Jesus was just saying a little sense of heing but now he's bringing it in another way that Jesus did not bite his tongue when he spoke amen he didn't bite his tongue he said things the way it was he called the Pharisees you know that you were just a white wash on the home he's a snake in the grass you know he called them and yeah he referring to this very same statement he said he called Herold which was the governor a fox praise the Lord amen now for you to be able to get the picture of what we want to go in tonight you see it's just like when you read back in the Old Testament and you hear about pharaoh phoh Pharaoh is not uh a name Pharaoh is a title amen so also Hera is a title because if you don't pay attention you will you will miss things that are in the scripture you you could read about many Heros and you think that is just one Herold and that's what I want for us to pay attention tonight because Herod the Great that was the governor of Juda at the time that Jesus was born was not the same Herod that requested John the Baptist head he was not the same hero that killed James in the book of arch praise the Lord are we together but if uh if if if if if Herod that that uh uh that requested for all the children from two years old to be killed at a time if he's not the same one that requested the head of John the Baptist if he will be different and the one that will that will that will kill James in Acts chapter 12 will be different and Jesus will call this Herald a fox then there is something about the fox that spoil the vine there is something that Jesus was identifying that I want us to pay attention to praise the Lord no doubt brother Brandon in in in in some other messages he used the foxes that SP the vine as our little misbehavior you know he says our our besetting sins you know get rid of those besetting sin those little little things you know it's not the big things it's the little things as he said that he identified them all also as foxes but I'm I'm I'm looking more into prophecy tonight amen I'm looking more into prophecy tonight then uh uh uh so that's what I want for us to look at a little bit let's let's go into into a little history here you realize realiz that uh uh uh Herod the Great historian identified that uh he was around 37 uh to to to 4 BC and and they said it was just in that time that Jesus was born so when you read in the scripture and it talks about the the the heral that that the wise men met praise the Lord he will be that very same Herald he will be the one that uh the wise men will meet and and then he will be the one also to uh uh uh tell them when you find the child you know come and tell me and I would like to go and worship the child and and that's that's all the Christmas story amen the birth of Jesus and the wise man would not tell him the Bible says that uh the Lord will lead them another way to go away and and then present their gifts and and they got away but yet when he realized that he never saw the wise man he commanded that you know children from two years old uh should be killed praise the Lord then if you look closely also uh the Bible will speak of uh uh this will be in uh in uh uh uh Matthew Chapter 2 the Bible will speak of why uh uh Mary and Joseph could not stay in Beed him because there was uh arula wish of call he was the son of the of the Herold the great Herold that wanted the children to be killed so because of him because of his son Mary and Joseph will leave Bethlehem and it will go down to Nazareth praise the Lord then the Bible will speak about uh Herold Antipas he's the one that will kill John the Baptist but before we we get into death I want us to pay attention also you read St John Chapter 2 Jesus said destroy this Temple and he three days I will raise it up the Bible says the Jews thought that it was the temple that Herod build praise the Lord so the temple that the sedran council was using that Temple was built by Herod the Great now if you want to trace this whole thing back and get a good picture of it you will realize that hero you see Rome Rome was ruling the word at that time they were ruling the word and and in in different parts in different regions they put men up to be Governor now Herod was put over Jerusalem to be a governor because the Romans thought that he was a Jew praise the Lord because what the Romans would do is that they would choose a man of this tribe to to govern his people and that man will send report over to uh uh uh you know the the the whoever the Roman Governor that was ruling at the time you know well so that's the reason why when you see see at the death of Jesus he was sent to Herod and Herod sent him back to Pilot pilot was the Roman Governor Herod was the Jewish Governor working for Rome are we together are you seeing the picture praise the Lord amen now so but what is happening here is that Herod was not Jew he was not a Jew herrow historian shows that herrow was from Edom he was an Edomite and Edom will go back to Esau are we together amen and there was a conflict right from the womb between Esau and Jacob and that conflict will take us in the Rapture praise the Lord that conflict that that conflict will put a pressure on this bride because remember they were twins in the womb praise the Lord so when Jesus called Herod the fox he knew what he was saying because he was The Lord Of Glory when Solomon said is the foxes that spoil the vine he might he might not have known what he was saying but it was a prophecy praise the Lord because right from the birth of Christ the fox was already there to start eating of the vine trying to get the vine he killed children from two years old on praise the Lord when John the Baptist raised up with with his ministry to identify the Messiah make a people ready it was the fox that went after the vine praise the Lord oh people How We Do together amen let's read Acts chapter 12 I'm trying to get ahead of myself I'm holding all my breaks because this is just a Wednesday night amen but I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm hoping that the Holy Spirit can be able to bring something out of this tonight that will that that that that make you to go home and hold hold tight to your pillow and say thank you Jesus praise the Lord acts chap 12 the Bible says now about the time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to Vex setting off the church and he killed James the brother of John with a SW now he was coming afterward he was vexing what he was vexing the church the Bible says he was vexing the church he was putting pressure on the church are we together but you see because the the Roman Governor government wanted peace they wanted you know no faces they just want the people to be governed you know they were ruling at that time and I mean there there is just a whole whole lot of history there we not be we can't be able to take all the time there now so uh today whether this man was an Edomite and and these other people they were they were they were uh from Judea they are all the same so there so they just pick pick him and and make him a governor to him he to them he's a Jewish man praise the Lord but you will see you will you will realize that uh uh uh uh you go you you go through the scripture there there was there was always there was always a kind of a conflict and even and even Jesus the Bible says when he was when he was sent sent to to Herod and and you know and Herod was asking him all all sorts of question he never answer him a word he never said a word to him praise the Lord amen and there's a reason why he never said a word to him because think about it now this is the Lord Of Glory this is the very one that t Rebecca there is two nation in your womb praise the Lord and they are going to be at local head they are going to they they they are going to struggle they are going to fight I mean right from the war praise the Lord the foxes that SPO the vine the foxes that SPO the vine see this man came and he he built a temple he tried to to to to to build something that will look like the the Temple of Solomon praise the Lord and even the Jews call it the Temple of Herod they call it Herod Temple and that's the place they were going praise the Lord amen he don't have no connection to the Covenant he don't have no connection to the promise of Abraham but yet he build the people a temple they are happy to have a temple praise the Lord amen glory be to God yeah I mean that's the same thing that Catholics Catholics does you never see them evangelizing they just build a building and they're going to get SCE praise the Lord they don't have to preach about doctorine whether you baptized wrong whether you didn't baptize wrong and they just move to a place to just build a building praise the Lord amen you find men that don't have they don't have no burden for Source all want to do they just want to build a church they just want to build a church and and and uh and they're going to put right upon it the spoken word The Living Word Tabernacle you have to realize that the vine is the word all through the scripture God referred to Israel as a Vine the vine goes back to the tree of life that was in the Garden of Eden that tree of life was the vine it was the vine to give life to the people and what the foxes is after is to cut that life short is to cut the life if they can bite the vine they can destroy the life of the vine and we can just have form we can come we say we believe the message and there is nothing like the life of Jesus Christ nothing like the life that the prophet of God gave us praise the Lord you have a different Christmas message this year I just pray that the Lord will bless it and you'll see the direction that we are going in because that's that's the direction that we are going in amen that's the direction that we are going in lot of foxes have creeped right into this message praise the Lord creep right into the message identifying thems to be bride to be message Believers and killing the very life and repetition of the message so we realize that this is this is more than just a man this is a spirit this is a spirit how did they organize it you see the the spirit was watching every time he sees the word trying to come forth here is a prophet that was on the land a voice of one crying in the wilderness praise the Lord if if you go back and read history it will tell you that the Jews were not happy with Herod the antii because when he took his brother's wife he was breaking the Lord in Leviticus so they were not happy with him but why he went only after John the Baptist why he went only after John the Baptist because he had the message of the vine those other bunch of Jews they were all caught up in Traditions praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight praise the Lord hallelujah now so when you was this I mean it's so it's so kind of a beautiful year it's uh I mean when you watch it and you you are able to to grab the picture so there was Herod the Great and there was Herod antias there was Herold Phillip so if you look there uh uh Antipas Herold Antipas took Phillip's wife because they were they were govering two different part one was in the sou part of Judah and one was in I think uh the western part of the northern part of Judah and uh uh uh then you go you read also over in the book of uh acts you see the Bible talks about uh agrea the one that Paul met he was also a Herod Herod the agrea and that's that's the second that Paul met that was Herod graa the first he actually was the one that killed James uh uh and and was determined to kill Peter before uh the angel of the law came down and delivered Peter out of the prison praise the Lord is uh it's it's very beautiful I don't want to go ahead of myself but uh I mean uh I'm just trying to hold this together for the Wednesday night and then uh uh by the help of the lord we will be able to look more into into it praise the Lord amen now so uh uh as we as we look as we look at this subject we see here that uh just like how the Roman govern and uh all they wanted is just to have the people under their control and just have peace in the land they never wanted to have no uproar there was no rioting no fighting nothing they just wanted to have peace in the land so I mean mean to put a governor over the people to govern the people and and it it's always like that you go back and read the book of uh of Danel or you read the book of Jeremiah you will see how uh the the king of Babylon set a a man of the people to rule the land and then gave you know report back to to the king of Babylon I mean that's that's how it is all over they just put a person there so it is the same thing here you know they put this uh uh uh uh uh uh Herod the Great to Rude and uh because this they think okay this is this is this is his people I mean if if this man can be able to raise a temple for this people I mean he he mimic he buil something so close to the Temple of Solomon you know that uh the the Jews were so pleased you know they told Jesus they said this Temple was in building for 40 plus years and you say you build it break it down and build it in in 3 days you don't know what you're talking about praise the Lord and you see and because he did that in some way he kind of forarm the heart of the Jews because he gave them a place of worship praise the Lord what is the need of giving a place of worship and you will now worship the god that the people are worshiping it was not enough praise the Lord but thou was a way because uh the the the the Jewish people were a religious people that was the way to be able to quiet a religious people just tell them the prophecy whether you slide one thing in or another the moment they hear the prophecy they're not going to questioning they're not even going back home to search whether it's truth or not just gave them something that will appease their religion praise the Lord give them something that will appease their religion quote quote the message of the hour that's that's all they need all the doctrines and Division and abuses and things that we have experienced around the message came from courts people were using courts to destroy churches and Destroy people life they were not cting from the Quran they were using C they were saying brother bandam sh they would call the year they would call the paragraph glory be to God praise the Lord but you know one time in the time of the judges praise the Lord God raised up a George called Samson and one time Samson was trying to to to get to get to this Philistine he was he was looking for the way something he could do to really get the attention of these Philistines you know what he did he grabbed foxes the Bible says he grab I didn't know how he do it but I just believe it was by inspiration he grabbed them and he Ted them he tied their tail two at a time and he put fire on their tail praise the Lord I believe that the Holy Ghost is about to pour fire on some foxes that are highing in this message because God is raising up a bride that is not just going to take your word because you say brother brand I'm saved they're going to look in the scripture God is raising up a church that is going to require you to live what you preach don't come and tell brother Bram says you live What You Preach praise the Lord I'm telling you this message has raised up preachers like no other denomination has because every denomination has its qualification we we don't have anything a man go and pick up a semon book and and and you know and and he can quote brother Brandon he he start quoting and he start preaching this is what our lord said it's the foxes that has spoed this Vine this thing that was supposed to bring Deliverance it was supposed to be brother Bram says H H what's the message that he preached God reaching Mercy he said this message supposed to be an atonement because God raised up a Healing Ministry Divine Healing with a gift that could go back into the people life and and and and and and and and resolve their problem not only for healing but to to be able to tell them why they are dealing with this and why they are dealing with that and we can handle many things today just because of a gift that God brought to the Earth it was supposed to be an atonement but he said every time that God will raise up a gift the people will idolize it instead of it being a blessing to the people it becomes an idol praise the Lord but God is raising up a bride She's Not Just satisfied with our baptized in Jesus name She's Not Just satisfied with I believe the message she want this word to be made flesh in her praise the Lord she's not going to stop for nothing until she can see Christ on two feet amen praise the Lord that's why taking her in Rapture it's not just a church membership it's not a bash that we wear it it's not a dress Cod it's a life be to God Solomon was writing his love note but he didn't know that he was prophesying he was prophesying some of the deepest prophecy of History praise the Lord he was prophesying identifying the two spirit that work in the church praise the Lord Brother Abraham says the True Vine and the false Vine Solomon says the vine and the foxes praise the Lord amen it says the True Vine and the false Vine is the two spirit that work in the church but back hundreds hundreds of years ago Solomon say is going to be the vine and the foxes that will spoil the vine the foxes that have come to eat the life up praise the Lord they come to eat the life up they creep in they sit under the atmosphere of the word they learned the language of the message they learn all the cliche of the message the things you can say and you will Ginger the people glory be to God just have few minutes there and I should close tonight but I'm not in hurried we'll get down to this amen we get down to this going to look at it in different ways praise the Lord we're going to look at it in many different ways and pray that uh the Lord will be able to help us amen the Lord will be able to help us but you just think about it go home read do your own search and think about it why it had to be yes yes a Roman govern a government here that picks a man an Edomite from an easer tribe and set him over a promised people the man that refused the blessing the man that despised the birthright his sea line was set over these people and to please the people he build them a temple he I mean he governed them yeah he adiz to them praise the Lord but just like what what did what did Solomon say the tender great the tender is Young when is just coming up just when the vine was just a little baby that fox brought out his his his nature from two years AG down killed him why why did he Tau that it was a spirit that has been hunting to destroy the word right from the beginning that same spirit that that haunted to destroy the word in Eden and all all he had to do just bring Eve to a reasoning and he rob her of the power of the word she could no longer live out the word because she's reasoning she's doubting all down through ages be haunting the life praise the Lord the Bible even says when when when Jesus started preaching Herod was afraid he thought John the Baptist has raised from the dead he thought John has raised from the dead when he heard that Jesus was preaching after he have killed John I thought I stop this thing I thought I killed this plant praise the lord well you see that same fox has come in many different ways especially in our day and age praise the Lord the foxes don't want your clothes they want your Lifeline they just want to get on that Lifeline make the word of God of no effect you can you can join a church you you can you know uh identify with a message as long as he can be able to suck your Lifeline that's what he wants you can claim to believe the message you can count how many years you've been in the message you can count all the the the different pastors you know the fox does not it does not care all he wants he want to destroy that life are we together listen to what brother Brandon will say I try to find a place to close here he says here the angel of the Lord now God God is in his people always being a miracle working God all ages when they had Revival breaking out they had healing Martin Luther John Wesley sing Moy and uh other you could CAU I stood near the sh not long ago that build uh uh that's built of him there there in England talking about John Wesley were that he was preaching Divine Healing and they turned a fox loose praise the Lord he said John was preaching Divine Healing and the turn of fox LS and a bunch of fox ha and and and and Scattered his audience John Wesley turned around and pointed his finger in the man's face and said the sun will now set on your head three times till you be asking me to pray for you and as the sun went down that the evening the man ding with cramp in his stomach and Wesley never got to him and when Wesley was in America now you see brother yeah he he he just talking about how Divine Healing the power of God has followed every Revival amen just like we said on some something I mean that that is the Redeemer business he want to be in his Redemption praise the lord we must now worship a god that is not in our midst he want to be in our midst he want to be part of our worship praise the Lord amen God don't want you on your knees and he's behind the clouds lord when you get down on your knees he want to come close he want to be there to commune with you that's the kind of a God we Ser now the one that is behind the clouds we got to be knocking the wall and knocking the benches and you know kicking everything for him to come we got to make lot of noise for him to come he want to be right there when the right atmosphere is created when the word is having the preeminence then God comes down in the midst of his people and make himself real praise the Lord is the foxes that spoil the vine is the foxes that's SP the vine and they are a lot of foxes that have affected this Vine praise the Lord this last day move of God Amen like Jude would say men that have creep in on the way that's what the fox does glory be to God Amen talking about God among his people God saying in every Revival every move of God God was among his people praise the Lord hallelujah amen now something I was looking at let's go back a little bit and uh uh when you look in the you look in the uh concordance I was looking at this word when you when you uh uh you read over there in in in Songs of Solomon where it says uh take up the foxes the concordance always says this I mean it it says it was amazing it says to perceive to perceive to be able to look it says uh the ability to see beyond what is seen in the physical presence as a light piercing through Darkness so when when the When when when when uh uh uh uh Solomon said take take us the foxes is speaking more than things that we can see with our natural eyes praise the Lord amen it didn't say take up the foxes it said take us the foxes it's a kind of a language is it's a it's a prophetic language that make us to look Beyond far beyond what we are seeing with our natural eyes praise the Lord because if it's the foxes that spoil the vine and if it's a spiritual thing that is going on we're not going to see it with our natural eyes unless the Holy Ghost rever it unless God expose it we're not going to see it praise the Lord and that is the same thing that is happening I mean people said right honor the reveal word they s under the word the message of the they hear the voice of God praise the Lord and He the hold to things in their heart and the hold to attitude how we relating to this world what we take the message to be is the person of Jesus Christ it's the person of Jesus Christ praise the Lord but you see it it is it's it's just like if he was here in person see he went over to Simon house what did they do they just set him in a corner with some dirad feet nobody was paying attention to him and that is the very same thing that we are doing we get the word on tape we get it on our phone we get it on our laptop we get it on everything but it's just there nobody paying attention to this living Christ that is in our midst this is not a cult it's not a society that we have drawn it's not a movement this is the Living God among his people a word that has come to change our life praise the Lord it has come to change our life the prophet of God said it has come to make us better neighbors to our neighbors it has come to make us better parents to our children better wives to our husband better husband to our wife that's why we must be looking for how is the word making me better that's why we must be looking for how is this word making me better the ability to see beyond what is seen with the physical presence as a light piercing in darkness as a light piercing in darkness as a light piercing in darkness to be able to perceive because it's a spirit it's not an individual it's a spirit that comes on people it's a spirit that is Waring against this word that don't want you and myself to bring this word in flesh praise the Lord it does not want you and myself to bring this word in flesh you love the Lord tonight I will share something with you and then I will close and I will start from from there on Sunday by God's grace you love the Lord tonight oh praise the Lord see what brother Brandon said it's it's not up there it's not part of my notes it's what I have for you on Sunday he said when Christ Jesus was being formed in Mary that's when the persecution set in when the word was formed in Mary that was when the foxes was ready to destroy the child ready to destroy the word and the prophet God says because the word is being formed in you the foxes are also loose to destroy the vine God bless you the musicians can come we'll pick it up on Sunday w why should I worry and why should I fear this very same Jesus he

been thinking about it for a couple of weeks now as I studed but what I what I'm praying that the Lord will help us just like I said brother Brandon share with you look at the foxes that spoil the vine he says something here where he he attributed there to our life he says here he says that every little J everything you must be faithful in is all always the little Vine the little foxes that spoil the vine something you leave it's not the big things you do it's the little things you leave undone remember a chain is only is strongest at his weaker length blessed are they that do all the Commandments of God that they might have the right to enter in so he bringing it down to our life we coming to the end of another year we don't know what the coming year is bringing for us but I'm telling you people there's never a time where the message of the hour has come under lot of struening it's even under government struening now and this word has to be real to us it has to be real it's a Living Word it's not an intellectual it's not a it's not a grar and H H it's a word that that is living among us it's changing life it's healing B is bounding [Music] families and they can do the same for you and myself the word is not given to us for us to do anything that we want to do or anything that we like to [Music] do how is this word changing you how is it affecting your life how is he drawing you [Music] closer why is he saying to you it's not just about preaching the sermon it's identifying the Living God in our midst if we are not Experiencing God we are wasting our time because he's not a God that we can learn he's a God that want to be experienced he's a God that want to make himself [Music] known and we have all of these foxes that are that are destroying the vine destroying our young people there are a lot of things on the internet negative about the message and young people are feeding their minds they don't they don't have what it takes to be able to they don't they have not built the thinkings man F and they go into those things and they listen to those things it's affecting their mind and and and talking about all sorts of negative things and all the unclean things all of these uh foxes are there to destroy the [Music] [Music] vine this word has to be real to us this word is here to Rapture you this word has been sent to change your body it must

and more Lord the enemy is going to pressure us he want to squeeze that life want to squeeze the life of the vine the devil does not care if we get a membership he does not care it if you count how many years you've been around the message if he can squeeze that life if he can brings the word into question if he can create something that make you to start questioning the message and questioning the messenger and question questioning your pastor and questioning h h i mean even your own self he just want to get to that place to kill the effect of the word you have to remember Mary never came under the persecution until the words started forming in her and if the word is forming in you if that word is dealing with your heart you're going to feed the pressure dear father we pray tonight
