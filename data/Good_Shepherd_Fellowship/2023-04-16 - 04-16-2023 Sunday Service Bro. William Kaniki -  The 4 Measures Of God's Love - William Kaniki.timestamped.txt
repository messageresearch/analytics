[45:05] amen so uh
[45:09] I pray I need you from Brother John Bibi
[45:11] he's away this morning so he asks that
[45:14] we remember him in prayer and uh we just
[45:17] we just want to thank the Lord
[45:19] uh
[45:21] Sister Mary are you feeling much better
[45:23] well I praise the Lord
[45:25] give me this morning with a pain on her
[45:28] heart and so uh
[45:31] we just pray for her back there
[45:33] believing that the Lord is going to
[45:35] bless us in his presence this morning
[45:36] amen amen the Lord has been so good to
[45:40] us you know uh
[45:43] as you look into the word of the Lord
[45:45] before we call the preacher this morning
[45:48] uh I would just I just want us to just
[45:51] uh uh kind of a a place I will mine on
[45:56] the Lord and think about his goodness
[45:59] think about the goodness of the Lord
[46:02] if you look at this scripture in the
[46:05] Bible
[46:06] there will be in Deuteronomy chapter 23
[46:12] in the autonomy chapter 23
[46:17] we will read verse 2.
[46:43] [Music]
[46:45] praise the Lord
[46:47] and uh
[46:50] uh
[47:26] foreign
[47:42] he's so good
[47:44] in the way that he deal with us
[47:47] I've been looking at a few of this
[47:50] and just to see
[47:54] that God in the richness of his Mercy
[47:59] uh
[48:05] you know
[48:06] Moses said these things and like I was
[48:09] saying on Wednesday night you read it in
[48:12] a scripture
[48:14] and then you look at it as a law of God
[48:20] you look at it as a lord of God
[48:23] and then
[48:25] it looks more like
[48:27] because of our
[48:29] our natural birth where the Lord has
[48:33] redeemed us from which of course brother
[48:35] Branham said is is uh we always stay
[48:38] with us as a sticky nature
[48:41] when the when the truthness of gods were
[48:44] come sometimes we we relate to that
[48:47] stick in nature and it looks like uh
[48:51] the word is condemning us or the word is
[48:56] trying to to remind us of our past and
[48:59] and all of that
[49:01] but the mind of God God's picture that
[49:05] he have in his mind
[49:07] is uh is far past whatever that we are
[49:11] going through and whatever that we are
[49:13] dealing with God's desire is to be able
[49:16] to bring us
[49:18] to the picture that he had about you in
[49:21] his mind
[49:22] praise the Lord the prophet of God said
[49:25] he took a picture of you and that's and
[49:27] that's the image that he have kept
[49:29] before him all of this wine
[49:32] praise the Lord but you see he speaks a
[49:36] language to us
[49:38] uh uh and then sometimes it looks like
[49:42] uh
[49:43] [Music]
[49:46] you know he's
[49:48] he's uh he's calling us you know Jesus
[49:52] over here in the book of Deuteronomy
[49:55] in in the Book of Luke Jesus referred to
[49:58] something that Moses said in the book of
[50:00] Deuteronomy and uh when you look at that
[50:05] uh just like I said let's let's just
[50:07] read this portion
[50:09] uh
[50:32] I brought you to uh
[50:37] verse 2 the Bible says
[50:45] Ambassador Shana enter into the
[50:47] congregation of the Lord
[50:49] even to the 10th Generation
[50:54] shall he not enter into the congregation
[50:57] of the Lord
[51:00] in verse 3 we talk about
[51:02] the ammonites and the moabites which
[51:05] will refer to
[51:08] the two sons the Lord's heart with his
[51:11] daughters
[51:13] in as much as this looks it is the word
[51:15] of God and and God in this word here is
[51:20] uh uh you know laying things down for
[51:23] his people
[51:25] but if you if we look in the mind of God
[51:27] a little bit you will realize they are
[51:30] the uh
[51:34] we appreciate God for his grace we
[51:37] appreciate God for his Mercy because if
[51:39] you go to Matthew chapter 2
[51:43] and then you start to read in the
[51:45] genealogy of Jesus Christ
[51:49] you will realize the other
[51:53] this scripture that looks like a
[51:56] commandment of God and God is saying
[51:58] that
[52:00] these people they don't have a truth
[52:03] identification of their father
[52:05] you realize they are the
[52:09] on the other side of the picture is a
[52:12] prophecy
[52:15] praise the Lord
[52:17] on the other side of the picture is a
[52:19] prophecy because if you read Matthew
[52:22] chapter 2
[52:26] and Matthew starts to give an account of
[52:28] the genology of Jesus Christ
[52:32] he comes down the list of people from
[52:34] Abraham
[52:35] and he comes right into that story of
[52:39] Jacob and Judah comes out
[52:42] and in his third of Judah he brings the
[52:45] story of tema
[52:47] and he will talk about
[52:50] fearash the son that Judah had with his
[52:53] daughter-in-law
[52:56] but go back read your Bible you will
[52:58] realize that if you count from tema
[53:03] down to David
[53:06] is a tenth generation
[53:11] you read the greatest Redemption Story
[53:14] the greatest Redemption story in the
[53:18] Bible the way God play out his
[53:21] Redemption story
[53:23] of how he will bring the Lord through
[53:26] the Jews and then he will re he will he
[53:30] will bring the Gentile in by the Jews
[53:32] bringing their message to the Gentiles
[53:35] and through the Gentiles also he will
[53:37] restore back to the Jews the amaziah the
[53:41] greatest romance Redemption story that
[53:44] is in the Bible
[53:46] The Book of Ruth
[53:48] now we look at Ruth but many times we
[53:52] don't look at the background of boas the
[53:56] kingsman Redeemer
[53:58] do you realize that Boaz is the son of
[54:03] Rahab
[54:09] praise the Lord
[54:11] we look at Ruth as being a moabite
[54:17] now you think about it now naturally
[54:19] naturally think about it what what
[54:23] attraction the boys had to roof it's a
[54:28] sea lion
[54:30] there was a genetic
[54:32] something in him because they were all
[54:36] in the same sea lion
[54:39] the Bible says after Jericho 4 a prince
[54:45] of Judah married
[54:48] Rahab Simon
[54:50] and Rahab gave birth to boas
[54:57] praise the Lord
[54:58] [Music]
[55:01] savior he's going to be the case may
[55:04] Redeemer so if you look at the story
[55:06] God look at our natural birth
[55:11] because brother Branham said that
[55:13] natural birth was between the serpent
[55:15] and Eve
[55:17] every one of us our natural birth is a
[55:21] bastard birth
[55:24] is not of the word
[55:26] [Music]
[55:29] praise the Lord
[55:31] amen
[55:33] every one of us
[55:37] our natural birth
[55:40] that's the reason why
[55:43] we press true to break through our
[55:47] natural nature to be able to embrace the
[55:50] nature of God
[55:53] because just by our natural birth we
[55:56] will all go away from the word of God
[55:59] we were all straight
[56:01] we come to the word speaking lies
[56:05] is because it was a bastard birth
[56:08] between Eve and the second
[56:12] but you see God put this year as a
[56:15] commitment and also as a prophecy
[56:27] that there is an appointed time
[56:32] there is an appointed time
[56:37] 10th Generation
[56:39] what is the number 10.
[56:41] it's election
[56:45] you bring the tenth
[56:46] of all that you have to the Lord
[56:49] [Music]
[56:52] it speaks of election
[56:57] so you see he calling us to a higher
[57:01] and brother and myself was talking
[57:02] something yesterday and he was talking
[57:05] about the portion of the Gentiles around
[57:07] the Tabernacle
[57:10] the gentai portion was the outside of
[57:13] the Tabernacle
[57:16] and there was a holy place and you know
[57:18] and the Jews have to go in there you see
[57:20] when God taught about you and myself the
[57:22] way he taught to live with us was not
[57:25] from the outside
[57:29] praise the Lord
[57:30] God desired to be with us was from the
[57:33] inside
[57:35] he knew he had a predestinated seed
[57:38] that he placed in you
[57:42] and at an appointed time you will hear
[57:45] the word of God and you will start to
[57:47] respond to their predestinated seed but
[57:50] because it is this outside man that you
[57:53] know all of this wide you get confused
[57:56] when God is actually calling and dealing
[57:59] with you from the inside
[58:02] [Music]
[58:04] to the outside
[58:08] praise the Lord the Lord bless you
[58:11] let's stand to our faith we will sing a
[58:14] song here and then we will bring the

[1:45:12] I'll give you two examples
[1:45:17] because Jesus said
[1:45:20] let's read the scripture he says that
[1:45:23] day on Calvary that day on Calvary what
[1:45:26] is
[1:45:27] let's read that that day on coverage
[1:45:30] uh paragraph uh 45.
[1:45:44] foreign
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:47] He Walked on Earth
[1:46:58] the Earth was like a a uh
[1:47:03] volcano
[1:47:05] later
[1:47:06] before that the Earth be solid
[1:47:10] he was first fire
[1:47:13] he was a Volcan
[1:47:17] and sitting in the morning
[1:47:20] put his food
[1:47:26] and now when the the the the Earth
[1:47:29] became solid Hallelujah
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:30] God knew all knew about it
[1:48:36] foreign
[1:49:48] not create something that is void
[1:49:50] perfect God when you created
[1:49:53] everything that God does
[1:49:57] so Moses only saw the part that set and
[1:50:00] destroyed
[1:50:01] he says at the beginning
[1:50:03] thank you Lord foreign
[1:50:16] hello
[1:50:20] now now
[1:50:21] you know what I forgot to create is
[1:50:27] and it makes man
[1:50:31] now the Earth with a print of Satan will
[1:50:36] Formula he will form a man
[1:50:42] that you will hit God
[1:50:50] [Music]
[1:50:57] he did not know that he was a creature
[1:51:02] he was before the Creator
[1:51:06] God took a man and formed
[1:51:09] give him the form that we have
[1:51:12] now God took the men that was lying yeah
[1:51:18] inserted into a former man now said you
[1:51:22] see now this man
[1:51:23] has nothing with salvation
[1:51:56] now Jesus is speaking here
[1:52:02] that will die
[1:52:07] Jesus is not saying here that the body
[1:52:09] that was sinned
[1:52:11] he said
[1:52:13] because
[1:52:15] now the soul is the nature of God
[1:52:29] is unbelief
[1:52:35] the demo now the chief of the Demons
[1:52:40] he's speaking in demonology he did not
[1:52:43] Shuffle the too late
[1:52:49] he says his name is unbelief
[1:52:55] there's either
[1:52:57] unbelief
[1:52:59] or faith
[1:53:04] now in heaven there was one third with
[1:53:07] faith
[1:53:09] and yes
[1:53:11] two thirds was without faith that failed
[1:53:14] Allah see now at the end
[1:53:18] we will have one third we faith that
[1:53:21] year and two thirds without faith
[1:53:25] foreign
[1:53:49] came out of Eve
[1:53:52] yes
[1:53:54] God created meant for him to be God
[1:53:58] when a man down to the world
[1:54:01] the deity get away from him all leaves
[1:54:04] him in that song when the deity leaves
[1:54:08] him
[1:54:09] now his soul becomes darkened
[1:54:13] when the soul become dark let them up
[1:54:16] all the demons has the full rights to
[1:54:21] dwell the house
