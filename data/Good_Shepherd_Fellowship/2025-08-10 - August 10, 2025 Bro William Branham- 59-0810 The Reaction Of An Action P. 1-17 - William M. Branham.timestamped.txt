[1:03] and for
[1:05] preparation being made for another
[1:09] campaign.
[1:10] The memories of the last one still
[1:13] linger with me from down in Middletown.
[1:17] But tonight coming out here, I thought
[1:19] I'd never find the way. I just just kept
[1:23] moving
[1:25] and we are
[1:27] anticipating this week for a great
[1:31] spiritual outpouring of God's blessing
[1:36] upon us as we humbly are waiting
[1:42] his coming.
[1:45] And now we have six nights. This is
[1:49] Monday through Saturday and we were on a
[1:53] little rest period at this time the
[1:55] party and I and brother Sullivan
[1:59] uh had sent for me to come up and so we
[2:03] called him up and told him we'd like to
[2:06] come back up and meet some of these fine
[2:08] people again and God has given us this
[2:11] grand privilege.
[2:16] The boys are along, Leo and Jean.
[2:18] They're going to have the books and
[2:20] tapes and so forth, as that's their line
[2:24] of the business to to take care of the
[2:27] customers that wants the books and tapes
[2:30] and so forth. And then we thought we
[2:34] would have some healing services, our
[2:37] prayer for the sick, pray for them.
[2:41] And the Lord willing, we will begin our
[2:45] services of praying for the sick
[2:47] tomorrow night.
[2:51] Uh we usually have to give out some
[2:53] prayer cards to keep the people kind of
[2:55] lined up and in order.
[2:58] And then again, I I wanted to find out
[3:00] if that was kind of in the run of the
[3:03] people's mind.
[3:05] And I always like to come into the
[3:07] meeting and feel first just what the
[3:09] Holy Spirit would have us to say or do.
[3:14] And then we can make announcements. And
[3:16] as I come up on the platform just now
[3:18] with Leo and them, I just looked out and
[3:22] seen these little boy here and these
[3:25] ones in the wheelchair. And I looked
[3:27] around and that feeling come to me that
[3:30] God would have us to pray for the sick.
[3:33] And they uh tomorrow afternoon about
[3:37] what is your regular starting time?
[3:39] &gt;&gt; 7:30.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; 7:30. Well, say by 6:00 or 6:30. Se by
[3:43] 6:30. Anyhow, the boys will give out
[3:46] prayer cards for tomorrow night. We'll
[3:49] start praying for the sick and Lord
[3:51] willing, we'll have six nights or five
[3:54] nights of it. And then we'll be able to
[3:56] get through the entire group of people
[3:58] to pray for all who comes that wants to
[4:01] be prayed for. we'll pray for them. And
[4:04] so we just take our cards and come as we
[4:07] are called. And we are trusting that
[4:11] this will not only be just a, as we call
[4:14] it down in Kentucky, a protractive
[4:16] meeting, but a old-fashioned revival
[4:19] meeting right on these campgrounds here
[4:21] where I understand that many have
[4:23] cottages rented.
[4:25] And I think it would be good for prayer
[4:27] meetings to be going on all day long
[4:29] around here, just everywhere.
[4:32] For you cannot
[4:35] get anything from God until you get
[4:38] close to God.
[4:41] You know, it's written in the
[4:42] scriptures, "Draw nigh unto me and I'll
[4:45] draw nigh unto you."
[4:48] And if we are here now for one sole
[4:51] purpose,
[4:53] that is to draw nigh unto God,
[4:57] let's do that with all that's within us.
[5:00] draw nigh unto God.
[5:04] And I want to say this
[5:07] that God will never hear your prayer as
[5:11] long as you hide iniquity in your heart.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; He will not do it.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; God will. The Bible said over in I
[5:21] believe in first John 3, if our hearts
[5:25] condemn us not, then we have confidence
[5:27] in God. That is if we don't have no
[5:30] condemnation in our heart.
[5:34] I just went through an experience of
[5:35] that a few days ago
[5:38] and I might just stop here to tell you
[5:40] about it.
[5:43] For we never want to be in any hurry.
[5:47] That's what's one of the great ruins of
[5:49] our American heritage today is we're
[5:52] trying to run over the top of everybody.
[5:55] look like we're trying to run over top
[5:57] of God.
[5:59] Not waiting. They that wait upon the
[6:02] Lord shall renew their strength.
[6:06] I've been going through some testings at
[6:09] home and
[6:11] and I've been called in to witness some
[6:14] things in a
[6:16] for a trial and they'd call me over and
[6:20] over and over till I was just so tired.
[6:24] I I looked like the the whole world was
[6:26] a polus pulling on top of my head. I
[6:31] come home that morning and the wife
[6:33] said, "Well, how you doing?" I said,
[6:36] "Honey, them things would drive a person
[6:39] out of their mind."
[6:41] And so I just
[6:44] sat down to eat dinner and and the phone
[6:46] rang. We have an answering service and
[6:49] this is the private phone at the
[6:51] parsonage. So just then it rang and she
[6:53] went in, answered it. She put her hand
[6:55] over the phone. She said, "Billy, Sam
[6:58] attorneys again."
[7:00] Oh, I said, "Honey, I I couldn't stand
[7:02] it another afternoon." About six or
[7:04] seven days of it then. I said, "I just
[7:07] couldn't stand it." And I got up from
[7:10] the table and went out the door. I said,
[7:12] "Tell them I'm not in here now." Went
[7:14] around behind the house. I felt real
[7:17] bad. And I come back and my my wife is a
[7:22] whole lot better woman than I am a man.
[7:25] So when she come to the door looking at
[7:27] me, she said, "Was that just exactly
[7:30] right, Billy?"
[7:32] I said, "Sure, I know it wasn't
[7:34] already." But I wanted to make her think
[7:37] that my story would stick. So I said,
[7:39] "Yeah, I wasn't in here just then." She
[7:43] said, "But you were in here when they
[7:45] called."
[7:47] I said, "Oh, it's all right." And I went
[7:50] on out. There was one waiting man with a
[7:53] sick baby.
[7:56] All the way down to pray for that baby.
[7:58] My I just felt awful.
[8:01] Then when I got down there to pray for
[8:03] the baby, something said to me, "Wow,
[8:07] you are a liar.
[8:10] And you mean that you're going to lay
[8:12] your hands upon this baby?
[8:15] This man's come for about 400 miles for
[8:18] you to pray for this sick baby and and
[8:21] you just told a lie and had your wife to
[8:23] tell one.
[8:25] Then our hearts condemn us. You see that
[8:28] was wrong.
[8:29] So I said to the man, I said, "Mister,
[8:33] if you'll just hold your place, I'll
[8:36] pray for your baby, but I'm not worthy
[8:38] to pray for your baby." I said, "Because
[8:41] I've got something to make right before
[8:43] I pray for your baby."
[8:45] &gt;&gt; I said, "I've done something that's
[8:47] wrong and and my heart's condemning me,
[8:49] and I've got to go make it right first."
[8:54] And I tuck out down to the attorney's
[8:56] office and knocked on his door and he
[9:00] comes the door said, "I thought you were
[9:01] gone." I said, "I was only gone around
[9:04] behind the house while you were
[9:06] calling."
[9:08] And I said, "Sir, I tell you what I
[9:10] did." And I explained it to him. I said,
[9:12] "You all had me in such a fix." I said,
[9:15] "I I just didn't know you questioning me
[9:18] this way. Did they do this or did you
[9:20] see this?" And I said, I I told you
[9:23] everything I knew over and over and
[9:24] over. But I said, I told him I went to
[9:28] pray for a sick baby and what happened?
[9:30] And he said, walked got up out of his
[9:33] the seat and walked around behind his
[9:35] desk, looking me right in the eye, put
[9:37] his hand over on my shoulder, reached
[9:40] down, got my other hand. He said,
[9:41] "Brother Brandom, I always had
[9:43] confidence in you, but I got more than
[9:45] ever now."
[9:47] &gt;&gt; That made me feel good. Then I got in my
[9:51] car and went out to my little old cave
[9:54] where I go to pray. And I thought, now
[9:57] if you've got done wrong, go confess
[9:59] your wrong first, then come back to God.
[10:03] So I went out to my little cave and I'd
[10:04] prayed all afternoon. And I told the
[10:08] Lord, I sorry I did that. I I wasn't fit
[10:11] to pray for his people anymore.
[10:14] I couldn't have faith as long as I know
[10:16] I lied.
[10:18] I said, "You forgive me, Lord. I I and
[10:21] give me grace and I I won't do it
[10:23] anymore."
[10:24] I prayed till just long about time the
[10:27] sun was going down. There's a way back
[10:30] in the wilderness and uh a creek runs
[10:33] some three or four city blocks from
[10:35] where it's at down into a a valley.
[10:40] And I walked out. The foliage is heavy
[10:43] on the trees now.
[10:45] I standing on a great big rock after I
[10:47] come out of the cave to always it faces
[10:50] the east. I always go out after I pray
[10:53] for a day or two or hour or two stand on
[10:56] this rock and raise up my hands and
[10:58] praise the Lord. For someday I hope even
[11:02] if I am in the grave that when he comes
[11:05] I'll rise and see him coming from the
[11:08] east.
[11:09] And I stood on this great huge rock and
[11:12] had my hands up praising God.
[11:15] And I after I'd finished praising him, I
[11:18] dropped my hands down. I said, "Lord,
[11:21] one day Moses stood in the cliff of the
[11:25] rock
[11:27] and you passed by."
[11:30] I said, "If you forgive my sin, then you
[11:33] you're going to try me again.
[11:36] just passed by once more, Lord, to let
[11:40] me know that you've forgiven me and that
[11:44] my iniquity is all gone, and I shall go
[11:47] then and pray again for the sick people.
[11:51] You might not want to believe this, but
[11:55] at the judgment bar, you and I have to
[11:57] confess it again. You'll know it was
[11:59] true. There were justice still as it is
[12:04] in here, not no wind, nowhere. And right
[12:06] over to my side, a little whirlwind
[12:09] caught into the bushes. And here it come
[12:12] right along the side of the cave by me
[12:14] and went off down through the woods. I
[12:16] wept like a baby with both hands up in
[12:19] the air.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; If our hearts condemn us not, then we
[12:23] have confidence in God.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; But God will not answer us if there's
[12:30] something we're hiding in our hearts.
[12:35] So let's confess all our sins and wrongs
[12:39] and trust God to pour out his spirit in
[12:42] such a measure that there will be a
[12:44] great spiritual outpouring in this old
[12:48] camp meeting ground here. Whatever it is
[12:52] that sick people will be healed and
[12:54] sinners will be saved. Amen.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; I'll be praying for you and you pray for
[13:00] me and together God will bless us all.
[13:06] And now
[13:08] tonight I had to hurry and get here. We
[13:11] left a little later than we thought we
[13:14] were going to.
[13:16] And so I've chosen for a text found in
[13:20] the book of First Kings,
[13:23] the 17th chapter.
[13:26] and the 14th verse.
[13:30] I shall read it. And if I make a
[13:34] subject, I'd like to call it this.
[13:38] The reaction to an action.
[13:41] How you react on some action that you
[13:44] have taken.
[13:49] For thus saeth the Lord God of Israel,
[13:53] the barrel of meal shall not waste,
[13:57] neither shall the cru of oral fail until
[14:03] the day that the Lord sends rain upon
[14:06] the earth.
[14:10] It must have been a hot, weary morning.
[14:17] There had been about three years. There
[14:20] was no rain. Not even the dew would fall
[14:24] from the heavens.
[14:26] The land was scorched.
[14:30] No food was raised. And it was a
[14:34] terrible time.
[14:36] Hunger and death stalking the streets.
[14:40] People poverty stricken.
[14:43] No water.
[14:45] It was a reflection
[14:48] of sin and moral decay
[14:54] just like we have today
[14:57] of our age of juvenile problems and
[15:03] divorce problems and all the crime
[15:06] that's done in our nation. It's a
[15:09] reflection of our moral decay.
[15:18] no rain
[15:21] and she must have prayed all night long.
[15:30] Jezebel and her modern crowd had
[15:34] so socialized the religion and brought
[15:37] the whole nation into idolatry.
[15:43] It was the time of Ahab's reign.
[15:47] The most wicked king that Israel ever
[15:51] had
[15:54] for he was just a borderline believer.
[15:58] And that's the most wicked person that
[16:01] there is is a man or a woman that
[16:05] professes Christianity and just got
[16:08] enough of it to make them sick.
[16:12] to make them say, "I'd like to do that,
[16:14] but my religion won't let me do it. I
[16:17] shouldn't do it. That's the most
[16:20] miserable person I can think of."
[16:24] &gt;&gt; If that's all we had, we ought to bury
[16:26] that and go get something better.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; And Ahab had knuckled down to his
[16:35] idoltor wife and had brought all Israel
[16:38] into idolatry.
[16:41] And you'd say then, Brother Brandham,
[16:43] you compared it to today to our nation.
[16:46] Yes, sir. Our nation is greatly covered
[16:51] over with idolatry.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; We might not worship wooden animals and
[16:58] so forth as we want to think of
[17:00] idolatry, but that's not all idolatry
[17:03] consists of.
[17:05] We sometime make
[17:08] our automobiles and our clothes and the
[17:12] things that we do. We put an idols.
[17:15] Anything between you and God is an idol.
[17:20] Sometime we make our churches idols. We
[17:24] should never do that. God is the only
[17:28] one we should worship.
[17:32] The whole nation was
[17:35] governed of course by the rules and
[17:38] regulations of its king and the king had
[17:42] said this was all right. It was modern
[17:46] and all the people wanted to be modern
[17:48] just like we are today.
[17:52] We want to be modern.
[17:55] You could turn on your television and
[17:57] you find some woman smoking a cigarette
[18:01] said be modern use certain certain
[18:03] cigarettes.
[18:05] The next place is drinking beer and say
[18:08] be modern drink so and so.
[18:11] Well, we don't want to be modern. We
[18:13] want to be Christians.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; It's not the modernistic trim that we're
[18:21] trying to keep up with. It's going back
[18:23] to the old healing lines of God's word
[18:28] &gt;&gt; as Christians and living like men and
[18:31] women was supposed to live by the order
[18:34] of Almighty God.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "It's written that man shall
[18:39] not live by bread alone, but by every
[18:43] word that proceedth out of the mouth of
[18:45] God."
[18:47] &gt;&gt; We got to live by the word.
[18:52] But today we want to be modern like they
[18:55] were. And the government endorsed it.
[18:59] So does the government endorse it today.
[19:03] Why? A few years ago, 25 years ago, 50
[19:07] years,
[19:09] if women walked on the street then
[19:11] dressed like they're dressed now, they'd
[19:13] put them in jail.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; But the government endorses them.
[19:21] and we want to be modern.
[19:24] I'll state this with all respects to our
[19:27] government and our lands. It is a work
[19:30] of the devil.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; It's the devil at work.
[19:37] I'm just believing the oldfashioned
[19:40] unadulterated
[19:41] gospel truth of the Bible.
[19:46] But drinking used to be it wasn't
[19:50] immoral among the people.
[19:54] And now you find little bitty teenage
[19:56] children drunk.
[20:00] Card playing used to be wrong for the
[20:03] Christians. And now
[20:06] millions of so-called Christians have
[20:09] entertainment in their churches playing
[20:11] cards.
[20:14] giving away little cars and so forth,
[20:17] bunko.
[20:19] It's all nothing but plain lottery.
[20:24] And it's wrong and it's degrading to any
[20:28] nation,
[20:30] let alone a church of the living God.
[20:35] But the king said it was all right in
[20:38] their day. So
[20:40] they took down the altars of God and put
[20:44] up the altars of Baal.
[20:47] And today we've tucked down the
[20:50] oldfashioned banners of holiness
[20:53] and righteousness
[20:56] &gt;&gt; and put up the modern trend of
[20:59] denomination. We belong to certain
[21:01] certain great order.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; We call ourselves Christians because we
[21:06] belong to a certain order.
[21:08] That's not Christianity.
[21:11] Christianity is a born to get experience
[21:14] with God. Being filled with the Holy
[21:16] Ghost,
[21:18] &gt;&gt; cleaned up from a life of sin.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Living clean and holy before God
[21:25] and man.
[21:28] That takes the stain of death away.
[21:32] Death becomes an a victory.
[21:36] I was speaking with the wife this
[21:38] morning. I told her, I said, we was
[21:41] talking of death. I said, "Since I got
[21:45] saved 30 years ago as a boy, ever since
[21:50] then, it seems like I'm in a nightmare."
[21:53] &gt;&gt; She said, "What do you mean?" I said in
[21:57] this life something happened down in me
[22:01] that makes me know that there's a land
[22:03] somewhere and I'm shaking myself to wake
[22:06] up
[22:09] &gt;&gt; someday death will wake me into his
[22:11] presence.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Did you ever have a nightmare and just
[22:15] wanted to get out of it and you would
[22:18] jerking and jumping. You want to wake up
[22:21] because you know there's a reality
[22:22] somewhere that's far beyond that
[22:24] nightmare.
[22:26] So is it to every Christian born again
[22:30] always has been Abraham and Isaac and
[22:33] them said they were pilgrims and
[22:34] strangers. They were seeking a city to
[22:37] come.
[22:39] That's the way he was.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; We were going to the grocery a few weeks
[22:45] ago.
