[33:28] verily I said unto you that
[33:30] whosoever shall say unto this mountain

[33:39] and shall not doubt in his
[33:41] heart but shall believe that those
[33:44] things which he has said
[33:46] shall which he has said shall come to
[33:49] pass he shall have whatsoever he said
[33:53] therefore I said unto
[33:56] you what than whatever you
[33:59] desire when ye prayed
[34:03] be amen am the word of believing is to
[34:07] leave it there praise the Lord you

[34:35] seat praise the Lord the Lord bless you
[34:39] you may have your seat tonight I want to
[34:42] I want to do something uh Psalm chapter
[34:46] 119 if you want to turn to Psalm chapter
[34:51] 119 uh let's let's go there tonight I've
[34:54] been I've been looking for the way to
[34:56] speak on this Psalm Psalm 119 oh I was
[35:02] uh I was going to bring my Bible from
[35:04] the
[35:05] office the reason there is that this
[35:09] this uh pet Bible that we have here do
[35:12] not display PSM 100 Chapter 19 in the in
[35:17] the way that uh is supposed to be
[35:20] displayed now you
[35:23] remember uh uh you remember the story
[35:27] brother brandham told a story I want to
[35:30] read a few quotes of brother brandham
[35:31] here and it will it will it will carry
[35:33] us in a way that we will understand
[35:35] where I want to go
[35:37] tonight he first said one time in the
[35:40] message uh you must be born again and uh
[35:47] uh uh he said this
[35:50] U someone was telling brother Brandon
[35:54] why are you now teaching the people
[35:55] spiritual gift you know the believe
[35:57] believe you to be a prophet so he said
[36:00] this he says uh why in the word don't
[36:02] you leave them women you know someone
[36:04] was telling brother Brandon why don't
[36:06] you leave them women and men
[36:10] alone to me said uh yeah bring it bring
[36:14] it thank you thank you I just I just
[36:17] want to show a picture of uh of of what
[36:21] I want to refer to tonight I'll show it
[36:23] to
[36:26] you now wrong with the Bible here on the
[36:28] pit just that it does not have setting
[36:31] display that's that's the reason
[36:33] why why in the word don't you leave them
[36:36] women and men alone to me and said why
[36:41] then the people believe you to be a
[36:43] prophet I said I'm that but the people
[36:46] believe you to be why don't you teach
[36:48] them how to receive
[36:51] Vision how to do the works of God like
[36:55] that I said how can I teach them
[36:59] algebra when they don't know their ABCs
[37:03] right amen now I want I want to talk
[37:06] about ABCs tonight in a in a way uh uh
[37:11] so that's that's the reason why I'm
[37:13] reading this
[37:16] um how can you teach them algebra when
[37:18] they don't know their ABC see how can
[37:21] you take a child out of kindergarten and
[37:25] give him a college education
[37:28] today teach him square roots and measure
[37:33] how can you do it when he don't know
[37:36] what ABC means you know what ABC means
[37:42] always believe Christ amen Jesus said
[37:46] when you stand praying believe so he
[37:49] taking us back to our ABC amen that is
[37:54] the principle thing when you stand
[37:56] praying believe
[37:58] ABC means always believe Christ that's
[38:01] right uh don't believe the church don't
[38:05] believe their Creeds don't believe their
[38:07] Doctrine believe Christ why to to him to
[38:12] know him to know him is life is that
[38:15] right not know his
[38:18] Creed uh he and got no Creed not to even
[38:24] know his
[38:25] word to know
[38:28] his word you got to know him know him as
[38:33] your savior in the New Birth so he's
[38:37] he's telling us it's important for us to
[38:39] know the ABCs of the scripture the ABCs
[38:44] of uh of the things of God you know the
[38:46] common things and and these are the
[38:49] things that are slipping away from us
[38:52] amen we uh we uh we we are paying
[38:56] attention to the Myster we are paying
[38:58] attention to the manifestation of the
[39:00] sons of God uh uh speaking things into
[39:04] existence and these things are slipping
[39:07] away from us but we have to realize that
[39:10] the ABCs are the
[39:12] foundation praise the Lord amen the ABCs
[39:17] of the scripture are the foundation if
[39:20] you if you get the ABCs wrong I mean
[39:23] there is nothing you will get right you
[39:26] see in your AR ra problem they put a uh
[39:30] uh to the square root of B and all of
[39:33] that that goes back to ABC so if you
[39:36] don't know ABC in the value of ABC there
[39:39] is no way you will know algebra praise
[39:42] the Lord are we together now brother
[39:46] Brandon will tell another
[39:48] story uh and this story is very familiar
[39:51] to us let's just read uh impersonation
[39:54] of Christ impersonation of Christianity
[39:57] a little boy one time down
[39:59] south there was a saying that he was
[40:04] kneeling in a road where he had been
[40:08] ploughing a clergy Man passed by and
[40:11] heard the little fellow
[40:13] repeating the alphabet A B C D and so
[40:17] forth and he was on his knees so the
[40:20] clergy man was uh very much uh uh
[40:25] Disturbed so he he heard the little boy
[40:29] repeat the alphabet and then say amen
[40:32] and so he got up while the clery spoke
[40:35] to him and said
[40:36] Sonny uh I'm a servant of the Lord and I
[40:39] heard you praying but you were only
[40:42] saying the
[40:43] afet and I don't understand why you were
[40:48] just saying the afret he said sir I
[40:51] can't
[40:52] pray I had a Praying I had never prayed
[40:56] but I h a Praying Mother and Father
[41:00] which has done gone to
[41:02] heaven and
[41:04] said mother she died when I was such a
[41:08] little boy but I remember of I remember
[41:11] of hearing her when she was in trouble
[41:16] she went to the Lord and she
[41:19] prayed and she died when I was so young
[41:24] so she couldn't teach me to pray
[41:28] and I have been
[41:30] given into the hands of an unkind person
[41:34] who beats me in a
[41:36] mistreatment and I thought maybe after I
[41:39] have learned my ABCs if I could take all
[41:44] the all the words or say all the letters
[41:48] maybe he could put it together and
[41:51] understand what I
[41:54] meant that's the prayer of
[41:59] sincerity not knowing how to pray but
[42:02] he's just saying his ABC and say Lord
[42:05] you just put it
[42:07] together praise the Lord once again
[42:10] going back to the
[42:14] ABCs that's the
[42:16] sincerity certainly he could put them
[42:19] together is not how we pray in our lips
[42:25] is the motives of our heart is what God
[42:31] hear he sometimes don't hear our lips he
[42:35] hear Our
[42:37] intention what the motives of our heart
[42:41] are we together this little L did not
[42:44] know how to pray but he he know he ABC
[42:47] so he said well I'll just I just repeat
[42:49] the ABC now he has a need he's being
[42:52] mistreated he's missing his father and
[42:55] his mother he has a serious just need
[42:58] and don't know how to express it to God
[43:00] Paul told us in the Book of Romans we
[43:02] don't know how to pray I don't know how
[43:05] how smart we think we are he says we
[43:07] don't know how to pray it is the spirit
[43:10] that make intercession it's when that
[43:13] burden in your heart is when you are
[43:16] engaged in that burden in your heart
[43:19] that is the thing that connects to the
[43:20] throne of God Amen that's the thing that
[43:23] God sees it's not our our English
[43:25] language or whatever language language
[43:27] we speak are we together now so what I
[43:30] wanted to do tonight I just wanted to
[43:33] just do something a little
[43:35] bit uh uh all of these thoughts came to
[43:39] me uh uh um I
[43:42] studying uh uh Psalm chapter 119 is the
[43:47] longest Psalm in the Bible and if I'm
[43:50] not mistaken it it should be the longest
[43:53] chapter in the Bible praise the Lorden
[43:56] uh uh uh it has about
[44:01] 176
[44:03] verses if you study Psalm chapter if you
[44:08] study Psalm chapter
[44:10] 119 you will realize that the suit did
[44:14] something very
[44:17] beautiful he did something very very
[44:21] beautiful I just I've just been trying
[44:23] to find a way to bring it to you and I
[44:26] hope that the Lord will help us tonight
[44:28] he did something beautiful because the
[44:30] way that Psalm 119 is designed I wanted
[44:34] to show you it you see it it it breaks
[44:37] with little
[44:38] titles right all these little
[44:42] titles are the 22 letters in the aphabet
[44:47] in the Hebrew
[44:49] aphabet so the psalm took each
[44:53] letter in the Hebrew aphabet
[44:57] and he expressed praises to
[45:03] God praise the Lord amen he took each
[45:08] letter of the Hebrew
[45:10] alphabet I
[45:13] forgot I had a I had a image uh that
[45:18] that that string shorted I did not send
[45:20] it uh they will have shown you
[45:24] it I didn't bring my phone okay it's
[45:26] okay it's
[45:28] okay so I I will showing you what what
[45:31] he did is that the way he designed it
[45:34] the way the suit on the inspiration did
[45:38] is that from the first letter the first
[45:41] letter uh uh uh in the Hebrew alphabet
[45:45] is is Olive which is where Psalm chapter
[45:49] uh 191 start from so with that Olive if
[45:53] you look in the Hebrew Bible you will
[45:55] see every verse verse started with an
[46:01] olive every verse started with an
[46:07] olive then he goes and the Beautiful
[46:09] Thing also is that every verse every uh
[46:14] uh uh uh uh of those segment of
[46:19] verses in the in the in the
[46:22] Bible is eight verses
[46:27] praise the
[46:31] Lord I'm not a musicians but the
[46:34] musicians can tell you
[46:39] better on the on the
[46:44] piano the piano is designed in a
[46:48] way that it takes eight verses I mean
[46:53] eight calls in the space of eight calls
[46:57] in a space of Eight
[46:58] Keys you see she say there you go
[47:01] because I'm not a musician you know in
[47:04] the space of eight keys to make a
[47:09] call and every eight
[47:12] Keys is an
[47:15] alive now so you see this is a Musical
[47:20] musical
[47:24] design you think about it now yeah there
[47:27] is this little boy that don't know how
[47:30] to
[47:32] pray but he has been able to design a
[47:36] way to be able to speak to
[47:41] God lord you know my heart you know my
[47:44] needs I don't know how to pray but you
[47:47] know my
[47:48] needs and he says he kept repeating his
[47:51] ABC ab B C D or he gets to Z he goes
[47:54] back again AB b c d he just is right
[47:57] there AB B C D and and and and and and I
[48:01] mean anybody would think that he was he
[48:03] was
[48:05] crazy praise the Lorden are we together
[48:10] now so uh uh uh the
[48:14] psalmist just like I said every every uh
[48:19] every
[48:21] verse I uh I read this home with with
[48:25] the kids and we
[48:27] we did a very
[48:29] beautiful beautiful thing where we took
[48:33] each eight
[48:35] verse and then uh we had to repeat
[48:38] something just like he started in verse
[48:41] uh one
[48:44] blessed are the
[48:46] undefiled in the way who WTH in the laws
[48:49] of the Lord verse two he goes blessed
[48:52] are they that keep verse three will be
[48:54] blessed if then the next one will be
[48:57] praises to Him that is on the mountain
[48:59] praises to Him that created the Heaven
[49:01] and the Earth praises to Him that that
[49:04] gave me life praises to Him that wake me
[49:06] up this
[49:09] morning then the next one will be glory
[49:12] to God in the highest and that that's
[49:14] just how he went when you look in the
[49:16] Hebrew Bible that's how it's
[49:18] designed are we together amen now I'm
[49:21] saying this
[49:23] tonight to be able to tell you or
[49:27] encourage you the importance of going
[49:30] back
[49:31] to to the
[49:33] ABCs when I say going back to the ABCs I
[49:37] think is it's going back to those things
[49:41] of value going back to those things that
[49:45] that are
[49:46] fundamental and not uh not to be caught
[49:49] up in all of the
[49:54] uh not to be caught up in in all of the
[49:58] there is there is one there is one group
[50:01] of
[50:02] uh I'm trying to see if I can find it
[50:07] quickly there is only two if you look in
[50:10] verse 30
[50:12] 137 righteous are doubt oh Lord uh the
[50:17] upright and upright at the Judgment that
[50:22] testimony that testimony then he goes
[50:26] down to verse vers 40 Thy word then he
[50:28] goes down to verse 41 uh uh uh thy
[50:32] precept I I I'm smart and despised yet I
[50:36] forget not that precept in in verse 142
[50:40] that righteousness in uh in uh uh uh 143
[50:45] you will see thy commandment if you read
[50:47] down you're going to see it and and just
[50:49] like that
[50:54] now when the P was doing
[50:58] this he was not doing it for theological
[51:02] studies he was doing it as his
[51:06] expression to
[51:10] God as a praise I'm I'm going to take
[51:13] the the the the alret the the the 22
[51:17] letters in the in in the alret and I'm
[51:20] going to just run the
[51:24] praise to God
[51:27] praise the Lord
[51:35] Amen brother BR would talk about uh uh
[51:38] uh not growing in a Christian home and
[51:41] when the Lord started dealing with him
[51:42] he says I didn't know how to pray it's a
[51:44] boy that was out there in the wooding
[51:47] and uh wanted to talk to God I didn't
[51:50] know how to do it but then I wrote on a
[51:53] piece of paper and I he say I stuck it
[51:56] on the tree
[51:57] and say God lord I know you can
[52:02] read when you pass by please read my
[52:05] not that is coming from a
[52:09] s a a death of
[52:13] sincerity this is somebody expressing
[52:16] something to God like Hezekiah said
[52:19] after the syan send him and Note and
[52:21] said we coming down there we're going to
[52:23] car everyone he go right down there put
[52:25] the note right to the to the Altar and
[52:28] said God this is what the king of Syria
[52:32] said praise the Lord I mean he can go on
[52:35] his knees and say Jehovah You Deliver Us
[52:38] from from from from uh H Ramset in Egypt
[52:41] you open the red seed Lord you were the
[52:44] pillow of Fire by night you were the
[52:45] pillow of cloud by day he could have
[52:47] done all of that praise the Lord amen
[52:51] but you see sometimes uh uh uh when you
[52:54] have a when you have a when you have a
[52:57] true burden when you have when you are
[52:59] overburdened let me say it that way when
[53:01] you are
[53:03] overwhelmed praise the Lord amen amen it
[53:07] is just it is just at a place where uh
[53:10] uh uh uh uh religion or the church you
[53:14] know has has designed our mind to
[53:17] understand that you know you got to get
[53:19] on your knees you got to close your eyes
[53:21] and you got to find this place where
[53:22] nobody will hear you you know and and
[53:25] and because of that
[53:27] we don't take the time to be able to say
[53:30] things to God out of our
[53:35] heart because we don't find our best
[53:37] place to
[53:40] pray the moment where we supposed to cry
[53:44] out to God and just and just let it
[53:48] out we don't do
[53:52] it because our mind has been so
[53:55] factioned by religion that we have to do
[53:58] it a certain way at a certain time at a
[54:02] certain place before God will hear
[54:09] it are we
[54:12] together praise the
[54:14] Lord going back to the ABCs now so uh uh
[54:19] uh I just I just uh I just thought on
[54:22] there I just wanted to encourage you a
[54:24] little bit like I said I just on that
[54:27] and uh uh uh you know just just to
[54:31] encourage you that uh uh I mean you have
[54:35] to invest on your prayer life brother
[54:36] bam says it's one of the sacri virtue
[54:39] that God gave to the church amen that's
[54:42] one of the sacri virtue that that God
[54:44] gave to the church he says that right
[54:46] here in invisible Union we have read
[54:48] that before I'm going to pick it up here
[54:51] he says now she has a sacred one
[54:57] uh I want to name three things here that
[55:01] she must not get away
[55:04] from he says I want to need three things
[55:08] that she must not get away
[55:13] from he says now I'm I'm I'm speaking
[55:17] keep the church in
[55:19] mind why I'm speaking this to the
[55:22] Natural Woman but what have we done we
[55:25] have left the church and we run after
[55:29] the Natural
[55:31] Woman praise the Lord amen oh say she
[55:35] might have a mother who say she might
[55:37] have a a woman who oh say she you know
[55:41] you know we have left he says keep the
[55:43] church in mind I'm only using the woman
[55:46] as a
[55:48] type but the church must not get away
[55:51] from these three things
[55:58] are we
[56:01] together now he goes down he says uh
[56:04] what what what a Sac chust I've spoken
[56:07] this before and uh uh h brother B taught
[56:10] us right there he says the reason why is
[56:12] because the promise of redemption was
[56:15] given to the woman it was not the man's
[56:17] seed it was the woman's seed that would
[56:19] bruise the head of the seing if we only
[56:22] understand the unique place that a woman
[56:25] H uh
[56:26] uh uh uh uh uh take before God I I don't
[56:31] want to get out of track tonight I I
[56:33] don't want to get out of track tonight
[56:34] there is something that is making me to
[56:36] say there but I will I might I might
[56:40] just address it let me stay right where
[56:43] I am tonight what a sacred trust what a
[56:47] responsibility to a woman see now see
[56:52] why she is a type of the
[56:55] church which has the same responsibility
[56:58] as a woman has a sacred responsibility
[57:01] to her motherhood to her virtue to her
[57:05] husband the church has a Sac
[57:08] responsibility to prayer to the word to
[57:11] Christ and what he said from there the
[57:14] three things that she must not get away
[57:19] from praise the Lord
[57:26] she must not get away
[57:30] from because we we will just be having a
[57:33] form of godliness or having a form of
[57:36] message believer and and we will not
[57:38] have the
[57:40] power because a prayerless Christian is
[57:42] a powerless Christian there is no way
[57:45] you can bring this word to pass there is
[57:47] no way you can believe
[57:51] God for fulfilling his word in your life
[57:57] if you are not on speaking terms with
[57:59] God there is no
[58:01] way if you are now on speaking terms
[58:03] with God there is no
[58:08] way it it it would just become a slogan
[58:11] in our mou or the tpol the manifestation
[58:13] of the sons of God you know speaking
[58:15] missing LS back into place all of those
[58:17] things will just become a a slogan and
[58:21] that's why it has become he says three
[58:23] things that she must not get away from
[58:28] her responsibility to prayer to the
[58:31] word her responsibility to pray your to
[58:35] and to the word you have a
[58:38] responsibility daily responsibility to
[58:40] this
[58:45] word are we
[58:48] together okay that's not what I want to
[58:50] talk about
[58:51] tonight let's go to 2 King
[58:55] chapter
[58:58] 14 while I come to church tonight the
[59:01] Lord kind of drop little thing in my
[59:03] heart uh toss tonight and I want to pick
[59:07] on
[59:11] that because I've never told you what
[59:13] I'm speaking on
[59:15] tonight I want to speak on a
[59:18] parable a parable that uh a lady said to
[59:23] to David one time I give you the
[59:25] background of the story and then we will
[59:27] read the
[59:28] scripture David saw Absalon had stood
[59:32] against his
[59:33] father and uh uh and he have k kick
[59:37] David and the rest of the men out of
[59:39] Israel he was going to take and and
[59:42] joab
[59:46] joab uh if you if you know the
[59:50] relationship of joab to
[59:54] David you he will understand why joab
[59:59] because joab was uh he was like an uncle
[1:00:05] he was related to David even as as as an
[1:00:08] in-law Al so I will bring you to the
[1:00:10] real uh relationship but he was related
[1:00:12] to David that's the reason why he was
[1:00:15] very he was very very dedicated and joab
[1:00:20] was not happy when Absalon was
[1:00:22] misbehaving he was not happy praise Lord
[1:00:26] amen amen now you have to realize that
[1:00:30] nathon has already told David that the
[1:00:34] the one that will that will take the
[1:00:36] throne after David will be
[1:00:39] Solomon which of course it was not it
[1:00:42] was not highly you know uh it was not a
[1:00:45] highly favored thing because everybody
[1:00:48] knew what happened between uh David and
[1:00:51] BBA now but uh but that was that was the
[1:00:54] way that God designed it amen that was
[1:00:57] the way that God designed it because uh
[1:01:00] we our coming to the Earth would come
[1:01:02] through adultery the SE in Eve it was an
[1:01:05] adultery amen so God was also trying to
[1:01:10] to bring a
[1:01:12] type you know he was trying to bring a
[1:01:14] tipe now so so uh uh uh uh joab was not
[1:01:20] happy so uh joab decided that I I I get
[1:01:26] hold of this boy he knew David heart
[1:01:29] towards Absalon and uh uh so
[1:01:33] joab set up the man and he you know he
[1:01:36] he he instructed the man and did
[1:01:39] everything I mean joab work he worked
[1:01:41] behind the scene he went and told uh uh
[1:01:44] someone to go and and tell AIT that uh
[1:01:47] you know uh uh uh uh how the battle was
[1:01:51] going to be set and all of that and I
[1:01:54] gave a wrong counsel they never cut
[1:01:56] David he hang himself and joab was
[1:01:59] working behind the
[1:02:00] scene and finally joab will command that
[1:02:05] uh anyone that get the the board absolon
[1:02:07] you kill
[1:02:08] him he knew that was a direct dis order
[1:02:12] to the king but he wanted to deal with
[1:02:14] this mod so Absalon ran and absolon hang
[1:02:17] himself because he was he was out
[1:02:19] growing his head and he was trying to
[1:02:21] pass a tree and and his head got stuck
[1:02:23] in the tree he hanged himself and then
[1:02:25] he was killed David heard the story that
[1:02:28] David was
[1:02:29] weeping David was
[1:02:32] unconsolable nobody could consel him he
[1:02:35] was crying and crying and crying and uh
[1:02:38] and and and you know and and David
[1:02:40] called his man and ask them and says uh
[1:02:43] tell me is joab hand in this you know
[1:02:47] and uh you know and and somebody told
[1:02:49] joab I mean uh David that yeah you know
[1:02:52] joab this this is how joab instructed
[1:02:55] and this this this and all of that so so
[1:02:58] joab now being a wise man also a man of
[1:03:02] war he decided to go and meet this
[1:03:05] woman that's her story we will read here
[1:03:08] in 2 King chapter 14 let's go there
[1:03:12] quickly this is a Wednesday night we
[1:03:14] don't have a lot of time on our hands
[1:03:16] verse one which tells us now joab the
[1:03:19] son of zero perceived that the king
[1:03:21] heart was towards Absalon and joab sent
[1:03:25] to C and FH and fesh hands a wise woman
[1:03:29] and said unto her I pray thee frame
[1:03:32] thyself uh to be a mooner and put on now

[1:03:39] with oil but be as a woman that have a
[1:03:43] long time mouring for the dead and come
[1:03:46] to the king and speak and and and and
[1:03:49] speak on this
[1:03:51] manner uh unto him so joah put words in
[1:03:55] her mouth he built a story praise the
[1:03:57] Lord amen and the the story that he
[1:04:02] built he buil the story using David
[1:04:08] condition but the woman is putting it in
[1:04:11] the place of
[1:04:14] her lossing her
[1:04:16] son are we together so he put words in
[1:04:20] the woman mouth and when the the the
[1:04:23] woman of tea speak unto the king
[1:04:26] speaking to David she fell on her face
[1:04:28] to the ground and did obedient and said
[1:04:30] oh King help oh king and the King said
[1:04:34] unto her what Li the and she answered I
[1:04:38] I I am indeed a wiow woman and my
[1:04:40] husband is dead and the head men have
[1:04:43] two sons and uh and uh they two stro
[1:04:48] together in the field and there was none

[1:04:57] family is Raising against the hmet and
[1:05:00] and they said deliver him that stone his

[1:05:07] Lord for the life of his brother whom he
[1:05:10] slayed and we will we will destroy the
[1:05:15] hells also and
[1:05:17] so they shall quench the C which is let
[1:05:22] amen you remember we talk about letting
[1:05:24] the Candlestick and now in the fire to
[1:05:26] go off so what actually she's saying
[1:05:28] here my husband is dead I having two
[1:05:31] sons one killed the other one and now
[1:05:34] the whole tribe want to kill my son if
[1:05:36] they do kill him we will not have a
[1:05:38] representative we will we will not have
[1:05:40] anybody to carry the touch of his
[1:05:44] father we will lost our
[1:05:46] inheritance are we together so she's
[1:05:50] she's making the she's making her case
[1:05:53] serious to the king that this is a
[1:05:55] matter of my
[1:05:58] inheritance are we
[1:06:03] together now uh verse 8 and the King
[1:06:06] said unto the woman go go to that house
[1:06:09] and and and I will give a charge
[1:06:12] concerning theed and the woman of said
[1:06:14] unto the king oh my Lord oh
[1:06:17] King the iniquity uh uh the iniquity be
[1:06:21] on me and on my father house and the
[1:06:23] king and the King and his throne be
[1:06:28] Guiltless and the King said what
[1:06:31] whatsoever whosoever said unto thee
[1:06:35] bring him to me and he shall not touch
[1:06:38] thee
[1:06:39] anymore praise the Lord amen then said
[1:06:42] she I pray thee let the king
[1:06:46] remember let let the king remember the
[1:06:49] Lord thy God that thou who not suffer
[1:06:52] the the venge of blood to destroy
[1:06:54] anymore
[1:06:56] least they destroy my son and he said as
[1:07:00] the Lord liveth it looks like David was
[1:07:02] found to be you know taking taking place
[1:07:06] on the word because it was almost the
[1:07:07] same thing that naan did to him there as
[1:07:11] the Lord live there shall n one head of
[1:07:14] thy son fall to the Earth then the woman
[1:07:18] said let uh let that helmet I pray thee
[1:07:22] say one word unto my Lord the king
[1:07:27] and he said say on now it is almost like
[1:07:31] the king is giving his word he expect
[1:07:33] for the woman to believe it and go from
[1:07:35] his presence but he keep finding the
[1:07:38] woman coming back and keep bringing the
[1:07:41] story back to him again so pretty soon
[1:07:44] David is either becoming agitated or
[1:07:47] David is becoming concerned that this
[1:07:50] looks like a
[1:07:52] setup praise the Lord because the King
[1:07:56] has given his
[1:07:58] word praise the Lord and when the king
[1:08:01] speaks to you it is enough you don't
[1:08:04] need a pastor between you and the King
[1:08:08] amen if the King has spoken to you take
[1:08:11] his word and go with it praise the Lord
[1:08:15] but she keeps coming back again so watch
[1:08:17] how how the the the the how it plays out
[1:08:21] here and the woman said wherefore then
[1:08:23] have thou taught such a think against
[1:08:26] the people of God for the king dog speak
[1:08:30] this thing as one which is faultless now
[1:08:34] she turning the story on
[1:08:38] David how can you think how can you
[1:08:41] think about things like this on the
[1:08:44] people of God what is she saying
[1:08:46] somebody has taken our King off the
[1:08:49] throne and this very person that
[1:08:51] rebelled against the kingdom is dead and
[1:08:54] now you want to forsake your duty
[1:08:57] because a rebellious Man is
[1:09:02] dead that's what she's saying she
[1:09:04] turning the thing in the face of the
[1:09:07] king watch let's go
[1:09:14] ahead and a woman said where wherefore
[1:09:17] then have thou taught such a thing
[1:09:19] against the people of God for the king
[1:09:22] does speak this as one which is
[1:09:25] faultless in that the king does not fish
[1:09:31] home again his
[1:09:35] banish for for we must need
[1:09:38] died and as a water spilled on the
[1:09:42] ground cannot be gathered up again
[1:09:47] neither does God respect any person yet
[1:09:51] thus he devis means that his that his
[1:09:56] banish be not expel from him praise the
[1:10:00] Lord now so I'm going to just take a
[1:10:03] phrase from there water spilled on the
[1:10:05] ground cannot be gathered again that's
[1:10:07] what I want to speak on
[1:10:10] tonight so that's your story you can
[1:10:12] read the rest of it when you go home but
[1:10:14] I will get into my inspiration tonight
[1:10:17] amen a water spilled to the ground
[1:10:20] cannot be
[1:10:23] gathered what is done is
[1:10:27] done praise the Lord amen amen now Jesus
[1:10:32] said when you stand
[1:10:34] pray if you have ought against anybody
[1:10:39] forgive praise the Lord that's that's a
[1:10:42] very very important statement because
[1:10:46] brother Brandon says faith is the found
[1:10:49] I mean forgiveness is the foundation of
[1:10:51] Faith that's why he said in uh the
[1:10:54] statue of man he said forgiveness is the
[1:10:59] foundation of Faith praise the Lord amen
[1:11:03] amen you cannot have true faith that is
[1:11:07] expressed to God when you have all in
[1:11:11] your heart against somebody or holding
[1:11:13] something against somebody what has
[1:11:15] happened has already happened that's
[1:11:18] right praise the Lord and waterers
[1:11:20] spilled to the ground and you cannot
[1:11:22] gather
[1:11:23] it praise the
[1:11:26] lord it's the same way we've wasted time
[1:11:29] you can't get
[1:11:31] it if you waste your times you can't
[1:11:34] gather that time
[1:11:37] back that's the reason why Paul says
[1:11:40] redeem the time because the days are
[1:11:42] evil it's not to go back and get the
[1:11:45] wasted time but manage your time that's
[1:11:48] what it means manage your time be
[1:11:51] productive in your time because wasted
[1:11:54] time can never be gathered
[1:11:56] again are we together amen praise the
[1:11:59] Lord now you see what I'm coming to
[1:12:01] tonight and I hope that uh uh it's it's
[1:12:04] a blessing to you
[1:12:08] amen so uh uh this is a parable it's a
[1:12:12] it's a very powerful Parable a a a story
[1:12:16] of forgiveness and
[1:12:18] Redemption is a story of
[1:12:21] redemption praise the Lord amen
[1:12:27] if you read the rest of the story you
[1:12:29] you will realize that the Lord used that
[1:12:33] situation to get David off of his uh H
[1:12:38] how can I call it his Mooney bed and and
[1:12:41] his his grumpy State and and uh uh uh to
[1:12:45] get off of his state of uh uh uh uh
[1:12:48] regret and whatever whatever condition
[1:12:50] he was in because it was not a healthy
[1:12:52] condition
[1:12:55] praise the Lord the way that God
[1:12:58] ordained of bringing a king to a throne
[1:13:01] was not the way that Absalon
[1:13:04] followed for a while the people rejoiced
[1:13:07] and celebrated after him but I mean
[1:13:09] there were people in the land that knew
[1:13:12] that this is not the way that God
[1:13:14] ordained for us to have
[1:13:18] King are we
[1:13:21] together if Absalon is dead he's dead
[1:13:23] let's bury him let's move on they are
[1:13:25] important things for us to take care of
[1:13:29] Praise the Lord we need to save the
[1:13:31] kingdom we need to save the church we
[1:13:33] have our family to save we have we have
[1:13:36] things to pay attention to Let's startop
[1:13:39] wasting time on
[1:13:44] foolishness praise the
[1:13:46] Lord because it's not going to help
[1:13:51] you it's not going to help you
[1:13:57] for the matter of fact in the way that
[1:13:59] brother that Jesus Christ taught uh uh
[1:14:02] uh uh uh uh unforgiving unforgiving
[1:14:06] spirit he Tau about it in a way that uh
[1:14:09] uh if you have an unforgiving spirit in
[1:14:12] your life Jesus said you are tormented
[1:14:16] by
[1:14:19] demons simple he gave the parable about
[1:14:23] this man that was in his bus little
[1:14:26] money the bus forgive him but he will
[1:14:28] not forgive his friend what did Jesus
[1:14:30] say at the end of that Parable grab him
[1:14:33] and turn him to the tormenters that's
[1:14:36] right that's what Jesus
[1:14:41] said so what what is the what is the
[1:14:43] sense of that it is on forgiving Spirit
[1:14:47] expose you to
[1:14:50] Demons it expose you to being Ted
[1:14:55] amen dragging things in your mind even
[1:14:59] even with your own your own life it
[1:15:01] don't have to be somebody praise the
[1:15:04] Lord
[1:15:06] amen if you filed the Lord and you did
[1:15:10] something that was not right you get on
[1:15:12] your knees Jesus said when you pray
[1:15:14] believe confess your fault put it under
[1:15:16] the blood and be able to go past
[1:15:20] that because you see what it is is that
[1:15:23] uh uh uh uh many people are stuck in
[1:15:29] their
[1:15:32] past they are stuck in their past they
[1:15:34] cannot go they cannot go into a bright
[1:15:38] future they cannot go into a glorious
[1:15:41] future they cannot go into a Redemptive
[1:15:44] future that is waiting for
[1:15:47] them they are so stuck in that because
[1:15:52] their God is a God that you know a god
[1:15:55] of Vengeance that is so angry with them
[1:15:58] he's so angry that he wakes them up in
[1:16:00] the morning and he gets so angry with
[1:16:03] them he wake you up and he's angry with
[1:16:05] you why he wake you up
[1:16:11] then are we
[1:16:18] together so we we we have to we have to
[1:16:21] look at this and and the reason why I'm
[1:16:23] saying this is that because you have to
[1:16:25] remember I read right here where brother
[1:16:27] Brandon says he says that uh these three
[1:16:31] things that she must not get away
[1:16:35] from she must not get away from those
[1:16:39] are sacred VT those are sacred trust
[1:16:43] that is given to the church let me tell
[1:16:46] you you don't learn how to pray you
[1:16:51] don't uh uh uh you don't you don't you
[1:16:54] don't go to school for it you don't you
[1:16:56] don't buy it I mean I mean uh h h h
[1:16:59] getting on speaking terms with God
[1:17:01] creating a relationship with the
[1:17:03] invisible God believing that angels are
[1:17:07] come about you you don't pay money for
[1:17:09] that it's not your natural birth right
[1:17:13] it's not because you are born in a
[1:17:15] message that's the reason
[1:17:16] why we are becoming an intitle and we
[1:17:20] are losing those
[1:17:22] values we are losing them
[1:17:26] that's the reason why we are becoming
[1:17:29] powerless all we can do is to just F and
[1:17:32] back and for and
[1:17:33] back when we supposed to learn to take
[1:17:36] thing to take things to God In Prayer
[1:17:39] what a friend we have in Jesus that's
[1:17:41] the song We Sing take everything to the
[1:17:44] Lord in prayer what a privilege when we
[1:17:46] sing the song we are standing on Holy
[1:17:49] Ground amen and I Know Thy Angels amen
[1:17:53] is not a record
[1:17:55] amen it's a
[1:17:56] reality
[1:18:01] amen David said as the mountain surround
[1:18:04] Jerusalem so the Lord surround His
[1:18:09] People
[1:18:14] amen are we
[1:18:16] together we we take these things to be
[1:18:18] so common and and and and we are just we
[1:18:21] are just losing those things that that
[1:18:24] that that that that they are the
[1:18:26] fundamental value of our faith
[1:18:29] fundamental
[1:18:31] value they are fundamental value of our
[1:18:41] faith we must not hear the word of God
[1:18:44] to to just pick up a
[1:18:48] nugget people listening to the message
[1:18:51] just want oh why brother Bri said this
[1:18:52] and so they can be the first one to send
[1:18:54] that's not the reason we must be falling
[1:18:56] in love with
[1:19:00] Jesus we must be falling in love with
[1:19:02] Jesus it must be how we can apply that
[1:19:05] word to our life how can I apply it to
[1:19:07] me oh God speak to me let your word
[1:19:11] change my
[1:19:12] life now how much cat I can send to
[1:19:16] people to show how I'm reading the
[1:19:19] message and you know I'm so inspired and
[1:19:21] and I'm connected and I mean all of
[1:19:23] those things they are just wasted time
[1:19:26] that's
[1:19:30] right this whole thing is about
[1:19:32] relationship it's a father amen that
[1:19:36] called us as his children wanting us to
[1:19:39] know that there is none special we are
[1:19:42] all his children he love all us all the
[1:19:46] same
[1:19:51] Amen brother talk the story about scking
[1:19:54] his foot out and and and and and and
[1:19:56] Becky say oh I get all of that he says I
[1:19:59] stretched my foot out on the side and
[1:20:00] Sarah came all the side and and Sarah
[1:20:02] says you get all of daddy but Daddy get
[1:20:04] all of me and that's the same thing that
[1:20:06] God do to every one of us we all can
[1:20:10] have access to God there are no special
[1:20:13] men and with special gift and special we
[1:20:16] it's we must not limit
[1:20:23] God but what are we doing
[1:20:26] doing we are wasting precious things
[1:20:30] Jesus said it this way he
[1:20:34] says
[1:20:36] casting purse before
[1:20:40] swarms you see that's what we must not
[1:20:45] do that's what we must not
[1:20:53] do praise the Lord L amen amen there is
[1:20:57] no there is no uh H uh uh menu book that
[1:21:01] you read in the message how to dress and
[1:21:04] how to how to do this as as the Lord is
[1:21:07] giving Grace for us to to appreciate
[1:21:12] decency and and and and and and and
[1:21:15] create boundaries in our lives those
[1:21:17] those things does not come by your
[1:21:18] natural
[1:21:21] birth the reason why that that that
[1:21:24] Grace is upon you is because you are
[1:21:27] hanging around the word leave this word
[1:21:30] you will be surprised how you will dress
[1:21:32] to go out there leave this word or let
[1:21:35] the word leave
[1:21:38] you you will be
[1:21:41] surprised that's the reason why we still
[1:21:44] we still sit under the word and and I
[1:21:46] mean we we we are just we are just
[1:21:48] managing all our W and all our thing we
[1:21:51] are managing it
[1:21:55] why because we're getting away
[1:21:58] from from the things that were that were
[1:22:01] that were that were
[1:22:15] precious Paul says we are Washed by the
[1:22:17] Water of the word
[1:22:29] all of these things that
[1:22:32] Grace set before us give to us
[1:22:37] freely they they are no longer valuable
[1:22:40] to us it's all about
[1:22:44] self-impression we are all about wanting
[1:22:47] to impress somebody who you want to
[1:22:49] impress
[1:22:56] glory be to God Amen are we
[1:23:01] together I hope I'm making sense here
[1:23:05] amen see here let me read another story
[1:23:08] to
[1:23:10] you this this
[1:23:14] story I've heard this over and over and
[1:23:17] over but I did not grab it like I got it
[1:23:21] this
[1:23:23] time and I think if I listen to it again
[1:23:25] I will get it better but listen to this
[1:23:28] brother
[1:23:29] Brandon I have had Sund he talks about
[1:23:33] the story of this of this chaplain I had
[1:23:36] a chaplain friend that was telling
[1:23:39] me of a case in the second world
[1:23:43] now this is the story where he was
[1:23:46] talking about whatever you leave the
[1:23:49] Lord you have to go back that's where
[1:23:51] you will find
[1:23:52] him praise the Lord
[1:23:56] okay that's that's that's where he came
[1:23:58] up with the story talking about whenever
[1:24:00] you left the Lord go back then you will
[1:24:01] find you pick him up from
[1:24:04] there so he tell this um a chaplain
[1:24:07] friend of the second
[1:24:10] world and uh there had been a
[1:24:14] chaplain uh had been machine guned wave
[1:24:19] I guess about 50 caliber machine gun he
[1:24:23] was cut across the chest and he was
[1:24:27] dying and this chaplain was called to
[1:24:29] him they told him to go out to the
[1:24:35] tent and they did just pick him up in
[1:24:40] the hospital in the hospital tent that
[1:24:42] he was dying he couldn't live he he was
[1:24:46] he was already cut through with bullets
[1:24:48] and he couldn't
[1:24:49] live he was bleeding in Waring and so
[1:24:55] the chaplain said he got told the man
[1:24:59] where he was at and he said uh uh he
[1:25:02] said uh
[1:25:04] Captain okay it was a captain that was
[1:25:07] shot a chaplain and a captain is like
[1:25:09] I'm missing the two year he said Captain
[1:25:12] are you a Christian he says I used to
[1:25:15] be and he said you used to
[1:25:18] be why you should be now now that you

[1:25:32] the past you cannot make the past your
[1:25:36] hero faith is now Paul says now Faith is
[1:25:43] now what I was it's
[1:25:46] now he says you should be now because
[1:25:50] you know you are dying he said yes sir I
[1:25:52] know he said now now captain now think
[1:25:56] back with all now you better think fast
[1:26:01] cuz you haven't got much time but you
[1:26:05] you you think back all the way back to
[1:26:08] where you left Christ and right where
[1:26:11] you left him then you start right there
[1:26:14] and begin right there CU you will find
[1:26:17] him right where you left him now you
[1:26:21] might have left
[1:26:22] him on the doctrine of the Bible some uh
[1:26:26] something
[1:26:28] that something that you were told thou
[1:26:31] shall not Ste you walk uh uh right over

[1:26:37] over it and uh uh something another that
[1:26:41] you should not have done yet you walk
[1:26:45] right over it you will have to come
[1:26:48] right straight back and pick it up right
[1:26:52] there again and and so this Captain was
[1:26:55] bleeding in in W and the blood gushing
[1:26:58] out of his lungs and he was he was
[1:27:01] catching his birth fast and and he he
[1:27:04] knew he was going uh uh you better hurry
[1:27:07] the chaplain said you better hurry up
[1:27:09] Captain and he said I just I just don't
[1:27:13] exactly
[1:27:15] remember and after the while a light
[1:27:18] come over his face he said I
[1:27:21] remember I remember right where I left
[1:27:25] him said all right Captain start right
[1:27:30] there he said now I lay me down to
[1:27:35] sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
[1:27:38] and if I should die before I wake I pray
[1:27:43] the Lord my soul to take and he dropped
[1:27:46] over where did he leave Christ at the
[1:27:49] Cradle see at Mother's feet that was the
[1:27:56] thing that struck me as a little
[1:27:59] boy because this thing he
[1:28:02] said it's a bedtime
[1:28:06] prayer that many parents teach their
[1:28:08] children that's
[1:28:12] right you
[1:28:14] see you see uh we we we get we get so
[1:28:18] much caught up in in lot of things that
[1:28:21] sometimes we are far from the reality I
[1:28:24] would tell
[1:28:25] you when when when I when I read this
[1:28:29] man I mean it just there with me the
[1:28:31] whole thing to realize that it is only
[1:28:34] God that can
[1:28:37] reconcile the soul of a
[1:28:40] man it's only
[1:28:43] God praise the Lord your duty is to tell
[1:28:47] people you can't reconcile you can't
[1:28:49] reconcile the soul the way that God
[1:28:51] would take this word I'm saying to you
[1:28:54] tonight and make it real to you I can do
[1:28:57] it I can't do it it's not by me shouting
[1:29:01] or bounding on this thing that is going
[1:29:02] to make it real to you I I scare you to
[1:29:05] death and yet it's not real to you but
[1:29:09] it's only God that can reconcile see
[1:29:12] that man on his dying bed that the Lord
[1:29:16] will take him back many years when he
[1:29:18] was a little boy and on Mama's lap when
[1:29:22] Mama will be praying asking him to pray
[1:29:25] to go to bed he will be making
[1:29:28] fun he never got the reality of
[1:29:31] it he just thought it was a
[1:29:38] religion he never got the reality he
[1:29:41] just thought that it was a
[1:29:48] religion to realize that all of these
[1:29:52] years whether he was was going to church
[1:29:54] I mean he couldn't even tell whether he
[1:29:56] was a Christian or not even on his dying
[1:30:01] bed is because his soul was far from the
[1:30:05] reality your body can dress the message
[1:30:08] but it's your soul that need to be in
[1:30:10] contact with
[1:30:12] God that's what this message was all
[1:30:15] about God sent a a a a prophet to put us
[1:30:18] in contact with
[1:30:21] God David said restore my my
[1:30:30] soul I The
[1:30:32] Creator at Mother's feet see as a little
[1:30:35] boy he had to go all the way back there
[1:30:40] to pick him up I was thinking about this
[1:30:44] and I and I just thought in my mind look
[1:30:46] at the teeth on the
[1:30:48] cross how would Jesus said be you
[1:30:50] tomorrow you will be with me in Paradise
[1:30:54] definitely God found a way to reconcile
[1:30:57] his soul God found a way to take him
[1:31:00] back to the m amen
[1:31:10] amen David to a and and uh H aimc is
[1:31:16] taking Sarah the very woman that's
[1:31:18] supposed to bring the promised
[1:31:20] son and that very night God will come
[1:31:23] down
[1:31:26] now I've always believed in my
[1:31:28] heart that God found a way to reconcile
[1:31:33] David praise the Lord God only comes in
[1:31:36] our defense when he has found a way to
[1:31:39] reconcile
[1:31:41] Us Praise the Lord
[1:31:45] amen message of great brother says God
[1:31:48] David repented he just he said it out of
[1:31:51] inspiration there is nowhere in the
[1:31:52] scripture that tells us that David
[1:31:54] repented but the truth about the matter
[1:31:56] there is that God is the one that
[1:31:59] reconcile our soul God is the one that
[1:32:02] can reconcile mortar there is no mortar
[1:32:05] that is able to reconcile himself with
[1:32:08] God or with another
[1:32:12] mortar there is no mortar that is able
[1:32:15] to reconcile himself With God all with
[1:32:18] another
[1:32:22] Mort I we
[1:32:24] together as said little boy he had to go
[1:32:26] way back there pick him up that's where
[1:32:29] you would pick him where you left him
[1:32:32] and sometimes uh we are leaving him
[1:32:35] right in these simple things we take it
[1:32:38] to be simple we take it just to be
[1:32:41] simple
[1:32:45] things not not not not only our assembly
[1:32:48] is something that is that is global
[1:32:50] around around the message people you
[1:32:53] know like I I took a time here to to
[1:32:55] teach on the church order a little bit
[1:32:58] you know uh that that time that time we
[1:33:01] we uh we we are gravitating to to uh uh
[1:33:05] uh uh laisha Church order then the
[1:33:08] church order that was given to us that
[1:33:11] time you know that uh that uh uh brother
[1:33:15] Bram says you know we we come in and we
[1:33:18] sit and we pray and and you know uh uh
[1:33:22] uh we we try to
[1:33:25] disengage our mind you know relax our
[1:33:28] spirit and all of that prepared our s
[1:33:32] that is the beginning of the service
[1:33:35] it's not when the song service leader
[1:33:36] come up here is the
[1:33:38] beginning that is the beginning of the
[1:33:41] service that's where we begin that's
[1:33:43] where the praying of the service
[1:33:47] begin read read both Church order you
[1:33:50] never find the place where brother
[1:33:51] Brandon talk about opening prayer he
[1:33:53] never said it in the church order why
[1:33:56] because the prayer open when when the
[1:33:59] brother is sitting down you're praying
[1:34:00] when the sister is s but you globally
[1:34:03] it's everywhere around around the world
[1:34:06] that value has gone
[1:34:11] away it has gone
[1:34:22] away and brother says he said if uh if
[1:34:25] uh if pharaoh and his and his men knew
[1:34:29] if they knew they would have taken that
[1:34:32] Ro from Moses
[1:34:34] hands when he dropped it down it turned
[1:34:36] to serpent they were so scared that I
[1:34:39] mean they could only
[1:34:40] impersonate but they could not come near
[1:34:43] if they knew they would have taken it
[1:34:44] and brother B said that's the same thing
[1:34:47] H just like how the rod was in in in in
[1:34:51] Moses hands that is the way the name of
[1:34:53] Jesus Christ is in the church that is
[1:34:56] the way prayer is in the church that is
[1:34:58] the way the word is in the church you
[1:35:01] take it away from the church you just
[1:35:03] have a bunch of gathering
[1:35:06] amen you just have a group of people
[1:35:08] that that belong to something they call
[1:35:10] the
[1:35:13] message that's what he's saying right
[1:35:15] here we took it completely from the
[1:35:17] church now we we we we we plague our
[1:35:21] poor sisters our poor daughter brother
[1:35:23] says you you get three sacrifice what's
[1:35:25] about the church he says I'm saying this
[1:35:28] thing to the church keeping the woman in
[1:35:31] tight she's just a
[1:35:43] type now I'm I'm not angry with you
[1:35:46] don't think I'm angry with you amen I
[1:35:48] talk like this and and uh people say
[1:35:51] well you were really blasting I'm not
[1:35:53] blasting are you I'm just I'm just
[1:35:56] trying to to deal with some Spirits
[1:35:59] amen you just take it like that all the
[1:36:01] time that I'm dealing with some Spirits
[1:36:03] I'm not angry I should I have no reason
[1:36:06] to be angry with you for you to leave
[1:36:08] your home come your Wednesday night and
[1:36:10] I just get mad with you I should be out
[1:36:12] of my mind I should be stupid to do that
[1:36:15] I'm not mad with you I'm just trying to
[1:36:17] call our attention for us to realize
[1:36:21] that we got to go back to the age BCS
[1:36:24] there were things that were so valuable
[1:36:27] to us when we believe the Lord there
[1:36:31] were things that we will not sleep
[1:36:33] over we will not sleep over we will not
[1:36:37] sleep over it but now it does not matter
[1:36:40] to
[1:36:42] us we sleep over and you know and uh you
[1:36:46] know have a little talk you know with
[1:36:48] our wife go to the other place and I
[1:36:50] mean how how are we keeping Christ then
[1:36:53] that's right how are we keeping
[1:36:58] Christ we give reason why we must not do
[1:37:02] what the word says we always find a
[1:37:09] reason we always find a reason to bring
[1:37:13] in a little bit of
[1:37:15] Wess we always find a reason and that is
[1:37:19] the thing that is making the church
[1:37:21] powerless that's right because you have
[1:37:23] to realize that there are spirits
[1:37:27] involved this is a spiritual
[1:37:30] warfare and when the people are not
[1:37:32] praying and not concentrating themselves
[1:37:35] you have more demon powers creeping on
[1:37:38] our shoulders and we come struggling and
[1:37:41] struggling and hallelujah praise the
[1:37:43] Lord and and I mean we can't even break
[1:37:45] through just like the preacher should
[1:37:47] break through when he's preaching you
[1:37:49] also have to break through when the
[1:37:51] preacher is preaching you have to be
[1:37:53] connected to the word you come for your
[1:37:56] soul to be fed it's not to come and
[1:37:59] watch somebody performing on a
[1:38:08] pit but I'm just here to encourage you
[1:38:11] tonight and says wasted water cannot be
[1:38:15] gathered when you waste time you waste
[1:38:19] these precious
[1:38:21] things praise the Lord
[1:38:24] I mean if people have to be to work and
[1:38:26] other things is that's good but if you
[1:38:28] don't have to be to work you just take
[1:38:30] the pleasure and enjoyment to sit home
[1:38:32] and and follow service online well I
[1:38:34] mean uh uh you have to you it have to be
[1:38:37] for some important reason the reason why
[1:38:39] I'm saying that is
[1:38:42] because
[1:38:44] uh one is because it's the truth praise
[1:38:48] the Lord and two is because
[1:38:54] brother brandom said in the spoken word
[1:38:57] is the Original
[1:38:59] Seed he said life comes through the
[1:39:03] body praise the
[1:39:05] Lord life comes through the
[1:39:08] body when when when when when the when
[1:39:11] the when the when a child is
[1:39:14] conceived it's a life but it it builds
[1:39:18] that there have to be a body to sustain
[1:39:21] that life
[1:39:24] there has to be a body to sustain that
[1:39:27] life now if if for some reason the body
[1:39:33] is uh is is is paralyzed or is uh uh
[1:39:38] handicapped you will realize that it's
[1:39:40] going to
[1:39:42] struggle praise the lord it's going to
[1:39:45] struggle the church must not only rest
[1:39:48] on the musicians it must not only rest
[1:39:51] on the preacher
[1:39:53] we all makes the
[1:39:55] body we all makes the
[1:40:02] body I never one time believe in my mind
[1:40:04] that if I'm not in church there will not
[1:40:06] be a good service I never one time
[1:40:09] believe that I must never think that in
[1:40:10] my head I know it's my responsibility
[1:40:13] but I don't I don't put it in my head
[1:40:15] I'm not the one that make the
[1:40:19] service he promised that wheresoever two
[1:40:22] or three I gather in my name I will be
[1:40:26] there that's what he said and that's
[1:40:28] what we
[1:40:34] believe but again I'm saying it in this
[1:40:38] way just to encourage you you
[1:40:42] know uh uh precious
[1:40:49] things I mean every one of us we can go
[1:40:52] back every one of us us because every
[1:40:55] every son or daughter that is birthed by
[1:40:59] God there is a special
[1:41:02] moment in our
[1:41:05] lives I mean if you have not had that
[1:41:08] yet you got to check your
[1:41:14] birth and it is those things when the
[1:41:17] when they when when the enemy can take
[1:41:19] away sometimes it's hard to get it
[1:41:23] it's hard to get it that's right because
[1:41:26] it is not something that you can
[1:41:29] purchase it's not something that you can
[1:41:31] work yourself up to get no you got those
[1:41:35] things because the grace of God rewarded
[1:41:37] you with
[1:41:39] it that's how you got
[1:41:41] it and when it go sometimes it's hard
[1:41:45] for you to get
[1:41:46] it it's
[1:41:50] hard if I if I want to be honest with
[1:41:52] you I can even I tell of my own
[1:41:55] self you know there there are there are
[1:41:58] there are things that uh I think I lost
[1:42:02] spiritually and I want to get back to
[1:42:04] that
[1:42:10] place I mean the the the hour is so is
[1:42:13] so close the hour is so deceiving the
[1:42:16] hour is so you know there's so much
[1:42:19] pressure
[1:42:27] and I just trying to encourage
[1:42:31] you waste of time cannot be G get
[1:42:35] anymore waste the money you can't get it
[1:42:39] back so anything wasted is hard to
[1:42:45] get praise the Lord she told
[1:42:48] David all you doing is waste the water
[1:42:52] you can't gather it
[1:42:57] you can't gather waste of
[1:42:59] water what has happened has happened
[1:43:03] Paul says leaving those things in the
[1:43:05] past let's press onto the mark of the
[1:43:08] high calling the thing that is difficult
[1:43:11] for us is
[1:43:13] leaving no we we don't he said leaving
[1:43:16] we don't do leaving we do
[1:43:19] dragging instead of leaving we put it on
[1:43:21] our shoulder and we drag it
[1:43:29] as soon as we go through little things
[1:43:32] we go start Gathering everything from
[1:43:34] the past it it because I did this it it
[1:43:37] because you mean that the blood the the
[1:43:40] the sea of forgetfulness is so low that
[1:43:43] you able to put your hand there and pick
[1:43:44] up
[1:43:46] things what kind of see what kind of see
[1:43:49] is
[1:43:50] that I think we get bathed up not SE
[1:43:53] forgetfulness we get some of we just get
[1:43:56] little sink we confess our sins in
[1:43:58] little sink that we can just go and pick
[1:44:01] it up
[1:44:06] back because if you are putting it in a
[1:44:16] seed and the devil use all of these
[1:44:18] things to Rob us put us under pressure
[1:44:22] keep us under fear here yes
[1:44:27] yes when the joy of the
[1:44:30] Lord is our strength the Lord bless you
[1:44:34] tonight musicians you can come

[1:50:27] name three things that she must not get
[1:50:31] away from now keep the church in mind
[1:50:35] what I'm speaking this to the Natural
[1:50:38] Woman as Paul is here in the seventh
[1:50:41] chapter of Roman she has a sacri trust
[1:50:46] of virtue committed to
[1:50:49] her by her Lord she has a SA
[1:50:54] what a responsibility it is to a woman
[1:50:57] to a church to the
[1:51:00] bride now see why she is a type of the
[1:51:04] church which is which has the same
[1:51:08] responsibility as a woman has a sacred
[1:51:12] responsibility to her motherhood to her
[1:51:14] virtue to her husband the church has a
[1:51:19] sacr responsibility to prayer
[1:51:24] to the word read your Bible and
[1:51:29] pray don't survive on the the the quot
