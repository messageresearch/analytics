for some reason uh as in since last year or two years ago now I've just I've just been caught up in this place where I started tracking events around the message it's been I've been becoming very very conscious to it today it is uh uh February 28th so uh we know that uh uh the angel of the Lord visit in Arizona and uh so I want to I want to talk a little little bit on there tonight I will continue on Sunday but I want to just talk a little bit on there tonight praise to Lord let's just read the scripture and then we have our seat and then we see how we can be able to make the best of the service tonight praise the Lord uh like I said in while praying brother elij is there preaching for brother Brooks tonight so uh uh he will be back and then Sunday he will be with brother Joel Pasco in uh Wisconsin praise the Lord and uh uh we I'm sure we we we appreciate we appreciate our brother and uh uh he had a good service uh preaching for us on the weekend so uh let's turn to Acts chapter one Acts chapter one Acts chapter one the Lord is very gracious and he's uh the way he does his things is a kind of for surprise us amen but I pray that the Lord will be able to to help us as he have as he always does tonight we just want to bring a little talk to you and then uh uh uh on Sunday we will continue in their light praise the Lord I actually thought I will be in Arizona this uh this week for brother Doug Bob meeting and then I will preach for brother Ezra Paul but then uh some few things came up I just thought that okay uh maybe I'm not supposed to be there this time so uh that's why we are home and uh let's read from verse six let's read from verse 6 verse 6 of Acts chapter one and when sorry when they therefore were come together the they ask of him asking Jesus Jesus and his disciple saying Lord will there at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel and and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the season which the father have put in his own power praise the Lord even though the the fullness of God was in Christ but yet there were things that the father held back from him praise the Lord when uh uh uh when the mother of uh uh James and John were asking to sit on his right hand and his left hand he said no it is not for me to give the father have not reveiled that to me praise the Lord so Jesus is is saying here you know uh it is it is now for you to know the time and the season which the father have put in his own power now that is the reason why Revelation 1 verse one says there are the Revelation uh of Jesus that God gave to him so Jesus in the continuation of his ministry will now receive the full revelation of all things that will be revealed right there in the Book of Revelation let's read verse 8 but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth and when he have spoken these things why they beh held he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight I wish I was there yes sir praise the Lord but I'm glad that I'm here amen yes sir and while they look steadfastly towards heaven as he went up behold two men sto by them in white aaral which also said ye men of G was stand ye gazing up into heaven the same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven praise the Lord amen amen now is very is very amazing I don't think uh I didn't write the Bible neither did I think brother brandham wrote this Bible but whoever wrote this Bible put right under this verse that we have just read verse 11 they put Daniel chapter 7:3 that's where we'll be studying tonight so let's just bow our heads and pray Heavenly Father we just want to thank you we are humbling our heart before you Lord few things we want to share there are uh morning events that are made clear by prophecy God I pray that Lord you would just envelope Us in tonight in your word precious Lord It's all about your word it's all about you it's all about what you have done and what you are doing oh God I pray give Grace Lord father it's a a subject that is we don't have enough time to be able to go by the time that is allotted to us may we do the best that we can to be able to say something that will draw us closer to you in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat while we turn to Danel chapter 7 why you turn into Daniel chapter 7 and like I said uh uh many many of the Believers since around the world H are com commemorating uh uh uh February 28th that is that is very familiar to us until uh uh lately or some period of time uh uh February 28 came on a big attack there is there is there is no even around the message that is under so much of attack there in February 28th praise the Lord and uh and for me personally as long as I remain your pastor of this church until you vote me after the service vote me out after the service but praise the Lord amen that was one of the thing that inspired me to make that picture out there sir that I put out there right over the water fountain and uh I'll tell you more about that on on uh Sunday from my own personal inspiration and uh uh uh so so uh we know that uh February 28 uh uh before February 28 uh brother Brandon preached the message s is this the time and he explained to the church you know told the church about uh multiple visions that he had and other believers in the church brothers sisters that were coming to him with different Vision about going to the worst you know and and uh uh seven Vision in line I wish we had time to look at all of those seven Visions together but uh uh and it was all preparing for this great experience that was going to take place on that day where the uh uh uh seven angels came down you know uh uh giving brother brandham you know uh uh an instruction to return back to Jeffersonville for the opening of the seals and and what a tremendous experience it was many many turn to believe that there was a an explosion from an airlane praise the Lord amen it make it more mysterious for us amen praise the lord it's easy to believe that God did that than to believe that Aeroplane did that because if you believe that God because God can do everything amen he can do everything and anything so it's it's it's much easier to believe that uh it was God then to believe that that is Aeroplane because uh uh the the the the height of the Mist that sustained in the heavens and move all around and uh uh so uh um it was actually from this live magazine uh this is actually the May 17 the actual magazine that first published the the the the pictures you know first published it and called it mysterious Cloud uh uh uh back there in 1963 at that time they were selling it 25 cents I bought it more than 25 cents praise the Lord and uh uh so uh uh this is the actual magazine that the that uh that published that and the brother bought the magazine and show it to brother Brandon so the picture that we have out there actually took everything right from you and uh uh to to be able to print it and make it big down there and just like I said I have my own my own reason for doing it praise the Lord because you see just like brother Brandon had three pools I believe that uh this pH of the message is the bride part of the message amen praise the Lord and uh and when we talk about the opening of the word it was it was Christ himself yes amen that came down and opened his word brother brandham had nothing to do with it you know he was just the man that was there but it was God that that came down and opened his word so you see the the beauty of this message is the Fulfillment of scripture that's the beauty of this message if you don't love your Bible you will not enjoy his message you might ride on uh you know the uh uh you know the dos and done that would be just for a while it will not last praise the Lord because the message go more beyond the dos and done is the very Life of Christ praise the Lord is the token Life of Christ so uh uh so I thought tonight that I will speak not majorly but I I I I want to bring a connection here and uh and that's what I want to talk about but before I do that let me read few few quotes to you the greatest new Flash in history let's let's just read that one and see what uh what brother Brandon said yeah he said the greatest new Flash in history praise the Lord he said so so it was a great time them glorious 40 days what is he talking about after Jesus resurrected he was here after he resurrected he never ascended immediately he was here with the disciples walking through the city of Jerusalem for 40 days and in and in that period of time he was he was going through the walls because the Bible says the disciple were in the place the door was closed and the Lord came through God Amen when he walked with the two men on the road of EMAs he broke the bread their eyes came open and the Lord left so 40 days he was here on Earth that's what that's what he's referring to here and that's what the scripture taught us so so it was a great time then 40 days how I will have loved to have been there praise the Lord seeing Abraham and Sarah walking through the streets because the Bible says the Old Testament sins resurrected sir this is not a feeble it's in the Bible that's what the Bible says amen Matthew chapter 27 you just go and read all down there you will see it this it's right there it's written in the scripture now as I was as I was thinking about this this morning this is this is the thing that is that that really caught my mind this morning 4:00 a.m. I woke up I came downstairs and and I was just thinking about February 28 that's why we sang that song Lord I want Lord I Thank thee praise the Lord and what I was going through my mind I was saying uh uh uh never lived through the time to see the uh uh brother Brandon and uh uh or to see some of the things that happen there on sunet mountain we've been uh reading the generation uh series of uh home for our devotion and uh uh and we're reading the testimony of uh brother Evans and he was testifying brother Brandon marish and D there that he's how how you know they were at The Filling Station brother Brandon mentioned that on tape and they saw the cloud going up and down and and and there were people that that you know that witnessed these things just like there were people we have just read in the Bible the Bible says while they were beholding they saw Jesus caught up in a cloud it was not a feeble people just like you and myself saw it Genesis Chapter 18 it's not just a story that Moses wrote Abraham saw three men coming to him praise the Lord it's not just a feble are we together now so he said how I would have loved to have been there but then thinking again that I did have I did have heart to be a believer because he did not appear to no one but his elected church so even if you were in the days of Jesus just like if you are living today if God didn't call you to believe that the Messiah was on Earth you will have lived your life and you will have known nothing about him it wouldn't have been your choice for you to follow Jesus Jesus called his disciples come follow me Matthew follow thou me so even if you were living in the days of Jesus if he did not call you you wouldn't have followed him are we together am but then thinking again that I they have had to be a believer because he did not appear to no one but his elected church he he only appeared to Believers and as he was then he cannot change to he cannot change today he still only appear to his elected Church Believers praise the Lord now we find that there were there were many who taught of maiah in those days and there were many who look for the coming Mah but he had a church that was elected so has he tonight praise the Lord I was looking on on Google this afternoon I was looking on Google for for what is commemorated today so all sorts of things today is pink day today is I mean all sorts of things they were commemorated chocolate day I saw today is worldwide chocolate day praise the Lord and you you know it's it it sounds a little bit funny but uh uh I remember when I was printing this I was doing it at at Michaels put trying to put in frame the one we have back there so the lady asked me what is this picture she look at the picture she says she says she says what is this it looked mysterious I said that's what it is you are seeing it you know a rink of mystery you know she says I've never seen this in my life but it just looked like you're just looking at it you know it it it draws your attention you know and then I started telling her a little bit about it but uh don't want to spend all the Wednesday night tonight let's just read another thought on the same uh Direction here uh invisible Union of the bride of Christ I set in it who have loved to have been here during the time of his visit on the earth during Jesus time of his physical visit on the Earth but still I think this right now is a greater time praise the Lord why makes it a greater time because even if if we were here at the time Jesus was here many of the things that he said never fulfilled at the time he was here praise the Lord many of the things that he said H H Matthew chapter 24 he was there he was telling them how how uh this c will be in Cal you know uh uh uh you know and and then how uh there will be desolation there will be farming and and people will eat their own children he was saying it never happened at the time he was there he ascended couple of years later before the the Roman generous Titus and come about so you see living in the time that he was making the prophecy is not more is not more a blessing than living in the time where the prophecy is fulfilled right praise the Lord amen living in the time where the prophecy is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled amen are we together amen so I I would have loved to have been during the time he visited the Earth but still I think this right now is a greater time because it's a time that he's coming to take the people that he redeemed nearing the resurrection when all the redeemed will come forth what a glorious opportunity we have to speak to a dying people a great time we are entrusted about it now so uh uh uh uh just like I said I would have loved to have been in the time that this uh uh uh mystery Cloud was taking in all of that but I'm glad to be here I'm glad to be in this time uh to be able to to see it praise the Lord to realize that the millions around the world and and not not only around the world but even to realize realiz there are many that are sitting even in message churches and don't really understand uh what what this was all about that's that that is the big confusion praise the Lord amen the day that Jesus died that day there were more scriptures that were fulfilled about Jesus then all of the time of his ministry the day that he died there were more scriptures in the Old Testament that were fulfilled about him right from Genesis coming down to Malachi are we together so let's go to uh uh uh Daniel chapter 7 tonight like I said we will speak uh a little more on uh on this on Sunday if God G give us the the the grace amen praise the Lord we'll speak uh a little more on uh on uh on the cloud are we together now Daniel chapter 7 in Daniel chapter 7 tonight what actually we talking about is Asian of day because it's the only chapter in the Bible where that title of God was used Asian of day it was used three times in Daniel chapter 7 and it was used under it was used under uh H H A peculiar circumstances it was used under a peculiar Vision that Daniel had praise the Lord So Daniel chapter 7 let's look at verse 9 Daniel chapter 7 let's look at verse 9 and I beheld till the trones were cast down I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Asian of days they s his Gard men was white as snow and the head of his head like a pure World his throne was like a a fair flame and his wheels as burning fire praise the Lord that's one of the verse we will go into more details on Sunday just want to pick up the three verses verse 13 is the second time asan of De was used like I said or Through the Bible the only time this title of uh of Elohim or the only time the title of God Asian of day was used was right in this chapter verse 13 I saw in the N vision and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Asian of days now for a long time I was confused on this verse praise the Lord why because these are two titles these are two titles of God he's called the son of man amen he's called the Asian of day this were two titles of God merging blending praise the Lord and recently H uh uh brother Elijah that preached for us his younger brother is over in Philadelphia Samuel you know we he he we talk all the time he will will talk about scriptural things so I fell on the Old Mill I don't remember uh that should be back uh uh uh even before I came to the state so they should be around uh ear 2,000 that I sent to brother Loney Jenkins on this very scripture praise the Lord so I wrote him I I said I said brother Lon uh uh because we we he was a good friend of mine we always uh you know uh share scriptures you know we would talk and and uh so I sent I sent him a mail that I saw the mail recently so I I sent him a mail and I asked him I say I say for why I been I've been in trouble on this uh because there there are two titles of Our Lord in this verse and uh how do we now the thing about it there in the in in the back part of my mind even as a young uh uh uh uh as a young preacher a young believer in the back part of my mind it's it it could be very easy for me to associate it with uh with the cloud could be very easy for me to associate with the cloud but I did not know how to explain it in my mind I've always always told myself if there is one scripture Biblical scripture that explain February 28th is this scripture praise the Lord we'll see a little we'll see a little more on that uh uh on uh uh on Sunday praise the Lord amen on Sunday we will go go go into into some some details since we don't we don't have all the time tonight uh praise the Lord I lost my place here okay now so verse 13 again um I saw in a night vision and behold one like the son of man came with clouds of heaven and came to the asan of day and they brought him di before him amen and and there was given him dominion and glory and Kingdom that all people Nation language should serve him now so you see this whole Daniel chapter 7 when you look at the three times the Asian of day was used it went it went before the time uh uh uh of of of the Millennium praise the Lord it goes into the Millennium and it goes after the Millennium now you you really have to be able to to uh to you know to look at the verses and really be able to place it in their time sequence because many of the time just like in your dreams when you dream Dre sometimes is not really in sequence as you think it is praise the Lord that's the reason why sometimes in your dream you think like Oh I thought I was I thought it was in the morning praise the Lord I thought in my dream I thought it was in the afternoon but I was in my night gown so I got a little bit confused because I thought the sun was up but I it looks like I will stay in my in my night gowns so was it in the night was it in the morning because it's sometimes it's not really in the time sequence as we as you look at it and there are two scriptures two books in the Bible that are like that the Book of Revelation as you see the chapter going is not really in the chapter is not in sequence like the way the events are happening praise the Lord am amen when we were uh uh playing the beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation I spoke on both the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation just bringing some bden pieces of how the the the are similarity they H they hold the mystery The Book of Daniel hold the mystery to the Jewish Redemption and the Book of Revelation hold the mystery to the Gentile Church Redemption praise the Lord and that's the reason why many people get confused reading the book of Revelation because they think they are following the sequence of events but it looks like when they get to a certain place it looks like well I thought this was supposed to happen before this and that is the very same thing that is taking place right here in the book of uh in the Book of Daniel if you read from verse one in in in chapter 7 you will realize Daniel is talking about all of these all of these beasts all of these these uh uh uh mysterial beasts that that you know that type the the the Gentile Kingdom all of these Beast he talking about them and then right in the midst of that then he brings in this character called the Asian of day praise the Lord and and and when you look at the sequence of things that is happening here the asan of De is is uh is uh is an attribute is a is uh identification of God that is associated with end time judgment praise the Lord amen that is associated with end time judgment because when you look at uh uh let me let me just let me just uh read something here just to be able to to uh uh get on our mind a little bit uh when we go back to verse 9 I beheld till the truns were cast down now now uh uh in in in in in one in one place brother brandom interpreted this as the the the the Thrones the the the the powers of the word coming to their end praise the Lord because before Jesus would come and ruled Every Nation must come to its End Amen so beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Asian of day did sit then his Throne was now erected when all other Thrones were cast down now so when when when you look at that whose garment was what I snowed his head uh uh uh like uh pure world and the throne was like a fair flame and the wheel was burning and the fairy stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands Minister unto him and and and 10,000 time 10,000 stood before him and joshman was set and the books were open so you see that is the only time isan of day was ever talked about it's related to judgment it's related to end time judgment from from the time where uh uh uh God WRA will Begin to Fall gradually from the be from the time where the wrath of God will Begin to Fall gradually I mean you don't need any kind of a vision or more uh H uh uh you know uh spiritual insight for you to realize that the word is under the wrath of God with all of the things that are happening but it had a beginning time which go back to Revelation 10 when that angel begin to sign time shall be no more time shall be no more so right from that time right from that time onto the white room judgment is a period of time that that manifestation of God there asan of day praise the Lord amen the one who existed before days that's what Asian of day means he existed before time he's Before Time and before days now let's follow me in a little bit here and uh and and and uh the books were said he says uh verse 11 I beheld then because of the voice of the of the great words which the horns speak I beheld even till the Beast was slain and his body destroyed and and giving to the Burning Flame now so you see you go back to the Book of Revelation then you understand the horns he's talking about you understand the Beast that were destroyed you understand where his body was burned all of that is all part of the Judgment praise the lord it's all part of the Judgment that's where now you will understand and uh uh when brother Bram started talking about what took place on February 28th he associated with the supreme authority the Supreme Jorge he said they always wear that week amen right here Daniel is saying His Garment in verse 9 what I snow his head uh uh uh uh uh uh and the head of his head was as pure wall you go back to Revelation chapter one that is the same way Jesus was identified in the midst of the seven golden candles stick are we together amen now you see because the way the church word presented judgment they presented judgment uh uh with a scene of total chaos and destruction that that that is the end of all of of of everything but as you look through the scripture you will realize that uh even you go back and read The Book of Ezekiel you go back and read the history of Israel you realize that when God was bringing judgment on his people he brings it you know he brings he brings he brings events that serve as warning to the people amen there will be earthquakes the moon will turn to blood and all of that all of those are serving as signs of warning end time judgment are we together okay I'm just just trying to run through that we'll preach on Sunday if the Lord T you now so verse 11 verse 12 said as concerning the rest of the Beast they have their dominions taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a for a season in time now verse 13 now brings us to this place where the son of man is he came to the asan of day and they brought him they brought him near before him now the third time Asian of day was used in uh in in in this chapter in the Bible will be uh uh in verse 22 in verse 22 now if you go back and read verse 21 before you come to 22 uh let's read from verse 20 and of the 10 horns that were in his head revelation will tell what the 10 horn is and of the other which came and and and before whom three fell even of that horn that that her eyes and the mouth that speak very great things whose look was more sh then his fellow that's that mysterious beaste that took the combination of the three amen men I beheld and the same horn make war with the Saints and Prevail against them until the Asian of day Asian of days came and judgment was given to the Saints of the most high praise the Lord the sin shall Jud the word so all of that so I'm just trying to set a scene here so you you can see what was happening now now you will see now when you go back to S uh uh uh is this the time in brother Bram talking where he says uh you know uh uh judgment is set for the West Coast he said I threw the dust in the air and there was an explosion all of those things were setting the scene for end time judgment are we together amen are you seeing the picture I read something to you here before I I close there's uh there's a lot we could look at together but uh I'm just trying to set the scene here and uh and it was it was uh uh today 61 years now since that experience on February 28 1963 you can just see how far we have come yes sir that will tell you why the word is becoming what it is it will tell you why we having all the shooting all the killing it will tell you not one nation is spell now one nation because all kiddom will have to fall praise the Lord are we together I hope you know that this is not to scare you this is just to let you know what time we are in because it's the time that we are in praise the Lord Lord amen this is is to remind you it's not to scare you the things on the news if they don't scare you they should not scare you that's right this this is just to remind you what what we we we are under a time of God's raft the day of the Lord when the Bible talks about the day of the Lord it was a day of judgment praise the lord it's just like when God was bringing his judgment on on on Egypt he never took he never took uh the Hebrews out of the land before the Judgment start falling the Hebrews were there when the 10 plag were falling they were there when all the firstborn uh uh died they could hear the crying and yelling every word but you see what God did he gathered his elected people in a in a in a special place called Gan sir while there were Darkness every word he was the light that Pillar of Fire was right there in Egypt providing life for the people to lead them out of Egypt and if we are in a time of an exitor that is the very same thing that we are Darkness all around now the light we have in Gan is God's promised word for this hour praise the lord it's God's promised word for this hour if you if you have another option to get out of the chaos of this word you better grab it what I know that is the light to take us out of the darkness of this world is the message of the hour if you know another option grab it and and and and and get and and get yourself out if you can because the only future that this word have is the coming of the Lord is the rapture of the church we don't have another government we don't have another polit h h a party that is going to change change the the the word system it's all crumbling Daniel said I beheld in the night visions the Thrones were all falling amen praise the Lord the trones were cast down that's what he said in the night vision now so we see all of these this by by God's grace Sunday we tried to we tried I was I was trying to to run it through Revelation and and Daniel to see how we can be able to throw some light and and and put some things in perspective but the actual thing there is there it will take you you know you really need a good teacher they mean to really put things in in uh in uh in in their prophecy uh prophetic perspective because the sequence is is backing forth we'll do the best that we can amen praise the Lord uh the the the purpose is not to teach a bible school because I'm not giving certificate the purpose is just to for you to be for us to be able to see the time that we are in for us to prepare ourself to get out of Year Praise the Lord if you want a one-on-one Bible class then we can do that one praise the Lord now let's take one verse here on on part M vision and and I I will close tonight I will close tonight I really really couldn't find a better way to bring this out but the most important thing that uh that cut my my heart is uh I'm glad to to know that uh God visit our generation praise the Lord amen I'm glad to know he have given us what to use to prepare ourself yes to get out of here let's read that on on on pmo Vision all right now Dan near 79 and I beheld until the Thrones were cast down and the asent of day did s whose G Men was white as snow and the head of his head was like pure w asan of days his throne was like a fair flame and his whe were burning fire a fair stream issu and came forth from before him and thousands thousands Minister unto him and 10 and and and and 10 uh thousands stood before him and Josh men was set and the books were open white head now wash now see bam trying to bring some sense of interpretation to us whad or or anybody know there the old J judges in Asian days like English judges used to wear a snow white week how many remember that all Asian judges wor a white week and here he is showing again that joins over in the Lord's day amen he saw him as as the Jorge amen not a priest not as king not as Prophet but as judge the fathers in John 522 commit all judgment to him praise the Lord amen are we together and and his judge now come to judge the Nations oh for that day when you see him like there his his head was as white as snow Daniel saw him coming to the Asian of day amen Daniel saw him coming to the a of day now watch the next statement watch him blend these two together blending the son of man ministrate and the Asian of day blending the two together watch him blending the two together this this actually really help me understand uh uh uh uh uh that that part of the scripture there amen that in the Fulfillment of this prophecy it were two Ministry that was Blended together amen it were two Ministry that was Blended together like if you take uh uh there in the church his boy brother Bram says uh according to Malachi 4 H uh uh he will he will turn the heart of the children back to the fathers and according to revelation 10:7 he will reveal the mystery of the seals praise the Lord but it will take this Divine mystery truth to literally that's right praise the Lord amen so you seeing there uh uh two two two separate prophecy being fulfilled on one Ministry to be able to achieve the purpose of turning our heart back to the fathers the Lord are we together amen so there is a there is there is a blending year of the son of man coming to the Asian of day we will look up more of that on Sunday if if the Lord help us I've seen another another direction to go into but uh uh we we just trust the Lord you pray for me and watch him blend these two together all right come to the Asian of days who head was white as snow and John turned and he saw one like the son of man praise the Lord amen he saw one like the Son of Man Standing in the midst of the seven golden candles stick with a snow white head the George not not gather around the waist but gather over the pipes up here at George praise the Lord right amen and then you go up go about and talks about the supreme authority and that place of the supreme authority is where now Christ is holding every one of us every nation everything created he's holding them accountable to his word yes sir we are not giving account to Nations we are giving account to him because he created all for his purpose we're going to give account to him we are accountable to the one that brought us here praise the Lord amen well now Jesus he created a resting place for us there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ they have passed from Death onto life amen so we we Face our judgment for our past present and future sins we Face their judgment by our attitude to the word every time we read the word every time we hear the word what we do with faith praise the Lord because that that is the place of the Asian of day the one W was before everything and that is the that is the subject we've been talking about in the beginning was the word that's the asan of day the asan of day is the word that's the reason why in his manifestation he's holding every nation under his word he said what I what did you do with my word in your nation in your home in your state he's holding Every Nation every Throne every Power is now giving account to the word are we together so you see when brother brandham said that when the the seals were open the Bible became a new book it was not just a slogan no the truth of God was revealed to bring us to life amen amen it was to bring us to life it was to bring us to the place of of uh of of recation and an identity where we can look right into the word to be able to pass from Death onto life Peter said judgment begin in the house of God and if God will scarcely if the righteous will be scarcely saved as they come through their judgment as God examined our life by the word praise the Lord amen let me let me say something and uh uh you know I was sitting there on Sunday sitting right here and brother Elijah was preaching just like I said I heard him on the phone in the morning and he was he was uh you know uh uh he was uh talking you know dealing with something back home and I was wondering what was what was going on so and I realized that he was talking to to some folks I think they they had a family you know dealing with a family in his church and and all of that but we didn't talk about it on our way to church but for some reason I I I could just see that he was you know he was tense he was nervous because he's coming to preach and Y say he he have already you have already been tuned up and just to see how the Holy Spirit led him praise praise the Lord and then he just he just dwell on family family family family I was sitting right there I was saying oh God I was just saying oh God how you know our needs praise the Lord I said oh God how you know our need you for me I I don't care what people would think because if you know me I'm not I'm not I'm not a I'm not one that hire them I'm not I don't hire preachers to come and preach for me that's right hire them and tell them what to preach I don't do that that's right if you know me I don't do that so I don't care what you think my conscience is right before God but but the thing about it there is there uh even as an assembly I see for a while how the enemy started attacking our homes yes praise the Lord amen different families and different things been going on and and all of that and and uh uh um but I was sitting right there and I was just saying oh God thank you for your word whatever you are doing do it quickly whatever you are doing you know I I was just I was just hearing in my in in my subconscious help is on the way I say glory be to God I was just hearing help is on the way amen I say oh Lord thank you help is on the way praise the Lord but that's the place where we are that's the time that we are living in you know we can we can we can we can go and talk about the cloud and and get into the argument brother Brandon was there brother Brandon was not there it does not to me to me that's not an argument for me that's right what is important to me is that a scripture being fulfilled I can bring that even to a scripture praise the Lord amen it just happened to be William Brams whose Ministry fall in line with the that if it if it was not and God choose Joseph Brown Joseph Brown will be the one who will be cting whoever Joseph Brown is so my my my part of it I'm I'm not in the argument because to me what this message is is the Fulfillment of scripture praise the lord it's the Fulfillment of scripture what what has been said about this age what God has promised about this age he promised that he will get a bride and that scripture is fulfilled amen amen praise the Lord he promised there will be a manifestation of the sons of God and that scripture is fulfilled amen and you watch in Jesus ministry what was he doing to the disciples he was spending much of the time reminding them what is written in the psalm in you have heard that it is written but now I say unto you praise the Lord he was trying to say we are in a time where the Old Testament scripture is fulfilled that's the reason why St John Chapter 2 when he when he Whi and turned the table over the Bible says the disciples they were looking at one another and it came to their mind what is written in the psalm the Zeal of the house has eaten Me Up When God moved in every generation when God moved when God moved in the time of Luther by putting the the the the Tes on the wall it was a fulfillment of scripture yes sir God don't move to the church God don't move to start a denomination God move to fulfill his word and whenever God moving in your life is to bring his word to pass because you are a son of God you are a daughter of God he's moving to to raise you up because when the enemy come as a Flor he raise up a standard you cannot raise the standard he raised the standard because his word is the standard that the devil that is above every other standard are we together just like how it was in Egypt judgment were falling plagues for falling amen can you think about that I'll say this in our close just just think about this now God gave Egypt 10 PL when he brought his people out he gave them Ten Commandments and the Ten Commandment was his word amen the plagues were falling the Judgment water turning into blood frogs all over the place sicknesses power breaking up all over their body but yet God people were preparing to go into the land of the promise are we together amen let's bow our heads musician you can come pray for me as I do for you and we trust that the Lord will bless us [Music] together let's bow our
