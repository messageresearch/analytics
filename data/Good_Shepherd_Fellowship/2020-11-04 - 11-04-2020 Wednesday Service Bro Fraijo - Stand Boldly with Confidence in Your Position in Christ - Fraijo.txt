hallelujah foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] hey man we believe he abides with us this evening here we know that he's here in our midst where he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i will be and we are here i can see more than two or three so we can be of one thing assured and that he is here with us if no one else is here if maybe your your friend's not here your family's not here you can be sure of one thing he is here and he's come to meet your need where you stand musicians go ahead and take a seat now we'll just jump right into the message here if you turn with me to the book of ephesians 6 and we're going to read let's see here it's actually i gave them a different set of verses but let's start at verse 12 and we're just going to read through here it's going to be a little bit long but bear with me all right if you're there to say amen all right it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak you may be seated if you would just turn with me also to philippians chapter 1 verse 14. it's got two little verses here and philippians 1 verse 14 and it says and many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear then with just one verse you can turn with if you'd like if not it's just real short here proverbs 28 verse 1. and it says the wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion let's just go before the lord heavenly father lord we just come before you once again this evening just thanking you for this opportunity to be here gathered in the presence of saints of like faith father knowing that lord just to have the opportunity to be gathered with people of such caliber father is a blessing in itself knowing that we could come and draw strength from one another knowing that each one would bring their lick of fire and that presence of god into this room father lord spiritually speaking there's already an inferno in this place father lord people have come after long days of being at work and school and lord just trudging through this world and father with the attacks of the devil and father we just are here looking to hear from you father lord to find a moment of reprieve a moment of peace father where all the clouds of the world and the storms of this life would be cleared away and we could just see through to the prize ahead father so we just surrender this evening to you ask that you'd come and take full control of this service lord that you would just use me to lord this voice that you would use it to speak to your people words of life something that would be a benefit to them i would just dedicate it all to you in jesus name amen i actually want to take my text or my title whatever you'd like to call it out of that you see in in these scriptures i read there's a little bit of a um parallel that i want to take and that is maybe for our text i want to take stand boldly with confidence in your position in christ um now in ephesians 6 there when we read i read the whole thing i just thought that first few verses were gave us a lot of context to maybe feed off of giving us instructions on how to move forward with standing boldly but i want to focus in on paul you know paul here he's writing to the ephesians and he's got to a place in his life where he's been imprisoned in rome he's he's at the end of his ministry and if there was anyone who had stood boldly for the word and for the message of jesus christ you would think it would be paul the apostle with all the things he had been through leading up to that beaten shipwrecked he had died and been brought back to life stoned to death with all these things he would think man if anyone has the courage and boldness to stand up it would have to be paul and yet paul even in this position he's reaching out to them and he's saying pray for me pray for me that i may open my mouth boldly now it's important to now take what he states the reason why he's going to be opening his mouth boldly because we could run with anything boldly and you could just become a complete fool right but he says to make known the mystery of the gospel see it has a focus it has a purpose and on down he says for which i am an ambassador in bonds now i thought about that for a moment and most people think well he's talking about his imprisonment in rome but you see i don't think so when he says i'm an ambassador in bonds we know he said he was a prisoner of love to the gospel of jesus christ you see because he'd been imprisoned before many places and that had never held him down those shackles those physical shackles never held him in place he'd seen god deliver him out of that but he's letting him know i'm an ambassador in bonds to this gospel and he's asking him that i therein i that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak so he's asking for prayer to support him in still continuing to speak no matter where his position or placing currently in a physical condition whether that be prison or standing before nero that he would still without fear or favor still speak just as boldly as if he was standing before the lowliest of individuals that his message would not change that his conduct would not change that which he did would not change okay in hebrews 4 14-16 it says seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in a time of need so you see once again the re there's a reason for the boldness it's not for your own profit it's not to prove what a great individual you are it's not for your own edification but there's a purpose and a reason even for coming boldly before the throne of grace one was to obtain mercy the next was to find grace and the reason for both of those is to help in a time of need so it's going before the throne boldly in a request for mercy and grace to equip you to help someone else in a time of need you see that same equipping was happening in that entire suit of armor that paul was speaking of leading all the way up because it was those things that have put in place properly in your life that will allow you and give you that boldness correctly okay so i want to just bring a little bit of current context you know we know that we can always take a look at what's happening around us in our current world and realize that the natural type spiritual and if we can see something happening in the natural we know there's something happening in the spiritual and right now everybody is pushing the world be loud be proud be bold put yourself out there express yourself make yourself known that's what all the social media is about that's what the constant news coverage is about that's what everyone is trying to make a mark on the world and yet it's all for their own glorification it's all for their own edification everything is about me me me you know no matter what it is it's it's even in in most of the things that we do and use it's all things that focus on glorifying self it's about coming out and and showing the world who you are you see and many times we as christians we we think oh well we're supposed to be humble and yes you are humble but not hiding there's a difference you see jesus christ was humble but when he stood before pilate and pilate told him don't you know that i have the ability and power to take your life and jesus humbly but boldly told him you have no power for what i give you i lay down my life because i have a purpose for that you have no power you're simply fulfilling a role in prophecy that you cannot escape you see but there was a purpose there was a boldness he could stand as the scripture said bold as a lion knowing his position in the scripture he was not in fear he was in a lot of pain but he was not in fear he knew what was happening he knew what was going to happen and he knew it was fulfilling scripture so he could stand there and in humility yet still know where he stood boldly no one could take that from him same thing paul he requested to be taken to rome okay he wasn't dragged to rome he knew what the end would possibly be he knew where it went where it would end he'd been given a directive from god almighty and nothing was going to stop him from completing that and going through with thus saith the lord for his life so i have a few examples through scripture it's important that anytime we look at something that we know that we can find it in scripture and see what happened now like i said there's a difference between boldness and another word very similar and brashness okay in order to be truly bold you have to know where you stand and know that there's no backing down but brashness is one who ventures and and their mouth opens and it's their as scripture says as clouds blown about without water waves tossed upon the sea wherever it drives them in the moment they just open up and there's nothing there and there's examples of this through scripture in acts chapter 19 i actually won't read i'll just go over the story there was the seven sons of siva and if you don't know who that was these were seven sons of a high priest a jewish high priest they were in the ministry but they did not have a real revelation for themselves of jesus christ they had seen someone else's life and they had seen the works the mighty works and the miracles and the respect it brought them and they wanted that they wanted power and they went forward with what appeared to be boldness but was brashness and they went to one who was possessed of the devil of an evil spirit and they said by we adjure you by jesus whom paul preaches see they had no boldness they were standing on the shoulders and authority of somebody else trying to manipulate that to see if it would work for them but they had no life of their own to support that action they had no power backing it it's like brother madam talks about that policeman who can step out into the street and dripping wet weighing 120 pounds or whatever it is the point was it's a very small individual but he can boldly step out in front of that vehicle put his whistle to his lips and blow and then direct traffic and expect them to obey boldly because he has an authority behind his life that gives him the power to do that but let me and you step out in the street is trying to start directing traffic and more than likely you're gonna end up hit you're end up in the hospital and it'll either be because the car hits you or the maniac in the car gets out and beats you to a bloody pulp because you have no authority you acted boldly but with no authority you have nothing behind the life to back up what you are trying to do and that's where these men stood and that evil spirit immediately recognized it and said paul jesus i know and paul i know but who are you you are nobody you see because as long as you're playing games you might be able to intimidate someone smaller than you you might be able to intimidate someone who doesn't know better but you run into somebody who knows who they are in their position and if you don't have the proper authority you will not stand in their way and demonic power knows where they stand and what their position is and they don't stand down for someone who does not have that authority to command them so you be careful and know where you stand because this is no game okay so that's the new testament we want to know is this something that goes throughout the scripture and actually there's almost an identical story in the old testament in the book of samuel hofner and phineas if the name names don't ring a bell for you they were the sons of eli the high priest part of the ministry now israel had been given the land of promise and they were given promises that the land was theirs but it was based on their life and how they were serving god and during this time they had gone into a place of apostasy had fallen away and they weren't living correctly they were just coming out of this time of judges and entering into the kings and up to this time one after another the priesthood becomes so corrupt that we know that these sons of eli were demanding things and using their position as a way to enrich themselves and their own position sounds similar to the sons of siva they use it to wield power over the people not to actually be a blessing to the people you see these are wolves in sheep's clothing they go through and they're fleecing the sheep and not feeding them but what they find out is when they actually have to come and meet [Music] the devil on the ground of authority they have nowhere to stand to the sons of of eli hofney and phineas they the children of israel are going to war with the philistines who were oppressing them and you would think children of god being oppressed they have a right to fight for what's theirs the promised land and that follows forward to today if you stand on god's word you have a right to fight for what's yours what your promise is in the book but make sure you're standing where you should on the word so if you're not standing on the word you don't have a foundation to stand on if you don't have a foundation to stand on rocky ground gravelly rocky ground is never a good place to fight from if the ground under your feet is loose they may the enemy may not even need to knock you down you may go down on your own if your foundation is no good it don't matter what is on top of a faulty foundation it could be all the best products in the world when the foundation goes out the rest of the building follows know where you stand and here they are they're going to war with the philistines they'd have no profit they had no real leader and the other light said i know what we'll do often in finnish said we i know what we'll do we'll go get the ark of the covenant the the symbol of god's very own presence the symbol of god's promises to our people and we'll take it before the armies of israel and there's no way that the enemies of god can stand against that and they were right but because they were out of their position it didn't do them any good you know and the whole place under this false ministry this false anointing got really excited because when they brought the ark when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp here it is these ministers they're carrying the ark of the covenant into the camp all israel the entire church shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang out and i'm not going to read through but if you read it it said that it even affected the philistines momentarily the shout the what appeared to be such a great revival affected the enemy for a minute until they realized wait a minute it's all shouting there's no power there and you just go a few verses down and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fled every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter for their fell of israel thirty thousand foot men and the ark of god was taken and the two sons of eli hofney and phineas were slain you see you can carry a message book you can quote the message you can quote the scripture but if you don't have a life backing it up if you're not actually living a life worthy of the gospel i say run to christ run to christ because he is looking for a repentant heart the minute you can get back to the rock and fall upon the rock even though you may be broken yet you won't be crushed [Music] you see so we see in these two instances there was no life to support the claim of boldness there was nothing there you know we see that a lot today we see that a lot today you know and don't take this the wrong way i'm not knocking you if if this is your thing but everyone is is a christian on social media everyone is a christian that you meet on the street everyone you know post this if you love if you love jesus and if or if you don't just don't it's like how does that prove anything right you know or or this or that and everyone's out there and you know if if that mean is edifying to you i'm not taking that away from you what i'm saying is there should be such a life expressed in boldness you see boldness a boldness of expression is not just verbally in fact the most bold expressions are usually seen visually if somebody was to walk through these doors in a bright neon suit of some kind right now half of the church would turn around everyone would remember that person and that's even how in marketing and in advertising they look for something that flashes and catches the attention they look for something that sticks in the mind and draws you back to the message you see and we are to be the salt of the earth not a flash before the people but you are to be such an attraction that you would draw them to that message you see because they've heard plenty of messages everyone has a message today and everyone's trying to share it and everyone's trying to prove that they're right but live such a bold life in christ that they want to know the message that has created that boldness amen because guess what now due to that attraction they'll be willing to listen to your message but if not there's just so many messages that everyone has become tone deaf that's that's so true i don't know how many of you have spent a lot of time in the wilderness out in the forests or the the prairies or the grasslands or wherever it might be somewhere where it's just the sounds of nature and quiet out in the jungle somewhere you sit down and you listen and at first if you come from somewhere that's really loud and busy and you sit there it's almost daunting it's so quiet but you stay there for a week two weeks a month and you be will become so in tune to every little sound that's there you'll hear it you'll recognize it you'll know is that normal is that not normal but here in in the city in the metropolis there is so much noise that your brain automatically just begins to tune things out tune things out tune things out and that's where the world both church and and nominal is at today is there's been so much noise they have just tuned it out and they're just sailing on through life they don't even hear the sirens behind them until they're on top of them the warning something's wrong something's wrong they become so tone deaf but may there be something about your life that causes an attraction that'll cause them to stop for a moment and ask you about your message you see because if you've been to the mall or you've been walking down the street and you hear i know for me um working in the hospitals there's always overhead messages over and over again and you learn which ones you should pay attention to and which ones you tune out and just like nothing's happening but if i walk up to somebody and i say what is it what does this mean now they can know that i'm focused in and i have a desire to understand what that message is so it's got to be something to attract and draw me in and that's what our lives should be all right we're gonna keep moving now we saw two examples of individuals who were brash and look to be bold and even look to be bold for the right reasons one was trying to cast a devil out of somebody that's a good thing right the other ones were trying to deliver god's people from an oppressor good thing right these are not bad reasons okay in daniel chapter three you'll read the story of shadrach meshach and abednego okay this is not something new this is something we all know this is a common story if you've been to sunday school you know the story of the three hebrew children now they were bold they were extremely bold but you know they were extremely humble as well you'll see you'll see a reoccurring theme in all the children of god in the midst of knowing where they stand and standing boldly yet you'll see a humbleness through their life and those that don't have that life of christ inside their boldness is just brash and and and will push everybody else out of their way to get what they're looking for okay now shadrach meshach and abednego the king had created this great statue now if you know the message brother branham says that great statue was of daniel the prophet so they were more or less in a church service but they were so in tune with the word they were paying attention and even though the authorities that be said this is how the service is going to go they said that's not right that's not right it's not daniel that's wrong it's not the prophet that's wrong but it's the worshipping of the prophet that's wrong okay now you find out jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and the devil's never come up with a new trick that's why if you'll just get in tune and get into the word you can know every trick he has and how to meet it because god has defeated him over and over and over and then you can stand boldly when you see the devil coming in like a flood he said i would raise up a standard and a standard is something that stands against whatever is coming in and you are to be that standard that he raises up an embodiment of jesus christ in this age to stand against that flood of the enemy but how will you stand boldly as a standard if you can't recognize when you're supposed to stand or where you're supposed to stand you have to be in the word go back into the scripture what i mean is open up this bible and begin reading and say lord just show me one new thing today you won't it doesn't mean all of a sudden you'll know everything but lord just show me one new thing today you might read the same verse you read yesterday and if you're humbled yourself coming before him coming before the throne of grace boldly and saying lord just reveal yourself to me in this one little verse and he'll give you out of that verse that you read of that portion you read the right standard to stand boldly against the flood for the day maybe not the flood for tomorrow but for what you're going to meet that day he'll give you what you need and then you can stand boldly before the enemy shadrach meshach and abednego i think it's so beautiful what they said to the king okay they answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter they're telling him we don't have to hesitate about where we stand we're not worried about the end result of where we stand and what we believe we're not searching for words we're not trying to be politically correct we're going to answer you straight if it be so speaking of he said he would cast them into that fiery furnace they said if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us bold they knew where they stood on the word and they knew god's power to deliver you see but that's not just their only source of boldness okay able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand o king you see they ended with o king they still giving proper respect to the authority you see that they're not attacking nobody they're not trying to tear nobody down they're not trying to while you don't even deserve to be king daniel with all the things daniel has shown you and prophesied to you and you know we know daniel and how dare you treat us like this i said no king this is this is what you're going to do then you have all every right we just cannot do what you're asking us out of a good faith and good conscious towards christ we can't do it so even under the threats of being put in this fiery furnace we still can't but if not if not what if god does not deliver us from this fiery furnace be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up and we know the end of the story we know that god came and delivered them but they stood on god's word no matter what the consequence and they let the king know our god if he so desires he can deliver us from this and from you he's greater than all this but even if he chooses not to yet will still stand because we know what we are standing on is right we know that what we're standing on is true and that'll take a great revelation and know that what you're believing in is true you can claim you know you believe something and that you believe it's true but let yourself be put in a position like this where your stand on what you believe is true could cost you your life that's a whole other thing there's many people that say yeah i believe this and i believe that there's many people say i believe the message i just can't live it well that tells me you have a understanding on knowledge of the message and you can see that by that understanding i think what there's some truth to that but you don't actually believe because a true belief will have an altering effect on who you are it will change you from the inside out okay and actually yep now my next example in acts stephen he was a deacon i believe he was a deacon it says he was full of faith and power and did great wonders and miracles among the people then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the libertines and the cyrene sir iranians and the alexandrians and of them cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake he knew where he stood and he had such a boldness he believed what christ said which was take no thought to what you'll say when dragged before magistrates between before kings and powers that would be he said don't even take a thought he said i will place the very words that you will speak in your mouth and stephen took that to heart and as he began to testify of jesus christ before the people he has let that presence of god speak through him in such a way that the same people who came against christ found themselves facing the same exact jesus christ in stephen to where they were confounded at every turn stephen was bold there wasn't any place that he didn't dare to speak or stand up for this cause of christ all the way to the sanhedrin council he got dragged before and he preached the most fiery boldest message possible but you see steven's goal was not to raise himself up stephen's goal wasn't to make some big name for himself steven's goal was if he could save one person in that crowd it would be worth it no matter what the cost and that cost him his life because there was one that it affected but that one that affected still held the coats of those who helped stone him that day but stephen still stood boldly knowing where he stood without wavering you see steven actually had to take it to one step further and actually give his life and here he stood the same way as the hebrew children he knew the god that i serve can deliver me but even if he doesn't i still will stand for the truth and that had such an effect that saul of tarsus was affected in such a way that he became paul and became the apostle to the gentiles he became the one who wrote a majority of the new testament that we read even tonight you see because if you know where you stand then you know god has a purpose no matter what the outcome is for you look at william tyndale who all knows who william tyndale was okay if you don't know who william tyndale was he is the man who made it his job to translate the bible from latin into common english so that his goal was that the common plowboy could read the scripture and that cost him his life he was burned at the stake but the same king that allowed him to be burnt at the stake was so affected later that he is the one who orchestrated the translation and putting together of the bible in english the bible we all read today the king james version king james william tyndale was willing to stand boldly he didn't curse nobody in fact he prayed lord open the eyes of the king and his prayer was answered he would never live to see it but his prayer was answered and because of that is why all of us can hold this bible today and read it and understand it as the holy spirit would reveal it to us amen men who are willing to stand boldly no matter the cost now how do we stand boldly i just want to touch on a few things i already mentioned boldness isn't just in the words that we speak but i want to give you a scriptural reference here i want to give you just enough here tonight so you can take these scriptures it'll trigger something in you that you'll want to know a little bit more because if if all i do is give you something that sounds good something you enjoy right now but doesn't actually trigger you to have a desire to go and search for something more then it was all in vain yeah i've tickled your ears as scripture would say but we're not here to tickle your ears i want to give you just enough to be like huh wow i need to know more about that is what he's saying is it true is what he read is that true was that scripture read in the correct context was that quote quoted correctly because you owe it to yourself to know that you owe it to yourself if you don't already know that if it's not already resounding with you to go back into the scripture and begin searching from genesis to revelation and find out is that the truth because if you don't know for surety that it's the truth how will you stand boldly you won't you'll hit some point your knowledge will take you so far and you'll hit a point where there'll be a place you can't cross where you'll be caught in a state of doubt you'll be unsure do i know that do i not know that is it true well if you want to stand boldly go know it for yourself search it out ask god to reveal it to you in timothy 4 verses 12 and 13 paul is speaking to timothy and i love this verse i love this verse timothy and not for the reason i think that most people think and it says let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine now i think a majority of people when they read this let no man despise our youth especially young people right we read things especially when we're a lot younger and we don't let them despise your youth well that means be bold and don't let nobody put you down and you know stand up for yourself don't let them despise you no no no calm down it's all right calm down that's not what it means you didn't read through the entire verse you got excited in the first few words because it said something that made you happy but that's not it you had to read through to understand what paul was telling him it says let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers what he's saying is live such a life reflection of the gospel that there will be nothing in your life to despise about you okay and we know that because it goes on and he explains all the areas where you're to be an example to the believers in order to live above reproach and not be despised because of your youth because we all whether you're 10 12 5 50 60 70 years old in this room today if you're a little bit older than the person below you you're kind of like oh great there they are all them young people oh them kids they're doing it again and you may not realize it but you're just kind of despising them because they're not living at your level right you know if you're 12 12 and the five-year-old's trying to hang out with you but they're messing up the the toys that you're playing with you're like get out of here leave me alone you despise them because they're not meeting the expectation okay and that's what paul is telling timothy he said look it because of your youth the elders and the group around you will have a tendency to despise you if you don't live this life worthy of the gospel and if you're not living a life worthy of the gospel and living a life that's an example before the saints they have a right you can't demand something of them that you're not actually producing yourself and here if you're going to be a young person and a leader which all of your young people are called to be leaders leaders in your home leaders at your school leaders at your work right now does that mean you're going to be a manager no it means that you are to lead an example of a christ-like life before the people so that they can follow christ not so they can follow you as a manager of the company or the ceo that will do them no good eternally like you could teach someone how to be a millionaire a billionaire but their end is the same six feet of dirt in a box that's all in vain but you are to lead them to christ through a bold life live for him okay so now we know how are we going to live boldly by living a life that's an example before the people okay now in peter chapter three i just want to follow it up this was to the young people this was to a youth but it's to everybody right i think was it rather one i want to say it was brother one but i may be misquoting i maybe have the wrong minister and i just remember the service um who said age is just a number eternally we're we're all 18. so we're all youth so this this is applicable to all of us even if you're five eternally you're eighteen so it still applies to you uh first peter chapter three fifteen and sixteen but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear with meekness and fear so how should you speak to them through meekness and fear and fear is a respect having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation and christ now that word conversation most of us when we hear the word conversation we think of two people's talking to each other but if you take it back to the original greek translation the meaning of conversation here is actually your manner of life conduct behave or behavior and you'll find that conversation was translated that way in many places in the scripture so what peter is saying is having a conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers that they may be ashamed that falsely accuse you through your manner of life or conduct or behavior in christ that same thing that paul was telling timothy let your yet be above the being despised by others by the life that you live and peter is reverberating the same thing he's saying live a life so worthy of the gospel that those who would come against you would be even like the ministry that came against brother branham and said oh he's false doctrine he's off on the word but we never met somebody with such a christ-like character well how can how does that jive how can someone have a more a greater more christ-like character than anyone you've ever met before but they're not following christ because to say that someone was off the word is to say they are not following christ because he is the word so we have to be living that life that is such an example that they go i don't understand why you believe what you believe but there is there's anyone i've ever met that i would want to be like it would be you because you're such a reflection of christ that they can't help but notice they can't help but see and feel that very presence of christ in europe when they step in close to you because you create continue to create that atmosphere and you stand boldly on the word in such a way that jesus christ the holy spirit is there crea creating such a presence because you are in conversation with him you are walking with him that's where we are going back to is the point where enoch walked boldly with the lord every day every day he knew he was going to go and walk with the lord he didn't falter there he didn't go well i don't know maybe maybe i'm not up to par today and i'll just kind of go and see what happens every day he had such a relationship and such a oneness such a closeness he'd just say honey i'm going out i'm gonna go walk with the lord for a while here i'll be back after a while and out he would go no doubt he had no doubt when he walked out the door that he was going to be walking as adam did in the garden with god there walking next to him and they'd be talking and conversating the whole way and that's where you need to come to that's where we're working towards well we may not be there yet but every day a little bit closer a little bit closer a little bit closer why because if you want to stand boldly you have to be in his presence because if you're not in his presence how will he give you the words to say you see because the exact scripture let me read them to you i thought both of them were unique and i'm trying to be aware of time here and not hold you long but i'm developing a bad record um matthew chapter 10 in two points in in in the gospels matthew and luke and i want to just read both of them i'll just read quickly but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagogues and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak now that's a reassurance to know that he'll give you the not you don't have to worry about the thing to speak and it's also a reassurance knowing that i won't say the wrong thing so the minute you start putting your own thoughts into it trying to figure out what to say you're probably going to wreck it that's even that outside of spiritual things that happens to us on a daily basis it's like we we we think we got to figure it out and you go to talk to your brother or your sister or your mom or your wife or whoever it is and you say this what you think was this eloquent thing that you thought up and you find out it wasn't so eloquent you know so even if in natural things on things that we think we got our hands around we don't always do so well how much more spiritual things and how much more of an assurance do we need to know that when we open our mouth that he'll be the one speaking and we don't even have to worry about the words that are exiting okay take no thought how or what ye shall speak for shall be given you in the same hour what ye shall speak for is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you all right luke 12 and when they bring you unto the synagogues and unto magistrates and powers taking no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall say for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what he ought to say but how are you going to do that how are you going to stand boldly expecting that to happen if you're not creating an atmosphere where he can come by now how do we attract him to come by we know scripture says call on his name you know brother branham talks about it and says if you'll just start talking about him he'll come on by well what's the likelihood that we will call on his name or talk about him if we're not spending time here we normally we call on the people that we talk to the most and we talk about the things that we pay attention to the most and if this is not if we don't speak to him that often and he's not at the top of your friends list right everyone who's got social media you all got a friends list or uh some type of association list and the you know that you know within those programs there's algorithms that the people that you look at their stuff the most and they look at your stuff the most the algorithm will automatically bring their stuff up for you to see first do you know that right you know your brain does the same thing who are the people that you think about the most even if those people are problematic and are causing you issues it's going to be those that you're interacting with the most there could be someone really lovely a best friend from 30 years ago but you haven't talked to them in 15 years you might think about them once a year twice a year but the person who's the thorn in the side or the person that is bothering you at work you're thinking about them like probably several times an hour so i say what type of relationship are we building with him that in a time of trouble we could call on his name that we'd even remember to call on his name that we'd be of the sentence and the presence of mind to remember oh well what do i do in this situation call on jesus is that our first reaction because until you call him he's not going to show up and you can't stand boldly until he gets there and you won't talk about him to other people outside is if you've been reading about him outside of you've been listening to things about him it's like the love story right how many of you know someone who's in love with a they got a significant other boyfriend girlfriend lives close or far away how hard is it for you to get them to talk about that individual not that hard even if they act coy about it like there's some people like you know but but you see that like the minute you mention it they they start smiling and lighting up like they're they're playing the game that's the young people's game of we're not we're not we're just friends sure sure we've all been friends before and those of us who have been friends before know what happens with just friends but we can tell by your reaction to mentioning that just friend on what kind of friend that is [Music] and so should be with us is what kind of reaction does that stir when someone mentions the name of jesus when someone calls on him is it like uh okay we have to do this yeah i know a few things about him i can make it through this conversation because i have a general knowledge like you know i'll make it or is it yeah i know him too in fact the other day we were doing this and the other day we were doing that well guess what [Applause] he's of the type of the minute you start talking about him even if you're in the middle of a trial like the two men on the way to emmaus you know they were not like super joyful they were in the midst of the dumps but they were talking about jesus and guess what he showed up they didn't recognize it for most of the day but they were talking to him anyway stand boldly get ready to stand boldly on the word all right all right i gotta wrap this up let's see here yeah let me just read you one quote and we'll we'll close it up all right ah yeah let's read this one this is like when you when you bring too many have you ever been on a trip and you bring too many items with you on your trip and you got to figure out which one you're going to use since you bought it for the trip all right here you him 1957. i don't know if they they have that up there or not uh paragraph 37. i'm just going to read the whole thing and then we'll just close close it up i i believe the message has gone across it says well let's start at the top actually let's start about midway down on there i put let's see here where it says what we need is the love of god i give them a minute there so i don't get ahead of them um what we need is the love of god what we need tonight is men and women who will take a bold stand from the depths of their heart and serve the lord jesus the world's looking today not for a new denomination if i'd have started 10 years ago when i was in here i'd probably have been the father over a great denomination sure it would have been when men came to my house and said brother branham oh you got it in your hand do this no there was somebody spoke to me above and i heard him i don't want to start denominations we got enough we have enough self-exalted men we have enough people who use their boldness to exalt themselves what i want to do is be a servant of him love him and obey him and serve him well the bible said you are the salt of the earth you see salt is a bold flavor if you put salt in anything even in a small amount you'll know it's there or if you ever eat something that's supposed to have a little bit of salt and it didn't get added you'll know it's not there so he's saying be that type of bold be the bold in the workplace or in at school or wherever you're at or amongst your family so that when you're there they know it when you're not there they also know it okay today you can call yourself a presbyterian that don't mean a thing in the presence of god you can call yourself a pentecostal that doesn't mean a thing in the presence of god today you can call yourself a message believer you can say i believe a prophet i don't bring you any closer to god into the presence of god that doesn't mean a thing in the presence of god not one thing what he wants to see is a man or woman that's a christian in their heart that's what the world wants to see you see church has gone denomination has gone the opposite direction and they think well how do we how do we increase our numbers and bring in the world and save more people i know let's be more like the world so they'll be more attracted to be a part of us and the world that first saw that and it was enticing and they came in just like rome and niaceya rome where they said you know what we'll do is we'll use all these pagan holidays and we'll now give them a christian name the pagans will know they're still their holidays but the christians will accept them with those names and we'll all be one big happy group that attracted them in but brother branham in the message you many times he uses that term he said he said there's a song actually and the song is the one he's quoting he says we let down the bars we let down the bars the sheep got out how did the goats get in and that's where they found themselves is they let down the bars they let down the bars and now they can't tell the difference between the congregation and the congregation that's out and the world can do the same thing the world looks at it and goes me and you we look the same we act the same i already belonged to enough clubs and places to go i don't need one more for sunday and wednesday thank you much you see and that's where brethren said that is what the world wants to see if you'll stand boldly on what you believe humbly the world is impressed by that they may never see what you see but they will recognize that there's something to it there's something to what you say and what you believe i may not be able to accept it they may tell you but there's something real about you now you're living boldly now you're living as this salt of the earth the world wants to see men and women who are just exactly what they're supposed to be what you profess to be because they'll believe you if they can see it they don't want nothing to do with it if it if it don't look like it's true stand boldly if i wasn't for christ tonight i'd be standing here against him but i know he's real and i love him and that's why i'm here for him no doubt someday will seal my testimony with my blood but i'm be happy at that day for i know that he's the lord jesus christ and i know he cannot fail i know he's love you see here he is he's standing in the same place as all these other sons and daughters of god throughout scripture from the three hebrew children to stephen standing there before the council to a prophet in our day to those of us who will stand boldly on the word if you'll stand boldly he'll back it up every time every time if you don't believe me go back there's 66 books to read through that'll tell you the same thing there's over 1100 messages to glean through that'll tell you the same thing go start gleaning the field is ripe for harvest but if you just leave it there it'll rot in the field don't leave it in the field bring it home if ruth had never gone to glean she would have never met boaz if you're not gleaning you'll never meet him and you know it was the meat gleaning humbling herself to go glean the meaning of boaz that later allowed her to stand boldly in the lineage of christ be willing to humble yourself and glean and you'll find you'll be able to stand boldly as the bride of jesus christ musicians if you want to come let's just pray heavenly father lord we just take this little simple message to father and just want to encourage and challenge your your people here father lord to know that they don't have to go through life beaten down father they don't have to take whatever life brings them and whatever the devil wants to throw their way but if they're willing to go and stand boldly upon the word stand boldly knowing that you have given us a promise father you'll be with us even in us until the ends of this world father and we have nothing to fear we don't have lord the world the world says you have nothing to fear but fear itself and yet even fear is not a thing to fear for the believer father lord people fear many things but all those fears disappear and dissipate in the presence of the of the king the lord we ask that we'd be able to come father lord that all fears would melt away father lord many fears complexes people don't think of that as a fear but father a complex is a fear satan would want to put complexes on your people father trying to hold them down lord but you've come to break the chains of complexes you come to break the chains of fear and put upon them by this world put upon them by organizations and religious spirits father lord you've come to set them free that they could stand boldly and exclaim the salvation of the lord i will just dedicate this to you as you be with your people as they travel home those who travel both near and far you keep them safe on the road father that you would be their guide lord and that your presence would go with them and they would know where they stand in jesus most wonderful and precious name we pray just be it unto me [Music] according to your promises i can stand secured upon [Music] me free according to the world [Music] me um [Music] oh [Music] once again i would just want for us to take that word to the lord in prayer again ecclesiastes chapter 8 verse 1 says who is a wise man and who know where the interpretation of a thing a man's wisdom making his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed amen we live in such an age where an age that is just on the edge and people get so nervous people get so angry there's no anger in boldness [Music] there is no anger in boldness there is no rudeness in boldness if you go and look through the scripture and you look at the word boldness every time it was used it is almost in the same context of what we were saying is is is the grace of god or the holy spirit getting the hold of a man and getting a hold of a woman just like that scripture that brother jordan read in that hour while you are not thinking about it is not a premeditated talk but god will give you the right words there is no fear in boldness it is completely is a man being honored a man or a woman being honored the control of the holy spirit there is just there is such a peace in your heart you are not shaking [Music] god has not given us the spirit of fear he has given us the spirit of power other translations say he has given us the spirit of boldness that's what it is it's what god gives he gave the spirit of boldness in the hour of need for our weaknesses [Music] you are not bored when you are angry and you just want to say what is on your mind that's not being born [Music] in one sense that's been ruled if you just want to give the person the peace of your mind [Music] let's take our house to the lord tonight we are living in such a time but branham says with the pressure of this age sometimes we oppress and almost press out let's take our house to the lord tonight lord you have not given us the spirit of fear we are coming into that our lord father word this bride must put on such a spirit it would come from you it's not something that lord we can produce it is something that you give your children in the hour of need in the hour of need you find many of those believers that are going through persecution they will tell you in those hours of need something just got a hold of them and they were able to speak peacefully without fear just like shadrach meshach and abednego like our brothers say oh king they were not rude about it okay they were not rude about it they were not angry about it even if our god don't deliver us we will not bow down it's where the spirit the nature the human nature of man comes under control by the spirit of god comes under control by the holy ghost you are not choosing your words because you don't even have words on your own you are depending on god to speak through you you are saying father not my will but let your will be done church we are slowly coming to that place where we need to give a reason of the hope that dwarf in us the reason to give the hope of this jesus that we love [Music] father take away every spirit of frustration [Music] take away father lord every anger and bitterness lord and indifference lord because father this is the hour this is the time this is what is upon us lord this is what we are slowly coming into [Music] sometimes it's not a person when you when you read the news what is your reaction [Music] when we hear the things that are out there what is your reaction [Music] dear lord thank you for your word tonight thank you father for your word tonight we just pray to god it's not something that we can manufacture the spirit of boldness is now something that a man can manufacture every time a man tried to be bold in himself he uses cursing words and he said things peter was trying to be born when they ask asking [Music] are you not one of them started cursing started saying things father make our house truth lord make our heart tender make our hearts obedience to your word or father if we are not spending time in your word if we are that lord bringing our temper on our knees and our father where you should be glorified in our way you should take over lord many times we find ourselves taking over the wheel and moving this vehicle of our life right into shame help us lord help us father [Music] thank you tonight we pray that lord you cause us to think on these things lord may we go may we take our bible go and look in their fatherland and be able to read different different examples that the scripture gave us of boldness [Music] right there in the book of us the scripture says peter still good bonus this very man i was full of shame he was so nervous telling lies all over himself but when you got a hold of him when he got the holy ghost he could stand bowling thank you jesus tonight father we pray for each and every one of us lord we thank you we appreciate you tonight amen amen praise the lord we thank our brother for the word tonight let's stand on our feet and i was thinking about him
