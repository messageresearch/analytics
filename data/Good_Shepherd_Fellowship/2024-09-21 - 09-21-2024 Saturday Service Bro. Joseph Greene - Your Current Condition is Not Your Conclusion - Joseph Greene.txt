amen to praise the Lord to worship Him in spirit and in truth I believe that's the heart of the True Believer tonight amen to lift him up to worship him and to let this world that we live in know that he's alive and well am amen God bless you this evening have your seats for just a moment let me just get rid of the Jitters here for a moment or two it's always that way it seems like when you come to a new crowd and a new assembly but we certainly are honored to be here this evening uh we've met brother one some years ago and kind of lost contact and and uh he he called me we we've communicated a few times over different Brothers different missionary brother coming through and so forth but uh we never really had some real Fellowship until just recently and we certainly are honored uh to be here and appreciated him coming to our meeting early in in August and of course we had to cut it short because of some sickness and so forth but you know God knows all things tonight amen and we just certainly are True Believers in Romans 8:28 that all things the good the bad the ugly they all things work together for the good to them that love God Amen to them who are the called according to his purpose amen so we we are just thankful for that hope that we have and that reality this evening amen I bring you greetings from my wife and my son the church back home they're praying for us this evening we certainly do appreciate that and we're happy to have brother Eric Garden one of our deacons with us this evening and uh he makes a good travel partner and we certainly appreciate him coming and standing by our side and we just appreciate my wife wanted to come but she's facing some health issues and just wasn't up to the trip so uh maybe next time if the Lord allows it we'll get to bring her she has a beautiful voice and loves to sing so I know she'd be a blessing for you amen let's just go to the word I'm not much on formalities and small talk so let's just go to the scriptures tonight amen you'll find very quickly I'm I'm just a simple preacher but I I love the simple things of God Amen and brother renam before he preached the some of the greatest messages that he preached in his ministry he spoke the message God hid and revealed in Simplicity and I I believe that tonight with all my heart would you just bow your hearts with me before we approach the word tonight in a word of prayer Lord Jesus God how grateful We Are Tonight Lord to be gathered with brothers and sisters of like Precious faith and tonight Lord we're not here to lift up a aen lord we're here to lift up you our Lord Jesus Christ and tonight Lord Jesus we've come together Lord from different walks of life different nations even tonight Lord but God we're here for one purpose and that's to worship you and to hear from you through the preaching of your word and tonight Lord we ask that you would just take this unworthy vessel move the man aside tonight Lord and allow me father to yield my vessel to you God that you might speak to this people this evening God we realize your Prophet told us that it's the people their faith that operates the gift and I pray tonight Lord that you would stir the faith of the people and their their needs what whatever they might be tonight Lord I I have no way of knowing but God you know tonight Lord the burden of every heart from the eldest down to the youngest this evening Lord and God we just invite you to take preeminence Lord in my life and my heart tonight Lord my thoughts God I pray help me father to uh as brother Theo Erasmus used to say help me Lord to get the butterflies and get them inform formation tonight Lord that they can fly the path that you want your word to go tonight speak to our hearts tonight Lord oh God as only you can do this evening father we just commit oursel and the furtherance of this service into your hands tonight the precious name of Jesus Christ we humbly pray amen and amen turn with me tonight to the Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 12 and I want to read one one verse before you have your seats this is the books one of the books of Solomon and Solomon was a wise man and went through all kind of learning and exploration and all those things but he comes down to the end of this book and he says in verse 13 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word tonight as you have your seats we've already prayed so we just ask God to bless the reading of the word and you might think this evening brother Joe that's a very small scripture but it's not the size of the scripture it's the content amen that's what we want to look for this evening as we said Solomon was a very wise man he had much learning and he did a lot of acquiring knowledge and so forth but at the end of it all he came down to this conclusion or to this thought the whole matter the conclusion of it is that we fear God keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man amen and I I believe tonight that that statement is still very true it's our duty Amen to keep God's Commandments to fear Him amen and to put our confidence and our trust in him amen how many kids do I have Under 12 here tonight don't be bashful just one two three four five six okay now I said I'm just a simple man now I believe that we are a people of Faith amen right don't be afraid to say Amen so I'm the one that's got the Jitters amen so I like I like to give examples I like to do things that the kids won't forget now I've been ridiculed for doing this a certain way so I'm not going to do it that way tonight I'm going to do it this way now I want you to understand I have in my possession a $20 bill United States Greenback currency and tonight I'm going to give this $20 bill to somebody who brother Joe one of these kids under 12 amen I have to be careful because brother Eric knows where I'm going he might come and get it but it's for the kids under 12 okay it's right here you can see it until your faith catches the Revelation I'm going to give it to somebody I'm not a liar I'm going to do what I said amen now put your faith in action tonight okay is this okay amen praise the Lord now we we know the conclusion of the whole matter that's to fear God Amen to keep his Commandments that's that's everything that God looks at us to do amen God when he spoke his word and said let there be what did he do he simply believed his word amen he he spoke it and he believed what he spoke tonight amen and we find that God does not require anything more of you and I but to believe his word amen now uh keep in mind faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen that's right amen now as we go through tonight let your faith rise and when your faith Rises to a point you'll understand what I'm doing I'm going to give the $20 bill away tonight you may hear me say that a couple of times till somebody catches the Revelation now tonight we want to deal for just a little bit with conditions now I don't care who you are tonight it doesn't matter I should say who you are what your background is how rich you are how poor you are amen it doesn't matter we all deal with conditions amen I deal with a condition that I need glasses I deal with a condition I need some help hearing amen and especially certain tones and certain levels of of voice I need I have the condition amen but I believe what the word of God says that by his stripes I am healed amen so uh as we look tonight no matter how long you've lived with your conditions amen no matter how how many times it's it's it's affected your life or hindered your your walk or anything like that it doesn't matter it is just a condition amen it is just something that is as def uh the definition in Webster he would say a mode of being or a form of existence of a person or a thing a state at a particular time that's right Amen in other words it is a condition I'm standing here tonight amen in this little church here in uh whatever little town this is Outskirts of Minneapolis St Paul amen that is a condition but Lord willing tomorrow afternoon amen we're going to go to the airport and we're going to get on a plane and we will no longer more be in this condition now again I'm I'm simple preacher so simple illustrations amen now another definition is the state of something with regard to its appearance its quality or its working order now I have it home a 1931 model Ford that was my dad's that was left to me amen and for the last couple of years I've been busy and in the work of the Lord and the church and then different things and that a model or Model A is in not the best condition in other words I've I've neglected it and and and not got it cleaned up in fact I've got the carburetor off I had it rebuilt I hadn't got it put back on yet amen it is in a condition but God willing Amen in the very near future I'm going to change the condition of that car amen and and and the conclusion of that amen is I have a beautiful 1931 Model A coupe amen that that I enjoy in memory of my daddy amen so I've got to get it in a different condition so that that condition that it is in will not be the conclusion that's right I hope you're following where I'm going tonight amen now what we need to understand as Christians is that whatever condition you may have God has a remedy for amen for it's not what you have but it's what he can deliver you from amen it's what what mountain he can move out of your way amen we we look at things you know as a human being amen as just a $20 bill laying on the podium here amen as a mountain in front of your window to see a beautiful view amen as uh you know one time man looked at the skies and said oh I wish we could be up there like the birds amen that was a condition but it wasn't the conclusion amen I I hope you're following me amen so we realize tonight amen that through technology and knowledge amen man has changed that condition and they're no longer amen a a conclusion that they can't fly amen but as as the prophet Saul amen when Israel was brought back home they were brought back home On Eagle's Wings amen and we realized that was the jet planes that carried them home amen so whatever condition you're in or situation you face it didn't take God by surprise I know you all are familiar with sister Destiny and the family there in in Georgia and we have a connection because our Our Song Leader's wife is brother Daniel's niece so we have a connection there and we we know about that and we're so sorry so sadden to hear that but anyways H you know as as as we think of that amen the hardship and the the the the detriment of of spirit if you will and the Heartbreak amen that is just the condition that they're in and I'm not trying to be littl it or anything like that I certainly feel for that family amen but what what we've got to understand that is a condition right now amen that that's not the conclusion the conclusion is she was a saint of God she was a sister born again of the Holy Spirit and one day amen she will rise for the resurrection amen we'll meet them in the air that's the conclusion tonight amen now that's what we're looking for this evening amen now Romans 8:28 29 and and we quoted it I I believe for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate amen them he also called amen and whom he called them he also Justified amen and whom he justified them he also glorified amen so let's look at where we are tonight amen we have been predestinated by God Amen we've been predestinated for this hour amen handpicked by God Amen then it goes on Amen uh uh for whom he did predestinate them he called amen how many can say I've been called amen and whom he called amen them he also Justified so you sat here tonight as a son and daughter of God Amen no matter what what kind of life you came from what kind of sin you have committed if you put it underneath the blood of Jesus Christ you sit here Justified amen more Pure White than this handkerchief is tonight because the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed you from all sin not 2third not a part but the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed you from all sin amen so whom he has Justified if you've been Justified it's just as if you never never did it in the first place wow just as if you never did it in the first place there's no Footprints there's no thumbprint left to identify you as having done that deed amen you you it cannot be restored and brought against you again because the blood of Jesus Christ as brother renam taught us amen the blood of Jesus Christ is the bleach amen you sisters know what bleach is amen and you drop that sin in the blood bleach of Jesus Christ amen and when that drop of ink goes into that tub of bleach as brother Bram described it amen what does it do that bleach breaks it down so much that it can never be found again amen so your sin that's under the blood of Jesus Christ amen has been annihilated tonight it can no longer be called up in a court of law against you this evening God himself cannot find it because it's in the sea of his forgetfulness amen but we're not done yet those who he has Justified he has also glorified so I'm sitting here standing here tonight looking at a group of saints of God that have already been glorified amen just as if you never did it in the first place glorified by the word of God this evening and what God has declared that he has done for the True Believer amen thank you Jesus well brother Joel how can you how can you say that well let's just take an example I've heard a story told directly from the source and brother Tom Brown how many knows brother Tom Brown or new brother Tom Brown brother Tom went to one of the meetings sister Marilyn didn't get to go her heart was broken that she couldn't go amen but brother Tom went and he's speaking to brother Billy Paul and he said brother Billy said sister Marilyn wanted to come but circumstances wouldn't allow her to but today is her birthday would would would brother Brenham maybe call her and wish her happy birthday well I don't know brother Tom we'll ask him so they went and asked him he said sure be happy to so they got her on the phone and and brother Tom said honey said I've got someone here wants to speak to you so brother bam took the phone and said hello sister Brown sister Maryland I heard it's your birthday want to wish you a very happy birthday amen and the conversation went on and he after a little bit he said you know Sister Marilyn when I went beyond the curtain of time I saw you and brother Tom walking on the streets of Glory now she was in Ohio he was wherever the meeting was taking place but brother Benham saw them in the vision on the streets of Glory well that would make a Methodist shout don't you realize tonight friend amen they were walking in an Earthly body amen he was in a Heavenly realm and he saw them amen in a theophany body and don't you realize tonight that theophany body is already glorified amen so what what's it doing it's just waiting on me to catch up with it tonight amen it's already been glorified amen and it's just waiting till I lay this Tabernacle down and step over into that one amen oh I tell you that church we we with this message that God has given us in this day amen we ought to be the most happiest people on the face of the Earth amen we're not left in the dark about so many things tonight you know you you you listen to the denominational preachers over the years and you hear them poking at this or stabbing at that trying to explain it trying to put it together amen but I want you to understand find this message because this message has brought the Loose Ends and put it all together tonight and we're not in the dark anymore amen we have an understanding by revelation of what the word of God has declared to you and I tonight amen now in the message the 10 vergins and 14 4,000 brother mam said now that's a type of the Gospel trumpet you might have served the devil all these years in Chains with drinking smoking gambling and sin dirty things no matter what you've done but when you hear the gospel trumpet sound it's a sign that you can go free you can go Faith cometh by amen that's what brother bam did or the congregation responded hearing hearing of the word of God now you've heard the Full Gospel you don't have to stay bound any longer so tonight whatever your condition is you don't have to stay bound any longer because the word of God as we'll get to here in a little bit has given us exceeding great and precious promises amen of things that this world has no knowledge of amen questions and answers brother bam tells us this he says you may think you're tied too brother sister that wrote this question you may think that the devil has got you tied down there but he's lying there was one time a man come to Earth Jesus Christ the son of God he untied you yes don't you believe it don't you have to you or you don't have to stay down there no sir you're free that's right he died in your place to take away your sins amen you just believe on him flop your wings and fly away with the rest of them don't stay in that pit of the devil no sir amen so I believe tonight as message Believers amen we have heard thus sayith the Lord in this hour we have heard the message of Freedom amen we have heard a declaration amen you know we we here in America we we we look back and we recollect and remember the Gettysburg Address of how Abraham Lincoln made the the the famous speech that he made I'm from the south you forgive me so uh you know he he he uh he made that famous speech Four score and and seven years ago I think that's what it was and and and it made a declaration of Freedom this evening well I'd like to make a declaration that's already been made amen you are free tonight from sickness from disease from Affliction from tormenting Devils tonight you have been set free by the word of God this evening amen we all look at life and wonder how did we end up here and what can we do to get out of this and into our destiny well simple as believing there's a $20 bill on the podium waiting for somebody's Faith Amen to take care of it amen praise the Lord amen now we're going to move you from your condition tonight into your God given conclusion amen do you realize God has given you a conclusion amen you must realize Amen to have a victory you must have a struggle in order to get home on that jet plane tomorrow I've got to get on it amen I've got to get brother Eric and his nerves settled this is the first flights he's ever had so he was just a little nervous coming amen so I've got to get his nerves in a in a in a ball here and hold them tight amen and get on that jet and fly away tomorrow afternoon Lord willing amen so you know so when he gets home he can stand on the Solid Ground again and say I made it the conclusion is I'm home amen you got to realize where you're at in your situation in your circumstances you got to realize that it did not take God by surprise as I mentioned earlier our meeting last month you know the the the covid devil came by and and uh started afflicting different ones and it was just seemed like it was spreading so fast amen it wasn't my desire to stop the meeting it wasn't the the the trustees and the deacons of the church desire to stop it amen but uh uh circumstances prevailed amen and and in order to prevent the spread and keep some of the elderly and so forth from Catching it we we halted the meeting amen that wasn't the conclusion that we were looking for bear with me amen but we understood that all things canceling a meeting stopping a service amen halting a a special occasion

brother Ram tells us in why little Bethlehem he says another event that I wouldn't forget to call was when David was in his worst of time when he was a fugitive he'd already been anointed listen you have been anointed you have been called and now I'm I'm breaking in here now amen you have been called you have been elected you have been predestinated you have been foreordained to be what to be an over Comer of Leota David had already been anointed he knowed what he was to be in brother bram's terminology he knowed he was to be king God said so and yet he was hated I Saul by his his men they wanted him you know the couple of times that he could have taken Saul and killed him amen they got upset at him because he didn't but he trusted God sometimes we try to fix things when we need to just stand back and let God take care of it amen we just need to take our hands off and say Lord I'm trusting your word I'm trusting your promise I'm believing what you said amen and David believed what God said he was hated he was standing in between two two great deep fires here was the Philistines on one side after him and here was Saul on the other side and he was a man without a nation amen just as the church stands today brother bam said the true Living Church of God without a denomination or anything else she stands alone but yet she's had the anointing poured on her she knows what she is

Jesus Christ amen and the message Redeemer Redemption I hope the quotes are okay this evening I didn't ask but I'm going to do it anyway in the message Redeemer Redemption brother B said I love nature I seen one time a little story of a man that had caught a crow in a trap and he Ted him up to scare the rest of the crows away he was a jumping up and down well the poor old crow he stood there and he jumped up and down and the farmer didn't feed him anything he got so poor he just couldn't hardly stand up any longer so there was a good man came by one day and seen the old crow looking so poor and thin he just untied him all right and all the crows would fly over hollering come on Johnny come on Johnny Crow Winter's coming let's go south get out of this cold weather coming but you know what the old crow had been tied up so long till he thought he was still tied he didn't know that somebody had redeemed him you're you're in a message Church you should know that your condition is not your conclusion you should realize that by his stripes I am healed by whose Stripes you were healed amen but that Crow he didn't realize it he had that post there and he was just going around and around cuz his little string would only let him go so far he was going around round and round crying out set me free help me but he didn't realize he was already free let me just say to you tonight friend the word of God has already declared your freedom amen you're no longer tied to denomination you're no longer tied to church enity you're no longer tied to a man-made idea or a man-made Creed amen you have been set free by the word of God in this hour the revelation of Jesus Christ amen and who he is and listen my favorite one of my favorite scripture if not the favorite Colossians 126 and 27 the mystery that has been hear from ages and from Generations but is now made known which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen don't you realize if Christ is in you let me tell you tonight you have been sealed until the day of your Redemption amen and you cannot be lost well brother Joe there's this one backslid this one left a message let me tell you something friend if you've ever been redeemed truly redeemed truly Born Again of the spirit of God you cannot be lost and that's not a Baptist Doctrine I'm trying to promote tonight it's the word of God because the word of God has sealed me by the Holy Ghost until the day that he comes back and redeems me unto himself tonight amen now listen this Crow didn't realize his condition was not his conclusion just like a lot of young folks under 12 are not realizing the condition of that $20 bill is not its conclusion I'm trying my best the Lord amen to get you to catch the Revelation amen I'm going to give it away now I need to First understand that God has declared my end from my beginning Isaiah 41:26 who hath declared from the beginning that we may know and a four time that we may say he is righteous yay there is none that showeth there is none that declareth yay there is none that heareth your words amen it's him that has declared the end from the beginning it's God that knew that here on September the 21st amen that I would be standing here preaching this little simple message to you tonight I didn't know it amen but God God laid things in order brought Brother Juan and I together in a connection amen uh through the the missionary Brethren coming through and him calling me or me calling him to make arrangements or connections amen and then the next thing I know amen he says want don't you come and and visit us amen and I just felt in my heart that's what I need to do amen but uh you know back under I didn't know that but what I didn't know back then wasn't the conclusion amen all right Isaiah 48 and3 I have declared the former things from the beginning and they went forth out of my mouth and I showed them I did them suddenly and they came to pass don't you realize tonight that God in his word said I will have a bride God in his word said I have called a people for my name sake God in his word has declared amen there's going to be a city and there's going to be a people live in that City amen is declared there's going to be a bride amen that's called by his name sake now we we go down to the country of Jamaica brother Thomas Brady that brother Ram called out and what is the attraction on the mountain and brother Brady has been a lifelong friend amen he's been uh part of our family my sisters and I we call him our our other brother amen and and you know he he my wife has been with me to Jamaica a few times and as I said she sings so they ask her to sing and when brother Brady calls her to sing brother one he doesn't call her sister rexan he calls her sister Joe she is identified with me she is a part of me we've been married 46 years so we're we're we're pretty well a part of each other amen and and I don't look that old I know but we she she is a part of me so instead of calling her by her name he calls her by my name and don't you realize tonight that's who we are we are Mrs Jesus Christ tonight the queen of glory amen praise the Lord I hope this is okay tonight the Song of Solomon chapter 4 verse number seven we could probably all Quote it Thou Art all fair my love there is no spot in thee I wish I had it with me but I don't I have a picture in my file somewhere at home of you look at it this way and it looks like a an old lady with bumps on her nose and you know bump on her chin and just a lot of wrinkles and just really looks just worn out that is her condition but you take that piece of paper you look at that it this way okay let me turn it around so you can see the same thing I'm seeing okay then you take that picture and you turn it right over and there is a beautiful young princess same picture it's just the way it's looked that oh don't you realize you may look at yourself as a failure you may look at yourself like faults and failures and heartaches and troubles but I tell you tonight Thou Art all fair my love there is no spot in thee amen that's how God looks at us tonight amen because here this is not our conclusion this is our condition we're in this Earthly Tabernacle to be to be uh challenged and tested and tried and proven amen whether we can believe God or not amen right it's too early to go to sleep amen amen praise the Lord all right first Peter 2 and 24 who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed amen so that sickness that you've carried amen that Affliction that you've dealt with I want you to understand tonight by his stripes you were healed amen and those stripes were there in the mind of God before the foundation of the world so let me tell you tonight God's not looking at you as you see you tonight he's looking at you as his word has declared that you are this evening amen Isaiah 53:5 but he was wounded these are all very familiar scriptures tonight he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed so your condition is not your conclusion your condition is only a set state of of being at a given time amen that's right now this young brother over here he's sit sitting down right you're not standing on your head you're sitting down right on the red chair right help me preach okay that is a condition would you stand up he is no longer in that condition the conclusion is he is not sitting anymore he's standing right amen thank you brother I'm Different it's okay see because he's willing to obey my word God's word I'm going to take that and give it to him now that's not the one that your faith has got the rise to get it's it's still here it's still here somebody's faith has got to get it how how do you get the promises of God don't give my secret away they got to catch it by Faith amen all right praise the Lord Ephesians 1:13 in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed we done quoted it with that Holy Spirit of Promise amen so we have been sealed now my dad used to work in a in a veneer plant where they peeled the logs and made the veneer like goes on the side of the cabinet or the side of the pias amen they they would take in a big knives and they would peel that veneer or peel those logs and and make the veneer so thin and so forth but you know in that they would pack it in a box car and I know you've all seen the trains go through here carrying the Grain and different things they would pack it in the Box Car amen and when when they would get it all packed in all secured and all put in place they would call for an inspection and the inspector would come and he'd go in that box car amen and he'd shake the stacks of veneer he'd shake this one he'd go over here he'd shake that one he'd go over here and he'd shake that one he'd go back through and Shake all the stacks of veneer amen and if they were secure and they weren't going to have any problem of falling over then he would clo the inspector would close the door and put the seal a lock and a seal on that box car and listen catch this now amen that box car could not be open until it reached its destination because it was a federal offense Amen to open that box car if it wasn't at its destination and I want you to understand Satan has tried his best to get your box car open he's tried his best to discourage you he's tried his best to make you doubt he's tried his best to to cause you Amen to turn away but thank God tonight there is a seal on there and it cannot be open until it reaches its final destination which is eternity amen Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption amen now knowing that he has declared my beginning and he has I formed thee in the womb I've called thee when you were in your mother's womb I have written your name in the Lamb's Book of Life I have chosen you in me before the foundation of the world so we know that was our beginning right okay so knowing that guess what hey devil are you listening amen I was in him from before the foundation of the world and if I was in him guess where I'm going I'm going back to him amen there's nothing tonight that can separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus amen so I I I I don't have no trouble understanding and realizing I came from God and I go back to God and there's nothing that can stop it Jeremiah 29:11 very familiar scripture you see it on plaques and things to hang in your house and and all the hobby lobbies and all those stores they have them but it says for I I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an undecided end no that's not what it says to give you a hope for end no that's not what it says to give you an expected end I'm expecting somebody's Faith to take that $20 bill come on let your faith grow amen God has given us exceeding great and precious promises and how do we get them by faith amen but we don't get them just sitting there we've got to take God at his word we've got to accept that he is God and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him amen diligent means do it with fervor do it with excitement amen don't just say well I hope I hope he'll he he he'll give it to me after a while no you got to believe God take him at his word amen I'm not God but take me at my my word I'm a Son of God if that helps expected that m word means regarded as likely to happen amen the Declaration gives me peace to know that my condition is not the end that $20 bill is not going to lay there all night forgive me in my Folly but it's a picture that you won't soon forget amen let me get back to my scripture it gives me peace to know that my condition is not the end somebody's going to be $20 richer amen they may be broke as a convict right now but they're going to have $20 for they leave here if their faith Rises to a level listen I've used this illustration and you know what I've had to come to the point to where I put the $20 back in my pocket cuz nobody caught the Revelation I've offered it to individual young people said if you'll come and get it I'll give it to you nobody would move brother ju I got scolded real bad because one brother come to me after I made that illustration like that and he said you hurt that little boy's feelings when I purposely and explicitly explained this is how to get something from God you got to go according to the promise and claim the promise well anyways so I've I've tried to be careful how I used the illustration since that night amen but I want you to understand it's still available yeah healing is still available Deliverance is still available Victory is still available salvation is still available Joy is still available peace is still available happiness is still available amen the love of God is still available all things that God offers in his word it is still available tonight all we have to do is reach up here and get it it's yours for the taking understand that God has a plan for your life and in that plan he wants you to know that that the condition is your release to your conclusion you can't have the conclusion if you don't have the condition you know I I can't remember where it came from but one brother said I know what it was it was my father-in-law he had cancer in the lymph nodes in his neck and for 27 years they never could find the source he took some radiation and brother Eric back here works at a a sawmill my father-in-law worked at that Sawmill and uh he would leave work go 30 M trip to take radiation go right back to work never lost his hair the only reason he lost his teeth is because they told him they would probably fall out so he had them pulled got some Dentures but he never lost his hair he had a beautiful beautiful head of hair kind of makes me jealous a little bit but you know even until he passed away at 70 something years old nice beautiful head of hair amen and and and and and you know he he he trusted God and when they told him the doctors came in and said Mr Michael you you have cancer and said you know this is our plan of treatment and and as they finished up their their spill he said well praise the Lord how do you know God can heal it if you never have it so how do you know there's a conclusion if you never have the condition how do you know that you could walk away tonight $20 richer if there wasn't a condition the condition is you're sitting here trying to understand what brother Joe's saying so that your faith can grab hold and you can walk out amen with a with an ice cream cone or a a a whatever you want to buy with it it's yours if you come and get it oh I gave the secret away didn't I whoever faith says I'm going after that the kids under 12 keep keep your seats Amen in the power of transformation and I'm trying to find a place to stop here power of transformation brother B said but dear friends I'm not young like you all this morning but I'm old and I have been through many hard battles see and by going through those hard battles it brings you to where you are this morning amen see so I'm sure you understand that God has put me through it that my life might open up a way to say this is it see then you all run over that road but before me there was someone open up the way for me to go see and we open up the road one for the other and as you see sometime an old veteran getting old and his marks all over him and and as Paul said one time I bear in my body the marks of Jesus Christ you see how Timothy looked upon those marks I guess with reverence as he committed to Young Timothy amen and and and as the prophet was saying there amen he went through an awful lot let me tell you this morning friend or this afternoon evening only eternity will reveal what our Prophet went through through to get this message to us the miles he traveled the scars that he had on his Spirit of friends that stabbed him in the back amen of of of the hardship of losing his wife and a few days later losing his daughter listen that's marks that that scarred him that's right but yet it did not stop him it did not hold him back the devil thought I take his wife and his daughter amen I'll put him through this hardship and and the misery of losing a loved one and and and I'll get him so discouraged that he'll quit but they didn't realize he couldn't quit because he was ordained to bring this message he was called of God to deliver us thus sayeth the Lord he was called of God Amen that you and I might stand here tonight rejoicing in this message that's so real and Alive tonight he tried to take his life but God wouldn't let him hanging on the power pole working on the lines took hold of it and the next thing he found himself on the ground took the pistol and tried to to to shoot himself but it it wouldn't fire because God had a purpose don't you realize tonight amen your trouble your heartaches your sorrow your despair that's not just a condition it's not the conclusion because God has an expected end for your life tonight understand tonight saints that the condition does not kill you that despair tried that discouragement it made an attempt but it couldn't because there was a conclusion that had to come forth amen it attempts to destroy your confidence and Assurance in God oh you you know you know God he just don't love you to let you go through all this what he what the devil said to our Prophet God don't love you to let you go through all this he's not concerned about you but what the devil didn't know is there was a predestinated foreordained elected called of God purpose for that life you may say well I'm just me I'm just a little country boy from North Carolina God's not concerned about me let me tell you my Bible said we are Graven on the palms of his hands every time he looks at his hands we are there he sees us he knows us Amen in his mind we were in his mind before the foundation of the world and let me tell you as brother Theo Rasmus from South Africa came and he preached our meeting one year he said his mind is full of us so what does that mean he's mindful of us he knows our worries he knows our threats he knows our troubles he knows all about it but thank God Amen he has an expected end for you and I tonight thank you Jesus amen thank you Jesus two scriptures that show us clearly that God knows what he's doing when he chose you to go through your test Isaiah 547 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord let me tell you a little story I shared with brother one today how my dad was he was in the meetings in Spindale North Carolina brother Bram preached there and then dad's Pastor brother pardon that brought brother brandham to Spindale told my dad later said I had a interview with brother Bram and he told me my Ministry was to go and come to the mission fields of the world he said I failed to do it amen he went into business and he got so busy with five different businesses that he never made one trip so in the meantime dad moved away and then 1961 or so uh the Lord spoke to that he just he he wasn't tired of serving the lord he wasn't tired of preaching but he just felt like there was something more so he called a fast and solemn assembly for three days a Friday Saturday and Sunday and on Sunday morning the Lord he was pastoring the church two 300 people mission trips just just radio broadcast just really doing well amen and and that Sunday morning fasting and seeking God God spoke to him said leave here and go to Ruth that's where our church is Ruth North Carolina a one red light Town God said leave here and go to Ruth and build a church in my name for the common people that was Sunday morning Dad come to the pull pit that morning told the people the Lord has spoken to me told me to leave here are you talking about faith a wife and five children no promise of any support no promise of anything except God's word leave and go to Ruth and build a church so he resigned that morning left there came to RSE amen and started working to get a church built and established amen and and you know he he finally got it and and got things going and in in an old junk pile brush pile they had to clean it all up before they started building but God clearly had a plan and a purpose amen and then by God's grace As Time progressed amen he caught the vision for the Mission Outreach teach and m mission work and was already doing mission trips and so forth but it just grew in his life and his understanding and and uh from that time 1973 when this meeting started and we've been having the meetings every year since then over 50 years 51 years that we've been doing Mission work and and that's just when we bring Brothers together in different churches and and every offering every dollar of it goes to foreign missions to help build churches buy vehicles windows in in in the churches roofs on churches floors in churches bathrooms for churches whatever we can do to help amen but that's been the vision of it for all those years and and I'm not saying that in any bragging way I'm just sharing with you amen that that you know his discomfort in that situation amen it was hard he he he he didn't want to quit serving God he didn't want to stop pastoring or preaching he just felt like there was something else amen and God let him get in that condition amen so that he could come and speak to him Amen to do to do the other work amen to move and come to Ruth listen five kids and a wife to support and no promise of any income let me tell you tonight that's faith of getting the $20 bill amen praise the Lord and listen dad came back to Ruth that it was in our County where where he was born and raised the other County was was couple counties over amen but he he he came back to Ruth let me just tell you with wife and five kids 8 by 23 travel trailer had an old pickup truck with a a gospel ENT on it cuz he did a lot of tent revivals in those days and and and that's about it but brother ju when he passed away he was one of the largest private land owners in the town of Ruth you know came back with nothing but God began to bless him and God began to open doors and make a way amen and again I'm not bragging I'm just testifying of God's grace that your condition is not your conclusion amen prise oh my we got to understand that a condition is a weapon that the enemy forms against you amen you uh but the scriptures says it cannot Prosper amen what's the condition that the enemy has formed against you tonight amen you you have to be stepping back let me look at my note correctly here what's the condition that the enemy has formed against you that has you stepping back into fear and oppression what what's the devil throw at you what has he placed in your life what circumstance what condition has he has has has he put upon you to cause you to begin to question can God will God does God maybe there's nobody maybe I I I preach this somewhere else next week it'll have an effect Paul said you are as I I am for I am as you are yeah that's right amen amen listen let the condition form oh brother Joe go through a trial let it come don't you know that trials make us strong Amen Let the condition form just don't give it power over you amen you take the power that's given to us in the word of God Amen and know that that is not your conclusion it's just a condition a state of being at that moment it doesn't have to live with you forever amen I'm going to get ahead of myself here but just just bear with me we had a a sister in the church one of the Pioneers with Dad in the church she she was a Church of God lady but God got a hold of her heart and give her the Holy Ghost and she come out of that denomination and and become a part of the church and she went to the doctor had some some health issues health concerns and and and and the doctor said well Miss Connor said you know said I've treated your your sisters and all of them have died with this condition she said bless God ain't she she said they may have had it but I ain't got it I wouldn't have the low down devil she was just an old country girl but that was her terminology I wouldn't have the low down devil you know what she lived till she was up in her 90s still praising God singing song dad dad would ask her sister Connor you feel like singing with me tonight nope brother green don't feel led too she was just that way next service or two down the way she'd speak up brother green I'd like to sing tonight if you'll help me and Dad would always say if I can keep up with you sister Connor she was aged you know but she would sing and and rejoice and dance around her in her 80s and 90s and rejoice in the Lord that was a condition but it wasn't her conclusion amen she praised God on up into her latter years and the message job brother brandham said oh sure you're giving him everything he wants got him all hedged up and everything he said no wonder said sure he can serve you make him plenty of money got plenty of cattle got everything in life he said sure anybody can serve you like that said if you'll let me have him I'll make him curse you to his face God said I don't believe it the Lord is that what God said about you when the devil come let me at him don't you know the devil can't do one thing to you unless he goes before the father ask and leave as the old song says to tempt you more he can't touch you without God's permission amen so God let you go through these things building your character building your confidence and your trust in him tonight God said I don't believe it amen could he have that confidence brother Ram said in you and I tonight amen oh my Romans 8:2 28 and we know how many knows and we know that all things brother the Dan our former Pastor used to say that word all means all inclusive without exception everyone all things amen amen praise the Lord work together I quoted this earlier for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose you want to know what his purpose is it's it's all in the book read the book amen it's all there thank you Lord understand that the Bible declared to us tonight that no matter what the condition it's working for my good amen it was formed leaving a condition but it all worked for my good you know in my younger days I worked in a factory that made office chairs office furniture panels room office dividers and that company shut down and I was without a job and as as I went through I tried to start a little business of my own and different little things and helped my dad some with his rental properties and so forth and and uh selling a few old cars and just something to to make a living and and so I got desperate I needed some work so I I asked Dad I said dad and of course dad did it more or less on his own but I'm glad he did but he asked the church one Sunday morning he said Church let's pray Brother Joseph needs a job so let let's pray that God give him a job that was on Sunday morning Monday morning a sister in the church at the time she called called me she said brother Joe your dad said you were needing work I said yes ma'am she said well we I you know I work at the drug store here and we're needing uh an individual to to take a position and uh I I said well what what is that position and she said it's the janitor position and do other little odds and end jobs and in my mind I said ain't for me said don't want to do that I said okay I'll I'll think about it and let you know talk to you later thank you for calling before I laid the receiver down the old rotary dial phone you know way back in in the day before I got the phone to the receiver there was a voice that spoke to me what if I arrange this for you well God don't speak like that anymore well maybe you need to tune your ears a little bit but I heard that voice what if I arrange this for you Becky when can I come for an interview so she said come on it's a certain time so I went interviewed for the job they hired me on the spot no questions asked just told me what it was and what they paid and so forth so I went to work as a janitor working 12 14 hours a week for the one amen and then after a little while there was two gentlemen two pharmacists that owned the business the one pharmacist was older he's single never married he he retired from a merchant marines and never married the other was a married man had a couple of boys and so forth but anyways uh it got to the point to where I needed more time and more hours and I was about to quit because I was already working uh you know in in another business as well uh by that time and when the Old Gentleman Mr Henry as we called him when he got win that I was going to leave he he talked to his partner he said we need to create a position for Joe now listen starting as a janitor amen and and within a year a year and a half time I moved from the janitor to the bookkeeper had no training no formal education and bookkeeping but I went from the senitor to the bookkeeper and then after almost 23 years when I left the business to go full-time pastoring in the ministry amen I was the CFO of the company not just one company but two companies because we split the pharmacy into a walk-in Pharmacy and then a a a Home Health Pharmacy dealing with nursing homes and so forth and man we split it so I was CFO of both companies making a decent salary insurance pay amen they they took good care of me the Old Gentleman Mr Henry when I get ready to go to Jamaica or Guyana or wherever uh he would tell me of his Merchant Marine days traveling here and there and going to this place and the places we were going said now you need to go here while you're there and all that that's beside the point but let me get to the point amen and I would be in my office working getting ahead with the paperwork and so forth amen and he'd come through the office at at night and evening nobody else there but me and him and he would he would say so you leaving tomorrow on your trip I said yes sir he said well that's good said how long you'll be gone and I tell him amen and uh next thing I know he'd stick some money in my hand and say here we don't want you to get stranded an old Methodist man amen but he it was God that's all I can say it was just God that that blessed him and blessed me in that company almost 23 years I worked there not only did I work there my wife worked there three of my sisters worked there brother Dan worked there uh some nephews worked there some some cousins work there amen so what if I arrang this for you what if God let you go through that trial just to put you in a position to where he could bless you see God let you come to church tonight Under 12 so that you could be blessed but you just got to trust him and in this case you got to trust me I'm God's representative tonight amen so far I have no takers amen listen your circumstance your condition was formed amen but it all worked for your good understand you have to know that this condition is for the glory of God Amen my brother Joe how can that be amen look look look at my life my testimony that I just shared with you it was for the glory of God Amen because God allowed me to get jobless to let the company that I was working for they had they had voted in the union the people did and the company said that there was a squabbling courts about one vote and the the company said if the union gets it will will'll close down and move to another uh uh to to another state and uh so that's what happened that's what they did and I was without a job along with about 400 other people amen but it was all so that God could get me into a position that he could bless me the job shutting down that was a condition but the conclusion was

church amen that's that's God that's God 2 Corinthians 12:9 and he said unto me Paul his condition oh my his condition stressed him out he dealt with it constantly it gave him hardships trouble in life but the conclusion of that was that God had him in a position to where where you and I can enjoy the writings of his testimony and his experience and the revelations that God gave him amen oh my

your word that doesn't nullify your promise oh God it's still real tonight God I pray that the simple thoughts would Lodge in the hearts of your children and Lord God as the scripture said the writer he spoke and he said Lord I believe but help thou my unbelief I I I know Lord in my little illustration the kids maybe weren't too sure God they they couldn't maybe somehow believe that brother Joe

word and believe your promises that they are true and and amen let it be so God I I I pray tonight Lord God if there's one here with a condition God that that that you will let them see it's just a

to church they sit in their seats with their situation and go right out of the door the way they came that was just a simple way and it's a challenge to every one of us as parents you have to we we have to teach our children it must not only be uh uh that that was just an illustration but if a child is having a headache or the child is saying I'm not feeling well tell them when you go to church go let the pastor pray for you you're dealing with situation you see just like I was saying on Wednesday night we get so used to uh uh uh A system that until the preacher call for a prayer line we are not able to step out of our seats and go to the pullit and say brother I want you to stand with me the preacher has to call call for the prayer line is anybody here that need prayer they have to be begging is anybody can I pray for anybody we must be able to identify our situation and take the promise maybe something was preached something was said in the word and the Holy Spirit convict Your Heart Take that promise you don't need a prayer line you just need to step up by faith sometime you can sit right in your seat and say Lord I claim it you spoke to my heart to tonight or sometime you
