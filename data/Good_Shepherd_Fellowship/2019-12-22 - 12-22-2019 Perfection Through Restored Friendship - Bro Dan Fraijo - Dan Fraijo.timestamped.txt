[5:21] good morning Saints god bless you greet
[5:25] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:27] our Savior we are one more time to
[5:32] worship the Lord and give him honor and
[5:35] glory thank you for all that he does
[5:40] every day at least I can say that I'm
[5:45] here by His grace and His mercy and his
[5:47] love I as you know I had a little hard
[5:53] half a week just to I sure you all know
[6:00] I that's Wednesday when we were here
[6:03] I also led the services and it's just it
[6:12] just amazes me how God works
[6:15] and how he does things and sometimes we
[6:18] don't even pay attention we don't even
[6:20] see him we miss him but last Wednesday
[6:26] just to give you a little story here to
[6:29] tell you what's going on with me I have
[6:34] this this little cat and not cast but
[6:39] support we all left and of course
[6:46] brother Johnny here had a flat and his
[6:49] car and and I got ready to leave and
[6:52] actually I left but I usually I don't
[6:56] leave my Bible anywhere I carry this
[6:59] wherever I go and specially when I come
[7:01] to church and I was down the road down
[7:05] here on my way home and I realized I
[7:08] left a Bible over here by now
[7:11] coat hangers and I said uh-huh I'm going
[7:15] back to Turner I turn around and come
[7:17] and get him take you home and come back
[7:21] not knowing that brother Johnny needed a
[7:24] ride to his place because of the flat
[7:27] brother Juan was gonna give him a ride
[7:30] but he said hey brother 1 you going that
[7:32] way can you give Johnny a ride you know
[7:34] I sure so just to show you you know that
[7:37] when you have a needing whenever you
[7:40] least expect it he's there to help you
[7:42] you know all you have to do is ask him
[7:44] you know especially to the ones are
[7:48] always household you know his his people
[7:51] his children so I that was the Lord that
[7:56] brother Johnny neither
[7:59] helping he used me to do it so but
[8:04] anyways that same night I am I went home
[8:07] the one were like usual you know I went
[8:11] home and I got home and about two
[8:14] o'clock in the morning I got up feeling
[8:16] a little bit kind of a not feeling good
[8:20] well it turns out turns out that I had I
[8:23] had a burning in my chest it was like
[8:27] somebody put a iron in my chest I
[8:30] knowing what it was you know I I took
[8:33] two aspirins I I was getting ready to go
[8:37] back to bed it's hard for me to like say
[8:41] it's hard for me to to knock the
[8:43] hardwood down you know a tree down so I
[8:46] I said you know no I'm gonna I'm just
[8:50] gonna go ahead and go to the ER and
[8:55] check have this checked out so I went in
[8:58] there and they got me one of the
[9:01] stations and the nurse came in and she
[9:05] drew some blood I waited and this was
[9:09] 3:30 in the morning which bank it came
[9:11] back negative so they were looking for
[9:14] that inside when when the heart
[9:16] something happens to the heart it's it's
[9:19] the only organ and I think in the body
[9:21] that puts out that enzyme that lets you
[9:24] know that there is damage in the heart
[9:26] and so I say oh well I'm good we'll go
[9:32] home you know so I put my jacket I put
[9:35] my jacket on and got ready to go home
[9:38] you know and and and and oh they're
[9:43] badgering the nurse you know and I told
[9:46] her get you get the doctor it can t
[9:48] release me so I can go home it's already
[9:49] this is costing me money that you know
[9:54] and so and so uh and so and so she said
[9:59] so I'll get right on it and I'll hit the
[10:02] doctor you know so she I could went back
[10:07] out onto the station and sat down and I
[10:09] was looking at my phone you know
[10:11] and then the doctor comes in with a
[10:13] serious face I said oh she says you're
[10:17] not going anywhere
[10:19] I said oh okay why your enzymes are just
[10:24] a little bit too high so something
[10:26] happened to your heart you know and I
[10:29] said okay well praise the Lord I these
[10:32] two hours that I've been there I've been
[10:34] singing and giving praise to the Lord
[10:38] okay that I've been in that station just
[10:42] within myself just praying and asking
[10:44] the Lord for help
[10:47] well sometimes help comes not the way
[10:51] you want it but the way he wants to give
[10:53] it to you and so I I said well okay it's
[10:58] just so get back on that bed and you're
[11:03] the only place you're going from here is
[11:05] to the second floor to call me vascular
[11:07] so I said okay so they took me up there
[11:10] and they started telling me this and
[11:14] that some happened one doctor comes in
[11:16] and then another lady comes in and draws
[11:18] more blood for me I think I got more
[11:20] holes in my my arms that are Swiss
[11:22] cheese you know so and so I said I said
[11:25] I said well Lord whatever you want you
[11:30] know the the doctor said I had a little
[11:34] a little I'd rather say a little mini
[11:37] mini heart attack it's a mini heart
[11:39] attack okay okay meaning heart attack
[11:43] so they scheduled me for one of those
[11:47] angioplasty plans but something yeah
[11:50] that's what they call that you know I'm
[11:52] all scared you know because you know
[11:55] they're the one doctor comes in and says
[11:56] wait you know the cardiology comes in
[11:59] and says you know this is this it's not
[12:01] without risk you know I mean you can die
[12:03] in the table and they send the other say
[12:05] you know what I told I told her you know
[12:07] I don't want to hear that just tell me
[12:09] what you're gonna do and leave it at
[12:11] that
[12:12] that's it I don't want to hear that
[12:14] don't come over here scare me you know
[12:16] and so so I so I say Lord you know I
[12:20] don't want to go through this but now my
[12:25] will you will and so I I just as I was I
[12:30] was sitting there you know I just laying
[12:32] down on the bed
[12:35] [Music]
[12:40] got so good I feel like I'm sitting
[12:43] there and I saw this light in between
[12:47] the wall and the window and just just
[12:51] one little white light just bling you
[12:54] know and then another one behind it and
[12:57] then I say Lord I'm at peace because I
[13:03] knew he was there
[13:05] just to let you know I knew he was there
[13:08] that one of the nurses came in and he
[13:12] made a comment he said this is the only
[13:16] room that the temperature is normal if
[13:23] you go to the other rooms they're all
[13:26] cold said this is the only room that has
[13:30] a constant constant temperature it's
[13:34] just right and I said Lord thank you and
[13:39] so they came and got me yesterday
[13:42] yesterday at 10:30 in the morning reeled
[13:46] me down there and I just said well they
[13:50] put that tranquilizer in Hindi IV and I
[13:55] just said but I was talking the next
[13:58] thing you know I was out going out the
[13:59] door so they put a stent in me and now
[14:06] of course when they put a stent in you
[14:07] you gotta be in all kind of medication
[14:09] so praise the Lord
[14:10] I guess he fixed me I'm still here among
[14:14] you and I'm still here to give praises
[14:17] to the Lord and give Him glory so he had
[14:21] a we had a purpose for me to keep me
[14:24] here so I guess that the most the most
[14:27] thing I'm afraid is to leave my family
[14:30] okay that's because I love him so much
[14:32] even though you don't see him here with
[14:35] me I love him with all my heart but I
[14:38] but I believe one day they'll be coming
[14:41] through that door especially my my wife
[14:43] you know
[14:44] I believe it with all my heart so so let
[14:48] me do the little announcement to you I

[47:09] enjoyed the brother this morning out
[47:11] exhorting the testimony of the brother
[47:15] healing touch the beautiful song
[47:17] specials in tonight oh brother blood
[47:20] tape he puts me in a very difficult
[47:23] position that's a hard act to follow
[47:27] because we believe it's really the acts
[47:30] of the Holy Spirit in his people so if
[47:34] we can stay in tune with that same
[47:36] spirit here and then continue with those
[47:40] same acts by His grace and mercy this
[47:44] morning you may have your seats just for
[47:47] a moment that was listening as the
[47:51] brother was speaking on on prayers
[47:54] morning it certainly touched our hearts
[47:58] to hear anytime the word of god is
[48:01] spoken in a brought to memory a poem
[48:05] that Lord had given me a few years ago
[48:08] is as you sit and study and read on the
[48:11] Word of God sometimes and from the
[48:14] struggle of life mount up on you and
[48:16] you're just looking for something to
[48:18] speak to your hearts you know and as i
[48:21] sat there studying and thinking
[48:25] pondering it seemed like my thoughts
[48:28] couldn't go past the ceiling of that
[48:30] bedroom then I just felt has the Lord to
[48:33] say pick up thy pen and write
[48:36] and when I did then I become a scribe
[48:40] for something the Lord would want to
[48:43] give me and if he gave it to me then I'd
[48:47] like to share it with you this morning
[48:48] and the poem is called sunrise to sunset
[48:52] and these are the words he allowed us to
[48:57] write sunrise to sunset I will seek your
[49:01] face knowing the victory that awaits me
[49:04] when I make you first place fasting and
[49:09] prayer is where I'll wait for you in my
[49:12] prayer closet where your promises come
[49:15] true it's not a busy place where the
[49:18] multitudes abide it's the secret of your
[49:21] pavilion where bride and groom reside I
[49:24] know what's the best wait and yet I try
[49:28] it lasts only to be defeated by Satan's
[49:32] ugly blessed I dedicate myself again to
[49:37] the prayer closet with my friend who
[49:40] listened so intently to every word I say
[49:43] but when I listen quietly
[49:45] to every word he speaks it gives me all
[49:48] the strength I need to hear him say
[49:50] you're free free from the sickness free
[49:54] from the pain free from the lust free
[49:58] from the shame freedom freedom freedom
[50:01] free at last in my little prayer closet
[50:05] when I close the door at last so the
[50:10] brother speaking this morning provoked
[50:13] my memory to share this with you all to
[50:17] God be the glory for the things that he
[50:20] has done the Word of God is it's a book
[50:30] it's written in allegories it's written
[50:33] in Proverbs it's written in in parables
[50:36] visions and symbols of all kind so
[50:40] what's a book that can only be revealed
[50:42] by God Himself bringing to us a
[50:46] revelation of his word
[50:49] if you remember in the book of Matthew
[50:51] and in chapter 11 the Jesus speaking
[50:54] there and verses 24 and he says but I
[50:59] say unto you verse 25 and at that time
[51:04] jesus answered and said I thank thee
[51:06] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[51:09] thou has hid these things from the wise
[51:12] and prudent and has revealed them unto
[51:15] babes 2 things that he has done
[51:19] definitely done
[51:21] he has hid them and he's revealing them
[51:25] even so father for it seemed good in thy
[51:28] sight to both hide it and to reveal it
[51:34] to the world this morning it's a book
[51:37] hidden a mysterious book but to his
[51:41] people this morning within the walls of
[51:43] this little room it can be come to you a
[51:45] revealed word and there was there was a
[51:51] way that the Ministry of the Son of Man
[51:55] unfolded even connecting and dovetailing
[52:00] with this very same scripture here in
[52:03] st. Matthew 11 and verse 33 it says
[52:13] another bro another parable spoky unto
[52:16] them can the team kingdom of heaven is
[52:18] like unto leaven which a woman took and
[52:21] hid in three measures of meal till the
[52:23] whole was leavened all these things
[52:25] spake Jesus unto the multitude in
[52:28] parables and without a parable spoke he
[52:33] not unto them that it might be fulfilled
[52:37] which was spoken by the Prophet
[52:40] so his method of ministry had been
[52:44] spoken through the words of Isaiah of
[52:48] how he would minister what his method
[52:52] would be and the method was he was to
[52:57] come this Ministry of the Son of Man
[53:00] of Nazareth and all that he would say
[53:02] would be in a parable hidden from the
[53:08] eyes of the wise and prudent scripture
[53:10] dovetailing now connecting for us he
[53:13] said that it might be fulfilled which
[53:15] was spoken by the Prophet saying I will
[53:18] open my mouth in parables I will utter
[53:21] things which have been kept secret from
[53:24] the foundation of the world but these
[53:26] utterance would be in parables I will
[53:32] utter things which have been kept secret
[53:34] from the foundation of the world
[53:36] then Jesus sent the multitude away and
[53:39] went into the house and his disciples
[53:42] came unto saying declare unto us the
[53:44] parable of the tares of the field he
[53:47] answered and said unto them he that if
[53:50] so with the good seed is the son of man
[53:53] and he began to reveal to them the
[53:58] things that he did not reveal to the
[54:01] multitudes but yet he spoke the truth to
[54:04] all all heard the truth but there was an
[54:10] ordained and elect group of people his
[54:12] disciples those that chose to follow him
[54:16] to me said come away into this little
[54:18] house here this house that I built
[54:23] what house will you build me that one
[54:27] where the son of man can meet you and
[54:29] reveal his word to your hearts an
[54:32] example of how he hid his word in the
[54:38] mysteries of God in parables scripture
[54:42] well known to all of us would probably
[54:46] be the easiest example to share with you
[54:49] Matthew 28 and 19 so when you go to your
[54:54] Bibles to the young people
[54:56] you see read letter on white paper I
[54:59] want you always to approach it and say
[55:01] it's a parable there's more there than
[55:07] just the literal word spoken there's a
[55:10] deeper meaning in the words of Jesus
[55:13] because what he speaks here was in a
[55:16] parable and Matthew 28:19 says go ye
[55:20] therefore and teach all nations Jesus
[55:24] himself the last Commission to his
[55:26] church disciples go ye therefore and
[55:29] teach all nations baptizing them in the
[55:31] name of the Father and of the Son and of
[55:35] the Holy Ghost the correct water baptism
[55:44] teaching them to observe all things
[55:46] whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I
[55:50] am with you always even unto the end of
[55:52] the world
[55:54] and the majority of the Christian world
[55:57] today baptizes in the name of the Father
[56:01] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost and
[56:06] they and you asked them why they said
[56:09] what better reason then jesus said so
[56:15] what better reason than Jesus said so
[56:19] how do you baptize the same because he
[56:31] spoke it in a parable and the prophetic
[56:35] word works in this way one prophet
[56:38] speaks something here another prophet
[56:41] speaks something here and it adds
[56:43] detailed it adds detail to the Word of
[56:49] God it makes the picture full where you
[56:54] can begin to see all the characteristics
[56:56] coming together of this revealed word
[56:59] now this in Matthew 20 19 was a word
[57:02] spoken in a mystery disc was a divinely
[57:07] hidden truth because he spoke it in a
[57:11] parable but on the day of Pentecost in
[57:16] acts 2 and verse 38 on a pass
[57:21] so in a profit is given the revelation
[57:24] of the parable and he said can repent
[57:28] and be baptized in the name of the
[57:31] Father and the son of the Holy Ghost
[57:33] which happens to be the Lord Jesus
[57:35] Christ not scripture conflicting but now
[57:39] scripture dovetailing and bringing forth
[57:42] a revelation the revelation of the
[57:44] probable that was spoken that Isaiah
[57:47] said he would speak in parables and he
[57:52] would say nothing but what it would be
[57:54] in a parable then how do you get the
[57:59] revelation this is how the disciples did
[58:02] it they said Lord Jesus we don't
[58:06] understand what you said either he said
[58:12] let me push the multitudes away and you
[58:16] come to church Sunday morning little
[58:19] group I'll see to it the doors closed
[58:22] where I can speak to you in private
[58:25] could it could it be the same Jesus the
[58:29] same yesterday today and forever doing
[58:31] the same things the same way for his
[58:33] children that you might become a
[58:37] disciple of years and then go out he
[58:42] into the world and preach the same
[58:44] gospel now the revealed Word of God oh
[58:48] my do you love them this morning with
[58:55] that said if you'll stand to your feet
[58:57] this morning
[59:04] that was just a few foundational
[59:07] statements so I haven't begun yet but
[59:12] now I am starting Matthew five and verse
[59:17] 48 and with that concept in mind we'll
[59:24] share this from the Word of God with you
[59:26] I entitled it perfection two restored
[59:31] friendship for a title and for the
[59:34] subject adoption the process perfection
[59:38] the capstone Matthew five and verse 48
[59:46] it reads like this be ye therefore
[59:52] perfect even as your father which is in
[59:55] heaven is perfect
[59:58] as we bow our heads Heavenly Father
[1:00:01] if you said and required it of us then
[1:00:07] surely you'll make away this morning and
[1:00:09] we thank you for that in Jesus name Amen
[1:00:13] you may be seated thank you sir ah very
[1:00:22] nice
[1:00:24] very handy
[1:00:26] and so simple perfection - restored
[1:00:31] friendship adoption the process
[1:00:34] perfection the capstone Matthew 5:48
[1:00:38] said be ye therefore perfect even as
[1:00:42] your father which is in heaven is
[1:00:44] perfect I think the word perfect the
[1:00:47] Greek it means to make perfect it means
[1:00:52] to finish it means to consecrate to make
[1:00:55] perfect to complete to carry through
[1:00:57] completely to accomplish something to
[1:01:00] bring to an end a goal of some kind that
[1:01:03] you might have to bring or to close or
[1:01:06] to bring to fulfillment by events the
[1:01:09] prophecies of the scripture perfection a
[1:01:14] definition from Webster from Greek
[1:01:18] theologians but in the fact here an age
[1:01:22] brought them brother Branham said this
[1:01:24] exposition of the church ages in such
[1:01:27] tribulation worketh patience he said how
[1:01:30] highly God regards us outworking of our
[1:01:33] patience is seen in James 1 and 4 but
[1:01:36] let patience have her perfect work now
[1:01:39] you may be perfect entire lacking
[1:01:42] nothing prophet said God's will for us
[1:01:45] is perfection and that perfection is
[1:01:48] patience waiting on God and waiting for
[1:01:51] God this is the process of character
[1:01:55] development
[1:01:55] so perfection has a process and the Lord
[1:01:58] Jesus was the first ever to bring us an
[1:02:01] intense teaching of all the components
[1:02:03] that take us to perfection
[1:02:06] the process is called the adoption of
[1:02:08] sons and daughters of God the process to
[1:02:11] arrive to adoption is called the three
[1:02:13] steps of grace justification by faith
[1:02:17] sanctification by the spirit the baptism
[1:02:21] of the Holy Ghost it brings us to the
[1:02:25] born-again experience it is a process
[1:02:29] like the seed being sown in the ground
[1:02:32] there's a process to my the way what
[1:02:35] looks like the seed becoming undone
[1:02:38] is really the seed coming to perfection
[1:02:41] Hebrew 718 Paul told the Hebrews for
[1:02:46] theirs verily additional e'en of the
[1:02:48] commandment going before for the
[1:02:51] weakness and improv herbalist thereof
[1:02:54] yes he was speaking of all ten of them
[1:02:57] the commandments and Jesus in his
[1:02:59] parable and adoption and perfection also
[1:03:02] mentions him tells us how they were
[1:03:05] being dissing 'old Hebrews 7 19 and the
[1:03:10] reason for the law made nothing perfect
[1:03:13] Apostle Paul said but the bringing in of
[1:03:17] a better hope did by the which we draw
[1:03:19] nigh unto God now we can see it in the
[1:03:23] words of the Apostle Paul the reason for
[1:03:26] a new covenant for man had been gone far
[1:03:30] from God as the parable of the prodigal
[1:03:33] son when the father said and he seen him
[1:03:37] afar off he seen him afar off in sin he
[1:03:41] seen him afar off in divorce he seen him
[1:03:43] afar off as a poor father he seen him
[1:03:46] afar off as a drug he seen him afar off
[1:03:48] a son but he determined to bring that
[1:03:52] son back through our process to
[1:03:54] perfection from the miry clay to a
[1:03:58] perfect son and daughter of God here it
[1:04:03] is the admonition of God when he's
[1:04:07] opening the book that Adam last I'm
[1:04:09] telling us things that had been hit
[1:04:11] since the foundation of the world for
[1:04:13] the first time since he spoken to Adam
[1:04:16] once again lip to ears to Adams fallen
[1:04:21] race you'll get to hear it
[1:04:30] this is what Adam heard that day in Eden
[1:04:33] just before the fall he heard God the
[1:04:42] Father tell him Adam biggie therefore
[1:04:48] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:04:51] heaven is perfect that's what Adam heard
[1:05:00] now the second Adam is telling you the
[1:05:04] same thing
[1:05:05] God rich in mercy these are not just New
[1:05:10] Testament admonitions this was in the
[1:05:14] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:05:18] world tell me what Word of God that's
[1:05:21] written in the New Testament isn't an
[1:05:24] eternal word tell me what statement he
[1:05:27] didn't make to adopt and bring you back
[1:05:29] into his fold isn't something he didn't
[1:05:33] speak to Adam tell me something that he
[1:05:36] didn't say that he didn't tell Adam and
[1:05:38] when the first Adam fell and his wife
[1:05:41] failed God the Father wanted to bring
[1:05:45] you to that same place with him a
[1:05:47] restored friendship with the father
[1:05:52] Matthew five and six and seven is Jesus
[1:05:57] teaching on perfection and the process
[1:06:00] is to take us there
[1:06:02] adoption by the Holy Spirit adoption by
[1:06:07] the father justification by faith
[1:06:11] sanctification by the Spirit the baptism
[1:06:15] of the Holy Ghost and a prophet told us
[1:06:19] you've just begun your Christian walk
[1:06:22] and your friendship with her father just
[1:06:26] begun Matthew 8:1 says when he was come
[1:06:31] down from the mountain great multitudes
[1:06:34] followed him they followed him because
[1:06:38] of the teaching
[1:06:40] he had brought his teaching to a closed
[1:06:42] and finished with a comma and the
[1:06:46] multitudes followed him because they
[1:06:47] knew there was more oh that's why we
[1:06:50] should follow him today every time you
[1:06:52] hear something from the Word of God it
[1:06:55] should bring you to a place I want to
[1:06:57] keep following him because I know what
[1:07:00] he said but he put a comma so there must
[1:07:03] be more for me in this Christian walk
[1:07:08] where Jesus began was in Matthew 5 and
[1:07:12] verse 1 in Hebrews 6 and 1 Paul tells us
[1:07:17] let us go on to perfection and Paul was
[1:07:21] speaking of the things that Jesus had
[1:07:23] already said that was the perfection
[1:07:26] Paul was speaking of Matthew 5:1 when we
[1:07:32] read Matthew 5:48 he says go ye be he
[1:07:37] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:07:40] heaven is perfect
[1:07:42] the therefore part is because of 47
[1:07:47] verses prior to the 48 the therefore
[1:07:52] part is because of the prior 47 verses
[1:07:56] because of what I've already told you
[1:08:00] because of those 47 verses of a parable
[1:08:04] wherein lays a revelation a divinely
[1:08:08] revealed mystery for you because of
[1:08:10] those 47 verses if you can catch the
[1:08:13] revelation you can enter into this
[1:08:15] process a character-building process
[1:08:18] unto adoption perfection a body change a
[1:08:22] translation to be quick and change and
[1:08:25] translated by the power of the Holy
[1:08:27] Ghost but you've got to be able to
[1:08:30] Caesar therefore when all you see is
[1:08:34] biggie therefore perfect even as your
[1:08:38] father in heaven is perfect that's a
[1:08:41] young boy growing up to holiness
[1:08:43] churches in the Pentecostal movement but
[1:08:48] I want to be
[1:08:49] ten you'll forget it you're just a boy
[1:08:51] you don't understand it
[1:08:53] we cannot be perfect but Jesus it
[1:09:00] stopped you're just a child you don't
[1:09:04] understand he was right I didn't but now
[1:09:08] I realized that he didn't either neither
[1:09:12] one of us did neither the young or the
[1:09:14] old in the parable of the prodigal son
[1:09:17] there's a great mystery lain in there
[1:09:20] there's a way of the younger there's the
[1:09:23] way of the older and there's God's
[1:09:25] provided ways it's God's Way that we
[1:09:28] want not even the way of the older
[1:09:31] always is the better way but the
[1:09:35] father's way so therefore he said
[1:09:38] because of these 47 verses that I've
[1:09:41] spoke to you if you can catch the
[1:09:44] revelation that can be come to your
[1:09:46] divinely revealed mystery truth you will
[1:09:49] be made perfect so where Jesus began in
[1:09:56] his teaching of perfection because the
[1:10:00] concluding statement declares what he
[1:10:04] was speaking of in verse 48 he reveals
[1:10:09] to us that the forty seven verses have
[1:10:11] to do with you being perfect as the
[1:10:14] father's perfect great theologians read
[1:10:20] through it processed it wrote books and
[1:10:23] they finally said let's call it the
[1:10:27] Beatitudes I say I like the name but
[1:10:37] they were looking at from a different
[1:10:38] perspective not being made perfect just
[1:10:46] maybe better human behavior will teach
[1:10:51] not perfection
[1:10:54] affection is beyond psychology and good
[1:10:57] human behavior it's beyond for one is
[1:11:01] only natural you're trying the other is
[1:11:05] supernatural you're overcoming Matthew
[1:11:11] five and verse 1 and seeing the
[1:11:13] multitudes he went up into a mountain
[1:11:15] and when he was set his disciples came
[1:11:19] unto Him and he opened his mouth and
[1:11:21] taught them saying blessed are the poor
[1:11:24] in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[1:11:27] heaven what is it a parable it seems so
[1:11:36] plain to read it and yet it's a parable
[1:11:40] so if a parable then a truth is laying
[1:11:45] in there that's been hidden since before
[1:11:46] the foundation of the world
[1:11:50] the father alone to a restored
[1:11:53] friendship can make known to you and he
[1:11:57] opened his mouth to taught them saying
[1:11:59] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[1:12:01] theirs is the kingdom of heaven Paul
[1:12:05] said in Hebrews five and nine and being
[1:12:08] made perfect he became the author of
[1:12:13] eternal salvation all to all them that
[1:12:17] obey Him so we're being taught by him
[1:12:21] that was made perfect in a flesh body
[1:12:25] who is also the author of eternal
[1:12:29] salvation
[1:12:30] so the perfection is promised you as he
[1:12:34] achieved it in his own flesh body so
[1:12:38] that you could know it's possible for
[1:12:41] you to achieve it in this flesh body
[1:12:44] oh what a teacher not just in word but
[1:12:52] in deed an in power of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:57] and the thigh Theory interchange of
[1:12:59] profits is this once again how highly
[1:13:03] God rewards regards is outworking of our
[1:13:07] patients have seen in James when for he
[1:13:09] said but let patience have her perfect
[1:13:11] work that you may be perfect an entire
[1:13:17] lacking nothing James caught the
[1:13:21] revelation Paul caught the revelation
[1:13:24] Peter caught the revelation on
[1:13:27] perfection God's will for us is
[1:13:32] perfection and that perfection is
[1:13:35] patience waiting on God waiting for God
[1:13:38] this is the process of character
[1:13:42] development when we have a restored
[1:13:45] friendship with the Father Matthew five
[1:13:50] and three blessed or the porns spirit
[1:13:53] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven in
[1:13:57] spirit means to encourage enliven
[1:14:03] someone now the word in spirit in the
[1:14:08] text of Matthew 5:3
[1:14:10] is separated as two words but you know
[1:14:14] the word in spirit is also a correct
[1:14:16] word when you put it together and it
[1:14:19] changes the meaning and when you combine
[1:14:22] them and dovetail them together in
[1:14:26] spirit means to encourage and to enliven
[1:14:30] blessed are the poor that I will
[1:14:33] encourage and enliven for theirs is the
[1:14:36] kingdom of heaven by simply removing the
[1:14:43] space by simply removing the partition
[1:14:47] and running them together the word in
[1:14:50] spirit changes the whole context changes
[1:14:54] the meaning
[1:14:58] and that principle holds true in many
[1:15:01] scriptures and prophecies of the Bible
[1:15:04] when our prophet came to us in this day
[1:15:07] and just by moving a comma turned a word
[1:15:13] turned a prophecy that in the eyes of
[1:15:16] great students and learned it men of the
[1:15:19] English language saw it perfectly
[1:15:22] grammatically correct and yet made it
[1:15:24] prophetically wrong hmm yes someone I
[1:15:31] can hear him saying show me an example
[1:15:32] of that turn with me as we terribly jump
[1:15:41] off our subject for a moment and go to
[1:15:43] revelations chapter 5 we will see where
[1:15:49] a prophet would change the grammar to
[1:15:53] give us the correct prophetic meaning of
[1:15:56] these divinely revealed word and verse 5
[1:16:01] and 1 of Revelation says and I saw on
[1:16:03] the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:16:06] throne a book written within and on the
[1:16:08] backside , and on the backside sealed
[1:16:13] with seven seals so now in the context
[1:16:17] of how this is written grammatically it
[1:16:19] looks as though there's something on the
[1:16:23] backside written and the backside part
[1:16:27] is sealed and when a prophet preached it
[1:16:31] in 1962 sirs what time is it he leaned
[1:16:35] that direction because of how was
[1:16:38] grammatically written but when you've
[1:16:41] followed the line of the word he
[1:16:43] preaches the breech and another quotes
[1:16:47] from the message he says no he says
[1:16:49] there's nothing written on the backside
[1:16:52] everything must be within the atonement
[1:16:55] of what Jesus did for us
[1:16:59] and when he read it again in the breech
[1:17:04] he read it differently and I saw on the
[1:17:07] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:17:08] a book written
[1:17:10] within now a comma and on the backside
[1:17:16] sealed with seven seals so what was
[1:17:19] grammatically correct but changed the
[1:17:22] prophetic meaning now becomes
[1:17:23] prophetically correct and grammatically
[1:17:26] wrong who wants the revelation or who
[1:17:31] wants to speak a perfect English I speak
[1:17:39] English
[1:17:40] your espanol auntie Francis but what I
[1:17:43] want is revelation going back to our
[1:17:52] subject in spirit remove the space put
[1:17:58] it together one word now means to
[1:18:01] encourage and enliven someone we have
[1:18:04] five senses of the Spirit we have five
[1:18:06] senses of the body both are given to us
[1:18:10] to contact this earth we live in and
[1:18:13] other human beings but not God being
[1:18:18] poor in spirit is a time when as men and
[1:18:21] women we come into desperation through
[1:18:24] discouragement and we no longer have the
[1:18:28] confidence in our own cells a person
[1:18:31] porn spirit the five senses of the
[1:18:35] Spirit our memory imagination conscious
[1:18:39] affection reasoning when through these
[1:18:44] five senses we can no longer encourage
[1:18:46] ourselves we need God to take control
[1:18:49] and come on the scene and it's a good
[1:18:53] place to be for the believer it's
[1:18:56] actually your Exodus journey the
[1:19:00] beginning unto perfection it's not your
[1:19:04] end brother sister it's your beginning
[1:19:09] in Genesis 18 Sarah found herself a
[1:19:14] woman poor in spirit a woman that she
[1:19:21] felt she could no longer be encouraged
[1:19:23] or enlivened in herself and in Genesis
[1:19:32] 18 and 1 the Word of God says and the
[1:19:34] Lord appeared unto him Abraham in the
[1:19:38] plains of Mamre words are interesting we
[1:19:45] can take them to extremes of course and
[1:19:48] I dare say I've done it myself sometimes
[1:19:50] to make a point but the word mom reached
[1:19:55] when used as a verb it means change it
[1:19:59] means change so let me read it in that
[1:20:03] context and the Lord appeared unto him
[1:20:05] in the plains of change and he sat in
[1:20:09] the tent door in the heat of the day and
[1:20:12] he lift up his eyes and looked and lo
[1:20:14] three men stood by him and when he saw
[1:20:16] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[1:20:18] door and bowed himself towards the
[1:20:21] ground
[1:20:22] fast forward to verse 9
[1:20:28] Abraham speaking to them and they said
[1:20:31] come to him where is Sarah thy wife and
[1:20:33] he said behold in the tent and he said I
[1:20:37] will certainly return unto the according
[1:20:39] to the time of life and lo Sarah thy
[1:20:42] wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it
[1:20:45] in the tent door which was behind him or
[1:20:48] she was behind him and he was in front
[1:20:52] verse 11 now Abraham and Sarah were old
[1:20:56] and well stricken in age and it ceased
[1:21:00] to be with Sarah after the manner of
[1:21:02] women therefore Sarah left within
[1:21:06] herself saying after I'm waxed old shall
[1:21:10] I have pleasure my lord being old also
[1:21:14] here was a woman poor in spirit
[1:21:19] after having waited on Abraham's
[1:21:21] inspiration and hope almost 25 years of
[1:21:25] waiting and it didn't happen in what she
[1:21:28] thought was a reasonable amount of time
[1:21:35] Abraham my husband I love you but you
[1:21:42] don't get it you're not getting that
[1:21:45] Abraham I don't feel a thing
[1:21:49] nothing personal her memory told her she
[1:22:03] couldn't ever remember a woman as old as
[1:22:05] her that had ever had a child in her
[1:22:08] imagination she couldn't imagine her
[1:22:10] being the first her conscious said this
[1:22:14] is unconscionable her affections said at
[1:22:21] my age I don't even desire to take care
[1:22:23] of a little baby anymore
[1:22:24] it's too much in her reasoning she had
[1:22:32] reason her all the way and she had
[1:22:34] laughed within herself when she heard
[1:22:38] the brothers that had come over to speak
[1:22:40] with her husband's there they are again
[1:22:43] they come over they say they want to
[1:22:45] talk about the word and here the Abraham
[1:22:47] starts in telling him about I'm still
[1:22:49] gonna have a baby and there's tell him
[1:22:51] they're all saying amen to it
[1:22:52] what about me don't these men get it I'm
[1:22:58] too old and so was Abraham she was a
[1:23:02] woman Sarah and her spirit I'd hit
[1:23:08] poverty level she didn't feel like she
[1:23:10] was at the threshold of a promise no
[1:23:12] more but that she had passed it up the
[1:23:17] door had shut she was left outside a
[1:23:19] laughingstock to all around the emotions
[1:23:25] that were running through her or many
[1:23:29] disappointment this Korea
[1:23:32] angered the other women laughing you're
[1:23:41] so great Sara you can't even have one
[1:23:44] child I have had ten it was a major
[1:23:49] issue in their day they didn't want
[1:23:53] another dog they wanted children Genesis
[1:24:00] 18 and 13 and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:24:04] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[1:24:08] have a surety bear child which I'm old
[1:24:10] God was not discerning her condition as
[1:24:14] a stern rebuke he was telling Abraham my
[1:24:18] daughter's discouraged or in spirit all
[1:24:21] her senses are telling her it's too late
[1:24:23] and there's nothing I can do about it in
[1:24:25] verse 14 he says is there anything too
[1:24:30] hard for the Lord
[1:24:32] at that time appointed I will return
[1:24:35] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:24:38] and Sarah shall have a son a woman
[1:24:44] discouragement a woman with no hope and
[1:24:52] God takes it all in his control Amy it's
[1:24:56] not up to you Sarah you're a chosen
[1:24:59] vessel to receive this promise it's not
[1:25:03] up to you Sarah the Lord was a promise
[1:25:08] so close reminded them blessed are the
[1:25:13] poor in spirit when you let me have full
[1:25:18] control you're going through a struggle
[1:25:23] school work family husband wife children
[1:25:35] bless that are you in this heart trial
[1:25:39] when you let him have full control
[1:25:42] blessed are you in this hard trial when
[1:25:46] you let him have full control it's okay
[1:25:53] to say don't you understand pastor I
[1:25:55] can't do it
[1:25:58] the pastor raises up perfect because he
[1:26:03] can now give him full control Genesis 18
[1:26:13] 15 then Sarah denied that's when you
[1:26:18] know a brother and sister are poor in
[1:26:23] spirit and beaten down when you asked
[1:26:27] him did you say this they tell you I did
[1:26:29] not they're lying to you but I did say a
[1:26:37] brother or sister if you're mature
[1:26:43] enough to handle it you can't you'll
[1:26:49] still regard him your brother and sister
[1:26:50] if you're mature enough to handle it
[1:26:53] you'll still love them if you're mature
[1:26:56] enough to handle it you will wait you
[1:27:00] won't dump all your guns on them you'll
[1:27:04] say is that so brother yes that's all
[1:27:07] very good then we'll just let it sit
[1:27:10] there for now you say you're pulling
[1:27:16] back also to give God full control of
[1:27:19] their hearts and minds you don't think
[1:27:22] they feel condemned the minute they told
[1:27:24] you that you don't think it brought it
[1:27:28] brings them more pain that night as
[1:27:29] they're thinking about what they told
[1:27:31] you
[1:27:37] but you did the right thing you stop for
[1:27:42] a moment and you let God have control
[1:27:49] then Sarah denied saying I laughed not
[1:27:53] for she was afraid she was discouraged
[1:27:58] hmm she was afraid
[1:28:04] it caused it to lose hope it caused her
[1:28:08] to lie and all the time a daughter of
[1:28:12] God ordained to the promise of God yes
[1:28:16] that was the first time this woman born
[1:28:20] spirit laughed but it would not be the
[1:28:24] last Genesis 21 and verse 1 and the Lord
[1:28:29] visited Sarah as he had said and the
[1:28:31] Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for
[1:28:34] Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son
[1:28:38] in his old age at the set time of which
[1:28:41] God had spoken to him God always keeps
[1:28:48] his word to his children and Abraham
[1:28:52] called the name of his son that was born
[1:28:54] unto Him whom Sarah bore to him Isaac
[1:28:57] and Abraham circumcised the son Isaac
[1:29:00] being 8 days old as God had commanded
[1:29:01] him and Abraham was in a hundred years
[1:29:05] old when his son was born unto Him verse
[1:29:10] six of Genesis 21 and Sarah sat down God
[1:29:17] hath made me to laugh so that all that
[1:29:21] hear will laugh with me there was a time
[1:29:27] when she couldn't hardly come to church
[1:29:30] she said they're just laughing at me I
[1:29:34] greet the sister and shake her hand
[1:29:36] first thing that sister does give me a
[1:29:37] smile she's laughing at me she's
[1:29:40] laughing at me the brother came to mind
[1:29:43] said God bless you said good to see you
[1:29:45] can he's smiling and I could see if I
[1:29:48] can see right through him he's laughing
[1:29:49] at me
[1:29:50] that's all she could see they're
[1:29:53] laughing at me but when God brought the
[1:29:57] promise to pass she said God had made me
[1:30:03] to laugh again
[1:30:04] so that all that hear me will laugh with
[1:30:07] me now the sister shakes her hand she
[1:30:10] laughs oh you give her a hug she's
[1:30:12] laughing with me who changed Sara
[1:30:19] changed who was transformed
[1:30:22] Sara was transformed who was quickened
[1:30:24] Sarah was quickened
[1:30:27] so now though all that laughs laughs
[1:30:32] with her and she said who would who
[1:30:38] would have said unto Abraham that Sarah
[1:30:40] she should have given children suck for
[1:30:44] I have borne him a son in his old age I
[1:30:51] have borne him a son in his old age and
[1:30:56] to this spot in the sermon this morning
[1:30:58] as we're speaking the Lord Jesus has
[1:31:04] given me a discernment of the condition
[1:31:07] this church is in Bellotti I could tell
[1:31:13] you one at a time and stand you up or I
[1:31:17] could do you one at a time one at a time
[1:31:20] or all at once because of what's taking
[1:31:25] place here I can tell you where you are
[1:31:31] in this Exodus journey by this contents
[1:31:36] of Matthew 5:48 unfolding now and
[1:31:40] dovetailing it with the Old Testament I
[1:31:44] know just where you are in your
[1:31:46] Christian walk each and every one of you
[1:31:51] who shall I choose this morning to show
[1:31:55] you I speak truth
[1:31:58] whoo but my friend brother blockade
[1:32:02] brother blah pay in the name of the Lord
[1:32:06] Jesus Christ I tell you in your
[1:32:08] Christian journey in this Exodus walk
[1:32:10] like Sarah you are somewhere between the
[1:32:14] first and the last in his mercy anyone
[1:33:39] somewhat between the first lab and the
[1:33:43] man praise the Lord amen
[1:33:47] my goodness we want to thank the Lord I
[1:33:51] don't know what to say this morning that
[1:33:55] I know it is true that the Lord Jesus
[1:34:07] praise the Lord
[1:34:09] one thing that I noticed truth is that
[1:34:11] the Lord Jesus loved you and he sent
[1:34:15] brother Daniel to tell you you were
[1:34:16] right between your first line and the
[1:34:19] last line
[1:34:21] praise the Lord
[1:34:24] amen you know yesterday evening there
[1:34:29] was some few brothers they were having
[1:34:32] the Bible study in from dear
[1:34:34] but Moses brother Dan
[1:34:37] Ariel for a year on a myself I slid in
[1:34:42] and now you know we were just you know
[1:34:45] just talking some some structural things
[1:34:48] in it was it was good he meant it was
[1:34:52] going to see the brother sit in the only
[1:34:54] I mean we had a Bible in Emmy we were
[1:34:57] just calling in it interest and just
[1:34:59] chilling those Patriots prays alone
[1:35:01] sometimes it's good to have the Bible
[1:35:04] speaking for itself
[1:35:05] praise the Lord but what a basically
[1:35:09] like this morning I mean it almost took
[1:35:11] me off my seat you know if it was those
[1:35:15] days you are seeing something different
[1:35:17] I would have taken off my coat and truly
[1:35:19] get across the pulpit when I used to be
[1:35:23] radically because how how when we were
[1:35:33] just talking basically centered around
[1:35:37] Matthew 28:19
[1:35:45] just those things of Jesus our
[1:35:49] conversation was centered around how on
[1:35:52] earth how on earth that the preacher who
[1:35:59] come flew in yesterday come to the
[1:36:03] spooky this morning and go right to that
[1:36:07] scripture how it's a sign that God was
[1:36:15] pleased with our conversations amen and
[1:36:21] he just came back to tell us look you
[1:36:23] guys were talking something that was a
[1:36:25] parable oh I just enjoyed that I could
[1:36:31] not focus this morning my mind was just
[1:36:33] growing my goodness praise the Lord I
[1:36:38] just call him focus this morning
[1:36:41] something was just happening inside of
[1:36:43] me man when you see God coming on the
[1:36:47] scene like that I don't know when you
[1:36:51] you know what you waiting for to see God
[1:36:53] but when he comes on the scene like that
[1:36:56] my goodness and I don't know what I
[1:37:01] don't know what happened to the rest of
[1:37:03] the brothers I just know what happened
[1:37:04] to me amen praise the Lord amen and I
[1:37:12] think that I'm closer to the last life
[1:37:14] than the first life I'm somewhere in
[1:37:18] between but I'm more closer to the last
[1:37:21] life than the first life I tell you that
[1:37:25] was a petty sermon praise the Lord
[1:37:30] amen you know when you come to church
[1:37:33] and you are not afraid to be discerned
[1:37:38] praise the Lord is a sign that we don't
[1:37:41] have nothing to hide
[1:37:42] but we want to thank the Lord this
[1:37:44] morning musicians you can count four

[1:39:36] that God was going to use to bring the
[1:39:39] promise she had to be despised she had
[1:39:43] to be laughing at the very one and not
[1:39:49] only what people say
