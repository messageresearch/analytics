Jesus Christ amen amen the Lord bless your sins I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's a privilege to be in your midst again but so that I don't keep you standing for too long I will invite you to let's reach the scriptures thereafter you take the comfort of your seats and we trust that the Lord will help us there from amen amen if you have your Bibles with you please stand with me to the Book of Luke chapter 2. Luke Chapter 2 . I would like to read from the 21st verse to 38th verse and also connect with Luke chapter 18. if you are there Say Amen and when eight days we accomplished for the circumcision of the child his name was called Jesus which was so named of the Angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of our purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord as it is written in the law of the Lord every male that hope under the womb Shall be Called holy to the Lord and to offer his sacrifice according to that which he said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devote waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had sinned the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let thou thy servants depart him peace according to Thy Word for mine eyes I've seen thy salvation which that was prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel and Joseph and his mother marveled are those things which were spoken of him and Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary's mother behold this child is set for the Fallen Rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yeah a salt shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed and there was one honor a prophetess the daughter of fanuel of the tribe of Usher she was of a great age and had lived with an husband seven years from a virginity and she was a widow of about First Call in four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord and speak of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem amen Luke chapter 18 sorry bear with me Luke 18 verse 18. 2 30. and a certain ruler asked him that's Verse 18 now Luke 18 18. and a certain ruler asked him saying good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou May good none is good save one that is God thou knows the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and he said all these have I kept from my youth up now when Jesus adds these things he said unto him yet one thing sell all the thou has and distribute unto the poor and thou shall have treasure in heaven and come follow me and when he had and when he had these he was very sorrowful for it was very rich and when Jesus saw that it was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God for it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God and did I heard it said who then can be saved and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with God how many believe that then Peter said Lo we have left all and follow thee and he said unto them verily I see unto you there is no man that had left house or parents or Brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God's sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life Everlasting may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his holy war amen God bless you you may please be seated once again I would like to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and I also represent or bring the greetings of the Saints back in Nigeria that's of the church where I identify wheat and also that of my family and everyone who at least maybe not know all of you but know your pastor because he was formerly a Nigerian before it was first in Liberia and then it became a Nigerian and now he's an American so we want to thank the Lord for him amen so everyone sends greetings and I want to thank the Lord for making it possible for me to be here at this time by my change of program I thought it wasn't going to work out again but Pastor here was insistence and somehow were able to adjust the program so I want to appreciate him very well for his love and for extending this arm of Fellowship to me yeah I appreciate you sir and I appreciate also the privilege to see all of you again amen when I saw my friends before they were just new couple now they've graduated I guess yeah and they are looking like graduates from just being married couples to parents now and we are thankful to God for that it's the goodness of the Lord and I pray that that which the Lord has begun will be permanent I am so happy to see all of you I also graduated since the last time I came here I graduated from being parents to be grandparents so the Lord has been so good to all of us and I pray you continue to do that amen so I'm so happy to be in your midst tonight I came into the U.S was uh today's Wednesday Monday night and I flew into Washington so spend a day with the Saints there before traveling down today and they told me also to pass their greetings to the Believers here so we're glad I'm so glad to be here tonight and it was just laid upon my heart to speak on the subject of expectation I do not know if I've ever spoken on that year before but this is what the Lord has placed upon my heart tonight and I believe it will reinforce the blessings of the weekends that I missed yeah but here in the pastor talking about it I believe that something very good must have taken place and if that happened I believe since I have an expectation uh blessings some fall out of those meetings so I'm just here tonight to reinforce that in your heart yeah the it's a great thing to have expectation and I'm glad to see my landlady just in case you don't know this is my first landlady in Minnesota many years ago amen and I appreciate all of you thank you for everything so tonight we'll be speaking on expectation and the first thought I would like for us to know is that Christianity itself is based on the expectation uh we are not in a relationship with God that looks like uh God if you rub my back I will rob yours that is not exactly so Christianity is a if you cannot scratch my back I will still scratch yours anyway if it is necessary so we are not doing things for selfish motives we are not doing things to even get something back in return amen we have Revelations like the three Hebrew children and until your Christianity come to such level you are still an off-bed plant the Hebrew children knew the ability of God they know what God can do but they also have the revelation of the sovereignty of God it is not everything God can do that he is willing to do at every time and it will never change him from being God that was why they could tell Nebuchadnezzar they say oh King live forever he said will not bow down to your image we know our God yes can deliver us so the ability of God is not in doubt yes to the Believers but they also told the king in case he chooses not to not because he cannot right but he may choose not to like the prophet said is yes and his nose they are the same thing to the believer yet we will still not bow down to your image amen so they have tall expectations of God's ability but they are not expecting it like uh uh if you do me this I would do you that I pray the spirit of the Lord will expand that in your heart but nevertheless Christianity has something in it for every believer praise the Lord Apostle Paul said if it is only in this life that you and I have hope hey bro of Willie God bless you I'm just seeing them one after the other God bless you my sister he said if it is only in this life I'm proceed those are our grandparents if it is only in this life that you and I have hope we have all men the most miserable amen so in other words our coming every night Define the odds coming every Sunday when there are other things we could have busy ourselves with is not going to be for nothing there are blessings there are reward for it and I'm yet to encourage you tonight because we are living at a time that the Bible said that day of the Lord will not come until there be a falling away first and a lot of Crash is coming up here and there and they could be very discouraging but in the midst of this we must still strengthen that which remains and one of the ways to strengthen that which remains is to refresh yes the hope that make it not ashamed so I'm here to tell you tonight that for all your Christian sacrifices label worship consecration there is something in it for you [Applause] so don't be tired of your worship you know God told the prophet he said if only you knew what lays ahead it's like keep pressing on keep pressing on so my message to the church tonight is keep pressing on because there is something great ahead for you and I the Journey of a Christian Life when God started it with Abraham started as a journey of expectation you know why God never told Abraham where he was taken him right he only told him he said pack your bags and everything that would be our modern language and start going to a place that I will show you if you told that to your neighbor your neighbor will tell you calm down wait till you are shown so you can put it on Google Map and it gives you direction to the place is that right but Abraham never waited till he was shown he packed this bag he came to the junction I was trusting God for the next turn yes and wherever it's going to be he didn't know what it held for him but you see it's a Journey of Faith yeah and it was expecting that God would take care of things for him amen and you see Abraham was so convinced of God's ability to take care of his instruction to him until the Bible said it came to a conclusion that he was looking for a city the Arts Foundation whose Builder and maker is God and because of the strength of that expectation in his heart he never minded living like a pilgrim in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 he said there that says such things in other words they that kid into Abraham's lifestyle into Abraham's faith into Abraham's kind of expectation he said that we are saying it all about that we are looking for a city and there were so many things that came along their way as a challenge so many experiences until the Bible says those experiences were strong enough for them to use as an excuse to go back if they are not mindful of where they are going now where they were going was a journey of expectation because they couldn't even show it to another person are you catching it so and that expectation influenced their living they lived as pilgrims they lived as strangers yet they were not poor or frustrated but in the midst of the achievement wealth and success they never dig deep they never relaxed on age because they have a hope of a better country and that is the way we are going to live also if this expectation becomes a revelation in our hearts tonight I'm serving God because I also have expectations I know they'll be a rapture and I'm expecting it I know there will be a wedding supper and I'm expecting it I know there will be a millennium and I'm expecting it I know there will be an eternal living in a Four Square City in a city that John saw coming down and I'm expecting it all these things are propelling my desire to serve God's the more he said let others seek at home below I feel like traveling on I might not be able to show it to somebody else but it is real to me that this thing exists and why would I expect because somebody promised me and I know the strength of Israel can never lie and that is why I wouldn't need anybody to push me amen I'm already pushed by my expectation I wouldn't need anybody to encourage me to come to church I will come to church I will serve him I will walk in the light I will abide in the truth I will make my banner clear I will let my moderation to be known to all men I will tell it to everybody that the Lord is at hand because I'm expecting [Music] if this hope is in your heart also you will do the same live like a pilgrim you will live like a stranger when you have dull or slow moments those things will come to your mind and it will refresh your heart to keep serving the lord you say how do you know that was what he did for others this sense we are talking about they were mere mortals just like we were the Bible said Elijah was a man of like passion just as we are meaning that he has his moments of appointment he has his moments of disappointment but something kept them going whatever kept them going can keep us going because he's the same yesterday today and forever they had moment to be discouraged they saw bread and also fell away Paul told us of edemas who was so fervent amen who forsook him but in all these things Paul never went back that's right so we will suffer from him for a second who will suffer rejection that's right just as they did but something must keep you going and what will keep you going is expectation if you love him tonight I hope I'm simple enough as you have expectation God also has expectation amen God is expecting to see a church without sport without the wrinkle a glorious church until sin cannot abide in it amen the prophet said the spirit of the Lord is calling for that wherever it is there will be a generation that will meet that desire amen nature Housewives expectation according to the scriptures Romans chapter 5 told us that the Earth is groaning amen who is it grown into is not grown into God it's grown into you you know why because the Earth knew how it was before the fall yes right in the dispensation of Innocence imperfection and the Earth feels that I've enjoyed the two sides I feel more comfortable with this one so the Earth is groaning for a restoration yeah because there will be one he's going for a restoration of that Perfection that's right the prophet said the Earth is tired of sucking innocent blood it starts of the violence the perversion that has taken over the Earth and they wanted a restoration back to the original beginning that's right and the Earth knew that they will never get back to that beginning you think nature does not know some things nature new and still does nature didn't fall nature is only suffering from our fall that is why the trees are still bearing their fruits in their season right amen if you studied nature very well animals have never changed their disposition we are the one that got out of our range yes if we get back to our range lion will bow to us he will not charge at us Amen in terms of everything Anatomy about animal even to the appropriation style it still has God left it it's only men that moved out of range when you study the scriptures when you studied the message so that is why nature still held its originality and they knew what will take him back to the Bliss the comfort in one's art and that is why they are groaning for what to see the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God it is you being restored that will bring peace yes Back To Nature yes so nature also has expectation husbands could have expectation of why of their wives the wives will have expectation of husbands right right the children will have expectations of parents and it goes on and on and on and on like that amen may the Lord help us but let me say something the prophet said the first rule of expectation is that every man will get what he expects that means the lesson of that is that in expecting we must remain positive if you expect to see something negative you will get it brother Brahm said don't ever allow the devil to point an accusing finger at me to you in the message whoever true Prophet is that if you allow him he will show you plenty but those plenty things you are seeing they are pure Mirage they actually don't exist but your spiritual eye pigments could be programmed to see things that are not there because physically you see sometimes things that don't exist right you are traveling on the road amen and you look ahead of you and you lose as if you are seeing water flooding the road but you keep traveling towards the water there was no water but your eyes is telling you there's something that looks like water and English people are science call it a mirage something that looks real but it's not existing yeah and also the prophet said the devil can paint a picture I make it so real but it's not actually existing so if you are wired to expect negative you will see things that are negative but they are not real this is why the prophet said don't ever ever be negative always be positive let me tell you for you to have expectation God appreciate it and they will never deny you even sometimes if it takes you asking God for some confirmation he knows how it feels because God knows where he has taken each of us this takes me to the second scripture where we read I will start from the second scripture before I come to the first we read a scenario that doesn't look like our subjects but let me bring that money for you the Bible spoke of a Rich Young Ruler here that's what Rich Young Ruler Summers arises every human achievement people want to be rich when they get money they also want Power when they get power they want to have enough years to enjoy their status that is why they struggle is so much when you are young if you are serious but let me tell you you could have all these things and by the time you have them you will still feel empty you will still feel unsatisfied because this is not the Pinnacle of achievement and that was why this man was young rich powerful a ruler so his God wealth he's got power and his God age working for him amen but despite all this great credential of achievement something in his heart tells him something is still missing that void can only be filled with eternal life so with all your getting tonight I want you to get eternal life amen if you are not if you don't readily have it you must be born again look that gospel can never go out of fashion it is the essence of your life if only life you have is the natural flesh life your expectation is short your expectations will be caught short because job said a man that is born of woman is full of troubles and a few days mind it's a life of crisis it's a life that is not worth celebrating I tell people birthday celebration only makes sense if you have been Reborn because without that you are just celebrating failure and death oh yes that's scriptural you love him tonight so this guy had everything but despite all that it was constantly filled having a feeling of avoiding him yeah so he kept running elter scatter from church to church from religion to religion it wasn't a bad guy I want you to get the foundation he was a good church boy he never lived a reckless life no no it was somebody right from his youth you know that gave himself committed himself to religion amen amen but despite religious commitment and religious achievement physical achievement political achievement everything achievement which it got loved by fraudulent means I'll prove that by the scripture he still has this void in his heart that he needed something more and he had an opportunity to come in contact with the solution one day and as a good Master what must I do to be saved and the good Master said go observe the law you know what the law says the good Master knew his need but for your sake he wanted to start the journey with him from somewhere so we can learn a lesson it started with him from religion and that guy said you know master from my youth up he never had a Reckless Youth age right I have kept all these things and the whole scene high before um nothing could be hidden right looked into that life penetrated his entire being and he said he was telling the truth yeah yeah if you stood here tonight his credential will be better than some of us right without getting saying this is how far religion can take you and I and yet we still don't have it right so let's think on our ways tonight there was a young boy in the church when in the Church of the Prophet under the pastorship of brother Abraham the prophet said this guy was so good he's taking his position in the church it became even a good influence a reference point that you can say don't you see this young man but when it started you know into marriage is inadequacy became open something will always expose you so don't assume make sure are you with me Brethren I'm not preaching a straight jacket it's the seventh seal so it touches here and there for those who might be wondering is this part of expectation it is part of expectation praise the Lord and I have Sunday so if I don't finish tonight I will continue don't worry amen the essence is that you must get the canals amen he started a relationship and during courtship they realized that he will promise to do something for that girl okay maybe I'll help you stop over this and that there are many things you could make promises about and you are not able to do it but how you handle it is important yes he wouldn't even be able to say sorry it was like a it was like a song who never learns the virtue of apology it will only give you reasons why he cannot do the right thing reasons we may learn from but it doesn't take care of repentance are you catching it all right then the prophet that the parents at some point became concerned and they came to the prophet what is wrong with our boy and the prophet looked at that boy's life despite his religious Church credentials he said what he needs it might be a good boy in the church but in his regeneration do you know the parent protested that if they say we know our boy he's a Christian brother Brahm said it's always unpopular if you have to take this position for somebody who had said amen to every word in the church who is trying to live a good life he was trying to you know be civil do everything around and you come back and said he is not yet converted he said but if you want to hear the truth that's the condition of the boy then he traced it to you know genetic traits that are passed them from parents it's not only sickness or disease that are passed down characters are also passed down so genetics as the physical and the spiritual aspect you know and I said you you are like this your wife was like this when you break this boy you bred him in your body so the natural traits from you and your wife came into this boy now what made the change for you today is because you have met Christ the same way you met Christ that young man has got to admit Christ and make sure he does before going into marriage otherwise it will make hell for that guy I so we can be churchy but not converted so this is the case of the Rich Young Ruler he has observed all the law but I see what God demanded was the righteousness that surpasses that of the Pharisee Pharisees righteousness is almost impeccable it goes far said as touching the law I am blameless a Pharisee of the Pharisee and yet he wasn't a Christian read your Bible is that he couldn't even recognize his day and his message he was still persecuting Christians so this Rich Young Ruler had a tall credential and when he said he has observed all those things the eye of God looked into his life and said yes you've done that because when that high examine his life he finds just one thing left is that your problem is not any of these things your problem is that your wealth you will never want to give up anything for this money that is what you worship right yours may not be that God dealt with him personally yours may not be money yours may be something else but anything you don't feel like giving up even at the risk of God that is your snare amen that is that thing that you must actually overcome but because he had so many possessions many possessions are not always the money alone bad habits could be your possession and you can fill in the gap and you feel the cost of giving it up is too great for Christ nothing must contend with Christ in our life there's anything that ever comes in contention even for comparison that is the god you presently serve in that nature that God has got to die because God is not going to married a married woman with a living husband right because it's not a b it's not going to Fellowship in adultery that is why it demands the death of that nature to free you from the headship of that nature and make you a single person again worthy for his own marriage because God is never going to join himself into adultery and that is the reason many of us are in the church but we are not converted we don't receive Christ we could observe our religion do many things but we are not still ready to let go Christ will never break his principle for nobody he said brother Brahm said many wanted him to lure it to accommodate their lifestyle he said but no he's going to raise it and you must rise you love him to him going good for my young friends yeah I'm taking time because I see young folks here amen the Lord bless you amen so when God told him this is what you need to do the Bible said the cost was great for him so he left he would rather choose his wealth and reject Christ now everybody thought when this man rejected Christ since with nose die for him but you make mistakes sometimes if it happens it reject Christ it will get more wealth yeah are you hearing me I say it with all sense of responsibility it wouldn't tamper with anything the only person God goes after is his own seat praise the Lord it makes life you know so difficult for you till you find him a necessary necessity the prophet said it would do everything equivalent lay you on the bed of sickness until you call for Spiritual Daddy call Daddy now I want to make it all right amen so if he's not after you you should be sorry for yourself the Bible told us Ken went out of the presence of the Lord did God run after him no he left him he even put a mark on him so that nobody will hurt him right but Kane lived and he lived a terrible life till he left but there was a Jonah who ran from God's presence and God said this one I'm going after him because he must bring all his sons unto glory and the beginning of their glory is to bring them to conform first with his will so he's not going to give up on you he's not going to leave you right you say It's my life I want to leave it no you make a mistake it's not your life he gave you that life and the one who manufactures a product is the one who has a right to determine the purpose of that product you were born out unnecessarily until you have this Revelation and submit to it so when this guy left you see the disciples the rest we are watching the scenario and they were wondering yeah you say he's going to have life tough but he never had it off brother Brahm said he was the same guy that the Lord pictured as coming to a point of too much wealth and it all his own soul relax enjoy you have so much he was the same guy that was pictured with Lazarus yeah that's according to the message of the hour amen that couldn't even return good virtues again it became so numb until it cannot even give Comfort to any support to Lazarus he must have told Lazarus if I follow that your Jesus I would have ended up like you are right everything around them reinforce the need for him to reject Christ but it was getting richer and richer yeah when the disciples when they saw this they became confused sure because they also had a background Follow Me Now it's going to harmonize for our subject now they also had a background uh everybody that God ever brings to himself as a background and what Christ demanded of that Rich Young Ruler is exactly what is demanding of every child that comes to God you must be willing to forsake one thing or the other right are you with me yes yes you must be willing to give up something for the sake of the Kingdom so they knew their own background they knew what they gave off when they didn't see this man suffering for his rejection they had to come to Christ you know they must have pushed me to ask the question pop it up to him because we need some Assurance now right and that was why Peter came to ask sir the background is that this Rich wrong ruler was offered the same invitation like you offered us he rejected you and yet nothing seemed to tamper with him he's going fine but you know sir where we are coming from Lord we have left all yes what is going to be in there for us yeah now somebody may expect that to be a canal question but until you understand we are Peter and the rest are coming from you will not appreciate their question but the one they were asking the Lord knew it the impression many of us had was that Peter and the rest of them maybe they were poor frustrated people you will struggle to have a scripture for that right did you did you hear me you will struggle to have a scripture for that yeah I want to tell you tonight that Peter was wealthy and I will prove it by the scripture I want to tell you tonight that James and John was wealthy Matthew was a career tax officer yes yes all of them had great things going on for them in life what the scripture told of Peter and some was that they were ignorant and on lineage not being educated is different from not being wealthy it's got nothing to do together in my own country the African richest billionaire had no education if if ad education it didn't go past the secondary school education but today he employed phds and professors and his wealth is in billions of dollars is the richest African and I think number six or so in the world so being rich and being educated through different things so what the Bible chose is what he said they are ignorant and non-learned he never told you that they are poor [Music] you want me to prove it to you let's take a little proof can you please put Luke Chapter 5 on the board for us let's take a little proof because I want you to see the power of expectation when Peter asked that question are they putting it for us when Peter asked that question Lord we have left all he meant every sense of that word and Jesus who understood never rebuked Peter it is a case of Peter I understand nobody ever leaves anything for me what Jesus realized was that these people wanted something yeah to expect to look up to for all their sacrifices their choice that they have made they wanted to be sure that they had not been defrauded they wanted to be sure of the outcome of their Investments and Christ has to offer that because Christianity is based on expectation when the revelation of what we at trespect becomes clear to us it makes the journey easy for us to walk I tell you friends you wouldn't even need a pastor to be prodding you all the time you will give your all to him because you know at the end of the road you aren't going to exchange this Old Rugged life for nothing and that was why Christ said the reward is not going to be on earth alone so there's a reward on Earth yes yes for serving the lord let's do it Faithfully my brother let's do it Faithfully my sister be encouraged tonight amen yes I'm beyond time there's a greater reward up there that is what our lord said let's say the background from Peter sorry bring it for us and they came to pass let's enjoy this scripture and they came to pass that as the people pressed upon him that's upon the Lord to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of janessaret uh-huh and so to what two ships now he didn't say quinoa he didn't say a boat no no the Bible has used the word kennel in the scripture he has used boats in the scripture he's using sheep now so it's not playing with words it's the size of each equipment that determines their name now even if it's a kennel today can a poor manhole maybe some of you don't know what we call Kennels because you are the advanced country all right but at least you know both speed boats and everything you know that one yeah is it the proper can that be a property of a poor person you need some good money to buy a boat even if it's a small size isn't it yes all right we're going to see the owners of this ship now and ship is bigger than both both is bigger more sophisticated than kennels right boats are engine engine powered and ship is large size it could be a trawler it could be for containers depending on the size but at whatever level is not a property of a poor man how many agree with that all right so let's see the owners of these ones and we'll determine whether they are rich or poor and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen we are going out of them and we are washing their nets all right and he entered into one of the ships which was ooze this is Simon Peter here now so Simon Peter had a ship he owned a ship was he a poor man God bless you so am I proving my case he owned a ship and anytime you travel to Israel uh tell your guide to take you to capanum and show you the evidence of Peter's house when they did archaeological excavation they brought out the old materials the materialization materials which which Peter built his house because the materials for your house determines your level of wealth in Israel they said if if the house is built with dark colored stones it shows you an average or poor person but if it's built with white granite Stones it shows you a wealthy man of standing at that time and when they excavated Peter's house the same place where Jesus healed the Mother-in-law in the Bible the other excavation remains shows white granite Stones so even the guide told us that Peter was a wealthy man yes this is the evidence so I'm giving you from archaeological point and I'm giving you from scriptural point and prayed him that he will trust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship at this time Peter was not yet following Christ this was to be his conversion now followed let's go on the next line now when he had left speaking Peter was having a bad business day with his friends at this time they owned their ship they know what their ship should carry their Nets and so forth but this particular day they've done they've got nothing but in their frustration in their disappointment our Lord came around as if he never knew what has happened to them all day right but something connected with them because they have the siege Gem of God in their heart and somebody just came around he didn't know what you've been through all day I say can I use your can I just use your ship to do you say I don't need the entrance I just need the brain area I want to stand there and preach my gospel yeah if you are not careful you will miss your visitation yes right so what are you talking about do you know what what I've been through all day come on you must learn to rise above your frustration brother Brahm said Abraham was able to have a visitation of the Angel and you know give them a welcome because he rose above his situation Abraham was having family situation according to the reveal world that tells us truth hidden between the lines amen he was having a family situation he said you know the the frustrations and the disappointments of the day was taken to Allah we are sons of God here can I come for you a little amen was taken toll on Mama Sarah and she was kind of having it rough and venting it upon Abraham why was inventing this on Abraham Abraham made the most honorable Christian righteous choice but because the results were not coming as a result of that choice wasn't taking it easy it would be like look at you now you made Lord who he was you brought him out and when it comes to a time to make a choice you gave that young boy the rights to choose first he chose the nice place all the reports he's receiving is good business multiplying his expansion everything but you hear in the desert an old man with not enough maybe not enough signs to know what to do see what all the workers are saying they said it's all dry everything the cartoons are dying the businesses are not doing well because of your poor choice and Abraham was coming from a spiritual assemble you know mama I waited upon God to make the witch God did you wear up on and the prophet said when things were getting real tight Abraham said the best thing for me to do is to use a bypassity leader and they say you know what was happening it was the devil bringing his scarecrow to make him miss his visitation yes but Abram Rose above that by bypassing that and that is what sons of God must do he was the son of God enough to know how to retain the right atmosphere you must do that in your homes brother Brahma is a prophet listen to me with the Angelic visitation all the time is that sometimes I don't beat my house the way I left it right he said I come back into the house and everything looks upside down I would say once it affects the Earth it comes upon the children yes the prophet taught that he said because uh Mama media has been affected he said the children are also all over the places fighting crying doing all kind those things are not natural God wants the right atmospheres in our homes he said when I come in the first challenge I have as a Son of God is to check that Checkmate that invader ah you don't check mate and Invader with an instrument that is not in God's Armory he has the wisdom of the Son of God enough to know that the woman had come under intense pressure so she never attacked Mida he attacked the spirit even if you have to offer correction correction only thrives in the right atmosphere so he said I take the challenge to send the devil out then rescue my family then provide leadership so he said I'm madly able to boil water not to talk of cooking but I start doing things to bring back the smile yeah you tell me that I said ah how are you I said leave me alone there I don't have time for you and I said okay you know what I saw a dress right at the shop there I think it should be so nice that whatever cause let's go get it I don't need your dress I said okay what do I do he said I start getting the children wash them clean them up get to the kitchen try to tidy up things do they say when I'm doing that I'm looking at her face and gradually the smile is coming back is uh that makes me say no that makes you a Christian I'm not teaching you American lifestyle I'm teaching you Kingdom principles you must be first a child of God yes yes remember before in fact there is nothing good to learn about any country yeah all countries habits are substandard yeah to our own habit as Believers take it or leave it if you leave as an American you won't make it yeah you leave us in Nigeria you won't make it you leave us any Nation Under Heaven you won't make it right they don't have the quality or the standard of life that is required of a peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood they don't have it so shaker from this habit get into the habit of the world and you're going to live right is that by the time I'm doing that the devil is becoming uncomfortable I'm doing what I'm sending them out and the smile is beginning to return to my wife's face until you will say are you sure the shop will have closed can we go and get the clothes now right right then I know that I've checked that guy out if he's going to correct sister me there that correction will sink in at that time sons of God may he Grant you his wisdom to put the right atmosphere in your house so this Brethren Rose above their death frustration some of you maybe you have shops who have businesses you have to rise above it above your business to come to the house of the Lord tonight because sometimes the way the devil does is to bring more business right about the service time yeah we feel that in Africa you what you've said people have stayed all day in their shops nothing is selling right around coming to service time you'll be seeing volumes of traffic so you've got to rise above that or say look I must close this shop to go and mind my soul and let me tell you if you do that you've done honorable things you've placed the kingdom of God first nothing would you lose God will repay it back for you this was the condition of these folks here they've done no good business a day then somebody suddenly came as if he never knew say can I just use your so insensitive I need you know I don't need you in touch I just need this person I want to preach these guys must have look at himself it doesn't mean anything to us if it's not using it we are doing nothing if we use it it doesn't change anything Mr Man use and preach so after finishing the salmon please bring back my scripture amen amen are you enjoying the law what time do you closer oh no they don't want to be honest with me now all right I will go ahead until I feel uncomfortable thank you for thank you for your gesture now when he had left speaking is said unto Simon Jesus knows your cares friends amen it knows your sacrifices he knows just what it feels whether you pray unto him on Earth it knows your need can your faith rise up to a level tonight yes let me give you a scripture do you know what if you seek the kingdom of God first and it's righteousness whether you pray for your needs or not it is automatic that God must give you that's according to the scripture he said do not be anxious for nothing he said your heavenly fathers knows what you need it is the even that dies of anxiety but no child of God will be withhold anything good she faced the kingdom of God and his righteousness all other things am I cutting the scripture we be added to him so whether you pray for other things or not our lord said your heavenly father knows that you need those things come on George the one for whom they gave the right of way it's not going to respond it's a lounge out into the deep and let down your net for a drought if you look abroads the old meaning is an Old English word which means great multitude of others so in this case is going to be great multitude of fishes are you with me yes lunch into the deep and let down your net for what a draft let's hear the response and Simon answer and said unto him master we have towed all night and I've taken nothing as you see us we are not straight fishermen we are born fishermen right right train you understand we didn't Veer into this it's our life there's a difference between somebody who is naturally a fisherman and somebody who went to school just to be a fisherman we know when fishes are sleeping that's right we know when they are weak we know when they are playing we know when they annoyed we know when they're happy we have all the Dynamics and we can catch them and we've used all the skills we know from morning till now we caught nothing but there is something about you master nevertheless despite all this our experience as thy words so if they are relying on his words that means they are expecting to catch are you here because faith no expectation is aroused by faith and faith is provoked by a promise and the promise is accepted by your revelation of the ability of the one offering the promise let me make it simple if I tell our pastor here that I will buy you a tie and it looks like me and say yes he's able to do it will he not believe me he will believe me yeah do you understand this is the way to get Faith you must have the revelation of the ability of the one promising you if you believe that Christ can do all things it becomes easy for you to accept what he says that's how to build faith if maybe a little boy who doesn't have work maybe a five-year-old who doesn't do anything we'll come and tell pastor I will buy you a car did you catch that all of you are laughing you will find it difficult to believe because by your revelation of his ability he cannot do it is probably putting his parents Under Pressure now but by himself he cannot do it but if a man you know has the means say it is it's not difficult for you to accept and I'm telling you tonight Jesus has all the means foreign because even Peter trusted his word having just a fresh encounter with him and he said nevertheless other word I will let down the net and when he did I'm still not I'm not alive where I'm going but let's enjoy these are Sidelines seventh seal you know and when they had this done they enclosed I want you to underline that word the enclosed a great multitude of fishes what you enclose is what is not struggling scattering everywhere right because this is the way to enclose did you catch that you enclose it now you can only enclose what was waiting stationarily for you so meaning that even though there was no fish in the water the spoken word the creative word of God spoke fish in there and catch them there for these people to catch so they never struggle to catch these fishes and the Bible said fishes meaning because there's no plural for fish fish is fish even if they are one thousand but where you see a plural one like this it shows different species of fish so meaning this is not just tilapia this is not only heck this is not only Crocker this is not just catfish they write it by the creative power of him who spoke them into existence and they cut so big and their Nets break so this is the best business ever because it went beyond their capacity they've only they've always caught you know what their neck Nets could take but this time around God broke their neck so they made more fishes than they ever had in their life are you following not only that let's continue you will see where I'm going now and the beckoned onto their Partners which were in the order ship that there should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships yeah so that they began to sink this is God's business the blessings of the Lord that maketh rich and had no soul without any struggle without any labor just we're there to enclose and the god things that were more than their capacity business has never been this good for them all they have ever caught in their life is within the range of their sheep the size of their ship determines their cash but here our Lord came and said I will overrun your size I will exceed your expectation it's still the same yesterday today and forever when you begin to bless him first it's all pluses are no miners okay we are coming gradually to where I'm going all right when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees say depart from me for I'm a sinful man oh Lord it was to embarrass it's like saying that ah is this how you answer people's prayer even me I'm So Unworthy of this thing that you have done that's what Peter was expressing yeah isn't the Lord good to us let's watch the next line for it was astonished and all that were with him at the draft of the fishes which they had taken uh-huh go on and so also and so was also James we are seeing the identity of these Partners now and John the sons of zebedes they were first business partners before they become message partners because they were these same three guys that were going to get beautiful as they look on us are you catching it yeah so get good company and get it get companies that are positive that will be friends to Grace and not to disgrace mind your company mind your partnership amen all right which we are partners with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not watch it now from End sports thou shall catch men and let's see the next line what it says and when they had brought their ships to land what happened what happened what happened they did watch they forsook those big catch those large Revenue I don't know who sold the fishes eventually I don't know we enjoy the money but they forsook all and followed him at the peak highest peak of their business success that was when Christ demanded come follow me so was Christ asking the Rich Young Ruler anything different from what he has always demanded no sir so if the Rich Young Ruler had accepted him he would just have done his reasonable service he wouldn't have made much more sacrifice than others because at the greatest level of money Christ demanded for followership Peter James and John left everything and they followed him this was the backgrounds to their question in Luke 18. Lord's Master we have forsaken all this guy refused to forsake all he still has everything we have forsaken all we don't even mind our business again if you have a place to sleep we sleep if we don't have a place to sleep we just keep going with you for all the sacrifices that we have made what is going to be in there for us so that question was touchy to our Lord because he knew the background to it and that was why I said Peter I understand nobody ever forsake anything for me or for my namesake that will not get much more in this life or in the world to come I'm saying it affirmatively that Christianity must have something in it for us so be encouraged tonight you aren't going to exchange these old self-denial life with nothing God came to Matthew was a career a career officer professional he take taxes he records it it makes money for the government and everything Christ got on the queue one day seemingly looking like it was coming to pay his tax and they waited for his own town when the sun came Matthew must affects how much are you paying what's your Revenue let me calculate your taxes and you just look at you and say Matthew said sir gather from there and follow me a Matthew left all the money all the booklets all the records his career his gratuity his pension Everything plan he left or right there I'm for soup and followed Christ so if such people demanded of Christ what is going to be in it for us you think he will rebuke them he knew that they needed an uncle so if you need an uncle tonight God will give it to you and maybe this is the uncle you need tonight if you are in a state of despair if you're in a state of confusion whether look let me tell you keep pressing on yes if you only knew what lays ahead oh God bless yourself what am I proven Christianity thank you Christianity is based on expectation and we trust the one who has promised us amen he said he will never leave us he will never forsake us is there nothing you ever forsake for him in time will that God will never forget so Brethren a lord lays ahead do not allow the glamor of the world to do your senses to the beauty of Heaven amen can we go a little bit more is it okay to go a little bit more film okay if it's okay then let me come back to the scripture the second scripture quickly God gave her the second the second rule for that scripture is that the prophet said you must also have the revelation of what you are expecting because sometimes you know the people who were expecting the Messiah new deer will be a messiah but they never had the revelation of how the Messiah will come yeah in the message Discerning the body of the Lord I took one line very seriously he said our Eternal destination does not depend s on what we see what we hear even what we as preachers preach listen to me he said it's entirely dependent on the discernment the revelation we have of what we are seeing hearing and even preaching yeah you say is it possible to preach a thing without revelation absolutely yeah and I'll prove it to you tonight they call me Messiah was a sermon that started gaining prominence since the day of prophet Isaiah do you remember that a virgin shall conceive but do you know people do not have the revelation of the conception of a virgin there we are thinking that a virgin will be married a virgin but for how to conceive and bring forth a child she can no longer be a virgin she must be known to bring forth their child is that right but that's not the revelation of the words this version will not be known he will remain a virgin after conception he will remain a virgin after delivery she will still be a virgin yeah because she will still be Untouched by anybody that is the revelation but nobody knew that that was why when Angel Gabriel came down Mary who had long been the church and the Angels sing with her out and told her you are going to have he said how will these things be knowing that I know no man and to I was given the revelation of the plan the spirit of the Lord will overshadow you and this and that she adds that revelation but the reason these things was rejected in the church was because even the preacher did not have that revelation a virgin shall conceive use young ladies keep yourself who knows whether it's going to be among you and they were keeping themselves and one of those who was keeping themselves eventually conceived and they said no no no no no tell it to somebody else how can you say you conceive how can you say the preachers rejected us that's right rejecting their own Sermon Just the Same that's right but there was somebody whom God gave a revelation mom now you will not see death until you see the Lost Christ now I didn't know how God brought this promise to him but I have an idea of the way God does these things it might be that Simeon preached so much about the Messiah until God was impressed and excited about the sermon and say and you will have you will see the Messiah it may be so because when brother Brown preached about Joseph so much God looked at him one day and said you will have a Joseph amen I can say your passion on the delivery of Joseph in comparison to the Lord and it's it gets even with the Lord he said you have it yourself so maybe it is one of such but anyhow that man held tight to the promise I will not see death until I say the Lord's Christ and daily he was expecting daily he was preaching and let me tell you that expectation preserved Simeon yeah it was an old man so even if he was suffering from old age sicknesses no matter how profit God right he knew we never die I can imagine it will have been in ICU for many days sometimes blocked every life supports and everything and when they rebounded leader he said Doctor don't disturb yourself you know I can die that's right and the doctor always said the man is getting hysteric let's give him some shots to calm his nerves he said save yourself the trouble I have a promise until I see the Lost Christ let me tell you if you want to touch to a promise for your life it will preserve you the promise God gave Caleb preserved Caleb it's not that you won't get hurt listen to me but you wound up you will not be in a ship not to enjoy your promise Caleb was 85 years old when the promise of God was about to be fulfilled in his life but what was his testimony he said as my strength was at age 40 so is my strength now so age means nothing to carry off promises because your promise must preserve you and keep you in a condition to enjoy that is the power of expectation so you could imagine this day came when the Lord was going to fulfill it and you know what some people came you know for baby dedication and Joseph and Mary also came the moment they saw Joseph America now our own children are pedigree children these are the legislature child so we can't be on the same side so they must have gone this way leaving Joseph and Mary this way and Pastor Simeon came to the pulpit and said they told me today we're going to have some baby dedication so while they sing bring them and bring them in let's have the babies to be dedicated and as they were doing that something was connecting to that side these are this this is the side where people are what am I to do here then as a marriage to go the deacons came and said excuse me pastor this way but God is saying this way let me go the way of God first and I will come back this way I say move closer to that baby the Deep was called into the day and the moment it took a glance the Revelation became clear yeah say I've seen the Lost Christ now I can depart in peace what have what God has had my life for has now come to pass I can go now what happened God gave God opened his eyes despite all the criticism to see the expectation come to pass right the promise of God we also preserve your life you must have the revelation of the one who promised as long as you hold that very tight amen it will it will make your faith consistent yes let me close it by this no matter how weak your expectation is hold it very tight because let me say this what God on us is not the quality of your expectation underline it is the quality of your faith yeah because you cannot expect as I said a while ago without having faith and faith is strengthened by the revelation of who made the promise I will buy you a Thai pastor you believe it because you believe I can afford the time so anytime you see me you remember the promise and you look forward to its fulfillment yeah when you even feel I'm delaying you can use some style to remind me yeah my brother do you remember and I would say I remember right the tie is on his way I've actually ordered it I wanted to be a sick one that's why you believe it because you know my ability yes yes and I'm saying tonight when you know the one who had spoken it becomes easy for you to accept the promise and when you accept the promise you'll be expecting the Fulfillment so first as a connection with expectation it is that faith that God honors not necessarily the quality of your expectation if I say time the person might just be expecting just any time do you understand but me that promise so now only a sick one is good for the pastor then when I bring it I wasn't expecting something this much oh to me this is what you deserve right that is the way God does these things so the quality of the expectation will not short Change the result God will still give it to you as he wanted it yes let me prove that to you as I went down lemon traveled all the way to Syria from Syria to Israel because she believed he believed in the testimony of a small girl the Bible call her a damn self damn self relatively is a young girl by interpretation now this is for you my young friends this damn cell was an Israelite but she found herself in Syria not by a choice she was a captive of War but no matter how emergent or how desperate or how quick how sudden I capture was one thing she never felt to go with was the god of Israel if that God was still like this for Auto Park she might have missed it but that God was already in her life the reason we are coming for these services is not for us to have a distant relationship with a book called Bible is for that Bible to come into us and we become the Bible and the Bible become us that is the Fulfillment of our joy listen to me George we are coming to learn the presence of the son to have all the greenness of our life baked until we become bread of life on the Lord's table for us to eat amen these Messengers must become their message let us know waste our season let's not be slothful let's not be sluggish let us eat and accumulate we must become our food you are what you are eating that is what they said if you eat balanced diet your growth will reflect balanced diet because after you eat it goes into your belief for digestion after digestion comes absorption once it's absorbed it influences your stature isn't it yes is that not correct Mama uh-huh so you are what you are eating if you are eating the word of the Lord you become the word of the Lord are you catching it you must become my brother you must become my sister because that is the only way to survive the pressure and the school is it is not a book in your hands that will give you Survivor it is not even Fellowship like this because fellowshiping like this will become for memories amen yes maybe through here maybe one day maybe just all alone like this young lady was all alone but that which you have become will give you Survivor a time of emergency is going to come upon the head and you might not even be able to pack all the books whether on your phone on your tablet or even in the physical form but the much that has been you will give you Survivor at that time so while we have the opportunity let's be eaten and be gluttonous George I say be what gluttonous about don't be gluttonous about burger right because it could give you side effects but there's a food that has no side effects that's the message of the hour spiritual food induces it every content is digestible and absorbable praise the Lord this is why the prophet said taking everything because we are going to need every bit of it in the days that lay ahead so this girl parked without the god of Israel and a life was different that was why when she got up to give a testimony she never preached all she said was that all this problem General has if he could only go to Israel does the prophet of God in there all the problem will be over and she said it with the sense of responsibility not mind the weather it could happen or not at the risk of our integrity and our life give a testimony amen and guess what all the entire Syria went to work by our testimony she was a powerful generational influencer those are the kind of people you should emulate all those social media Hellbound influencers that will teach you bad songs Bad Manners bad vulgar dressing and all kinds of things they are not watch it for you you are not a low life don't live inferior to them right are you with me so go put your phones of dirty nonsense I call them nonsense Dirty music Let Me Tell You music can cast out demons and music can bring in demons if you could cast it out for David for Saul he could bring it in I've seen people listen to music I was in South America Guyana one time when a young fellow shot another guy and what was he listening to it was listed I've forgotten the day did they call it Puff Daddy or something one name like that he said if anybody makes a pass at your girlfriend shot in Get Him shot that was the song and this guy listened to this song he said it was a national concern in Guyana that particular year maybe 2016. he said I listen to that music and that's what this guy was doing and I got him shot is that it so something this the music anointed him parting with the demons to actualize so look whatever you are lending your ears to has the capacity to influence you I wish I could preach on influence brother Brown said things people do we are inspired by enticing spirits and he said nobody lives the life of isolation you are either been influenced from above or from Beneath Your influences goes beyond physical they are spiritual levels to our influence this is why we must keep ourselves from those dirty nonsense are you with me Brethren I hope it's not too tight God bless you and if it is God bless you too it's for deliverance you love him so this is small girl give a testimony and the reason they took us serious was because they knew there was a life there was something different about and she was not just like any other Syrian oh be like that my brother let your moderation be known to all men wherever you are let your banner be clear so the all of Syria came to Israel by the testimony of a small girl not even the sermon of a Preacher they sent him to the king the king in Israel had no Revelation like the girl because the girl sent to the prophet but you know government thing they have to go to the king so that they don't look like a spy but eventually it got to the prophet but this is where I'm going when neyman was coming to the prophet Nema was like a Pentecostal guy who had his own expectation of how his healing should take place according to the scripture right maybe it would be like he was expecting some gymnastics right and some ruling in the spirit and some turning you know we have preachers today we'll be using finger to control people do like this the man will run like this run like this when it does like this the man will fall far he said that's powerful anointing and everybody will be jumping he was expecting something like that what a prophet never even came out he said go watch at the pool of uh is it Jordan yeah and you'll be fine and the man said I thought you would come out and do something that was the quality of his expectation but God was determined to honor his faith yes right because he couldn't have found himself in Israel is that right if he did not believe the testimony of that girl so whichever way whichever way was expecting was not an issue to God right it was the FED behind it that he recognized that's right then the servant said look if the man of God told us to do something much more terrible in your estimation than this won't you do it or you don't want to be free from General neyman PSS FSS mni DDD bought a leper so you make sense sometimes let's go and they go to the water he was expecting after the first deep small small changes and the servant said seven times continue he did until since no change he said the man of God said seven right when it dipped the seven times which all is the complexes and everything God healed him anyhow so it is not the quality of your expectation it will shortchange you it is the quality of your faith last line the lame and they get beautiful yeah do you remember him yeah when he saw Peter James and John these three Partners again when he saw them coming he was expecting that he looked at them with the way they addressed this one should be able to offer ten dollars maybe this one five dollars but I think this one will do 2015 or 20. so collectively I should be able to be doing 30 and 40 dollars from this guy that was the quality of his expectation right just something for the nest meal Nest relief yeah but here was God ready to give a permanent solution did you catch that yeah and it was still not short change him he will still not reduce the blessing to the level of what he was expecting because it is not the quality of the expectation it is the quality of the faith did you catch that you cannot expect without having faith yes and when those guys came he must have been disappointed he said look at us even go we don't have so with your shirts suits tie everything looking sharp and neat you don't have even a dollar is that what you are saying you don't deserve to live in Minneapolis go to your village my friend right but he didn't do that it was just dumbfounded and they told him you might want the dollar or something but what we have you won the temporary relief but we've got a permanent solution so it wasn't short thing still right because he could believe yeah in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk however weak or strong your expectation it hold it very tight yeah it will help you it will motivate you it will keep you consistent it will keep your testimony intact and may the Lord bless you Shalom to the bride of Christ [Applause] God bless you sir amen you can just sit down and just enjoy them you know just just you just flow in the all of the anointing praise the Lord that was
