[32:28] praying and
[32:30] and uh
[32:31] committing some things to the lord
[32:34] and i taught about uh
[32:36] i thought about hannah
[32:40] this uh
[32:41] there's a song that uh
[32:43] uh is just few chorus from from hana
[32:47] prayer to the lord in uh first samuel
[32:50] chapter two
[32:51] and uh a little chorus we used to sing
[32:54] back home uh
[32:56] he's the lifter up off my head
[32:59] you know when the enemy tried to pull me
[33:00] down in shame so i was thinking that and
[33:03] uh and then i i said i i wanted to look
[33:06] for it and i went looking in the
[33:08] scripture but then i came across another
[33:11] chorus
[33:13] that's first samuel chapter 2
[33:16] verse 2
[33:18] and uh
[33:25] which of course first samuel chapter 2
[33:27] verse 2 reads there is none holy as the
[33:30] lord
[33:32] for there is none beside thee
[33:35] neither
[33:36] is there any like our rock
[33:39] and then i put the last verse there
[33:41] because it repeats again that's how the
[33:44] chorus repeats
[33:47] uh i don't know let me try my voices and
[33:50] see if i can and sing it now
[33:53] there is no there is no
[33:56] holy eyes the
[33:59] lord
[34:01] for there is no
[34:05] decided
[34:10] neither is there's any rock like our god
[34:17] there is no
[34:20] holy as the law
[34:25] there is none holy as
[34:29] the
[34:30] law
[34:32] for there is no
[34:36] be
[34:37] such thing
[34:41] neither is
[34:42] there's any rock
[34:45] like our
[34:47] [Music]
[34:55] there is no
[35:02] [Music]
[35:10] is

[36:44] let's give the lord a hand of praise
[36:50] hallelujah
[36:52] once again reaches heart in the name of
[36:54] the lord jesus
[36:55] amen praise the lord uh
[36:58] thank you musicians that will be that'll
[37:00] be all for now and uh if we think
[37:02] another song we will call you up so we
[37:04] think
[37:05] amen praise the lord
[37:07] hallelujah
[37:09] amen
[37:14] you know every every uh
[37:16] preacher in a sense has a way of getting
[37:19] rid of their nervousness my own is to
[37:22] sink when i start singing it helps me to
[37:25] get rid of my nervousness praise the
[37:27] lord the lord bless you you can have
[37:28] your seat for a while
[37:30] amen
[37:32] praise the lord
[37:33] hallelujah
[37:35] amen
[37:38] all the faces are familiar
[37:41] praise the lord so uh
[37:44] there is one guest that we
[37:46] never get tired we're coming is the lord
[37:48] jesus christ amen praise the lord
[37:51] he's always welcome he's most welcome
[37:54] and again now we'll i will welcome
[37:59] a brother
[38:00] joseph moshota then his wife
[38:03] and and the reason why i'm doing that is
[38:05] because
[38:07] brother moshert has sent me a message
[38:09] that the next time i see him in church
[38:11] he's a visitor
[38:13] and so i want to make them to feel
[38:16] welcome
[38:17] and
[38:19] i don't take those things lightly i take
[38:21] it very serious because i believe we
[38:23] don't come here to play games
[38:26] this is the house of the living god and
[38:29] i'm not yet to play games
[38:31] i told you people before i'm not running
[38:33] a liberian church
[38:36] i'm not running an african church
[38:39] i'm running a bible-believing church
[38:43] by the message of the hour
[38:45] [Applause]
[38:48] this is not a family thing
[38:52] praise the lord
[38:53] so i will tell you brother joseph i
[38:55] respect your opinion and i accept it
[38:58] and
[39:00] for the fact that
[39:01] [Music]
[39:02] i gave you uh you know an opportunity to
[39:05] this puppet as a preacher
[39:08] i would take that back
[39:09] and you as a visitor i will treat you as
[39:12] a visitor in a way that we treat all of
[39:14] our visitors
[39:16] and
[39:19] and then
[39:21] because
[39:23] i believe that
[39:25] a man must thoroughly pray
[39:28] that's why brother branham said choosing
[39:31] a bride you know you must pray to be
[39:33] able to choose your church and be able
[39:35] to choose whoever
[39:37] is your pastor
[39:39] uh
[39:40] brother joel traveled from south africa
[39:43] you know uh uh
[39:46] marry my sister-in-law
[39:48] and came i mean you had you had a right
[39:50] to choose anywhere in the u.s to go i
[39:53] didn't
[39:54] you know call you uh you know as a
[39:57] ministry you came and then uh i mean
[39:59] this is the local church
[40:01] we've been here for some ride and and uh
[40:04] even when we moved here with this church
[40:06] i took four years
[40:08] to even accept to be a pastor of this
[40:11] church
[40:13] and
[40:14] and i'm not going to get on any kind of
[40:17] for intimidation from anybody
[40:20] i don't know where you met the lord i
[40:22] don't know how the law called you like
[40:24] i've told you i inherit this church
[40:26] and i respect the people that i met here
[40:30] and some of you that travel here i
[40:33] inherit you also
[40:35] you know the thing about
[40:36] inheritance you got to be careful
[40:40] because sometimes people don't value
[40:42] inheritance
[40:45] solomon said it inefficient
[40:47] i mean in ecclesiastic
[40:50] he sees a man labor and he labored and
[40:52] all that he labored for he leave it unto
[40:54] others and they wasted it because they
[40:57] didn't label for it
[41:00] praise the lord
[41:02] so i respect your
[41:04] your choice of uh
[41:10] whatever you want to do i think
[41:12] he told me he's putting an altar in his
[41:14] house so we might have a church in uh
[41:16] rosemount
[41:19] shout out assembly
[41:20] and we'll be glad to to support or work
[41:24] with you if you wanna stall
[41:26] and uh
[41:30] praise the lord
[41:37] i mean there's i mean they're just a
[41:38] little few things i could say to had
[41:41] almost four hour meetings with the
[41:43] deacons yesterday
[41:45] uh delivery uh talking about these
[41:47] things and some other things that we
[41:49] have to talk about
[41:54] i believe that
[41:56] even as a church we have come to the
[41:58] junction
[42:00] we have come to a junction
[42:02] and as i've taught you before and and
[42:06] teach from the word brother branham said
[42:08] in junction of time
[42:10] and just imagine the angel of the lord
[42:12] woke brother branham up and gave him a
[42:13] message for the church that's what he
[42:15] said he says at night the angel gave me
[42:17] this message for the church
[42:19] he says at the junction at every
[42:21] junction he said there are two things
[42:23] that happen he says the enemy coming as
[42:25] a flood
[42:27] but the spirit of god also raised up a
[42:30] standard
[42:32] now
[42:33] what we have to watch
[42:35] as individuals in our lives and and also
[42:39] in whatever we do
[42:41] is that
[42:43] sometimes we get overtaken when the
[42:45] enemy come as a flood
[42:48] and then
[42:49] we don't we don't because of our human
[42:52] nature we don't get to identify
[42:55] that the spirit of god is there to raise
[42:57] up a standard
[43:00] so we get carried about with all the you
[43:02] know uh
[43:03] things that are happening around our
[43:05] life whether it is sickness whether it
[43:07] is financial problem whether it is
[43:09] whatever problem it is even what is the
[43:11] church problem
[43:13] but this is what the prophet of god said
[43:16] and i will tell you that i had a
[43:18] blessing preaching this in zimbabwe
[43:20] because those people know how to pull
[43:22] out of you
[43:23] and uh
[43:24] this is what the prophet of god said
[43:28] uh when when that is happening
[43:32] there he says when the people
[43:37] identified
[43:39] the spirit of god that is there to raise
[43:41] up his tender he says they move into the
[43:44] miracles
[43:46] because the only potence is there to do
[43:48] the miracles
[43:50] he said but if the people don't identify
[43:52] it that goes into judgment
[43:58] praise the lord
[43:59] now brother branham in that message
[44:02] identified
[44:03] seven
[44:05] dispensational junction
[44:08] the seven junctions that he identified
[44:10] in that message they are dispensational
[44:14] but they are not the only junction we
[44:16] have
[44:16] even in your own life you have junction
[44:19] every seven years you come to a junction
[44:24] and there are things that happen around
[44:26] you
[44:30] in your health you come to a junction
[44:32] even in a church we come to a junction
[44:38] do you know that there are some times
[44:39] where the church
[44:41] is is just under
[44:45] god just pulled the anointing
[44:48] of the ox on the church
[44:50] sure
[44:51] and at that time the church goes from
[44:53] one problem to another problem do you
[44:55] know that yes sir that's right that's
[44:58] right
[44:59] sometimes the church is under the eagles
[45:01] anointing revelation and things are
[45:03] happening well that's what we like
[45:06] but god also work with four different
[45:08] anointing
[45:10] [Music]
[45:27] praise the lord
[45:30] so just like i said brother joseph i
[45:32] respect your
[45:33] your choice
[45:35] and i will tell you that uh
[45:37] uh i sir as a brother
[45:41] you know uh brother-in-law with that one
[45:43] we will solve it out of the church
[45:46] right now his brother in christ
[45:49] amen brother-in-law relationship is out
[45:51] of the church right now his brother in
[45:54] christ
[45:55] and as far as i know until few minutes
[45:58] i'll stay the pastor of this church
[46:00] i don't know if he has changed
[46:04] and
[46:07] with some of the things that i pick up
[46:09] from the deacons
[46:11] of you standing right in the hallway
[46:13] there and making comment that i'm trying
[46:15] to trash your ministry and trashing
[46:17] other people ministry setting them down
[46:20] i don't even have confidence to allow
[46:22] you to pray behind my puppet
[46:25] i'm telling you that right now to your
[46:26] face
[46:31] i don't have confidence to have you come
[46:33] behind this puppet and pray
[46:38] because as far as i'm concerned there is
[46:41] nobody in this church i'm trashing down
[46:44] church is not wrong like playing cards
[46:47] we don't play shuffle cards and choose
[46:50] who to preach
[46:55] it's not a spinning table
[46:58] jordan you preach today that brother dan
[47:00] you preach tomorrow then uh brother jose
[47:03] you preach it does not run like that
[47:07] that's not how church operates
[47:13] and i'll say to many of you young
[47:14] brothers
[47:16] you better go to school learn and get a
[47:18] career
[47:20] the moment you start picking a bible to
[47:22] read the first thing you're start
[47:23] looking at the pulpit
[47:25] so when they say come and give testimony
[47:27] you now can take
[47:28] one whole chapter to read
[47:34] i was reading this scripture it was on
[47:36] my heart
[47:41] you better go to school and look for the
[47:43] holy ghost
[47:51] so now you start reading bible then then
[47:53] now you have you have something on your
[47:55] heart you want to say it to the church
[48:07] and i won't take all the church time on
[48:09] those things because there are other
[48:11] things that i have to deal with this
[48:12] morning
[48:14] but uh
[48:15] i just want to say that to
[48:18] our brother
[48:20] because
[48:24] i thought that
[48:26] it was necessary for the church to let
[48:28] me to know
[48:29] and now being a member of the church
[48:32] you have a choice of where to send your
[48:34] tithe
[48:35] if you don't trust my ministry i don't
[48:37] feed on your ties
[48:40] i don't feed you on your ties so find a
[48:43] place if you send it to this church we
[48:45] have missions we have offerings and the
[48:48] trustees will choose to do it deal with
[48:50] that but i've told the trustees in this
[48:53] church
[48:54] if a man do not respect what we are
[48:56] doing here
[48:57] i i don't want i don't i don't feel on
[49:00] the amenities on the money
[49:03] because i'm not here for money
[49:15] praise the lord
[49:20] a couple of weeks ago also
[49:22] uh
[49:25] when the
[49:26] the
[49:27] we got to the lockdown and different
[49:29] things that were happening
[49:31] i told
[49:34] just before we could come back to church
[49:36] we gathered the brothers here
[49:39] and to discuss on how we were coming
[49:41] back and upon their decision were made
[49:43] we're going to wear max we're going to
[49:45] get sanitizer and everything that we
[49:47] decided to do
[49:49] and
[49:55] then few of the brothers were choosing
[49:58] to help the deacons
[50:00] brother stephen wolves brother
[50:03] johnny
[50:04] and and also brother joseph was asked to
[50:08] which of course i was there if he feared
[50:10] that it was not his calling to do it
[50:12] maybe his calling was we need to preach
[50:14] but that was fine
[50:16] and
[50:19] but
[50:20] these brothers were asked
[50:22] to help the deacons in ushering
[50:25] you know making sure people use the
[50:27] sanitizer you know helping the cars in
[50:30] the parking lot you know just just
[50:33] because we have a very small space and
[50:35] we just wanted to manage and make sure
[50:37] that we keep in regard of what uh
[50:42] the state was requiring us to do as a
[50:44] church so we brought all these brothers
[50:46] on board
[50:48] and then when we when we came back
[50:50] uh uh you know
[50:52] the brothers were were serving us
[50:55] i remember a couple of times uh our
[50:57] brother uh uh
[51:00] brother scat bless his heart he will
[51:03] always uh love to encourage couple of
[51:05] times you call brother johnny oppa you
[51:07] know
[51:09] even having to leave songs in order
[51:11] there
[51:12] and uh
[51:14] [Music]
[51:17] you know
[51:18] and
[51:20] as
[51:20] as as as a pastor i knew
[51:24] you know uh uh
[51:26] at that time that those some of those
[51:28] things were very good for our brother
[51:30] because i knew what he was going through
[51:32] personally and we
[51:34] you know there was there were time we we
[51:37] we met here a couple of times in the
[51:39] week and uh you know uh
[51:42] and different things that we had to deal
[51:45] with so
[51:46] uh
[51:47] and yeah and then he saved the church
[51:49] throughout that time until we are where
[51:52] we are now
[51:53] so in that light he and brother stephen
[51:55] woods have always uh
[51:57] uh
[51:58] hang around and help the deacons out
[52:00] there you know putting people
[52:03] in seats and doing different things what
[52:05] we want them to do
[52:07] and
[52:10] but a couple of weeks ago
[52:12] brother johnny traveled
[52:14] and
[52:15] which of course he told me he was
[52:16] traveling and there were there were some
[52:18] other things today and i'm not yet to go
[52:21] into the details but i i'm just only
[52:24] want to bring this to you because
[52:27] as we are living
[52:30] in the in the world there where uh
[52:32] information
[52:34] is just all around us
[52:37] i believe that
[52:39] we have uh
[52:40] the god-given responsibility to be able
[52:43] to protect
[52:45] the image of this local assembly
[52:48] in a sense of
[52:50] what
[52:51] what we believe what we stands for
[52:54] praise the lord
[52:56] i believe that the church
[52:58] is just like jesus said about the good
[53:00] samaritans
[53:02] and uh uh
[53:06] is is uh is a place that is just like an
[53:09] in or a hospital
[53:11] where
[53:13] the law by the spirit you know will lead
[53:16] people to come in and we all you know
[53:18] there is there is one thing that is
[53:20] common in the hospital is that i don't
[53:22] know what it is but what's designed but
[53:25] you know those hospital dresses for some
[53:28] reason they're always tied to the back
[53:31] okay
[53:32] everywhere is covered in the back so we
[53:34] all have a spot on our back that is open
[53:39] and
[53:41] so i believe that's the way the church
[53:42] age you know our doors it's a revolving
[53:45] doors we have our people that have come
[53:47] in and have gone and we always try the
[53:50] best that we can to accommodate people
[53:52] that we were coming in but yet instead
[53:55] we we must not step down the standard of
[53:58] the word just because we want members
[54:01] no for no reason for nobody
[54:05] are we going to step down the standard
[54:07] of the word
[54:08] no no people come
[54:10] we talk to them and we we you know get
[54:13] to know them and we let them know you
[54:15] know brother
[54:16] if this is the situation you know i will
[54:19] i will let you know that five brothers
[54:22] people that have traveled through this
[54:23] church before you know some of them
[54:25] travel to the states and and uh maybe
[54:28] it's on a dv program diversity visa and
[54:32] and uh maybe they had to to to get into
[54:35] some kind of a marriage situation for
[54:37] them to travel when i know about that i
[54:40] make you know directly what the word of
[54:42] god says
[54:45] i said well maybe you did not know
[54:49] but you traveled for this reason but uh
[54:53] i mean because those are things that
[54:56] take that that people take lightly
[55:01] they take it lightly
[55:04] and i hope i can share some things to
[55:06] you there's with you this morning
[55:09] uh which of course is not really what i
[55:11] want to preach on but uh
[55:13] i'm obligated to share it to you because
[55:15] it's the word of god
[55:16] and uh
[55:18] so i tell them i let them know this is
[55:20] the situation
[55:22] i will tell you if you as long as you
[55:24] stay in this local assembly i can never
[55:27] move you to an office
[55:30] the reason because of this
[55:34] if you had to travel for this reason i
[55:36] mean you join yourself to someone as
[55:38] well as a husband to travel you put
[55:41] yourself under on a law
[55:46] of polygamy
[55:50] you have put yourself under the lord of
[55:52] polygamy
[55:54] and i always set them down we talk about
[55:56] it nicely they will ask questions i will
[55:58] i will show them places in the scripture
[56:01] you know uh uh
[56:03] you know look at this look at this and
[56:05] look at this thing and i've by the grace
[56:07] of god we have had you know uh a success
[56:10] in talking to many of these brothers
[56:12] that never knew
[56:13] that uh you know that the word of god
[56:16] takes the coveting of marriage very
[56:18] serious
[56:25] for the matter of fact i think you heard
[56:26] the the
[56:28] the tag team playing a man running away
[56:31] from the presence of the lord
[56:32] uh you remember i promised you young
[56:34] people i was going to talk on on some
[56:37] things concerning and uh marriage and
[56:39] other days so
[56:41] i told
[56:43] brother jordan if their team can play us
[56:45] the entire series towards marriage and
[56:47] divorce
[56:49] and and if you have time you go back and
[56:52] you can read it personally you can study
[56:54] it but we're going to go through that
[56:56] series as the holy spirit will lead us
[57:00] and
[57:01] brother brandon preached a couple of
[57:03] messages before he preached marriage and
[57:05] divorce this morning i was just
[57:07] listening to the seed it's not held by
[57:09] the shock he said in that message i'm
[57:11] laying the foundation for what i will
[57:13] say on sunday
[57:15] so he first started preaching a man
[57:17] running away from the presence of the
[57:19] lord you studied that message brother
[57:20] branham make it it's a quote he says
[57:23] marriage is responsibility
[57:28] so he brought that message to show the
[57:31] kind of a responsibility that was lying
[57:33] on his shoulder
[57:35] as a prophet of god
[57:37] to be able to deal with the marriage
[57:40] question of this age
[57:44] he had that responsibility
[57:46] that's why he went to finger mountain
[57:49] to get an instruction from the lord what
[57:51] to say
[57:55] it's not a game marriage is not a game
[57:58] it's a responsibility
[58:04] after then he preached a message the
[58:06] seat is not held with the shock
[58:08] on in that message brother brandon picks
[58:10] up the three
[58:13] women
[58:14] that
[58:15] the seed of abraham passed through
[58:18] but yet what he taught in that message
[58:21] that is attached to the marriage
[58:23] covenant is
[58:25] uh
[58:26] he taught
[58:27] that
[58:32] actually this is for women when he gets
[58:34] to marriage in davos then he brought he
[58:36] brought eve into the picture but under
[58:38] the seat is not held with the shark
[58:40] because he was talking about the moving
[58:43] of the seed of abraham
[58:45] showing to us that the promised seed
[58:48] that god promised abraham was not isaac
[58:51] it was the lord jesus christ which is
[58:53] the royal seed and honor that seed we
[58:56] have the blessing of abraham
[59:00] so he showed
[59:03] uh sarah as the free woman but he said
[59:05] she doubted the word of god and he
[59:08] showed uh uh hager as the bound woman
[59:11] that was also brought in the promise now
[59:14] this is this is what where brother
[59:16] brennan brings
[59:17] brings a hager into death because he's
[59:21] going to show us that
[59:25] there was a second covenant after the
[59:27] fall
[59:29] and that second covenant introduced
[59:31] polygamy
[59:34] which he said was legal at that time
[59:38] so that's where hagar comes in to this
[59:45] praise the lord
[59:47] then he talks about mary which was the
[59:49] virgin bride of the virgin
[59:52] uh uh
[59:54] you know womb that the seed came true
[59:58] and then the prophet of god uh will
[1:00:01] preach
[1:00:02] um
[1:00:05] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:00:09] which of course i believe
[1:00:11] knowing the responsibility that he had
[1:00:14] he was going to tie his ministry
[1:00:17] to the same as moses
[1:00:23] god's choosing place of worship was the
[1:00:25] next message he preached and then he did
[1:00:27] a wedding in the afternoon that was on
[1:00:29] saturday sunday he preached marriage and
[1:00:32] davos in the evening he preached who is
[1:00:35] this matrices day
[1:00:37] so
[1:00:39] i just told
[1:00:41] i had on my mind that we were going to
[1:00:43] to
[1:00:44] to go through that message especially
[1:00:47] as i would be picking here and there to
[1:00:49] talk to
[1:00:50] to
[1:00:51] the young people and encourage them and
[1:00:54] see most of our
[1:00:59] young people young adults
[1:01:01] preparing their mind for marriage and
[1:01:04] [Music]
[1:01:05] and all of that so
[1:01:07] so we're going to go through that and
[1:01:11] by the grace of god
[1:01:13] you you come
[1:01:15] elliot on sunday you will hear the tape
[1:01:17] play you can read it back home and then
[1:01:19] follow up in church and
[1:01:21] whichever way that the lord will be able
[1:01:23] to lead you to do it
[1:01:25] but getting back to
[1:01:27] our our need here
[1:01:29] so uh
[1:01:31] we uh
[1:01:33] uh
[1:01:34] talked to brother uh johnny before he
[1:01:37] traveled and then uh
[1:01:40] based on our conversation
[1:01:43] uh
[1:01:44] when he traveled and i
[1:01:46] i came to find out later
[1:01:48] you know
[1:01:49] from some of the pictures that he posts
[1:01:51] that he have already done a wedding
[1:01:53] which of course you know he and myself
[1:01:55] we did sort of talk about that he
[1:01:57] thought he told me he was going to do a
[1:01:59] wedding and no that was not a
[1:02:01] conversation that we had
[1:02:03] so
[1:02:03] [Music]
[1:02:05] i thought that i needed faith to to uh
[1:02:07] you know uh talk to our brother and make
[1:02:10] him to realize that you know that is uh
[1:02:14] a choice that you have made
[1:02:17] but based on what we
[1:02:19] as a local church believe in
[1:02:22] we will
[1:02:23] remove you from the office
[1:02:25] of
[1:02:26] of of
[1:02:28] usher even though is not
[1:02:31] a voted office even though it's not
[1:02:35] a
[1:02:37] biblical office but
[1:02:39] you have the responsibility of people
[1:02:43] so
[1:02:46] we won't have you doing that
[1:02:49] again
[1:02:50] and
[1:02:52] and you know
[1:02:55] which of course also i know
[1:02:58] some of you might have seen
[1:02:59] the pictures
[1:03:01] on on facebook and all of that and you
[1:03:05] know how things goes you know when those
[1:03:07] things happen the people don't hear
[1:03:09] nothing in church and it just looks like
[1:03:11] oh i think the pastor is okay with that
[1:03:14] so based on that that's the reason why i
[1:03:16] choose that i will take this time and
[1:03:18] address the church
[1:03:20] and make the church to know
[1:03:22] you know i i i like just like i told
[1:03:25] brother johnny right on my way back i
[1:03:27] took i took a time after getting some
[1:03:29] nap on the flight took my time and
[1:03:31] looked through every quote that brother
[1:03:32] bram talks on on polygamy i'm not going
[1:03:34] to preach on polygamy this morning don't
[1:03:36] worry about it
[1:03:37] and uh
[1:03:39] but
[1:03:40] what happened is that
[1:03:43] uh
[1:03:44] there is a statement i was looking for
[1:03:46] and i think i heard brother branham
[1:03:48] saying it uh somewhere here
[1:03:50] um
[1:03:53] uh there's a statement i was looking for
[1:03:55] i wish i would share it with you
[1:04:02] i think that's very insane in a year
[1:04:04] he talks about this
[1:04:25] oh
[1:04:26] praise the lord okay yeah he talks about
[1:04:29] this in the seventh week of daniel he
[1:04:31] says in the nations where
[1:04:33] they have polygamy it's a thousand times
[1:04:36] better
[1:04:37] and yet
[1:04:38] polygamy is wrong
[1:04:41] we know
[1:04:43] but just show how degrading now he's
[1:04:47] he's comparing that
[1:04:49] with
[1:04:50] the the loose immoral life
[1:04:55] okay that even though those people
[1:04:58] practice it there but those women are
[1:05:01] they are committed
[1:05:06] completely different from a woman that
[1:05:08] is just loose i mean with with every man
[1:05:10] that comes away it's completely
[1:05:12] different that is what he's referring to
[1:05:17] now but what caught my mind was you know
[1:05:20] he says polygamy is wrong
[1:05:22] now over the years
[1:05:24] i've had this view
[1:05:26] where the uh you know you talk to
[1:05:28] brothers and and it looks like
[1:05:31] we we try to dismiss the thought of
[1:05:34] polygamy
[1:05:36] without rightly
[1:05:37] showing how it's wrong
[1:05:41] now
[1:05:42] a paul says a bishop should be a man of
[1:05:46] one wife
[1:05:47] the reason why he said that is because
[1:05:50] of polygamy
[1:05:56] the reason why they come to be a man of
[1:05:58] one wife is because of polygamy does not
[1:06:02] means that the man should have one wife
[1:06:04] at home but if he was ever married
[1:06:07] before he comes to the faith
[1:06:10] that's right
[1:06:13] if he was married and maybe he he put
[1:06:15] away his wife not nor ignoring the word
[1:06:18] and god married again
[1:06:19] and he comes to the faith
[1:06:22] well it's his faith in jesus
[1:06:25] but when it comes to the order of the
[1:06:27] local church
[1:06:29] he cannot be a bishop he cannot be a
[1:06:31] deacon
[1:06:34] so what is forbidding him is the law of
[1:06:36] polygamy so do we believe in polygamy
[1:06:44] you see it's a very tricky
[1:06:46] tricky
[1:06:48] subject
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:52] if we will hold to this
[1:06:55] to this if we will hold a brother
[1:06:58] accountable that uh uh he should be a
[1:07:01] man of one wife if we will hold him but
[1:07:04] then which of course is based on the
[1:07:07] lord of polygamy
[1:07:12] praise the lord
[1:07:17] then we believe in polygamy
[1:07:23] now i think most of the time the sense
[1:07:25] there is that when the question is asked
[1:07:27] do we believe in polygamy what goes in
[1:07:30] people's mind is that do we practice it
[1:07:36] do we agree that it's wrong
[1:07:39] for the fact that based on the lord of
[1:07:41] god a man will not be able to assume an
[1:07:44] office in the local church
[1:07:47] yeah we hold to that principle
[1:07:55] are you getting where i'm coming from
[1:07:56] with this
[1:08:02] we don't believe it to practice it to
[1:08:04] live it out
[1:08:07] but we believe it to guide ourselves
[1:08:10] because it's the law of god
[1:08:19] are we together
[1:08:22] and uh so
[1:08:25] i i
[1:08:26] uh you know i've i taught that i was
[1:08:29] going to bring this
[1:08:30] to the church and uh just speak on some
[1:08:33] few things here
[1:08:35] and uh
[1:08:38] people
[1:08:39] goes through
[1:08:41] you know uh uh
[1:08:43] situations in their lives
[1:08:45] you know some before they came to the
[1:08:47] faith some even while they are in the
[1:08:50] faith you know different things people
[1:08:52] goes through
[1:08:56] but just like i said
[1:08:57] you know uh
[1:09:00] if if there is one that ever comes
[1:09:02] through this assembly unless i don't
[1:09:04] know
[1:09:05] you know i mean unless i don't know
[1:09:08] because i don't believe
[1:09:10] of having any interest
[1:09:12] to protect
[1:09:13] you know uh uh
[1:09:16] i mean the man cannot be protect
[1:09:18] protected by any fake leaf amen if i
[1:09:21] would give you any
[1:09:22] special privilege to protect you it's
[1:09:24] just a fake leave don't take it
[1:09:27] what you need is a sheepskin the word
[1:09:32] that's what you need
[1:09:41] so let me just read some few things here
[1:09:43] and then i will try and get to what i
[1:09:45] want to preach this morning praise the
[1:09:48] lord
[1:09:51] dania
[1:09:52] i spoke to your mama this morning
[1:09:55] she would love to witness you being
[1:09:57] baptized
[1:09:59] so
[1:10:00] she asked if we can do it another time i
[1:10:03] think she was uh called emergency to
[1:10:05] work this morning
[1:10:07] so uh
[1:10:08] we will
[1:10:09] we will plan to do it either in the week
[1:10:12] or on the next weekend okay
[1:10:15] praise the lord i know it will it will
[1:10:17] it will do her good
[1:10:19] okay it will do her good your mama has
[1:10:22] gone through a lot for you so
[1:10:24] uh for her to stand there and witness
[1:10:27] you being baptized is going to help her
[1:10:35] now brother branham takes this where he
[1:10:37] approached this over in uh
[1:10:40] mauritian davos now we see them
[1:10:44] after the beginning we see then after
[1:10:47] the beginning
[1:10:49] it was something else
[1:10:51] was introduced now what he's talking
[1:10:54] about
[1:10:55] you you will listen to the tape you can
[1:10:56] go back and read but he's talking about
[1:10:59] after god made one man and one woman
[1:11:03] the bible says the lord blessed him
[1:11:06] and uh
[1:11:08] but then he's he's saying here
[1:11:11] after the beginning
[1:11:14] there was something that was introduced
[1:11:19] now this is
[1:11:20] this is going to shock you
[1:11:24] are you tired i don't expect you to say
[1:11:26] you are tired
[1:11:30] just say still a little longer he says
[1:11:32] uh
[1:11:33] then when the double coveted was made by
[1:11:37] the man and the woman through sex
[1:11:39] another coveting
[1:11:41] altogether
[1:11:43] not the original covenant
[1:11:46] but another covenant which of course we
[1:11:49] call it a permissive
[1:11:57] now
[1:11:58] what's introduced polygamy
[1:12:01] in all
[1:12:03] then
[1:12:04] after the beginning polygamy was
[1:12:06] introduced both in man
[1:12:10] and in peace
[1:12:12] after the beginning
[1:12:15] after
[1:12:16] the fall
[1:12:18] praise the lord
[1:12:20] so polygamy came after the fall
[1:12:26] praise the lord
[1:12:27] and uh uh
[1:12:29] so
[1:12:30] brother branham on a year is trying to
[1:12:33] make us to see the other
[1:12:37] this was
[1:12:38] this was a permissive coveting you know
[1:12:41] this was a permissive covenant that was
[1:12:43] given
[1:12:45] and
[1:12:49] uh i mean there are some things i can go
[1:12:51] into here
[1:12:52] and uh
[1:12:54] to be able to break this down but it's
[1:12:56] going to take our time
[1:12:58] and uh
[1:13:01] and again
[1:13:04] it's just it's just important for me to
[1:13:06] deal with you know what is what is
[1:13:08] necessary
[1:13:10] now you notice in in first corinthians
[1:13:13] 17 notice paul commanded the woman there
[1:13:15] is that
[1:13:17] the divorce of husband to remain single
[1:13:19] or to be reconciled that
[1:13:22] not to remarry she must remain single
[1:13:25] or to be reconciled back to her husband
[1:13:27] she cannot remarry she must remain
[1:13:30] single but notice he never said
[1:13:34] about the man
[1:13:36] see
[1:13:37] you can't make the word lie
[1:13:41] from the beginning
[1:13:43] the sex lord by polygamy
[1:13:47] now what does that mean
[1:13:53] what does that mean
[1:13:55] now the word of god runs true with
[1:13:58] nature
[1:13:59] with the nature of god
[1:14:01] run
[1:14:02] in to come trinity
[1:14:05] now so you will see he says but you see
[1:14:08] uh uh
[1:14:10] you are a juror if
[1:14:12] if you want to be talking to the woman
[1:14:15] and
[1:14:17] but
[1:14:18] the desire has to be in you
[1:14:26] now so what uh what what he's dealing
[1:14:29] here with is the other he brings out uh
[1:14:33] corinthian first corinthians 7
[1:14:36] which of course brother branham also
[1:14:38] used that in
[1:14:41] invisible union and talk talk about it
[1:14:43] being a prophecy of the church
[1:14:45] now so what is what is happening here is
[1:14:48] that he's holding the situation of the
[1:14:50] woman
[1:14:51] and i've always said says this and i
[1:14:54] tried to re-equate and you know uh and
[1:14:58] emphasize it to to the church
[1:15:01] because that is the word of god
[1:15:03] that is the reason
[1:15:07] the tree sacrifice was given to the
[1:15:09] woman
[1:15:12] as i've said before and according to
[1:15:14] what brother branham said in invisible
[1:15:17] union it was given to her because of
[1:15:20] redemption
[1:15:22] the power of the woman is in those
[1:15:24] virtues
[1:15:26] just like if the church keep them
[1:15:28] spiritually
[1:15:30] the power of the church in those virtues
[1:15:32] praying reading commitment to the word
[1:15:36] now so if you look here you will realize
[1:15:39] that
[1:15:41] on the the permissive lord
[1:15:44] under the permissive lord there was
[1:15:47] there that was introduced after the fall
[1:15:49] brother branham
[1:15:50] emphasize on that it was after the fall
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:57] after the man has lost that holy veil
[1:16:03] praise lord
[1:16:05] it was it was it was introduced
[1:16:08] and now both man and beast had to live
[1:16:11] live that way
[1:16:13] and uh but then he comes back yet and
[1:16:16] then he makes us to realize that
[1:16:20] because of the the the
[1:16:24] the sacredness the place of the woman
[1:16:28] because of the place of the woman
[1:16:34] she's the mother of all living
[1:16:37] amen
[1:16:39] because of that place of life
[1:16:44] because most of the time when people
[1:16:46] look into into this subject
[1:16:48] is it it seems to be it appears like
[1:16:52] it's an unjust law
[1:16:57] why should a man have you know uh
[1:17:00] have the right to to live polygamy and
[1:17:03] have many women that is under the old
[1:17:05] testament
[1:17:06] it's not what we are practicing right
[1:17:09] it's not right
[1:17:11] praise the lord
[1:17:12] because what you will establish and
[1:17:14] understand here is that
[1:17:17] polygamy
[1:17:18] came in
[1:17:20] in
[1:17:22] what should be adultery
[1:17:28] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:17:30] when he used uh first corinthians 7 he
[1:17:32] says if the woman
[1:17:35] then is adultery but it's the same law
[1:17:38] of polygamy
[1:17:44] praise lord
[1:17:48] now so uh
[1:17:50] just like i said i'm not preaching on
[1:17:51] the subject
[1:17:53] but i'm just trying to to uh
[1:17:58] make you all know uh i know uh
[1:18:01] uh
[1:18:02] brother johnny myself we had a talk on
[1:18:04] friday it was a good successful talk we
[1:18:07] look at things in the world i expressed
[1:18:09] my heart out to him and and you know and
[1:18:13] encouraging in his own personal faith
[1:18:16] and walk with god
[1:18:18] praise the lord
[1:18:20] amen so uh
[1:18:22] uh
[1:18:23] you know
[1:18:25] you that have your information
[1:18:27] and you you know you take your time to
[1:18:30] sit down at the house and just talk
[1:18:31] about people's situation
[1:18:33] uh uh you know all about this church you
[1:18:36] know what brother one is doing i know
[1:18:38] what brother one is doing and all of
[1:18:39] that
[1:18:40] uh i hope you are listening i hope your
[1:18:43] ears are open
[1:18:51] because instead of people to sit down
[1:18:53] and and prayed right
[1:18:55] they just sit back and and observe and
[1:18:58] says well i you know yeah if it is this
[1:19:00] person who are going to talk about it
[1:19:02] but this other person
[1:19:04] will not run in favor of testing
[1:19:10] praise the lord
[1:19:12] and if there's things that happen in
[1:19:14] this local church and i don't come on on
[1:19:15] the pulpit to talk about it it's because
[1:19:17] i deal with it
[1:19:20] if i don't believe that it's going to
[1:19:23] affect us as a church
[1:19:25] if i don't believe that
[1:19:28] your habit of putting things on facebook
[1:19:30] forced me to come on the pulpit
[1:19:33] because when you finish announcing it to
[1:19:35] the word
[1:19:37] then now you make me obligated
[1:19:43] praise the lord amen
[1:19:45] if you take you and your wi-fi to
[1:19:47] facebook i'm going to preach it on
[1:19:49] sunday
[1:20:05] praise the lord
[1:20:12] a lot of things that
[1:20:15] that becomes very very emotional to me
[1:20:18] and
[1:20:20] it is not because
[1:20:21] of weakness
[1:20:24] is because
[1:20:26] of the hours
[1:20:28] the time
[1:20:29] that i put behind those things
[1:20:33] that you don't have no idea about
[1:20:39] if you think we are just coming here for
[1:20:41] showmanship
[1:20:44] just to plot a bunch of quotes and read
[1:20:47] to you
[1:20:48] that's not how a church runs
[1:20:57] that's not how a church runs
[1:21:10] so if you have any other questions
[1:21:14] concerning the subject
[1:21:16] come and talk to me
[1:21:18] if you have any question
[1:21:24] concerning the position of our brother
[1:21:26] come and talk to me
[1:21:30] which of course
[1:21:31] like
[1:21:33] you know what was amazing
[1:21:37] i was telling the deacons right after
[1:21:39] the meeting
[1:21:45] some of the
[1:21:47] you know some of the people that in
[1:21:48] zimbabwe are following our service so i
[1:21:51] think i should just leave this one and
[1:21:52] preach my message okay
[1:21:56] i should just leave this one and preach
[1:21:58] my message
[1:21:59] i was visiting with the ministers and
[1:22:01] then uh you know we were talking some
[1:22:03] things in and they were talking
[1:22:05] something in the in their language they
[1:22:07] asked me to excuse them because it was
[1:22:09] church matters they were dealing with
[1:22:11] and while i was sitting there
[1:22:14] something just ministered to my heart
[1:22:16] and says i think this is what they are
[1:22:18] talking about
[1:22:19] and i'm telling you i nailed it right on
[1:22:21] the head i knew exactly that was what
[1:22:23] they were talking about
[1:22:24] because the pastor acts like we hear him
[1:22:27] talking like well let's talk to the
[1:22:28] brother and see what he was saying about
[1:22:31] it
[1:22:33] praise the lord
[1:22:35] and
[1:22:37] that's the faithfulness of god let's
[1:22:38] stand on our feet this morning

[1:25:57] but uh
[1:25:59] i believe that the spirit of the lord is
[1:26:00] here
[1:26:03] psalm chapter 22.

[1:26:10] if the if the technician will put it up
[1:26:12] for us or read it from your bible

[1:26:39] verse 3
[1:26:40] but thou art holy
[1:26:43] all thou that inhabited the praises of
[1:26:46] israel first of all
[1:26:48] our fathers trusted in thee
[1:26:51] they trusted and now they deliver them
[1:26:56] verse 5
[1:26:57] they cry unto thee
[1:27:00] and were delivered
[1:27:01] they trusted in thee and will not
[1:27:04] confound it
[1:27:06] we will stop right there
[1:27:07] heavenly father
[1:27:09] bless the words o god
[1:27:12] to our house now in jesus name amen the
[1:27:15] lord bless you you may have your seed
[1:27:17] been talking on the harmony of the
[1:27:19] father in the sun
[1:27:21] and
[1:27:22] i mean that was the only inspiration
[1:27:24] that was on my heart so i took it all
[1:27:25] through the meetings there in in south
[1:27:28] in zimbabwe
[1:27:30] tokyo the first service the second
[1:27:32] service and uh
[1:27:33] and but i thought i could just preach it
[1:27:36] you know all the the three days meetings
[1:27:38] but
[1:27:39] just like i said those people they rub
[1:27:41] you off all your notes
[1:27:43] you know
[1:27:44] you'll just be standing there now amen
[1:27:47] you just be standing there that's a
[1:27:48] beautiful thing that uh that uh you know
[1:27:50] that i observed
[1:27:52] and and i i did not pay a lot of
[1:27:56] attention to it but
[1:27:57] after a while
[1:28:00] we were having a lunch after one of the
[1:28:02] service and and the pastor wanted me to
[1:28:05] address the ministers and their wife
[1:28:07] talk to them a little bit appreciate
[1:28:09] them for the work that they are doing
[1:28:11] and i mean i was just i was i was just
[1:28:14] so humble to realize that many of those
[1:28:16] men were preaching before even i was i
[1:28:19] was some of them i have been preaching
[1:28:20] before i was born you know i mean all
[1:28:22] the men and all of that i was very
[1:28:24] humbled by that but uh uh uh and i was
[1:28:28] and it was also an encouragement
[1:28:30] but then after then one of the brother
[1:28:33] asked me
[1:28:34] he said brother warner
[1:28:36] in in west africa
[1:28:38] are you uh are you is there more of a
[1:28:42] teaching ministry
[1:28:43] or a evangelistic ministry
[1:28:47] i had to pause for a while
[1:28:50] before i answer him yeah i started
[1:28:52] running my mind around and says well let
[1:28:54] me see the general approach so what he
[1:28:57] was talking about is the approach
[1:29:01] you go to certain places there is a
[1:29:03] general approach
[1:29:05] the general approach is evangelistical
[1:29:08] so all the preachers turn out to be you
[1:29:10] know rebuking whatever his pastor is
[1:29:12] evangelii is teacher you know they go
[1:29:14] with that approach
[1:29:16] you know
[1:29:17] uh uh so it actually make me to think
[1:29:21] because
[1:29:22] uh what what i saw uh for for the group
[1:29:26] of brothers that i was with on the
[1:29:27] weekend some of them preach some of them
[1:29:30] you know they did a full running they
[1:29:31] would come take 15 minutes before the
[1:29:33] preacher comes
[1:29:35] what i what i saw was that they had a
[1:29:37] ministry of putting the people in the
[1:29:39] promise
[1:29:41] you know god said i will restore you
[1:29:44] know he will restore your family he will
[1:29:46] restore your job he's putting them in
[1:29:48] the promise
[1:29:50] and i'm telling you those things take
[1:29:52] the people from their feet and they are
[1:29:54] all running to the pulpit all young
[1:29:56] babies they are all running to the
[1:29:57] pulpit trying to get their restoration
[1:30:00] from the preacher
[1:30:04] praise the lord
[1:30:05] amen i i i see uh uh uh a little girl
[1:30:09] there i think maybe about it like the
[1:30:11] age of redeemed she came to the pulpit
[1:30:13] and she she had her hands up you know
[1:30:16] and i'm preaching and i'm preaching and
[1:30:18] i look at this little i say okay little
[1:30:20] baby you take what you want
[1:30:26] you know what then
[1:30:28] and i just i just appreciate that you
[1:30:30] know i just appreciate that because
[1:30:32] there is nothing that we as ministers
[1:30:34] can do for you
[1:30:36] just to remind you or tell you that it's
[1:30:39] already done it's given to you you take
[1:30:41] it it's yours
[1:30:45] and we have to identify it we have to
[1:30:48] identify the blessings in our age
[1:30:53] it's not me coming and shouting and
[1:30:55] saying cut your hair this will wear your
[1:30:57] neck tight this way and that yeah i mean
[1:30:59] you put your trouser up and then i mean
[1:31:02] i
[1:31:05] praise the lord sometimes it's needed
[1:31:11] sometimes it's needed sometimes the
[1:31:13] spirit of god goes that way and rebuke
[1:31:15] the people
[1:31:25] praise the lord
[1:31:27] so we were talking about the harmony of
[1:31:29] the father and his son it's almost 12 30
[1:31:32] years so i get 10 minutes to preach to
[1:31:34] you
[1:31:35] the harmony of the father and the son
[1:31:38] jesus said i do nothing brother branham
[1:31:41] we read this over and over brother
[1:31:43] branham tagama's church age he says now
[1:31:45] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:31:47] son jesus never did anything
[1:31:50] until it was first shown him by the
[1:31:53] father now so we talk a lot of types to
[1:31:56] be able to show you david and saul
[1:31:59] and and how david was like a son
[1:32:03] now one of the things studying this
[1:32:05] subject one of the things that struck me
[1:32:07] was
[1:32:08] i i got caught up in the the lamentation
[1:32:13] of of of the hebrews
[1:32:16] now brother man make us to know that
[1:32:18] when the hebrew mother cry
[1:32:20] at birth pain
[1:32:22] amen
[1:32:23] she's prophesying over the destiny of
[1:32:26] her son
[1:32:28] oh judah
[1:32:31] she's prophesying over the destiny of
[1:32:33] her son
[1:32:35] now and and then he said this
[1:32:39] lord be to god
[1:32:41] amen
[1:32:48] praise the lord
[1:33:01] now he said this
[1:33:07] do i have it
[1:33:16] i pick a quote up that i did sheared
[1:33:20] where brother branham
[1:33:22] uh
[1:33:28] i think i use that
[1:33:35] okay
[1:33:36] but what what brother branham said
[1:33:39] yeah uh he was he was trying to show
[1:33:42] is that
[1:33:44] uh he talks of uh
[1:33:46] the
[1:33:47] the
[1:33:48] how those hebrews
[1:33:50] he says the the
[1:33:53] the
[1:33:54] the hebrew fathers
[1:33:57] at the end how how jacob
[1:34:00] when he was placing his sons
[1:34:03] he prophesied
[1:34:05] amen
[1:34:07] placing those sons in the exact place of
[1:34:10] their birth stone
[1:34:12] which means the the prophecy of the
[1:34:14] hebrew mother
[1:34:16] was exactly what the mother prophesied
[1:34:20] over the boy when he came to the place
[1:34:22] for the father to depart
[1:34:25] when he called him
[1:34:28] he placed them
[1:34:31] positionally
[1:34:33] praise the lord now follow me in a
[1:34:35] little bit here now uh you you can see
[1:34:37] that he then brother branham referred to
[1:34:39] genesis chapter 49 where we would go to
[1:34:42] where joseph was placing all of his sons
[1:34:45] now what what i want you to see or
[1:34:48] capture in your mind
[1:34:50] is that
[1:34:52] at the time
[1:34:53] were the the the the hebrew songs you
[1:34:56] think about uh
[1:34:57] isa coming back to jacob
[1:35:01] and realizing that uh uh
[1:35:04] coming back to isaac and realizing that
[1:35:06] jacob has taken the blessing
[1:35:09] and he says is there not is there not no
[1:35:12] blessing for me i believe that as as as
[1:35:16] isaac said those last word over easter
[1:35:20] i believe he was weeping
[1:35:25] amen
[1:35:26] he was weeping
[1:35:29] so what i want to grab your mind here is
[1:35:31] that if the hebrew mother
[1:35:34] in childbirth they are also weeping
[1:35:38] honor they are cry
[1:35:40] they are prophesying over their sons
[1:35:43] and the hebrew fathers when they are
[1:35:45] about to leave
[1:35:47] and they call their sons to bless them
[1:35:50] amen
[1:35:51] it's a southern movement
[1:35:57] and the hebrew father are also weeping
[1:36:01] positionally placing the sun in the
[1:36:04] right place
[1:36:06] now what i want us to look at this
[1:36:08] morning is the position of the hebrew
[1:36:10] songs
[1:36:14] we saw that david webb the bible said he
[1:36:18] rent his clothes all daughters of israel
[1:36:21] don't let them know don't let the
[1:36:23] philistines know about it
[1:36:26] praise the lord
[1:36:28] amen but we find out
[1:36:31] that in the lamentation of david
[1:36:34] he says some things
[1:36:37] referring to the father saul
[1:36:40] he identified saw ministry
[1:36:44] he identified the benefit that saw broad
[1:36:47] to israel
[1:36:49] he said remember he clothed you he won
[1:36:52] battles for you
[1:36:54] he and jonathan they were blessing in
[1:36:56] their lives
[1:36:58] praise the lord
[1:36:59] they were swifter than like like ego
[1:37:02] they were stronger like than
[1:37:04] lions
[1:37:05] so he identified
[1:37:08] the characteristic of the father
[1:37:11] because saul was the king of israel
[1:37:15] he was standing in a place of the father
[1:37:17] of the nation
[1:37:20] now we look at elijah and elisha
[1:37:23] when
[1:37:25] sorry
[1:37:26] when elijah was going away
[1:37:30] when he took up
[1:37:34] read the scripture now the bible says
[1:37:36] there was a chariot of fire
[1:37:39] that came
[1:37:40] and went between elijah and elisha
[1:37:45] and it picked elijah up
[1:37:49] praise the lord
[1:37:51] such a speed
[1:37:54] that chariot of fire pick him up
[1:37:57] with such a speed
[1:38:00] are we together and he turned he said my
[1:38:03] father my father
[1:38:05] the chariot of israel and the husband
[1:38:08] thereof
[1:38:11] but we realized that before a couple of
[1:38:14] days
[1:38:16] before that experience whether it was
[1:38:17] couple of days on that after elijah knew
[1:38:21] that they were coming
[1:38:23] ring from heaven
[1:38:25] he told elijah you go out
[1:38:28] and look at because there's going to be
[1:38:30] abundance of rain
[1:38:33] the seven went out and looked the first
[1:38:35] time there was nothing
[1:38:36] he went out and looked the second time
[1:38:38] there was nothing
[1:38:40] at the seventh time he says i see the
[1:38:43] cloud like a man's hand
[1:38:46] praise the lord
[1:38:48] amen
[1:38:49] then
[1:38:50] uh elijah now
[1:38:54] took the the the
[1:38:56] uh uh uh uh he went down i like the way
[1:39:00] brother branham said it yeah let me let
[1:39:01] me read that
[1:39:03] he says
[1:39:06] he said here he said uh
[1:39:09] in the message look he said watch elijah
[1:39:12] when he accepted it when he accepted the
[1:39:15] word of the lord you know his life must
[1:39:17] have been renewed
[1:39:21] he had reigned
[1:39:24] ahab terror
[1:39:26] he run before the terror
[1:39:30] when he couldn't even climb a hill
[1:39:34] in his physical strength he can't even
[1:39:36] go up a hill
[1:39:40] but when he had that experience
[1:39:42] his life changed that he had such a
[1:39:46] speed
[1:39:47] to iran
[1:39:49] the president motorcade
[1:39:54] praise the lord amen amen
[1:39:57] he has such a speech so when elisha
[1:40:01] was crying out my father my father
[1:40:05] what he saw with his eyes
[1:40:08] praise the lord
[1:40:10] a natural man
[1:40:12] having the speed more than a cherub
[1:40:16] so he was crying and saying
[1:40:19] that you
[1:40:21] are the chariot of israel
[1:40:23] your ministry
[1:40:26] praise the lord
[1:40:28] let's look at it in the scripture
[1:40:30] when every time the syrians were
[1:40:32] gathering
[1:40:34] to attack israel
[1:40:37] praise the lord was it the army that was
[1:40:39] defending them or was it was said the
[1:40:41] prophet
[1:40:44] it was the prophet
[1:40:46] because the army israel army they are
[1:40:49] there you
[1:40:51] you you
[1:40:52] you you but they don't know where the
[1:40:54] army is coming from
[1:40:55] they don't know where the syrians are
[1:40:57] coming from
[1:40:59] elijah wake up in the morning he says
[1:41:01] boy go and tell the king
[1:41:05] praise the lord
[1:41:06] go and tell the king
[1:41:08] so where is the horseman who was the
[1:41:10] horseman
[1:41:13] it was not the natural army that was the
[1:41:15] horseman it was the ministry of the
[1:41:17] prophet
[1:41:18] the ministry of the prophet was the
[1:41:21] powerhouse
[1:41:24] it's not the multitude of the people in
[1:41:27] the church it's the ministry you are
[1:41:29] setting honor and the ministry is the
[1:41:32] ministry of malachi 4.
[1:41:34] [Applause]
[1:41:35] that's the powerhouse of the church
[1:41:39] it's not how many armies you have
[1:41:42] so elijah as a son
[1:41:45] was identifying the ministry of elijah
[1:41:49] and said you are the chair of israel
[1:41:55] you are the husband thereof oh my father
[1:41:59] you being gone we are dead
[1:42:04] because nobody to tell the american
[1:42:06] where the syrians are coming from
[1:42:14] my goodness
[1:42:15] praise the lord
[1:42:17] hallelujah
[1:42:26] how will we have known serpent seed
[1:42:28] right right
[1:42:30] praise the lord
[1:42:32] how will we have known that right
[1:42:34] baptism
[1:42:36] that it is not in it is not only in
[1:42:38] jesus name but in the name of the lord
[1:42:40] jesus christ
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:45] how will we have known that the white
[1:42:47] house rather is an antichrist
[1:42:49] how will we have known
[1:42:51] my father my father the sheriff of
[1:42:54] israel
[1:42:55] he was the powerhouse
[1:42:59] he was the safety of the nation
[1:43:10] so just like the hebrew mother
[1:43:13] were prophesied in their cry
[1:43:16] and the hebrew father where we
[1:43:18] positionally place in the sun
[1:43:21] when it comes to the sun when they whip
[1:43:23] over their father
[1:43:24] they identify
[1:43:28] they identify the ministry of the father
[1:43:31] they identify the importance of the
[1:43:34] father
[1:43:36] genesis chapter 50.
[1:43:41] let's talk in our bibles
[1:43:45] i wish i had a voice this morning to
[1:43:46] preach
[1:43:48] hey amen
[1:43:49] glory be to god you want to borrow me
[1:43:51] your voice junior
[1:43:56] amen
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:44:01] glory be to god
[1:44:03] there are things that brother branham
[1:44:05] taught us
[1:44:09] people i'm telling you this this is not
[1:44:11] a theological school
[1:44:13] it's not a theological school
[1:44:15] that's why the prophet of god said in
[1:44:17] the church book those faithful men need
[1:44:19] to be they need to sit down and learn
[1:44:22] yes it's not just reading bunch of cults
[1:44:26] this was a message to a generation
[1:44:43] he says that same harmony
[1:44:45] that existed between the father and the
[1:44:47] son
[1:44:48] is now existing
[1:44:51] between
[1:44:52] the groom
[1:44:54] and the bride
[1:44:59] is now
[1:45:00] existing but it just don't come easy
[1:45:05] it's not just easier for parents and
[1:45:07] children to be in harmony
[1:45:09] no the age difference is it's fine
[1:45:13] the parents want the child to be
[1:45:14] responsible the child wants to play
[1:45:18] because the play play is in the chat
[1:45:21] it's the nature of the child
[1:45:22] so it takes working together it takes
[1:45:26] working together you got to work
[1:45:27] together work together build confidence
[1:45:30] in the child
[1:45:32] believing that they are doing the right
[1:45:33] thing their child bearing confidence in
[1:45:36] their parents knowing that my parents
[1:45:38] have a good intention for me so over the
[1:45:41] years that's how harmony is built it's
[1:45:43] not built overnight
[1:45:45] [Music]
[1:45:46] [Applause]
[1:45:51] even in our marriages harmony is not
[1:45:54] built overnight
[1:45:59] it's not bill overnight
[1:46:01] i'm your husband you must listen to me
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:13] i took a salmon
[1:46:15] from an old preacher
[1:46:17] but i have to wait for many years to
[1:46:19] preach it
[1:46:22] amen
[1:46:27] i will tell you the top title
[1:46:31] because you you
[1:46:32] you message people you are too smart
[1:46:37] praise the
[1:46:38] lord amen
[1:46:42] amen okay i said genesis chapter 15.
[1:46:45] i was lost in the little baby
[1:46:47] genesis chapter 49 the bible says dear
[1:46:50] jacob
[1:46:52] give up the ghost
[1:46:55] amen
[1:46:57] am i right
[1:47:03] genesis chapter 49.
[1:47:08] i read the last verse verse 33
[1:47:11] and when jacob had made an end of
[1:47:14] commanding his sons
[1:47:16] placing them in their inheritance
[1:47:19] the very thing that their mother cried
[1:47:21] over them from the beginning
[1:47:26] at the end
[1:47:27] the father
[1:47:29] is pleasing them
[1:47:37] and when jacob had made an end of
[1:47:40] commanding his sons
[1:47:42] he gathered up his feet
[1:47:45] into the bed
[1:47:48] in the year of the ghost
[1:47:51] and were gathered to his people
[1:47:55] chapter 50 verse 1.
[1:47:58] all the songs are sitting right there
[1:48:01] he called them one by one and he blessed
[1:48:03] him
[1:48:07] the scripture says and and joseph
[1:48:11] fell
[1:48:13] upon his father's face
[1:48:20] he fell upon his father's face and he
[1:48:22] wept
[1:48:24] upon him
[1:48:26] and kissed him
[1:48:28] praise god
[1:48:30] and what i can hear
[1:48:32] by the echo in my ear
[1:48:35] i hear joseph saying my father my father
[1:48:41] i hear him saying my father
[1:48:43] my father
[1:48:45] you have to realize that he had a
[1:48:47] relationship
[1:48:53] that was broken
[1:48:57] praise the lord
[1:49:01] and now he has sent for his brothers
[1:49:03] and his father
[1:49:05] and they have come down and all in egypt
[1:49:09] and the father is old
[1:49:13] and he called his sons
[1:49:16] and he's whipping
[1:49:17] ruby
[1:49:18] about my first born
[1:49:21] he went into my country did levi
[1:49:25] talked to this one hesitant he talked to
[1:49:28] this one
[1:49:30] praise the lord
[1:49:33] he said joseph
[1:49:35] bring me your two boys
[1:49:42] joseph brought his sons
[1:49:50] and as he's putting his hands on it he
[1:49:52] crossed his hands
[1:49:54] joseph said lord that i said he said he
[1:49:57] says let it be so son
[1:50:00] almighty god crossed my head
[1:50:09] and as he's doing that he's whipping
[1:50:11] over his sons
[1:50:13] and they have all witness the bible say
[1:50:15] he gathered his feet in the bed
[1:50:18] he laid down
[1:50:21] and he gave up the cause
[1:50:27] joseph fell on his death
[1:50:30] and he's whipping
[1:50:32] and what i can hear joseph saying my god
[1:50:35] my god
[1:50:36] why have they forsaken me
[1:50:44] praise the lord
[1:50:47] oh
[1:50:47] man
[1:50:55] the bible says and joseph fell upon his
[1:50:57] father face and wept upon him
[1:51:00] and kiss him
[1:51:03] praise the lord
[1:51:05] and then he instructed the physician
[1:51:08] let's go back to psalm chapter 22 as we
[1:51:10] find a place to close here
[1:51:12] we cannot preach all one night
[1:51:19] but i prayed and hope that
[1:51:21] the holy ghost
[1:51:24] will be able to say something to you
[1:51:25] this morning
[1:51:28] this is david
[1:51:31] on a prophecy
[1:51:34] saying my god my god why have that
[1:51:36] forsaken me
[1:51:40] why are thou so far from me
[1:51:42] now
[1:51:43] this
[1:51:45] this statement
[1:51:48] this statement
[1:51:53] is the people that are around david and
[1:51:56] have saw
[1:51:57] the many things that he have done
[1:52:00] there might be trouble in their mind why
[1:52:02] is he saying this
[1:52:04] god has been so gracious to him
[1:52:10] but because it was a prophecy
[1:52:14] they couldn't understand what it was
[1:52:17] praise the lord
[1:52:19] i believe even david himself did not
[1:52:21] understood what he said
[1:52:25] because when a man is caught up under
[1:52:27] the child of the holy ghost you don't
[1:52:30] process your thoughts as you want him
[1:52:33] god take complete control
[1:52:36] amen
[1:52:38] but i want for us to follow this oh my
[1:52:40] god i cried
[1:52:42] in the dead time i die here at midnight
[1:52:44] in the night season i'm solid
[1:52:47] but our holy
[1:52:49] and you inhabit the praise of your
[1:52:50] people
[1:52:52] now this is what i want you not to
[1:52:54] forget
[1:52:55] our fathers
[1:52:57] trusted
[1:52:59] in thee
[1:53:05] they trusted and thou
[1:53:07] deliver
[1:53:09] them
[1:53:12] the son can do nothing
[1:53:15] the son can do nothing
[1:53:18] except what the father
[1:53:20] show him
[1:53:22] what the father reveal what the father
[1:53:24] does through him
[1:53:26] so when jesus was on the cross
[1:53:30] saying my god my god why had that
[1:53:33] forsaken me he was not crying because he
[1:53:35] was defeated
[1:53:40] the sun can do nothing
[1:53:45] keep that at the back of your mind
[1:53:47] the sun can do nothing
[1:53:50] except that which the father
[1:53:53] revealed unto him
[1:53:56] jesus was exactly on the spirit of
[1:53:59] prophecy that was on david when he said
[1:54:01] when he read the song
[1:54:05] praise the lord
[1:54:06] now the position of the son
[1:54:10] when he's crying out to his father
[1:54:12] the same way david crying out because
[1:54:16] saul was there he identified the
[1:54:19] ministry of saul the same way elijah
[1:54:22] crying out he identified the ministry of
[1:54:25] the prophet elijah
[1:54:29] my god my god why have that forsaken me
[1:54:35] it was not a cry of despise it was not a
[1:54:37] cry because he was abundant
[1:54:40] it was not a cry of rejection it was not
[1:54:42] a crime of failure
[1:54:44] but once again the son
[1:54:49] was identifying something
[1:54:54] and david said it all yeah
[1:54:56] in this
[1:54:57] let's read down a little bit you will
[1:54:59] find out
[1:55:00] what was happening
[1:55:02] our father trusted in day
[1:55:05] they trusted
[1:55:07] and doubted delivered him
[1:55:09] they cried
[1:55:11] and were delivered they trusted in them
[1:55:15] praise the lord
[1:55:17] says
[1:55:19] but i am a worm
[1:55:21] and no man
[1:55:23] i'm a warm i'm not a man
[1:55:26] man that's a deep saying
[1:55:30] he says i'm not a human i'm a warm
[1:55:33] well we get back to that
[1:55:36] sometimes
[1:55:37] you see all they that see me alive me
[1:55:39] just come
[1:55:42] they shout out
[1:55:44] the lips they shake their hair saying
[1:55:47] he
[1:55:48] trusted
[1:55:50] oh my god
[1:55:52] yes the word play out again
[1:55:55] that is the very important word for any
[1:55:58] form of harmony
[1:56:01] you can never achieve harmony without
[1:56:04] trust
[1:56:12] praise the lord
[1:56:15] my god my god why have that forsaken me
[1:56:20] you know why he said that because he
[1:56:22] trusted in him
[1:56:24] sure
[1:56:27] praise the lord
[1:56:30] you see there's a trust in a reverse way
[1:56:35] because god
[1:56:37] trusted us
[1:56:39] for this age
[1:56:43] praise the lord
[1:56:45] he could have brought you in luther days
[1:56:47] he can brought you in poor days
[1:56:50] but he trusted you for this age
[1:56:53] it's now for us to return that trust
[1:56:55] back
[1:56:59] god trusted his only begotten son born
[1:57:03] of a virgin
[1:57:05] to take
[1:57:06] the sin of the world upon his shoulder
[1:57:09] he was trusted to do that
[1:57:13] brother branham said he had a choice
[1:57:16] when he whipped in gogota
[1:57:18] he had a choice to say i can take this
[1:57:23] but he knew the father trusted him to go
[1:57:26] through this
[1:57:28] in whatever trials you're going through
[1:57:30] god trusted you
[1:57:31] and you will never be successful until
[1:57:33] you return that trust back to him and
[1:57:36] say god you trusted me i trust you that
[1:57:39] you will bring me through this
[1:57:42] amen
[1:57:48] glory to god
[1:57:50] praise the lord
[1:57:52] i know you're sitting down looking at me
[1:57:54] like some kind of a spectator
[1:57:56] but that's okay
[1:57:58] amen
[1:58:01] i'm not intimidated
[1:58:08] praise the lord
[1:58:11] because that is the ground of trust
[1:58:13] brother brandon said yeah let me pick
[1:58:14] this up satan's eating
[1:58:17] i'm almost out of time he says
[1:58:19] god was so satisfied
[1:58:22] till he just went back
[1:58:24] and rested from all his works that's
[1:58:27] genesis
[1:58:28] every tree never brought forth tongues
[1:58:31] and teslas
[1:58:34] no berry ever come out
[1:58:36] of town street
[1:58:38] everything
[1:58:39] was
[1:58:40] perfect
[1:58:42] all seas were perfect everything was
[1:58:44] kept was in perfect condition
[1:58:47] then when he went and take a little rest
[1:58:51] his enemies slip in
[1:58:54] with a deceit
[1:58:57] and took it over
[1:59:00] by
[1:59:00] misinterpreting his program to his
[1:59:03] children
[1:59:05] listen now
[1:59:07] when he put trust in his own child
[1:59:13] amen
[1:59:15] he went to rest why because he trusted
[1:59:18] his son
[1:59:21] that he will not be deceived
[1:59:30] that was the harmony between the father
[1:59:32] and the son
[1:59:34] it was trust
[1:59:41] praise the lord
[1:59:43] amen
[1:59:48] when the enemy starts sowing distrust
[1:59:52] among god's people
[1:59:55] where we become so suspicious of one
[1:59:57] another
[2:00:00] that's what the church failed
[2:00:03] you will always feel on that ground
[2:00:05] because you are leaning to your own
[2:00:07] understanding
[2:00:13] when he starts sawing distrust in the
[2:00:15] home
[2:00:18] praise the lord
[2:00:20] if god don't help you
[2:00:22] you find yourself in in the divorce
[2:00:24] court
[2:00:29] trust
[2:00:31] is the ground of harmony
[2:00:45] when he put trust in his own child
[2:00:48] as you put trust in your daughter
[2:00:51] when she goes out tonight with a man
[2:00:54] when you put trust in your son when he
[2:00:57] has to go
[2:00:58] with with a drunken boy
[2:01:00] or a smoking boy
[2:01:02] praise the lord
[2:01:04] you don't ask you don't ask your your
[2:01:05] children when you go to school for their
[2:01:07] friend's baptismal certificate
[2:01:09] do you ask them
[2:01:11] that boy you are bringing bring me his
[2:01:13] baptism and said let me make sure that
[2:01:15] he's baptized
[2:01:17] right
[2:01:19] you should not be you you should not
[2:01:21] worry about the boy
[2:01:23] it must be your son right you must trust
[2:01:26] him
[2:01:28] you cannot trust him enough if you don't
[2:01:30] train him enough
[2:01:32] so the problem don't come on the child
[2:01:34] it comes back to you
[2:01:36] [Applause]
[2:01:39] you don't have trust because you have
[2:01:40] not you haven't invested enough
[2:01:54] oh you ask your husband honey
[2:01:56] all your work made then you find out
[2:01:58] whether they
[2:01:59] believe jesus
[2:02:03] i just want to know that you're in a
[2:02:04] safe place
[2:02:06] because the atmosphere mattered
[2:02:11] do they believe in jesus
[2:02:13] are you testifying of the message
[2:02:28] he put trust in his son
[2:02:31] that he would not do anything wrong
[2:02:37] god putting trust in his son
[2:02:43] when jesus said my god my god he was
[2:02:46] saying i have trust you
[2:02:49] i have trust you
[2:02:52] i have done everything you say
[2:02:59] reason 22.
[2:03:07] he trusted
[2:03:10] verse 8 on the law that he will deliver
[2:03:12] him
[2:03:13] let him deliver him is that not what
[2:03:15] those people say right
[2:03:17] that he trusted in the lord
[2:03:28] praise the lord
[2:03:31] amen
[2:03:35] glory be to god
[2:03:39] i'm getting out of time here

[2:03:45] time and read the sign and see what is
[2:03:47] happening there

[2:04:06] a supernatural series in my
[2:04:08] vehicle and
[2:04:12] a testimony
[2:04:14] of brother branham
[2:04:16] when he built his den room
[2:04:20] he called
[2:04:23] brother daughter to help him arrange his
[2:04:25] dead room and put his guns to the to all
[2:04:28] the places that he wanted his guns to be

[2:05:26] names there but i know who sent it

[2:06:56] or a daughter of god
[2:06:58] he was not trusting the nation you will
[2:07:00] come from
[2:07:02] all the family you will be born in
[2:07:05] praise the lord
[2:07:08] the bible says because he has put his
[2:07:10] trust upon him

[2:07:43] that almighty god that has separated us
[2:07:45] from our mother's womb
[2:07:49] and kept us till this time

[2:08:10] right who gave you that desire
[2:08:15] have you ever sat down to think why they
[2:08:18] don't have it
[2:08:23] that god will trust you
[2:08:27] with a desire to long after him
[2:08:30] and he will sit there for you to just
[2:08:32] long
[2:08:34] and not be able to meet that desire
[2:08:37] and not be able to feel that that
[2:08:39] longing in your heart
[2:08:42] you know why you think that way because
[2:08:44] you don't trust him
[2:08:47] you don't trust him you are trusting
[2:08:48] your religious knowledge
[2:08:51] you are trusting your association and
[2:08:53] which church you belong to and who's
[2:08:54] your pastor but if you trust god brother
[2:08:57] branham said that the deep color to the
[2:08:59] deep the rest of thee being able to
[2:09:00] respond
[2:09:05] if there's a true desire in your heart
[2:09:06] for god god there is a living god
[2:09:09] that can grant that desire
[2:09:11] [Music]
[2:09:28] because he trusted in me
[2:09:32] i would deliver him
[2:09:34] because he trusted me
[2:09:38] where was where was the secret of
[2:09:42] something
[2:09:43] strength
[2:09:47] he trusted the seven lots
[2:09:51] the philistines could come anyway and
[2:09:53] bound him anyway
[2:09:55] he just need to shake it
[2:09:57] right
[2:09:58] praise the lord
[2:10:00] he never went and put some kind of oil
[2:10:02] in his hair to grow a
[2:10:05] raster head
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:08] he was born with it
[2:10:10] it was given to him
[2:10:14] god trusted him with a divine gift
[2:10:20] that he's eating in a mess of wrong
[2:10:24] he's lying with a philistine girl on the
[2:10:26] bed
[2:10:29] but as long as you feel his head
[2:10:32] and know that the seven watch is there
[2:10:35] almighty god will come down
[2:10:37] and deliver him amen
[2:10:41] we have become so theological inclined
[2:10:45] we fill our mind with a bunch of
[2:10:46] conditions
[2:10:48] that you're not giving the holy ghost a
[2:10:50] will to move in your life you're not
[2:10:52] giving him a liberty to move to deliver
[2:10:55] you and set you free
[2:10:57] because you have filled your mind with a
[2:10:58] bunch of
[2:11:00] a religious condition
[2:11:13] if god
[2:11:15] put his trust upon a man
[2:11:19] if god trusts you
[2:11:22] god trusted a runaway prophet
[2:11:26] he trusted moses that he wouldn't give
[2:11:28] him a stick
[2:11:30] to go and deliver his people
[2:11:40] praise the lord
[2:11:45] let the age become evil let sin rise
[2:11:51] god trusts you to give you the holy
[2:11:53] ghost
[2:11:55] to give you the new birth
[2:11:58] why because he's determined to have sons
[2:12:00] and daughters in this age
[2:12:02] no matter how evil they become
[2:12:06] let the whole world script themselves
[2:12:08] naked god's children will still be
[2:12:10] clothed in righteousness
[2:12:12] [Applause]
[2:12:23] what are we afraid of
[2:12:26] what are we afraid of
[2:12:30] amen
[2:12:31] are you coming to this church
[2:12:34] looking at my abilities
[2:12:36] you have to be trusting in god
[2:12:40] praise the lord amen
[2:12:43] amen we trusted the lord that's why we
[2:12:45] left those doors open
[2:12:48] and as long as we stay here that doors
[2:12:50] will remain open
[2:12:52] they will come in and they will go out
[2:13:05] look through all the scripture
[2:13:11] the bible says the pro the father of the
[2:13:13] prodigal son
[2:13:14] read the scripture very well
