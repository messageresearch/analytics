[43:33] just glad to that have Brother Juan so
[43:37] open to uh us coming for such a long
[43:39] time be able to share my small gift with
[43:42] you that I could be a blessing in some
[43:45] way to the church and to your Outreach
[43:47] here so praise the lord we don't have to
[43:50] take very much time to catch up and get
[43:52] to know one another we share the same
[43:54] common uh faith and also uh the love for
[43:57] the Lord Jesus Christ and we appreciate
[44:00] God and what he's done in our lives so
[44:02] far by his mercy and by his grace we
[44:04] stand tonight and um I remember this
[44:07] building coming before Brother Juan was
[44:09] here and uh when you didn't have a
[44:12] pastor and preaching here I don't know
[44:14] it's been 12 13 years ago maybe and uh
[44:17] the testimony for me was is that uh we
[44:20] were in a service one night like this
[44:22] Saturday night I think it was and and I
[44:25] don't think the brother would mind me
[44:27] mentioning this testimony but uh he was
[44:30] back in a kind of a backsliding
[44:32] condition and uh he came that night with
[44:35] a specific purpose Young Brother with a
[44:38] specific purpose to uh get all the young
[44:41] people to go to a movie after service
[44:43] because he was really working against
[44:45] what was going on and backslid and so he
[44:48] came to the service to invite all the
[44:50] youth to go to a movie afterwards that
[44:51] was his agenda well God had different
[44:54] plans that night amen and God got a hold
[44:56] of of him I don't know if he's told the
[44:58] testimony here and it really wasn't my
[45:00] sermon as much as uh one statement that
[45:03] I made and uh it's really comes from
[45:06] brother brandom and he said I said that
[45:08] uh you know if we if I serve the Lord
[45:11] all my life and I found out at the end
[45:13] that God would send me to hell or I
[45:14] found out this wasn't true I would still
[45:17] serve the Lord with all my heart because
[45:19] we're undeserving without his grace we
[45:22] still owe him and my dad always used to
[45:24] say that there's no better way to raise
[45:26] your family and under the headship of
[45:28] this message and was message even if we
[45:30] found out at the end it wasn't true I
[45:33] believe it is true am my soul says it's
[45:36] true uh my relationship with the Lord
[45:38] Jesus Christ says it's true because he
[45:41] is true and it's not about just brother
[45:44] brandom to me it's about the Lord that I
[45:46] met through the
[45:47] message and I said that statement over
[45:49] and over again that night and he got so
[45:51] mad at me this brother he just couldn't
[45:53] he said these people are absolutely
[45:55] crazy to serve the Lord their whole life
[45:58] and then to find out maybe it's not true
[46:00] and he would serve the Lord anyway so he
[46:02] went out that night he followed through
[46:04] with his plans he influenced some to go
[46:06] to the movie theater continued several
[46:08] months maybe a year or so in Rebellion
[46:10] but he said his testimony is is I
[46:12] couldn't get away from that crazy
[46:15] statement that you made in the pfit I
[46:18] could not get away from it and God
[46:21] stayed with it and stayed with him
[46:22] stayed with and today he's serving the
[46:24] Lord with all of his heart him and his
[46:26] family and so I give glory to God Amen
[46:29] you don't know what God is
[46:31] doing and so I I love I love uh just
[46:35] services like this because you don't
[46:37] know what God is going to do in the
[46:40] simple things and in the simple words so
[46:42] be open to the Lord tonight and uh I
[46:45] have no special gift I just want to lend
[46:47] my fellowship with your pastor I have
[46:49] got to know him a little bit as being a
[46:51] true shepherd and a true pastor and has
[46:54] a pastor's heart and that is important
[46:56] today we have many other ministers but
[46:58] we need true Pastor Hearts to guide us
[47:02] and that's if you have that you should
[47:03] cherish it hold on to it support him
[47:06] with all of your heart and give him all
[47:08] your support because we need that in
[47:09] today God said in I think it's Ezekiel
[47:12] I'll give you Shepherds according to my
[47:14] heart am and God's certainly providing
[47:16] that that's for sure amen well I'm going
[47:19] to uh brother ask us to sing a little
[47:21] bit so uh if you don't mind maybe I'll
[47:24] sing just a little bit before I preach
[47:26] and and uh unless you want to play for
[47:29] me then uh I'm going to kick you
[47:31] off amen praise the

[58:35] glad to make the it's I'm glad to make
[58:37] the just to get together connect again
[58:40] and get to know everybody there was some
[58:41] there today that are not here tonight
[58:43] but it was a privilege to be able to see
[58:45] them to be able to uh fellowship with
[58:47] them again just uh being away many many
[58:50] years from this area it was good to see
[58:51] some old friends from Brother Hoffman's
[58:54] and also some other ones as well so
[58:56] we've known my my wife was friends there
[58:59] with s what was her first name sister
[59:01] Karen uh Schwarz many years before she
[59:04] was even married and I think it's been
[59:06] 25 30 years since we had seen them
[59:08] brother Greg and so it was such a joy
[59:10] and see Sister Laura here tonight God
[59:12] bless you you and your family God bless
[59:14] you it's good to see you all praise the
[59:16] Lord God is good amen all the time we
[59:19] appreciate his glory in our lives and we
[59:22] appreciate his goodness in our lives and
[59:25] uh just to see
[59:26] um many years that God has kept us by
[59:28] his grace and I think that's a wonderful
[59:31] thing I think God is uh certainly doing
[59:34] things and I want to speak a little bit
[59:35] about that tonight maybe doing in a
[59:38] doing things in a way that we wouldn't
[59:39] expect in unexpected ways and we should
[59:42] never underestimate what God is doing in
[59:44] our lives can you say amen amen we
[59:46] should never underestimate what the Lord
[59:48] can do and and just to be able to uh I'm
[59:53] just looking for trying to pull up I
[59:54] pulled that song up and I'm trying to to
[59:56] pull I wonder if the Deacon could grab
[59:58] my phone so I could have something here
[59:59] to be able to grab my notes and and do
[1:00:02] that I would appreciate it we want to
[1:00:03] turn tonight if you would to Deuteronomy
[1:00:05] chapter 30 and if the Deacon could grab
[1:00:08] my phone I'll try to hook this in here
[1:00:11] with the Internet or
[1:00:13] something praise the Lord I Brothers had
[1:00:16] bought me a different iPad there uh at
[1:00:20] home and so we're just trying to get a
[1:00:23] hold of what we need to do I'm
[1:00:25] technically challenge so that's that's
[1:00:27] the biggest problem right there praise
[1:00:29] the Lord all right here we
[1:00:31] are
[1:00:34] amen Deuteronomy if you could Chapter 30
[1:00:37] if you just turn there with me and we'll
[1:00:40] read a verse of scripture
[1:00:41] together
[1:00:46] amen verse
[1:00:49] 11 and for this commandment which I
[1:00:51] command thee this day it is not hidden
[1:00:54] from thee neither is it far off it is
[1:00:58] not in heaven that thou should us say
[1:01:01] who shall go up for us and bring it unto
[1:01:04] us that we may hear it and do it neither
[1:01:07] is it beyond the sea that thou should us
[1:01:10] say who shall go over to the Sea for us
[1:01:13] and bring it unto us that we may hear it
[1:01:17] and do it so the the theme Here is that
[1:01:19] the people probably begin to think that
[1:01:22] the word or God was a far off to them
[1:01:25] but but the word that he had brought
[1:01:27] them was not as far off as they were
[1:01:29] making it he's trying to bring it back
[1:01:31] and say it's it's closer to you than
[1:01:33] what you realize and that someone
[1:01:35] doesn't have to go and get it and bring
[1:01:37] it to you he said it's already here in
[1:01:38] fact verse 14 he says but the word is
[1:01:42] very NY unto thee in thy mouth and in
[1:01:46] thy heart that thou mayest do it so the
[1:01:49] word is closer and it needs to be it
[1:01:52] doesn't need to just be in books and
[1:01:54] tapes in our Bibles but it needs to be
[1:01:56] in our
[1:01:57] heart and it needs to be upon our lips
[1:02:00] as well and this is related to the
[1:02:03] spoken word it's related to the third
[1:02:04] pole it's related to God bringing this
[1:02:07] glory and this word that he's given us
[1:02:09] from just uh the Bible and from a
[1:02:13] prophet's word and bringing it closer to
[1:02:15] us that it's not far from us but it's
[1:02:18] something in human nature to make it
[1:02:20] distant to make God distant from us and
[1:02:22] we're waiting for something to come some
[1:02:25] for God to bring something but God has
[1:02:27] already brought everything that we need
[1:02:30] everything you need tonight is here uh
[1:02:32] and he even be once see after 63 he said
[1:02:35] the third poll is here so it's not
[1:02:38] something that's coming it's here so I
[1:02:39] want to talk about tonight the glory of
[1:02:42] God changing us personally because the
[1:02:45] word doesn't need to change and the word
[1:02:46] doesn't need to come who needs to change
[1:02:48] is us to fit the word that's already
[1:02:51] here can you say Amen praise the Lord
[1:02:54] father we just pray you bless the word
[1:02:56] tonight and may you help us to just put
[1:02:59] our shoulder to the will with these
[1:03:00] Believers and their love for you their
[1:03:02] love for the word God we live in these
[1:03:05] times Lord that's strange and different
[1:03:07] father a different uh day of Darkness
[1:03:10] that we've ever seen before and that's
[1:03:12] why we need your light to come in this
[1:03:13] room tonight and your glory to shine
[1:03:16] upon us help us to get out of the way
[1:03:18] Lord and look past all the uh the things
[1:03:21] Lord we hear and the voices that we hear
[1:03:22] in the world and on the internet help us
[1:03:24] to focus on one voice and that's the
[1:03:27] voice of Jesus Christ we commit the
[1:03:29] service and our gift to you tonight in
[1:03:31] Jesus name amen amen God bless you let's
[1:03:34] just bring in 2 Corinthians you may be
[1:03:36] seated 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and we
[1:03:39] want to add that in as we go into a
[1:03:42] little subject here tonight 2
[1:03:43] Corinthians chapter 3 and this is of
[1:03:46] course A Familiar scripture to you as
[1:03:48] well but and I won't read the whole
[1:03:50] chapter but it says in verse 18 2
[1:03:52] Corinthians chapter 3 and: 18 but we all
[1:03:55] with open face beholding is in a as in a
[1:03:59] glass the glory of the Lord what are we
[1:04:01] beholding the glory of the Lord and as
[1:04:04] we're beholding that we who's changed we
[1:04:07] are changed we are changed into the same
[1:04:11] image from glory to glory even as by the
[1:04:15] spirit of the Lord so we're looking at
[1:04:17] something the song leader is saying
[1:04:19] tonight look and live look and live
[1:04:21] we're looking at something and if we
[1:04:22] will continue to look into it then then
[1:04:25] there there's a glory within it that's
[1:04:27] changing us it's it's not that it's to
[1:04:30] change World Systems it's not to change
[1:04:32] and make life better for you
[1:04:34] economically uh even though God can
[1:04:36] bless you but it's to change us it's to
[1:04:39] change whatever is not lining up with
[1:04:42] the word whatever God wants to do
[1:04:44] through the bride in this day he has to
[1:04:46] change us to meet that expectation and
[1:04:49] so we can point our finger at everybody
[1:04:51] else and we can be critical of everybody
[1:04:53] else but as my dad used to say it's me
[1:04:56] it's me me oh Lord standing in the need
[1:04:58] of prayer we must look at the mirror of
[1:05:00] God's word and say Lord are you changing
[1:05:02] me right often preachers preach on the
[1:05:05] big change which is the rapture that's
[1:05:07] the change of our bodies but before the
[1:05:09] big change happens there has to be
[1:05:11] little changes in us and if you look at
[1:05:14] the message humble thyself brother Bram
[1:05:16] says that as God begin to change him and
[1:05:18] he said I'm going to prayer he says I I
[1:05:21] I need to I need to change I need to go
[1:05:23] before the Lord and he said I just need
[1:05:25] a little change in my life to make me
[1:05:28] more obedient make me more love people
[1:05:30] more he said I need to love people more
[1:05:33] he he he was a bit too critical of
[1:05:35] people and he says I just need a little
[1:05:37] change it's not the big change the
[1:05:38] Rapture it's little changes that lead up
[1:05:41] to the big change can you say Amen it's
[1:05:43] little changes in us that lead up to the
[1:05:46] big change we can't sit around and just
[1:05:48] wait for the big change we say we have
[1:05:50] to say God let this Glory change me and
[1:05:53] by the way the glory of the Lord always
[1:05:56] changes it it comes there to change
[1:05:59] what's there and transform it into
[1:06:01] something else every time the glory of
[1:06:04] the Lord descends which I'm praying
[1:06:06] he'll do that tonight in the service
[1:06:09] that Glory comes to change it will not
[1:06:12] leave you in the same state it's to
[1:06:15] change us when it came on the mountain
[1:06:18] with Moses there it's so affected his
[1:06:20] countenance that they had to Veil his
[1:06:22] face the people couldn't look in his
[1:06:24] face because the glory of the Lord
[1:06:26] changed his countenance they couldn't
[1:06:28] even look at him so we know that that
[1:06:32] Glory could not change the soul yet
[1:06:34] until C Calvary came but it so came down
[1:06:37] and changed his countenance that the
[1:06:39] people couldn't look at it the same
[1:06:40] Glory came in the word in this hour upon
[1:06:43] a mountain through a prophet's
[1:06:45] mouth and it's not come just to change
[1:06:48] our
[1:06:49] countenance it's come to completely
[1:06:51] change Us Praise the Lord praise the
[1:06:54] Lord
[1:06:56] I I preached enough there for us to
[1:06:57] shout yeah praise the lord it's not just
[1:07:01] to change our countenance although I
[1:07:02] will say I wish it would just change
[1:07:04] some people's countenance some Sunday
[1:07:06] mornings and some Saturday nights I wish
[1:07:08] the glory would come just to change the
[1:07:10] looks on people's faces that's right
[1:07:13] some people look like they've been
[1:07:15] baptized and prune juice sometimes they
[1:07:17] don't like like Christians at all
[1:07:18] they're not Hy they're not there's
[1:07:20] nothing but I don't want it just to
[1:07:22] change their face I don't want it just
[1:07:25] to change their dress and they dress
[1:07:26] modest this Glory has to change all of
[1:07:29] us and particularly our mindset our how
[1:07:32] we think about things this Glory can
[1:07:35] change and transform our minds and our
[1:07:39] thinking this glory of the Lord is
[1:07:42] powerful can you say amen amen when I
[1:07:44] was speaking to the couples today I was
[1:07:46] bringing some of the pressures of life
[1:07:48] and everyday
[1:07:49] responsibilities and I was bringing a
[1:07:51] point to the couples and the families
[1:07:53] that there's something about the
[1:07:54] pressures of this life that Jesus spoke
[1:07:56] of particularly in time pressures when
[1:07:59] there be perplexity and fear upon men's
[1:08:01] hearts and scare of war and all these
[1:08:04] things Jesus mentioned for our age and
[1:08:06] then he said there'll be betrayal
[1:08:08] there'll be prophets and deceivers and
[1:08:10] so Jesus told about it and he said many
[1:08:12] shall betray one another and and and
[1:08:15] then he talks about false prophets so
[1:08:17] you know all those scriptures so I I
[1:08:18] brought those up but my point was in
[1:08:21] talking about everyday responsibilities
[1:08:23] of marriage and family and and also the
[1:08:26] pressure of Jesus talking about in this
[1:08:28] age all of that is a pressure on all of
[1:08:31] us as well but what it is to do is to
[1:08:34] cause us to disconnect to disconnect us
[1:08:38] from our relationship with the Lord to
[1:08:41] put us under pressure that we disconnect
[1:08:44] from the most important thing and that
[1:08:46] is relationship with the Lord and
[1:08:48] relationship in our demestic life it's
[1:08:50] to disconnect couples it's to disconnect
[1:08:53] the the family of God dis connect the
[1:08:56] church that every Everybody kind of
[1:08:58] lives in their own world no the body of
[1:09:01] Christ is to come together in
[1:09:03] forgiveness in love and to come together
[1:09:05] but you see everything that the devil
[1:09:07] has is to disconnect us from the most
[1:09:10] important thing and that's relationship
[1:09:12] from a deeper relationship and I
[1:09:14] mentioned the word estrangement which is
[1:09:16] a Biblical word you become asang to one
[1:09:19] another in your marriage you become
[1:09:20] asang to to to sometimes to God and that
[1:09:24] can occur over time the amaz the amazing
[1:09:27] thing though is the heart can
[1:09:30] disconnect uh and someone can still be
[1:09:34] attending church now I've been a pastor
[1:09:36] for a little while short time 35 years
[1:09:38] 36 years now and I watch sometimes
[1:09:41] people can be still coming to church but
[1:09:43] their heart is
[1:09:45] disconnected their wall is
[1:09:47] up and it could be a number of reasons
[1:09:50] and so you just pray and you say Lord
[1:09:52] give me the word for them if they come
[1:09:54] for counsel trying to help them and just
[1:09:57] you know encourage them along but you
[1:09:58] see now PE I realize people can come and
[1:10:01] the mind and the Heart can get so
[1:10:04] disconnected even while people are
[1:10:06] attending church we've just experienced
[1:10:07] a real Cha tragic event in our uh family
[1:10:10] my wife's U brother-in-law my
[1:10:12] brother-in-law uh he just a few weeks
[1:10:14] ago committed suicide and it's just such
[1:10:17] a tragic thing for our family and we're
[1:10:19] still supporting his wife and just
[1:10:21] trying to be a support to them but it
[1:10:24] was a real uh rough thing to go through
[1:10:26] and I think what made it more rough is
[1:10:29] this this brother my brother-in-law he
[1:10:31] was not an unbeliever he was a
[1:10:33] Believer and that's a difficult thing to
[1:10:36] process to see someone that comes into
[1:10:39] that and I was very honest with you do
[1:10:41] today to mention to you that sometimes
[1:10:43] even in my own church you have people
[1:10:45] that is having mental things to go take
[1:10:48] place and so you're trying to help that
[1:10:50] you may say well I don't know why that's
[1:10:52] going on but you see sometimes the
[1:10:54] devil's attacking especially Believers
[1:10:57] and they get in a mental state we've
[1:10:58] been dealing with a little bit of that
[1:10:59] at home but you see now this was really
[1:11:01] rough to see and it it it it it made
[1:11:04] it's made me really pray and think about
[1:11:06] Lord what kind of time are we living in
[1:11:08] because when you see a brother that's
[1:11:10] actually attending church and a very
[1:11:12] good church I won't mention the church
[1:11:14] and I haven't mentioned his name or
[1:11:16] anything some of you know him but he he
[1:11:18] was it seemed like a good brother no one
[1:11:20] would ever dreamed that he would ever
[1:11:22] turn take a shotgun and turn it against
[1:11:25] his chest and blow himself up uh right
[1:11:27] in his own house nobody would ever
[1:11:29] thought of that nobody's seen it coming
[1:11:32] and so it's a mystery it's a hard thing
[1:11:34] to process when someone is attending and
[1:11:38] hearing the word and yet Satan is taking
[1:11:41] his heart and his mind so far distant
[1:11:44] and so far away from being disconnected
[1:11:47] and I only say it as a warning we need
[1:11:49] to be on our toes we need to stay prayed
[1:11:52] up we need to say Lord don't let me
[1:11:54] become disconnected Ed in my heart you
[1:11:57] know Jesus spoke of the Pharisees he
[1:11:58] said there are people who honor me with
[1:12:00] their lips but their heart is far from
[1:12:03] me that's right we might have way too
[1:12:06] many people that you can't tell where
[1:12:08] their hearts are but God wants to Ser us
[1:12:10] to serve him with all of our heart soul
[1:12:15] mind
[1:12:17] strength he wants us to love him with
[1:12:19] not just our heart and our soul but our
[1:12:21] all of ourselves and our mind is
[1:12:24] included that we have to submit our
[1:12:27] minds every day or Satan will overtake
[1:12:29] this battle on our minds and he will uh
[1:12:32] try try his best to get someone to to
[1:12:36] wander away and nobody recognizes that
[1:12:39] they're wandering away it's been a real
[1:12:41] uh heartache for our family but me
[1:12:43] personally just to consider to be more
[1:12:46] prayerful and the couple pastors that
[1:12:48] spoke at his funeral uh told me it's
[1:12:50] really made them examine themselves so
[1:12:53] that we can really be greatly used of
[1:12:55] the Lord so nobody sits in a
[1:12:58] congregation doesn't get
[1:13:02] help how Lord how can I help more how
[1:13:05] can I what Can I Do Lord because we
[1:13:07] don't want to see those things take
[1:13:09] place Hallelujah so but it's becoming
[1:13:13] detached and uh uh you know we live in a
[1:13:16] day that uh kind of it's kind of
[1:13:19] deceiving because there's I'm sure
[1:13:22] people have have been convinced that
[1:13:24] they are more connected than they have
[1:13:27] ever been with people through social
[1:13:30] media well connected I'm connected I'm
[1:13:34] connected with social media I you know
[1:13:36] I'm with I'm talking to my friends all
[1:13:38] the time I've got all kinds of friends
[1:13:40] I've got 20,000 friends you know andant
[1:13:43] I don't have social media my wife has a
[1:13:45] few of the things and she's got a lot of
[1:13:47] friends on there and uh quite a few
[1:13:50] friends and I always kind of tease her
[1:13:51] and say yeah but how many of them really
[1:13:53] know you you know and uh I just tease
[1:13:55] her a little bit but she's got a lot of
[1:13:57] friends on there I I don't like to be on
[1:13:59] there because I don't have time to
[1:14:00] answer back all all the things and I
[1:14:02] would feel bad about that but you know
[1:14:04] she has but but you see now the world is
[1:14:06] kind of cheap in Friendship the world is
[1:14:09] cheap in relationship and many people
[1:14:12] feel just uh connected but they're not
[1:14:15] really it's really deceiving to think
[1:14:17] that we are connected when we're by
[1:14:19] ourself but we're connected to the cyber
[1:14:22] world so we feel connected I think
[1:14:24] that's a big of
[1:14:25] deception none of it is face to
[1:14:28] face can you say Amen so that can teach
[1:14:32] us that be also because we are at church
[1:14:35] we are personally connected to Christ
[1:14:37] that's not always the case because we
[1:14:39] have a Bible app on our phone we're
[1:14:42] connected with Christ that that you're
[1:14:44] connected with your friends on your
[1:14:45] phone from Camp that means you're
[1:14:47] connected that does not mean that you're
[1:14:50] connected to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:52] that's right you know we went went from
[1:14:56] uh face to face uh conversation to
[1:15:00] texting then we went to FaceTime then we
[1:15:03] went to chats and then we got it cut up
[1:15:06] more and now it's not a chat it's a
[1:15:11] Snapchat and in this world there's a
[1:15:14] attack on time for relationships and
[1:15:17] things are so quickly done and people
[1:15:20] won't sit and just spend time in
[1:15:23] relationships sometimes with the Lord
[1:15:25] and there may be no amens right now but
[1:15:27] I'm going to say it anyway these things
[1:15:29] you know can have a good side to them
[1:15:31] but they're teaching us that that's
[1:15:33] connection and I'm here to tell you that
[1:15:35] that's not necessarily the connection
[1:15:38] God wants for you God doesn't not want
[1:15:40] to Snapchat with you with just a moment
[1:15:43] little reel and you have a little prayer
[1:15:45] Lord I need a new job and you have a
[1:15:47] little prayer and that's enough God does
[1:15:50] not want to have a Snapchat with you God
[1:15:52] wants a relationship with you God wants
[1:15:55] you to spend time with him and we're
[1:15:57] being taught by our
[1:15:59] society that everything's quick and
[1:16:02] everything relationships are shallow
[1:16:04] because of how we're
[1:16:07] taught praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:16:09] so Glory you these things we have to as
[1:16:12] Believers this day we have to be aware
[1:16:14] of it we have to be looking at that
[1:16:16] especially the young people but they're
[1:16:18] connecting this people feeling they're
[1:16:20] incredibly connected to the World on
[1:16:22] their phone but yet the same people are
[1:16:24] saying they're more lonely than they've
[1:16:26] ever been that's interesting in their
[1:16:28] world that they live in they're lonely
[1:16:29] and even depression has come from it and
[1:16:32] yet they say they're more connected
[1:16:33] online than they've ever been and yet
[1:16:35] they're more
[1:16:37] lonely that's when Satan deceives us
[1:16:40] that's right Christ is not wanting a
[1:16:43] Snapchat with us can you say Amen just a
[1:16:46] quick
[1:16:47] prayer
[1:16:49] amen so now when we look at the third
[1:16:51] pole Ministry we realize that it's it's
[1:16:54] something that God has sent to us uh and
[1:16:57] it's a it's a deeper Ministry it's not
[1:17:00] just it wasn't just for the prophet but
[1:17:02] it's for the bride as well and we know
[1:17:04] it's the opening of the word word we
[1:17:06] have known that but it's the opening of
[1:17:08] something even more than just the word
[1:17:10] when he opens the word and becomes open
[1:17:12] face before us then we begin to look in
[1:17:15] that it's not just books and tapes but
[1:17:17] it's actually looking into the full face
[1:17:20] of Christ without any veils he's taken
[1:17:23] all the veils off of his word he's taken
[1:17:26] all the veils off of himself so we can
[1:17:29] finally look into his face and what
[1:17:32] happens when we do that is we are
[1:17:33] changed from glory to glory it changes
[1:17:37] us and if it's not changing us then
[1:17:39] we're not fully looking into his face
[1:17:41] it's real simple if you're not being
[1:17:43] changed from glory to glory then
[1:17:45] something's wrong with how you're
[1:17:46] looking at him there's still a veil up
[1:17:49] there's still something in your mind
[1:17:51] between you and seeing it right because
[1:17:54] you don't have to work this up with the
[1:17:55] music you don't have to work it up
[1:17:57] necessarily with a prayer line that he's
[1:17:59] given us his word it's not just the
[1:18:01] Bible but it's his word the glory of God
[1:18:04] coming to this generation the person of
[1:18:07] Christ revealed to us this is what we
[1:18:10] have this is what we're blessed with
[1:18:13] this message is not a man it's the
[1:18:15] revealing of Jesus Christ this message
[1:18:18] is not about William brandom it's about
[1:18:21] a messenger coming to reveal Christ to
[1:18:23] us to see him in all of his glory
[1:18:26] finally after Seven Ages we can look at
[1:18:29] him the way that we need to see
[1:18:31] him this message is the greatest
[1:18:33] revealing of Christ that's ever hit
[1:18:36] planet
[1:18:37] Earth it is the greatest thing that's
[1:18:39] ever hit planet Earth and you hold it in
[1:18:42] your hands let's not miss what it's
[1:18:45] supposed to do in US yes let's not get
[1:18:49] online and watch all that's going on in
[1:18:51] the message get your eyes off of what's
[1:18:54] going on in the movement of the message
[1:18:56] get your eyes on Jesus Christ be changed
[1:18:59] by this
[1:19:01] word the third poll isn't big numbers
[1:19:03] the third poll isn't big meetings can
[1:19:06] you say amen I don't need to preach your
[1:19:08] pastor preaches it it came from that big
[1:19:10] tit in the vision it kept getting
[1:19:12] smaller until it was in a little room he
[1:19:14] said I'll meet you in there this third
[1:19:16] pole doesn't need big crowds this per
[1:19:19] third pole doesn't mean it's at just at
[1:19:21] the
[1:19:22] conventions do you know the five manif
[1:19:24] festations of the third pole weren't
[1:19:26] even in
[1:19:28] church none of them were in church one
[1:19:32] of them was on the
[1:19:33] phone God showing us that he can even
[1:19:37] bring greater glory in simple things and
[1:19:40] brother bradam says when I was in hady
[1:19:42] Wright's house he said I've been around
[1:19:44] the world I've been in some of the
[1:19:45] biggest prayer lines he said I watched
[1:19:48] the glory of God come down in that
[1:19:49] prayer line in South Africa he said I'll
[1:19:52] Never See God like this revealed again
[1:19:54] as far as his glory and he said but in
[1:19:56] that little house with that woman with
[1:19:58] no money whatsoever he said I felt the
[1:20:01] glory of God greater than I ever felt it
[1:20:05] in any meeting I've ever been
[1:20:07] in Praise the Lord
[1:20:10] hallelujah so you can imagine now it's
[1:20:12] just like when they built the second
[1:20:14] temple they restored it under Nehemiah
[1:20:16] and they begin to build it and hegi you
[1:20:19] can f find in hegi the prophet while
[1:20:21] he's there he says you that were in the
[1:20:22] first temple you're looking at this one
[1:20:24] and you're saying boy this is nothing
[1:20:26] compared to the first one so they're
[1:20:27] comparing the past and saying man this
[1:20:30] doesn't look like it and he bring he
[1:20:32] gave a prophecy he said the glory of
[1:20:34] this latter house will be greater than
[1:20:36] the glory in the first one it's prophecy
[1:20:39] the glory of this lad house this this
[1:20:43] one he's building which isn't a building
[1:20:46] it's his
[1:20:48] bride and the glory comes into his
[1:20:50] temples and this Glory will be greater
[1:20:54] but he said If you're looking at
[1:20:55] buildings and if you're looking How
[1:20:56] Majestic that Solomon's Temple was and
[1:20:59] you were there when the glory came down
[1:21:01] and people do that they go back to the
[1:21:02] past they say oh man we had some
[1:21:05] meetings back there doesn't seem like
[1:21:07] God is moving in and all you're looking
[1:21:09] to the past the prophecy is is the glory
[1:21:12] now will be greater than even in the
[1:21:15] days that William brandham was here
[1:21:18] that's right that's what the prophecy
[1:21:20] says I just want to be available to him
[1:21:24] I just just want to uh Lord help me to
[1:21:26] be humble before you let this thing work
[1:21:29] through me change me is anybody getting
[1:21:34] anything out of this tonight prise the
[1:21:36] Lord so now in talking about this uh
[1:21:40] Deuteronomy scripture now and we'll see
[1:21:42] how far we get tonight I don't want to
[1:21:43] be too long because we'll be back in the
[1:21:45] morning so we'll just go along here and
[1:21:47] then maybe pick it up in the morning see
[1:21:48] how the Lord leads but you see now under
[1:21:51] this third poll we see he uses Ordinary
[1:21:53] People that we would not expect for God
[1:21:56] to use and it's a deeper way of dealing
[1:21:59] with us than what he did before it's
[1:22:01] deeper than the first pole it's deeper
[1:22:03] than the second pole and the second pole
[1:22:05] was a discernment of Hearts it's deeper
[1:22:07] than that it's deeper than that it it's
[1:22:11] it's more secret than that but it's
[1:22:13] greater greater than the first and
[1:22:15] second poll he says it's a greater move
[1:22:18] of God it's something greater he didn't
[1:22:20] even know all what it
[1:22:22] was and uh it's it's I'm going to read
[1:22:25] something to you in a minute I'm getting
[1:22:26] ahead of my time but I I want you to
[1:22:28] notice something that the prophet said a
[1:22:29] couple times about that new ministry
[1:22:32] that he kept talking about so in the
[1:22:34] transition from Moses to Joshua um we
[1:22:38] realize that God begin to do things a
[1:22:39] little different and we had the Army we
[1:22:41] had Joshua bring him in the promised
[1:22:42] land and it's a type of the third pole
[1:22:45] coming into our promised land and yet
[1:22:47] the the first battle that comes along we
[1:22:49] find that uh uh Rahab was a harlot and
[1:22:54] so now and there was two brothers that
[1:22:56] went in there and witnessed to her told
[1:22:59] her about things and she had only heard
[1:23:01] of Moses she hadn't met Moses she hadn't
[1:23:04] been in the congregation she hadn't seen
[1:23:06] all the things she just heard about him
[1:23:08] and here now you have the mystery of
[1:23:10] this woman now not participating in any
[1:23:13] of the movement whatsoever she was not a
[1:23:16] part of any of it and yet and yet God
[1:23:19] gave her a word through these two these
[1:23:21] two men their names as far as I know are
[1:23:23] not in the Bible two uh unknown Brothers
[1:23:27] Two unknown Brothers we don't know their
[1:23:29] names two no
[1:23:32] names you know sometimes we get all
[1:23:34] about the names and the big names and
[1:23:36] who's the bigname preachers I can tell
[1:23:38] you under the third poll we lose all the
[1:23:41] big names we lose all the Big B big
[1:23:44] thing and two non-named brothers
[1:23:47] introduce the word to a harlot and and
[1:23:50] she spoke the word and God honored it
[1:23:54] right that's right she took the third
[1:23:58] pole she wasn't in the movement she
[1:24:01] wasn't a part of anything but she spoke
[1:24:04] the word said let it I I want to give me
[1:24:06] a token for my family and they said all
[1:24:09] right we'll give it to you put this do
[1:24:11] this and you will be in and her and her
[1:24:13] household as Jericho walls fell down she
[1:24:16] was saved by the word listen now she
[1:24:20] hadn't read she didn't have a Bible she
[1:24:22] didn't know what to say or what to ask
[1:24:25] for but God inspired her
[1:24:29] heart God inspired a harot coming to the
[1:24:33] Lord and she was given permission to use
[1:24:37] the spoken word right right wait a
[1:24:41] minute wait a minute she's got to come
[1:24:42] through some lessons first she hasn't
[1:24:45] read enough books of this message
[1:24:48] yet don't be surprised how much God
[1:24:51] surprises you that's right you got to
[1:24:54] all you got all the books and tapes in
[1:24:56] your home and you've been in the message
[1:24:57] for 50 something years well praise the
[1:24:59] Lord God bless you amen but don't you
[1:25:02] ever underestimate God dealing with
[1:25:05] people we've baptized people that
[1:25:07] they're most lately that's the most
[1:25:09] unlikely people that you would expect
[1:25:12] and I'm saying praise be to God may he
[1:25:15] fill even this church with the
[1:25:17] unexpected harlots with the unexpected
[1:25:21] [Applause]
[1:25:23] people there's there's no senority
[1:25:25] senority in this message that you get a
[1:25:27] you get a uh you get a ticket to the
[1:25:29] third pole because you've been in it for
[1:25:31] 50 years scripture proves that's not not
[1:25:35] true but she wasn't a part of all she
[1:25:39] did did not know Moses but she spoke the
[1:25:42] desire of her heart and God honored it
[1:25:43] and God gave it to her and so now that
[1:25:46] was I wanted to make a point that was a
[1:25:48] personal God changing a person
[1:25:50] personally this is a personal thing the
[1:25:53] third poll was more person Al and how
[1:25:55] much more personal can you get there's
[1:25:57] Moses message there's the great Army of
[1:25:59] Joshua that's where God was working
[1:26:02] right he was working in the army of
[1:26:03] Joshua well of course he was but see no
[1:26:05] inside Jericho that was fitted for
[1:26:08] Destruction and judgment there was a no
[1:26:10] name and she believed the message and
[1:26:12] spoke the word the spoken word on the
[1:26:14] lips of the believer is the third pole
[1:26:17] yeah it's the word coming down into the
[1:26:21] heart and the mouth and that's why
[1:26:23] Deuter says this word is not far from
[1:26:25] you it's here it needs to be in your
[1:26:28] heart it's needs to be n you it needs to
[1:26:31] be in your
[1:26:33] mouth that's where it's intended to be
[1:26:35] praise the Lord amen hallelujah praise
[1:26:38] the lord it's personal it's an personal
[1:26:41] experience it's not that you're a part
[1:26:43] of a church or a movement Rahab was not
[1:26:46] a part of the movement that's right but
[1:26:48] the glory of the Lord moved in
[1:26:50] her Hallelujah so just going to look a
[1:26:53] minute back at Moses message now and I
[1:26:57] want you to to notice just summarize it
[1:26:59] in two major parts because that types
[1:27:01] the message of today a cloud appeared in
[1:27:04] the
[1:27:05] mountain and that meant God was bringing
[1:27:08] his word to the people and we have seen
[1:27:11] that again in this hour even in a
[1:27:13] greater way the cloud appeared in the
[1:27:16] sky and the cloud was God bringing his
[1:27:19] word to the people the glory of God was
[1:27:21] in that Moses face sh uh was changed
[1:27:26] that was the change there in that
[1:27:28] ministry as far as Moses was concerned
[1:27:31] and then people would have the word
[1:27:33] because God brought the word that was
[1:27:35] the first part of it is the cloud or the
[1:27:37] god bringing the word to the people but
[1:27:39] the second thing is that if the people's
[1:27:41] hearts were not changed then that word
[1:27:44] would do them no good yeah yeah seeing
[1:27:47] the cloud would do them no good that's
[1:27:51] right watching the glory of God in Moses
[1:27:54] would really do them no
[1:27:57] good don't get quiet on me just gazing
[1:28:01] upon the cloud or just having a picture
[1:28:04] of the cloud in your home didn't
[1:28:07] necessarily mean that that Glory was
[1:28:09] changing the hearts of the people that's
[1:28:12] right I hope I don't offend you but I
[1:28:14] just want to speak it it was true then
[1:28:17] because we have evidence after evidence
[1:28:19] in the wilderness that even after the
[1:28:22] cloud came down and they actually said I
[1:28:24] won't read the scriptures here but
[1:28:26] they're the ones that said let Moses
[1:28:28] speak from nowan they're the ones that
[1:28:29] chose Prophets The People chose it don't
[1:28:33] let God speak Moses you speak and let it
[1:28:35] be prophets they chose that if you're
[1:28:38] witnessing to somebody you can tell them
[1:28:39] hey it was the people that chose a
[1:28:40] prophet not
[1:28:42] us amen and so here you have God coming
[1:28:46] down but you see now they said let the
[1:28:48] prophet speak but you know then we have
[1:28:51] another 40 years or what 30 years of the
[1:28:54] people proving sometimes they wanted to
[1:28:56] go back to Egypt sometimes their heart
[1:28:59] was still in Egypt sometimes they
[1:29:01] murmured complain I don't have time to
[1:29:03] talk about the history of the message in
[1:29:05] 40 years in the wilderness but it's not
[1:29:07] pleasant the people were childish little
[1:29:12] children that would not grow into Sons
[1:29:14] and Daughters of God nitpicking
[1:29:18] everything and it's because this Glory
[1:29:21] had not come closer to them
[1:29:24] they only seen the glory in Moses they
[1:29:26] only seen the glory in the cloud they
[1:29:27] only seen what happened as far as it
[1:29:30] visible he's still with me watching the
[1:29:33] glory of God and Moses did them no good
[1:29:35] having a picture of the cloud you do you
[1:29:37] know good why their hearts were not
[1:29:38] connected to his glory and the glory
[1:29:41] needed to come and change them
[1:29:43] personally can you say Amen am amen so
[1:29:46] now uh the people said you go up Moses
[1:29:48] and we'll hear but um if you get your
[1:29:50] Bibles and turn with me quick I I didn't
[1:29:52] want to leave this one out in Exodus 31
[1:29:54] we see something said here that is
[1:29:56] related to our subject Exodus
[1:30:01] 31 he says here in 31 verse 18 31:1 18
[1:30:07] He says uh and he gave Mo unto Moses
[1:30:10] when he had an end of the communion with
[1:30:12] upon Mount Si two tables of testimony
[1:30:15] tables of stone written with the Finger
[1:30:17] of God and then in chapter 32 verse one
[1:30:21] and when the people saw that Moses
[1:30:23] delayed to come down out of the mountain
[1:30:24] the people gathered themselves together
[1:30:26] unto Aaron said unto him let us make
[1:30:28] Gods which shall be for us as for this
[1:30:31] as for this Moses the man that brought
[1:30:33] us up out of the land of Egypt we what
[1:30:35] not what has become of him and then they
[1:30:37] got their Golden Earrings and they got
[1:30:38] all this they built a a molten calf you
[1:30:41] know that in the history probably
[1:30:42] learned that in Sunday school but you go
[1:30:45] all the way down here to what they're
[1:30:46] doing and then God comes down and sees
[1:30:48] it and you see what he says here in
[1:30:50] verse starting in verse 11 again Moses
[1:30:52] besought the Lord his God and said Lord
[1:30:54] why do thy wrath Wax Hot against thy
[1:30:56] people which thou Hast brought forth out
[1:30:58] of the land of Egypt which great power
[1:30:59] and with Mighty hand wherefore should
[1:31:01] the Egyptians speak and say for Mischief
[1:31:04] did he bring them out to slave in the in
[1:31:07] the mountains and to consume them so
[1:31:09] here I was going to speak tonight on
[1:31:11] conditions that need a God rich in Mercy
[1:31:13] this is God rich in Mercy giving Mercy
[1:31:17] to the people instead of destroying them
[1:31:19] Moses standing in the Gap go this is
[1:31:21] your people this is who you called look
[1:31:23] what the world is going to say about you
[1:31:26] and Christ is standing there and Moses
[1:31:28] saying Lord we we need to give Grace can
[1:31:31] you say Amen we we we need to and the
[1:31:34] Lord repented verse 14 of the evil which
[1:31:36] he thought to do un his people so this
[1:31:38] glorious event of the cloud and the word
[1:31:40] coming was a big change but the people
[1:31:43] were not changed the message was not
[1:31:45] done with the word coming in the cloud
[1:31:47] Christ coming in the cloud that wasn't
[1:31:50] the end of the message after the cloud
[1:31:52] came the word it was just the beginning
[1:31:56] of the real work in the people that's
[1:31:59] right that's why we've been 60 70
[1:32:02] years it was just the
[1:32:05] beginning
[1:32:06] so and then God says something else here
[1:32:09] in Deuteronomy 5:29 he says God says yes
[1:32:13] and the people said we'll we'll do it
[1:32:14] we'll do it they said bring the word
[1:32:16] we'll do it we'll do it and God says
[1:32:18] yeah that's that's fine that's a
[1:32:20] wonderful scenario but you see it has to
[1:32:23] be in the heart it has to be something
[1:32:26] that's more than just believing it in
[1:32:29] the
[1:32:31] prophet the truth is the children of
[1:32:33] Israel I'm sure were sincere in their
[1:32:34] early years it seemed like they beli but
[1:32:37] it takes time to get the glory that's in
[1:32:40] the word into the people's hearts we saw
[1:32:44] a Little Light Of Hope when they went
[1:32:47] over to the other when they were sent
[1:32:49] spies yeah and uh they come back with a
[1:32:52] bad report and there was a you know God
[1:32:55] was listening to their complaining we
[1:32:57] can't do it we can't do it and God was
[1:32:59] looking for a response out of the hearts
[1:33:01] of the
[1:33:02] people he had
[1:33:04] Moses he had Joshua right but he's
[1:33:07] looking for the people's attitude to
[1:33:10] change towards this world this
[1:33:14] glory is more than just watching it in
[1:33:17] Moses this glory is more than watching
[1:33:19] it just in brother
[1:33:21] one this glory is just watching it more
[1:33:23] on the ministers on online this glory is
[1:33:26] to come and change you
[1:33:28] yes he's looking for a response and I'm
[1:33:30] sure God was just sitting down just very
[1:33:32] discouraged after he heard them say we
[1:33:35] can't do it we can't do it there's
[1:33:36] Giants and all this other stuff and
[1:33:38] everybody was depressed the people were
[1:33:40] crying we can't do it we've come all
[1:33:42] this way and we can't do it and Joshua
[1:33:44] came wrote up and said shut shut shut up
[1:33:46] everybody we're well able to take the
[1:33:48] land this is God's
[1:33:50] promise and the God that was just had
[1:33:53] his head bowed and discouraged perked up
[1:33:56] his
[1:33:57] attention when Joshua and Caleb said
[1:34:00] that it perked up God's attention
[1:34:02] because why that's what he's wanting to
[1:34:04] hear from his
[1:34:07] people he's got Moses he's brought the
[1:34:09] word he's done all the stuff but he's
[1:34:11] looking for the people to change their
[1:34:14] hearts towards this
[1:34:16] word we're well able to take it I don't
[1:34:19] care how many enemies there we're not
[1:34:21] grasshoppers we're sons and daughter
[1:34:23] Daughters of
[1:34:25] God blessed be his
[1:34:27] name praise the Lord so now let's move
[1:34:30] ahead to our day and let's move ahead in
[1:34:31] a lot of ways because I'm going to be
[1:34:33] too long here tonight let's move ahead
[1:34:34] you moving ahead with me yeah all right
[1:34:36] praise the Lord so now in 19 uh 63 when
[1:34:41] brother brandham is speaking in a living
[1:34:42] room to some teenagers that are getting
[1:34:44] ready to graduate he he he says let me
[1:34:47] speak to the adults here just a moment
[1:34:49] and he goes into talking about the cloud
[1:34:51] and I won't read it all but he said
[1:34:52] Northeast of Flagstaff and Prescott 26
[1:34:55] mil High you all know this history he's
[1:34:58] referring to now he's going to refer to
[1:35:00] two things in this as he's talking to
[1:35:02] the parents he said he talks about the
[1:35:05] cloud uh planes fly at 19,000 un know
[1:35:08] feet and he's talking about this Cloud
[1:35:09] that was identified in Life Magazine God
[1:35:13] visiting us again and he said there's
[1:35:15] been so many things just coming down the
[1:35:18] road the other day and he knew that the
[1:35:22] seals coming was the change of his
[1:35:24] ministry he referred to it as this new
[1:35:27] ministry or the change in his ministry
[1:35:30] and he says that many times since he got
[1:35:32] those Visions about the third Bowl I'm
[1:35:34] looking for the change in my
[1:35:36] Ministry but but for the most part he
[1:35:38] didn't know what it was because the
[1:35:41] details God did not even share with
[1:35:45] him no the details of how it would play
[1:35:48] out he because even at the end he's
[1:35:50] saying well maybe this prayer line is it
[1:35:53] he one service he said maybe in this
[1:35:55] little room in the Tabernacle and I'll
[1:35:56] send my wife through there and he he
[1:35:59] still he he's under expectation what is
[1:36:02] this Vision what is this tent Vision
[1:36:04] yeah so and I'm not belittling because
[1:36:07] God may have shown but I know he didn't
[1:36:08] speak it but but because of his hints
[1:36:11] maybe it's this and maybe it's that and
[1:36:13] then when he got after 6 he says it's
[1:36:15] here but he didn't know details how it
[1:36:17] was going to play out completely and so
[1:36:20] he speaks to the adults and he says
[1:36:22] there's been so many things things and
[1:36:24] now watch what he says here he says
[1:36:26] coming down the road the other day there
[1:36:27] was something happened that was spoke to
[1:36:29] me uh that I must do and it's not my
[1:36:32] message he said Leo Mercer said brother
[1:36:34] brandham the time will come after this
[1:36:37] said about five or six years ago maybe
[1:36:40] seven that's when he first started
[1:36:42] before 1963 five or six years is when he
[1:36:44] got the Visions we're all believers here
[1:36:47] tonight so this is okay to talk about
[1:36:48] right five or six years he got those
[1:36:50] visions of the tent vision and the third
[1:36:52] pole but he didn't know what was and now
[1:36:54] he's talking here coming down the road
[1:36:56] and brother Leo Mercer he says he says
[1:36:59] brother brandom he says this is he said
[1:37:02] brother Brown the time will come after
[1:37:04] this about five or six years ago maybe
[1:37:06] seven said the Lord's going to change
[1:37:08] your ministry brother Bram and said when
[1:37:10] he does you'll probably just line up
[1:37:12] hospitals and speak them out of the beds
[1:37:15] and
[1:37:15] things and it didn't sound right to me
[1:37:18] although I believe brother Leah was
[1:37:20] trying to be sincere about it because
[1:37:22] you see you look at the first second
[1:37:23] poll and you realize it's got to be
[1:37:25] something greater so okay he'll go empty
[1:37:28] the hospitals and that's man's
[1:37:30] interpretation don't interpret what
[1:37:32] God's going to do with his glory because
[1:37:34] it might be much more simple we know
[1:37:38] it's not a public show so opening
[1:37:40] hospitals and emptying them now that's a
[1:37:42] public show that's going to be on
[1:37:45] CNN we know this third poll is not a
[1:37:48] public show but we also know it's a
[1:37:51] greater glory
[1:37:53] than has ever been
[1:37:55] before praise the Lord praise God I'm
[1:37:58] having a good time tonight I could shout
[1:38:00] the aisles because why I feel like that
[1:38:03] I'm a part of this by his grace but he
[1:38:05] says to brother Leo he says that didn't
[1:38:07] seem right to me he said and brother Le
[1:38:10] was trying to be sincere but it didn't
[1:38:11] sound just right because see our lord
[1:38:13] Jesus never did that he went in he went
[1:38:15] to the hospitals there was one in the
[1:38:18] hospital do you remember where it was in
[1:38:19] the Bible the pool of Bethesda great
[1:38:21] multitudes of impotent people there
[1:38:23] crippled lame blind withered waiting for
[1:38:25] the angel now that was a spiritual
[1:38:27] hospital where people waited on Divine
[1:38:29] Healing and here the Divine healer
[1:38:31] himself came in and healed one and
[1:38:34] walked out so you could expect a mortal
[1:38:37] man or a Ministry to come forth that
[1:38:39] would be greater than that was wow see I
[1:38:41] couldn't agree with it but as I started
[1:38:44] to turn around the Holy Spirit come upon
[1:38:47] me I asked Leo for a pen I got a piece
[1:38:50] of paper and I wrote it it's in his
[1:38:52] trailer today if you ever want to go up
[1:38:54] there it's in that old aluminum trailer
[1:38:56] where I had on the Shelf just as you go
[1:38:58] in the door on the shelf on the right
[1:38:59] side right in the right front of the
[1:39:00] trailer it's laying under there I laid
[1:39:02] it up there and said it said on the
[1:39:05] someday you can pull this
[1:39:07] out God will never change the ministry
[1:39:13] but he will change the man with the
[1:39:17] ministry that's right that's right now
[1:39:20] he only says that two places in the
[1:39:22] entire message all the other times he
[1:39:25] refers to the new ministry the change in
[1:39:28] my Ministry the new ministry which is
[1:39:30] fine because the the vision said it's
[1:39:32] going to be a new ministry but you see
[1:39:34] now when he got closer to what it really
[1:39:36] was it wasn't a change in the ministry
[1:39:40] it was a change in
[1:39:42] him oh my good
[1:39:47] Hallelujah we got to look at these
[1:39:49] things friends thank you Jesus so you
[1:39:52] might ask so what is it that God was
[1:39:55] trying to change in the prophet well he
[1:39:56] was honest about it when he mentioned
[1:39:58] this the first time he said I'm too much
[1:40:00] of a weakling he said I let other people
[1:40:03] tell me what to do or he said I even
[1:40:06] wait for God to bring a thus sayith the
[1:40:08] Lord and you'll find in why Christ speak
[1:40:11] he's teaching Sons adoption that the
[1:40:14] words here you're equipped you already
[1:40:17] have it why are you crying unto me speak
[1:40:20] and go
[1:40:21] forward speak and go forward you already
[1:40:25] have the word put it upon your Li lips
[1:40:27] and go
[1:40:30] forward amen I was on this Wednesday
[1:40:33] night at my church Bo we had a Shou in
[1:40:34] time God wants to see this word upon
[1:40:37] your lips not just on your heart but
[1:40:39] it's when you speak it he says it's a
[1:40:41] thought until you speak it then it
[1:40:43] becomes
[1:40:46] creation help us Lord and so so he says
[1:40:50] it it'll be God will never change the
[1:40:51] ministry but he will change me so saying
[1:40:53] the first time he said I'm a bit of a
[1:40:55] weakling can you imagine the prophet
[1:40:56] saying he's weakling I don't view him as
[1:40:57] a weakling at all but when God starts to
[1:41:00] reveal weaknesses in us the prophet was
[1:41:02] honest about it he said I'm I'm a
[1:41:05] weakling in a certain area that I don't
[1:41:07] step out sometimes like I should I would
[1:41:10] never dream that of brother Brandon but
[1:41:11] let me say something about that only God
[1:41:13] knows our weaknesses better than anybody
[1:41:15] else you think your wife knows them
[1:41:17] pretty good but God knows them even
[1:41:20] better than your wife you see
[1:41:23] and so God knows how he needs to change
[1:41:27] the man in order to meet the
[1:41:30] ministry so he said I'm a weakling and
[1:41:33] God's got to strengthen me in the area
[1:41:34] the other one was very he talked about
[1:41:37] it a lot and that
[1:41:39] was before the seals he got a
[1:41:43] complex he said i' I've blasted out at
[1:41:46] these retas and these rickes and I go
[1:41:49] back every year they get worse and worse
[1:41:51] and he lost the feeling for the people
[1:41:53] he said he was considering leaving the
[1:41:55] ministry because I'm doing this it's not
[1:41:58] helping all this was internally going on
[1:42:01] he was keeping it secret even from his
[1:42:02] wife I'm going to sneak her away I'm
[1:42:04] going to go up North I'm going to be a
[1:42:06] Trapper God wants me to say something to
[1:42:07] people I'll be be like the Old Testament
[1:42:09] prophet and just come out and blast it
[1:42:10] go back to my trapping he's planning all
[1:42:12] this and you know the story he's he's
[1:42:14] doing it based upon not the will of God
[1:42:16] on a complex amen he's backing off he's
[1:42:20] you know people listen uh pastors and
[1:42:22] all of us sometimes we go through things
[1:42:26] and we begin giving up on the inside a
[1:42:28] little bit not verbally not to the
[1:42:31] church we're still shouting and praising
[1:42:33] the Lord but sometimes things we can go
[1:42:35] through we just give it up I can tell
[1:42:36] you that's what happened with brother
[1:42:37] Brown I'm going to leave the
[1:42:39] ministry and when God began to recognize
[1:42:41] it he used it as a thing to enhance and
[1:42:46] to bring him more to a mature Son of God
[1:42:51] and deal with that complex and if you
[1:42:53] want to get the sermon where he
[1:42:55] elaborates fully it's called standing in
[1:42:57] the Gap he was going through this while
[1:42:59] he's at the climax of his ministry to
[1:43:01] preach the seals in his heart he's
[1:43:04] considering leaving the ministry while
[1:43:07] he's preaching the seals near as I can
[1:43:09] you can correct me if I'm wrong but near
[1:43:11] as I can see it because it wasn't till
[1:43:13] after that that God dealt with him and
[1:43:15] then we see standing in the app he's
[1:43:16] open before the people this is he says
[1:43:19] God had to come and correct me for my
[1:43:21] complex and he said I didn't have enough
[1:43:24] love for the people I lost my feeling
[1:43:27] for the
[1:43:29] people now we understand why he said I
[1:43:33] have to change the man it's not a change
[1:43:36] of your ministry it's a change of
[1:43:39] you so that I can love people
[1:43:44] deeper I'll join in with that I need to
[1:43:46] love people deeper than what I do I know
[1:43:48] I love people but I need to love them
[1:43:50] deeper I need the mercies of God
[1:43:53] on my lips upon my heart this is a day
[1:43:56] that has conditions that we need a God
[1:43:57] who's rich in Mercy can I get an
[1:44:01] amen in these conditions we need a God
[1:44:03] rich in Mercy rich in Grace because the
[1:44:07] conditions are too difficult to meet
[1:44:09] with psychology or any kind of thing
[1:44:11] like that it takes the grace of God
[1:44:13] stepping in supernaturally to situations
[1:44:16] when people are suicidal when people are
[1:44:18] mental when there's depression trying to
[1:44:19] strike the church and strike the minds
[1:44:22] we need something more than In A Book
[1:44:23] and Tape we need the supernatural God to
[1:44:26] do something it might be simple but he
[1:44:27] needs to help that person help him to
[1:44:30] get a sound mind because the Bible says
[1:44:32] he wishes above all things that we'd
[1:44:34] prosper and be in health as our soul
[1:44:36] prospers and that he's G not given us
[1:44:39] the spirit of fear but power and love
[1:44:41] and a sound mind that's what he's
[1:44:44] promised and the people need it can you
[1:44:46] say
[1:44:47] amen he said it's not to change the
[1:44:50] ministry but change the man with the
[1:44:51] ministry that's what's to be done done
[1:44:53] and I know what I've got to do but I
[1:44:55] can't do it in the condition that I'm in
[1:44:56] now this 1963 I know what I got to do
[1:44:58] but I can't do it in the condition I'm
[1:45:00] in now because something has got to
[1:45:03] happen within me that will take God to
[1:45:07] do it may we take that as our prayer
[1:45:10] tonight something is got to change in US
[1:45:14] you may be perfect and got it all
[1:45:15] figured out God bless you I hope we can
[1:45:18] all reach where you're at someday but I
[1:45:20] want to have that prayer humbly before
[1:45:21] the prophet God
[1:45:23] change me God change me so I can meet
[1:45:27] the conditions of this time we need
[1:45:29] humility in our hearts we haven't
[1:45:32] arrived yet yes we need humility in our
[1:45:36] heart to say God change
[1:45:40] me Hallelujah there's a new song by The
[1:45:43] Kingdom ears I had a sister sing it last
[1:45:45] Sunday and it says I pray I pray until
[1:45:49] Heaven comes down I pray until something
[1:45:52] changes but he say said most of all I
[1:45:54] pray until God changes
[1:45:57] me we stay in prayer till God changes us
[1:46:01] we want we want to pray so he'll change
[1:46:02] situations change my wife change my
[1:46:05] husband change my children and that's
[1:46:07] all fine but we need to really pray that
[1:46:09] God would change
[1:46:11] us and keep praying until God changes
[1:46:16] us hallelujah I'm going to SK some
[1:46:18] things here now Hallelujah so we need to
[1:46:22] have the mindset of God you see now they
[1:46:25] had the mindset that God he says and
[1:46:28] Paul quotes This I Believe In First
[1:46:30] Corinthians as well he says God is
[1:46:33] present God is not a far off and they
[1:46:36] had the mindset that that that there's
[1:46:38] there's someone had to go to heaven and
[1:46:41] bring something back to us just want to
[1:46:43] dwell on that just a minute or someone's
[1:46:46] got to go across the sea and bring it
[1:46:48] back to us but you see now uh we we
[1:46:53] realize that it we have to lose that
[1:46:56] mindset um when we're looking for a
[1:46:58] change sometimes we're looking for God
[1:47:00] to send something greater to
[1:47:02] us we're under expectations for him to
[1:47:05] bring something down to us from heaven
[1:47:08] we have the mindset of God is bringing
[1:47:11] something to us but God's trying to say
[1:47:13] no the word is NY in thy mouth and in
[1:47:17] thy heart maybe we need to see it as God
[1:47:20] taking us deeper in of God bringing us
[1:47:26] something that's right yeah we can
[1:47:29] elaborate on it God we're always you
[1:47:31] know in in in our if we let the enemy
[1:47:34] beat us up we always think God's so far
[1:47:37] away from
[1:47:39] us we always put God way
[1:47:43] out and he's so far away God come closer
[1:47:46] to me God come closer he might be nearer
[1:47:48] to you than what you
[1:47:51] realize God is in inviting you he says
[1:47:54] that where I am ye may be
[1:47:57] also people he's so God's so far away
[1:48:00] from me God's so far away who who comes
[1:48:02] up with that who the the devil puts that
[1:48:05] in our mind I'm just way too far or I
[1:48:07] sin too far I made too many mistakes and
[1:48:10] God is way far away and we use the quote
[1:48:12] that said he just takes his flight for a
[1:48:14] little while and we understand that but
[1:48:15] you see now when it comes to the word
[1:48:18] that he's given us we've got to realize
[1:48:20] it's not God's got to go get something
[1:48:23] from heaven and bring it back he's
[1:48:25] already brought it it's already here
[1:48:29] it's already done can you say
[1:48:31] amen God needs to send something greater
[1:48:34] for me a greater experience and we're
[1:48:36] waiting for a greater experience with
[1:48:38] maybe God's waiting on
[1:48:40] us maybe all that we need is here
[1:48:43] already and sometimes our prayer needs
[1:48:45] to be God change
[1:48:46] me so now you know uh I think I'm just
[1:48:50] going to skip over this but just one
[1:48:52] note of I'm going to skip all of it I
[1:48:55] sometimes I study the prayer lines
[1:48:57] because you learn how God deals with
[1:48:59] people in the prayer lines and there's
[1:49:01] many things I've learned from those
[1:49:03] prayer lines of how God deals with
[1:49:04] people but the people that are in
[1:49:06] nervousness and depression um often you
[1:49:10] find I've got about six quotes here and
[1:49:12] brother BR says it over again something
[1:49:14] about somebody saying if I can just find
[1:49:17] a place to start if I can just and this
[1:49:19] is somebody that's real nervous anxiety
[1:49:23] panic attacks they just been through
[1:49:25] something um how many of you know that
[1:49:27] science is proving over and over again
[1:49:30] what the prophet said in those prayer
[1:49:32] lines and what he said through the
[1:49:33] message about the subconscious they're
[1:49:35] coming out with it more and more that's
[1:49:36] the truth about a human being a human
[1:49:39] being when they have a trauma especially
[1:49:42] when they're a child some huge trauma it
[1:49:44] could be abuse it could be anything but
[1:49:47] when they have a trauma hit their system
[1:49:49] that trauma hits them and it gets into
[1:49:51] our sens or or our cells of our body we
[1:49:55] think it gets in our memory so we can
[1:49:56] never forget it we get down through life
[1:49:58] we had bad memories of something
[1:49:59] somebody abused us somebody beat us
[1:50:02] somebody did some ver something like
[1:50:03] verbal abuse whatever it was as a child
[1:50:06] it hit you and we think it got in my
[1:50:09] memory I can it's hard for me to forget
[1:50:10] it but it doesn't Sciences proof it
[1:50:12] doesn't just get in your memory it gets
[1:50:15] actually in the cells of your
[1:50:18] system and it takes a picture of that
[1:50:21] and that's why you say can't forget it
[1:50:23] that picture in mine five years old 10
[1:50:25] years old you go back you keep going
[1:50:26] back and you lived out because your
[1:50:28] whole system took a picture of that
[1:50:30] trauma just dealt with a brother the
[1:50:32] other day and you know he didn't have a
[1:50:34] clue how the devil was using as a
[1:50:36] 10-year-old boy he wasn't loved he
[1:50:38] wasn't treated right and he he finally
[1:50:40] after all of his life shared it all with
[1:50:42] me and I said brother I said you weren't
[1:50:45] love God I don't I know how you survive
[1:50:47] that it's the grace of God you're here
[1:50:48] today but when I begin to say this is
[1:50:50] what the devil is doing now to dest
[1:50:52] destroy your Christian Life when it was
[1:50:55] all revealed he started to be free amen
[1:50:58] cuz the devil could no longer use it
[1:51:00] when it's been
[1:51:02] exposed but I took him through this to
[1:51:04] say science says it gets in your system
[1:51:07] then when it's a picture in yourselves
[1:51:10] then it goes to the next thing and
[1:51:11] that's a belief system you start to
[1:51:13] believe that that's you you weren't
[1:51:16] valued right that's your identity in
[1:51:18] life you believe into what it put you
[1:51:21] down and made you as and if you were
[1:51:23] abused I must not be worthy because I
[1:51:25] was abused and you believe that you
[1:51:27] start believing that only the grace of
[1:51:29] God would come and tell you you're not
[1:51:31] that when the when the woman at the well
[1:51:33] meet Jesus Christ within second she
[1:51:35] realized I'm not a harlot I'm not what
[1:51:37] my daddy told me I was I don't have to
[1:51:40] live this way
[1:51:43] hallelujah thank you Jesus so the next
[1:51:46] stages you begin to believe it and then
[1:51:48] after that you begin to believe it it
[1:51:50] affects your nervous system
[1:51:53] that's the next stage you become nervous
[1:51:55] about because you're believing it and
[1:51:56] it's that picture is there and a person
[1:52:00] becomes nervous their whole life brother
[1:52:01] bram's praying for people that been
[1:52:02] nervous their entire lives and then the
[1:52:05] next stage is many times many times
[1:52:08] about
[1:52:10] 93% of physical sicknesses come from the
[1:52:14] nervous
[1:52:15] system so now they're standing there
[1:52:18] with an ulcer they're standing there
[1:52:20] with somewhere and brother Bram says but
[1:52:22] this really didn't start here it started
[1:52:25] because you're
[1:52:26] nervous why are you
[1:52:28] nervous that's all you know now you know
[1:52:31] after all these years we didn't need
[1:52:33] science to prove this to
[1:52:35] us but we need we needed a superatural
[1:52:39] God and he can visit tonight Jesus he
[1:52:43] knows how to take care of trauma he
[1:52:45] knows how to change the picture he knows
[1:52:48] how to change the
[1:52:50] cells he's not just a Healer physically
[1:52:53] in healing lines he heals the mind he
[1:52:56] heals the cells he goes the source of
[1:52:58] the
[1:53:00] demon our atonement is not just to heal
[1:53:04] physical
[1:53:05] sickness sometimes I feel like calling a
[1:53:07] prayer line just for mental illness
[1:53:09] today because it's not just that we have
[1:53:11] physical sicknesses but mental illness
[1:53:14] healing is needed for everything and our
[1:53:16] atonement provides it sister Our God has
[1:53:20] provided in our atonement everything
[1:53:22] that we
[1:53:24] we don't need to go to man for
[1:53:26] that so I just skip that part but I just
[1:53:29] wanted to mention he says it over and
[1:53:31] again and what's need is they they say
[1:53:33] if I could just find a place to start
[1:53:35] this is what a a nervous if I could just
[1:53:37] find a place to start and brother Braham
[1:53:39] keeps saying to him you've found your
[1:53:41] place to
[1:53:43] start just if there's something about
[1:53:45] the enemy that's always putting
[1:53:47] something out there I can't reach God if
[1:53:50] I could just find a place to start
[1:53:53] uh I got a sister in my church and and
[1:53:54] she relates that because it's just like
[1:53:56] I want to get out of this I want to get
[1:53:58] out of this anxiety if I could just find
[1:54:00] a place to just to begin again brother
[1:54:04] Bri would say this is your place the
[1:54:06] Lord is here step right onto here's your
[1:54:09] place it's not out there someday it's
[1:54:11] right here the word is not a far off
[1:54:14] it's on your heart is upon your lips
[1:54:17] it's not way out there but it's nigh
[1:54:21] even in thy mouth
[1:54:23] even in the so friends tonight be
[1:54:24] encouraged in this simple way you may
[1:54:26] feel like God's a long ways away from
[1:54:28] you he's probably not as far as you're
[1:54:30] making them he's probably not as far as
[1:54:33] the devil's making them from your life
[1:54:36] praise be to God I trust this is a
[1:54:38] blessing to you tonight I am looking my
[1:54:40] best to find a place to end so we can
[1:54:42] pick it up maybe another time praise the
[1:54:45] Lord maybe in the morning oh God is good
[1:54:49] amen but the word is nigh thee in thy
[1:54:51] mouth in thy heart that thou mayest do
[1:54:54] it you'll fulfill it you'll walk in it
[1:54:57] when it's in your heart when it's in
[1:54:58] your mouth it's not a change in the
[1:55:00] ministry it's a change in us it's God
[1:55:03] renewing our minds that you be
[1:55:06] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:55:09] mind I think there's a lot of preaching
[1:55:11] sometimes today that makes us look for
[1:55:13] the next Revival or the next big
[1:55:15] preacher to come to get our deliverance
[1:55:17] maybe we're looking for a a re looking
[1:55:20] for Revival the wrong way it's not not
[1:55:22] necessarily at the next meeting or a far
[1:55:24] off or the next Camp right now this
[1:55:26] evening you can receive what you need
[1:55:29] it's a personal Revival it's not a
[1:55:30] Revival that we go to a meeting it's not
[1:55:32] a church Revival it's a personal Revival
[1:55:35] you can have your own Revival we're not
[1:55:37] looking for a national Revival or a
[1:55:39] church Revival or even it's if it's got

[1:56:02] listen the revivals in the past brother
[1:56:04] I'm talking about the Welch Revival and
[1:56:06] that policeman saying because somebody
[1:56:09] is saying where's the building where
[1:56:10] it's at we're always looking for the
[1:56:12] building which camp meeting is the best
[1:56:14] to attend in the message where can I
[1:56:17] we're always looking for it somewhere
[1:56:19] else and that policeman whistling
[1:56:22] they said they said in the Welch Revival
[1:56:25] that that that the jails emptied out
[1:56:27] people got saved the policemen were off
[1:56:30] duty because there was nobody no crime
[1:56:32] anymore God just poured upon that whole
[1:56:36] place and the policeman was whisten and
[1:56:38] said can you tell me where it's at and
[1:56:40] he says you're standing in the middle of
[1:56:42] the Welch Revival I am the Welch Revival
[1:56:46] I am the bride's Revival you're looking
[1:56:48] at
[1:56:50] it it's not at a conv ion it's not at a
[1:56:53] geographical
[1:56:55] Place blessed be his name you know what
[1:56:58] Revival is it's change Revival is the
[1:57:01] glory of the Lord changing people you
[1:57:03] can have a meeting but not have real
[1:57:05] change when there's real change and
[1:57:08] fruit to follow and it breaks the Cycles
[1:57:10] in US it stops US turning back to things
[1:57:13] it stops habits in our life it stops
[1:57:16] Cycles in our life it it it it's it
[1:57:19] stops these things that are the devil
[1:57:21] beating us up can sayen it's not you
[1:57:24] saying I've changed but it's just God
[1:57:27] changing us and testifying he's Chang me
[1:57:32] oh blessed be his name praise the Lord
[1:57:34] so much more that we could bring I'll
[1:57:37] just read one quote about the mind now
[1:57:39] Romans 12:2 be not conformed to this
[1:57:42] world but be you transformed by the
[1:57:45] renewing of your mind the changing of
[1:57:48] your mind that you may prove what is
[1:57:50] that good acceptable and perfect will of
[1:57:52] God power of transformation I'll close
[1:57:55] on this quote that's what we all want to
[1:57:57] do be not conformed to this world
[1:57:59] brother B quotes the same scripture but
[1:58:01] be you transformed by the renewing of
[1:58:03] the mind to do the perfect and
[1:58:04] acceptable will of God your pastors
[1:58:07] probably read this one before I love
[1:58:08] this now that you've been
[1:58:11] saved as we are and now that you've been
[1:58:14] filled with the Holy Spirit as we have
[1:58:18] now we want the mind that was in Christ
[1:58:22] to be in us that we might be transformed
[1:58:25] from the Natural Things of life and be
[1:58:28] brought in to do the will of God by
[1:58:32] transformation of God's spirit by his
[1:58:35] word I don't know about you but I read
[1:58:36] in there that he's not stopping after he
[1:58:39] gives us the Holy Ghost the change is
[1:58:41] not stopping just after the Holy Ghost
[1:58:44] because he's got to get in our thoughts
[1:58:45] my wife was reminding me of the quote
[1:58:47] today he says when God begins to come
[1:58:49] from the heart it moves up into your
[1:58:52] your lips you begin to speak it takes
[1:58:54] all the things you speak wrong away
[1:58:56] moves up into your eyes that you see the
[1:58:58] right things and finally it moves up
[1:59:00] into your mind that you're thinking like
[1:59:02] the mind of
[1:59:04] Christ Hallelujah this is a change not
[1:59:09] just in our souls but this is a complete
[1:59:12] change and particularly a change in our
[1:59:16] thinking even the things we brought up
[1:59:18] tonight thinking about re what Revival
[1:59:20] is thinking about how God brings us to
[1:59:22] it he's correcting our thinking because
[1:59:25] we can be stuck in a rut when we're
[1:59:26] thinking about God a certain way
[1:59:28] thinking about the glory of God thinking
[1:59:30] about the third pole and we only look at
[1:59:31] it through certain eyes we need we need
[1:59:33] to step back and say Lord just let me be
[1:59:36] available to do this work the way that
[1:59:40] you want to do it you're a young person
[1:59:42] here tonight you're not excluded from
[1:59:44] what I'm preaching this isn't preaching

[2:11:07] tonight when Paul said the the the you
[2:11:10] know RAB prophesied do you know she
[2:11:12] actually
[2:11:13] prophesied she told those men when you
[2:11:16] go down hide yourself three days
[2:11:22] is Jesus in the
[2:11:25] grave she said hide yourself three days
[2:11:29] she
[2:11:30] prophesied the
[2:11:33] resurrection she told them to for for
[2:11:36] them to hide
[2:11:38] himself you can see how the message of
[2:11:42] those messenger affected that
[2:11:45] woman if they never listen to her they
[2:11:47] will be
[2:11:49] killed if they will have disobey what
[2:11:52] she said they will be
[2:11:54] killed she told them those men are out
[2:11:57] to see you hire yourself 3 days after 3
[2:12:01] days you are
[2:12:04] safe on
[2:12:06] inspiration God affected her so much
[2:12:10] until she prophesied the
[2:12:16] resurrection
[2:12:17] hallelujah thank you you see how just
[2:12:20] just simple message can bring a
[2:12:25] glory praise the Lord you might be
[2:12:28] waiting for her to take out her earrings
[2:12:30] and her lips spith but something changed
[2:12:33] in her so much that God was pleased to
[2:12:37] give her a
[2:12:38] [Music]
[2:12:45] word if the people would just be engaged
[2:12:48] with the message that is preached if we
[2:12:51] will just be
