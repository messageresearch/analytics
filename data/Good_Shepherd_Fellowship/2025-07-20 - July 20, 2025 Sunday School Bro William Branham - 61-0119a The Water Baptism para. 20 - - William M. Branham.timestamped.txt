[3:33] I'm going to take in in my Bible and I'm
[3:36] going to
[3:41] mark it down or whatever more. You do as
[3:43] you want to and then I'm going to um I'm
[3:48] going to get you I want you then to um
[3:52] to uh after you do this, write it down.
[3:54] And then if there's any question, I want
[3:57] you to be sure and and um ask me now.
[4:03] Ask me. So if at any future time on this
[4:07] tape, if somebody would have to ask you
[4:10] a question, you might be able to come
[4:12] back and explain it. Now, in order to
[4:16] straighten these people out and to get
[4:20] these two uh uh down right, I'm I'm
[4:24] going to have to make to almost blend
[4:29] two subjects together.
[4:33] Now,
[4:34] uh in Matthew 28:19,
[4:37] now that's the last book of the Bible,
[4:40] the last book of Matthew, last part of
[4:41] Matthew.
[4:43] Now let's read the last verse 18th
[4:47] verse. And Jesus came and spake unto
[4:49] them saying, All power is given unto me
[4:54] in heaven and in earth.
[4:59] All power
[5:02] is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[5:06] I wonder does he take all God's power
[5:08] then?
[5:10] Or all the power both in heaven and
[5:12] earth? is it is in him now.
[5:16] All the power in both heaven and earth
[5:18] is given unto me. Where's God at with
[5:21] his power?
[5:24] Now, could Jesus lie?
[5:27] He couldn't lie.
[5:29] If he lied, then where are we?
[5:33] Now remember, he bears this in mind that
[5:37] the church of the living God, not the
[5:39] denomination, the church of the living
[5:41] God is built upon spiritual revelation.
[5:46] You get that in St. Matthew 17 or St.
[5:49] Matthew 16, it is where he said, he
[5:53] said, "Who does man say I am?" He said,
[5:56] "Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[5:58] living God," said Peter. He said,
[5:59] "Blessed art thou Simon, son of Jonas,
[6:02] flesh and blood seminary." Somebody else
[6:06] never revealed this to you, but my
[6:08] father which is in heaven, thou art
[6:10] Peter, upon this rock I'll build my
[6:13] church. Now see, the Catholic says upon
[6:16] Peter. If that's so, then he backslid.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; All right. The Protestant says upon
[6:23] Jesus,
[6:25] but not to be different, but to make the
[6:27] thing straight.
[6:29] neither on Jesus nor upon Peter, but
[6:32] upon the spiritual revelation. Flesh and
[6:35] blood has not revealed this to you, but
[6:36] my father which is in heaven has
[6:39] revealed this to you. Then the word
[6:41] that's wrote and parables and everything
[6:43] else can only be revealed. And the only
[6:46] truth will ever be known by is a
[6:48] spiritual revelation. And if your
[6:50] revelation doesn't tie it together,
[6:53] then your revelation's wrong.
[6:56] See, it must split. Like if you was
[6:58] putting a jigsaw puzzle together and you
[7:01] didn't have anything on the side here to
[7:03] to look, you'd get the scenes all mixed
[7:05] up. You'd say, "Well, I believe this
[7:07] goes here. I believe this goes there."
[7:08] That's a human mind. First thing you
[7:10] know, your scenery be wrong. Be a cow
[7:12] picking grass on top of a tree. See, so
[7:15] it it wouldn't work. See, but if you if
[7:18] you got something here to go by,
[7:21] to go by. Well, now you say, "Oh, God
[7:22] revealed to me something." think if it
[7:25] isn't according to this word and ties
[7:27] the word together, then your
[7:28] revelation's wrong. In the Old
[7:30] Testament,
[7:32] if a prophet prophesied,
[7:35] if a dreamer dreamed a dream, no matter
[7:37] how real it seemed, the first before the
[7:40] church ever would accept it, it had to
[7:42] be proven by the Yurum thundum. You know
[7:45] that that breastplate of Aaron where the
[7:47] life reflected. Now when that priesthood
[7:50] ended, the year of mathundum went with
[7:53] it. But we got a new year of mathundum.
[7:56] That's the word of God. And if your
[7:58] revelation doesn't tie, you say, "God
[8:00] revealed to me I should be baptized in
[8:02] the name of the father, son, and holy
[8:03] ghost." If that don't tie with the word
[8:05] from Genesis to Revelations to tie it
[8:07] together and your revelation's wrong.
[8:10] You say, "God revealed me, I should be
[8:11] baptized in Jesus name." If it doesn't
[8:14] tie with the word, then the son of them
[8:16] don't back it up. No matter how read it
[8:18] seems, this is the authentic
[8:22] word. This is God's thunder. Now,
[8:27] and Jesus, again, I quote, repeat. And
[8:30] Jesus came and spake unto them the 18th
[8:32] verse, saying, "All power is given to me
[8:35] in heaven and earth.
[8:38] Go ye therefore teach all nations,
[8:40] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[8:44] and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
[8:48] teaching them to observe all things
[8:50] whatsoever I have commanded you. Lo, I
[8:54] am with you always, even unto the end of
[8:56] the world. Amen.
[8:59] Now,
[9:00] I want to ask you something. Now, I just
[9:04] that's Matthew 28:19.
[9:07] the scripture you're asking me to
[9:08] explain what we have in view here this
[9:11] morning.
[9:13] Now, let's read that carefully. Just
[9:16] don't don't run over it. Read it
[9:18] carefully. I watch closely. Go ye
[9:22] therefore
[9:24] teach all nations, baptizing them
[9:29] in the name of the Father
[9:33] and of the Son. No, not in the name of
[9:36] the father, in the name of the son, in
[9:39] the name of the holy ghost. That's way
[9:41] people baptize baptized that way. That's
[9:44] not even scriptural. See, it isn't in
[9:46] the name of the father, the name of the
[9:48] son, in the name of the holy ghost.
[9:50] That's wrong. That's not scriptural.
[9:53] And it isn't the names of the father,
[9:57] son, and holy ghost. It's in the name. N
[10:00] singular.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; In the name
[10:03] &gt;&gt; name. Look up in the name.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now if there's any word
[10:10] that you don't understand, I'm waiting
[10:13] for sister uh Su there to find it. You
[10:15] got it there.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know what this
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Matthew 28:19
[10:18] &gt;&gt; 198
[10:19] &gt;&gt; 19. Now, sister Sue, I believe you was
[10:22] the one question the strongest. Now,
[10:24] does that say in the names of the
[10:27] father? The son says in the name of the
[10:30] father, in the name of the son. No. In
[10:33] the name of the father and of the son
[10:36] and of the holy ghost. Not in the name
[10:39] putting a name before each one but just
[10:41] in the name of the father and of the son
[10:44] and holy ghost. Now now we realize then
[10:48] there has to be one name there because
[10:51] it said one name.
[10:54] Well I want to ask you which one of them
[10:56] name should we baptize in then? Now, is
[11:00] father a name?
[11:04] No. So, we couldn't baptize in the name
[11:07] of the father because father isn't a
[11:08] name, is it?
[11:10] &gt;&gt; Well, in the name of the son, then we
[11:12] say, is a son a name?
[11:18] I'm a son. You're a son. He's son. Son's
[11:20] not a name, is it?
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Well, holy ghost thing in the name of
[11:24] the Holy Ghost.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; We all got the Holy Ghost. Well, here
[11:28] Gentile word
[11:29] &gt;&gt; uh the um let's say the in the name of
[11:33] the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is it a
[11:35] name?
[11:36] &gt;&gt; No, that's what it is. We're all human.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It is the Holy Ghost,
[11:42] but the Holy Ghost is not a name. That's
[11:45] what it is. We're all human, but that's
[11:48] not our name.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Spirit is not a name.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; See, no, it's there's three titles then,
[11:53] isn't it?
[11:54] Well, then what kind of a thing have we
[11:57] got here? Then he said, "Baptize them in
[12:00] the name of the father, son, and holy
[12:03] ghost." Well, the father's no name and
[12:05] son's no name and holy ghost is no name.
[12:07] They're not names. So, you couldn't use
[12:10] that for a name
[12:12] because there's no name to it at all to
[12:14] begin with.
[12:16] You understand that? There are not
[12:18] names. Holy Spirit.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; They are. It's just like I'm They call
[12:22] me a reverend. Some people call me a
[12:25] prophet. Some call me a preacher.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Well, now Yeah. I'm a father. I'm a son.
[12:31] I'm a human.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; But my name's William Brandon.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; But But Reverend, prophet, reverend,
[12:39] elder, and uh minister. That's titles
[12:42] that belong to me. Oh, then belongs to
[12:45] many other also like soul, body, and
[12:48] spirit. That belongs to me too. But it
[12:50] belongs to him, him, her, her, all. See,
[12:52] it's all the same. See, it's titled, but
[12:56] that's not my name. That's not your
[12:58] name. Soul, body, and spirit's not your
[13:00] name.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; That's not what that's what you are, but
[13:04] it's not your name. Or you are a lady,
[13:08] you are a mother, you are a wife,
[13:11] &gt;&gt; a daughter,
[13:12] &gt;&gt; a daughter.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. All them things. Then that's
[13:17] that's just what you are.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; And say you I've always called you
[13:22] doctor. You was a nurse.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; Say you are a doctor.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Well, uh you are a mother, too.
[13:30] But that's not your name. If I just
[13:32] wrote doctor, there's a lot of doctors.
[13:34] If I wrote nurse, there's a lot of
[13:35] nurses. See, but that's still not your
[13:38] name. So when anyone says they was
[13:40] baptized in the name of father, son, and
[13:42] host holy ghost, if they'd only think
[13:45] it's not even a mental, it's not, it's
[13:47] not even it's not even mentally right.
[13:50] A name of father, son, holy ghost. It's
[13:53] just like the Catholic said eternal
[13:55] sunship.
[13:57] The eternal sunship of Christ. How can
[14:00] the word make sense?
[14:03] How can he be a eternally be a son?
[14:08] son had was born off of eternal had no
[14:11] beginning or end.
[14:13] If they said there's an eternal hell.
[14:16] Bible said hell was created. Then how
[14:19] can it be eternal?
[14:22] There's no eternal hell. Hell was
[14:24] created for the devil and his angels.
[14:26] Not an eternal hell. Everything begin
[14:28] ends. Hell may burn for 100 billion
[14:31] years, but it has to have an end because
[14:34] everything begins end. That's the reason
[14:36] we can't die because we are part of God
[14:38] offsprings of his sons and daughters. We
[14:40] got eternal life. God's life. It never
[14:43] did begin, never will end.
[14:45] See,
[14:47] now this is pretty strong. If you don't
[14:49] understand it, I'm afraid I'll get you
[14:51] out on a limb here somewhere. I can talk
[14:53] to clergymen. Now,
[14:55] &gt;&gt; if you don't understand, you tell me
[14:56] because usually you talk to clergymen
[14:58] like this, you see. But um to you
[15:00] winning, you just ask me and you're my
[15:03] friend.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Jordan, I wanted to know.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I'm trying. You're
[15:08] you're all educated and you're you're
[15:10] all smart and I I don't want you to take
[15:13] this because brother Vandom said so. I'm
[15:15] a human being.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; I want you to take the word. And if you
[15:19] can find anybody that'll down that word,
[15:21] you bring them to me.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; If you can find anybody who says there's
[15:26] a contradiction in the word of God,
[15:27] bring them to me.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; It just won't be.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; It won't even try because it ain't
[15:33] there. See, now how could anybody be
[15:36] baptized? I want to ask you ladies
[15:38] something right now. Our new man,
[15:41] how could anybody be baptized in the
[15:43] name of father, son, holy ghost?
[15:48] How could you be baptized in the name of
[15:49] father, son, holy ghost? Don't you see
[15:51] the bottom of it? There's no such a
[15:53] thing as the name of father, son, holy
[15:55] ghost.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Just saying words over
[15:58] &gt;&gt; that's that's titles.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; Liy Valley just say Lily Valley, Rosa
[16:03] Sharon, Morning Star, Alpha Omega. It be
[16:06] the same. You can be baptized just as
[16:08] well. Said, I baptize you in the name of
[16:10] Alpha and Omega.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; The beginning and end be just as well.
[16:14] It's the title. I baptize you in the
[16:16] name of the little valley, the morning
[16:18] star and the rose of Sharon be just the
[16:20] same as title. But we know who it
[16:22] belongs to.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; But the there could be a lot of morning
[16:25] stars and lily of the valley and rose of
[16:27] Sharon. See, so
[16:29] &gt;&gt; not a father,
[16:30] &gt;&gt; not a father, son, holy ghost.
[16:33] is that our human soul, body, and spirit
[16:36] or whatever more you want to make it.
[16:38] Now,
[16:40] &gt;&gt; now there's something wrong here
[16:42] somewhere, isn't there? Now, you see
[16:44] that something's wrong here. We can't
[16:46] understand it then. Let's say
[16:49] now go ye therefore, teach all nations.
[16:53] Now,
[16:55] you're a nice little audience, and I I
[16:58] want to drill this so that you'll have a
[17:01] good understanding.
[17:03] See, cuz I don't know many of my
[17:06] brethren, I might hear this tape,
[17:10] I never uncize no man or person for
[17:14] their ideas of scripture. I base it up
[17:17] on if they're saved. They're trust in
[17:19] Jesus Christ. Whe they are Catholic,
[17:22] Protestant, Jew, or whatever they are,
[17:23] you're saved because you're born of
[17:26] Christ. But you've asked me a question.
[17:28] Why, brother Brand, would you baptize in
[17:30] the name of Jesus Christ? All right. And
[17:33] why would you disregard Father, Son, and
[17:35] Holy Ghost? That's your question.
[17:38] And as your brethren, as a servant of
[17:40] Christ, I'm duty bound to answer you.
[17:43] All right. Now therefore when you find
[17:46] out here to make this contradiction now
[17:48] just 10 days after this after Jesus said
[17:51] this Peter had the keys of the kingdom.
[17:54] Matthew 16 I not thou art Peter upon
[17:57] this rock build my church so forth and I
[18:01] say it th Peter and I give unto thee the
[18:04] keys of the kingdom. Whatever you bind
[18:06] on earth I'll bind it in heaven. What
[18:08] you loose on earth I'll loose it in
[18:10] heaven. Now that same man that had the
[18:12] keys
[18:14] turned right back around 10 days after
[18:16] Jesus said this and said, "Repent and be
[18:19] baptized every one of you in the name of
[18:21] Jesus Christ or your missionary sin."
[18:24] Did you ever stop to think that Jesus
[18:27] would give a man that would be that
[18:28] scrupled up, the keys to the kingdom
[18:33] that would turn around and do vice versa
[18:35] what he said not to do?
[18:39] the God of heaven manifested in flesh
[18:41] and would turn the keys over to a man
[18:43] that would make a mistake like that.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; The very first shot to do a thing like
[18:47] that,
[18:48] &gt;&gt; he didn't do it.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; I'm always bothered on that.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now just now, now notice
[18:56] he couldn't do that.
[18:59] But why did he give them keys to Peter
[19:01] then? He just plainly quoted it.
[19:06] Peter,
[19:08] you never learned this from some church
[19:10] or some seminary,
[19:12] but it was a revelation that come from
[19:15] heaven. And upon this same revelation
[19:18] from heaven to straighten out the word
[19:20] of God, I'll build my church.
[19:24] He know Peter e he didn't know
[19:27] mathematics.
[19:28] Peter didn't know algebra perhaps or
[19:31] neither did he know gerometry or or I
[19:35] think it said that he was an ignorant
[19:36] and an unlearned man according to acts
[19:39] the 4th chapter acts the third chapter I
[19:43] believe said perceiving that they were
[19:45] both ignorant and unlearned he and John
[19:47] had to heal the man at the gate called
[19:49] beautiful but taken notice that they had
[19:51] been with Jesus so you see he didn't lay
[19:54] it upon his seminary uh theology that he
[19:57] could reveal reve this to him.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Not upon all his seminary experience cuz
[20:04] he had none. He doesn't yet today.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; No, I know.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; But he reveals it, see the one that had
[20:11] the revelation of it. Therefore, he
[20:14] could trust it to Peter. He might not
[20:16] have been able to trust it to Matthew or
[20:18] to John or to the rest of Peter had the
[20:22] revelation. So then Peter turns around
[20:24] and says,
[20:27] "Repent and be baptized in the name of
[20:29] Jesus Christ, every one of you, in the
[20:31] name of Jesus Christ, see for the
[20:33] remission of sins, and you shall receive
[20:35] the gift of the Holy Ghost, the promises
[20:37] to you." The man that had the keys that
[20:40] unlocked the kingdom for the first time,
[20:44] turning around and doing vice versa,
[20:46] what Jesus said not to do. Now, it's
[20:49] either he was wrong. He made a mistake.
[20:53] He didn't follow out our Lord's or
[20:55] either he had a revelation of truth
[20:58] &gt;&gt; that the rest of them was which was
[21:00] beyond what any of the rest of them had.
[21:03] Now, let's just stop before we go back.
[21:06] Just a minute. If it would have been
[21:08] wrong, why did God recognize it then and
[21:10] command all the rest of them down to the
[21:12] Bible to be baptized in the name of
[21:13] Jesus Christ? And every person in the
[21:17] Bible
[21:18] was baptized in the name of Jesus
[21:20] Christ. And every person up to the or
[21:24] organation organization of Catholic
[21:27] Church was baptized in the name of Jesus
[21:29] Christ. It's an IC council. They formed
[21:32] this baptism of father, son, holy ghost
[21:36] making a triune God out of one true God
[21:40] to bring in their their trinity
[21:44] and as God in the beginning know that
[21:47] man would fall. Therefore, he put him on
[21:50] free moral agency knowing because he
[21:52] could display his attributes to be a
[21:54] father, to be a son, to be a healer, to
[21:58] be a savior. How could he save that
[22:01] something lost? And in God was the
[22:03] attributes before there even was an
[22:06] angel or a molecule or anything. God was
[22:09] by himself alone. But he wasn't God
[22:11] because God is an object of worship.
[22:14] There was nothing for him to worship.
[22:16] Nothing to worship him. But his
[22:18] attributes attributes
[22:21] displayed
[22:23] something and made an angel that he was
[22:25] God. Then he made a man giving free
[22:28] moral agency. He fell. Then when he
[22:30] fell, he become a savior. In the fall,
[22:33] he took sick sickness. So he becomes a
[22:35] healer. See, it's disciplining God's
[22:37] attributes. See what I mean? Now, he
[22:41] also know that there had to be a lost
[22:43] people and a saved people. There had to
[22:46] be a false baptism and a So he puts it
[22:49] here
[22:51] again, a tree of knowledge. Here's one.
[22:53] Acts 2:38 1 Matthew 28:19.
[22:57] So how was it revealed to Abel? Abel by
[23:00] faith offered unto God a more excellent
[23:02] sacrifice. He didn't have no Bible to go
[23:05] by. So it must have been revelation to
[23:07] Abel.
[23:09] There was both boys. If God only
[23:12] requires a worship, then God was unjust
[23:16] to condemn Cain.
[23:19] Cain made an altar, built a church,
[23:22] worshiped, and made a sacrifice. Every
[23:24] religious thing that Abel did, so did
[23:26] Cain. Is that right? But Abel
[23:32] by revelation
[23:35] offered to God revelation. He walked by
[23:38] faith.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; A more excellent sacrifice. How did Abel
[23:43] know it that it wasn't fruit
[23:47] or the fields that Cain offered? It was
[23:50] blood that brought him from the garden.
[23:51] Life was not in the fruit. Blood brought
[23:54] the light. It was revealed to him. A
[23:58] revelation. Here's the same basis he
[24:01] puts us on that he did on them back
[24:04] there. A revelation.
[24:07] Now, there can't be a contradiction.
[24:10] Now,
[24:13] you all wasn't always Christians.
[24:16] You were born sinners.
[24:18] I imagine as a little girl, I I don't
[24:20] know you did or not, but I'm going to
[24:22] take all of us in the room
[24:25] to make an illustration here now so that
[24:27] you'll understand.
[24:30] Uh when you were little girls, say you
[24:34] read Love Story magazine. Most all
[24:36] little girls do. any kind of magazine
[24:38] would have to be a love story. Any
[24:40] store?
[24:41] Nice. Could not been a one of these
[24:44] modern bookstand stores, but any store
[24:47] even Romeo and Juliet. See, well, you um
[24:50] you uh you you read a lot of story and
[24:53] I'm showing you this way now so that you
[24:55] can catch it in a parable.
[24:58] If you picked up a story book and you
[25:09] [Music]
