you sister rochelle actually since yesterday i've been thinking of calling sister rochelle to get her to get ready for this song and then the day went through and i forget early this morning i remembered her again and i said no i hate taking people by surprise even though a lot of the times when you do it it becomes a lot of blessing i remember cisco zen came here that night i have not forgotten it praise be to god so even when i was in the pastor's office again when i thought of the song i said let me cross this rasher i said no let's just make it a congregational song and then i come and it happens that she has to sing [Music] god never makes a mistake praise be to god you are all warmly welcome it's good to see you once again welcome see snack here and um nyquisha right oh my goodness forgive me [Applause] yeah i can see my brother i've never seen this yes my brother i haven't seen you smiling but this mouth is different i don't mean to put you another spot that's good god bless you guys yes i hope we are all prayed up yes it takes a lot to come behind here um if i should tell you how i feel this morning it's like um how did they call it again an amateur paratrooper who has to jump out of the plane anyhow and he knows that he has no skills whatsoever and he has to jump anyhow and the only confidence and the trust he has is in the parachute and he is jumping in a house and he knows he can go by the head he can go on the side but he has a lot of confidence in his parachute knowing that when he pulls the rope it's going to open it doesn't matter how he goes but he knows he's going to have a soft landing praise be to god that is how i feel this morning happy to see you guys and it's always heartwarming um i wish i could speak a little bit of french but thank god but i hope he's behind and he's doing a very good job good to see you um father and mother of the bride and the groom we appreciate that yes so we have in our mist there we go yeah to tell you that i'm a number two for a trooper this morning i remember one time a preacher came he was in the pastor's office i went to do something he was standing behind the door i said brother relax when we are ready i'll come for you and then you're also standing there i came out and then i had to go back in i went there he was standing like a soldier with his bible in his hand ready to come i said brother when we are ready i will come call you he said brother dan is difficult to relax yes it is difficult to relax praise be to god so brother gilbert shambo that's a bro god bless you brother and you are welcome amen and um shall we go before the lord in prayer we have um two prayer requests here uh one from brother peterson he's asking us to pray for him he has a special need and the family will be following the service online today and another prayer little hannah is not feeling fine and we are going to pray uh remember them before the lord shall we pray our lord and our master jesus we thank this so much oh god that we have gathered together this morning to seek your face concerning the race that that have said before us we have not come to hear a man speak for if it is to hear a man speak there are many public speakers out there but father every one of us has come to hear from you wealth of eternal life it doesn't matter how high we have risen your holy word says come up higher there is still room to go up higher let us mount up with wings as eagles this morning that we may sow unto higher heights help us lord jesus to save you in spirit and in truth with all our hearts with all our souls with all our strength and with every fiber of our being as the days are drawn into a head help us dear lord jesus not to be distracted by the tense of this life help us to keep our focus on you we are so very much grateful for being the altar and the finisher of our faith for we have this confidence lord that the good works you have started in us you will surely bring you to a completion there is no doubt whatsoever all that the father have given you wonderful jesus they would come there is nothing that would stop us lord nothing in the past nothing in the present and nothing in the future thank you so much dear lord jesus for thine mighty and wondrous works in our lives oh god may you come and through your word speak to your people we remember brother one in alaska before you this morning and we pray dear lord jesus that you would use him to glorify your holy name in the last week or two father oh god he has gone through a lot and personally i was not even thinking he was going to make this journey but he had to do it anyhow may you nourish his strength and grant him wisdom and let him be a blessing father to the saints in alaska and whatsoever then sons and daughters are gathered together this morning father oh god may we just pass by and breathe over your word into their souls father oh god and honor yourself in their lives in one way or the other father we lift a little hannah before you and we also want to commit brother tim into your hands who is not feeling fine because we have a promise lord that by your stripes we were healed and we are coming by the way of your word this morning that you will touch your children in a very special way and deliver them further from every plan of the enemy and heal their bodies in jesus name but a peter sim says he has a special need on his heart whatever they need is father you know about it we don't have to know it lord but you know we commit them into your hands and we pray that you speak to this need and grant it unto him father we pray in jesus name come and take complete control over the service father and let our name be glorified in jesus name amen praise be to god shall we just stand for the reason of the word joel joel one joel 1 1-4 praise the lord the word of the lord came the word of the lord that came to joel the son of faithful hear this you old man and give ear all your inhabitants of the land have this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell you your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the palmer worm have left have the locals eating and that which the locals have left have the conquer worm eating and that which the cankerworm have left have the caterpillar eating praise be to god job um joel 2 25. joel 2 25 and i will restore to you the years that the look of the locust has eaten and the counterworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i send among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the lord and praise the name of the lord your god that have dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy and your old man shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit praise be to god shall we be seated the title of my message this morning is i will restore save the lord it's a message the prophet preached and we all know that there is nobody that can preach the message that brother preaches it but i am just taking a thought from this message trusting that god is just going to come through the word and bless as many of us that have gathered this morning praise be to god i will restore says the lord praise be to god it's not an easy road we've been called to walk on it cost god a lot it cost him to have you seated here this morning he had to send his only begotten son who came and gave his life we are seated here that it cost god a lot to bring us here and it has to cost you a lot it would also cost you in your service to god it will cost you in one way or the other it's going to cost you something amen like david said that he would not offer god a sacrifice without a cost that was when satan got david to number the children of israel and a displeased god and god gave david three things to choose from but we are serving such a wonderful and merciful god that at the end of it all god came to david according to the instructions of the angel of the lord and told him to go and then perform a sacrifice and when david went to that jebusite anon and he wanted to buy his threshing floor now look at it when you know that it has to cost you something to save god there is no price too high there is no price that is too much if you know you are doing it for the lord there is no price that is too much to pay when david came to anon and said god had come to me by the instruction of the almighty god through his angel asking me to come and buy this land and perform a sacrifice what did arnold say he said you know what i am giving you this land free of charge i don't care what it cost i am giving it to you not only that i am also going to give you the boo that you are going to use to perform this sacrifice not only that the elements of the threshing floor i'm giving them to you as wood not only that i'm even going to supply the heat press be to god for goodness sake what can we give to god which he has not already given to us and david said no i would not offer to god any sacrifice without a cost i appreciate it but i'm going to pay for it and he paid him and performed the sacrifice in whatever way remember that it will cost you something in your service to god whatever it is i don't know but it will cost you something it can cost your very own life and we saw if you read the the the foxes book of matthias and you see the way they kill the believers not because they did anything wrong not because they committed any crime but for their love their love their heart for god they died very gruesome death and that didn't mean anything to them we have a promise the lord jesus said if you save your life you will look if you seek to save your life you will lose it but if you lose your life for my sake you will be saved so when you have served god faithfully and it would cost you even your life you know that you have a promise praise be to god and sometimes what it will cost you is your pride and your arrogance yourself pray that i go yes sometimes that is what is going to cause you you have to bring your shoulder down and let go talk to you we can talk about neymar that syrian captain of the host of the of of of of um the king of israel syria he was a leper but he had a maiden in his house from the land of israel and one day she went to her mistress and told her mistress if my lord had gone to see the prophet in israel he was going to get healed he will heal him of his leprosy and the message finally gets to to to to naaman naaman tells the king of syria he gives him a letter go and hand it over to the king of israel he guessed that we know the story how he gives him the letter he got so angry he tore his reign his mantle he said am i god to heal you and it came to pass that when he lies ahead of it he said why should you rent your mantle send him over and he would know that there is a prophet of god in the land and he went with his talents of silver and gold and on horses and camels terrorists and when he got there he thought the man of god was coming out to come and see him to salute him to bow before him he never even came out elijah was inside and he sent his servant go tell him to go and dip himself seven times in the jordan and he'll be clean when the message got to him he got offended he says there are better rivers in damascus i mean in in in syria can't i bought there and get clean why should i have to come and buff in the mighty waters of the jordan and he left very angry and when he got there his servants came he said if he had asked you to do something greater wouldn't you have done it you carried silver and gold on you he have asked you to do something greater once you have done it he's just asking you god dip yourself in the jordan seven times is that something too hard to do a lot of the times that is what we feel as christians that when people have problems and then they come to us instead of helping them to deal with it we found the flames why should he tell you that who is he come on don't do it he didn't even respect you why didn't he come out no they spoke sense to him some of the times that is all we need to get back online spoke sense to him and then he had to bring his shoulders down he went back went into the jordan one came out two came out three five times six he asked me to go inside seven times i have gone in six already something should have started happening my daddy has changed something says just walk out and go he was making a fool out of you he said no i will try for the last time the seventh time he goes in and comes out and lo and behold the leprosy is gone praise be to god he was shocked he went back to the man of god he was lost of west and listen to what he says that now i know praise be to god not a feeling [Music] not somebody's imagination but now i know that in all of the earth there is no god by the god of israel praise be to god now i know it would cost you something in your work with god we make a lot of sacrifices yes some worked last night and they are here some have driven 100 miles over 100 miles to come here that is a lot of sacrifice it doesn't mean if you are coming 5-10 miles away it's not a sacrifice in fact for you to get up in the morning and push everything aside and then get ready to come to the house of god it's a lot of sacrifice praise be to god but there is something i want us to look at this morning a lot of you know that for some months my truck the number plate behind my truck was hanging like this yes and that made me so popular in saint michael i'll be sitting in a kind of policeman will come say do you know your number plate is falling i said oh yes i'm aware of it thank you sir the other day i was just parked by the roadside a squad car came and stopped beside me two police officers say are you aware no more please i said yes sir i am aware of it but i got so sad one day a lady old enough to be my mother i was at a diary queen in saint michael and then this woman came out of a car it was very cold at the time and then she struggled walked walked i saw her walking coming and then she comes to me then i wrote down my glasses now do you know another plate is falling i saw yeah and i feel so sorry i did that to her the other day the police pushed me over because i was reaching out to take my phone and he saw me so he came behind me do you know another plate is falling i say yes [Music] so i became so popular not for any good reason so i went my with my wife and i went to cobons in albertville we parked and here comes a man then he stops he said you know never played this following i said yes i said it's been this way for about six months [Music] then he looks at me do you need help i said yes then he passed the sky he comes and he says i'm your brother and um i was kind of taken aback because i mean if you should tell me about i know but then i said okay then he told me then he started the story how that he was born in brussels he was three months old his parents took him to congo and he's been in congo all his life and he's a missionary with his wife and the whole family is missionary apart from one brother who is just going astray and they are praying for him i say keep praying the lord will answer your prayer and then i go to his house to for him to fix my number plate and they were just talking one thing from the other then he tells me he has been in the missionary field all his life and i said wow this is a huge sacrifice this is why i am bringing us he said then i told him this is a huge sacrifice he said no it's not a sacrifice it's a blessing my goodness my faith was challenged my faith was challenged that somebody that has left the comfort here and is in africa doing missionary work all his life tells me that it is not a sacrifice and it's a blessing i said it's rightly spoken for god to trust you well enough with his word to be a voice unto him to god preaching his word is nothing but a blessing for god to trust you well enough with a people to shepherd over it's not a sacrifice but a blessing as a matter of fact for god to trust you well enough with his word knowing that you believe and live by it is a blessing and not a sacrifice it is not to say that you are not making any sacrifices let god see your labor of love let god see you making that sacrifice but you look at it from the point of a blessing because when you begin to look at it as a sacrifice guess what it is what you are doing it now becomes what your effort it becomes what your ability it becomes what you are doing but when you begin to see it as a blessing it is no longer you you are seeing the hand of god what god is doing in your life it is not to say there is no sacrifice to it but let god see you making that sacrifice you don't look at it as a sacrifice see it as a blessing he told me two things i'm keeping the next one praise be to god within that short time when i see any man in the street he is a creation of god i respect them whether we are we go to the same church it doesn't make any difference you don't know who a child of god is never look mean on anybody never look down on anybody [Applause] and he told me two things i'm keeping the second one praise be to god and the day i tell you the second one i'll let you know that is the story just remember there are a lot of sacrifices we make there are a lot of struggles we'll go through anything and everything that has life has a struggle do not let your struggle seem so special don't let it look so strange know that everybody is struggling one way or the other anything that has life has struggles we can talk about the fishes in the sea they are struggles when the worlds come and is forcing them onto the land they are struggling to swim back it's a struggle when they are swimming they see the fisherman's hook they are running away from it and then they see the mass the fisherman's net they are running away from it and before the away the shark is coming they are running away before the aware the whale is coming they are running away they have struggles just look at it from the point of this i love farming and where i come from in the hinterlands in ghana there are stones a lot more stones than there are farming lands and the people would farm anyhow and there are places where they even gather the stones together so they can plant now when they are planting whether they the earth there is shallow or not they plant anyhow and then when the crops don't germinate anyhow because there is life in that seed and then it germinates and then you would realize that those that are sitting very well on good soil where the depth of the soil is very high they are growing very well but those that have very thin earth and their stone under they just come up and they are struggling and the farmer is aware of them he gives them more attention he gives them more attention his focus is on the other side better his focus is here the more and the plant doesn't say oh because there is a rock beneath i am going to just cease no they just grow anyhow they are growing anyhow they never give up and when those on the good soil are burying thousand thousand seeds on a cob 500 on a cup 100 on a cup that one sometimes would bear maybe 10 or 20. you open it you just see the fruit i mean the seeds dotted all around but it is a genuine seed it is no less a seed than the other one it is a genuine seed and when the farmer harvests those ones with a thousand the 500 the 100 when he comes to those ones with the 10 20 seas he harvests them he doesn't say because you didn't do well i'm just abandoning you he will go in and he will pick every one of them and not only that wherever the farmer is going to keep those ones with a thousand cops i mean with a thousand seats and the 500 seats that is the same ban in which he is going to keep that cup with the two seas the three c's the tenses look whatever you find yourself doing for god the bible says they that compare themselves among themselves are not wise don't see whatever you find yourself doing no matter how small it is do it and do it faithfully if god has given you an assignment don't look down upon it and you say oh this is too small i wish i had this one day no godliness with contentment is a great game no matter how small it is be happy that god has given it to you and do it and do it generously praise be to god do it and do it generously the fact that you are struggling is a sign that you have life praise be to god it's a sign that there is life in here because there are people that are living a kind of life and they are comfortable living that life you get so close to it and something in you just kicks up and you get so miracle so so so so uncomfortable it's a sign that there is life in you it's not a sign of weakness when a man is dead what struggles do they have to go through there is no life in that body if you have any struggles it's a sign that you have life i will restore say the lord when the brother started this message he said the secret of his ministry the secret of his ministry now when you look at the man of god with all the miracles the signs the wonders and he is saying that the secret of my ministry was this you want to listen and he said the secret of his ministry was love wonderful the secret of his ministry was nothing but love and that he has seen the love working human life and in animal life and we all know that story about how that killer buu just came to finish him up but he said out of love and then again the beast and the maniac oh he said out of love he spoke to the bull and the beast out of love love is so so strong a weapon not the love of men but the love of god praise be to god the love of men would fail you can never trust the love of men love me i love you it's no love like sunday school this morning when brother was playing there was a part that said if you have to love and be loved back then what have you what is so special about it if you have to do somebody good because they have done you good what is so special about it there is nothing special about it because the hiddens even do that human love is just like the what the the weather in minnesota praise the lord you know it's supposed to be spring and then you get out and there is snow you leave your house in the morning the water is good before your weight has just changed and it has got so chilly you can't depend on human love we are talking about the love of god and god is an embodiment of love we are sons and daughters of the most high god and love is at the core of his dna and if you are child of god you have the love of god you may not have it today but you are working your way there praise be to god you will have that love of god in you why because you are a son of god why because you are a daughter of god and if god is love his children will be loved he said love love was the secret of his ministry praise be to god how i want to pray for love that i will have more of the love of god in me and verbal tells a story it is far down my nose i don't know which part of it we may never even come to it but talks about the woman he went somewhere to go eat and then he saw these two drunkards that were sitting with a bowl of whiskey and just described the woman from head to toe it was not a good picture and then he condemned her in his heart but when he he just went out to go and pray behind the door and then he stepped out and a vision just broke before him and in the vision he saw a world that was just hanging in space going round and he saw around it a rainbow and then he heard a voice that if it hadn't been for the blood of the lord jesus that is holding the wrath of god god would have consumed this earth destroyed it but it is the blood the blood the blood of the lord jesus that is holding back his wrath and then as he was looking he saw a man then he drew closer and he saw that he was just bleeding he was just bloody all over a bloody man when he said hanging on one side and it was the lord jesus christ and then he came closer and the lord told him that my my blood has just served us as a bumper as a bumper around you and you know what the bumper of a car does so my blood sucks as a bumper around you and then he was still looking at it he said oh lord i'm so sorry he started apologizing and then he saw a book lying by his side written all over sins with sins written all over it and then he took that book my brother said on it was written his name but the lord took that book and wrote on it with his blood pardon and then put it on his side and the lord turned to him and said you see i have pardoned you but you are condemning that woman let's learn to be merciful be merciful if you see people in the condition don't be too hasty to condemn show mercy brother brother said he went back inside there and when he got in there the other drunkard partner had left he had to go use the room or something and then he went to hell and then he just is a 65 year old woman old enough to be his grandmother and she was trying to put his i said no he said i'm brother branham he said oh i need a man in the arena he said yes he said have you been a christian before you say yes i was one time but i got married and a man blah blah blah blah blah and now i might and then brother braham said that god is willing to forgive you he said oh is he ready to accept me the way i am he said yes and right there and then she gave up her life and he went on to say that what the world is actually looking for is love that is what they are looking for and you wonder how would they know that you have love for them if a bull can sense the love of god if beasts know what the love of god is and they could sense it then it shows that if there is love there people around you would sense it sometimes like i said before the love is not there sometimes it is infatuation infatuation is as good as love until there is trouble if you think you love somebody well enough wait until they offend you and see whether there is still love then you know yes there is love but if that love is until something happens and you can point to it and say from that time i didn't like him anymore it shows that he didn't even love you from the beginning praise be to god what the people need is love they want to see the love of god they are hungry for the love of god and this is the love of god that brings the results paul said even though i speak in the tongues of men and angels and have not love it profiteth nothing and he goes on to talk about if there are if there are if there are if there are prophecies if there are signs if there are wonders they will fail and they will cease yes but the love of god would never fail praise be to god i will restore i will restore sayeth the lord praise be to god when god created the heavens and the earth and everything was perfect in the garden and there was no man to till the earth and god found man out of the dust of the earth and gave man dominion over everything everything there is in the garden there was perfect harmony there was peace there was tranquility everything was in order man had dominion over the creation of god but that was going to be the state because there was an unwanted guest in the garden the bible says in the midst of the garden there were two trees the god commanded his children they could eat of any of the trees in the garden but of the tree in the midst of the garden they should not touch it or even eat it for the very day they eat they would die but you know the adventure of man didn't start today mine became so adventurous we know the story how they ended up eating it now growing up we always said it was it was it was it was it was it was an apple it was an apple and we had so religiously to it maybe for one or two who are here now we know by the grace of god that it was not an april the 8th the god we are serving is the same yesterday today and forever if he did one thing yesterday under some condition he would do it again today under the same condition if people ate apple if they ate apple and they realized they were naked and their house opened then when we eat apple today we should go through that as the prophet god would say let's pass on the apple and see how many people will eat it and then realize they're in their birthday suit let's pass on the apple but in the garden there was a creature as the bread of god said that was so close to man so close till his blood could mingle with the blood of man and the devil realizing that went through that serpent to go and beguile the woman causing the fall and when that happened when that happened man started running away from god and the beast of the field started running away from man because they couldn't trust man anymore adam lost his authority he lost his power as a son of god remember he didn't lose his sonship eve did not lose if there is no way that forgive me her daughtership praise be to god they were still children of god but they had lost that authority when adam could just come up in the morning and tell this mountain move i want to see the sun yes i mean there was no suspicion between the animals but because of that one single act now all the animals were at loggerheads there was confusion there was death sickness farming all because of that one act but god still wanted to have a relationship with his children the love of god don't ever estimate the love of god god still had love for his children never underestimate the love of god what the love of god can do in the life of a man in the first place none of us did anything to marry the love of god what could you as a human being have done to marriage the love of god nothing god just loved us because he loved us end of story it was not because of your works and if you did not do anything to marriage the love of god do you think there is anything you can do to lose the love of god there is nothing you can do to lose the love of god if you decide to be wayward if you decide to be wayward you only make life more difficult for yourself but god would not lose you and god offered himself a lamb and he clothed them with the animal's king now through that act if conceived and when adam knew his wife she conceived so now there were two twins in the womb of eve now brother brother trace he talks about the two spirits the spirit of god in the spirit of the devil he traces right from the garden from the two trees now they have taken on a different form word of god one of the devil in the womb of eve cain was of his father the devil king was not of god and abel was of his father adam and others of god so abel was of god and then here they come they gave they i if if it gives birth and now they are in the same house can you imagine right in the midst of the garden those two trees stood side by side and here they are in the womb of if side by side now they are born in the same home side by side and you can trace you can trace the two rules and again today this morning sunday school brother jordan just tied right on tracing the genealogy of the lord jesus christ and again you can trace the energy all the way from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil through cain nimrod you can trace that all the way to judas praise be to god and again jesus judas side by side side by side those two spirits are always side by side side by side we'll get there very soon now brad brown says something when those two children grilled and they were offering a sacrifice but branham said that cain was a true believer in god i'm quoting what the prophet said that he was a true believer in god not a make believer that makes the hell on your back to stand up right i know i don't have some praise be to god he was a true believer as much as abel was say you believe in god can't believe in god you say you pray to god can't pray to god you say you offer sacrifices to god can offer sacrifices to god and as a matter of fact if it was just by sight between the two altars the author of ken was by far more beautiful than the author of abel he had everything so organized so religious and it was so beautiful but god was not in it the only difference there was between ken and abel was that a bear by revelation knew what god was looking for because he heard of the fall and how god came down and offered a lamp for a sacrifice so he knew that it had to be by blood and can you imagine he was a keeper of sheep he went there just caught one sheep just came on the field took us a crooked stone a rust stone started gushing the throat of the of the sheep and by the time he was done he was bloody all over a bloody mess but god was satisfied in that it is either according to the parting of god or you have missed it it has to be by god's provided way if it is not according to god's provided way you have missed it do not put your personal opinion into it your feelings must get out of it it may not make sense to you it doesn't have to make sense to you do it because it is the will of god do it because the word of god says so now even though i don't understand it i'm going to do it anyhow because it is the word of god praise be to god and revelation upon this rock of revelation i built my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it revelation is so important so so so important that is what differentiates between a true believer and somebody that is just plain religion it doesn't take religion to please god you can kill yourself it doesn't take religion to please god god is not in the beauty of it no it doesn't take religion and without revelation without revelation the bible says the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life without revelation all you have is the letter the best you can become is an intellectual giant but there is nothing here it takes a revelation to get in there praise be to god and we know the story how cain killed abel and god appointed herself in his place and then the story goes on and on and on now there was confusion every time the devil makes a move god makes a move the devil had made a move now when you go to the book of revelations when john in his partner's uh of island of fact was vision why he saw that there was a book and the hand of heather sat on the throne and cried who is ready to take this book to open the season to losing it thereof there was nobody but there was a lamp right from the midst of the throne of god that came and took that book and opened the seals and that lamp that lambda was slain before the foundation of the world was going to come to destroy every work of the enemy every time the devil makes a move god makes a move it's like that it's it's just like the chess the chess game i have never played chess before i remember making fun of it one time i don't know how to play chess but one thing i know that there are always two hands when one hand makes a move you can't move twice at a time another hand also comes and make a counter move so for every time the devil makes a move an inferior move god makes a counter move a superior one the bible says when the enemy comes against us like a flood the spirit of god will lift up a standard against him for every time the devil makes a move god also makes a move we are the marbles on the chessboard you don't decide what you want to do you don't decide where you want to go but there is a divine hand that controls your life the bible says the sense of the righteous are ordered of the lord there is a divine hand that keeps telling you that sometimes you don't even know what you are doing but you know that god is in control praise be to god anytime the devil makes a move god makes a move the devil had made a move i will restore i will restore it means that once upon a time everything was beautiful once upon a time it was good once upon a time it was a life but now it has gone wrong it is dead there is confusion there is chaos that i am going to restore it is a promise i have a few things here now our resource here the lord um let me take i have cast a whole lot of paragraphs okay now the palmer worm rarely speaking the conquer worm the caterpillar they feed on the leaves and the tender branches now before i get there yes i said note i just wrote down now when these conquer worms and the palmer worms and the catapillars come they don't come to uproot the tree they don't come with a chainsaw to cut it down they just go to the leaves and then they feed on the leaves and they destroy it now guess what the life of the plant or the life of the tree depends on the leaves because when sun shines the leaves pick the energy from the sun and they use that to prepare their food and then that goes through the plant goes through the lifeline and then that's how the plant gets its food so these worms they'll go and then they cut off the sauce of food for the plant and a human being when you don't eat you die i don't know for how long but if you don't eat eventually you die some may die before others but eventually everybody would die and the same way when a plant is not getting its food it will die so what the plant did these swamps do they just come and then they interrupt the food supply of the tree and because then the food is not that the tree is not getting its food it ends up dying if the devil can get you away from the word of god the bible says that what is this scripture it's a very common scripture can somebody help me that we do not leave our bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god so our soul feeds on the word of god if the devil can get you away from the word of god he is done with you he is done with you you'll be living physically but spiritually you are dead and that is what these worms do so they interfere with the full supply now the brother says that which the catholic church have left have the lutherans eating and that which the lutherans have left have the wesleyans eating and that which the westerners have left have the presbyter eating according okay very good uh in the message why i am not a holy roller god sent us his prophet micah 4 5 and 6 into brackets restoring us to the faith of our fathers i will restore say the lord it wasn't brother branham it was god restoring the church beloved i give you all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation that you would endlessly content for the faith that was once delivered to the saints i said this today if you believe me to be god's servant you are now living in the day of restoration of the faith that was once delivered to the saints living under the power of the latter reign of the holy ghost church thus raising today calling great doctrines of divinities of everything out of all the denominations and that was his ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the apostolic fathers what was he doing restoring a message to restore us to restore us to the faith of our fathers now notice after a while down come the wind again with a great gush that was when the prophet went for a hunting expedition and um he was telling us this story and those old trees just moaned and groaned i thought well what wha wha what does this mean and a little text over in endural come to my mind what the palmer worm has left has the caterpillar eating what a caterpillar has left has the locals eating and all these little insects i was thinking on that that each of those insects are all the same insect it's just a different spirit goes away as one and comes back as another the palmer when caterpillar locus is all the same insect and then just a different stage of it of his life and i thought yes that's right well then i see why the lord has stopped me here these churches you know they stand way up high like that they build their spire until is so high it looks all over the city and mine just about as dead as the three wolves there were one streets sure they were all filled with a spirit way back under the lutron and metal this age and so forth but what the nutrients left the method is eating what the method is left the baptist got it and why the baptist left the pentagon has got it oh the poor trees eating down that's just about all there was to it back in the beginning that tree god's heritage baghdad which was his vine history it was a very new it was a new church they had fellowship love they had bible doctrine they had everything just right and along come one insect to eat this out and another to eat that out till it's become nothing but a great big old empty spooky looking place that's about it now that's that's about right and then every time the wind blew they just moan like i said that's right every time god repeats the pentecostal experience the only thing these big old marks can do is to stand there and go days of miracles surpassed there is no such thing as that just as spooky as it can be to try to drive the people away from it i thought well then why do you send me do you send me the wind lord why do you send it anyhow they are done they are finished they will never receive it just like them old cow heights was done dried and set there is no way of trying to tell them anything because they would never believe it they done got set and callused and dried out and that's all about it i thought why do you send me why do you send the wind then but then i remembered joe i remember jewel said i will restore say the lord i will give back to you all the years the caterpillar has eaten and the locust has eaten why would it be lord and i noticed down underneath these dry trees come up a bunch of undergrowth a little bunch of trees they are green that's true the church might act a little green but brother is flexible to the wind of god when it blows every time the wind would blow those little trees just laughed and jumped enjoyed boy i said if that and an old-fashioned pentecostal meeting i never seen one oh them little trees when the wind blows are flexible they don't say i can't go to that meeting i am a presbyterian i don't belong to the assemblies oh i wouldn't cooperate with that at all you all steve starts half dead what's the matter what we need today is a restoration of the genuine pentecostal shaking down experience in the churches of the living god praise be to god i thought lord will you do it then i seen that little bunch of backwash they called what they they called us they spoilers or offcast or whatever it is but i say well they were green they might be green but they are flexible to the wind they can give but then they got life in them anyhow that's one good thing i thought what do you shake them why do you shake them so hard every time you shake a tree it loses its roots every time you shake a tree it loses its roots and when the wind comes to tear down the tree and the tree goes down on one side what happens is that the earth under it gets so losing now the roots can go deeper and get grounded and now it becomes an enemy to the wind when trials and temptations come amen they don't come to just take you out of the way they come to losing the earth under you so you can go deeper and possess the earth that is what the word of god does in a man's life this earth here must be possessed and the only thing sometimes we we hate we hate we hate correction we have trials beg they are for a good cause god will not send you a trial because he hates you he will not send you a trial because he wants you to fail because there is a potential in you that you do not even have an idea of it takes the trials it takes the the problems to manifest them praise be to god without those trials you are like a bastard there are errors a lot of storms on the way praise be to god i'm watching my time there are a lot of storms on the way you may be going through one now you may know somebody that is going through one now we used to have a common saying that when you see your neighbor's house on fire there is a time to get water ready by us because after the fire is done consume your neighbor's house it may be your turn that is not a time to stand and laugh it's a time to get ready because when that fire is done it may be your turn you may be going through now you may know somebody that is going through one now it is not a time to call them names a lot of the times we know why they are even going through it more than they themselves know it we have reason for everything [Music] we seem to know why everybody is going through what they are going through if there was any time we should just get prepared and get ready and seek the face of god and be in our prayer mode it is now praise be to god i will restore i will restore save the lord when the storms come the tree is not happy when the storm is blowing and you hear the sound of the leaves we don't know what the tree is saying but it could be crying and shouting lord have mercy of me forgive me help me if you save my life i'll be a better child that's what they may be saying but after that storm is passed and then the root just balances itself and then it starts gapping the soil and then it stands up again next time the same storm comes the tree is standing that is when the tree begins to appreciate what the lord has done when a storm comes your way and you go through that storm your life is never the same you may never realize it but your life is never the same next time the same storm comes it doesn't even move you it will take a bigger storm to kind of shake you a little and then again you get grounded and before you aware you get to a place and you wonder how did i get here it's just the grace of god it's not what you have been able to do there is nothing you can do is what he has done we are depending on his finished works it is not what you can do what can amend you absolutely nothing we are depending on his finished works praise be to god at every time we open up our house and let the holy spirit come into us it shakes the roots loose so that we can grow down and get a better hold on christ jesus praise be to god i'm called on the rock that cannot fail grounded safe at last in the savior's love we the church knees today now what the church needs today is opening up and get green don't try to be um i i am a doctor phd my pastor is what what what um what does that mean anyhow did you say in the bible deity means dumb dog and i cannot think it's changed very much since then that's right brother we don't need dds we need a holy ghost experience in the church of the living god you know that's true we need to be greened up living up if life makes you add green then go ahead and get life that's right the lifeline hasn't been cut the caterpillars hasn't been eaten oh brother one of these days god is going to come down with his great insect power a powder he is going to spray that all stump praise be to god that is the good thing every good farmer would not put a seed in the soil and just let the seed take care of itself no god would not plant you here and let you take care of yourself the love that a farmer has for his crops it's a farmer loves their crops yes i used to go to the farm and i just love walking through the farm and just get down and then just take the plant by the leaves and just admire them farmers love their crops and the love that a farmer has for his crops god has a thousand times love for you than that type of love and when the insects attack the crops the farmer doesn't sit down no that's what the prophet is talking about now god will get the insect powder because naturally the farmer just goes and gets some chemicals and then he'll come and spray the animals and make sure he kills them so they don't disturb his crops his eyes are upon the cross every stage the crop goes through the farmer's eyes are upon the crops when the weed is trying to overtake the crops he comes and he takes the wheels away when there is insect infestation he comes and he kills the insects every stage of their growth his eyes are upon the crops and he loves them but when a farmer plants a corn he's not planting the corn because he wants the leaves but he is happy when he sees the leaves looking so green and fresh and when the flower he gets happier but he has nothing to do with the flowers and when you see the crops coming oh there is more joy but that is not what is waiting he is looking for the seed and when they begin to tussle they are beginning to bear the fruits and he see the seas oh praise be to god then it's all joy so from planting the seed to harvest the farmer's eyes are upon the crops every single moment and the lord's eyes are upon his children every single moment whatever it is that you are going through the lost eyes are upon you you might think that you are alone you have never been alone you have never been alone and you will never be alone every single step you take the eyes of the lord are upon you he has made us a promise god is not slack concerning his promise as some man counts likeness but he is not suffering towards us that he may bring us onto an expected end whatever promise he has made he will keep his promise praise be to god sometimes you get in the midst of the storm and you think that god has forgotten you that is when god is closest like a song i love to talk about almost every time but i almost almost every time i forget of the title also praise be to god amen i've forgotten again but this is the story that oh one step one is one step at a time i'm not sure but there was this according to the song that every time he took a step he saw another set of footprints yes another set of footprints whatever it was and then he knew that god was with him because he was seeing his footprints he was seeing the other set of footprints and then when she got to the thickest moment of his life when everything seemed to have gone wrong and he was expecting to see those set of footprints he wasn't seeing them anymore he was only seeing one set of footprints and then he complained to the lord why have you done this to me every time i took a step i could see my footprints and i could see your footprints and i knew you were with me but when i got to the thickest moment of my life the roughest part of my life when i was so trusted to see your footprints i wasn't seeing you anymore it was just one set of footprints and the lord said that was when i was carrying you praise be to god and that those set of footprints you were seeing they were not yours they were mine praise be to god amen so when you get to the roughest part and you think you are alone you think you are just by yourself you think god has forgotten of you that is when god has you in his loving arms praise be to god the eyes of god are upon his children every step you take god is interested in it praise be to god he comes with the powder spray because he will not allow the animals the worms to eat down the crop and then he comes and he sprays them and she's going to grow just as sure as the world she is going to do it yes say and god will restore all the years that the locusts and the caterpillars eat up now on the day of pentecost they had they had they had 120 brand new sheepskin bottles that's right not gold skin but sheepskin it makes the best yes sir and 120 green bottles was set in the upper room praise god plenty of stretching and growing pains they had their house open to catch everything god would pour down yes sir today we say i will go over there but i will not tell you what i don't believe i don't care how much he brings it out of the bible i will never believe it well you all cowhide guskin what's the matter anyhow praise be to god we are serving a wonderful god we thank god for the prophet of god he lays it down anyhow you can choose to believe it or not doesn't come to say something to please you of course he will not come to see something because he wants to get on your necks but just push the word away where it belongs praise god wonderful all we like sheep had gone astray it took one month sin one man going of course going against the word of god to plunge the whole humanity into sin in sin did my mother conceive me in iniquity was i shaping come to the world speaking life you don't have to tell the first lie to be a sinner you don't have to steal the first meat from the soup from the pot of soup to be a sinner the reason why you do those things is because you are born into it and then you come into this life and satan has so much control over your life every man every woman had drifted away from the word of god because of one man's sin but remember we have a promise god will always remember his own and that which the counterwomen the caterpillar has destroyed he is going to he's going to restore and everything everything the devil has stolen the devil is a chief he careful to steal to kill and to destroy everything the devil has told him is going to be restored whether it is of of of your experience with god whether whether it is of your health whether it is of your joy in christ whether it is whatever whatever it is that the devil has stolen we have a promise from god i will restore and nothing can stop it as god said and has not delivered has he made a promise and has not kept his promise all power in heaven and on earth belongs to him the word of god is true the bible says let every man's word be a lie but my word be the truth there is only one truth and that is the word of god whatever god has promised he will do he is going to do it to the letter there are not enough demons in hell that can stop the move of god praise be to god whatever he has promised god is obligated to his word amen whatever promise he has said he is obligated to it he is not a liar god will bring his word to pass whether rain or shine praise be to god i will restore say the lord said yes you may have wandered away from the path of righteousness you may have gone astray but we have a promise i will restore don't look at you because there is nothing good in you to look at amen keep your focus on god let your hope and confidence be in the word of god and this is thus says the lord and the power of god said that said the lord does not fail praise be to god keep your focus on god that is how you see god manifesting himself in your life don't be a double standard person a double standard person cannot receive anything from god let your faith be anchored in the world it doesn't matter what you are going through it doesn't matter how far you have drifted away from the word of god it still does not change the promise of god towards you today you might be afraid of god's son who was waiting for his father to die so he would inherit his the wife of his father and the father was living too long and he grew so impatient went to the father and asked for his inheritance the father did not deny him the father gave it to him and we know the story how he went and he blasted everything and he ended up sleeping in pigpens struggling with pigs for their food i don't think the pigs were happy eating their pig's food stabbing them but it got to a point he couldn't handle it anymore he couldn't handle it he said you know instead of just staying here and struggling with these pigs for their food let me go back home my father is a king look i don't have to go back and be a son i'm ready and i'll be happy to be a servant in my father's house and unknown to him the father was always looking in the direction knowing that one day his son is going to come back i will restore [Music] i will restore say the lord all the years that the palmer went the counterweight the caterpillar has destroyed i will stop him and then he got up one day just started going he didn't care what was going to happen oh to his surprise he sees his father in the outskirts just they just threw harms around each other oh daddy i'm sorry i'm sorry daddy said you don't have nothing to be sorry about i don't deserve to be a son anymore i just want to be a servant the father says you know what there is no place for you in my home as a servant i am carrying you home anyhow you are still going to be a son praise be to god all the years that the counterworm has destroyed they are going to be restored all the years that caterpillar has destroyed they are going to be restored all the years the power have destroyed they are going to be restored you are not going to be a servant in your father's home you are going to be a son with authority praise be to god you may be that prodigal son here this morning you might be that woman that was caught in adultery and she knew the punishment in advance she knew that it was over and here they bring hair before the lord jesus christ we cut this woman in the right on and they were holding their stones they were ready to break his cow and then the lord jesus looks at them he said let he that is without sin be the first to cast the stone at that point this woman knew it was over because these are the people that are walking the streets of israel in their long ropes very holy they would have been step on an ant very sanctimonious that people see them and they bow down they're sitting in public places they occupy the bases and this woman knows that oh this is a holy man so when the lord jesus said let he does if he doesn't cut the first stone she knew it was over she was just lying down and waiting for the first stone there was nothing coming in any case it takes two to commit a crime where was the man where was the man how is it that you're just coming with only the woman where is the man who knows maybe he was one of them then the lord jesus started writing in the sand i don't know maybe he was the first one who went close to see what he was writing and then he saw his name you are the first to die before this woman he said oh i'm out of here he trolled down the stone started going they were asking where are you going he said he couldn't even open his mouth to talk the next person comes he looks you are unaccomplished you know who committed a crime with her you have to die and they're off they go till they're all left and then the woman the lord left his head the woman was expecting to die she had got to her wits ends she had given up on life she knows it was completely done but remember we have a promise i will restore save the lord and the lord prophesied over her life go and say no more go and sin no more whatever condition you find yourself in whatever you have to deal with it doesn't matter if all the odds in this life are against you know that you are a child of god god does not make mistakes and god has not saved you only to lose you the good where god has started in you he will bring you to a completion praise be to god nothing can stop it don't think that god is teasing you like sometimes with these children you bring the i don't know maybe some sweets and they are lying down you bring it so close and then they want to grab it and then they are shouting and then you are dodging it no god is not like that god brings it so close because he wants to give it praise be to god praise be to god you might be assumption today we all know the story of something you may be at something today diving cut and you are in the enemy's camp with his eyes plucked out and he knew had to tell him that this is over praise be to god i don't know about you but i have been there before when i knew that it was done that there was no coming back i knew but the eyes of god are upon his children the grace of god a lot of the times we try to explain the grace of god but then you realize that you don't even scratch the surface of it it is so deep and so wide you can't understand the grace of god you can't understand what the grace of god would do in the life of a man or a woman praise be to god grace my goodness if it hadn't been for the grace of god we will not be seated here for by grace are we saved through faith not of ways it is not your strength that has brought you this far it is not your wisdom it's not your intellect it's not your education that has brought you this far it is the grace of god it is the grace of god a favor a favor no man deserves praise be to god now when you make it tomorrow and you get there you know that it's not your effort you know it is the grace of god can you imagine that if on the cross when we gathered that day and then you asked that that that thief on the cross jesus so today you build me in paradise and you ask him how did you make it praise be to god what are you going to hear what are you going to hear the answer you hear is i don't know i don't know how i made it but one thing i do know that the lord jesus gave his all for me he died so i would live that i made it by grace i made it by grace and something's eyes plucked out and he knew where i am now i'm in the enemy's camp they have bound me there is nothing i can do they just stay here and die and all the people knew about something well something's just come and then behave like a clown and they would laugh and laugh and laugh both young and old and then they hide their fists now all the people gathered together from the king to his servant and they are ready to laugh again but something prayed and asked god one more time lord one more time to strengthen him one more time all that the palmer won the conquer worm the caterpillar the locusts have eaten i will restore says the lord his dignity was gone they used to mention something's name and people will be cooking and they'll be jumping over the pot that man is coming again people will leave their homes they will enter behind the door and barricade themselves why because something is coming that name that used to bring terror on people had now become a laughingstock that meant people who see come and run away now they see him there and they rather get close to make fun of the bible says our store his hair was growing but the people's eyes were blended to it he could feel his hair growing and yet there are people around him with ice they couldn't see the hair coming and he knew praise be to god that the lord is doing something and on that day when they had got it again to make fun it was the biggest funeral they ever had you may be at something today whoever whatever condition you find yourselves in remember who you are that you are a child of god you are not just anybody you are not just anybody know who you are and learn to take authority wherever you find yourself if there is something going on you don't like you can talk to god and he will change it i remember one time at work that was when i went to my new place today i was cutting a i was opening a bag and uh how did i call it a piece of a piece of paper went into every machine that was my first time and i didn't know what that was going to do and you know what a lot of the times we think that when you have that special time to go before god that is when god answers your prayer no that is good that is good but you know what a lot of the times when you don't even expect god to answer that is when he moves that is when he moves that has amazed me over and over i can't get over it god moves when you are not respecting him and i just said a very simple prayer it was not quite five minutes and there was a blackout in the whole building this is a very big place we are over a thousand people in that building it is four floors there was a total blackout everything went dead and then i went down i met one guy he said i've been here for seven years i've never seen anything like this happen and the way it happened everything we had in the mesa we had to dump it and i have seen god move in very mysterious ways you can take authority the authority is given to you it depends on whether you want to use it or not but you have it don't look mean upon yourself can you imagine you sitting down with an ak-47 fully loaded and then you allow some filthy demon to come around you with a whip it's whipping you and you're lying you're crying god i need your help and you're holding ak-47 is that a situation we find ourselves in most of the times we are children of god with authority you can take control over every situation it is not you it's not you it's good if you want to put in a prayer request it's good if you want to ask somebody to help you in prayer but if you are faced with any situation no but i ran said prayer can change any situation not some situations but any situation prayer can change any situation i remember when my wife was pregnant with dany she had a dream that somebody came in the dream to take the baby away from her that was when she was that was fine even before danny was born and then she struggled with him in the dream so when i woke up not that she woke me up so when i woke up she told me the dream and i said in that was in those days 20-something years if it's today i wouldn't even worry because the devil takes people's faces and if you want to fool that in your dream that would not be a good story but what i did then i'm not saying it's a good thing i said whose face did you see she said no i didn't see anybody's face no i said she said she saw somebody's face but it was a strange face then i don't know what came over me and i mentioned somebody and she said yes that was the face you saw then we prayed lo and behold before five am that morning the woman left the house and she never came back she left the house and she never came back when we pray something happens when you pray something happens anything that you have placed before the lord believe that god has already granted it whatever your heart desires are place them before the lord and believe believe to them that belief all things are possible believe that god has already answered that prayer the devil will give you a thousand reasons why god has not answered that prayer but keep holding on to that one reason you know praise be to god wonderful to them that belief all things are possible he created the world from nothing i'm closing now the musicians can come over he created the world from nothing from nothing we are serving a creator a creator they created the world from nothing and can you imagine if he has your life in a sense to work with can you imagine what the lord would do if you completely completely totally surrender your life to him and do not hold back a lot of the times we just give him a part of our lives and there is a part that is so dear to us we want to keep holding on and that part is killing us but we still keep holding on till when till when let the lord take complete control let him take complete control let him take over the steering wheel just be the passenger you ought to be and let him drive you to safety you may not know which direction he is going but when you know the lord is behind the steering wheel that is enough [Music] that is enough consolation to know that the lord is in the seat that he is in charge that he is in control praise be to god [Music] there was just something my brother once told me to get ready for service today i was torn between two [Music] but just a little bit of something just came from what i was looking at that when you see a pilot in the air when you see a pilot in the air the pilot is in charge of the plane [Music] because the airline has employed him and has given him charge over the plane so he is in charge of the plane but the pilot is not in charge of the flight [Music] he is not in charge of the flight [Music] when you see him in the skies [Music] there are people somewhere in the control tower they are telling him stay here don't go up don't go down you are 20 000 feet stay there and sometimes i will tell him they'll tell the control tower i want to go up they'll say nope you're not going up stay right there [Music] then when they are ready to say okay you know what go up to 30 000 feet and stay there don't move there are forces that are in operation he is not in charge of the flight you may say my life is my life i can do anything i want no you can't do anything you want there is somebody that is in charge you go where he wants you to go [Music] you do what he wants you to do when the pilot refused to listen to the control tower and then he changes his his his flight and decides to do anything in the air guess what there is going to be confusion you can be moving across another airline you're crashing the air because if god terrorists will get back to this very topic i don't know why this just came you know it's under a different thing altogether i don't know why it just came in but i will not keep it i'll just give it out praise be to god but if it's the will of god one day then we are going to talk about it but remember that you are not in charge when you feel you are in charge then god is not in charge when you get to the place to think that you are in charge then god is not in charge [Music] praise be to god i will restore say the lord remember in closing god would not force himself god will not force himself upon any man [Music] god is a gentleman the holy spirit would not force himself upon any man [Music] we are free moral agencies but god wants you to willingly surrender unto him that when the holy ghost comes it is the holy ghost who does the restoration the holy ghost would bring you to the fullness of the word of god not halfway the holy ghost would restore you to the purity of the word the holy ghost would restore you to your true identity as a child of god we hear of identity theft identity theft identity theft didn't start now identity step the devil started identity theft that he stole our identity that we didn't know who we were we thought we were the man after this flesh and everything this first tells us to do we do it but the holy ghost would restore you to your true identity as a child of god he's the holy ghost who does the restoration and the bible the scripture we just read [Music] can we i just jumped over something but if we can turn our bibles to look at us we are seated [Music] yes i thought i could see [Music] [Music] so luke 24 49 [Music] look 24 49 [Music] and behold i send the promise [Music] the lord jesus speaking behold i send the promise of my father upon you bacteria in the city of jerusalem until you are endured with power and authority and what is the promise of the father what is the promise of the father [Music] that i will restore i will restore all the years the cankerworm the palmer women whatever i have destroyed [Music] and he also promised it doesn't end there is going to give us the holy spirit the holy ghost [Music] the holy ghost is something a person that we ought to have in our lives for without the holy ghost the prophet says somehow you are not even a christian to believe what [Music] we need the holy ghost to be restored to the fullness to the fullness of the word we need the holy ghost [Music] for the restoration comes from the from from the holy ghost without the holy ghost there is no restoration [Music] without the holy ghost there is no restoration it's not you forcing yourselves talk to god and remind god of his promises towards you it's a promise he has made and brother brown said god is willing more willing to give us the holy ghost then we are willing to receive you don't think god will deny you [Music] if you have not received the holy ghost it is not god's fault set your life praise be to god shall we go to the lord in prayer yes brother hillary here [Music] shall we pray i want us to go before the lord [Music] i don't know in whatever way god has spoken to you but we have a promise that the word of god will not go out and return unto him void talk to god in whatever way god has spoken to you i just want you to open your mouth and talk to god i don't know what your heart desires are i don't know what you had on your heart coming to check this morning and obviously you didn't come to hear a man you kept trusting and believing that god will talk to you and if god has addressed something in your life this is the time to speak to god talk to god our lord and our savior jesus we thank you so much oh god for your word of life that has
