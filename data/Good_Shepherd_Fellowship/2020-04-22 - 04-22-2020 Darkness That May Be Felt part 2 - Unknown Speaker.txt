thank you Jesus pray amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord thinking system now it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight I want to read a [Music] I would start from reading reading the quote and that just one I sent out there tonight and and uh whom I referred to different ones but this is the one that I want to read Jesus Christ the same yesterday and uh just like we prayed and agreed each and every one of you out there and in the name of the Lord Jesus it's good to be in the house of the Lord today as our dear brother and sister attorney at home over you know is just like when David was going to bring the ark over you know back to his resting place from the from the Philistines and and he tried to provide a way to bring it and it did not work we decided to kept I mean keep it over in the home of a dear man and his wife and and I mean the Lord blessed him for that so we pray that the Lord will remember everybody Jordan and his wife and I was thinking about that today and uh that's that was one of the things that happened to her or suggest have this little time to pray them and remember you know all these different ones that are out there and just like I said uh we are all you know uh to our homes and different things but there are there are people you know doctors nurses and people in the science lab you know that are spending countless hours you know making research and trying to find you know a solution to this problem and uh I mean some of them we will we will never know but you know just like brother Branham said in the message adoption you know he says there's a place in heaven for the good doctor and I believe that all of these people that are making research you know and and everything I know there are a lot of things you know uh people report on the internet about uh you know the vaccine and you know and different things well I mean some people will believe it and uh you know and and some people it will affect them it will make them afraid but I believe as children of God you know if you believe that the son of righteousness has risen upon us with healing in his wings you know when the scripture says healing in his wings so God have different way to bring healing you know it's not just one win is healing in his wings you know he can heal by medical doctor by science also and Jesus said you know he said uh in sin Luke chapter 16 that's not a reading of the word but I just want to read this uh I'm jumping ahead of myself a little bit but that's okay he said uh it's in Luke chapter 16 verse 8 he says and the Lord commanded the unjust steward because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light praise the Lord this is Jesus own word the children of this word are in dear generation wiser than the children of light I just wanted to read that why I refer to this quote that we want to read now before we go into what we want to talk about tonight bird Brenham uh Christ Jesus Christ the same yesterday he said one day say for instance the electric light there was a time when a man who taught that if they did have told somebody 500 years ago that they did have an electric light like that the person who have said this person was crazy but there was a man one time who down in his heart believe that there was he believed that there was electric light when he looked at the sunshine he looked at the the few or the kerosene provide light in the lantern that they were using those days he just believed you know with the different things he was seeing there was something that told him that there was a brighter light you know they were so bright to life and uh down in his heart he believed that there was that he could catch that electricity and he got a kite and a key and he fished it out of the scar and it runs down the stream and hit into the bottle and it's and and he stopped it up and he began to stream I got it I got it he had it but he didn't know what he had just remind me you know uh during the warning and uh that was around 1994 I can still remember uh uh it was uh no 1995 uh 94 I came to the Ivory Coast and then I spent a couple of months there I went back for uh the brothers there for us to move over so that was that was 1995 that was around February so we came and uh and and now remember now we were we were at a place where we you know there was no electricity you know I mean uh every every I mean all the infrastructure was destroyed there was no running water there was no electricity so uh when we came we got to the Ivory Coast in the evening it was it was night when uh when our bus got over there so when we came in the town there was there was a there was a family the brother is there we brought a toxin now and uh Brother Sam and the sister has gone to be with the Lord their little son uh Eric he's a big boy now and he looked at the street light and he says he says he says mama mama look at the fire you know he was born right in the time of the war I've never seen a street light never seen a ball of light hanging in the middle of the road you know and I I still remember that like yesterday you know his trained he says he says mama mama you know I mean he caught everybody attention he says look at the fire yeah that was the first time he saw he saw light you know and uh and and his life would never be the same again you know because there was constant electricity in in agriculture you know uh so I mean uh I mean if you tell Eric that now he will struggle in his mind to even remember that you know yeah he will actually struggled in his mind so brother Brandon saying here you know uh Benjamin Franklin from that from that uh uh experiment that he did with the cart and the kid and and what he felt you know uh the pulling of the car the current he fell you know uh uh uh something in him you know told him that you know uh that there was there was there was electricity out there and and he started streaming you know I got it I got it he says and brother Branham said he had it but he didn't know what he had he says and that's that's what he says and and uh that's what the church that's the matter with the church today they have got something but amen he says but they don't know what they got praise the Lord if we just only know that this word that we are hindering is internal life praise the Lord if we only know that this word that we are hindering that what we have in our hands you know just like Moses you know God said what do you have in your hand he said it was a stake if you only knew that that was the thing he was going to stretch to open the rare seed and that was the thing he was going to use to stand before pharaoh and and that's the matter with the church we have got something but don't know what we got now as long as he had it he could rejoice I know it's year I feed it I know I got it it's it's in here but what but what did he have he he didn't do nothing with it well then Thomas Edison come along after after Benjamin Franklin and a long come Thomas and said that he could make a light there was something now you see because Benjamin has caught it you know he has realized it that thing that was dwelling in The Invisible has touched him of Flesh and because he did not know what it was because he had touched the sword it was a seed that has gone through the soil now because that seed has gone to the human soil there will be somebody else that will come up and pick up from right there for it for their sea to come to life praise the Lord so Thomas come along and and he could make light there was something in him that told him that he could make light and help mankind now you you think about it now think about it when when when when Benjamin Franklin was thinking about this what actually he was thinking about is that uh I mean you go down the street during that time and you you could just see every house I mean you could count how many lanterns that were in the house you know if they had their window open you know you go down the street you could count how many houses using lamb turning and but now he's thinking now if if I can realize this you just think about it if I can realize this I mean uh uh they would not have to have two three lamps in the kitchen one bright light would just shine because what was he drawing his inspiration from the Sun he was seen drawing his inspiration to see how when the sun comes up it brightens you know every every word sheer the same light of the Sun so in his mind I mean there is there is something that is there if he can be now he's thinking about this to be able to help Humanity and brother Branham said in a spoken word is the Original Seed he said anything that will help mankind is from God anything that will help mankind is from God David said in the psalm he says he says uh bless the Lord for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men praise the Lord so yeah brother Branham says he says uh uh uh there there is something in him that told him that he could make he could make it he could make light and help mankind and so he sat at his decks for for tens of thousands of wire he said he tried to make it uh that electric uh occurring flow through the wire he on and on and on tireless hour and nights were the whole world many people in the world were sleeping many people they were so content with the alarm I mean there were new start of lamb that was coming uh people had all I remember those days we used to put oil in a little little cup you know the the Tomato carb we put oil with rocks and just put a little uh you know cut my James paints and just drop it there and you know that was steady light you know uh I mean you you just think about it you know uh like brother Branham says it takes desperation to bring sometimes things out of men you know when when men are faced with crisis like this we become creative praise the Lord amen I mean see how many people you know uh uh bless you have been sitting there even since now me facing Max and all of that you never thought you could do it but when when the knee comes there is that thing of almighty God in us that is able to bring out the best amen it's a tense and in thousands of why he tried the electric current to flow through the wire and on and on tireless hour night and people calling him crazy you know this guy just lock up in the room and I mean you go around him there's just different wires connecting this that people don't know what is it there is just something in his heart realizing that he's able to achieve this thing and when he hit it it will be a blessing to mankind and I I you know I just think about that how many doctors scientists even right here in Minnesota you know at the U of M Mayo Clinic around the world people looking for answers always can be so easy as a Believer to say Jesus is the answer but bring your Jesus to flesh you know the word is just like that little boy in the room as if Mama says you know Jesus is with you son he says mama I want Jesus with skin on praise the Lord not only Jesus with a word but Jesus with skin on praise the Lord tireless I was night and people calling him crazy and everything but there is something on the inside of him told him that that electric wood light something told him that those cross wire will Spike current will flow the light will shine and as long as there is something in the inside telling you that it will do it there is bound to be something there to respond to that God will not give you a desire you know I was just thinking about this today then and this is Wednesday anyway uh uh you know we can do a prayer meeting and and but uh just before I go to the word I was thinking about this I was just in the backyard and thinking about this thing about the the the lender and and the borrower you know you can you can apply that scripture in many different ways and what was coming to my mind is the other you know uh there are people you know that God just blessed with with a heart they want to Shield every little thing they have they want to share now uh you know every form of giving in one sense you are Lending even though you are not doing it with a mind expecting to get a return but but it's under God's Lord amen is honor a law of God that when you give you will receive so every time you give a helping hand you are Lending and when a person is also on the other side that also want to be the the the to be be on the receiving end every time they just want to be on the receiving end and uh I mean you you have put yourself on a on the the the natural law of a burial because you always want to receive praise the Lord because is the law that gives you know he's he is the giver he's the one that provide a promise to to provide all of our needs he said he have a ten thousand cattles on the hill praise the Lord so you see as he gives us life and he gave us breath we hold our life back to him because in their sense he's the lender the life that we have is not our own we are just borrowing so we owe him our life so it's not only in the sense of money it's not only in the sense of natural thing but it can be applied in many different ways so you'll find that what what I mean what makes the the the the early fathers what principle that make this country a blessed country I mean the principle of charity and and that principle of Charity is from where it's from giving because as much as we we give and help the ones that are in need in one sense we put ourselves under the law of the lender praise the Lord not actually expecting to get something back from that person but because you are honor the lord of the lender there is a promise because when the Deep color to the Deep there is a deep also to respond so God will in turn bless you like Jesus said it he says well what what is the blessing if you just do to them that you know them that you know in them that you love he says anybody would do that says as long as there is something on the inside telling you that it will be door he says there's bound to be something there to respond a deep calling to the deal as I have said often before the fan was on the Fishback there's a water first for him to swim all he wouldn't have had that thing if there is a deep in your calling there's God to be a deep to respawn praise the Lord so let's just uh take a portion of the word and read tonight second Corinthians chapter 4. second Corinthians chapter 4 I'm staying trying to stay on our subject of Darkness that could be failed second Corinthians chapter four I just want to let's read from verse 3 but if our gospel behead it is hey to them that are lost in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe next the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine upon them for we preach not ourself but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servant for Jesus sake now watch this now for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness have shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ let's pray father bless this little portion of your word in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed look at the scripture again for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness have shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ now remember now we had we had a little uh Bible studies to do personal Bible studies I I would love to see what uh what you what you you saw on that I mean studying that scripture the darkness upon the face of the deep now Paul is also taking the same thing year he says and uh to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ praise the Lord now so he's comparing Genesis chapter 1. he's comparing Genesis chapter one the same way God said let there be light he called for the light praise the Lord the Bible says Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God move upon the face of the water now the scripture places in a way that Darkness was first present before God called for the light praise the Lord so here Paul now is is comparing what happened there in Genesis chapter 1 that is the same thing that God did to us being born is seen shiplet in iniquity come to the word speaking lies in some way we were covered with Darkness there was a dark there was a darkness that was Upon Our deep praise the Lord I'm hoping that the Lord will help us because we I want us to to to just study along this line a little bit to be able to see because just like I said there are many people you think about it think about let me let me grab your attention here realize that Darkness was upon Egypt the people that could not even see their face they stretched their hands they couldn't see their hands there was light over here in Goshen and uh but right in Goshen was a missed multitude right in Goshen those people that were sitting under the light or the pillow of fire will be people that would trouble Moses for 40 years in the wilderness so they were sitting on a light but there was still darkness in their heart there were darkness in their mind they were sitting under the light they could see there is Darkness there in Egypt there is lighter what brought the light it was Moses message that brought the light it was a message that Moses preached in Egypt that brought the light they are sitting under the light they are traveling they're seeing the Egyptians coming the scene I mean they can see the dust in the air they look behind them because of the darkness they can't even see the terror but they can hear the sound of the terror they see the presence of God the pillar of fire is leading them by nine the pillow of cloud by day and all of these things but yet this will be the very same people that will complain they will murmur this would be the very same people why was that is because why in the presence of the light they stay hard their mind close they close the windows of their mind they close the doors of their heart the presence of the light that they were enjoying on the outside was not affecting them in the inside praise the Lord for God who commanded light to shine out of Darkness has shine in our heart praise the Lord amen I can just imagine in my mind Benjamin Franklin when he wakes up in the night or in the morning he opened his curtain and he looked outside his dark side to settings wait he keeps waiting to be able to see when the sun comes out how the darkness will just go away and he thinks about why why there is something more brighter than a candlestick there is something more brighter than a lamb you realize that in the day when the Sun is up to open the curtain in the house is brighter in the night when the darkness come they might have 12 candle lines but still the light is not enough believe we can have brighter light at the same way it's outside we can be able to experience brighter light inside now we have LEDs praise the Lord and those gentlemen working at the church they say they're going to give us LED lights hope they don't blind our eyes [Laughter] but he said it's going to be brighter than what we have we're talking about light here you know how more light comes it gets more brighter because it keeps out the darkness John chapter 1. it's in John chapter 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God praise the Lord all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made praise the Lord now you see because we have traveled by grace and we have got teachers Through the Ages for the apostles and all the reformers and and and and in this age a brother brand of ministry has enlightened our mind with the the the True Light Of God when we read this scripture all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made you I mean you asked even some of the the kids in church they will tell you who was this hymn the scripture was talking about they would say well it was God they would say well I mean that was Jesus but follow me here a little bit just follow me in a little bit as we read this scripture together in him was life and the life was the light of men wherever John is testifying about he's testifying about that one that was in the beginning he's testifying about the one that called light out of Darkness that said let there be light and there was light is the one that he's talking about and as we travel down a little bit we realize here he said in the 14th verse and the Word was May flesh endured Among Us now so we realize here that uh uh the word let me say it like this so it will make sense to you their flesh done and it will never becomes the word amen the flesh is not the word the flesh will never becomes the word but the word will be made flesh praise the Lord so in one sense what John was testifying here about when he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God now remember he keep making emphasis on the word on the word on the word and it was that word that came and took on flesh and we call it Jesus Christ he says all things were made by him amen Jesus in a Christ in a pre-figure form all things was not made by Jesus Christ that was born of the Virgin but all things was made by the word their flesh will never become the word when when we try to be a a bit smart and things that you know uh we can we can grab the the trinitarian year and and we start to interpret the scripture immediately and say this is Jesus Christ you are completely out what you're doing here is that you are making the flesh the word is the word that become flesh is the word that takes on flesh the same word that takes on the Flesh of Abraham was the same word that take on the Flesh of the Patriot because God spoke about them for after 400 years he says I will come down and with a mighty hand I will bring them out that word become flesh in the life of Moses just like he speaks about the bride behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the Great and the Dreadful Bay in the day of the voice of the seven angels that word become flesh a pick on a flesh of a Kentucky man but the flesh will never be the word are we together the flesh will never be the word so the same word that created all things was the same word that took that body like brother Brandon would say when he came down to Abraham he just took out a dust and he breathe it breathe and he and he dwared in it the word took on flesh and uh in first John John would testify he says when the world took on flesh we behold his glory as the glory of the only begotten what was he talking about the word took on flesh and we when we started seeing the thing that the flesh was doing the word in flesh was doing we behold his glory and truly we believe that this was the son of God praise the Lord follow my thought here now God Paul says that call light out of Darkness shine in our heart what why did he shine in our heart to be able to push out the darkness to be able to push out every Darkness because brother Branham said that God started watching over us just like he did to Abraham he promised Abraham in Genesis chapter 15 and and and uh he says after 400 years brother Branham says that kind of for lay out four generations and lay our fourth generation and that is the reason why uh uh uh when when when uh when uh when Matthew said it met Abraham and said communion to Abraham he paid Abraham paid tithe to him why Abraham was looking down after four generation of a priesthood that would come in oven it has to go from from Isaac to Jacob praise the Lord from Isaac to Jacob and over to the patriarch and then after it was out of Levi the the the priest who came so it was four generation so now all through the time of this fourth generation just like he did to Abraham is the same that he did to you and and he thought about you from the foundation of the world but at the time that your great great great fourth generation before you got here that lineage that bloodline that you were coming through when that parent was here on the earth there was something that caught his attention because he could see through the bloodline and see that he had promised for this age a Son of God that will be born a daughter of God someone that would believe his promise and stand for him in this thing but then see see the uh uh uh what we came through some of us came from parents that were that were drunk some of us came from parents that were other worship all of those Darkness all of those things I I make up the cells of our body they make up the way we behaved and the things that we suffer live and the things that trouble all of those things Darkness but right in there right in there there was a seed in the Earth Barbarian says spoken word is the Original Seed say you realize God did not planted any seed because the sea was already in the earth what he needed to do was just to call them photo life and that is the same thing that he's doing to you and myself praise the Lord sometimes we get caught up in a habit where we get so troubled about habits that uh I mean we find ourselves and we don't like it about ourselves what makes you don't like said anything about yourself is because in you it's a seed of God and that thing that you don't like about yourself you just borrow it it ran down through your genetics and that's the reason why that word that you continue to receive is shining forth in you to call you out of that Darkness the same God will call light out of Darkness has shine in our hearts he has shine in our heart the knowledge of God in the face of Jesus Christ that's what Paul's saying praise the Lord there's a man here that can turn on the light amen the word is going through a dark period in uh in many ways this darkness is affecting people praise the Lord and even being the child of God sometimes we get you know fear across our mind when we think about different ones and we think about different situations but there's a man that can turn on the light amen praise the Lord there's a man that can turn on the light and uh just like I said I want to I want to kind of for doors on this uh on this subject a little bit believing that that God will be able to help us as we go along let's look at collusion chapter one I have another another type here if you think about it Benjamin Franklin says I got it I mean he saw it but there were Shadows Of Shadows Of Shadows of what the reality was brother Branham says he got it but he did not know what he got right praise the Lord he got it he could feed it that yeah it's real this thing is it's it's moving my hands but it was shadow shadow shadow shadow away praise the Lord and that is the same thing with the believer internal life we got it Jesus said he that believeth in me is passed from Death unto life we already gathered in this body but see the different things that we go through it will be a mistake like it was in the ages there was a man that was preaching preaching the gospel on based on that scripture you know uh that you know Christians will never die you know uh I mean uh and then whenever there was there was a follower that died he would make some excuse you know and give the people their skills until when the teacher of the of you know of the doctrine died then then the doctrine had to die then the people realized that it was a false teaching because every promise of God every promise that God has given us is right in our hands we get it that is the reason why Faith becomes a very strong substance to the believer Faith bring the promises so close doubt and fear will take it the young shadows and shadows and shadows praise the Lord Collision chapter 1 Paul says here in uh verse 13. verse 12 giving thanks unto the Father which have which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light so there is an inheritance of the sins in life we get to death but watch what he says who have delivered us from the power of Darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin now so he telling us here just like he said to the Corinthians the god that God lied out of darkness is the same God that has shown for lie down in our heart but what is it you know he says he have delivered us from the power of Darkness so there is a power in darkness and it can be felt the power of Darkness can be felt praise the Lord and many that don't have this hope that we have feeling it in one way or the other and even some that have come in the presence of light came in the presence of Truth what is this Kingdom of the deer of his dear son it's a kingdom of light is just like Goshen in Egypt right praise the Lord because every Kingdom has a power if you don't have the power it would not be a kingdom amen it will not be a country I mean it has their constitution he has their power you know that govern that govern it so we realize here that uh uh Paul is making us to know there is an inheritance of the sins in light that God has brought us to an inheritance of the sins in life and things that we can we can benefit from things that we can enjoy being in This Promise being in this Kingdom of his dear son in this Kingdom of Light which what is the Kingdom Under the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just believing the message of the hour I mean it's it's kind of a scary when we were playing the tape on demonology I mean brother Brandon made some very very strong statements you know very very strong statement he made you know and he was talking about uh you know uh uh demon powers in the church you know you think about it what what uh what did that wish of end or her to bring up the spirit of the holy man she was now calling uh uh uh uh saw Up In The Name Of The Lord she was chanting whatever she could chant there is a power but even at that time before the resurrection of Jesus Christ he had an influence or the life of a Believer because Saul was one a power of Darkness I mean I'm saying all of this to bring us to the place there I mean just just coming through the church door is not enough and and sometimes you sit back and and you just see people you know you see people and and it's it's just almost like they are not giving into the world you ask yourself are they really grabbing where you are going with what you are talking about are they really seeing what I mean the the word that has been delivered what you actually you talking about because the thing about it there is that many has been around uh a preaching of the Gospel you know that make you special because you are in the message and people in the denomination they are devil they are going to hell so you just get this warm feeling because now you're in the message so you think that I mean you are okay but until this light shines right in there in your heart and it's able to push every Darkness away push every fear every doubt and and that's the thing that would bring your body in suggestion to this truth just ahead knowledge is not enough he has delivered us from the power of Darkness and he has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son that happens that's their experience we go through by the baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah that's what that's what the believer goes through he's been cut away now you think about this Abraham he was just just a farmer just I mean uh uh sheep header and when lot was taken and the king of Sodom was taken away now these were two Nations that uh that were fighting against one another and one nation conquered another Nation but yet Abraham he was not even a nation just his household praise the Lord but what he had and he covered in he was honored it was enough to make him a kingdom because he could go out and redeem Lord now on a lot but he could bring the king of Sodom and the people of Sodom from from captive why because he was on a covenant there was a covenant that was governing him that was protecting him that was profiling strength even though he just gave the man in his house say you know uh uh maybe States and Cutlass and whatever he had and it was not what he used to actually uh uh uh deliver them it was the thought of going Library Branham says in adoption message he said it was the very top that Abraham had of glory after a fallen brother and because it was the word of God God back him up that's why God met him right after the battle was over to show that Abraham you were not in this alone I was with you because you were doing what was right the kingdom of his dear son is not an efflicted like brother Branham said he said it's a spiritual Kingdom and we come we come into it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he has delivered us from the power of Darkness there is no grip of Fear on us yeah we can get afraid you know when teens cross our mind but there is not a great the power of darkness is one that holds one down there is not a great now the same word that is used as the power of darkness is also used and uh impeding as the chains of Darkness now you think about this hold that thought of power of darkness in your in your and and and let's look at uh second PD chapter two second Peter chapter two why people are not keeping their keeping their victory you know why people are not keeping their victory is because most of the time we just have it on the outside we don't allow that word to go through we don't allow that word to go in as to shine forth in US praise the Lord second Peter chapter 2 verse 4. this will talk about the Lord Jesus for God for if God spend that the angels that sin but cast them down to Hell and deliver them into chains of Darkness you know verbena used this in souls in prison and uh and remember now what he taught us in souls in praising he talks about the region of the Lost and the region of the bless you know because he said it was a dimension he said it was a word it's it's a region where the person could travel you know in in fear they are here on this Earth You know but they are in that region of lust because there's a chain of Darkness now also think also now to be able to put this in a place where it will balance in your mind like brother Branham says the chain of circumstance when Satan will be bound for thousand years is not a literal change that is put on his hands it's a chain of circumstance so this chain of Darkness is a power of darkness is something that is holding the people down from getting to the baptism of the Holy Ghost something that is holding the people down for for just living a decent life you you just think about it think about it why why should people you know uh uh I mean in the message of the hour and and I mean the feeling on the word of God and is still struggling with uh I mean with with all of these things with makeups let me take it for that for an example just struggling with all of these uh maybe the fingernail polish or you know uh struggling and they want to cut their head in they always they are always dreaming always there is something always driving to a wall this time there was just some kind of a pool in them that is always driven to the world star better animal talks are in CEO date and and people were asking about you know uh uh uh using uh uh uh weed and I mean different things I mean uh the head and uh you know for women and they have short hair and he says he says that he says that's okay just use something you know that looks natural but what is it in it that will make you know uh uh uh I mean uh there is just something of the flag there was just something in it where people were always just struggle to be driven to the side just to look different we just always want a little bit of wall at church what is that what what is holding people that they can they cannot just walk freed and step in the Liberty that God has given to them now this is this is what I'm saying here because the scripture says if our heart condemned us now we have confidence with God and then if we will be Earnest with ourselves many of the time those things that we permit there is a condemnation in our heart we know that it's not about just doing it there is something that is holding you back that's that's why I'm trying to drive to tonight there is something that is holding you back for you to be able to just step into the Liberty that God has given you the liberty of of being the Son of God the liberty of being a daughter of God why make a person to be embarrassed of their faith when they are not in church what makes them to be embarrassed what makes them to be able to to step out in the midst of friends and co-workers and and you I mean you just don't have to make yourself a fanatic just be a son of God taught us about chain of circumstance there's a power he says there are two great forces that is warring one is pulling us into the blessing pulling us into our inheritance another one just keep holding us back we always have a reason why we should not go forward a reason why we should not step on the liberty of God's world we will always make a reason and the prophet of God say in life full of excuses it's not worthy of the Gospel God the same God Paul say they're called light out of Darkness the Earth was covered with Darkness upon the Deep and he said let there be light he called light out of Darkness and when the light came the darkness disappeared he says that same God has shown for this light this light called the message of the hour is not just for knowledge it's a light that must shine forth in our heart because as we will look as we continue along we will lock the scripture over and over call us children of light and you cannot be a Child of Light until you are born of light because light will only give birth to light the scripture says we must walk in the light as he is in the light Paul says don't sleep as doors that sleep in the night because you are children of light the rich there is something about a Son of God a daughter of God that is burning inside amen something that is bright inside that makes you full of Hope for a faith full of joy full of laughter a chain of circumstance a power of Darkness he has translated us from that the word has come to break that but Branham says that little boy told his sister little sister don't fear there's a man here that can turn on the light foreign for this light in our heart in our heart I mean the light can shine so bright in our heart that we can see all the things some of these things you can even see them and you can trust them to your grandparents if you ever met them for me it is it's a little bit difficult because I didn't meet none of my grandparents so you had a big feet so I can trace big feedback to my grandparents you know why should I get a complex about it you know what should I get a complex about it I don't want to be like anybody else I want to be myself and that's what the light has shown for what is the thing that is holding us back I was talking with with with a sister now she's she's away from me yet and you know she she had a some things and she needed me to cancel all the ballet and we were talking from one thing to another you know and uh for some for some reason our our conversation after I you know advise on what she wanted to do and the information that she wanted and then we just we just drove a little bit into talking about different things I was asking how their little church is she goes to a Pentecostal church and I just talking to her at the church it has the pastor you know and different things we were talking and how you people you know carrying on with the service and things and you see that she's a good Christian girl and she loved the Lord and we were just talking about one thing from another I don't know how the conversation came in and then I told her I mean we started we started uh our conversation just went into into communion you know and I was you know and she was telling me Oh no well I mean the Pastor says uh you know we we are now ready for communion yet you know the church is not ready for communion yet she says but there is just something in my heart they want to you know uh they want to partake of it and she visited a message church and uh and she was around for the time of communion you know and she was just sharing that with me she says she says since that service I just had this thing in my heart now see what God did God brought her in in the light of Truth you know that makes her she want to break away now she want to experience you know so I just brought it simply down to her as his as his wealth you know by Faith by the confession of faith we we receive the Lord Jesus the Paul says by our our mouth we confess and with our heart we believe that's true but it's not enough I says what next happened the Jesus that we have received by faith we identified ourselves with him in baptism so when we go down to the water this Jesus that we have received in our faith about faith we identify ourselves when when we go there we now we identify with the body of Jesus I said but what next come again we want to partake of it you know we want to partake of the body we we want to I mean we are just just just be identified in the body not just uh taking on a name but we want to partake of it and I mean as the more we talk about it you know you could just see how the grace of God just just came down and you know and just make the subject so clear in her mind I was saying that says I don't know why I don't know why people you know Jesus said his word was the bread of life why should we think that we are we are uh uh you know qualified to be able to fee on this spiritual word and then a natural type we can what is holding people back you know it can be a darkness of tradition a darkness of uh of uh uh all teachings a darkness of seeing the darkness and all of those things but the light has shown for in our heart for us to be able to step forward God has called us to the inheritance of the sins in light they are inheritance Divine Healing joy unspeakable full of Glory God putting sounds in our heart you know I was just thinking about that as we we come to the close of this service tonight we have all of these people I keep repeating it over and over you know that are having tireless time we have not had the grace by our way of studying or God has not blessed us to be to be scientists but you think about it in this time word the whole world is shut down people are learning to be creative because we are made from a creator that is a creative power that is coming out and I'm telling you when we get out of this I mean people are just listening to a Christian radio how they have they have created games that people can play with their children Chris I mean Christian games and different things and as the Son of God as a daughter of God what are we doing with our time if that light is shining forth in our heart maybe you might say if I don't have the skill to draw I don't have the skill to to to print I don't have the skill to write a book are you spending time in prayer are you investing time in prayer are you just taking someone on your heart and just spending time everybody in this time now I mean people are are sowing Max nobody know them they just put it in the Box they send it to this Hospital they will send it over to a police station Benjamin Franklin he was he was looking to bring for life to help Humanity he said he caught it and because it was truth another man came on that inspiration you know every one of us we are turning light on in our home and it's a blessing to humanity for a matter of fact if we didn't even have electricity I would not be preaching here tonight we'll just go straight back to the book of Acts [Laughter] it will be house to house we have you have to have me in your heart before we have service yeah right but they thought that he had the inspiration he had is not a blessing to us a blessing to humanity he never knew nothing about the seventh seal he never knew nothing about Malachi 4. but yet he has something to give back to humanity I'm saying all of this to just encourage us we might not have the ability to make apps you know where people can search uh uh scripture in different things and I I share that with you the other time we had their service you know brother clever God bless that young man he I mean created I have I just spoke to him the other day and what he wanted to do was just for young people every day he sent out a Bible verse and a quote and people can comment on it you know uh and I was listening to another young man podcast or another program that he had for youth today and and I mean it's just it's just bringing that thing up if we would just use our time and feed our mind on the negative things that on the internet you are creating darkness in your heart you are calling for more darkness in your heart children of light we must spend time around things that would bring for light I may wish you a call a brother and just talk about the word actually said what have you been reading let's walk in the light as he is in the light let's be able to do something I mean something that would just make you happy that you did something that was good you feel good about it even if you have to just paint your own room paint it you know paint it blue change it painted again praise the Lord because research has also shown as people into the media world the more things that people feed their minds on from the internet they create depression for some many people get their depression and suicide thoughts from the things that they feed from the internet what is that it create more Darkness a cloud your mind nobody loved me nobody cared for me you just stuck in that word a chain of Darkness you cannot see beyond that eating all the good and kindness that people show you you will never be able to see it is a chain of circumstance it's a power of darkness and that's what Christ has come to Deliver Us from we walk in the light beautiful light come where the Dew Drop of nursing a bright just a dew drop of God's mercy are so bright shine around us from day on today Jesus Christ the light of the world let's just play their lesson there tonight as we bring this subject to an end a Darkness that can be felt if you are just feeling weak and you are just

have our share of battles because the war that we find is a war against Darkness Paul said they are inefficient chapter 6 verse 12 we're also not against flesh and blood but we fight against principalities you know we fight against all these evil forces they are all there to darken our mind to darken our heart you know to always push us in a place where we're not supposed to be that is the reason why he said we must have no communion there's no communion Lighthouse with Darkness there is no Fellowship you know there's no Fellowship in darkness whoever you see goes to fellowship and they cut all the lies off the only people that do that are people either they're planning to steal are they planning to kill all the I mean they are hiding themselves but when when when when when when when when children of light goes to Fellowship we want the place to be bright we brighten the place where music We Sing We brighten the place with with laughter we brighten the place with testimony because we are children of light God that called light out of Darkness he has shine in our heart and let that present of light glows in your heart let something either that you have done for somebody or something brother Wesley called me today and then I was talking to him on the phone and he said he said to me and he says he said brother one uh uh and we would love to share that with you I said okay I was so excited and he shared that with me and uh you know this is the cold weather Brandon was talking about you know you know a plaque with common people you know wearing masks and people using sanitizer and all of that it kind of for is I mean a kind of form uh it's just it's just edify me even though I have received the code I have read it before and I was sharing with him you know some Believers have made videos about it but here is the thing that blessed my heart is because she reading the call and they're reading the code has just put a light about the situation you know about what is going on it that portion of the word just brighten the situation you know that God knows all about this that the prophet will speak about something like this many years ago that was the thing that was edifying to me that's the way how the word Prince light when young people if young people will just call one another and and talk about what they were reading in the scripture you might not know what a young sister is going through or another young brother but as soon as you start talking about that word remember the word is light and their word is haunting for a flesh is hunting to be made flesh It's haunting for the flesh to work it's hunting for the flesh to heal it's hunting for the flesh to strengthen so if you just share a portion of the word it could find a flesh that he might edify it could find a flesh that it might encourage let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus you taught us law when we have done all that we know how to do we commit ourselves in your hands as your unprofitable servant dear Lord we all have labored together tonight the sins in their house Lord father and we here tonight has labor to be able to make sacrifice to you to talk about
