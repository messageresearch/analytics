lord amen let's stand on our feeding and uh and read from the book of revelation chapter 10 we want to pick up from where we stop wednesday night talking about the interruption the interruption in time and uh i pray that i want to do a little bible study this morning so i pray that the lord will be able to to help us we'll read revelation chapter 10 few verses there i'll have you sit and then we'll do on all your reading of revelation chapter 4 and then we go right into what we want to share with you this uh this morning revelation chapter 10 let's read from revelation chapter 10 praise the lord let's read from verse one just uh to kind of uh do a scripture reading yet and and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillow of fire and he had in his hand a little bulk and he set his right foot upon the seat in his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion rolleth and when he had cried seven thunder altered their voices and when the seven thunder had altered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seventh on the altar and write them net now remember daniel was told to do the same thing so when are we going to get the writing of these things daniel was told to seal it until the time of the end and this injured in the time of the end was also told to seal it but let's go on right here we'll pray the lord help us and the angel which i saw standing upon the seed and upon the earth lifted up his hands to heaven and swore by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the seed and the things which are dead in that there should be time no longer but that's the interruption amen but praise the lord because it's a contrast amen is a contrast but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophet and the voice which i heard from heaven speak unto me again praise the lord the voice which i heard from heaven speak unto me again and said go and take the little block which is open in the hands of the angel we standed upon the seed and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book praise the lord amen i believe that's what the lord want us to do amen he praise the lord because john was representing us we have to go down to the angel and say give me the book amen because that book is the book of redemption if your name is in that book you would go for it that's the thing that would draw you if you don't have strength to go because it does not belongs to you what belongs to you you go and get it amen go and take the book and he said unto me take and eat it up and it shall be and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in the mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the hands out of the angel hands and eat it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i have eaten and my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesied again before many people nations tongues and kings may the law our blessing to his word you may have your seat our brother will play it as revelation chapter 4 if you want to turn to it or read it from the the poster verses there that will be okay after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sword in the stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne preceded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created amen praise the lord we want to thank the lord for that reading the reading of his word amen but uh uh what what what what will be interesting yet is that uh when you go to revelation chapter 5 then another scene open amen now what i want you to for us to be able to to see here to underline that the the 24 address fell down in in in worship and you know him that lived forever now uh uh uh revelation 4 starts with only one on the throne amen so the 24 headers when they fell down to worship they were worshiping the only one that was on the throne praise the lord amen is now the throne of father son holy ghost only one on the throne and when they fell down to wash it now grab this now because if you don't grab it you'll get you will get caught up in the midst of thoughts here uh when he fell down to worship verse 11 it says thou are worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou have created all things and it's for your pleasure they were created thou are worthy o lord now revelation chapter 5 open and he says and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne the very same one the 24 others fell before and says thou art there o lord are we together it says i i fell down i saw in in the hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw the strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is walty i thought the angels have just said thou i want it praise the lord now don't miss the picture now the angels have just the 24 others have just fell down and says thou are walking to receive every glory honor of power but here we see the scene open the very one that the 24 headers had just failed down before now he has a little book in his hands praise the lord then another angel make a proclamation who is wolfie wu is walking now there's there's a picture there's a scene here praise the lord so if you if you look at the picture or the scene that is playing out here when this proclamation was made in revelation chapter 5 of who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof you will realize that the this proclamation was made for another one because the the angels have just proclaimed the 24 headers have just proclaimed that uh uh dawah walter to receive all glory honor in power now so there's there is there is something that is if you follow now uh to take the book and lose the seals thereof the next verse says and no man praise the lord now so the proclamation of who is water was not for the one that was sitting on the throne the proclamation was looking for a man are you seeing the picture the angers have just thrown down their crowns they have just you know fell on their face oh that's that's the kind of a spirit of worship that that i pray comes upon the people where when we are worshiping you can lift up your hands you can kneed down you can weep and you can just pour out yourself before god praise the lord he's more wealthy he costs more than your pretty dress you are wearing amen glory be to god there may be the new suit that you just bought he costs more than that but the angels have just proclaimed that he is walking this proclamation came no uh uh who is walter to take the book lost the seals no man in heaven none in earth neither under the earth was able to take the book neither to lose the seals and john said i wept much i wept much praise the lord you know what whipping much is when you just can't find counsel you try to stop and then you start again if you have ever been in that place praise the lord amen if you have ever been in that place i wept much praise the lord because no man was found wealthy to open the book here again it comes to the place of of a man so this proclamation is to find a man that is worthy because we know that a wealthy one is on the throne are we together no man's found walter to open a book to open it to read a book neither to look on the things that i did praise the lord open the book read it look dead in revelation chapter 8 and then eat the book but we will get to that one soon and the other and the ever and one of the others said unto me weep now behold the lion of the trap of judah the root of david have prevailed to open the book and to lose the seals thereof praise the lord one of the angels said that you you can you imagine what an attraction john might have just woke up and wiped his face and saying who is this lion of the trap of judah he says and i beheld which means i started to look i'm now looking for the lion of the trap of judah and lord in the midst of the throne and of the phobias in the midst of the other stood a lie what an interruption [Laughter] what an interruption when i'm told that the lion of the trap of judah has prevailed praise the lord what an interruption john with excitement is now looking for the lion but then right in the midst of the throne he sees a lamb praise the lord and i be held in and in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the others still alarm as it had been slain having seven seven seven homes and seven eyes which are the seven spirit of god sent forth into all the earth praise the lord so we see here an interruption that have taken place because john was told to look for the lion of the trap of judah but then he see in the midst of the trump a bleeding line the noun talk took the scene and the lion took the book and he came and took the book out of the hand of him that sat on the throne praise the lord amen now so if if we if we look at the scene that uh that we are dealing with and and uh we spoke a little bit about uh uh you know the we will look at different interruptions in the scripture but what i want to talk on this morning by the grace of god i want to speak on thou must prophesied again thou must prophesy again praise the lord and i want to i want us to look at look at this because john years says in the book of revelation that you know the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy so we see that there's a commission you know he's he told the angel told john to take the book go to the angel to have the book take it and eat it now so we see that this book that the lamb took from him that sat on the throne is the same book in revelation chapter 10. now that book was given to an angel you know uh uh uh you know and and the angel now john had to go to that angel and take the book and eat the book because uh he must prophesy the game which of course he represent the bride throughout the ages so uh that's that's what we want to look at but as as we look at the same year as we look at the scene let's go over to hebrew hebrew chapter 2. let's look let's go over to hebrew chapter 2. praise the lord hebrew chapter 2. hebrew chapter 2. let's read from verse 5. oh i have a i have a note here brother augustin are you the one okay uh thanks for coming to fellowship with us we pray that you feel at home praise the lord hebrew chapter five let's read chapter two reading from verse five the scripture says for unto the angel have he not put in in suggestion the word to come where are he speak but one in a setting place testified saying what is man that thou are mindful of him or the son of man that thou visited him thou made him a little lower than the angels thou crowning him with glory and honor and they set him over the works of their hands thou has put all things in subjection under his feet now if if you look at this picture or what the apostle paul is talking here and you bring it back to revelation chapter five you bring it back to that scene in revelation chapter 5. after the angels and the 24 elders have already identified that the one that is sitting on the throne is is the wealthy one praise the lord but you receive this scene open and and uh uh and this and and this proclamation comfort who is walking now we see now that the wealthiness now is now no uh in one sense kind of for being attributed to a man because no man is found walty praise the lord now so we have to realize we have to realize what the apostle paul is trying to draw us to understanding here is that uh uh you know if if you if you look at the sequence of creation you will realize that god created the angels before he created man amen he created the angels because if there was nothing to worship god he would not be god because god is an object of washing so he created the angels but then in creating man he expressed this in his word that uh uh uh a man will be created in his image and in his likeness praise the lord amen you know in all of his creation there was no there was there was nothing that he did created to be in his image and his likeness then when it comes to the creation of man praise the lord so you you we can realize that there there is some form of of attraction here there is there is something about man that's what the prophets all through the ages david said it in the psalm what is man that thou are mindful of him the angels that was created before man their creation was never put into their suggestion it was when god created a man the first man adam he put everything subject unto others he never told the the angels to name his creation but he told other man to name the creation he never gave the angels dominion and power over his creation but he gave man dominion and power what is man that thou are my fault of him praise the lord what is man amen and do you realize every man that god ever meets he also asks that question who am i when god met moses at the burning bush he said who am i when he may give him he give himself who am i praise the lord what is man that they were mindful of him praise the lord realizing when that proclamation went in in revelation chapter 5 the proclamation was not for god because revelation chapter 4 already testified that god was worthy the proclamation was for a man are we together for amen oh my goodness praise the lord praise the lord if we just realize you know the privilege and uh and the blessings that we have you know of being created by an awesome god praise the lord being created by an awesome god we will just appreciate that amen glory be to god beyond all the the spiritual gifts and whatever we might have just to appreciate the fact that we have been created by an awesome god praise the lord that he made us with his hands the bible said from the dust of the earth he formed man praise the lord and the simon says how wonderful and how fearful with a lot of reverence he made us what is men that thou are mindful of him praise the lord so we see here that uh uh thy god make man in his image because god's desire was to come in the image of a man praise the lord the reason why he made man in his image because that will be his final expression [Music] that will be his ultimate expression praise the lord so that's why revelation chapter 5 is playing out here to show that the one that the 24 headers fell before to proclaim and worship as the wealthy one will now be a man praise the lord that will also be wealthy praise the lord because if if the angels have already declared that thou art wanted to receive every glory in honor they cannot be too wealthy pressing because there was just only one throne praise the lord now so if you see the description here in revelation chapter 5 the bible says let's go back there so you can we can see the beautiful picture the scripture says john said verse 6 and i beheld and lord in the midst of the throne and all the four beasts and in the midst of the other stool alarm as it had been slain praise the lord so you see right in the midst of the throne the lamb came from in the mess of the throne so it's god projecting himself the same one that is on the throne leaving the throne and taking up his royal coat and putting it down and taking cystine elements and dressing himself in bodily form praise the lord oh my that's the reason why when we get to to look at being i mean uh uh the the the commission of prophesying again will realize that how how important it is for us to take that book and eat it praise the lord hallelujah now so we realized that uh uh uh he came out of the midst of the throne he he he took on the flesh and and and and and he took the book now we realized that that this was the book that had the title day this this was the book that the adam lost so he took the book and and now over in revelation chapter 10 that we read is the book that we have to go for and eat because we have to prophesy again amen so in revelation chapter 10 we read he says i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven with uh with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as the sun his feet as a pillow of fire now so we see here that the the same one that left the throne and and he know he he uh uh uh projects himself from the throne and and and changed his max amen praise the lord he he's he's now near taking the balkan and coming down to give it to to an earthly angel praise the lord amen but we we there there are some things that we want to look at before we go forward here really uh wednesday wednesday night we were talking about looking at uh uh the interruption from genesis chapter i mean revelation chapter 9 to revelation chapter 10 revelation chapter 9 was the sixth seal talking about the different things that were happening on the face of the earth amen and and what we were trying to to to help ourselves to understand is the other uh uh uh we are going to to to move from one interruptions and different interruptions and while i was studying this subject you know i was i was thinking there is if you even look at time time is an interruption of eternity praise the lord and italian internation you see eternity does not have it does not have times pain praise the lord many many times the way we think about eternity because we are time creature we we think that uh you know what at this particular time eternity we begin you know after the word and then we go into eternity has been there eternity is there eternity will always be praise the lord message profession but brahm says it was just a little pork that god introduced and the purpose of that for him to express himself so time is it's an interruption of eternity praise the lord glory be to god amen so so we we realize we realize that is is it's a nature of our god it looks like he just loved enjoy interrupting interrupting our sinful life when we think we had it all together praise the lord and we think we were on the peak of whatever we would and then he come by his grace and just interrupted with a new birth praise the lord oh my goodness he interrupted and it looks like the life i used to live are living normal [Laughter] [Music] what an interruption praise the lord my goodness amen the new birth is an interruption praise the lord what what are trials what are trius they are interruptions oh man that's why we don't like it that's why we don't we don't embrace it because it looks like everything was happening until until until i came down there until oh glory be to god you love the lord this morning oh let's just enjoy the lord amen praise the lord hallelujah the lover of our sword is in the house let's just enjoy the lord amen praise the lord hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen oh we thank you lord now so we we uh uh uh as we as we look at this okay coming back from wednesday night uh revelation chapter nine and it talks about all the different pledges that will come so uh uh uh what the the thought there is that the there is not an orderly sequence with this an orderly sequence in in this time because one we keep interrupting the other praise the lord okay when we keep it interrupting the other until the whole thing just fall in that's the time that we are living in okay they never even told us about uh uh finding a good result of of of uh corona part a corona pable came and interrupted corona part 8 and corona pass c and d and you know it would just be an interruption praise the lord but the the beauty here in the in the scripture that we are looking at in this time of the pledges when the plagues when the sith seal is falling we realize in the midst of it a mighty angel come down also praise the lord now the mighty angel comes down to create an interruption for his people to smash them out praise the lord now take for example the scripture or the egypt at a time where the the the the the put the hebrews to work and how to build breaks with our straw i mean egypt was building their kingdom never than before they were stretching out their walls they were they were protecting themselves and building their empire and here comes this man with just a stake in his hands and he interrupted the whole thing [Music] he could be a type of our mighty injured in revelation chapter 10 praise the lord he interrupted the whole thing they had to put the work on heart praise the lord the economy of egypt starts to go down because now the hebrews are rallying around their deliverer praise the lord amen that nation that was once uh a reverence and fear in the world now starts to have trouble because an injured of the law came and met a man on the backside of the desert and gave him a commission now he has a stake and he's walking right in there praise the lord saying let my people go praise the lord oh one of the decent country now we're hearing fleas are all over the place frogs are in the kingdom water turning to blood one after another one after the other praise the lord there is something also i want i want to also see uh uh we read on on on wednesday night revelation chapter 10 and then we say it's the other we see the revelation chapter 10 starts with a conjunction and and every verse is a conjunction and and and and and crowd and and and when the seven thunders and and the angel we shall we stand on the earth and and swerve by him that live it but when it came to the seventh verse we see a contract praise the lord now a contracts in the scripture genesis chapter 2. let's go to genesis chapter 2. there are few verses there there's a way i wanted for us to go but uh uh it has to be a private bible study for us to do that because we don't have time we won't have time to do that but it's beautiful when you when you study the scripture and you and you and you see how those things how those things play out is very beautiful genesis chapter 2 let's see here let's go to verse 15 genesis chapter 2 verse 15 and the lord god took man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god commanded man saying of every tree of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat but praise the lord now so that contrast is enough to make you to pay attention praise the lord now if you study through the scripture that will give you a lot of few verses to look at but if you study through the scripture you will see that whenever those contracts happen it shows a time sequence praise the lord now in this case this contrast is announcing but of the tree of knowledge which means there's a contrast here the v that is broken it will change time amen praise the lord now that is the same way in revelation chapter 10. i'm trying to help you so you can grab my thoughts what i'm going in revelation chapter 10 an angel and him that swear it and and this and then when it came to verse seven but in the day of the voice of the seven angel that that contrast introduced at time space are you seeing the picture introduced at time space genesis chapter 17 let's see another one there then we can go on maybe we need to have this all night bible study amen genesis chapter 17 verse 19 let's go quickly and god says sarah the wife shall bear thee a son in thee and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for and ever i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly 12 princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation but you see god is contracted but my coveting praise the lord i'm not i'm not uh i'm not i'm not refusing ishmael i'm not denying that he's your see but what i want to do my coveting purpose my predestinated plan must come by isaac praise the lord amen oh i didn't know why ishmael would be 12 princes hey you would get great nation oh you would but [Laughter] oh my but in the dead of the voice of the seven engine when he shall begin to sound at that that bracket of time what god is saying everything that is happening on earth on the the sixth hills and all the judgment when that angel begin to sign i will wrap everything up it's going to be a quick shot work that's what he's announcing but when he shall begin to sign time shall be no more oh my praise the lord praise the lord amen now so you see see that's verse seven and and and when when he make that that proclamation in verse seven but when when this when the seven angel begins to sound time shall be no more what he did he went straight and gave john his commission because when this thing is happening john it's time for you to eat the bubble because there is no time so go to that angel and get the bark because there is no time when you recognize the dead the message of your day there's no time to food around there's no time to play church games praise the lord there's no time to play church games the commission is go and take the book and eat the book because thou must prophesy again thou must prophesy again and i think that's where most people get trapped most people get trapped because many have not really studied and understand the again moving so they lean into impersonation and think that they need to have discernment gifts or they need to have the vibration of the hands but what the scripture tells us we will read read read some quotes here but let's let's do our bible studies first amen praise the lord genesis chapter 4 amen genesis chapter 4 verse 25 the bible says and again adam knew his wife amen and again adam knew his wife and she had a son by the name of seth amen so seth was an again woman for abel that king killed beautiful are you are you seeing the picture amen because the two sons we know that one was in the in in in in in the god sea line and the other one was in the serpent sea lion praise the lord so you see god is making that church to prophesy again why because he said unto eve the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent praise the lord so you see that again woman uh is it's not an impressing nation it's not wearing that you know a bell bucker with brother branham and wearing cowboy hearts and going there and you know no are we together if you are doing it because of appreciation that's fine but if you are doing it thinking that you are in a gay moment praise the lord are we together if the church said well let's let's let's let's bring pentecost back again this they saw all their things and related to the apostrophe let's do that you will be breaking scripture because god allowed that time to spread the church so the a gay movement is not for you to not start selling everything you know i saw seed to the church so seeded that's not a gay moment are we together genesis chapter 8. if you read genesis chapter 8 you will realize that there was an again moment of the dope i love this one man i love it praise the lord hallelujah i love this one there was a game movement for the dove you realize that after noah sent the raven out it never came back amen praise the lord because he saw what attracted its nature a lord it loved dead rotting meat so he saw it all over the place it was having its revival praise the lord and he waited and waited and i mean the raven was not coming back glory be to god amen hallelujah you know how god is he's he's he's just a master of wisdom do you know how the raven feeding elijah stumble a lot of people yes sir i stumble them because when they look at the raven in genesis chapter 8 and knowing the nature of the raven then how can god use the raving to feed a prophet [Laughter] oh my goodness uh how we wish that it was just dove all through the bible but no praise the lord god was showing in time how he will raise up people in their struggling nature but they will still sustain the voice of elijah praise the lord amen now so right here in genesis chapter 8 you see here there were three sending out of the dove but only two again moving that will completely break scriptural time there were three sending out of the dove the dove went out the first time a room about the emphasis grabbing down the emphasis well it found no place to rest that was the emphasis he found no place so he came back and with that no one knew that the water would stay all over the place praise the lord now the second again moment was the dove went out and this time it fought a place because it had to rest on the tree to pick the leaf a an olive tree to rest upon and to pick the leaf and then it came back praise the lord hallelujah amen and then the third time when noah sent it the door never came back praise the lord because the dove has already announced on the second coming he announced on the second coming that the land was ready to be inhabited so the dog went but that will break scripture it will break the again principle praise the lord so that dope have to return and that's why we saw on the river jordan [Laughter] when john jesus came to john in the river what did the scripture says the spirit of god came down like a dolph what was the dog looking for resting place and the holy ghost find rest in a man [Applause] the word of god cannot be broken it cannot be broken god's word can never be broken if god said you will have a gay moment you are going to have a gay moment i believe that this bride is going to prophesy again god is going to have a people raising the people up is not coming in the future it's happening right now i believe it's happening right now [Applause] just this gone uh uh uh uh uh december 10th the first day in virginia brother gyro was just telling me there they were having their all night meeting their pastor slo-ma he died actually in the church oh and those garlic brothers stood around him and praying light back into his body [Applause] praise the lord [Music] it's not coming in the future church it's happening right now it's going on right now you better go to the angel and get the book because you cannot prophesy again until you have eaten the book it's not coming in the future it's happening right now oh my goodness praise the lord my my my mind see brother brandon verbum talks about this this this vision that this brother had about him a dream that his brother had about him there in the west where he talks about you know the brother dreaming and brother branham streaming in you know in his dream and saying i would ride this straight again i would ride this straight again now see when brother branham talks about it in on the wings of a snow wipe door he explained what a man praise the lord you read about the dream or in north in that no of him that is where he said that uh talks about the brother dream but yeah over in on the wings of a snow white door he said why me an old man suffering all my life why did he hire me now i believe i will ride this straight again i got a message to bring and i and i say to my father tonight lord your seven reporting for service brother bennett was not talking about him raising or when he died to come back to life again that's not what he was saying praise the lord all of these people you know believing in the return ministry well let them keep waiting i'm waiting on the coming of the lord he says and i said i said to my lord father tonight lord your seven is reporting for service now better man have already as that's that's why he says pleading in the wings of a snow-white dog how he have experienced a supernatural healing for the thing to have bothered him all of his life now he says i'm ready now for service i'm ready to go in the field now because he has healed me god's only provide a pledge see what he says here he says i'm getting pretty off and i taught will there be another revival praise the lord will there be another revival he says i will see you another time what is he talking about so you see the whole thing about uh writing the trade again is is is is god dealing with the people the same thing that uh uh god told uh uh uh joshua there over in in the promised land he says he says circumcise the people the second time no it was not a double circumcision but he was telling them because they went all through the weight of their 40 years without the covenant of circumcision and now they were about to enter into their inheritance god was telling more joshua revive because you have to realize that the land that they were coming to enter that was the very land where god told abraham to circumcise himself and this entire household how can they come and take the inheritance that's the problem with the church people want the power of god without the baptism of the holy ghost it can never happen you cannot have a change of life without being born again [Music] just your intellectual thoughts of the ma of the message is not enough to put you in the rapture [Music] there has to be a quickening power there has to be a power that would come down that's the reason why he said the the the the the dynamics of this church will be another again moving if you refill wish me it was filled first [Laughter] the dynamics of this church would be the refilling of the holy ghost not an intellectual conception it's not going to be a bash of which church you came from it's going to be your life will there be another revival where i see another time he says and just remember from the west will come the white house rather we this time it's not uh he said we we will ride this trail again so he's tied to a revival that the bride will have a revival they will come and quicken him there will be a people that will take god at his word we will ride this trail again oh praise the lord oh praise the lord are we together are you ready for the move of god [Music] you expecting the move of god do you have any expectation praise the lord amen oh praise the lord hallelujah amen praise the lord we will ride this straight again we will have another a gay moment amen we would definitely have another the gay movement you know abraham dr well when he bought that piece of lane and and and and uh and the philistines came in and and cover all the well praise the lord the land was not given to him he he paid for it he purchased the land he had the title lead praise the lord he had a tie today and because he had a tie to the he had a right to another again woman how will it happen it would take isaac it would take isaac to revive those whales because it was his inheritance he had a right to are we together joseph would give his brothers another again moving they will come down to egypt and he will see them can you imagine how his blood was boiling amen not out of anger his blood was bawling out of nervousness praise the lord all in his mind what has happened to my father was my brother benjamin praise the lord and all these things going through his mind and he's seeing these very brothers that sold him out praise the lord the bible says he will talk to them and then he will go behind the curtain and cry he will cry he said lord i said where are you coming from where's your father oh yeah our father is there he's he's an old man now so he can't come you know they're running their mouth and talking different things how many are you praise the lord glory be to god and for david for for joseph to to protect himself he was speaking in the egyptian language using an interpreter oh we we are 12 brothers but one one of our brothers you know and you know joseph just listening to all of this wanting to be sure that everybody is okay that none of the brothers have died the lord and the amazing thing is that he brought them to denim and set them in their birth order he said them in their birth order from reuben to simeon praise the lord they are looking at one another how he says come and eat and this one no don't say that you go there you come here you come here glory be to god i believe you're thinking in your mind all mine oh my what is this who is this man praise the lord amen so to give them on a gay movement he put his silver cup now remember savor means redemption amen so he put his silver cup in the mill put their money back in everything and when they went a little bit he says go after them praise the lord while we were yet sinner amen while we were yet sinner they had no idea what was happening and they come and find the cop there oh my goodness why you have to do no i never did it praise the lord the first thing everybody found their money in their bag oh my goodness how would i go to prison for this what is this what is the law doing they say oh because of joseph oh my goodness praise the lord but he was giving them another a gay movie praise the lord why because there was a dream that all the brothers had to bow down to him [Music] so they had to prophesy the game amen you see that's the reason why the scripture says the the the testimony of jesus is a spirit of prophecy and you see how how how the church word has wrong wrong with that because the only no preferences to be in the mouth so they can say anything and say you know i prophesy i feel good you know i prophesy but the spirit of christ the testimony of jesus what jesus is doing in your life is a spirit of prophecy is prophesying that we have a living god that can change a sinner to sin a god that can raise people above habits and change your life for the better praise the lord amen you can be as stubborn as whatever stubbornness you want you that you never brought yourself on this earth let god get ahold of you [Music] praise the lord amen be sobbing you can pluck your ears to the word of god but let god get a hold of your heart oh my praise the lord the bell has just rank praise the lord i've not started preaching here anytime since i'm over trying to find my footing [Laughter] [Music] praise the lord somebody i love can say i'm finding my bearings amen praise the lord now so you see we're going to have an again moment let's let's get to the philadelphia church let's read this quickly so we can find a place to close here uh uh but burban suppose to be doing something with some of the saints after church this afternoon so let me now wear you out let's read from the philadelphia church so we can we can just wrap this thing up the lord bless us as long as the holy spirit has helped you to grab the talk that's what is important because he is the preacher i'm not the preacher you know i'm not the preacher you know he's the preacher so if he helps you to grab the talk he can preach the rest of the message to you without me saying anything now brother bram said in the philadelphia church he says in order to understand the wealth of many involved in behold i set before you an open door and no man can shut it we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another each age running over into another overlapping interrupting there is an overlapping a melting or fading into rather rather than an abrupt end there will not be an abrupt end the sequence of time will happen one thing will happen to another there is not an abrupt end the lord amen and melting and fed it into rather than an abrupt end all a clear-cut stat no we'll go on and just like the world is happening the rapture will take place the tribulation will happen the 144 thousand will be caught the wedding stop it will just happen like that there is not an abrupt end there is not a clear cost tax this edge particularly flows into the next age and that only this this is overflowed into the last age but the last age is in many respects simply and carrying on of the six age praise the lord you see that's the reason why the the loss is messenger cannot cannot be identified because people understand they understand they agree with the sequence of the reformation they saw the effect of luther message praise the lord amen and the same thing also with every age that's the reason why all of these denominations and different things because when god raised up a man like he did with luda and and and he stomped the church with his thesis and brought a revival the people got stuck to that what what they were waiting on if if a new thing would happen you know it would be announced we would come to the council we will all agree that now yell at move on god don't work like that praise the lord while they were holding and becoming former and and establishing principle and staying this is what luther said this is why we believe god just moved on right in england a young man john wesley started preaching foreign he never even knew he was a messenger praise the lord he just started so you see there is no glare across that that's the reason why unless we understand scriptural pattern you will never understand the church ages so he says this is in particular is a carrying on of the sixth age the seven age a very short age why because but in the days of the voice of the seven angel it's a short age it's the age to wind up everything is the age to tie the loose ends praise the lord so you see the six ages going on and the pledges are falling and this thing is happening and that thing is happening the mighty angel comes down in simplicity the word still going on and different things are happening that verse 7 is your last age when that angel begins to sound it's a very short age a lot of everything that was happening was all all part of the six age the healing revival was all part of the sixth age it was just the continuation from azusa street praise the lord you see that's the reason why this baptist preacher was he was attracted to what he saw among the pentecostal people because it was just going to be a continuation of the pentecostal blessing a very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil of every ages and yet all the reality of pentecost [Laughter] praise the lord amen we read that wednesday that every preceding age inherit the thing from from from the next age all the evil of all the ages but yet the pentecostal blessing is here in simplicity the reality of the pentecostal blessing not emotion we don't have to make up that's the reason why i don't care how much it says if it does not line up with this word there is something wrong with it oh yeah because we're being prophesied we've been told there will be false christs there will be false anointing words operating amen gather up into one one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of the pentecost once the philadelphia edge has has about run is caused the laodicea ash quickly comes on the scene and brings forth the ties and the weights toward the harvest it's a gathering age it's a gathering age that's why we will have a one word church we have a one word government it's it's uniting time that's the spirit of the age to bundle amen he said gather the weeds that's what jesus says gather the wheat into the bomb and the ties must also be gathered to be burned are we together may god help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of the sixth age learned patient we read the history of the lives of these great christians praise the lord there's a podcast that i listened to this this christian guy was able to gather uh a testimony of uh of uh of men through the ages that in in in in the simpliest way the homeless way that is too forgotten and how they were persecuted how some of them were killed and in praising they called it's called the forgotten podcast if you want to listen to it it's it's really edifying we read the history of the life of these great christian men these great christians what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all overcome in over impatient and haste we want it to happen praise the lord amen why the church now on fire because you are now on fire well why is this happening we are not patient praise the lord to be able to work with our young people we we go on with with that with that touch in our mind you know we we build we build our uh uh uh expectation we are dealing with an internal god and yet we put time to our situations expecting god to meet those things by our time he's not working on your time amen praise the lord instead of appreciating the things that god is doing in our lives we become impatient with ourselves praise the lord and we write ourselves off broadband says see the patient that they had in that age oh may god help us he goes on to say to them because you because you have taken my word and and live it and thereby become patient the world make them patient they were not they were not resting on their emotion you know appreciate your your experiences the different way that god is dealing with you but never put your experience above the word of god praise the lord the lord there with me in this way the lord there with me that way oh it's all wonderful but he want us to grow in his word praise the lord because the word is a constant daily dealing the word is not a one-time dealing it's a constant daily dealing that's why the prophet of god says a christian reads their bible and prayed every day because it's a constant daily dealing it's not a one-time thing because you have taken my word and leave leave it and thereby become patient i will keep you from the hour of temptation we shall come upon the word this is this is the in in in in the book of revelation to try them that lord upon the earth now here again we see the overlapping of two ages for this promise has to do with the the end of the gentile period amen which accumulate in the great tribulation praise the lord there is an overlapping year the the great hour of temptation is the tribulation in the real bible saints when the bible expressed that in the book of revelation that a great hour of temptation is speaking about the tribulation but see what is going to happen because the age overlaps and the seven edge comes right in as a parenthesis as a contract to get a people ready for the rapture and sweep them out we are going to experience some of the things of the six age some of the things that's the reason why all of these things are happening we are all experiencing the uh uh coronavirus we are all you know wearing max and you know getting sick and taking medicine and believing god and all of that praise the lord now so i will keep thee from the hour of temptation we shall come upon all the world to try them that do it upon the earth this verse is not a declaration that the church will go into and through the tribulation if amended it will have said that but but it said i will keep thee from the hour of temptation praise the lord so which means that there are there are pre-tribulation things that will be building while we are here praise the lord that there are pre-tribulation things that will be building we we just experienced it just in the past two years all the nations came to the place and you know while now they agree on the marks mended praise the lord and whoever you were i mean whatever you think that that was their agreement and that's what they wanted whether you were the president or the king praise the lord didn't you see queen elizabeth with a little pretty max on her face now so he goes ahead and he says here it does not mean that the church will go through the tribulation it just means that we will experience a pre-tribulation thing and god will also use those things to wake us up from our sleep he will use those things to clean out to help us clean ourselves up let's go ahead yeah there are a few things i just just want to read this and then we'll be close this tribulation is exactly like the tribulation in eden it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to god's command the word comparing it with the second telling eve god know that when you do this your eyes will be open and you will be like god praise the lord it would be an appealing thing it would be an appealing thing and see what he says i want to make more comment but let just read here this temptation is exactly like the temptation in eating it will be a very inviting proposition held by a direct opposition in god's uh to god's com commanded word and year from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be so very right that's how many will go right into the world council of churches many will sit right in the message church because it will look so convincing praise the lord amen yet in another sense there are others that will be so radical and they will go on the far end we have to stay in the middle of the way praise the lord and yet from him from from the the standpoint of human reasoning it will be very it will be so very right so enlightening and life-giving as to fool the world only the very illet will not be full listen to this now that the temptation will come as follow the incommunica move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling christ's prayer that we all might be one become so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly praise the lord all true enhance to principle you know that is that is erected by the law so that no people will be recognized as actual church unless honor direct or indirect denomination of this council praise the lord i will say something here let me just read a little bit little groups will will will lose childhood privilege etc until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people example right now unless the local minister association approved in many is not most uh if not most city one cannot rent a building for religious service praise the lord to become a chaplain in the army service or hospital i had a direct experience with this one time i took the thought that i i was going to talk with uh with the uh albert chaplain uh person responsible and see what all the requirement was to become a chaplain in the hospital so i had to direct direct experience to become a chaplain in the army service and hospital etc it is now almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to a trinitarian incommunica group praise the lord you have to be on one of that or as they cannot take you in to be a chaplain praise the lord brother jarrod would have been a chaplain in the military but because of the same reason he cannot be a chaplain because it's mandatory you have to have your affiliation with one of the incoming churches you have to confess that you believe in the holy trinity as this pressure increase and it will it will it will you see all of these government-free offers a trap all of these people that get so they get so ginger to run into uh you know government free giving and government free debt and you know and all the the the website and think work with your hands if you can [Music] a person that is that is sick and is eligible for it let them have it praise the lord we're not shown in it we're not blasting it it was designed to help the people that are in need if you are not in need you don't need it it was designed to help the other leg praise the lord unless you want to change your age come we help you change your birth certificate you got to put powder on your hair to make it white it was there it was it was installed to be able to help the people there are people that must that must benefit from it an elderly sister an elderly brother that has worked serve the country it's for them to enjoy it's not for people tweaking and tweaking and all of that just for greed possessed with a spirit of lies i'm not angry with you i'm just warning you that it's debate that you swallow one of these days you will not be able to vomit it praise the lord we we we had a uh some example there you know uh and all of the the the you know free packages during the the coronavirus time and you know some of our managers did not even read the fine prints it looks like it's for everybody but then you get inside you get trapped and so many will be tempted to go alone for they will feel it is better to serve god publicly in the framework of this organization than not to serve god at all publicly but the earth to believe the devil's lie is to serve satan even though you may want to call him jehovah praise the lord but the ilit will not be deceived praise the lord the elect will not be deceived you see that's the benefit of doing things by the word when you leave the world you will always find a shortcut you always try to produce something you will have to make something convincing for you to believe it but if you know the word says this and you say amen to that word no matter how many thoughts flocks your mind you say i say amen and let the church say amen and i say amen devil i say amen [Laughter] amen for believe the devil light is to serve satan even though you may want to call him jehovah but the illidan will not be deceived furthermore the illet will not only be kept but as the move become the image erected to the beast the saints will be gone in the rapture right in that period of time praise the lord amen god has given us a word to let off the pressure there is no pressure that this word of god cannot live off you no pressure must force you to do things that you're not supposed to do [Music] amen no pressure may force you to compromise your body compromise your mind compromise your faith when we have been given the word to lift up the pressure because we were prophesied again now we will we are prophesying again praise the lord this is our hour we are standing in our hour glory be to god god is you know dealing with his people using his children in in the simplest way my sister was telling me her testimony yesterday of god moving on the scene and you know when and just healing the boy she lay her hands on him taking care of the little boy's shaking and just intelligence our child was revived on his feet apply the word and see the word working for you just apply the word put the word to work don't force it it's a seed just just water it with praise water if we praise lord that's your word i praise you i bless your name and see that tenor plane musicians you can come praise the lord amen oh i'm not even i'm not even starting my message praise the lord
