have service on friday night friday evening just like our regular evening service that will now be serviced wednesday night but we will have service friday night we will have service sunday morning and sunday evening we have brother flynn take and sister hannah coming from alaska to be with us that weekend and i want to remind us just by the roadside there there are those flower bushes are getting high up and getting close to the to the stop sign so if we can make it our duty to to be able to do some outside working this will be to the young brothers praise the lord and okay and also we were planning uh just before uh 2020 brought a surprise to us we thought last year we were planning to do some some some tour for for the young people and thinking about what to what to do to be able to have some time to spend together and just and just maybe make a trip but uh with with everything they have happening around us and around the world we could not do that so this year we we've been trying to work on something so we have brother but andrews and sister christian we kind of appoint them to work on a city tour for us so there are some historical uh what what i wanted for us to do was to visit some of the religious sites in uh in minneapolis a couple of years back there was a paper that came through through our office uh were there were there were certain sites you know there were according to that paper minneapolis is a very religious city religious in the sense that there are a lot of religious things happening you know and and there were some some sites even place of uh you know where cults gather and different things you know so uh i thought that uh we were going to work on there to be able to visit those sites but it looks like the the group that started there maybe they never got enough business and maybe they went out of business so we tried to trace them and we couldn't get any information on them so we decided to do something on our own so brother brother brother andrews have been able to come up with some uh historical churches in minneapolis and some of the history that have to go with them so we are planning to have a saturday where we can we can be able to do a tour of of of those few places and i thought we could have uh put it on there saturday of labor day but it will be too tight and and and some might be not be able to partake so we will find a better weekend and then we will let you know uh the cops that might go with there because we want to pretty much keep everybody together they talk in a way that brother andrews did it uh the torah is somehow self-guided it leads you from one side to another so you can you can drive on your own but the thing about it there is that we will now wait for you we're not going to get yet and says uh oh i mean traffic coming in they say okay let's wait uh brother one is coming let's wait for him until he gets here you know so if you can drive on your own that would be nice you know if you can be able to get there and and what we want to do is that with all the information we have we would like to share with you ahead of time if you want to make some research on those places and be able to share with us what you what you gather you know because it would just be a time an outdoor time where we just want to just visit our city that we live in you know and uh i got the thought of this uh uh years back like i said and and and the the thing that came to my mind is that uh you know daniel the the prince of pesha you know uh uh handled down your prayer and then somewhere brother branham says if the prince of pesha handled down their prayer for 21 days what would the prince of laodicea do and and the truth about the mata that is that every spirit have a prince that's the reason why every city has an influence the people in new york behave different from the people in minneapolis you know so all of those things go back into you know uh uh uh you know spiritual warfare and all of that but it's good for you to know for us to know the environment that we live in praise the lord so when we come here we will know that uh you know there are a lot of a lot of demons that fight us before we get here on wednesday night you know because uh the devil would want us to do everything but not to be here thinking walter is the lamb amen i mean he will just want us to do everything and anything but not to be here on wednesday night you know uh uh you know he might not even mind you reading your bible on your own and as much as it can create a lot of distraction for you not to concentrate and just get you in a religious flow i'm reading my bible but he knows the supernatural strain that comes when we come together you know when we bring our faith together before we leave from here the faith has to be hundred percent and it becomes hundred percent when he show up praise the lord when he show up then it becomes the faith of the son of god himself that's why we can say all things are possible so uh we will we will come up with a dead and uh and develop what we have and then we will let you know and also share with you what the cost you know years back we we were almost giving everything free from this church you know we we will we will do you know uh young people think it's free we bring you food with everything at a certain time i just thought that you know those kind of a kindness intention our intention is not to do justice to this subject our intention is to bring an inspiration out of the subject to be able to edify the sins tonight praise the lord so with that being said uh i we want to look at few scriptures in the bible that talks about one hour praise the lord are we together daniel chapter four daniel chapter four down in chapter four let's look at verse 18. i don't want to do too much of reading i just want to use that to be able to uh keep ourselves together keep our thoughts together tonight verse 18 this dream a dream this this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen now there are all bethesdas that declare the interpretation thereof for as much as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation but thou art able for the spirit of the holy ghost is indeed then daniel whose name was bertie schezer was he was atoned for one hour and he started trouble him the king speak and said bethesda let let net the dream or the interpretation there of troubled betty shares the answer and said my lord the dream to them that hit thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies so uh uh i'll be i was able to pick up that one let's look at matthew chapter 12. i'm just trying to trying to uh make myself comfortable a little bit with with what i want to bring tonight so just bear with me matthew chapter 20 amen let's read from verse eight so when eden was come the lord of the vania said unto his stewards called the laborers and gave them the highest beginning from the last on to the first and when they came that were higher about the 11th hour they received every man a penny but when the first came they suppose that they should have received more and they likewise receive every man a penny and when they have received the mummer against the goodman of the house saying these laws have rough but one hour have only one hour of work and thou have made them equal unto us which have bought the burdens of the heat of the day so we see another one hour are we together i might read a quote on that a little bit matthew chapter 26 matthew chapter 26 let's read from verse 38 then say he unto them my soul exceeding sorrowful even unto death entire year year and watch with me and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying oh father oh my father if it be possible let this cup cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou will and he cometh unto his disciples and and and find them asleep and said unto peter what could ye now watch with me one hour praise the lord now we read uh there in revelation chapter 17 revelation chapter 18 verse 10. let's read from verse 8 therefore shall her play come in one day death and mourning farming and she shall be ultimately burned with fire for strong is the lord who judges her and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and live delicious slave with her shall bewell her and lament for her when they see the smoke of her burning standing a far off for the fear of atomic saying alas alas thy great city babylon the mighty city for in one hour is that judgment come so uh i just read those few uh uh verses tonight just like i said to canada for uh um kind of for free myself a little bit take the nervousness away but now what caught my attention on this i was studying on the message the rejecter came and and uh uh my inspiration on the rejected king is to show that how the word is the king of our kingdom the word of god amen is the king of our kingdom our king is called the word of god that's the lord jesus christ but most of the time when we talk about the lord jesus christ it's so easy for the mind of people to travel back to jesus of nazareth and now realize that the lord jesus christ in our day is his word praise the lord so the the the the thought here is the other uh god has always had a chain of command he has always led his people he has been the king of his people and uh and god uh chain of command uh that was established in the old testament is the law just like paul in the new testament says christ and then and and then is the man and the woman and and just like that the head of every man is christ the head of the woman is the man and you know just like that so it has been in this chain of command where it has been almighty god leading his people then the people requested that god must speak to a prophet and then god told the prophet call a priesthood and then and then after that we realized the office of a king was was little introduced so it's god a prophet you know the priesthood and then the king and uh and there were few men in the scripture moses is one he was both prophet he was priests and he was king praise the lord david in the time also fulfilled that he was a prophet he was a priest when he ate the short bread and he was a king and the next man that also fulfilled that is our lord jesus he was a prophet after moses he was the king a priest after the order of mechistic and he is our king of kings and lord of lords praise the lord so we we see that chain of command and and in the way that it works is that you know just like yeah or israel the lord our god is one god have always used one man praise the lord if god raised up a man to be a prophet he will have one prophet on the scene at a time that the word of the lord will come to are we together amen god order of leadership does not resemble anything like what we have uh uh uh in into this world with with democracy and no god order of leadership has always been one man the king he has never never encouraged or established an opposing party every opposing party to god established himself in in rebelling to god's word they decide to to start opposing god but god never said well you become the opposing party i will be the leading party left fight and see we will win the next election nope god do not lead like that praise the lord so also the same thing comes down to the priesthood there are many priests that will do many work in in the in the tabernacle but there is only one high priest they have never been too high priests at a time now so all of this form of of of leadership that god have in in his uh uh uh hierarchy or chain of command is all in the sense that god always lead by his word praise the lord god always lead by his word so just like i said now uh we saw koran and dalton trying to fight against moses and say moses it is just you it's always you in it and and you have tried to make yourself something and god was never pleased with that he opened the earth and he swallowed him up there is no competition with god praise the lord i mean there is no competition with god and uh uh you know even the uh the sons of aaron that were called to the priesthood when they were trying to take it as a personal privilege to do things that they were not supposed to do god slid him he was the same one that told moses called aaron and your sons to the priesthood but when he started to do things that were contrary to god's word he got rid of them because god is not in a competition business he in the business of leading people he's in the leadership business not a competition business praise the lord now so we see all of these types in the bible and so you know if you look at the subject of the rejected king and you go back and study that message you know it almost looked like the people rejected samya the emphasis was made but where the emphasis is actually is the rejection of the word it's the rejection of the word now when adam and eve broke the word of god everything went into this other so it was the word that was keeping everything it was the word that was keeping eating the way eden was so adam in governing the earth or governing the garden of eden at that time his his uh uh his authority was coming from the word for him to be successful he had to be subject to the word when they broke the word they lost everything i say that again young people god is not in a competition business god is in a leadership business would it surprise you that was what the the last message that brother brandon preached one of the last is if not the last leadership now so your your and and then seeing that in studying that that was word my mind got cut to this to this subject that we want to talk about a little bit here in revelation chapter 17. and and i will read this to you but it will also bring out the beauty of the gift of a prophet let's take this mark of the beast uh i realized i have two of them here but uh uh they are they are on two different uh subjects let's take the last one in my in my notes here now and the ten horns which there saw where the thin kings which have received no kingdom praise the lord they have received no kingdom as yet but receive power as king one hour with the peace or if we could just receive no power as yet they are not kings because they don't have kingdom praise the lord you see it it takes it takes an eye of inspiration it takes an eye like we would say an ego eye to be able to just read right between the line and understand what is happening there praise the lord they are not kings they didn't have which means they didn't have kingdom their homes didn't have crown they received power like king what is it a detector praise the lord amen it's a dictator not crown king and we know you know if you if you if you look at the political world we see that you know uh uh in in in parts of the world where dictators has ruled you know uh they try to change all all the constitution change everything to to stay in power for as long as they live so but by the year we realize i mean when we get into the study itself you'll be able to see you know some of those some of those things and and and i mean how how they came to power how they were appointed by the roman church to rule over certain cities they were appointed by the church they were influenced into office by the church just to keep the interest of the church praise the lord and we can run down into many many ali with these things and uh so we see here that uh uh uh the holy spirit is kind of for pointing something out when you think about it in the form of leadership god has never ordained a detector praise the lord and and and and and and and a man that is a detector is a man that would rule out of law he would create his own law praise the lord amen he will create his own lord even almighty god our king our prophet our our our praise he subject himself to his own word [Music] praise the lord so in that sense it keeps the word on the throne and not the man if the man is subject to the word it keeps the word is what is governing the man is just an instrument he's just an agent that the word is using but it's the word that is governing the people praise the lord whether it comes to the king or it comes to the prophet or it comes even us to the local church praise the lord the pastor and everyone a subject to the word is the word that is governed is the word that is governing the church we must be able to look at the word and the word alone when we start to create things to make the church to work we're becoming a detector and then one one of the easier way is that to start something that appease to the people that's what the dictator does he do things that we appear to the people the people get happy about it and he use that verity to enslave them but when a man is subject to the word he knows that the people are looking at the word and when he breaks the word they can use the very same word to condemn him are we together so that's that is god's order from the beginning the great antenna spirit coming to time and to start creation to be able to to manifest his attribute he condemns himself into this form called the word the logos paul said by him all things consists without him there was there was nothing that was made so right from the beginning the word has been governing the earth we have in all the trouble today we have with heat and everything is because man in his so-called wise wisdom is going against the lord of god's word praise the lord as long as we keep the word on the throne of our heart our body we have to come in obedience because it was the word that spoke every atoms of your body into existing as long as you keep the word on the throne of your home that home is bound to come in obedience as long as you keep the word before you you are bound to win your fights paul says we that we have to know that everything that is made was made by the word of god so the word has control over everything praise the lord the word has control over everything are we together praise the lord amen and uh i i i was at work and i was i was listening to something and and and meditating and uh and and and and this thought came struck me it came clear and and i appreciated it because uh over and over i've been trying to say it but i i really never got a hold of it in a way that i wanted to say but it came in a way of a medical sense sometimes when a child is born from from from from birth sometimes the child have illness they are certain illness the doctors were now worried about the doctors will say their child will outgrow amen as a child grow they will outgrow their illness as long as you keep them in the right environment and give them the right food you keep them on their medication or whatever it is they will outgrow their illness because as as their cells as their body develop the changes that is taking place in their body you know will will help them to outgrow their illness praise the lord i was just looking at a at a at a documentary it was actually a news feeding and and and of of a little boy that was playing soccer and and and and then he went into a hit and got a concussion as he came out of the coming out of the concussion he started to speak a fluent french and affluent spanish when he never knew spanish in his life never knew spanish never spoke spanish in his life but now he speaks spanish something triggered in his brain that brought our spanish praise the lord so god has placed holiness in you he just needs you to get through the right kind of a trial that we trick of victory it will trick out clean living it will trick our holiness you can't practice it and just like in the natural where a child can outgrow illness in the spiritual we can outgrow the same sickness as we walk in the light as he is in the light we grow into mature christians and those things that bother us just far away there is no magic to it you just got to keep on the authority of the world praise the lord amen mark of the beast here we we read this one also in revelation let's take it also he says i will prove to you that communist is working straight in the hand of almighty god to destroy rome and remember i say this as god's prophet the rush the russian empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the vatican city and destroy it in one hour thus said the lord amen and the bible said that god god took them crew had a man and put them in his hands and there were instruments in his hands to fulfill his will that would be the same thing with nebuchadnezzar praise the lord he ever said he had a dream and and and i mean just telling the dream daniel receiving the dream listening to the dream god trouble one hour the truth about the mouth of that is that because it was a divine inspiration it was something from god it was something that prophecy was titled this was the word of god coming to a pagan king a man that never knew god praise the lord amen now you can see it if you go back to the book of daniel when god gave nebuchadnezzar the dream he gave nebuchadnezzar the dream using an image of god and and brian's and silva but it was an image are we together it was an image just stay with me you would you grab what i'm going with this but in in daniel chapter 8 i think seven or eight when daniel started to receive the interpretation of the dream it came in the form of a lion a leper a bed it was the very same dream that nebuchadnezzar had so what was going to happen here is that that's the reason why in the scripture if you if you watch closely uh in the gospel and also in the writing of paul he talks about the time of the gentiles and the gentile dispensation many times it sounds like the simba is not the same the times of the gentile is more political and the and then and the gentile dispensation is tied to religious prophecy are we together now what i'm bringing out of here is is the one hour that daniel was trouble it was because of the effect of the dream are we together praise the lord question announced this year brother branham take this one we read also from matthew he says now i have to get another scripture here to show you jesus talked about the people that he said some come in an hour in one hour and another and another hour and there was 11 our people and the 11 hour people now you are spiritual read between the lines because i i've got to jump here and and uh come in and 11 hour people he went on i didn't want it to increase i mean just go on with with with all of that but he was also showing how the 11 hour people got the same amount of reward as those that started from the first hour of the day praise the lord amen as those that started from the first hour of the day now let's start there to something you spirit of truth brother branham says here i would rather oh god have a church with 50 people in it in the word of god than to have five thousand out of the word of god he says show god can do more with a man in his will in one hour than he came with a man out of his way in 50 years praise the lord and then if we bring the 11 hour principle again to the church will realize that that's the reason why this last this church is is is uh is is coming to maturity or this last this church is the harvest group praise the lord this last year's church is the harvest group because we realize that the first three churches church ages was the great missionary age the holy ghost fell on the date of pentecost and and and and uh colena's house had an experience brother branham says god had to put persecution on the church to spread the apostles around the world it was the great missionary age now the fourth church age was the persecution age are we together the fourth church age was the persecution age it was it was the the ox anointing where they had to die for their faith praise the lord i mean when we go through little things we cry we complain but they were fair to the lions and burned to the stake in all of that but yet you realize that the seals did not open in that age the mystery of god was not revealed in that age god kept it for the last age praise the lord that's the reason why when we show the position of john he was looking back and then he on us to all the things god was revealing the church edges to him we went through that now so we see here that uh this 11 hour people you know having the same the same reward the same benefit that's the reason why god promised to uh uh bring us back the pentecostal blessing amen restore our how return our hearts back to the faith of the fathers is for us to be able to get the same blessings that they receive at pentecost for us to be get the same blessing the same reward even though we are not burned to the stake even though we are not fair to lions but just for standing for his name in this age god is going to give us the same reward are we together amen that's the reason why god can get a hold of a young man or a young woman and he can have an experience and and i mean they can just they can just uh uh prosper in the word of god and someone that had been sitting in the message for over 50 years they are just stuck into crease and darkness are we together even though they went to brother branham meeting even though they sat there they saw the supernatural praise the lord but the revelation of the world went right over their head the revelation of the word when right over their head it can be very dogmatic about brother branham share this i was seeing the tabernacle i was looking right at his face you hear what he said but you missed the revelation and the young repented heart can prosper in the word of god god can give them so so much balance you know people that saw the healing line the prayer line they can get stuck to the same place and say but i'm saying only 50 person will make it you know what they have done they just locked themselves out no desire to witness no desire to testify because they have already counted the 50 people that will make it and they let themselves out they count the 50 person and they already know the 50 percent or as much as they know they're not they are not part of the 50 person and god can do a quick work in one hour in one hour he can spin your life around praise the lord are we together amen am i making sense of this thing oh i'm just enjoying my own thing praise the lord i like it too when i'm enjoying my own thing it's when i'm not enjoying it that i get afraid praise the lord amen amen now let's take this other one here conference with god this one brother branham is is addressing the code of can you pray with me one hour i want to use this in in and close the thought tonight conference with god he said to his desire disciple wear it they had they had a lot of big meetings was tired perhaps like you are this evening and he said will you just watch with me one hour oh i have got to go yandere and have a conference praise the lord amen now you think about it now jesus was asking his disciples to watch with him one hour so like brother branham said uh in the message i think cruelty of sin he said that the entire decision of the word rested on his shoulder amen he had that free moral agency just like how adam left the word and choose to stay with his wife all of that was resting on jesus decision now and he was asking his disciple to pray pray with me one hour so let's take it in a sense that he had to deal with all of this pressure the bible says his spirit his soul was trouble one hour he had this intense pressure on him praise the lord amen and he had to bottle it the bible said he prayed he cried in agony he prayed he cried until he sweat and his sweat was as taken as blood praise the lord are we together one hour he had to make a choice one hour he had to make a choice praise the lord and you know what happened god left him alone god left him alone he was left to himself it was almost like something waking up and realized his head is gone he was feeling like a human god left him alone one hour one hour you know what it is when you feel alone one hour is too much of a time it's too much of a time are we together praise your lord and god left him alone when you watch with me in one hour oh i have got to go yonder and have a conference i have to go alone the conference was set and the lamb young a beautiful life i just read the other day broadband said he had a right to get married he had a right to choose to raise a family but he said father sanctify me for their sake a young beautiful life 33 praise the lord amen i know as soon as i said 33 everybody started checking their age but it's okay the holy ghost caught you never a life like that never was never will be a life like that the lamb had but now the father said are you willing is your love for your brethren great enough praise the lord it's your love for your brethren is great enough is your love for that sinful stinking word that you were born in do you love them enough to fulfill for fit your life praise the lord you know when he fell and adam came home because when he fell chaos started right away chaos started right away the animals started barking at one another they started running i mean dust i mean everything fell when adam came home and met his wife do you know that adam never said what have you done eve how can you do this praise the lord as soon as he got home he just embraced her the truth is that adam never had no option he never knew of another woman that he could get marital so he can let this one go because all the things in in in in in in in the divorce court or the divorce mind is because we we have other options i don't never have another option when he came home he never blamed his wife he just embraced her his love never changed do you believe that can you believe it that his love never changed he never talked for a second to to to uh to to to investigate now you have to realize that eid fell from grace she fell from grace she was she was feeling condemnation feeling something that she had never felt before and adam was still in this state of innocence oh praise the lord oh my you think about that it's your law for this sinful stinking word that you were born in do you have love do you love them enough to forfeit your life do you love them enough to take their place to bear their sin to the highest crew of death now you you all of these things was what was taking place in one hour all of these things were the toss that was going through his mind the father has left him he feared forsaken he felt lonely lonely as lonely can be praise the lord i know for some of us we have no reason to be lonely but yet we choose to be lonely we create our own loneliness when we have no reason to be lonely because of selfish reason our selfishness is eating us up and we think it's somebody that is making us to feel lonely there could be nothing died that kind of death but him in that conference such a decision was made until blood dropped from his brow he was under a strain the sins of the world was upon him and then he looked into the face of the dolph and said not my will not my will but now be done you just think about it one hour of pressure oh can we have that decision in our heart this evening can you fulfill for faith that little filthy life of yours are you willing to look back into his face and say not my will i'm a drunker but i would drink no more i'm a gambler i'm immoral but i would be the way be that way no more i'm a liar but i will stop it today i'm a fire person but in this conference this evening i look into your face and take like my master who died for me to make my way clear not my will your will if it cost me my home if it cost me my husband my wife my father my mother my fellowship my church membership whatever it cost me in this conference i want to say i say i want your holy spirit in my life i have heard about it i want you in me not mine but yours that's my decision musicians you can come tonight god has called a place not upon some high pinnacle place but a humble little tabernacle about to fall you are having a conference praise the lord now we can have another time and talk about one hour with the beast [Music] but you think about it this man these leaders they had to sell their right knowing that they don't have a they don't have a kingdom they're going to take the title of a king to be detected just to do the bidding of a deceiver [Music] what if i choose i said well okay i i have to protect my my interest in this in this church [Music] and i got to talk to brother dan bernan are you really are you guy you're going to stick with me i'll make you the the assistant pastor i called brother jordan and said hey brother jordan i really need to have a talk with you all just because of my interests this man did not high kingdom but they were going to do the building of the beast [Music] and he made them kings and whatever the beast said that's what they had to do because that was the agreed agreement but think about this other story that the scripture says he had made our kingdom priests unto our god [Music] we gain our kingship by birth because our father is a king and when we gather near birth we are born as prince and princess and as we grow into the kingdom we can exercise the right as a king we don't have to do a bathing just to be able to be in good terms with a person and we can take a title on ourself but it comes as a birth we are willing to strive for the kingdom we are willing to do the bidding of the king we are not seeking athlete interests and fleshly interests and man-made interests we are seeking the bidding of the king not my will but that i be done you think about it tonight while we go to the lord in prayer i don't know where you are but i know that god i have been dealing with your heart about something it's been over a day it has been over a month it's been over a week it's more than an hour change my heart oh god oh [Music] yes change my heart make it ever true [Music] may i be like you let's just sing that one more time change my change my life change my life oh god may i be [Music] me this is what i press change my heart oh make it ever true change my heart may i be like why the musician plays softly listen to me [Music] in the message rejected king brother branham says because saul will not list him because he will not listen to the voice of samuel the prophet [Music] because he will not list him god turned him over [Music] to an evil spirit and that evil spirit was a stubborn spirit because he would not list him god turned him over to an evil spirit [Music] and all saul wanted to do was just to please himself all he sought to do is to please himself [Music] no matter how much the word of god was preached to him no matter how much some your talk you can never listen young people the stubborn spirit is a destructive spirit [Music] it's a destructive spirit but a man that is possessed with that can never see what he's doing is wrong the individual that is possessed with them [Music] is just all about himself everybody is wrong nobody can understand me it is just all about themself is because when god spoke to your heart the first time and you reject the voice of god you can play all the religions sing like an angel dress like a sin but your heart is stubborn you rebel [Music] and it was that spirit a lay saw to his own death that spirit led him from one era to another era to another era to another era to another era until it killed him until he died because he rejected the voice of god [Music] [Music] so a stubborn spirit is a religious spirit [Music] it's a religious spirit it's so convincing [Music] but it's all about pleasing you you are so interested in pleasing yourself that you cannot lay down your life for god's command one hour our lord jesus had to fight his own will [Music] he said no lord no all the opportunity was coming to his mind everything that he could have become in this world [Music] because he reject he rejected the the word of god it came just by on advise samuel just gave him an advice wait for me wait for me impatient [Music] [Music] attitude [Music] [Music] and because his heart was in that rebellious place god could not deal with his heart he could never feel sorry he could never say sorry no matter how many javelin he threw at david he could never say sorry he justified himself for everything that he did [Music] could never come to repentance [Music] but think about this now think about this saul was not lost but that spirit tormented him he could never find joy he could never he could never get to the place of fullness he went from one trouble to another troubling and i mean he was just he was just so tore up [Music] moses never needed one hour he just needed five minutes in the presence of god and i don't know whether [Music] and moses is here tonight [Music] someone i really want to get a hold of [Music] god [Music] let's pray together [Music] and if you feel in your heart tonight you need help there is enough help in this room tonight because the angels of the lord is income about them that fear him [Music] god is willing and ready to help us more than we desire to be helped heavenly father oh god lord we left our house to you tonight [Music] dear god we look in our own lives
