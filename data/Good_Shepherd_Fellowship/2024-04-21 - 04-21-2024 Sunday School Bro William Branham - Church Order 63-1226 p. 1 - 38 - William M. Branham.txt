[Music] [Laughter] [Music] yeah you be ready to turn them off I motion my head do you like that please keep my motion my head to you [Music] [Applause] you Brethren we've called this meeting together here tonight for the purpose of knowing how that operate the Church of the Living God which we believe to be a part of this church I want to first thing I want to uh say that in my travels around the world so far as I know this is one of the most spiritual places where you feel the spirit of God more than any other place I know I had two other places in mind that used to be but so far we we don't uh seem to see those places one of them has went into the organization and the other has U has kind of fallen so uh I was called uh yesterday and was was told me that you all wanted to meeting to ask me these questions concerning your duties in this church and I um that's what I'm here for tonight is and to to set the church or to give to you the things that I think that that is what's substantial to make this church to continue on Brethren I'm sure that you do realize that as I've made this remark about uh this being a spiritual place it isn't the biggest place in the world and it isn't what we have the most singing the most screaming and the most hollering or the most speaking in tongues and things that isn't it but it's the quality of the spirit that's operates here in this Tabernacle and so far I want to command and thank brother Neville and and you Brethren here trustees and deacons and Sun School superintendent and all for for what you have done and helping keeping this us away it's been a long prayer of mine and a desire since a boy to see the church put in order and kept in order now we dedicated the church I told you a little later I had something to talk to you about how to set this thing in order the way it should be run and um you started off uh after leaving here we had ministers and so forth but now brother Neville being just young Among Us come Among Us I thought it'd be better for brother Neville to get better established in the faith before I presented such things as I'm about to do now but now after I find out that he is uh getting well established in the faith and understands what the doctrine is and and has uh played the part of a faithful witness to Christ and holding for what we believe to be the truth I think it's the hour now would be a good time to approach him and among you elders and things of the church that you would take these orders and remember them they're the best of my knowledge before God and then I'm looking to you to carry these things out the way that I'm saying because somebody has to be a head around here you have to have now I'm not trying to Asser Authority or something like that but you see a man or any anything with two heads to it it it doesn't know how to go God never did have two heads to his church he never did it's one head he always dealt into every generation as we've studied through the scriptures there's always one individual that he deals with because you get two many you got two opinions it's got to come to one final absolute and my absolute is the word the Bible and as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the word and I I know you Brothers you kind of look to me to be your absolute to what as long as I follow God as Paul said in the scripture you follow me as I follow Christ and then I'd expect you Brethren at any time that you see me to get away from this scripture to come to me privately and tell me where I'm wrong I don't care if you're one of the trustees or if you're the janitor whoever you are your duty bounds me as a brother in Christ to tell me when I'm wrong scripturally if it's a question let's sit down and solve it out together and that's why you've come I suppose to me tonight brought me in here is because that there's questions here that seems to be questioning you in your mind for the things that I have have here now remember brotherr I don't know there's no name signed on any of these tickets but and they wrote and I can't don't know who wrote them but there are questions that's on your mind and I'm here to answer them the best of my knowledge and remember God is looking to me to see that I stay in the word and I'm looking to you to see that you carry out the word see in this church and keep it spiritual or remember all the forces of of the dark kingdom of Satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow and the Lord and you must be soldiers not just fresh recruits you're age soldiers now I've been trained to fight and Satan will come among you cause you to dispute with one another if you can turn him down just immediately you're Brethren and it's the enemy and we're here to hold a standard in this evening light time that when the world is darken and the whole Church kingdom is going into the Council of churches and pretty soon they'll try to tack a sign on this door you're closed now we're going to have to meet other places because they'll certainly close these churches one of these days if we don't take the mark of the beast and uh we're depending on staying true to god Till Death sets us free and that's what we intend to do now straight to the and I would ask that if ever a time that any of these things come into question that this tape may be played before the members of this church at your meetings or prayer the meeting just before the meeting starts turn this tape on and play it and may the congregation here understand that these men are Duty bound to God is there oath in this church to help hold these principles you may disagree with them and if I let you run it then I disagree with you we've got to have some Source somewhere where there's got to be an ultimate and the best that I know I'm giv it under the Holy Spirit letting him be my ultimate and let this tape be your ultimate on these questions now the first one is how shall the church act towards calls for financial help of for food and clothing what what act what what should the church do now we realize that the church is responsible for its own for our members here of the church we are totally responsible as far as we have needs to supply them with we are responsible for for our own that's steady constant members of the Tabernacle come here and worship with us we are Duty bound to them as our brothers and sisters who have proven to be our members of this Gathering now we realize that there is millions tonight without food without clothing and we would love to be able to help the whole group of them to do everything we could but financially we cannot do that we can't support all the world but we are Duty bound to our own and I think in that and then if we have anything left over that you would want to contribute to people who are not members here of this church something that you want to give to them it should be met between the the board of the deacons the deacons is the one that that has to meet this opposition or this problem rather because that in the Bible when the dispute come up about food and clothing and so forth in the book of Acts they call the apostles in about it they said go look out for yourself uh s a man of honest report and full of the Holy Ghost that they might attend to these things because we will give ourselves continually to the word of of God and in prayer and it isn't the pastor's duty to look out to the for the food and so forth that's supposed to be by the deacons it isn't the trustees it is the Deacon's office to do this and then this should be remember in the Bible they was contributing to their own the Greeks and the and the Jewish where the argument come up that one was getting a little more than the other but it was people who had sold all their goods and had given into the church for its support and then to to be divided out among them equally and there was a little dispute come up and there's where we got our first deacons and that's one of their duties is to do that I think that as our own as our own people uh we should take care of them and it should be turned in any complaint to the chairman of the deacon board and then it should be met by the Deacon board and see what they're able to do about it and all of those things which is clothing and food and financial help or whatever it is should come through the deacons then the deacons when they decide that they are that they are what they're going to do about it then it should be presented then unto the U the treasure to see if the treasure is able at this time to pay this certain amount of Finance or or buy these clothing or whatever it is to that but the the Deacon board should meet on that and it doesn't go to the trustees or to the pastor it's a Deacon's thing altogether now then question number two is it s sufficient to say openly from the pulpit that tongues and interpretations should be done in meeting before the service that's the second question on this uh slip of paper that I have here which is a little card now this would be uh pertaining to the pastor here see because he after all over the spiritual part he's the head of that deacons are a policeman in the church to keep order and to take care of these things and feeding the poor and so forth the trustees are over the finance in the building that's what they to look at but the pastor is over the the supervising of the spiritual part and this would go to you brother nille now there some time ago when the uh order was set the church uh I do believe in speaking in tongues and interpretation and all the fine spiritual gifts that's ordained of God to be in the church but we are living in a day just like it was in the Bible time where the churches now you notice Paul he founded the church at Ephesus the Ephesian Church which is a well-established Church did you notice we believe that Paul and did say so himself that he spoke with many tongues and we know that he had gifts of tongues not ones that he had learned but those who were spiritually given to him because how he speaks it Corinthians there and the same time I'm not just turning in the Bible and reading it for you because it would make our our stay here too long tonight as I don't have too much time and now but just so that you could openly see now uh Paul never one time had to speak to the Ephesian church or to the Roman church or any of those other churches about their spiritual gifts about how to put them in order but he did have to speak to the Corinthians continually about it because they made it an issue all the time and Paul said when he come among them if uh they found out one had a tongue and one had a Psalm and he thanked the Lord for all their fine gifts and things like that and if you notice in the first chapter or two of Corinthians Paul was telling positionally what they were in Christ how he they were positionally in Christ then after he told him and like a father he be to let the whip down on them and say I hear there's contentions among you and I hear that you get drunk at the Lord's table he didn't un christianize them and don't you Brethren do that un christianize them but it's a way they're behaving themselves in the house of God that's where it's said now I would say this that as Paul of old said that when you come together if one speaks let another uh interpret there be no interpreter then hold your peace but if there being an interpreter now I've watched The church here and I've seen you grow up I've seen many spiritual gifts operating among you frankly one I had to come to brother Neville about with a word from the Lord to correct him on something that he was doing and if I if the Lord is the Holy Ghost has made me an overseer of the flock then it's my duty to tell you the truth and I'm very grateful for brother Neville he heeded to the truth I can only say it as he tells me now on this as I noticed your church growing and noticed it and in the church here's the way we had it first and this is the way we we want it again now if you don't watch when babies the first thing a baby does is try to talk when he can't talk he makes a lot of bubble and noise and and so forth but he thinks he's just he can out talk the preacher at that time well we find that not only in the natural life but we find that in the spiritual life also it's a little one and if you try to correct that baby and spank him a little bit because he's gooing and trying to talk you'll ruin the child and you'll hurt him and it's best to let that baby grow a little while until he actually can speak his words right and then tell him when not when Papa's talking or When Mama's talking but when it's appropriate time let him have his say do you understand me now let him talk when his time comes to talk now if I've ever had anything that's been a thorn in my flesh out in the meeting is someone to rise up when I'm speaking and then give a message in tongues and break the spirit I've just come out a meeting in New York and different places to where ministers let that go on time after time and it's nothing but but a confusion see when God is dealing in one line of thought he it would be it would he would be defeating his own purpose if he's trying to get a line of thought to you to the congregation to make an alter calling something budding for instance like this we're sitting at the table talking and we're talking uh about the Lord and Junior runs into the table real quick takes all the attention away from what we're doing and hollers scream out dad mom my my I just hit a home run down the team and we doing all this that and the other and when we're right on a real right down sacred subject now him hitting a home run that's all right at the baseball game that's all right but he's out of horor when he breaks in on the message that we're talking about let him wait till his time comes and then tell us what he did at the baseball game now that's just the same thing we find with gifts today that's the reason God cannot trust too many spiritual giftss with people they don't know how to control them that's what's the matter today the reason we don't have no more than we do and we do find there's a lot of impersonation of spiritual gifts but I don't believe that's so here in our church I'm thankful for that I don't believe it's an impersonation at all I believe we have genuine gifts but we must know how to control those gifts then when you go to doing something good just like you working for a boss and you start out on the first year job and you're willing to take ERS then the boss has confidence in you and will keep raising you up to a higher office all the time now I believe that time is struck the brandom Tabernacle to know what to take the gifts that God gives us that God can trust us with something even greater and what we have got but we cannot uh go along and you see a man that's always had to be tell him and everything and remember the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets says the scripture when you see a man that you have to correct or a woman and that person gets out of order and then you're telling him the scriptural truth then it shows that the spirit that's on him isn't of God because the Bible said the spirit of the prophets are prophesying that's testifying preaching speaking in tongues or whatever it is because tongues interpreted is prophecy so it's subject to to the prophet and the word is the prophet so we we see that it's out of order for a man or woman to jump up and give a message no matter how much they want to do it while a preacher is in the Pulpit now I suggest this for the brandom Tabernacle that being that our our gifts that we find and we have some very fine gifted people here now each one of those gifts are a Ministry of their own they are gifts just like preaching is a gift like healing is a gift like other things are gifts these are gifts they are ministries of their own and each man is commanded to wait on his own Ministry therefore let the brandom Tabernacle be operated like this and in the day today especially this day when we've had so much um I don't want to say this but so much make belief we don't want make belief no man no honest person wants to have a make belief we we don't can't have the real let's not have any at all let's wait till we do get the real I believe you you man would agree with that we don't want nothing make believe brethren we can't start on make believe something and leave in this world we got to have what's real what's genuine if we haven't got it let's wait till we do get it and then say something about it see now I would say let all these men and women who speak in tongues and prophesy and give messages and I I'm believing with you men that they are genuine now the Bible has said prove all things and hold fast to that what's good or with stammer lips and other tongues will I speak to this people this is the rest that I said that they should enter into over in the book of Isaiah now I would suggest this so that the sanctuary will only be ministered by one gift at a time or it brings us straight back in order again of what I'm trying to say if one Speaking let the spirit of the prophets be subject to the prophet do you understand now let those who have a Ministry to the body of Christ and now it's being said now let it be done let those who have a Ministry to the body of Christ wait on their Ministry because it is a Ministry from Christ to the church but you can't all Minister the same time there's got to be one at a time the brandom Tabernacle shall be like this let those who speak with tongues and those who interpret tongues and those have prophecy that's to be given to the church let them come among themselves early in the before the meeting starts let them Gather in an appointed room and wait on the ministry of the Lord as the pastor has to do himself before he comes in to the audience he must take the Bible study in the quietness of his room in the spirit and be anointed to come out before the audience to speak if he doesn't he's going to be confused when he gets out there let each man and each woman with a spiritual gift come before the Lord and being that the pastor has a single Ministry he is a prophet the Eng English word a preacher means a prophet that's a fourth T of the word let those who have Ministries that has to be part of someone else like one to speak with tongues and another to interpret they wait together on their Ministry they cannot stay in a private study and speak in tongues and then come tell the other what he said because he'd had both tongues and interpretation now if he has that very well we want it to receive it like that and we want the church to benefit by these gifts that's in our church God sent him to us and it's we want our church to benefit by these spiritual gifts so let the man who speaks with tongues and the one who interprets and the one who prophesies let them come together before the the church ever meets let them meet in a room to themselves waiting on the ministry of the Lord to the church is it do [Music]
