========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I did this, me, I, mine, my my denomination, me, this, establish themselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What are we preaching about? Ourselves or the kingdom of God? &gt;&gt; Establish the word of God. Take out the unbelief &gt;&gt; and establish the kingdom of God in a man's heart. And a kingdom of God cannot be established in a man's heart unless God made that man thus. &gt;&gt; He cannot be established in a And remember the deceitful part that man think that it's right. &gt;&gt; There is a way that seemth right unto a man. Every intellectual being seems right. As I told you a few Sundays ago when I stood by my dying baby and Satan standing there and said, "There's your daddy died in your arms the other night. There's your wife laying down there in a in a morg. And here's your baby going. And you asked him to answer you and you pulled your he pulled a shade down over you now. And yet he's a good God. And yet you said he was a healer. And you who are standing for what you said was right. You're wrong. Oh, every reason, every mental faculty had to agree that it was right. And he was right that much. So was he right when he told Eve? Your eyes will be open and you'll know right from wrong and you'll be as gods that way knowing right from wrong because God didn't let them see themselves yet that they were naked. So they know they would know right from wrong and he was right. But you see it was contrary &gt;&gt; to the word of God. And so does ministers in seminaries learning man-made theology. It may seem right. It may be a good understanding of the thing, but it's wrong. We don't have to understand it. We believe it because God said it so, and that settles it for &gt;&gt; the whole thing. Will you believe it? Oh, how Eve lusted to have a PhD. How she lusted to be smarter than what she was. Notice how much alike man and his wife. I know it's a man and wife, both naked, and the Garden of Eden, God's Eden. Now, I'm going to close. I said I going to hold just a few minutes. Look, watch now. It's closing. Compare this. Now, how much alike that man and his wife, both in God's Eden, without one stitch of clothes on them, and knew it not. For why didn't they know it? For they were veiled to their senses of nakedness by the holy veil of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; They could look right at each other and they didn't know that they were naked. &gt;&gt; They were veiled with the Holy Spirit of holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were veiled. &gt;&gt; God's veil yet today can look and not lust. &gt;&gt; They turn their head. It's a holy veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Holy veil. God had their eyes. They were both one was man and the other was woman. And they did not know they were naked because the holiness of God kept their eyes veiled. Notice God hid their conscience &gt;&gt; from from sin by the holy veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. We had some time lay on that a few minutes. Look here. For he the worshipper once purged. Hebrews the worshipper once purged has no more conscience of sin. &gt;&gt; Sin has passed from him. &gt;&gt; I heard brother Neville say this morning someone I've been asking him, "Why didn't I preach on the Holy Ghost? Why didn't I do this? Here it is." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is an action in you. It's a life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not an emotion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not some sort of a fleshly evidence, but it is a person, Jesus Christ, the word of God established in your heart to quicken every word of this age. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Watch the Holy Ghost in action. Not so much in demonstrations, but in action. What it does according to the word. Notice now the Holy Spirit of God's holy word had a man and woman naked and didn't know it. How beautiful life of the word, the seed. The word God said there is a tree in the midst of the garden. The woman and in the midst of the garden is this tree. Don't even touch it. For the day you eat thereof, that day you die. They were wholly veiled from it. Didn't know nothing about it. Darede to touch it. They were wholly veiled. They were safe in God's provision. &gt;&gt; They were alive. &gt;&gt; They had no death around them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They had perfect love one for the other. Perfect life forever. They had perfect love, perfect understanding of the love of God. They had God's word and kept it. And they were alive and safe in God's Eden &gt;&gt; with no death at all around. Then Satan got Eve to listen to his gospel of theology, the gospel of knowledge, higher schooling, higher ethics, better civilization, higher education, and so forth. Then when he got the her to stop and listen to him a minute to his reasonings, which we are commanded to cast down, when he got her to listen to it, now look here, the church is so and so, it's been established for so long. We're one of the oldest churches in the country. the mayor of the city go, "No, I don't care what it is." See, if it's against God's word, be against it. &gt;&gt; That's your enemy. Anything that's against the word is your enemy. &gt;&gt; Everything that's far the word is your brother, is a part of you. Notice, she pulled off the holy veil to see what sex really was. Compare that. What lust really would do. She pulled the veil from off her eye. The holy thing that God had put over her eyes. She wanted knowledge to know what it was all about. So she pulled the veil off to see what it was all about. She listened to the devil. And notice what a place it put her in. They have done the same in each age thereafter. always taking the intellectual side and has now built a kingdom of Satan knowledge his seed that he sowed and has took the world to be an Eden of death. Now notice now look at Revelation 3. The lady is seeing church age. You think it in your mind. In other words, she Eve is Satan's queen. &gt;&gt; See, Satan the serpent got to Eve before Adam got to her. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So he begiled her. See, so Satan the serpent was the husband of Eve before Adam ever knew him. He begiled her. The Bible said he did. And she knows she was naked then. Now look at the the lady seeing church age. She Eve is sitting as Satan's queen. She's rich in worldly goods, blind, naked again, and don't know it. &gt;&gt; Just like it was in God's Eden. But now, not because the holy veil is over her face, but the lust veil &gt;&gt; that she took off God's holy veil and put on a veil of knowledge for lust and now she has a lust veil that she is blind to it being sin. She's naked on the street and don't know it. She's a prostitute on the street. Women with these shorts on and God's sight is a prostitute and don't know it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Notice, take our women. Now, if you want to see what condition the church is in, watch the way women are acting. She always represents the church. In Satan's Eden of sin and unbelief, a religious perversion, perverted kingdom. Instead of taking God's word, they've took the intellectual learning of man. Instead of taking the church, they took the organization and they're bringing it to one great head. Now notice, perverted from innocence. Don't miss this. Now, the church has been with this lust veil on. Notice what it's done to her. It's it's perverted her from innocence to knowledge. &gt;&gt; The holy veil, she was innocent. with the lust veiled. She's knowledge. She knows it's pleasant. She knows what it does. See the fruit a tree to be desired. Make him one wise. See, she is perverted from innocent to knowledge, from holiness to filth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And lust, and from life to death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This kingdom has to die. This kingdom shall die. The God of heaven will destroy it from the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; Notice in this perversion, it's become from a man to a woman and from a woman to a man and don't know it. A very good product of Satan's Eden. If you'll watch the streets today at our modern people, notice it was Eve that Satan used to make Adam sin by her power of lust. Now, the same doing the same thing today. Notice bobbed hair, painted facing, sexily dressed. &gt;&gt; See, she does that and don't know that every one of those things is contrary to the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To cut her hair makes her a dishonorable woman, a prostitute. &gt;&gt; To wear shorts touch her disgracefully, put sexy dresses on her makes her a prostitute. &gt;&gt; And she don't know it. &gt;&gt; Not because of the holiness of God, because of lust of Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She caused her, she causes her Adam to lust for her. She took off the clothes that God dressed her in back in Eden for her journey through the this wilderness. She took them off. She stripped herself down when God had her wrapped all over in skins. She's be to shave a little off each time. Now she's back to where she was at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Now she's got her Adam to wearing her underneath clothes. &gt;&gt; A man put on them little old looking shorts. Amen. You get out your I don't think there's much man to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the biggest I know of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, she's got her perverted Adam to act like she see &gt;&gt; wearing her underneath clothes. She's seen what she could do out in her when she took off all of her clothes, but her underneath ones. &gt;&gt; That's the shorts, of course, that's a woman's underneath clothes. &gt;&gt; And here her, Adam is wearing them now. which according to God's original word is an abomination &gt;&gt; for a woman to put on a garment pertains to a man and a man to put on a garment pertains to a woman &gt;&gt; from the original word. Think of it now. He now wears her bangs also. He combs them down, puts a curler in them. Some of the most sickly sights I've ever seen in my life is some of those kids out here today with their bangs combed down like this and colored bleached hair with some kind of a proxide something and bleach and rolling in curlers making bangs. You big &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a horrible thing to say from the pull pit, but judgment begins at the house of God. &gt;&gt; You don't even know where you're a man or woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I understand that our United States Army is coming out next in shorts. &gt;&gt; That's right. See what the perversion is? &gt;&gt; It's a woman's clothes. &gt;&gt; Wears her bangs. The other day I was over Howard Johnson's. Not this one here, but one on the road going out. And I just sat back in the mason. Here come a little boy along his mouth open. And he had dark hair here and it combed it over this way and put a roller in it and curled it up around top of his eyes. Looking out top of his eyes going around. If I ever seen a perversion, see, he wouldn't believe it. He could prove maybe he was male, but in his spirit he's female. &gt;&gt; He don't know what side of the house he belongs on. &gt;&gt; That's all right. &gt;&gt; How perverted. That's what Satan does. &gt;&gt; He perverts the nations. He perverts the church. He perverts the people. &gt;&gt; He is a deceiver, a perverter of the original truth. God made a man a man. &gt;&gt; He made a woman a woman and he dressed them different. And he meant for them to stay that way and to act that way. One is finished, the other is masculine. He separated Adam in the Garden of Eden and did this. Separated Eve from him. Now wears her bangs. She cuts her hair like his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he tries to wear his like hers. &gt;&gt; She wears his outside clothes and he wears her inside clothes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that sounds sacrilegious, but I don't mean it that way. &gt;&gt; It's an absolute gospel truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't know it, then there's something wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're either blind or never been on the streets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she thinks and he thinks that it's right. They're getting along somewhere. &gt;&gt; Women says, "Well, it's so hot. &gt;&gt; The old Apache Indians out there make you shame yourself. More heat they get, the more clothes they put on. Keep the sun off of them. Oh, make it sweat so they can have an air conditioner as they walk. They stand around in the sun. You couldn't stand nothing. You blister and burn." But you see it's what we call higher education. Modern science has produced this. Oh my. There she is naked in Lady Oia and don't know it. She was naked in Eden. You see the two kingdoms alike. One is of sin and death. The other is life and righteousness. &gt;&gt; And there she was veiled with a holy veil. They were both naked. They didn't know it. They didn't know nothing about because they veiled with God's spirit. And here are their veil with lust and they look at one another to see Adam could look at Eve and didn't know she was naked. But now with this lust veil, she doesn't realize she's naked, but she does it under this lust veil to make man look at her. &gt;&gt; It's the only thing she can do it for. You don't believe it, but you do it anyhow. And man, look. And he found out you got so much attraction that he come around put some of your clothes on himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a perversion. What a age. What a time. We're how deceitful it is. Oh, all these things and don't know it. A perfect perverted spirit is in the man. He's veiled from the lust of Satan and the woman is too. It's a satonic spirit of a great society. See, they don't know, but they're organization. Women with shorts on belongs to an organization. Men dressed like that is on an organization. I'll give you the abbreviation of it. BSS, Big Sister Society. So that's what they belong to. Come out there a big sister of society without a little big old naughty looking dirty looking thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I I man you may differ me at this but that's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have been perverted and don't know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not don't act like a man no more. &gt;&gt; See coming so soft and they would be nothing to them anymore. &gt;&gt; Men and women too. They are a society. There's an organization. Why? John next door wore short. So why can't I? Luella wanted me to wear them because uh John wore them next door. And well, if if Susie Jane can wear them, so can Martha Jane wear them or Susie Lou, whoever who her name is. See, see, it's a society. It's an organization. You spiritually belong to it and don't know it. &gt;&gt; And if that's so, and we see it so, so are you blinded. &gt;&gt; You're blinded to these denominations that Satan has twisted you into. And it's a perversion of God's original word and his kingdom and his plan for his children. &gt;&gt; Satan has twisted man and women into these things. And they don't know it. A perverted. No longer a son of God. Bangs hanging down his face and pair of shorts on trucking down the street. A son of God. Deacon in a church. A pastor in a pullpit. Now that ain't a son of God. &gt;&gt; He'd never come through God's stinking filter. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't have them women's clothes on. Amen. &gt;&gt; You sure wouldn't neither would she have the man's clothes on. &gt;&gt; See, it's not a son of God. It's a son of Satan &gt;&gt; and a daughter of Satan. Hard thing to say. Satan has succeeded in perverting and taking over this world and making it his kingdom that man was put on by free moral agency to choose for themselves what kind of life they desired. &gt;&gt; That shows what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hey, your voice. You know what? Your action speaks so loud it drowns your voice. &gt;&gt; Let me go to a man say, "Oh, we're all Christians. We belong in church and script teases hanging all over his office." Here's what he told me. I know better. &gt;&gt; So would you. Let a woman say she's a Christian with short hair. &gt;&gt; You know better than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Let her say she's a Christian wearing paint and makeup and shorts and say she's a Christian. You know better than that. The word of God teaches you better than that. &gt;&gt; The word says she can't do it and be a Christian. &gt;&gt; She's even dishonorable and everything. How's God going to put a dishonorable thing in his kingdom? No sir. Not at all. No sir. Their selves shows their desire. You can't get a dove to eat with a buzzard. &gt;&gt; Not at all. A dove don't have any gall. He can't eat that old Karen. If you took a bite of it, it would kill him and he knows it. But a buzzard can eat most anything he wants to. He's got plenty of gall. So then you find out that's the way it is with the world today. Same thing. They're naked, blind, and don't know it. Satan did it by the woman's lust for knowledge, for sex, which she chose by her own choosing. Now notice, it was Eve that led Adam to the wrong. &gt;&gt; And it was a woman that took off her clothes before her Adam took off his. See, it's the woman always, it's always been, it still is the same way. It's the church that leads the man astray. It's the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that leads to man that want to be a son of God. It's the woman, the church, not the Bible, God. For the Bible is man. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. The word was made flesh and he was a man. &gt;&gt; The Bible is man. The church is woman. &gt;&gt; See, it isn't the church. The Bible that leads the man astray. It's the church that leads him astray. &gt;&gt; It's the church he went naked with, not the Bible. See, no. Indeed, the Bible tells him he's naked. Yes, sir. Now notice how by sex, desire of sex, she lusted for knowledge to know what was this and how whether this fruit was good or not. And she did it. God will take it back someday. Oh, &gt;&gt; by a man. &gt;&gt; It was surrendered by a woman, but it was redeemed by a man. &gt;&gt; The man Jesus Christ, which is the word. &gt;&gt; And then what is it? Notice in closing here, not long ago, I made this statement. I got about four or five more pages in there, but I of scriptures and things I want to refer to. But listen, let's close in saying this. Remember here not long ago I was teaching you on the seven trumpets, the feast of trumpets and so forth. &gt;&gt; And I said there is an eighth day festival. &gt;&gt; So the seventh day would be the last. That'd be the millennium. But there is an eighth day festival &gt;&gt; which if it was the eth and it's only seven days wouldn't make it the first day again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come right back to first day. Then after the millennium is over, then there will be an established Eden again. &gt;&gt; God's great kingdom will be taken back because Jesus fought it out with Satan in the Garden of Gethsemane and won back the Eden which is gone to prepare in heaven to return again. Up in heaven, he said, "Let not your hearts be troubled." But when he was shorter, he said, "You, you Jews, you believe in God. Now I know I got a bad name." He says, "They say of this other, but you believe in God. And as you believe in God, we [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
