[12:07] I just
[12:09] wonder a long time ago it was wrong for
[12:12] a woman to put on a garment that
[12:14] pertains to a
[12:16] man G the Bible said it's an abomination
[12:20] in the sight of God hallelujah you
[12:23] Methodist I want to fire one at you when
[12:26] John Smith preached his last sermon a
[12:29] sharp one 4
[12:30] hours so old they packed him to the
[12:33] platform and he said oh I don't know
[12:37] what's going to happen even the
[12:39] daughters of the Methodist Church are
[12:41] wearing rings on their fingers what
[12:43] about now with a bathing suit on
[12:45] stretched out on a beach before a bunch
[12:46] of man that's you
[12:49] Methodist all right you Baptist a little
[12:53] prayer one time now and then and John
[12:56] Smith the founder of the Baptist Church
[13:00] pray until his eyes would swell shut and
[13:05] his wife would have to lead him to the
[13:07] table of the morning to feed him his
[13:09] breakfast shame on you
[13:12] Baptist and you Methodist that don't
[13:14] believe in Divine
[13:16] Healing when John Smith I stood for this
[13:19] Shrine not long ago one day he was
[13:21] riding his horse and it fell and broke
[13:23] its leg and he got off the horse and he
[13:26] took a bottle of AO from his pocket and
[13:29] anointed the
[13:30] harsh and rolled away on
[13:34] it you preached that in the Methodist
[13:37] Church they'll throw you out the
[13:40] door oh you did run well what hindered
[13:46] you standing out long go to a great
[13:48] Presbyterian man who was sitting by my
[13:50] side in some cult in
[13:53] California he said what do you think of
[13:55] that he didn't know me I said it's all
[13:57] right he said you know one time the
[13:59] Presbyterian Church was the Dominic
[14:01] Church on the west
[14:03] coast he said but then in come the
[14:06] Christian Science and just tore it to
[14:09] pieces and now here comes this man's
[14:11] tearing the Christian Science to
[14:14] pieces I said then if you would have
[14:17] given the children the bread of life
[14:22] they wouldn't know went after such stuff
[14:24] as
[14:25] that but hungry children will eat from a
[14:29] garbage
[14:30] can the world's hungry today for the
[14:34] word of the Living God oh you people
[14:39] what you need you pastors is feed your
[14:43] sheep right with the word of the Living
[14:48] God then he kept bringing word oh how
[14:51] your children does this how he must feel
[14:54] imagine you being a teacher and have to
[14:56] go to the very your maker and report on
[15:00] his own child the discipline but now
[15:04] what if the child was a good child what
[15:07] if the child was just about the father's
[15:10] business then how gracious the tutor was
[15:13] he'd come and say oh kind
[15:16] sir your child is at just a chip off the
[15:20] old
[15:21] block he's just like you he's just about
[15:26] your business oh you'll never never find
[15:29] a better businessman for your kingdom
[15:32] here than that child how the father must
[15:35] swell out oh that's my
[15:37] boy oh yes he's my son how that the holy
[15:42] spirit standing in the presence of God
[15:45] and says this man he is a real son he's
[15:51] about your business how do we say we
[15:53] about his business this is his program
[15:56] preach the word
[15:59] I'll be lifted up I'll draw a man to me
[16:02] how that he must feel great and feel
[16:06] happy then you know what happened if
[16:09] that son never did behave itself it
[16:12] never was no more than just an outcast
[16:16] bar that's right now I you know I'm a
[16:19] still a little bit of calvinist but I I
[16:21] believe if you're born to a child of God
[16:24] you could be a disobedient child and
[16:26] you'll Rel lose all your reward
[16:29] and you'll never be no more than just an
[16:31] ordinary Baptist Pentecostal Nazarene or
[16:34] whatever you
[16:35] are but if you'll be up and
[16:38] doing if you'll be
[16:41] obedient and a real
[16:44] child now the Lutheran when you first
[16:47] found out the just shall live by faith
[16:49] you made a Doctrine out of it it's right
[16:53] and you Methodist as soon as John Wesley
[16:55] come along the pillar of fire as it
[16:57] moved
[16:59] they built under it and when John Wesley
[17:01] come along you discovered the new birth
[17:03] or what they call sanctification the
[17:05] second definite work of Grace that was
[17:07] all right so was justification right but
[17:10] as soon as you found out sanctification
[17:11] you draw a little line all your leaders
[17:14] did after the death of Wesley and ASB
[17:18] and so forth and then you made a
[17:20] Doctrine out of it and you draw a border
[17:23] line God just moved the pillar far right
[17:25] out the Pentecostal founded the
[17:28] restoration of the gifts they begin to
[17:30] speak in tongues you made a Doctrine out
[17:32] of it and you put your period down now
[17:35] the holy spirit's moving right on off
[17:37] and leaving you that's right oh brother
[17:39] when you isolate yourself from the rest
[17:42] of the Believers God will move
[17:45] away you've got to love one another this
[17:49] will all men know that you're are my
[17:51] disciples when you have love one for the
[17:54] other when the Methodist and the Baptist
[17:57] and the L Luther and the Pentecostal can
[18:00] stand arm in arm and March forward
[18:03] you'll see one of the mightiest
[18:04] outpourings of the spirit of God that
[18:07] you ever seen the devil don't care as
[18:09] long as we're shooting at one another oh
[18:12] go ahead you just fight kill yourselves
[18:14] but let us unite in one big front watch
[18:17] what happens then watch what goes on now
[18:21] if this boy was a correct boy and he was
[18:24] obedient and he was industrious and he
[18:26] he liked to do the things of father had
[18:28] left for him to do then the tutor come
[18:31] and said oh he's a great boy then on a
[18:33] certain day when the boy become of age
[18:36] which the church ought to have been a
[18:37] long time ago this boy was brought out
[18:41] into a public place and had a ro placed
[18:45] on a beautiful Road and all the
[18:49] roundabout was called in now listen Clos
[18:52] and closing and all the people was
[18:55] gathered in at the front of the gate
[18:57] usually taking place place he went up to
[18:59] the front of the Gate of the city and
[19:02] there he set his boy up on a high place
[19:05] and he put him on a robe and you
[19:07] preachers here I'm talking of the
[19:09] placing of a son you know in the Bible
[19:12] now in Galatians or Ephesians 1:5 for
[19:17] God has predestinated us unto the
[19:20] adoption or the placing of sons by Jesus
[19:23] Christ now he was a son to begin with
[19:28] but now he's so obedient let him be
[19:30] whatever denomination that has nothing
[19:32] to do with it it's obedience to the word
[19:36] obedience to God and then he was placed
[19:39] on this High seat and there was a great
[19:42] celebration and the father
[19:45] adopted his own son that had been in his
[19:48] family all these years had adopted him
[19:50] into his family in other words he had
[19:54] placed him give him his
[19:57] position in the family and then after
[20:01] that the boy's name was just as good on
[20:04] a check as his daddy's was for he was
[20:07] positionally placed now my Pentecostal
[20:10] Brethren Baptist Methodist and
[20:12] Presbyterian whatever you are do you see
[20:15] where we're sharp
[20:17] today do you see we are fussing so much
[20:20] about our denomination about our presage
[20:23] and about our societies God can't do
[20:26] nothing with us we're children but oh
[20:29] May the day
[20:32] hasten when we can be set out before the
[20:36] public and robed in the power of his
[20:42] righteousness that our words our prayers
[20:45] will heal the sick and our preaching
[20:48] will save the lost and the great signs
[20:50] and wonders of the Bible will be
[20:52] restored back to the church
[20:54] again when we break down our little
[20:57] petty Je juvenile differences that's
[21:00] when God will do this notice he was
[21:04] positionally placed and then he become a
[21:07] full-fledged son then his name is good
[21:11] then that's the way with the church if
[21:14] we could get away from our little
[21:15] differences and come to Christ and
[21:17] forget about the outside world or forget
[21:20] about our denominations and so forth and
[21:22] be obedient children and be about the
[21:25] father's business to get Soul SA sa and
[21:28] to do the things of God after a while
[21:31] God will set us to one side and he'll
[21:34] anoint us with the Holy Ghost and then
[21:38] we're positionally placed in his kingdom
[21:41] some has the gifts of wisdom some has
[21:44] knowledge some has Gifts of tongues some
[21:47] preaches the gospel some are prophets
[21:50] and other gifts but now God is moving
[21:53] the gifts in the
[21:55] church I might as well say it as some on
[21:58] my heart see I don't want to hurt you
[22:01] brother I don't want to hurt you sister
[22:04] but the Pentecostal church and you Full
[22:06] Gospel people these gifts you don't know
[22:09] how to control them there are gifts here
[22:12] all right but you're going wild with
[22:14] them put them in their place look the
[22:16] first gift is wisdom what good it go to
[22:19] do you to have knowledge if you don't
[22:21] know have wisdom to know how to control
[22:23] your
[22:24] knowledge what good does it do you to
[22:26] speak with tongues if you don't have Wis
[22:28] is them to know when how and to place it
[22:31] right see what I mean what good does it
[22:34] do to preach Divine Healing when it just
[22:36] goes to pieces you don't know what I've
[22:38] said I met two classes of people in my
[22:40] life and that is the fundamental and the
[22:43] Pentecostal the fundamental positionally
[22:46] knows what they are but they haven't got
[22:49] any faith the word's never took root yet
[22:51] it's never come to life but positionally
[22:54] they know where they are the
[22:56] Pentecostals got the faith but they
[22:58] don't know who they are it's just like a
[23:01] man's got money in a bank don't know how
[23:03] to write a check and the other can write
[23:04] a check and ain't got no money in the
[23:05] bank if you could ever get those
[23:10] together oh God give us either a
[23:14] spiritual fundamental church or a
[23:16] fundamental Pentecostal
[23:19] Church you got lots of faith but you
[23:22] just don't know how to place it it just
[23:24] runs wide that way it brings more
[23:26] reproach and it does good
[23:28] place it in the Bible this is the
[23:31] blueprint not what people want but what
[23:34] God
[23:36] wants line up with his program that's
[23:39] what's the difference that's why we're
[23:41] not going on the way we should be
[23:44] friends now while they were standing
[23:48] there notice that when in the presence
[23:52] of God now in the Old Testament God
[23:56] never did ask man to do anything L he'
[23:59] do it
[24:00] himself when man was sentenced to death
[24:03] to Die the only way God could redeem him
[24:06] has come down in flesh and take his
[24:08] place that's the reason I preached the
[24:10] way I did last night Christ is more than
[24:13] a man he's God he had to come down and
[24:16] be clothed in flesh in order to taste in
[24:19] he couldn't send another individual he
[24:21] wouldn't be just in doing so he had to
[24:23] come himself and he overshadowed the
[24:26] Virgin and created a blood sell it
[24:28] brought forth the Sun and God dwelt in
[24:31] the sun tabernacled here on Earth he was
[24:35] Emmanuel not a
[24:38] prophet but God With
[24:42] Us God was in Christ reconciling the
[24:45] world to himself it's the only way he
[24:48] could test taste sin and death was to be
[24:51] made Marty like man the kinsman redeemer
[24:55] of Ruth that I preached on so much
[24:57] across the
[24:58] as you probably read the sermons oh he
[25:01] had to be a Kinsman to be a redeemer and
[25:04] the only way that God could ever be a
[25:07] redeemer he had become kin folks to us
[25:11] and he become flesh and dwelt Among Us
[25:14] he are kin folks he was a flesh man like
[25:18] I am like you are but God dwelt in him
[25:20] to suffer and feel taste his in five
[25:23] senses like we are he become a redeemer
[25:27] then when was standing there on Mount
[25:30] Transfiguration God was showing to the
[25:32] world what he had asked man to do back
[25:35] there under the adoption or placing of
[25:37] sons Peter got all
[25:39] excited usually men do when they're in
[25:41] the presence of
[25:43] Supernatural usually they can control
[25:46] themselves because they're creatures of
[25:48] the earth and yet they're creatures of
[25:50] Heaven too but that for taste just runs
[25:53] them wild that's what's happened to the
[25:55] Pentecostal Church see that for T you
[25:58] don't know how to control yourself you
[25:59] get all out of
[26:00] reason you don't know how to place those
[26:03] gifts of tongues those interpretations
[26:05] while the preacher is speaking sometimes
[26:07] you raise your up and speak right while
[26:08] the preacher is speaking that's contrary
[26:10] to the
[26:11] Bible and you say oh God gave a message
[26:13] of this it's fresher than the Bible no
[26:16] it's
[26:17] not that your words will fail and
[26:20] everything else will fail but the Bible
[26:22] said if there be any spiritual or profit
[26:24] among you let him acknowledge what I
[26:26] write is the Commandments of God and if
[26:29] an angel from heaven would preach any
[26:30] other gospel in that which has been
[26:32] preached let him be a
[26:35] cursed you see what I mean so if you try
[26:37] to shake hands with pre people to get
[26:39] them into the kingdom of God you're
[26:41] wrong they're bned in the kingdom of God
[26:43] by the Holy Ghost they're not baptized
[26:46] Face Forward backward sprinkled forward
[26:48] in one name or the other they are barned
[26:50] of the spirit of God into the kingdom of
[26:54] God Peter was excited he said Lord let's
[26:58] build three
[27:00] Tabernacles we'll build one for Moses
[27:02] and all wants to keep the law Moses
[27:04] represented the law all that wants to
[27:07] keep the law the Commandments and don't
[27:08] eat meat and so forth let them do
