uh i think the lord has been so good and remains so good to us and we want to thank him for his faithfulness and everything that he's doing but i i just felt in my heart this evening that uh we should just bring ourselves before the lord bring all our needless pains to him with the privilege that we have to call upon the name of the lord let make use of it all the time praise the lord so i will start off here by reading psalm chapter 103 bless the lord all my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquity who healeth all thy diseases but branham says we have to remember it's an all amen who redeemeth that life from destruction we'll crown of thee with loving kindness and with ten of mercy we'll satisfy that mouth with good things so that that youth is renewed like an ego praise the lord and that will remind us that uh what the lord have started doing with us in this assembly started with hours of prayers a lot of service of counseling concentration and putting a lot of emphasis of getting back to the world and all of that i just feel you know like brother branham said he says a new church in the dedication of the branham tabernacle he talks about it in light of the church building but is now on it in light of the church building even when god starts blessing the people and instead having some sense of growth just like every teenagers do church do the same and we start changing our attitudes we start getting starchy we start you know picking on habits that we never used to pick on so i just feel like we should bring ourselves before the lord we should constantly remind ourselves where he took us from and where he's taking us toll praise the lord we have a service coming this weekend saturday night and sunday morning with brother clay farmer we trust in that the lord will give us an outpouring he will be able to bless us praise the lord you see it is now only to bring a good preacher to time it's not only to have wonderful preaching but god's desire is for us to bear fruits praise the lord is for us to bear fruit it's for is for the world to leave these pages and start to take a hold of our body that's god's desire that's what god wants to achieve in his people whether the young people whether the elderly he wants his word to be made flesh in us so

fold this building and yet the world is not having effect in our lives we come and fill this building and we don't and our attraction is not to god our attraction is just to a man to a preacher or to a name [Music] we want our attraction to be to god [Music] we want to look unto jesus the altar and the finisher of our faith we are not looking onto how good we are we are not looking onto how long we've been believing don't look onto what we are doing because it's so easy for the enemy to take our eyes from looking onto him and we start looking at ourselves and looking at how much we have achieved and looking at how far we have come and we're now looking to him but let's look tonight unto jesus [Music] how many times we have been reminded that the worshiper is never on an examination it's a sacrifice [Music] and all the devil want us to do is to examine our lives examine our thoughts examine what good we are doing as zombie how well we are addressing the zombies and all the things that we are achieving when the worshiper is never on the examination [Music] let's look at our sacrifice tonight [Music] let's look at our sacrifice tonight [Music] let's look unto jesus let's behold the lamb the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the word can we fill him with our minds tonight can he occupy us our thoughts tonight [Music] can he be the one that is the desire of our house

our bibles hallelujah amen we just want to share a few things with you tonight on this prayer meeting night it's in john chapter 16. um it's in john chapter 16 let's read verse 13. but make an emphasis on this verse in the message the god verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth is come when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself i want you to underline that in your mind he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear there shall he speak and he will show you things to come praise the lord he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father have a mind therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you a little wine and ye shall not see me and again a little wine and yeah shall i see me because i go to the father okay i just added that verse there because i want us to see something over in genesis 22 the lord bless you you can have your seat as i said this is a prayer meeting the preacher will preach for you on sunday let me just do my little shirt amen praise the lord let me just do my little shear i made a statement on sunday after the service and uh which of course that is something i've shared with you before and but what happened is that when i went home i decided to go back and look at it in in the in the scripture and then and just like every time the bible will surprise you amen when you look at it then then then you start to see it clearer amen i bet you look at it another time you see it more clearly praise the lord hallelujah so uh i want to i want to just look at a little bit on this principle of a little while but uh you know after the service i was talking with my friend brother daley by the way that uh he flew out this morning to flagstaff to preach for brother brother dale smith and uh [Music] and then he will be there with uh brother doug baker and then spend some time in that area for a while just spoke to him on my way coming here he thank you for this for having him on sunday and he wanted to make sure that i sent my his greetings to to you all praise the lord amen now uh uh he was dwelling on abraham's sacrifice on sunday we'll do a little review and [Music] and look at some few things that uh that are in the scripture uh as i was thinking about this i was thinking how to bring it and when i look in the bible uh uh there's only there uh imagine the gospel jesus uh make reference to uh as jonah was three days and three nights the wheel belly so the son of man will stay in the heart of the earth three days and three nights so there is there is this thing of just looking at jonah only having the three days and three nights uh type in the scripture but it's not only jonah there are many places if you remember we talked about rahab how she told the spies to go and spend three days and three nights and that was also a type of the resurrection and there is i just remember that uh there was a picture i was going to show you a drawing i was going to show you but uh uh yeah okay it's okay praise the lord but you will you will realize that there is there is uh there is no place in the bible there have a perfect picture of calvary then genesis 22 praise the lord and genesis 22 do not only have the picture of calvary but they also have the picture of the resurrection because you must we must realize that that was the thing that drove abraham to the mountain is to see the resurrection abraham wanted to see the the same effect of the resurrection that he experienced in his body he was looking forward to see the same thing in isaac's body abraham never went to the mountain with any fear or any doubt in his mind he was more eager he was eager and anxious to kill him because he believed that god would raise him up amen praise the lord amen and uh so we will we will go back to genesis 22. there are just few things i want to show you uh uh just for an hesitation tonight and then uh we will we will pray and go home just to be able to uh wake up your spiritual appetite for this weekend so we see here that i mean but daily preach all through this so we will not uh go over words here but uh we realize one thing i would want you to also remember in your mind that god never wanted isaac what god wanted was abraham god never wanted isaac god wanted abraham and it's a principle when when your loved one is going through something take for example that is a parent and children relationship if the children is going through something that has wake up something in you i'm afraid they will do something wrong god allowed there to deal with their fear in you whether it's your wife or whether it's your husband when it gets to the place where is is uh is is concerning to you and you and you be coming oh god lord i pray you help them lord i pray you help them it's not about that person it's about you praise the lord i mean it's not your appealing to god constantly appealing that would make god to do what he want to do he already know what he wants to do he created a scene to help you to see an area in your life i believe that was one of the reason why abraham never took his wife because it was not about sarah he came to the revelation that it was about him and i believe also that's the reason why the scripture intentionally used this word god did tempt abraham that that is the attracting word that shows that it was about abraham and it was not about isaac praise the lord are we together and we and we read here that uh uh abraham verse three abraham arose early in the morning and saw that his eyes and he took uh two of his younger men with him and isaac his son and cleave the wolf for the burnt orphan and rose up in the wind now verse 4 will envelop our three days and three nights praise the lord now the reason why the reason why the three days and three night emphasis is net is not greatly fixed to this is because the three days comes before the sacrifice so it looks like it's not is not seen but it's a design of the holy spirit because in god's mind the works were finished from the foundation of the word are we together so then on the third day abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place far off and then he said to the young man about here with the eyes and eye and the leg would go yeah i'm there to worship and we will come again praise the lord we will come again now so if you if you look at that you will realize the other abraham made a promise and then what what what i want to show you here tonight is that it looks like i will have to open mine uh my bible here to help myself out i'll open my my notes here now what i want to show you tonight is is that right here in genesis 22 if you look closely you will see that [Music] uh praise the lord look at verse 9 let's look at verse 9. verse 8 abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and he came to the place which god had tore him off and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and lay him on the altar upon the wood that was the last time the bible mention isaac bound him and lay him on the wood that was the last time the bible mentioned isaac in this story sure which is a perfect type of calvary praise the lord and uh and then from right there uh uh you know isaac is bound he's on the wall and and abraham stretched for his hand and took the knife and then the angel dealing with abraham and all of that praise the lord are we together now verse 19 will also tell us here i mentioned that on sunday so abraham returned his young men i thought abraham said i and the lead will go and return but the bible says abraham return without mentioning isaac sure now that does not mean that abraham and isaac did not come back but the holy spirit is intentionally removing isaac out of the text because that's how it's going to play in the fulfillment this is just a type praise the lord because after jesus paid the price on calvary to god his work was finished he no longer had a public ministry jesus never went to the sahendra's council he never went to the synagogues to preach he never went to the temple to pray because he did not had a public ministry the only ones he dared was the believers the sins am i right so here the holy spirit is intentionally moving isaac out of the text because the picture will be right in the fulfillment praise the lord now the next time isaac will be mentioned will be genesis 24. praise the lord genesis 24 verse 4. verse 3 abraham speaking i will make this word by the law thy thy god by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanite among whom adword but thou shalt go on to my country and to my kindred to take a wife onto my son isaac now isaac is mentioned here but his person is not there praise the lord another thing about this chapter 24 that is also beautiful is that the bible says when abraham verse 1 was worth striking in age the lord has blessed abraham with all things and abraham said unto his other seven of his house the rule left over all that he had put i pray thee the hand honor my time you will realize that this seven name is not mentioned all through the text praise the lord there is one scriptural reason why we say it's elaiza there was one scriptural reason why brother branham said it was eliezer you will not find eliezer or through the text praise the lord the reason why is proving that it's elijah is chapter 15. when abraham was telling god that one of my house one of my seven that was born in my house for him to be a hearse for me eliezer that's when the name was mentioned but remember we have just read in john chapter 16 when he the holy ghost will come amen he will not speak of himself he will not speak of himself and go check it study it the name eliezer means comforter here the father is now instructing his seven his faithful seven to go and get a bribe so it has been the holy ghost in every age that's been looking for the bride the holy ghost in every age has been using men to look for the bride praise the lord and you see where the devil gets the people makes up is that the the the the the they see they identify the fall in love with the man and then they leave the working of the holy ghost he will not speak of himself that's the reason why there's no true messenger that will come and say i'm the messenger no he will come fulfilling what the word says and the people that would believe that word will identify him with that promise because when he the holy ghost is come he will do everything that i've commanded him to do but he will now speak of himself praise the lord so year the father is mentioned the next time isaac will be mentioned will be when he sees rebecca or when rebecca sees him in the field sure that's the next time he will be mentioned in the text praise the lord so you see that uh i was i was just i was fellowshipping with my friend to the house and we were we were talking about this you know he's he says i really didn't see it i said well that was just something that attracted me to it and then i started looking at it very closely you know because uh just like brother branham said you know is it's all playing out there it's it's it's written in the word praise the lord that's how uh a scriptural uh uh a scriptural messenger is identified is by the scripture praise the lord is by the scripture and then when you look in in uh in genesis 24 also the father called his seven eliezer and when you read you start to read you realize right from the beginning the bible talks about uh how when this 7 was about to take his trip he took candles and the bible says he took ten candles praise the lord and it looks like when you read true it looks like eliza went on this joining asset solo mission with which made one man mission but if you look closely in a text he was accompanied by men but yet the holy spirit designed it that the bible never says abraham called eliza and his men no the commission was given to eliezer amen the commission was given to him but yet he took faithful men that helped him alone to go and get this bride praise the lord two times the bible mentioned it let me see if i can find it so you see a commission like paul says over there how he was jealous over the church with godly jealousy and he was desiring to expose the church to christ as a chess virgin that was a commission that was given to to the holy ghost but yet he choose men throughout the ages and with every messenger that came there were faithful men that stood with him to be able to carry out the promise praise the lord are we together verse 32 and the man came into the house and then gathered his candles and gave straw and providence for the camel and water to wash his feet and the man's feet that were with him verse 59. and they send away rebecca their sister and her nurse and abraham seven and his men so i mean daily in the church ages brother brennan made emphasis of faithful man he gave an example of someone like timothy that's too faithfully with paul and uh you know men does too faithfully and that uh uh example like elisha he was faithful is to uh with the message of elijah and and all of that he talks about how faithful man will take this word praise the lord and carry it to the coming of the lord now so you see there is the the the the commission the message is given to the messenger but you see along the way the message also gather faithful men right to be able to fulfill the commission so you see the holy spirit design it in a way that when we look into the text of the scripture there is no way we can argue with what god has been doing throughout all the ages praise the lord you see that's the reason why the it has to move from a one-man ministry to a body ministry amen god will always bring that man as a wave shift before the people but then it will become above the ministry because that's the reason why uh the apostle paul taught us about the fightful ministry that is that is there there's another thing that was on my mind also to share with you uh but i will keep it for another day praise the lord and i will keep it for another day because the reason why i got into this is that we have to realize just like we spoke last week what manner of love that the father have bestowed upon us that we can be called the children of god and john said it does not yet appear what we shall be but when we see him we shall be like him praise the lord the the the the emphasis emphasis there is that there's a church word that is waiting to see him after the resurrection right but there is an elected people that are longing to see him every day of their lives because that's the thing that changed us praise the lord that's the thing that changed us to be like him is not our completion is not the physical side but to be like him christ the word praise the lord so that's the way we see him like you look in abraham's uh uh joining where brennan makes uh you know uh expression like that in we have heard and now we see he says there were different ways that god did appear to abraham remember when he appeared when we see him every time he appears and that's the same thing every time he appears in the scripture every time the holy spirit can be able to show christ in the scripture that's the thing that changed us [Music] praise the lord i mean it's not it's not to be able to look for you know the uh uh amazing things in the scripture just to blow your mind just keep your mind together if your mind is blown i mean you might not carry out that word right right your mind is blown you'll be foolish oh wow oh wow you know we get but is to be able to appreciate him you see him it brings it home it brings it home because that is god's secret for the changing of our body that is his secret that is the thing that overcomes the word right praise the lord you have to remember it's not what we overcome it's how to overcome it's now what is how praise the lord because the more he's appearing in the scripture and the more he's appearing in your daily life you can be able to recognize christ in the things that is happening around you the more victory it gives you praise the lord the more i vindicate his presence around you more you increase your trust your faith in him because you can see it lord i know that was i know i know that that was you i just love it when you do it it makes it more real to you it's not a mental thing it's not it's a reality you are living with it i don't have to convince you i don't have to convince you praise the lord i don't have to convince you amen i mean it would be it would be crazy for the person to live and you know to to try to convince everybody around them that they love their wife praise the lord sure amen but she's not complaining because we are enjoying it praise the lord i mean she's now if she's running out of the house it's obvious everybody knows there is fire in the house that is the thing that's that's where john emphasis was just listening to a message for you that brother bram says when he came out of the island of patmos he was so consumed by the things that he saw the way jesus will work in his future church if the people can only see it this is little children your faith overcome the word is to be able to see him right and that's the thing the devil fights against he tries to blur our vision if we can see the pastor if we can see the prophet if we can see this other ministry there and we can see that other brother and see this other person he's trying to blur our vision because the scripture talks about the perfect liberty looking into the perfect liberty the things we look at changes our life the lord it's it's just it's right there it's right there it's right there it's lying right there in the word praise lord looking into the perfect liberty we have time to look at that also how how that you know god designed it that way just like the brazing serpent just look don't fight against the serpent don't be afraid of the abide just look as you keep your eyes they will keep going back if you keep looking at them they keep coming closely praise the lord it just don't only keep them away but they also heal you of their bite praise the lord what the devil would do is to is to remind you of the symptoms that you are feeling and as long as your mind is on the symptoms your mind will be on the animal that bites you because you are thinking about how it hurts how i fed it is a connection the word the word of god will work for you when you can see it since this is homegoing time the rapture is right around us it's right around us it's right around us we have to make this world work for us and as much as we appreciate the great things that god has done in our generation word want to be made flesh in you god want to bring you to a personal experience a personal experience where you can be able to identify yourself in scripture right you can say god has put a garment of praise on me because i don't have the spirit of heaviness praise the lord if you feed i mean depressed that's all you need just go find a government of praise it's going to work it works very well [Laughter] just find a garment of praise i mean we can get we can get excited we can you know we can bring things out of the scripture i mean every time we come to the house of god i mean when we come in and our hearts is ready i mean god will speak to us we can preach amazing message but if it is just for an excitement then we are missing the mark but you see when the people comes because they want to see him in that expectation of seeing god i want to see him i want him to speak to me i mean a five-minute message can break a revival year because everybody will go home with an effect of the world on their heart thank you lord thank you what i was looking for god really spoke to me tonight praise the lord but you see if you can only see god speaking to somebody and now speaking to you then you know exactly what is happening you are listening to the evangelist that is in the room praise the lord if nothing good was said in the in the message if the preacher just stood there and he make you sleepy the problem is not the preacher you have the problem you have the problem because even if the preacher don't have his you know his message quotes together and he can sing his thought together only the reading of the scripture that scripture he read that was beautiful yes sir i mean that's that's the place that uh we are coming to that's the place where the bride is right that's the place where the bride is that's the place where the message has turned from the messenger amen like the prophecy the prophecy has turned from the messenger to the prophet or to the message or the attraction that's the way he said it the attraction is no longer on the man but to the message because the message is the releasing of christ is the releasing of christ all that denominational did all through the ages were to bound christ keep christ from the people and just give them dogmas creeds you know if they can form to certain things without the experience of christ the message has come to release christ to take christ from the pages of the bible praise the lord that's what we are looking forward to that's there's uh that's that's what we are putting our energy behind uh uh you know that that that christ will be released among the people right when that happened the work becomes easy for the pastor praise the lord because the people have the word they know how to go to the world to address their needs sure i mean all the ones you just just said and where is it in the world just tell them i'm dealing with this what we say in the scripture where did the prophet say that and as if you can give it to them i mean they can walk the devil with that thing they will just walk the devil yeah okay yeah okay thank you pastor god bless you praise the lord will the lord bless you tonight the lord bless you tonight thank you for coming and uh i just wanted to spend this time with you in and remind you of these things uh that uh they uh they are very interesting things very very interesting things are happening i mean even even in this local assembly they are very interesting things that are happening you see [Music] the devil want to take advantage of setting things you know and and uh you know and we keeping our eyes on those things and trusting that the lord will will just we just help us praise the lord amen let's let's not let's not slack praise the lord let's not slack i was listening to brother branham a man running away from the presence of the lord everything in this life is a responsibility if you leave your house and drive here you are responsible for what happened in this building praise the lord the way we order our life we are responsible for it he says to everything there is a responsibility right and sometimes not seeing how much we are responsible that's why sometimes we become negligent sure praise the lord you don't we don't realize how much the service tonight depended on your presence when we got down to pray i mean the the service was depending on your prayer so you just don't sit there and and blow your mind away and go shopping we have a responsibility and our responsibility is to bring christ in our midst it's our responsibility each and every one of us are responsible for that yes absolutely that's how we that's why we have to keep the right attitude we have to come pray up if you can't make it a service on time to pray stop praying when you are coming praise the lord don't spend all the time fussing and then when you get right to the church door then uh then i mean you will just stay in that moon you keep fussing with yourself you keep blaming yourself you keep you know uh uh or the devil knows how to use that praise the lord i'm i'm of a very strong conviction that the lord want to do great things in our mess you know god only trusts people that are responsible if you are not responsible he can give you spiritual things the prophet god said long prayers should be done to our house yes you know sometimes people will think you know prayer meeting legends let's just rock the whole night with prayer meeting there are times for that there are times for that but when we come like this on wednesday night you know uh and we call it a prayer service is is just to be able to you know just gather ourselves believing that we are praying home believing that we are remembering the church home and then when we come that few minutes we just come to just put a flame on it and let it bless it's not to be uh you know dragging you down and and let's pray let's pray let's pray let's pray no sleeping let's pray let's pray like we are in our auction center you lord the lord tonight praise the lord i believe it was a wonderful service on on sunday the last two services has been great uh he's been giving me some time to to rest also and and some time to study there was there was a talk that kind of a breakup for my heart and i'm trusting that law will help us when we bring it this scripture has always puzzled me i've always thought about it what was behind it but i think the lord helped me to see a little bit now out of it you know when elisha cried to elijah my father my father the houseman of israel the chariot of his israel and the houseman thereof so if the lord keep us and bless us who would like to talk on that you know would like to talk on how god uh make us powerhouse or talk on god's powerhouse for every age you know god's powerhouse and i believe that's what this bride is that's why the prophet of god said every every er all the devil weapon is against this bride that's right because she's the powerhouse she is the powerhouse so if the lord bless us pray for me i'll be praying for you but let's come this weekend musicians you can come up let's come this weekend and uh uh and enjoy and enjoy the lord again monday we will come together and and fellowship you know uh please monday
