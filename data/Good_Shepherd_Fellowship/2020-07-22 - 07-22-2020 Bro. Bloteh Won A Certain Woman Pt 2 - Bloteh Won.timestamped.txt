[27:30] praise the lord because uh he was the
[27:33] special one
[27:35] that showed himself in our midst through
[27:38] the word and
[27:39] through the service we are so
[27:42] grateful praise the lord there are few
[27:45] things that stuck
[27:46] out to me during the service i will
[27:48] that's what i want to talk about tonight
[27:50] and maybe use something
[27:54] one of them for the for the little bible
[27:57] studies
[27:58] we will call it that way uh i will be
[28:02] capping up on something that i preach a
[28:05] couple of wednesdays ago
[28:08] and uh
[28:11] by the way brother farmer asked me to
[28:14] bring his greetings
[28:16] and he appreciate the hospitality that
[28:18] you gave him
[28:20] so you want to
[28:22] [Music]
[28:23] say that he got back home safely that's
[28:26] what he said
[28:28] and uh
[28:31] he uh looking forward another time if
[28:34] the lord will lead him this way
[28:37] praise the lord so we thank the lord for
[28:40] that
[28:42] um one of the things
[28:45] that stood out to me was uh uh the tip
[28:49] we play
[28:50] the tip we played it if uh
[28:53] uh some of you
[28:56] uh that don't know brother
[28:59] uh but one you will know that
[29:03] uh or for those that know him
[29:08] too you will know that i mean when he
[29:11] got up dancing and all of that
[29:14] it was not actually his makeup
[29:17] you know you would know that it was not
[29:19] his makeup
[29:20] uh he's uh he's a kind of a private man
[29:24] in some way you know but
[29:28] i just believe that was the lord and
[29:30] then one of the things that caught
[29:32] my my mind too was that on the tip we
[29:35] play
[29:36] brother brandon begins that tape talking
[29:39] about dancing
[29:40] in the spirit he began that tip talking
[29:43] about
[29:44] when he when he he was very critical of
[29:47] people dancing in church
[29:49] he said he was very critical he couldn't
[29:52] he couldn't really affect it together
[29:53] when people get
[29:54] emotionally movingly aborted and all of
[29:57] that
[29:57] well you have to know he's he's from the
[30:00] baptist background
[30:01] and so uh he he was very critical of
[30:05] that
[30:06] he said until uh one day in his own
[30:10] tabernacle
[30:11] there was a lady that was uh was singing
[30:15] a special
[30:16] also but she got down to the dancing
[30:18] floor with her dancing shoes on
[30:21] praising the lord and he he said he sat
[30:24] back and he started thinking how can she
[30:27] do that in the house of the lord you
[30:29] know he was just thinking about that
[30:31] and trying to you know place it in the
[30:34] scripture and all of that
[30:36] and he says before he realized he
[30:38] himself he was
[30:40] on the floor dancing with the woman in
[30:42] the spirit
[30:43] praise the lord so i saw something like
[30:47] that with
[30:47] brother prater when we went to liberia
[30:51] i can still remember we were down in
[30:53] hebel having a
[30:54] service there that night and it was an
[30:57] evening
[30:58] you know no light we are using lanterns
[31:01] and
[31:03] and after the service the same started
[31:06] singing
[31:06] i'll see you in the rapture you know and
[31:10] it's not it's not the you know it's not
[31:13] just
[31:13] the chorus the chorus in a sense
[31:17] the the uh as one singing it as a
[31:21] special
[31:22] you know uh with the kind of uh
[31:25] instrument that they play they are very
[31:28] fast sinking people
[31:29] so instead of sinking and i see you in
[31:32] the rapture you know
[31:33] and then he took the tambourine he got
[31:35] he got preaching he done preaching that
[31:37] night
[31:37] he took the tamarind and i saw him
[31:40] knocking the timber in before i knew
[31:42] his feet was left from under him and he
[31:44] was all over the place
[31:47] praise the lord amen you cannot
[31:50] impersonate that
[31:51] you can never impersonate someone
[31:54] dancing
[31:54] in the spirit if you try to do like them
[31:57] you will hurt yourself
[32:00] because when the lord get a hold of a
[32:02] person
[32:03] that's what happened that was one of the
[32:05] things that stood out to me in the
[32:06] service
[32:07] you know to realize that brother branham
[32:09] just spoke on that
[32:11] you know in that tip that we're
[32:13] listening to
[32:14] and yeah we said at the end of the
[32:15] service the lord kind of blessed
[32:17] us with that praise the lord
[32:21] and uh
[32:24] and the next thing that stood out to me
[32:29] in the in the service would pretty much
[32:32] be something i would want to to go back
[32:36] to
[32:38] tonight so uh
[32:43] sister faith if you help me just put up
[32:45] that quote
[32:47] uh have there from only believe that was
[32:50] the message we're listening to
[32:52] we believe before we read the scripture
[32:54] tonight i just want to read that quote
[32:56] because that's where
[32:58] my inspiration or my encouragement my
[33:01] bible said whatever the law would lead
[33:03] us to do tonight
[33:04] this is where we were taken from brother
[33:06] branham says yeah he says now
[33:09] put your hands down this was right
[33:12] in the prayer line when he was about
[33:14] getting in the prayer line
[33:16] or getting to pray for the sick let me
[33:18] call it like that
[33:19] he says put your hands down now
[33:22] what did that little woman do
[33:26] she touched his garment she got down
[33:30] there
[33:31] too late to get a prayer card
[33:35] we did say he said in our language
[33:38] if we would compare jesus meeting
[33:42] with our meeting we would say she got
[33:44] there too late to get a prayer card
[33:48] but she touched his government
[33:51] she got healed just the same
[33:56] as the little girl
[33:59] got her spirit drew back that was jairus
[34:02] daughter
[34:05] but the woman got healed before jairus
[34:08] daughter
[34:10] but in the way that brother branham is
[34:12] saying a year he's
[34:13] he's comparing something because you
[34:16] have to realize
[34:17] jairos intentionally went to call jesus
[34:22] because his daughter was not well
[34:25] and this woman in the crowd when jesus
[34:28] was going in
[34:29] you know and and i mean in the crowd she
[34:32] pressed her way
[34:34] to touch so brother branham is comparing
[34:37] uh jesus praying for jairus daughter
[34:41] which of course by the laying on of
[34:44] hands
[34:45] or calling her spirit back to her body
[34:48] he's comparing the same
[34:50] with the woman that live leap out
[34:53] by faith to touch his garment he says
[34:56] the same with jairus
[34:58] daughter got a result the woman also got
[35:01] a result
[35:03] praise the lord whether
[35:06] he lay hands on her or
[35:10] whether she touched him
[35:13] they was both jews or
[35:17] jewish so whether she touched him

[39:18] so let's go back to that quote again
[39:21] then we will we will get going tonight
[39:25] praise the lord the lord has promised to
[39:27] be our help
[39:28] so we know he would definitely help us
[39:30] brother branham said yeah
[39:32] this is the thing that caught my
[39:33] attention now you you just think about
[39:35] it
[39:36] we we're listening to the tape and we
[39:38] write in uh
[39:40] about in the prayer line and and just
[39:43] like i said every one of us
[39:44] paying attention because i listened to
[39:47] the entire tip through the night
[39:49] when i got home and uh
[39:54] but i never caught that until during the
[39:57] service because
[39:58] like i said there was such an atmosphere
[40:00] that was created here
[40:02] and i would want to use that and
[40:05] encourage you
[40:06] that when we are playing tapes for the
[40:09] sunday
[40:10] school it is not just because
[40:14] we don't have no subject for sunday
[40:16] school
[40:17] just like i said on sunday those tapes
[40:21] the benefit of those tapes is the
[40:23] atmosphere that they carry
[40:28] they are they are teaching materials in
[40:31] those steps
[40:32] they are things that when you listen
[40:35] and and train yourself to constantly
[40:38] listening to brother branham
[40:39] there are things that you would pick up
[40:42] they are things
[40:43] that uh uh i mean that i i've had that i
[40:46] don't know whether
[40:47] uh people have experienced that but
[40:50] brother farmer was also telling me
[40:52] you know something like that you know
[40:54] you you you you
[40:56] you listening to a tip it looks like you
[40:58] have heard something and you show it's
[40:59] on the tape
[41:00] you go back you play it you you can't
[41:02] find it
[41:03] you know he says wow but i thought he
[41:05] said that you know i had one of those
[41:07] things one night
[41:09] and i just couldn't sleep i had to play
[41:11] it and play it
[41:12] go back and read word for word but but
[41:16] so i just want to encourage you whether
[41:18] you are home
[41:20] or whether you are you are in the
[41:22] building
[41:23] whenever we are playing the uh the tape
[41:26] for
[41:27] sunday school concentrate
[41:32] listing we don't get to play an entire
[41:35] message
[41:36] uh uh we uh uh just
[41:40] uh play a portion for that time of the
[41:44] sunday school but
[41:45] there is a reason why uh we we feel led
[41:48] to go that way
[41:50] and and most of the tips sometimes that
[41:52] we will
[41:53] we will ask brother jordan to play is
[41:55] it's a tape where
[41:56] sometimes we are getting the inspiration
[41:59] from
[42:00] that we try to preach a message so if
[42:02] you go back and listen to those tapes
[42:04] you realize that uh you know we are
[42:07] trying to stay
[42:08] just in line with the scriptures just in
[42:12] line
[42:12] with what the messenger has taught us
[42:15] so we encourage you uh
[42:18] you can play tips at home i you know uh
[42:21] you know
[42:22] you hear people i don't come to church
[42:24] to listen to table i can play them home
[42:26] and sometimes those people that says
[42:27] those things never play tapes
[42:31] they never play tips
[42:35] and i just think it's an arrogant spirit
[42:37] if a person says that and behave like
[42:42] that
[42:45] now so i'm sitting there and i'm
[42:47] listening
[42:48] and uh uh another thing again i will go
[42:51] over to say
[42:52] uh the uh we
[42:55] we all know now that is by law
[42:58] that we have to wear match now in
[43:01] minnesota
[43:02] you know is is now by law the governor
[43:06] has passed that
[43:07] past that so we have to
[43:10] we have to guide ourself as we go about
[43:15] and
[43:17] [Music]
[43:19] you know so i mean thank god that we
[43:23] try to require ourselves to do it as a
[43:26] church
[43:27] before is it have now become
[43:31] a statement that we have to
[43:35] we have to wear max i got out of the gas
[43:38] station this morning
[43:39] and i just saw you know max is required
[43:42] right at the pump
[43:43] i said max is required to pump gas
[43:48] you know i did i never i didn't yet you
[43:51] know i didn't
[43:52] even though i heard it on on the news
[43:54] that people were going to
[43:56] to you know the governor was thinking to
[43:59] to to
[44:00] talk about it and then so
[44:04] i was going inside to get something so i
[44:06] took my max and i wore
[44:07] in you know and just like that so we
[44:09] just want to
[44:11] remind you that it is now something that
[44:14] is
[44:14] you know instructed by elijah where is
[44:18] your max
[44:20] okay go and the beacons will give you
[44:22] one
[44:25] so this is what caught my attention
[44:30] brother branham says yeah he says
[44:33] they was both jewish
[44:37] that caught my attention you know why i
[44:40] caught my attention
[44:41] because when i was preaching the message
[44:44] on
[44:44] the setting woman i tapped the woman
[44:48] as a gentile and the reason why
[44:52] i type her as a gentile it is because
[44:56] of what leviticus said
[44:59] so let's turn to the book of leviticus
[45:02] let's go
[45:02] over the notes so that caught my
[45:04] attention
[45:07] praise the lord
[45:10] and i just wrote i just wrote a phrase
[45:13] then i said i have to look at this
[45:15] because brother branham used this over
[45:18] and over most of the time in the prayer
[45:21] line
[45:21] he has never associated
[45:25] whether a jew or the gentile or the
[45:27] samaritan he had never associated
[45:30] so when when when he said that on the
[45:33] tape
[45:33] it caught my attention i see i have to
[45:37] look at this close
[45:38] so let's look at that tonight leviticus
[45:40] chapter 15.
[45:48] leviticus chapter 15.
[46:00] now this this was the reason this was
[46:02] our inspiration
[46:04] while we talked and and again
[46:07] uh you'll see in many places where
[46:09] brother branham talks about
[46:11] god using the gift
[46:14] and the individual using the gift
[46:18] he types it in both ways
[46:22] brother branham says when when when when
[46:25] jesus
[46:26] went to the the
[46:30] the tomb of lazarus he went there by
[46:34] a vision it was god that was using the
[46:37] gift
[46:38] he went there by the vision and he told
[46:40] the disciples
[46:41] lazarus slipped he went there and he
[46:44] said lazarus
[46:45] come forth and lazarus came forth listen
[46:48] to the brother branham says
[46:49] he called lazarus from
[46:53] from death and that you never even left
[46:56] him
[47:00] that you never even left him he said but
[47:03] that woman
[47:04] when she touched so she was the one that
[47:07] was using the gift
[47:10] she was the one that was pulling on the
[47:12] gift
[47:14] when she touched the ham of his garment
[47:17] he fell weak
[47:23] but when he said lazarus come forth
[47:26] and lazarus came i mean
[47:30] nothing happened to him because he went
[47:32] there by a vision
[47:40] he went there by the vision and and like
[47:42] brother branham said
[47:43] if he never said lazarus come forth it
[47:46] was going to be a general resurrection
[47:48] and and and and many what comes from the
[47:50] grave and all the dead sins who have
[47:52] come from the grave
[47:53] and he will have not stayed fair weak
[47:57] why because it was god that was using
[48:00] the gift
[48:04] so when you use the gift
[48:08] when you put on the gift
[48:12] when when you are inspired
[48:15] it draws strength from god
[48:20] praise the lord now so you will see many
[48:23] places where brother branham talks about
[48:26] that
[48:26] and and in the way that he talks about
[48:30] it
[48:31] you you realize that
[48:34] many times when he talks about uh
[48:39] the roma centering
[48:43] okay he talks about a roman centurion
[48:45] which was a gentile
[48:47] he talks about the gentile faith the
[48:49] expression of the gentile faith
[48:54] just speak a word my seven would be
[48:57] healed
[48:58] if i touched the ham of his garment i
[49:00] would be
[49:01] you know he says like like paul says the
[49:04] the the jews secret signs
[49:07] the greek are after knowledge so the
[49:10] jews
[49:11] the the the jews the love sign so
[49:14] brother branham talks about the laying
[49:16] on of hands the law of the laying on of
[49:18] hands
[49:18] but when he compared with the gentile
[49:21] faith well speak the word
[49:22] just say a word my seven will be healed
[49:25] so most of the time brother branham put
[49:27] the gentile faith
[49:29] to an action are we together
[49:34] now so you see uh uh uh that that woman
[49:38] expressing saying in her heart if i
[49:41] touch the ham of his garment okay
[49:42] leviticus chapter 15 tonight
[49:45] i know i have a way of just going in
[49:47] cycles
[49:48] and the time will be gone let's read
[49:50] verse 19
[49:52] we just pick up some few verses verse 19
[49:56] and if a woman have an issue
[50:00] and her issue in her flesh
[50:04] be blood she shall be put
[50:08] apart seven days
[50:11] and whosoever touched her shall be
[50:14] unclean until
[50:18] the evening praise the lord
[50:22] let's drop down verse 25.
[50:28] and if a woman have an issue
[50:32] of her blood for
[50:36] of a blood many days out of
[50:39] the time of her separation which means
[50:43] after she have crossed the seven days
[50:46] when she noticed it she should separate
[50:48] herself for seven days
[50:50] but after she has crossed the seven days
[50:53] which is
[50:54] the time of separation and she continued
[50:56] to experience
[50:58] this blood issue or
[51:01] if it runs beyond the time of her
[51:04] separation
[51:05] all the days of her issue of
[51:10] her uncleanness shall be as the days
[51:14] of her separation she shall be unclean
[51:17] what is saying here is that the moment
[51:19] she goes
[51:20] across that seventh day now she will
[51:23] stay unclean
[51:25] until they can figure out what is
[51:27] happening
[51:30] praise the lord if she
[51:33] if she feels uh she has an issue of
[51:36] blood
[51:37] the first day she must separate herself
[51:40] after that first day
[51:42] now in our term we would say current
[51:43] thing she was guaranteeing herself
[51:45] so after after the seven days
[51:49] she can step out she's free if the blood
[51:52] issue does not continue
[51:54] but if the blood issue continues after
[51:57] the seven days she must stay
[52:01] separated she must stay quarantined
[52:04] until they can figure out what is going
[52:07] on with her
[52:10] praise the lord if it is just only one
[52:13] day it happens
[52:14] she have to stay until seventh days
[52:17] there is something
[52:18] you you will notice in the book of
[52:19] leviticus when you read it
[52:21] is either seven days you will have to
[52:25] separate yourself
[52:27] and the time that you will be accepted
[52:30] in the congregation was the evening time
[52:34] it's a very beautiful thing when you
[52:36] read uncleanness in
[52:38] in the book of leviticus wherever the
[52:40] form of uncleanness
[52:42] you have to be separated for seven days
[52:44] if the priest will pronounce
[52:46] you to be clean it has to be in the
[52:48] evening time
[52:49] so evening time message has brought some
[52:51] cleaning for us
[52:52] [Laughter]
[52:54] amen
[52:59] it was one of the things i enjoy
[53:00] studying the book of leviticus
[53:03] it's been a while so so this was the
[53:06] thing that
[53:07] caught my attention if this woman
[53:11] had a blood issue for 12 years
[53:14] that's what the bible is saying
[53:18] amen if she had a blood issue for 12
[53:22] years
[53:22] you will see there are places also in a
[53:25] message where brother branham
[53:27] in in the prayer line he descended
[53:31] the needs of some women compare it with
[53:34] that woman
[53:34] he typed it to to menopause that i can
[53:37] show you the code there's a place where
[53:38] he
[53:39] he types that in as well and and and
[53:42] and all of that now you we we would take
[53:45] that as
[53:46] an inspiration of the prophet
[53:50] praise the lord because there's a
[53:52] difference like i've said to you before
[53:53] there's a difference
[53:55] between interpretation and inspiration
[54:00] as as a minister as a preacher i have
[54:04] the right to inspiration
[54:07] because that's what the scripture says
[54:10] praise the lord
[54:11] that the scripture is given by
[54:13] inspiration
[54:15] that the man of god should be equipped
[54:18] but i'm not an interpreter of the
[54:22] scripture
[54:24] there is one person that has a legal
[54:26] right to
[54:27] interpret the scripture is given to the
[54:30] prophets
[54:34] so i can use this leviticus
[54:37] uh 15 that we have just read i can
[54:40] preach a message from there
[54:42] another person can come and preach
[54:44] another message
[54:45] and use a different title it's all
[54:47] inspiration
[54:51] praise the lord but when a person starts
[54:54] to say
[54:55] the scripture means this
[54:58] then we have to pay attention
[55:03] we have to pay attention because that
[55:05] that now becomes interpretation
[55:08] praise the lord so uh uh just
[55:11] i'm just kind of reminding you i know we
[55:14] talked about it before
[55:16] now so uh reading this
[55:22] like i said looking at the woman
[55:25] having a blood issue for 12 years
[55:29] looking at what leviticus said
[55:32] if she was an obedient jewish woman
[55:37] she would have to separate herself
[55:42] are you seeing the picture
[55:45] praise the lord i don't know whether
[55:49] it went over your head when i was
[55:50] preaching it but that's what i was
[55:52] saying
[55:54] if she was uh had this blood issue for
[55:57] 12 years
[55:59] now the gentiles did not knew that
[56:02] custom
[56:03] they never had the lord of moses
[56:06] so the way a gentile woman would treat
[56:10] her blood issue is different from the
[56:12] way
[56:13] a jewish woman would treat her blood
[56:15] issue
[56:18] are we together
[56:21] praise the lord i mean things are
[56:24] crossing my head and i don't want to go
[56:26] into it amen
[56:27] i want to stay right here i don't know
[56:30] what
[56:30] is your questions that are crossing my
[56:32] head but
[56:34] i want to stay right here praise the
[56:35] lord amen
[56:37] now so you can see where
[56:41] i i got that inspiration from
[56:44] if the blood issue is 12 years and she
[56:47] should be separated
[56:49] then i don't believe that she can be a
[56:52] an israelite or a jewish woman she has
[56:55] to be a gentile
[56:56] and moreover she's she's having a gentle
[56:59] attitude because the jewish attitude
[57:03] is to fall before him and says master
[57:07] touch me that's that's the jewish
[57:10] approach
[57:13] the gentile approach is expressing it by
[57:16] faith
[57:18] are we together praise the lord
[57:21] now
[57:24] but when the prophet comes and says
[57:27] they're both for jewish
[57:29] definitely it gets your attention
[57:35] it catches your attention as and as a
[57:37] preacher it gives you sleepless nights
[57:42] it gives you sleepiest night praise the
[57:45] lord
[57:46] because you have to look at that subject
[57:48] very well
[57:49] you can either be arrogant and stick to
[57:52] your thoughts
[57:53] or you can be humble and come back to
[57:56] the word of god
[57:58] praise the lord so so what i did was
[58:02] i decided to go back and look at the
[58:04] subject
[58:06] and and again what what caught my mind i
[58:09] just think it was the law that was
[58:11] that was helping me because i had a
[58:13] subject on my mind
[58:14] i was listening to uh uh i was listening
[58:18] to something
[58:19] and uh i was listening to
[58:23] to a commentary from uh from
[58:26] from uh a jewish guy
[58:30] uh or he he i mean he said he knows the
[58:33] hebrew
[58:34] so he was talking about isaiah chapter
[58:37] six
[58:38] you know isaiah chapter says what the
[58:40] bible say his strength filled the temple
[58:44] okay that word his strength that word
[58:48] train
[58:49] means it means show it means shown
[58:52] and it also that and the word shown
[58:56] means bother it has the same
[59:00] application with the border on the hem
[59:02] of the garment
[59:04] so when he said that
[59:07] because i was listening to the book of
[59:09] isaiah when he
[59:10] said that it caught my attention i said
[59:14] no i have to look into this i have to
[59:17] look into this there is something
[59:19] about the ham of his garment that i have
[59:22] to look into
[59:23] let's look into matthew chapter
[59:26] 14. let's look into matthew
[59:30] chapter 14
[59:38] oh man praise the lord
[59:47] i know you miss your old church being at
[59:49] home
[59:55] i know you miss the comfort of your old
[59:58] church
[1:00:02] praise the lord and i maybe your pastor
[1:00:05] at the time was nice you have to bear
[1:00:07] with me
[1:00:12] praise the lord what did i say as i i
[1:00:15] mean uh
[1:00:16] matthew chapter 14 praise the lord are
[1:00:20] we together
[1:00:23] matthew chapter 14. amen
[1:00:28] amen amen
[1:00:38] let's read from verse 31
[1:00:42] matthew chapter 14 let's read from verse
[1:00:44] 31
[1:00:45] this was very very very important
[1:00:49] this scripture came very handy and was
[1:00:52] very important to help me
[1:00:53] and immediately jesus stretched for his
[1:00:57] hands and
[1:00:58] cut him that speeded and said unto him o
[1:01:01] thou of little faith wherefore they
[1:01:04] doubt
[1:01:05] doubt and when they were come into the
[1:01:08] ship
[1:01:09] the wayne sees then
[1:01:13] they that were in the ship came and
[1:01:15] worshipped him
[1:01:16] saying of a truth thou are the son of
[1:01:19] god
[1:01:20] and when they were gone over they came
[1:01:24] into the land of jenna syria
[1:01:27] and when the man of that place
[1:01:31] had knowledge of him they sent out
[1:01:36] into all the country around about and
[1:01:39] brought
[1:01:39] unto him all that what disease
[1:01:43] and besought him that they
[1:01:47] that they might only touch
[1:01:50] the ham of his garment so the woman
[1:01:54] other word
[1:01:55] i mean that woman with a blood issue was
[1:01:57] not the only person
[1:02:00] that touched the ham of jesus coming
[1:02:04] now it makes the subject interesting
[1:02:10] now it makes the subject interesting
[1:02:14] praise the lord i love it when it's like
[1:02:16] this because i know i'm all
[1:02:19] into your spirit now i'm all into your
[1:02:21] mind
[1:02:22] [Laughter]
[1:02:23] i love it when i just get you on the
[1:02:26] hook like this
[1:02:27] you know i can just wind you in
[1:02:29] [Laughter]
[1:02:31] praise the lord amen
[1:02:36] and besought him that they might only
[1:02:40] touch the ham of his garment
[1:02:42] and as many as many
[1:02:45] as many as
[1:02:48] many as touch
[1:02:53] we may perfectly hold now in the mouth
[1:02:57] of two or three that's that's word
[1:03:00] that's that's a scriptural principle
[1:03:02] if we can find another scripture to back
[1:03:06] what the scripture says a proof that is
[1:03:09] not a unique event
[1:03:11] that's what i want to bring to you and
[1:03:14] because it was
[1:03:15] not a unique event there was some
[1:03:18] significance
[1:03:20] to the harm of his garment
[1:03:26] are we together because it was not
[1:03:30] a unique event
[1:03:33] so there is a significance
[1:03:37] to the ham of his gaming praise the lord
[1:03:42] so just like i said
[1:03:46] the reason why i'm looking into this and
[1:03:50] and and and going this way is because
[1:03:54] the the prophet by inspiration has has
[1:03:58] driven my my thought to look at it
[1:04:03] barbara was he was not teaching it was
[1:04:05] not teaching that brother branham was
[1:04:07] doing
[1:04:09] he was in the prayer line he was about
[1:04:12] to pray for people
[1:04:13] and we all sat here the first person
[1:04:16] that he called out
[1:04:17] was brother farmer's dad
[1:04:20] but he was preparing the minds of the
[1:04:23] people
[1:04:24] that you don't have to have a prayer a
[1:04:26] prayer card to be prayed for
[1:04:29] just like the woman of the word just
[1:04:32] like jared's daughter
[1:04:33] they both were jews or jewish
[1:04:39] are we together praise the lord
[1:04:43] so that's the reason why sister fed up
[1:04:46] uh entitled dead
[1:04:47] a setting woman i want to make it a part
[1:04:49] two of that message
[1:04:51] so i can be able to anybody listening to
[1:04:55] it and listening to the part two can be
[1:04:56] able to
[1:04:57] understand that uh we progress
[1:05:00] [Laughter]
[1:05:03] whenever the word opened to us we
[1:05:05] progress
[1:05:06] praise the lord don't you love the lord
[1:05:09] for them
[1:05:10] amen we love the lord for death
[1:05:13] as many as touch were made
[1:05:16] perfectly whole now we read
[1:05:22] our scripture reading that we read uh
[1:05:27] this evening was numbers chapter 15.
[1:05:31] let's go back to numbers chapter 15.
[1:05:41] because this is going to be interesting
[1:05:44] praise the lord
[1:05:46] amen i have welcomed you on the flight
[1:05:48] please take your seatbelt
[1:05:53] praise the lord i'm believing that the
[1:05:56] the flight to now will not be bumpy
[1:05:59] amen
[1:06:03] so back in numbers chapter 15 verse 38
[1:06:07] speak to the children of israel tell
[1:06:09] them to make
[1:06:11] a torso on the corner of their garment
[1:06:14] throughout their generation it was
[1:06:18] something that they were supposed to
[1:06:20] wear throughout
[1:06:22] their generation
[1:06:25] amen and
[1:06:29] and and another thing we can put we can
[1:06:31] we can attach to this
[1:06:33] is that uh uh
[1:06:36] what am i reading speak to the children
[1:06:38] of israel
[1:06:39] so we realize here that this
[1:06:43] was not just for the priesthood
[1:06:46] this was for all of the children of
[1:06:49] israel male and female
[1:06:53] it was it was for them it was supposed
[1:06:55] to be
[1:06:56] something that they should put on
[1:07:01] their garmin are we together
[1:07:05] praise the lord let's continue to look
[1:07:07] at that
[1:07:08] closely all the children of israel and
[1:07:11] they must wear it
[1:07:13] all through their generations
[1:07:17] this was not just only an exit address
[1:07:20] this was something that every clothes
[1:07:23] that they buy
[1:07:24] they have to get a blue ribbon and and
[1:07:27] make
[1:07:28] make a border they have to make a border
[1:07:32] we'll call it like a hem you know like
[1:07:34] the way you hand
[1:07:35] hem the the clothes like this you know
[1:07:38] just like here the thread in the end
[1:07:40] at the at the end they have to make a
[1:07:42] border
[1:07:43] of of of their clothes
[1:07:46] so uh uh
[1:07:49] let's continue to read
[1:07:56] they also have to put a blue ribbon
[1:08:18] they have to put a blue ribbon
[1:08:26] to make a french at the border of their
[1:08:29] garment throughout their generation
[1:08:31] and that they pulled the french
[1:08:34] of the border a ribbon of blue
[1:08:39] you know uh blue you know is
[1:08:42] is uh is uh
[1:08:46] it's it's they call it like a heavenly
[1:08:49] color
[1:08:50] you know like the clouds you know the
[1:08:52] heaven the color
[1:08:54] in any way but let's go i will not dwell
[1:08:56] on the color
[1:08:58] and it shall be unto you
[1:09:01] for a french that ye may look upon it
[1:09:05] and remember so they were to they were
[1:09:09] to
[1:09:10] face their clothes like that so when
[1:09:12] they are traveling
[1:09:13] they can look down when they look down
[1:09:17] and the eyes get on the blue their minds
[1:09:21] remember
[1:09:26] so god giving them a way to remind them
[1:09:32] when they look down on that
[1:09:36] then they remember the commandments of
[1:09:38] god
[1:09:42] are we together we see over there in
[1:09:46] detroit
[1:09:46] the bible says they must write it upon
[1:09:48] the their doorposts
[1:09:50] put it upon their bed and you know so so
[1:09:53] the word of god can be
[1:09:55] part of them
[1:09:59] so when you go to work and they are in
[1:10:01] the field
[1:10:02] and they are applauding and whatever
[1:10:04] they are doing when they look down to
[1:10:06] the border
[1:10:06] of of of their garment they can remember
[1:10:10] the commandments of the lord
[1:10:12] so even if a man is in the field and
[1:10:15] he's working and maybe they try to argue
[1:10:17] of
[1:10:18] us and his eyes get on the border of the
[1:10:20] garment he remember the commandments of
[1:10:22] the lord that he has to love his brother
[1:10:30] praise the lord now you have to we have
[1:10:33] to remind ourselves to know
[1:10:37] they did not have the indwelling of the
[1:10:39] holy ghost
[1:10:40] they had the holy ghost but they never
[1:10:42] had the indwelling
[1:10:44] of the holy ghost
[1:10:48] and that's one of the things that jesus
[1:10:50] said the comforter will do
[1:10:52] it will do what it will remind you of
[1:10:54] those things that i have said
[1:10:59] and because they never had the
[1:11:00] indwelling of the spirit
[1:11:02] now god is has designed a way
[1:11:07] for them to remind himself praise the
[1:11:12] lord
[1:11:12] and even we that have the indwelling of
[1:11:15] the holy ghost
[1:11:16] how much we need to design ways to
[1:11:18] remind ourselves
[1:11:19] to be able to meditate upon the word of
[1:11:21] god remind ourselves to pray remind
[1:11:24] ourselves
[1:11:25] of the things that we are taught
[1:11:35] praise the lord because if you don't
[1:11:38] remind yourself it slips away
[1:11:41] amen that's why we take notes down
[1:11:46] in church to remind ourselves
[1:11:50] because you have to realize that your
[1:11:52] mind is a battleground
[1:11:54] don't ever tell yourself say oh i'm
[1:11:56] listening whatever they are saying i'm
[1:11:58] keeping it in my mind
[1:12:00] you are just lying your mind is a
[1:12:03] battleground even when you sit in church
[1:12:05] the devil is blasting your mind with
[1:12:07] things the preacher is saying one thing
[1:12:09] and you're paying attention before you
[1:12:10] realize your mind is caught up your mind
[1:12:12] is flying all over the place
[1:12:15] so if the word means something to you
[1:12:18] find a way to remind yourself
[1:12:24] so when you go away from church you can
[1:12:27] be able to return back to that landmark
[1:12:32] they say yeah this thing was said okay
[1:12:36] yeah praise the lord
[1:12:42] are we together young people
[1:12:48] and all we have cell phones we have
[1:12:51] alpha we have
[1:12:52] the the quotes and scripture all posted
[1:12:55] on
[1:12:55] on the wall so i mean we just we just
[1:12:58] come to church
[1:12:59] flying hands
[1:13:02] but you have to know that that is
[1:13:04] technology
[1:13:07] if there is no light we still going to
[1:13:09] preach
[1:13:12] we just the deacons just have to run
[1:13:14] down to walmart and buy or candle
[1:13:17] we're not going to say oh there is no
[1:13:19] light to the current gun tonight since
[1:13:21] let's just go home and sleep no
[1:13:24] praise the lord you remember the other
[1:13:27] night we were having a prayer meeting
[1:13:28] right
[1:13:29] in there in the cycle the light went off
[1:13:32] there was a ton of storm that came
[1:13:33] we still had our prayer meeting
[1:13:47] so that was the purpose for them to
[1:13:50] remind themselves
[1:13:51] to remember all the commandments of the
[1:13:54] lord
[1:13:54] and do them and that yes
[1:13:58] seek not after your own
[1:14:01] heart the heart is desperately wicked
[1:14:07] our society today said believe your
[1:14:09] heart
[1:14:12] follow your mind
[1:14:16] but god is commanding them do that so
[1:14:19] when you see
[1:14:20] it you can look for a scripture to
[1:14:22] remember
[1:14:27] because that's that is that is uh that
[1:14:29] is the suicide that thing keeps coming
[1:14:31] back to my mind because it keeps coming
[1:14:33] back
[1:14:33] you you tell yourself that that is the
[1:14:36] thing i should do because it keeps
[1:14:37] coming to my mind
[1:14:41] and you never ask yourself whether it's
[1:14:43] it's according to the word of god
[1:14:47] it just keeps coming to my mind so i
[1:14:49] just feel like i should do it
[1:14:51] because if it was wrong it would stop
[1:14:53] coming back to my you don't have control
[1:14:54] over your mind
[1:14:56] brother branham says you don't have no
[1:14:58] thought coming
[1:14:59] you don't have no thought coming
[1:15:04] it sounds as simple
[1:15:07] but it's true and it's powerful and
[1:15:10] everything they have to do with your
[1:15:13] life even your decision
[1:15:15] for work your decision for going home
[1:15:18] and going to bed tonight
[1:15:20] you don't have no thought coming
[1:15:24] if you are thinking to do right there is
[1:15:27] a source of
[1:15:28] inspiration that that thought is coming
[1:15:30] from
[1:15:32] god is responsible for that channel of
[1:15:35] good thoughts that are coming to your
[1:15:36] mind
[1:15:37] as much as the devil is responsible for
[1:15:40] the
[1:15:40] channel of evil thoughts that are coming
[1:15:43] to your mind
[1:15:45] your mind is just a battleground
[1:15:49] it's no man's land but god has given you
[1:15:53] a shotgun of faith
[1:15:55] and you can use that shotgun of faith
[1:15:57] and blow
[1:15:58] all the scarecrow away from your mind
[1:16:00] blow all the devil evil thoughts from
[1:16:02] your mind
[1:16:08] he says look at the blue ribbon so you
[1:16:11] remember the promise of god that you
[1:16:12] will not follow
[1:16:14] your heart
[1:16:17] you will not follow your own your own
[1:16:20] thought but your mind will constantly go
[1:16:22] back to the promises of god
[1:16:24] your mind will constantly go back and
[1:16:27] that's what i encourage the young people
[1:16:29] memorize scripture memorize
[1:16:32] scripture
[1:16:35] memorizing scripture helps to keep
[1:16:38] your mind positive because if
[1:16:42] if if you just if you are you just catch
[1:16:45] yourself
[1:16:46] in the place and says oh where my memory
[1:16:48] verse today
[1:16:50] as use as you try to go back in your
[1:16:53] mind
[1:16:54] to grab that memory verse the holy ghost
[1:16:57] comes down
[1:16:58] and start kicking all those evil
[1:17:00] thoughts out of your mind
[1:17:02] because your channel wants to get the
[1:17:04] word of god
[1:17:11] memory verses has healed people that
[1:17:14] have memory loss
[1:17:22] people that have memory loss that quick
[1:17:24] to forget
[1:17:26] let me say this way quick to forget
[1:17:33] where's my purse where's my key where is
[1:17:36] my spoon
[1:17:39] where's my cup i'm drinking from

[1:17:44] hands and looking for it
[1:17:47] is anyone in the house yeah my hand says
[1:17:51] my hands off i'm the one
[1:18:02] are we together
[1:18:06] you see how how god works he brings out
[1:18:09] one thing
[1:18:10] and he opens the door for many things
[1:18:13] he caught my attention on that it just
[1:18:16] opened the floor gates for many things i
[1:18:17] mean there are a lot of things that i
[1:18:19] went
[1:18:19] into reading and studying i was just so
[1:18:24] blessed let's finish our scripture
[1:18:27] tonight
[1:18:28] well brother steve you have not got the
[1:18:30] clock on tonight so
[1:18:32] we're preaching until we are done
[1:18:36] praise the lord
[1:18:44] that you seek now after your own heart
[1:18:50] and your eye and your own eyes
[1:18:54] after which you use to go
[1:18:58] warring you means it's after you look
[1:19:00] around you know
[1:19:01] all the things that you see the us you
[1:19:04] know
[1:19:04] comes together to settle down in your
[1:19:06] mind you know
[1:19:08] and the devil used those things you know
[1:19:10] to to
[1:19:11] you know try to put our mind on things
[1:19:13] you know that we hear
[1:19:14] and things that we see and all of that
[1:19:16] so you can you can just
[1:19:18] you can just trust your heart you know
[1:19:24] use the word to remind yourself
[1:19:28] praise the lord amen
[1:19:32] is talking to one of mine
[1:19:36] my gals in and i was you know uh
[1:19:40] just conversing and
[1:19:43] talking as a slog i mean they are just
[1:19:47] this this bible it just falls
[1:19:50] it's filled with with with i mean
[1:19:54] pretty praises when people
[1:19:57] just get caught to the place where the
[1:20:00] the
[1:20:00] the thing that what people say about
[1:20:02] them is what matters know
[1:20:05] what god says about you
[1:20:11] praise the lord that's what matters
[1:20:18] he's the one that said you are fearfully
[1:20:20] and wonderfully made
[1:20:23] i'll never leave you i will never
[1:20:25] forsake you
[1:20:27] what what a comfort
[1:20:30] people we people don't find comfort in
[1:20:34] god's word because
[1:20:35] they don't spend time in god's word
[1:20:39] if you spend time in his word and his
[1:20:44] promises
[1:20:53] another benefit of reading the word
[1:20:55] meditating upon the word
[1:20:58] is those those words that you have read
[1:21:02] and you meditating upon it it comes back
[1:21:04] to you
[1:21:05] as voices
[1:21:10] that is the reason why god commanded his
[1:21:13] children
[1:21:14] you know if if a man has a vision or has
[1:21:17] a dream
[1:21:17] or said the lord has spoken unto them
[1:21:20] what
[1:21:20] he asked him to do bring it back to the
[1:21:22] word
[1:21:27] because god only speaks his words to you
[1:21:31] his promises to you
[1:21:35] that ye may remember and do all the
[1:21:37] commandments
[1:21:39] and be holy unto your god so
[1:21:42] that was the importance of that blue
[1:21:45] ribbon that they put on the ham
[1:21:48] of their garden praise the lord
[1:21:52] and they were to wear it throughout all
[1:21:54] their generation
[1:21:55] and i wish i would prove it to you
[1:21:57] because jesus came and he rebuked
[1:22:00] jesus rebuked the pharisees matthew
[1:22:02] chapter 10
[1:22:04] 23 let's look at that 23 uh matthew 23
[1:22:08] verse 5 i became beginning to stumble
[1:22:16] matthew 23 verse 5 i'm i'm almost
[1:22:20] left with seven minutes here so i have
[1:22:22] to speed
[1:22:30] yeah machu 33 but all their works
[1:22:35] they do fall to be seen of men this is
[1:22:39] jesus
[1:22:40] rebuking the pharisees
[1:22:45] why you know why because the pharisees
[1:22:47] have they took
[1:22:48] that that simple commandment that god
[1:22:52] gave them they were now making a faction
[1:22:55] they made their borders big they had
[1:22:58] all sorts of different design in it
[1:23:02] amen something that's supposed to be
[1:23:04] just simple simple blue strap to remind
[1:23:07] yourself
[1:23:08] they're not making a faction i mean they
[1:23:10] had to go to embroidery
[1:23:12] and you know and and design it and and
[1:23:15] this man have to show
[1:23:16] how much he paid do you know how much i
[1:23:18] pay for mine
[1:23:26] so it was something the wall all through
[1:23:28] their generation but here
[1:23:30] is the religious people now and and as
[1:23:33] generation goes by they're weakened on
[1:23:36] the word of god
[1:23:37] they turn the word of god into faction
[1:23:40] so jesus rebuking that generation
[1:23:44] you are gone away from the principle
[1:23:50] it's supposed to be at the ham of your
[1:23:52] garment they will come
[1:23:53] they put blue stripes down your
[1:23:54] undergarment they put another one yet
[1:23:56] again
[1:23:57] they put another one yet again just show
[1:24:00] men's shape
[1:24:05] the darker red themselves with blue uh a
[1:24:08] border all on the addresses and they are
[1:24:10] not even thinking on the word of god
[1:24:12] they are not even meditating on the word
[1:24:14] of god
[1:24:17] praise the lord the word corrects the
[1:24:20] error
[1:24:23] and he was the word for that day
[1:24:28] so he could pick it up immediately and
[1:24:30] correct the error
[1:24:34] are we together
[1:24:41] praise the lord are we together
[1:24:45] and my brother branham talks yeah i
[1:24:47] believe that this he used
[1:24:49] he used another uh uh talking here about
[1:24:53] aaron
[1:24:54] aaron uh a garmin that he used to go in
[1:24:57] the holiest
[1:24:58] of holy now this this
[1:25:01] really does not fully apply to what we
[1:25:04] are saying but
[1:25:05] it kind of forced my mind a little bit
[1:25:08] believe that this era when he
[1:25:12] uh went into the holy so holy once a
[1:25:14] year
[1:25:15] he had to wear a certain kind of
[1:25:17] government he
[1:25:18] and and he and he had to be anointed he
[1:25:21] had
[1:25:21] to take blood with him is that right and
[1:25:24] on the ham of his
[1:25:26] garden he had
[1:25:29] pomegranate and a bell now
[1:25:33] even the priest himself
[1:25:36] he had that he had that uh
[1:25:40] uh pomegranate embelled but he also had
[1:25:45] a blue ribbon so as he's going into the
[1:25:49] holiest of holy
[1:25:50] he's taking step he's looking down
[1:25:54] remembering the promise of god
[1:25:59] because he knows if he goes into that
[1:26:02] present
[1:26:05] with any kind of a corrupt mind or
[1:26:08] corrupt ill feeling he's going to die
[1:26:11] so as he goes the belt is ringing
[1:26:15] he keep his eyes dead and and and
[1:26:18] he read a promise and he takes another
[1:26:21] step he
[1:26:22] keeps his eyes there he read a promise
[1:26:24] just like that
[1:26:29] because he has to keep his mind on the
[1:26:34] lord
[1:26:41] are we together praise the lord
[1:26:48] praise the lord
[1:26:51] now the ham of his garment or the ham of
[1:26:54] the garment
[1:26:56] because we have gone beyond jesus's
[1:26:59] garment now we're talking about aaron's
[1:27:01] garment here going into the holiest of
[1:27:03] holy he has to keep his
[1:27:05] eyes on it that because
[1:27:08] the word of god was attached to the
[1:27:11] heart
[1:27:11] of their garment it had very very very
[1:27:15] important
[1:27:16] significance remember
[1:27:21] because of time first samuel
[1:27:25] chapter 15 what happened in first samuel
[1:27:28] chapter 15
[1:27:29] was when samir
[1:27:34] told saul samuel last word to saul
[1:27:41] there because he have disobeyed god god
[1:27:43] has rejected him
[1:27:45] what they saw they he reached out
[1:27:50] the bible says for the ham
[1:27:53] of samuel garmin
[1:27:57] and when he reached out and told it what
[1:27:59] the samuel said to him
[1:28:02] that just how the lord has done your
[1:28:04] kingdom
[1:28:13] praise the lord
[1:28:17] first time you're chapter 24
[1:28:25] first samuel chapter 24 will bring us to
[1:28:27] the place of david
[1:28:29] running away from saul
[1:28:35] and just like we we talk about it
[1:28:41] when we when we spoke on the beauty and
[1:28:42] the beast if you can remember
[1:28:46] david had an opportunity
[1:28:52] and the bible says the lord put a deep
[1:28:55] sleep
[1:28:57] on saul and david
[1:29:00] stepped in there and he took the ham of
[1:29:03] salt garment
[1:29:05] and he cut it
[1:29:11] praise the lord
[1:29:15] that was also important when david
[1:29:19] did that praise the lord
[1:29:23] when david did that
[1:29:30] amen let me just let me just try to find
[1:29:34] a place here
[1:29:43] because it was very important you
[1:29:45] remember in that in that story
[1:29:48] david repented to saw
[1:29:52] because because they knew what the
[1:29:55] importance is
[1:29:58] i was as i was studying even uh
[1:30:01] it was it was a sign of separation it
[1:30:04] was a sign of divorce
[1:30:06] if a man was angry with his wife in
[1:30:08] those days he could take
[1:30:10] the ham of her garment and just cut it
[1:30:12] she knew exactly what was happening
[1:30:14] when he did that
[1:30:17] so that that that is the kind of a
[1:30:19] weight he had
[1:30:20] and the reason is because god attached
[1:30:24] his word to the harm of their garment
[1:30:29] he says put that blue ribbon there
[1:30:33] to be able to remember my word
[1:30:36] so the entire world the entire promise
[1:30:40] of god
[1:30:40] was was was uh was right there
[1:30:44] for them to be able to remember
[1:30:54] i mean there have to be something for
[1:30:56] them to remember
[1:30:58] so i believe they read the the torah or
[1:31:01] they went to
[1:31:02] to the temple and whatever the preacher
[1:31:04] read
[1:31:05] from the torah when it goes into the
[1:31:08] field and goes into their work
[1:31:10] when they look at the arabian they tried
[1:31:12] to remember the service
[1:31:13] they tried to remember what they read
[1:31:15] they tried to remember even the little
[1:31:17] ones
[1:31:18] tried to remember the the the scripture
[1:31:21] that mama read to them
[1:31:24] it was something
[1:31:28] that god commanded them to do in all
[1:31:31] their generation
[1:31:32] now see another beautiful part here that
[1:31:35] that caught my attention also
[1:31:38] was malacca chapter four
[1:31:43] oh man malachi chapter 4
[1:31:47] praise the lord
[1:31:58] malachi chapter four are we together
[1:32:06] i'll read verse two
[1:32:15] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[1:32:18] son of righteousness
[1:32:21] rise with healing in his wings
[1:32:25] now this healing in his wings let me
[1:32:28] read a quote here for you then i will
[1:32:30] get into what i want to say
[1:32:31] uh what is the attraction on the
[1:32:33] mountain i've been looking
[1:32:35] uh used this quote many times
[1:32:40] but when i was setting for what is the
[1:32:43] attraction on your mountain then i saw
[1:32:45] it again
[1:32:46] so let's read this together what is the
[1:32:47] attraction on on the mountain
[1:32:50] do i have that there is a fake okay
[1:32:52] let's read that
[1:32:53] brother branham said he's reading that
[1:32:55] he's reading the very scripture
[1:32:57] that we we just read he says but unto
[1:32:59] you that fear my name
[1:33:01] shall the son of righteousness
[1:33:05] rise with healing campaigns
[1:33:09] healing in healing in his wings
[1:33:13] he said healing campaigns because what
[1:33:16] wings does a fly all over
[1:33:18] so healing campaigns was all over
[1:33:22] praise the lord that's what wings does
[1:33:25] it fly everywhere
[1:33:27] so the son of righteousness rise in our
[1:33:30] bay
[1:33:31] with healing campaigns because there
[1:33:33] were healing
[1:33:34] meetings all over
[1:33:37] seven times
[1:33:43] with healing campaigns healing in his
[1:33:47] wings
[1:33:49] now that word wins
[1:33:52] the word wins means
[1:33:55] bother and the word
[1:33:58] wings also apply to the hem
[1:34:02] of the garment because the hem of their
[1:34:05] garment
[1:34:06] was the border of their skirt it was
[1:34:09] the wings of their garment
[1:34:15] praise the lord now so you see because
[1:34:18] the the the the seraphim in uh uh
[1:34:22] uh isaiah chapter six
[1:34:25] the reason why isaiah the prophet
[1:34:28] disrupted
[1:34:30] as his stream filled the temple because
[1:34:32] their wings
[1:34:34] blended together and it was in a tree
[1:34:37] it was in a train form just like this
[1:34:40] going around
[1:34:42] that's the reason why brother branham
[1:34:44] says in ezekiel
[1:34:46] it was like the wheels in the middle of
[1:34:48] the wheels
[1:34:50] he says a revelation chapter 4
[1:34:54] series he says the same angel
[1:34:57] those cherubim from eden he says
[1:35:01] it spoke from the beginning
[1:35:04] the redemption of the church he said
[1:35:06] that was the church
[1:35:07] traveling that was the protection of the
[1:35:09] church throughout the ages
[1:35:11] there in there it was in eden at the
[1:35:14] beginning of the church
[1:35:15] he says in revelation those same angels
[1:35:18] were found before the throne of god
[1:35:22] so in god's mind the church has already
[1:35:26] arrived home
[1:35:32] are we together so
[1:35:35] those wings of the angels are the mother
[1:35:45] healing in his wings
[1:35:50] if they have the same significance then
[1:35:52] you can see why these people
[1:35:54] wanted to touch the ham of his garment
[1:35:57] because they believed
[1:35:58] they were healing in the wings of his
[1:36:00] curse
[1:36:07] we just love the lord
[1:36:10] amen
[1:36:17] musicians you can come for tonight
[1:36:21] it's just afraid if we can try that song
[1:36:23] if i could touch
[1:36:24] the ham of his garmin
