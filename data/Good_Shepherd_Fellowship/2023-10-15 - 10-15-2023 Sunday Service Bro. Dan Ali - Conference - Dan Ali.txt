from one service to another service even though it's a short time it's a long time for the enemy to do anything he wants to do and it's also a long time for God to honor himself yesterday um A call came from Brother one it was very very early in the morning um 12 something so I woke up in the morning and I said no this call 12 something it must be something urgent so I I called him and uh he told me brother uh Max brother Max was not doing fine and uh he he needed us to pray for him so right away I called uh brother Marx and I didn't get him but he called back and um when I was talking to him um I wouldn't I wouldn't tell his story for him but from the little I gathered and from what happened it was an attack the brother was not sick when he went to bed and all of a sudden in the state in which he found himself so much so that he even got a hold of his phone he was able to D dial 911 and yet could not even speak I mean I I have heard two stories of this nature that never ended well and for him to be here with his family this morning is nothing but the glory of [Applause] God the enemy would never P stop perceiving you as a child of God but one thing is sure that the Lord Our God always has his eyes on you it doesn't matter whether you're on top of the hill you're in the valley whether you're on the sick bed it doesn't change anything always remember that the Lord Our God has his eyes on you and I just want to give God the glory praise be to God thank you Lord yes we are serving a great and a wonderful God wonderful praise be to God yes so what do we have this morning one morning I just woke up just between the master bedroom and the doorway to the master the the the toilet the white conference just came to me and it was it was it was so so hard normally when those things come to me then I just go to work I sit down I go to my computer just you know and a few things come I just put them down but on this occasion I just remember that no I have heard a few quotes and a sermon on conference and I believe the prophet of God has preached this so let me go search it and I went and searched and there were seven messages conference amen and I said I was going to listen to all of them I listened to the first five and on Friday the plan was to listen to the sixth one and I started listening to it then about halfway I realized that it was not even the message conference I was listening to something said turn it off and go back to conference and I said no let go of it and then I realized why I went there I didn't even know I was there though and that was the message confirmation and evidence amen and there was something that I picked there even though I didn't intend to go there which is very important to what we are going to do this morning praise be to God am so by the grace of God we are going to look at the message conference it so much blessed me so so much blessed me that I just want us to encourage ourselves this morning praise be to God there is nothing that can ever be compared to being a child of God there is nothing that can ever be compared to being a Christian amen not just going to church on Sunday or Wednesdays but seeing the word of God becoming flesh in you am amen experiencing the nature of God in this life the power and the authority of God in your life beginning to taste of heavenly things even on this Earth there is nothing that compares to it praise be to God and we are in a conference here this morning if we can please turn and turn our Bibles to um Isaiah 11:16 Isaiah 11 16 I would probably start from 15 and I read and when ye spread forth your hands I will hide my eyes from ye when you make many prayers I will not hear your hands are full of blood wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil Lear to do well seek judgment relief the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the Widow come now and let us Rasen together seeth the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word in Jesus name amen shall we be seated praise be to God come now not later not when you feel convenient come now and let us Rasen together sayth the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as W praise be to God with we are looking at the message conference now what is a conference I looked it up a conference is a formal meeting for discussion so then I had to go look out what the word formal is the word formal means that it is done the meeting is done in accordance with rules of convention that is suitable for any situation or occasion so the meeting is not held just in a balance but there are a set of rules and regulations there are laws pertaining to this meeting that whatever discussion that we are going to have we are going to have that discussion in relation to a set of rules or regulations or lws then and while I was thinking about it the a school conference just came in the view for those of you that have gone school I mean gone to school in this country our parents here who have children going to school once in a while you are called to the school for a conference and then you go in as a parent why because the school has a set of rules rules that they expect every student in the school to abide by so when you have a child in the school that is not obeying the rules is misbehaving in school then they call you for a conference and then you come in and they tell you these are our regulations this is the expectation we have of every student in this school how be it this is what your son or your daughter is doing which is alien to what we stand for so the meeting is just not a meeting in the air but the school has an expectation for every student in the school and because they had they are not behaven according to those set of rules or the regulations and com conf is called and then you come and then they discuss it and there are expectations thereafter sometimes a child may not be misbehaving but they may not be doing well in school again the school has an expectation for every student so what is going on could there be something in the house could there be something in school could there be something bothering them they call a conference your child is not doing well in this area not doing well in this area his grace are not meeting our expectation we are wondering whether there is something wrong a conference is called to discuss the matter and to find a way out whenever those conferences are called it's not just for the sake of it it's to discuss the problem and then find a way out not to discuss it and leave it where it is but to discuss it and find a solution to it praise the Lord amen and here the prophet of God talks about you know a lot of conferences after the world war the big four he talks about the UN conference the Geneva conference the Paris conference and um a lot of conferences he talks about now in these conferences they are just politicians subject matter intellectuals that come together from all the countries into that conference just to make rules for the rest they don't ask your participation they don't ask your opinion it doesn't matter whether you agree with it or not but they go in they represent you anyhow it doesn't matter whether you like them or not and then they come to an agreement that this is what we are going to do and they enforce it on the rest of the people and you would realize that in a lot of these conferences the political will is not there we can talk about the Kyoto conference and the other conference that has to do with the latest that is the ozone layer depletion where the countries meet together and then they talk about cutting down on greenhouse gases because the ozone layer is depleting there is um the the weather is changing um the the the the ice in the in the in the in the colder regions are melting I mean but there is no political will they meet they come to an agreement on what to do and yet they don't follow it with action you can have a conference get to the cracks of the problem and the solution is prescribed because there is no lack of commitment you can walk out and 10 20 30 40 years later you are still the same or you can even get worse yes it is not because there was no conference it was not because the problem was not discussed it was not because the problem was not dealt with but then there was lack of commitment there was lack of commitment you were not committed to it that's true and because of that you didn't take it up and why there is no commitment why that will is not there it doesn't help you now in this messages the prayer of God talks about the Garden of Eden conference and we are going to start right there the garden of aen conference praise the Lord that God created the heavens and the Earth the Earth was so beautiful everything was in order there was no man to till the ground God formed Men Out of the Dust of the earth breathe light into him everything was what God wanted it to be now God brought man into this life everything was perfect there was love not just between Adam and Eve even in the animal kingdom there was so much love there was peace there was Harmony between the lion the bear the antelope the deer there was so much peace that they could sit and fellowship together but that was going to be interrupted why because God had in him an attribute to be a savior and to be a savior something must get lost for you to salvage but if everything is what it is what do you save there is nothing to save so something must get out of order amen and God was going to ensure that something would get out of order that the peace that they were enjoying was going to be interrupted the Lord that was there was going to be interrupted the harmony there was it was going to be interrupted in fact as I was looking at this a thought came to me that it was not an easy thing for God remember we are talking about a just God we are talking about a holy God and to think of what is going to happen in the garden or what was going to happen in the garden I don't think it was easy for God that by that act this Earth we are living in was just going to become one big prison I don't think it was an easy thing for God I remember years ago when I was serving in the Ghana prison service I was at a local prison called TAA TAA prison service and a mother brought her only son he was not just an only son but he was the only child I am not sure where the father was at then I think the father had passed or something to that effect so the mother was the mother and the father at the same time and as we said every every every parent has an expectation for their children and this child was growing and then the child started fellowshipping with people and doing things they ought not to do so the father actually the mother the mother went to court and spoke to the judge that you know what this is what my son is doing I don't want him to grow to be a bad child I want you to put him in behind bars just for 6 months let him go and experience life in prison and when he come comes back he will be a changed person it's unfortunate [Music] though being a prison officer I can tell you for a fact that the people who come to prison with minor crimes when they leave they go and they commit bigger ones because it's like the prison is a school that they come and they learn about all the dirty tricks and they to use them when they get out the mother didn't know but how be it this child I mean a very innocent teenager I mean I used to see him and my heart would break because in the prison he didn't even have any company he was just by himself he just took life as it was but do you know between the mother and her son who was in prison the mother was actually more in prison than his her son the mother was leing 94 miles away and normally prisoners are allowed one visit in a week and that one visit is just of 15 minutes the mother will travel 94 miles to come to the prison and then she'll come and sit with the son it's 15 minutes the mother doesn't want to leave yeah and we are telling her it's time the mother doesn't want to leave finally she was allowed two visit visits in a week instead of one and she will come and she doesn't want to leave she couldn't stand it she went back to the court and they took the boy out before the six months and for God to think that what I am allowing what is going to happen to him humanity is going to create chaos it's going to create mder it's going to create Wars it's going to create earthquake it's going to create tornadoes it's going to create problem between a man and his neighbor father and son mother and daughter there is going to be Chaos on the earth and God still looks on and allows it to happen I don't think it was an easy thing I don't think it was an easy thing just imagine you a father having your only daughter fathers love their daughters so much and a daughter you so much love and then you sit down and then you watch your enemy to come under your roof to come in misbehave you will put a bullet in the head of that man if God doesn't come down and then God sits on his throne and here comes the Devil comes to his only daughter has God said that you should not eat of the Trees of the garden oh no God said we can eat any tree we want but the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil which is in the midst of garden we should not eat it for the very day we eat it we shall surely die oh you will not surely die it will make you wise it will make you Gods it will make I as I was thinking about it again it just hit me that you can put a can by the roadside and people would just walk past it 24 hours a day and nobody would B to open it but the very day you say nobody should open this can here yeah right then human beings get curious why did they say we shouldn't open it no there should be something inside there then the people want to know what is inside human beings are always human beings it's only God who can handle us we are so so so stubborn God have mercy but under these circumstances this fall was ordained to be nothing could stop this fall nothing could stop this fall because there was an attribute in God to be a savior and something must fall amen Adam and Eve had no choice and as a matter of fact brother Bram said everything that was in God's original creation couldn't fall so for the fall to take place God had to bring if out of Adam after he had rested on the seventh day and then here comes the devil gets so dangerously close to God's only daughter and the father is sitting on the throne and looking down and I guess the Angels were just going to him Master have you seen what is happening down in in the garden said how do you know fast forward in several messages brother talks about when the three Hebrew children were being mared into the fairy fness and how the angel Gabriel went to God with his sron he said Master have you looked down in Babylon that your three children that have stood for you are being mared into the fairy furnace should I go down and wipe it out of out of the map God said no calm down you have been a very faithful Angel to me take it easy and here comes wormwood that flooded the all Earth with water and destroyed every single everything single creature that was on the Earth surface Master have you seen what is going on in Babylon let me go and then just waste water there and wipe it out of History the father said no take and I believe I believe that when the enemy when Satan went so close to the daughter of God I believe the Angels were not sitting down I believe they were ready don't forget that a war had just been fought in heaven that's right when Lucifer and his angels fought against Angel Michael and his angels till there was no room left was in heaven and he was cast down on Earth and I believe that when the Angels saw it they knew there was going to be another Showdown yeah they were ready with their sords ready to go to war Master have you seen what is going on the enemy is getting too close and God says take it take it see wased on wased on wased on till the devil beguiled God's only daughter I believe the Angels were confused they asked themselves what just happened how would the holy God sit down and look at this happen what just happened we know God loves his children could God have stopped this yes but what just happened they never understood it praise the Lord they questioning themselves and at the appointed time God went down as you usual to have fellowship with his children that did not stop him and probably the Angels were looking on oh he is going to destroy them he is going to destroy them because they know he is a holy God he is the god of light in whom there is no Darkness not even a trace of Darkness God does not fellowship with sin and as he was going down I believe they were saying in their house oh these people are consumed he's going to destroy them because they know that the first group that attempted it Lucifer and his angels never had a second chance right and those up there who have never fallen do not know what Redemption means but in between the angel that fell who never had a second chance and those that have not Fallen who do not know what sin means or Redemption means there are a people in between amen praise be to God who knows what Redemption means and God comes down and they were thinking God was going to destroy them and God rather performs a sacrifice takes an an innocent animal and offers a sacrifice for his children they were confounded what just happened there is a song a song that says the song is not coming but when We Gather Before the Throne of God and we begin to sing the the Redemption song that the Angels cannot follow that song they can't that's true because they don't know what Redemption means but you and I know what Redemption means amen hallelujah and God comes down to have a conference with his children and in that conference God tells his children you have broken my heart what is it that you guys have done we know the story I'm not going to spend too much time on that but God cured the serpent on your belly th shall go all the days of your life and dust thou shall eat and when it comes to the woman he said you are going to give birth in sorrow in sorrow you are going to experience birth pain it came to Adam he cursed the land for Adam's sake praise be to God Amen but God established something that an innocent blood was shed and innocent blood was shed because they were supposed to die but an innocent lamb had to die for them to live and that was an established order and now to it was a bing Bush conference that a man by the name Moses who looked at Egypt and then he kissed Egypt goodbye and promised himself never to return back to Egypt just went away and in the wilderness of media he got himself a wife was taking care of his father-in-law and he was happy with life he was happy with life and I believe in the 40 years he was in the wilderness I believe with all my heart that he asked himself a lot of questions because growing up his mother would tell him you are born to deliver the children of Israel from their bondage that you are a promised child you are a good child you are the Redeemer you redeem these people from their bondage and he grew up knowing that he was going to be the deliverer so when he saw that an Egyptian and an Israelite were fighting he just went in and then he killed the Egyptian he thought he did it in secret the next time he would realize that his cover was blown was when his two brothers were having an argument and then he weighed in and one said do you think you can kill me the way you kill the Egyptian he said oh my cover is blown he feared for his life and he ran away so in those 40 years he was in the wilderness I believe he was asking himself a question Oh I thought I was going to be the deliverer so mommy lied to me I wasn't after all if I was how come I am here or maybe I had all the opportunity in the world because I was going to be the next Pharaoh maybe I acted too fast maybe I should have just rested myself and waited till I took over the throne then I can free these people so true you may you may think that the Mind battles you are going through today just started with you it has always been and it would always be the Mind battles we are going through today in the greatest battle ever fought this is the ground praise be to God you would be having thoughts and you would think it's you it's not you you the devil can never get in here until he's able to conquer you up here amen and he was going through this but one day it was meant to be another usual day he goes up with his sheep and in the wilderness where he had been all these years he saw that there was a bush that was burning yet it was not consumed and the Bible says he turned to look at it then he heard Moses Moses say yes here I am said don't move any further the ground on which you are standing is a Holy Ground take the shoes off your feet praise be to God the Bible says be ye holy because the Lord our God is Holy it is not dos and don'ts it is not do and don'ts that you sit down and then you you can plan what to do and what not to do so you can be holy no it has nothing to do with you your good works at best is as filthy rat in the sight of God it has nothing to do with your good works be you holy because the Lord your God is Holy is when God can you imagine on that piece of land where God was telling Moses to take off his shoes because it was a Holy Ground can you imagine how many times in his life in those 40 years can you imagine how many times he passed there amen and the shoes jumping there and head butting one another but on this day it was a Holy Ground why because the glory of God had come down amen it's when God comes into you yeah amen it doesn't matter what life you have lived amen it doesn't matter how useless that life is it doesn't matter how wretched you think it is when God comes into that life that becomes a holy life know ye not that you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost God does not dwell in tents made of human hands ye are the Temple of the Holy Ghost when God comes into you you are a holy vessel amen You Are Holy praise be to God [Music] am and then the discussion starts Moses I have seen the afflictions of my people I have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters and I am come down to deliver them but Moses I am sending you to Egypt father what did you say you sending me to Egypt oh no you can send me anywhere I'll be willing to go anywhere not in Egypt the father said I'm sending you to Egypt I am a wanted man in Egypt as a matter of fact I kill somebody and they need me they want to kill me that was why I ran for my dear life the father said I'm send you back to Egypt so oh um I'm not even a good person I'm a Stam I can't speak the father said who makes a man to speak Hallelujah who makes a man dump amen no um you know sometimes we try to hide behind our disabilities in order to get away from from the service of the lord we try to find excuses why we should not be in the T of God why we should not be in the service of the Lord he was hiding behind his excuses how he was a wanted man how he could not speak oh you could send somebody uh no even even the people were asking me to go and deliver they themselves they don't like me two of them were fighting I wanted to come in and one said no you didn't you can kill me like you kill the Egyptian God said Moses I am sending you to Egypt praise the Lord he gave all the excuses but those excuses were not enough God said you would go is your brother not Aaron he's going to be a prophet unto you and God sent him with two signs he said what do you have in your hand he said a stick throw it down he threw it down and it turned into a snake and he jumped and started running away and God said Moses come back and take it by the tail I don't know that thing I fear it I don't know about you I don't even want to see his picture and God said come back and take it by the tail I don't know whether that thing was just lying down straight or it was just turn around like we know it to do and they knows you coming after it I will just plead with God let this one go I have another stick in the house praise the Lord God take it for the tail I don't know how long it took but he finally got it praise the Lord God said put your hand in your bosom he took it out it was very lepos he didn't even want to see it said put it back put it back took it out it was clean that I stand you with these two signs go that when it will come to pass if they don't believe the first sign they believe the second look if God has not called you there is nothing you can do right but if God has called you for the task yes how fast can you run away how far can you go how far can you go we saw in the life of Jonah when God sent him to nineve he wanted to run away instead of him enjoying that cruise to Neve he finally went there in the belly of a whale praise the Lord how far can you go to get away the book of Psalms say that whe shall I go to get away from thy Spirit or whe shall I go to get away from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven behold Thou Art there yes if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I should take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost part of the sea even day thy hand shall guide me and thy right hand hand shall Lead Me amen where a child of God a child of God how fast can you run away from God how far can you go you only give yourself a lot of headaches you only give yourself a lot of heartaches you only give yourself a lot of problems you can never be like another person yes you will always be you am and there is not another you and whatever purpose God has brought you into into this life to do or to accomplish you would accomplish it to the letter God is not looking at you in whatever state you see yourself he has a better picture of you which you have no idea of with every trial with every Temptation with every disappointment with every failure you are taking a step towards that perfect picture amen and Moses went and we know the story how it ended praise the Lord then the prop talks about the resy conference the rest SE conference um I know time is good we are we're on a very good side but I would like to skip the rescue conference and let us go to the Gethsemane conference and this is the mother of all conferences the mother of all conferences the conference that has made it possible for you and me to be seated here this morning or this afternoon the conference that the fathers of old the Patriarchs looked forward to that we in this day and age are depending on and the generations Yet to Come are depending on they were all dependent on this conference and his outcome that when job went through all the trials and God just opened his eyes just a little on that Easter morning when he saw what he saw he screamed I know my redeemer liveth and in the last day I shall see him with my eyes though the skin worm destroyed his flesh yet in my flesh shall I see him he saw it a far off and he was looking at this conference the conference that was going to restore us back God to who we truly are the conference that was going to unite Heaven and Earth together and man and his God together the conference that was going to make the impossibility possible praise be to God the got many conference that the Lord Jesus when the time had come and here comes the father are you ready for this and say yes Father I am ready for this are you sure you want to do this you want to give your life for these people are you sure you want to do it he said yes remember it's not going to be easy it's going to be a brutal death how they mock at you there is a crown of tone a tone of crown that is awaiting you you are going to die the most gruesome death are you sure you are ready he said yes I am ready I'm ready to give my life for them for this cause I came brother Bram said that he could have chosen not to die he could have chosen it father I'm not ready I came for this purpose but I have changed my mind but that wasn't it he was ready to go to the Cross he was ready to go to the cross for you and me to lay down his life for you and me to be mocked at and made fun of for you and me he never committed any sin but he became sin because he was carring upon his shoulder my sins and your sins carrying them to the cross thank you Lord what a difficult time it was and the father asked him are you ready but you know this time I'm just going to step a step back say no father don't forsake me no I will not forsake you but you know you are going to become sin so much so that I have to take a step back you have to die on the cross but I promise you I will not suffer your body to see corruption you are going to rise up today it was not an is it him because the Bible says he prayed and prayed and prayed till the sweat of his face became like clots of blood and he told the father father if it's possible take away this crap take it away but I believe in that process he was thinking of you he was thinking of you he was thinking of me if they should pass away What Becomes of these people it is hard to Bear then he comes back father nonetheless not my will but let your will be done praise be to God praise be to God I think uh let me read um uh yes one nevertheless not my will but let your will be done praise be to God I'm looking at the time very closely let's see what the Lord will do for us here now in the message Conference 1959 122 uh 1220m the conference was set the lamb young a beautiful life never a life like that never was never will be a life like that the lamb had but now the father said are you willing is your love for your brethren great enough is your love for that sinful sinking world that you were born in do you love them enough to fit your life do you love them enough to take their place to Bear their sins to the hardest crucial death there could be nothing die that kind of death but him and in that conference such a decision was made until blood dropped from his brow he was under the strain the sins of the world was upon him him and when he looked into the face of the dve and said not my will but thy will be done oh can we have that decision in our hearts this morning praise be to God Amen can we have that decision in our hearts this morning can you forfit that little filthy life of yours are you willing to look into the face and say into his face and say not my will I am a drunkard but I will drink no more hallelu I'm a gambler I will drink no more I'm immoral but I'll be that no more I'm a liar but I will stop today thank you I'm a fou person but in this conf this morning I will look into your face and and and take like my master who died for me to make my way clear not my will your will if it cost me my home if it cost me my husband my wife my father my mother my fellowship my church member whatever it cost me in this conference this morning I say I want your Holy Spirit to live in me I've heard about it I want you in me not mine but yours praise the Lord that's my decision God has called the place not upon some high Pinnacle place but a humble little Tabernacle about to fall in we are having a conference praise be to God we are having a conference right now we are having a conference right now of all that he could do he said not my will not my will but let your will be done amen he went down the cross carried his own cross with all the beating with all the mocking with all the wavs he went through all that he went through all that with you in his mind every whip he took was for you everything he went through was for you and me amen it was not an easy conference praise the Lord sometimes we think that when you begin to serve God things automatically should get better but as a matter of fact a lot of the times they get worse praise be to God a lot of the times they get worse don't expect an easy Road for it is not an easy road we are walking on some people gave their lives for this gospel it's a gospel that is dripping with blood as a matter of fact some people were given the option just deny Christ and we will set you free they chose to die believ in God it is not how long you live live that mares metella lived the longest and for every time we call his name it's just one thing we can say about him that he live the longest it is not how long you live that marage it's what you do with your life and as certain as the sun rises from the East and settles from the West I don't know even where my East and West is it is certain that this world has surely come to an end we are living in a b time there is no more time we are living in a borrow time God is just waiting for the last person to come in and that will be the end one thing the Bible says God would not lose one God would not lose one if you are a child of God God will bring you in am if it will cause you to come on broken bottles you are going to come in anyhow thank you Lord but God will not leave you behind can you get to that place with all the rights you have as an American with all the opportunity you have in this country with all the choices you can make can you get to a point and look at all those things and then say not my will but let the will of God be done that I want to identify myself with the Lord despise few and not with anything this world can provide to live a consecrated life a life that preaches the gospel a life that presents Christ before the people a life that gives people hope praise be to God Can you look at yourself just beat the world A Farewell and turn on to Christ and give your all give your all if others have given their lives if others have given their lives for this same gospel not another gospel for this same gospel if others have given their lives for this same gospel how hard how hard is it how hard will it be for you to decide no I'm not going to be a gambler anymore I'm not going to drink anymore I'm not going to fornicate anymore I'm not going to go on YouTube and watch filthy things anymore I'm going to consecrate my life unto God I'm going to live a holy life if people gave their lives and they died for it why would you stand on that day when they come out and then they they are giving their testimony what they want through what would be your testimony praise the Lord amen got many conference got conference praise the Lord then the prophet talks about the P the Pentecostal conference that after the death the barrier and the is resurrection of Christ there was another conference praise be to God amen amen praise be to God in the same message 9591 1220m conference with God now let me speak of one more conference here just a moment many could be thought of uh yes there was a conference after his death burial and Resurrection something had to be done there were men that had intellectual conception so there was another great conference set we know it they had to have a conference and something had to be done for Jesus said Don't Preach no more don't sing no more don't sing anymore don't go out and Minister anymore but I want a conference with you you and in this conference I'm going to bring the Holy Spirit but go up to the city of Jerusalem and there you wait until I get back I've got to go up to heaven and let them rejoice and I've got to go up to the throne of majesty the body of Jesus but I am going we are going to have a conference up up there and the god that dwells in me has promised that I could return back again and I will be with you I'll will be in you with you in you even to the end of the consumation the world until it's all over I will be with you amen and the works that I do will you do also so they didn't know how they ever do this so they went to Pentecost and 120 went into the upper room and closed the door and they waited and they waited the trouble with us if we don't get audience with God in about 10 minutes we are tired our knees are hurting we want to live if he hasn't answer us again according to what we want the way we think we are disgusted with him oh come let us reason together go up to Pentecost I want to reason I want to reason it with you just go up there and wait 10 days there had been sitting standing praying everything waiting for the promise and all of a sudden the result of the conference in heaven came down the Holy Ghost like a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting they were filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and they went forward preaching the word when they had when we have World conferences we usually have their selected place and what they do at these conferences they drink drinks cocktails they smoke cigars and cigarettes they lie to one another and deceive one another and peace talk of the world but when God calls a conference is fasting cleaning up prayer receiving orders and going forward that's God's conference not feasting but fasting not indulging in filth but separating cleansing yourself from all unrighteousness when you go before God cleaning yourself by faith through applying the hisop to the blood and cleansing your heart and walking before God for a conference that's the kind of conferences when you meet with God then God gives you orders then go you for and then you go forward praise be to God Amen the Pentecostal conference getting the Holy Ghost is not an option it's not I will think about it it's not when I feel like like it it's not I want to or I don't want to God sent down the Holy Ghost for you and me the Holy Ghost is looking for a dwelling place and the Holy Ghost dwells in our hearts the Bible says by one Spirit are we baptized into one body except you have the Holy Ghost you would surely perish you have to make sure that the Holy Ghost has taken a hold of your life that when you are going to bed you can go knowing not thinking or not with a Feeling but you can go to bed knowing that if Christ comes in the middle of the night I'll be gone it's times to be certain this is not a time of uncertainty with all the confusion that is going on in the world today between Russia uh Ukraine America France are in Israel hisbah Hamas I mean there is so much confusion in the world today if the devil can use that to distract your attention he will but do not let anything come between you and your God don't let anything come between you and your God not your brother not your sister not your father not your mother not your neighbor do not let anything come between you and God that when it comes to your service to God let it be you and your God alone if there is a brother or a sister that is of an encouragement to you praise God if your eye would cause it your F plug it out and if your right hand will cause you to sin cut it off if there is somebody around your life that is not helping your spiritual life forget of them praise be to God conference conference praise the lord and there is another conference that is the Judgment conference praise the Lord amen now of all these conferences I have had to skip some just for the sake of time of all these conferences you realize that you can have a choice now when we go back to the beginning there is no man that had a choice to come into this world other than the way God has ordained it of course we KN we know according to scripture it was not supposed to be the way it is today but because of the Fall God permitted it praise the Lord Lord and the Bible says every man is born a sinner every man every woman in sin did my mother conceive me and in iniquity was I shiing so before you came into this life you were already a sinner you had no choice about it that is why the prophet of God says that God would not condemn a man man for being a sinner but when you choose to remain a sinner right then God is going to condemn you because there is a provision now that has been made a provision has been made you didn't have a choice then but now you have a choice that you can choose to be free or you can choose to remain in your sins praise be to God and there is a judgment conference that is coming and in this conference all will be there as the song says there is a song all will be there in this judgment each one receiving praise the Lord I can just see the song hovering around here praise the Lord amen yes now remember remember that you as a child of God you are going through your judgment right now the bride of Christ would never go through that white Throne judgment because we are going through our judgment right now when Christ take his judgment seats his bride is going to be by his side amen and we are going to judge the world together but before that Throne of judgment would be all Sinners and the remnant of the church that didn't go in the Rapture that is another topic on his own praise the Lord in this judgment you have no choice you have no choice you would be there anyhow you will be there anyhow you have no choice to make this brings me back to the story I was sharing last week about the prophet talking about um John John Daniel Curry praise the Lord that this was a man that lived a Godly life a man that demonstrated the power of God a man that one soul to Christ he was a great evangelist and then he had a dream or a TR you would call it that he had died he got Before the Throne of God and the gatekeeper told him we can't find your name here oh there must be a mistake somewhere I am that great evangelist I want a lot of souls for Christ my name should be there he checked he said sir your name is not I can't find your name do you want to appeal your case before the great white Throne judgment he said yes I want to appeal my case and then in the story he was just going up and going up it was light it was light it was light he kept going and going and going till he got to that place it was just light thousand times stronger than the sun the light of the Sun the then he heard Daniel Curry did you ever tell a lie he thought he never did but in that light you would come clean yes I did Daniel Curry were you Faithful he Once Upon a Time thought he did no I was not faithful then carry and then he realized that no it was not what he thought it was and now he was just waiting for the final instruction you hypocrite come on go into hell and burn forever and then he just heard he just heard the sweetest voice the sweetest voice there could ever be praise be to God father he stood for me whil he was on Earth I stand for him praise be to God and the Bible says if the righteous scarly is scarely saved where would the Sinner and ungodly appear if the righteous is scarcely saved where with the sinners and the ungodly appear we are having a conference right now it's 103 I will not keep you here longer than um I promise I'll be ending very soon praise be to God when the righteous are scarcely saved where would the Sinners and ungodly appear but be before that Dreadful Day praise be to God God has sent us a message praise be to God we are serving a great and a wonderful God you are not here by accident it never was and it will never be you may not understand it you have to understand it if you can understand God the Bible says it's way our pass finding out can you imagine with our human brain we want to understand god Till some people even want to prove God in the laboratory I was listening to One space scientist I forgotten his name he wrote a book and he was saying that there was an interview he was having he said um there there is there is 95% of the things that they don't know about this is a space scientist he's gone to space and come back that there is 95% of the things they don't understand they don't know about and then he went on you will think that people that have gone up there and come down you will think that they are going to fear God more you will think that they are going to see the glory of God more but this man is a hidden today as we speak I don't know of tomorrow he may be a child of God he was saying that um those things uh and of the 5% they understand that he has realized that um if time goes on the 9 the 95% of the things we don't understand we will get to understand them and he was coming from the point that uh things they used not to understand before now they understand them and that is difficult to prove the existence of [Music] God God is real you can never prove God in the laboratory God is real amen that is why the Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God and they that come must first believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him is by faith it's by faith we are called to Faith not to understand praise God if you understand praise God if you don't and that is where Faith K kicks in praise the Lord amen so but before this great judgment conference God is calling and pleading he is calling if you can hear the voice of God today it's just God knocking on the door of your heart not condemning you God is pleading with you this morning God is speaking to you is God speaking to you God having a conference with you this is not a man's work the most honorable thing there could ever be the greatest invite any man could ever experience is this invite there has never be an invite like this one here where God tells a man come and let us reason together God is not imposing himself on you because he is God and because he created you no like the people go to those conferences and they impose their ideas on us no God has the right to do it and yet he's not doing it come and let us reason together what is your problem come let us reason together what are your difficulties come let us rason together what are your headaches come let us reason together what do you have to deal with come let us reason together God knocking on the door of your heart and pleading with you this morning come and let us rason together praise the Lord hallelujah amen if the president of the United States of America should just say I want a conference with you you are going to go there very well dressed and you put up your best maners and after that you have a photograph with him and then you come to your house and you are just going to put it in front of the door so anybody coming will know that yes you had a conference with the president oh what what what what a privilege what a privilege a lot of the times before you even left the White House he has forgotten of you you go around having his picture big picture in the most important place of your house showing you and the president he doesn't even remember you anymore my dad was a soldier and he took a picture with Roland Rollins Jerry Rollins he was in the Army he was at Air Force J Rens was at the Air Force as a pilot and they took a picture together my dad left the Army and R Rollins took over the presidency in the K and he became the head of state and my dad went and wherever he dug that picture from he dug it out see I took a picture with him see we were friends and they used to have a j on because he was half Scottish and then he would tell my dad ab ab ab ab B B is in in how means white man and my dad will say no you not be B that means you're not a white man so they had that J on they were they just had that relationship so my dad took it out and showed it to us and then we go to the go to school oh yes he's a friend to my dad so no oh yeah he took a picture to my dad and then we're also bragging about it praise the Lord now this man comes to salaga a place in the northern region where we were and then my dad told the family that Rollins is coming here today and then you know when they even go on uh retirement they still have some of their old uniforms that they can put on to frighten the people in the street so um he put on his old uniform dressed he said I'm going to meet him and we were all happy because we knew that if Daddy should be able to meet the head of state our lives would change and then he goes to where he was camping in that district and guess what these are Cuban trained Commandos will not allow him he said no we were friends in the Army he showed them his picture and they saw it but they will not allow him to come in daddy came back and he was very disappointed we also got very disappointed because we thought it was going to change our lives and who knows I don't think he would have forgotten of him though but it was possible that he was going to see him and still forget but here we are not talking about a one-sided conference a conference that you would attend and by the time that conference is over your host has even forgotten you were there that only you have a good memory of that conference and your host has forgotten that they ever met you and only you have a picture of them with you and you go bragging about them and they don't even know you exist but we are talking about a conference that when you go to that conference that your host brags more about you than you brag about them that you have a picture that you attended that conference and your host also has a picture am as a matter of fact the best of the pictures that you are in the conference with him that when you are in the street and you are break in about him you are preaching about him you are blessing his name you are glorifying his name that he is of there and he looks down and he's also bragging about you and his angels are just around you keeping you that there is a constant relationship that he never forgets about you he never forgets about you his eyes are upon you by day and by night and he thinks of you every single day what put job into trouble it was because God was bragging about him when the children of God guarded the devil came in the devil was not part of the meeting right he had to be given audience to speak and God told him have you you noticed that of all that are on earth there is none like my servant job God bragging true about his own not a onesided conference a conference where God is calling you come and let us risen together come let us re together though your sins be as Scarlet they be as white as snow though they be red as Crimson they will be as [Music] wool now when you go back to Isaiah 1 which we read we didn't start from the first verse we started from 15 to 18 you can go back and read from the starting um from from the verse one you would realize that they were not a people God was happy with everything Isaiah was talking about and prophesying it was against the people God was not happy with their lives they had turned their backs on God they were not doing what God wanted them to do they were not living the life they had embraced sin and they has cast go they had cast God out God was not happy with them and you would think that God was going to say fire upon these people and God gets to this place and God says come in spite of your sins come let us reason together in spite of your iniquities come let us reason together in spite of your difficulties come let us reason together it is time to reason together it's time to reason together praise the Lord and when I was listening to the song leader this morning he got to a place he said don't let him pass you by and I had that down here that don't let him pass you by then he goes and he talks about hold His Garment when he passes You by prise God Amen don't let him pass you by hold His Garment when he passes You by I thought that was beautiful I loved it I'm just going to do my last reading praise the Lord the Judgment conference is that where we are no this is Isaiah um Isaiah 118 okay all right yeah I was supposed to take a little reading here um it's just how many paragraphs I think uh five four four paragraphs um we still have a little time I was just thinking of uh forgetting about it but we have a little time now there's a conference going on in heaven the evening lights are here atomic bombs and things are hanging everywhere and we are at the end World conferences has come to an end

and being filled with his Spirit the cir conference where every man will meet every woman will meet every child will meet there is a place select where that conference will be held and there will be a great white Throne judgment set um God has permitted His prophets to look in and said the books were opened and another book which is The Book of Life then 10,000 times 10,000s of ministers and angels ministered to him then it was written if the righteous be scarly saved where will the Sinner and ungodly appear what will be your stand at that conference you might have bypassed all of them down through your life you may walk out of this door this morning and bypass this one one but my friend you will never bypass that one you are going to be there for it was once appointed unto man to die but after that the Judgment there will be a great conference where we all stand together and we all give an account for this morning of this Earthly conference that we've held this morning the musicians can come over praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so there is a last conference that is going to be and it's going to be a a terrible conference if you have not accepted Christ the only thing the only thing that would provide us with a way of Escape is the blood the blood the blood of our Redemption the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that is the only way out that is the only ESC route that is the only Escape Route God has given to humanity for there is no human that can come in their personal righteousness Before the Throne of God you can't you dare not we are coming in the righteousness of our Lord and our savior Jesus for he alone died for us he alone let his night die done for us he alone took our place on the cross he is the Lamb of our sacrifice and that sacrifice was a worthy sacrifice once you accept him God is not looking at what you used to be God as a matter of fact is not even looking at what you are today he is looking at the blood if you have truly accepted Christ CHR praise be to God when God looks down and he sees your cry he sees your cry through the blood what a merciful father he is that is the only Escape Route you and I have which is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and we are talking of the life in the blood the Holy Ghost baptism for there is life in the blood amen do not live here this morning do not live here this morning until
