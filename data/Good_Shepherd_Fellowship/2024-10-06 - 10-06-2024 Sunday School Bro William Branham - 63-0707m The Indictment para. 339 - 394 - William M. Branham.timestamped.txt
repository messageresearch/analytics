[2:52] vulgar and dirtiness and the non-power
[2:54] of the Catholic church that's exactly
[2:57] why this nation is taking over communism
[2:59] and the generation of churches and
[3:00] jining itself up with the Catholic
[3:02] Church which Communism and Catholicism
[3:04] will unite together you know and here
[3:06] they are doing it why because they have
[3:07] rejected the gospel it separates them
[3:09] and makes them a different people and
[3:12] exactly the reason and ministers in the
[3:14] P pits putting up with it for a meal
[3:18] ticket for a social standing of some
[3:21] Creed say I belong to so and so swapping
[3:26] education for the power of
[3:28] God free them from this mad race like
[3:31] Mary magdalina the very power that could
[3:34] take that little strip tease on the
[3:36] street and make her put on clothes and
[3:37] act like a lady make a Christian out of
[3:40] her they condemn that power and crucify
[3:43] the man that had it at Calvary and
[3:47] today the very gospel in the Holy Ghost
[3:50] that'll take that little strip teas and
[3:52] make her dress like a lady and act like
[3:54] a Christian they call it fanaticism it

[4:16] then the sign that
[4:18] made old Legion put on his clothes
[4:22] remember a person that takes off their
[4:23] clothes are
[4:24] crazy how about a woman Legion was crazy
[4:27] stripped his clothes off of him God butu
[4:30] his power and made him put his clothes
[4:31] on his clothed in his right mind sitting
[4:34] down at the feet of Jesus look at the
[4:36] power that made old blind barus to
[4:39] see right among their Creeds he was on
[4:43] the earth with just much unbelief as
[4:44] there is today but never stopped him he
[4:47] went on he didn't pull no punches for
[4:49] him he told him you your father the
[4:51] devil he condemned the whole
[4:54] thing the power that could raise Lazarus
[4:56] out of the grave and gave the woman of
[4:58] naan back her son
[5:01] oh God the power that can do those
[5:05] things that can foretell the things that
[5:07] happen there's two cult cult tied of two
[5:09] ways and all these things that he
[5:10] foretold the very man that possess that
[5:13] power away with him we won't have him
[5:14] among our people he pollutes our
[5:16] teachings and they crucified him the
[5:19] very same thing today they way with the
[5:21] Holy Ghost they don't want nothing to do
[5:22] with it it condemns and does these
[5:24] things and tells our people these things
[5:26] we don't want to get mixed among our
[5:27] organization it's against our Creeds
[5:29] that I him again oh my notice now as
[5:33] we're closing we got to close and again
[5:36] they call it fanaticism and they called
[5:38] him a fanatic they said he was crazy

[6:54] Son of God with it aresh from their P
[6:56] pit amen why do they do this they love
[6:59] the Praises of man the degrees that the
[7:02] church can give them more than the love
[7:04] of the word of God I condemn
[7:07] him they can't conform to the world
[7:10] because they can't conform to the word
[7:12] because they're already conformed to the
[7:14] world they've already the hypocritical
[7:17] day that we live in is not this is not
[7:21] one Calvary enough for my Lord why will
[7:24] you do this you the supposed to love him
[7:27] you that knows this is his word you get

[7:53] judge

[8:11] this Steven's done the same thing with
[8:13] Wicked hands you've crucified the Prince
[8:15] of Life didn't Jesus say himself which
[8:18] one of your fathers didn't put the
[8:20] prophets in the tombs and you garnish
[8:22] them afterwards so has it been through
[8:24] the righteous man down Through the Ages
[8:26] so do I indict this High polished
[8:30] churchgoing bunch of Christ rejecting
[8:33] people of this
[8:37] day you with your Farms of godliness
[8:40] Crucify My Christ the second time by
[8:43] telling the people that these words are
[8:44] for some other day and it isn't for this
[8:46] day I indict you you're guilty of the
[8:49] same crime that they was on the day of
[8:52] the crucifixion repent and turn to God
[8:56] or
[8:57] perish and again I say here the churches
[9:01] they the teachers crucify by blasphemy
[9:05] him the
[9:09] Worden God be merciful let me say that
[9:12] again it might have been mixed up on the
[9:15] table here the
[9:19] churches they the clergy crucify by
[9:24] blasphemy him the
[9:28] word Wonder it's again mid rendering
[9:31] rocking darkening Skies My Savior bow
[9:34] his head and Di but the opening Veil
[9:37] revealed away to Heaven's joys in
[9:39] Endless day
[9:42] amen I say on this tape and for this
[9:44] audience I say this under the
[9:46] inspiration of the Holy Ghost who's on
[9:49] the Lord side let him come under this
[9:54] word God will surely bring this wicked
[9:57] Christ deny
[9:59] rejecting generation into judgment for
[10:02] blasphemy the crucifixion of his
[10:04] identified word am you're coming to the
[10:07] Judgment I indied who's on the Lord's
[10:10] Side said Moses let him come unto me
[10:13] when the pillar of far hanging there is
[10:15] an
[10:16] Evidence
[10:18] Hallelujah who's on the Lord's Side let
[10:21] him take up the word deny his
[10:25] Creed follow Jesus Christ daily amen
[10:29] amen and I'll meet you in the morning
[10:31] let's bow our heads now for a word of
[10:33] prayer
[10:38] hallu oh Lord
[10:40] God The Giver of eternal
[10:43] life the author of this
[10:46] word who brought again from the dead the
[10:49] Lord Jesus who properly identified it
[10:52] before
[10:53] a a generation of unbelieving people
[10:59] it's been long this morning many is set
[11:01] here the church is
[11:04] packed people are standing
[11:07] around and the tapes are being made to
[11:10] go out across the world into different
[11:12] places ministers will hear this in their
[11:15] study I pray for them Lord let these
[11:18] words fall deep into the heart cut deep
[11:21] cut away all the
[11:23] world that they might say like this
[11:26] little Methodist Minister down in
[11:28] Kentucky came to me the other day and
[11:29] said when I was heing those seven
[11:31] churches and I heard it cry out get away
[11:34] from them walls of Babylon said I give
[11:37] it up and left I don't know which way to
[11:39] go or what to do but I
[11:42] left blessed be the courage of that
[11:44] young man the wife and to a three
[11:47] children God made many find their way to
[11:50] the word of God the only way of life for
[11:54] he is the
[11:56] word I pray for each one father
[11:59] sometimes in saying these things it's
[12:01] not in cruelty it's in love because love
[12:03] is corrective Hallelujah and I pray God
[12:06] that the people understand it to be that
[12:08] way that it is meant to be
[12:12] corrective you who had to correct and
[12:14] prayed for them at the cross saying
[12:18] father forgive them they they're blind
[12:20] they they just don't understand what
[12:21] they're
[12:22] doing I pray for them ministers today
[12:24] who's crucifying the word again by
[12:27] taking their Creeds and denomination and
[12:29] dogmas and substituting it for the word
[12:32] of life and then before the people they
[12:34] they criticize the real truth that God
[12:37] is vindicating to be his
[12:39] truth we pray for them Father that you
[12:42] will call them to the married supper
[12:45] again and may they come this time and
[12:48] not find excuses or I realize the last
[12:51] call may have already gone it may be too
[12:54] late now I trust that it's
[12:56] not bless this little congregation
[12:59] present here these few hundred people
[13:01] that's gathered in here this morning
[13:02] this hot day set here for a lengthy
[13:05] maybe 2 hours or more service hu and
[13:08] listen they haven't left they sit still
[13:10] and listen many of them waiting their
[13:12] dinners and the women standing with
[13:15] their babies and they're waiting they're
[13:18] holding on to every word Lord I realize
[13:20] what'll happen to me at the day of the
[13:22] Judgment if I mislead those people I'm
[13:24] conscious Lord is conscious that I can
[13:26] feel that I'm trying to take them to the
[13:29] word and let them live by the word
[13:32] telling them that you're the same
[13:34] yesterday today and forever that the
[13:35] great holy spirit is Jesus Christ just
[13:38] in the form of the Holy Ghost the same
[13:40] man you said so a little while in the
[13:43] world sees me no more yet you'll see me
[13:45] for I'll be with you even in you and I
[13:48] know that this is you Lord and we
[13:50] believe you because we see you do the
[13:51] same thing among us we yield ourselves
[13:54] as today soberly we do here in this
[13:56] congregation and on the tapes Lord just
[13:58] as this minute May every man and woman
[14:01] boy or girl who's who's here present or
[14:04] standing outside or here on the tape may
[14:06] we at this moment make a deep
[14:08] Consecration and yield our complete self
[14:12] to the service of
[14:14] God move upon the audience Lord in power
[14:17] and heal the sick they said they had a
[14:20] little boy sitting over here let
[14:22] that great Holy
[14:24] Spirit we know just to set his presence
[14:26] like this is it'll do it if you can go
[14:29] through radio and television out through
[14:32] the lands and heal the sick you sent
[14:34] your word and heal him you can do the
[14:36] same thing at this minute I pray God
[14:39] that you'll heal every sick person ever
[14:41] crippled ever Afflicted here and hears
[14:44] these words God granted my prayer is for
[14:47] them with a with a love of Christ in my
[14:50] heart and a feeling for the needy I
[14:53] present them Lord to you upon the altar
[14:55] of sacrifice where the bloody body of
[14:58] that lamb laid
[15:00] as a propitiation for our sins and
[15:02] sickness laying there I plead for Mercy
[15:04] for the people I want to stand as Moses
[15:07] did in the breach for them Lord and say
[15:09] God be merciful for him to them a little
[15:11] longer and give them another chance
[15:13] don't don't do it right now Lord let let
[15:16] the gospel go just a little
[15:18] further they're they're condemned Lord I
[15:21] pray that your great mercy and Grace
[15:23] will will extend to the last person
[15:26] that's got their name on the book and I
[15:27] know they will it's not hard to pray
[15:29] against your Divine word against or
[15:33] against the with the Divine word I mean
[15:35] to say Lord the word that's promised the
[15:38] word that's been Vindicated the word
[15:40] that predestinated these people back
[15:42] there before the foundation word it's
[15:44] not it's not hard to to pray that you'll
[15:47] save those whose names are on the book
[15:49] because I know you'll do it Jesus said
[15:52] so all the father has given me will come
[15:55] and no man can come unless he's been
[15:58] given
[16:00] now I pray God that everywhere these
[16:01] words fall both on tape and present here
[16:04] that the holy spirit will call ever
[16:06] predestinated person just now from the
[16:08] foundation of the world when their name
[16:10] was put on the Lamb's Book of Life may
