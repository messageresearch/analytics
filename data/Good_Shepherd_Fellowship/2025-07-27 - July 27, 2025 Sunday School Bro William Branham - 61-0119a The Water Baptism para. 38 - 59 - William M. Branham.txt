TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God's an object of worship. &gt;&gt; What did you say? His name shall be called &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What was his name? Emmanuel is an interpretation of God with us. You see, that just means God with us. See, I don't mean to say there could be any kind of God with us. See, but this interpret what is the name of this God with us? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; His name shall be called Jesus. &gt;&gt; Then when Peter said when Matthew said baptize them in the Now what who is Mary and John that live happily ever after. See you see what it is when Peter turned around and said baptized in the name of repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Well he done exactly what Matthew if he said father son Holy Ghost wouldn't be mentally right. Now, &gt;&gt; why are you baptized, brother Brand? In the name of of Jesus Christ. Now, let us turn over here now and let's watch. Now, who had the keys to the kingdom? &gt;&gt; Peter. &gt;&gt; Who was it spoke on the day of Pentecost now and said, um, repent and be baptized everyone in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's Peter. &gt;&gt; All right. And the key is locked. What you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. Is that right? What you loose on earth, I'll loose in heaven. Is that right? Now, how many tribes are they of the earth? &gt;&gt; Three. Ham, Sham, and Sham, and Jacob's people. Now, that's Jew, Gentile, and Samaria. See? All right. They all sprung up from them three sons. If the God forgive me, saying if the Bible, right? Of course, that all earth was destroyed. But them them three boys. That that's exactly where our generation sprang from. Now three wise men came to see Jesus. The astronomy says that they fallen three different stars and these three stars came together and made the one star. You see and the three are one always. See now the three attributes of God makes one God. It's not God the father, son and holy ghost. It isn't three gods. Jesus Philip asked that question said Lord show us a father and it suffice. John 14 he said I've been so long with you Philillip you don't know me he said when you have seen me you have seen the father now I was explaining this to some women one day and woman well said wait just a minute brother Ben said they are one that's right said so are you and your wife one I said but they're a different kind of one and she said I said oh she said no they're the same as you and your wife one I said oh no I said do you see me she said yes I said you see my wife she said no I don't even know I said then Jesus said when you see me you see the father. So they they are different kinds of one. See I said you see me but don't see my wife. &gt;&gt; But when you see Jesus you see God. He manifested God. He was a virginborn son and God the father which is the spirit dwelt in him. Now a lot lot of trinitarian people try to say I was debating it not long ago. I find out don't do no good. Because no man can come to God unless God formed him and called him before the foundation of the world. All the father has given me will come to me, said Jesus. See, and this man tried to say he was a trinitarian extremely. And he stood up before the class and he said, "My precious friend said,"Brother Bram is a one of the finest fellas." See, you see right there, I know the Jesus said, "You hypocrites. How can you say good things for out of abundance the heart speak of the mouth?" See, and so just trying to find favor with the people. He said, "This is a church of Christ, man, and a so-called church of Christ. Of course, they're against all the true teachings of the Bible almost, and you couldn't call them I don't mean to say anything against them people in there, but them ministers are, if you'll excuse expressions like the Irishman's owl, all fuss and feathers, no owl. So, that's just about the way it is. I think just they ain't got nothing to stand on. So, a modern Pharisee. Now he said, "But brother Bham has been like a uh in this discussion said wiggle out of everything like the worm in the lemon." But says, "I would like him to wiggle out of this one." And of course all debaters holds a key note to the last part of it. So then he said at the baptism in Matthew 3, the display of three persons, absolutely three distinct persons, the son standing on the back, the Holy Ghost like a dove in between them, God the Father speaking out of heaven. I said, "Sir, is that your keynote?" He said, "I want to hear you wiggle out of that one." I said, "Sir, you just wiggle back and read the scripture the way it reads." I said, "That's the only thing. You're just mistreating the scripture to the people." I said, "That is thinner than the broth made out of a shadow of a chicken is starved to death." I said, "Well, you're just you're you're you're making it wrong, brother. You're misreading it to the people." And I said, "Now look here what the brother says." Now, I'll take it like this. Like these I got father, son, holy ghost. Now, this here it be the Holy Ghost son, Israel, Father. And watch how they read it. When Jesus was baptized, went straight way out of the water. Lo, the heavens opened unto him, and he saw the spirit of God like a dove descending, and a voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm pleased to dwell." I said, "See, three beautiful illustrations. The son on the ground, the Holy Ghost like a dove in between, and the father out of heaven speaking." See how the devil can stand there and deceive a person? If you don't have the revelation of God, of God isn't mercy to us, we ought to be thankful. He made that say something he didn't say. Just like Matthew 28:19, make them say something it don't say. He never said baptize them. He never said baptize in the name of the father and the name of the son and the name of the holy ghost. Said baptize them in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost which is Jesus Christ. Now let us take this illustration. Now let's see you're getting the scriptures wrote down. Matthew 3 there last three or four verses. Now &gt;&gt; I just depending on her right from her and &gt;&gt; you can study it when you get I'm giving you scripture so you can study it alone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now look notice now they say that was a son standing on the bank. This is God the Holy Ghost like a dove in between them &gt;&gt; and God the father was speaking out of the heaven. Now look like that make exactly three different voices in three different places. Now notice now when Jesus is baptized now we realize that heavens is means above atmospheres whatever it is into heaven. Now when Jesus is baptized he went straight way out of the water and lo the heavens was open unto him and he saw the spirit of God. I thought they said God was up in heaven speaking the spirit of God like a dove. The devil was God. See, we just got through it here. Holy Ghost and God the same person. &gt;&gt; See, it's just a title to it. See, and he saw the spirit of God, not rather God up in heaven speaking, but the spirit of God was in the form of a dove. That was that was the Holy Ghost. It was God in the same name. See the spirit of God like a dove descend and a voice from heaven which was above him saying this is my beloved son in whom I am pleased to dwell the right translation you got the verb before the adverb like all the foreign it's this is my beloved son in whom I am pleased to dwell in or whom I am pleased to dwell in whom I am pleased to dwell that was God coming into Jesus and in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily And there is your father, son, and holy ghost &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Sure. &gt;&gt; You get it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's no there's no place in the Bible speaks of three being a three gods. There's no such a thing. It's absolutely pagan. It come from pagan. &gt;&gt; That's the way with the trinity. &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, surely it's just as it's just as bottomless as hell is. See, there's no such thing. needs that. &gt;&gt; Billy Graham needs that. &gt;&gt; Oh, he was &gt;&gt; I needed it, too. Billy Graham. &gt;&gt; It's revealed to those who God calls and is predestinated by his fornowledge. All my sheep hear my voice. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; look at them Jews stand there just as scholarly as they could be. And Jesus showing them he was Messiah by Messiah sign that said he's beyond. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How could they were blinded? &gt;&gt; And drew a ragged shepherd on the hill. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and a little ragged shepherd or a or a fisherman down the river said they know it. You see, he just God has a way of doing things and we just have to cope with his way. I just be thankful that your eyes could be open to see truth. Now, I challenge anybody, not for not for fussing, but will come to me and sit down and show me trinity one time in the Bible where there's three gods. If you show me three gods, I'll show you we're in darkness and pagans and heathens. There's only one God. &gt;&gt; God the father truly we believe that he was up and above all over this mountain when he sitted on the mountain up there. Why? Even if a as much as a cow touched the mountain had to be killed. God the father but he wanted fellowship back with his man. He's trying to get man back to the Eden place where he was lost. See now the next thing he did then God the father overshadowed a virgin called Mary. And the hemoglobin, you know this by being a nurse. The blood cell comes from the male. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then somebody said, "We're saved by Jewish blood." There's not one speck of the mother's blood in the baby. The baby lays in the blood of the mother, &gt;&gt; but the blood cell comes from the male sex. So he wasn't neither Jew nor Gentile. He was God. &gt;&gt; A creative blood, not by sex desire, but a creative blood. See what I mean? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then God's blood saved us an unadulterated blood. He created himself. I mean he changed his cast from God to man and came down was born of a virgin Mary and the Holy Ghost which is God his father that overshadowed it came down and spread his tent and dwelt with us in the form of a man. That's God the son. the same God that was God the Father. It isn't me that doeth the works. It's my father that dwelleth in me. He doeth the works. See &gt;&gt; that? In me. &gt;&gt; That's right. The father that dwells tabernacles lives. This is my beloved son in whom I am pleased to dwell in. Matthew 3. See, in whom I am pleased to dwell. I am very pleased to dwell in this one. Dwell. But to occupy, come in the house and live. In him was the fullness of the godhead bodily, says the script. &gt;&gt; Image of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; That's right. The visible image of the invisible God. Now there he is. Now that's God the Father, God the Son, and now through breaking that blood cell. When the old priest in the Old Testament of the Old Order, a sinner brought a lamb. He laid his hand upon the lamb. His throat was cut because he sinned and this lamb died for his sin. Now the reason he went out says Hebrews with the same desire that he had coming if he committed adultery. He goes back out with the same desire. If he could kill it goes back out same desire hatred because when that blood cell lamb was broke that blood cell in the lamb was an animal's life. It could not come back and dwell in a human life because the animal life has no soul. But the human life has a soul. See, animal don't have a soul. We don't know. No, you don't have to wear clothes and cover up it snakeness and say bad words and you know what I mean. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; See, they they don't know it. They fell because they're under us. See, human beings are above the animal life because they're a god of the animal life. That's right. It was in the beginning because Adam named them and had power over Genesis 1:26. He had dominion over all the earth. He was he was made in the image of God and was made to be a lesser god. Jesus said so said not your law say that you're gods and if they call them gods who the word of God came to you which was prophet how do you condemn me when I send the son of god? See, there we are.
