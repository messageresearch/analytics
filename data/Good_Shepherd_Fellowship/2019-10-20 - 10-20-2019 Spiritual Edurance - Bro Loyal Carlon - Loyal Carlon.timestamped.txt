[30:10] of people have cars down in Chile and

[30:20] people have died this is just in the
[30:23] last couple of days that this is all
[30:24] just kind of ignited so we would

[42:41] morning Lord God father take us beyond
[42:45] our own thinking or beyond notes or
[42:47] beyond ideas Lord God and father may we
[42:49] just feast around your table this
[42:52] morning we just commit into your hands
[42:54] now father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:56] Christ amen amen you may be seated
[43:01] amen in my distress I called upon the
[43:05] Lord and cried unto my god he heard my
[43:08] voice out of his temple and my cry came
[43:14] you or him even into his ears then the
[43:17] earth shook and trembled the foundations
[43:20] also of the hills moved and were shaken
[43:22] because he was wroth there went of a
[43:25] smoke out of his nostrils and fire out
[43:28] of his mouth devoured excuse me I can't
[43:31] see devoured coals were kindled by it he
[43:35] bowed the heavens also and came down and
[43:38] darkness was under his feet and he rode
[43:40] upon a cherub and did fly yeah he did
[43:43] fly upon the wings of the wind
[43:45] and I love this you know we might not
[43:49] see it but God is moving we cry unto Him
[43:53] and God is moving we might not see it
[43:55] with our physical eyes but I love this
[43:57] passage because it paints a picture of
[43:59] what's happening what is actually going
[44:01] on behind the scenes that God is moving
[44:04] God is moving in our in our day today
[44:07] and it's our job to believe and to wait
[44:11] upon him to wait upon him praise the
[44:15] Lord I love this this just jumping down
[44:18] we won't read the whole passage but
[44:20] later on and this I highly recommend
[44:22] reading Psalms 18 and just getting
[44:23] excited about it the whole thing because
[44:25] it's just wonderful but jumping down to
[44:27] verse 31 for who is God save the Lord or
[44:31] who is a rock save our God it is God
[44:36] that Gerdes me with strength and maketh
[44:39] my way perfect he maketh my feet like
[44:42] Hinds feet and sendeth me upon high
[44:44] places which you actually look at this
[44:45] it's talking about like a deer but you
[44:48] could also look at it he's setting it
[44:49] like Hinds to eat mountain goats these
[44:52] guys are ridiculous rock climbers like
[44:55] we can't even match them they're just
[44:57] amazing just going up sheer cliffs
[45:00] they're just he makes our our feet like
[45:03] Hinds feet that we can get up into the
[45:06] rock where no man can follow us nothing
[45:09] can follow us were able to just get so
[45:11] anchored up in that rock that no one can
[45:13] follow us he teaches my hands to war so
[45:17] that a bow of steel is broken by mine
[45:20] arms that was also given me the shield
[45:23] of thy salvation and thy right hand hath
[45:25] holding me up and thy gentleness hath
[45:29] made me great praise the Lord
[45:33] amen I just love that passage um we're
[45:36] gonna go into well we'll just jump right
[45:38] into Matthew 15 verse 22 and 22 through
[45:44] 28
[45:46] pray for me this morning I just I loved
[45:49] what brother brother Dan was speaking
[45:52] this morning thank you brother Dan I was
[45:54] I was having a hard time this morning
[45:56] Satan was fighting me a lot but you
[45:58] started saying something and it lined up
[45:59] exactly with my notes and I was like
[46:01] praise God were on the right path we are
[46:03] on the right path and I'm just so
[46:05] grateful for that this morning thank the
[46:07] Lord Matthew 15 22 and behold a woman of
[46:11] Canaan came out of the same coasts and
[46:13] cried unto him saying have mercy on me O
[46:16] Lord thou son of David
[46:18] my daughter is grievously vexed with a
[46:20] devil but he answered her not a word and
[46:23] his disciples came and besought him
[46:25] saying send her away for she crieth
[46:28] after us but he answered and said I am
[46:31] NOT sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[46:33] house of Israel then came she and
[46:36] worshipped him saying lord help me same
[46:40] thing
[46:41] lord help me but he answered and said it
[46:45] is not meet to take the children's bread
[46:47] and to cast it to dogs and she
[46:49] said truth Lord yet the dogs eat o the
[46:52] crumbs which fall from the master's
[46:54] table amen
[46:55] then jesus answered and said unto her o
[46:58] woman great is thy faith great is thy
[47:02] faith be it unto unto thee even as thou
[47:05] wilt and their daughter was made whole
[47:07] from that very hour I want us and I say
[47:10] this almost every time is I want us to
[47:12] look at scriptures like we've never seen
[47:14] them before because we hear them or like
[47:16] oh here's the three sermons this relates
[47:19] to and we start to like we get it in
[47:20] here but we need to engage with the Word
[47:22] of God from here from our hearts not
[47:25] from our heads not just an intellectual
[47:27] parsing out and like oh you know let's
[47:30] just line up all this intellectual idea
[47:32] but it's with our hearts if we could if
[47:34] we could get the word truly into our
[47:38] hearts and live from that it would
[47:40] change our lives and it does and it is
[47:42] changing our lives but what I love here
[47:45] is you know here's someone God told her
[47:48] know Jesus told her no she didn't really
[47:54] have a claim to stand on but she was
[47:57] persistent same thing we we look at the
[48:01] the woman who touched the hem of His
[48:03] garment now of course she was a child of
[48:05] Israel she didn't have a scripture to
[48:07] stand on like I'm gonna get healed if I
[48:09] touch the hem of His garment but she
[48:11] believed she believed in their heart and
[48:14] she persisted and she Moochie what she
[48:17] stepped out on faith on that even the
[48:20] Centurion that came to Jesus we all know
[48:22] the story might Jesus said he'd never
[48:25] seen such faith never seen such faith
[48:29] how does this Gentile know how to
[48:32] connect with God that way how was he
[48:36] able to he didn't have a scripture to
[48:38] stand on there was nothing there was
[48:40] nothing in the Bible for him to be able
[48:42] to stand on yet that and yet God honored
[48:45] that faith why because he was bold he
[48:49] was determined he went and he he he saw
[48:53] that I'm gonna read this this 1960 to
[48:56] persevere it if it would be called the
[48:59] text I would like to take one word for a
[49:01] text and that is the word perseverance
[49:03] Severus Webster says is to be persistent
[49:06] persistent and making a goal to do
[49:09] something to be perseverant is to
[49:11] persist and before you can be persistent
[49:14] you have to have an idea what you're
[49:15] being persistent about and men through
[49:18] all ages that's ever tried to achieve
[49:20] something has been persistent man in
[49:24] order to be persistent I might quote
[49:26] again is to know what you're after and
[49:28] if you do not know you're not certain of
[49:30] your standing but when you thoroughly
[49:32] understand what it is what you're after
[49:34] and are satisfied you're going to do it
[49:37] then you can be persistent and really
[49:40] persist be persistent holding on holding
[49:44] on to God and a brother Dan said it I
[49:49] have this this scripture right here as a
[49:50] double minded man is unstable in all of
[49:52] his ways and that far too often is
[49:56] Christianity if far too often brother
[49:59] Branham said it he said a bet someone
[50:01] right off the street a ranked sinner
[50:04] often is more likely to get healed than
[50:07] a Christian because they come in they
[50:10] hear it and they believe it they're not
[50:12] so caught up in here with what this
[50:14] scripture and then o are they're so busy
[50:17] crunching it out so so busy crunching it
[50:21] out in their minds that they miss it
[50:23] they miss grabbing it in the now in the
[50:27] today that God said so I believe it and
[50:30] that's the only thing that matters that
[50:32] I can take hold upon that and I can run
[50:35] with it in determination in persistence
[50:39] 19:51 the angel of the Lord now the
[50:42] people's attitude
[50:44] some people make up their mind that when
[50:46] they come to the meeting that they're
[50:48] coming to find something to criticize
[50:50] well now st. and we'll be sure to show
[50:53] you that and if you come to service with
[50:57] an anxiety or an anxiousness and you
[51:01] hold on to that st. will be sure to make
[51:03] sure that you find that if you've got
[51:06] this worry or you've got this doubt this
[51:09] little pet doubt that you're just
[51:10] holding on to and you're just you know
[51:12] aha but what about this what about this
[51:15] and over note you're feeding
[51:17] you're feeding it theyíve they've even
[51:20] found this it's even science says it
[51:24] it's all over the Bible what you look at
[51:27] what you expect is what you get they
[51:30] call it in science it's the reticular
[51:32] activating system everyone all right
[51:36] everyone look around the room now close
[51:40] your eyes think of something in the room
[51:47] that was Navy can you remember what was
[51:55] Navy in the room okay now open your eyes
[51:59] and look around and see what was Navy or
[52:01] like a dark blue or blue color okay
[52:04] there's some in here huh there you go
[52:07] it's right in front of you okay now now
[52:11] I didn't see it it's funny I we can go
[52:16] through a bunch of exercises on this and
[52:18] I won't really go into it but it's it's
[52:20] literally weird we are predisposed to
[52:22] notice the things that we pay attention
[52:24] to the things that we pay and we see
[52:27] more and more of it it becomes a
[52:29] self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts is
[52:32] that you we know we all know people who
[52:34] all they do is complain it doesn't
[52:37] matter what it is it doesn't matter
[52:39] what's happening to them they're going
[52:41] to find something to complain about
[52:42] something to pick out about it's like it
[52:44] could be a beautiful day outside like it
[52:46] is right now it's like beautiful there's
[52:48] no snow on the ground the leaves are
[52:50] changing it's sunny and they were just
[52:52] all they would be talking about would be
[52:54] like oh but it's like it's a little
[52:56] chilly outside and that's just uh you
[52:58] know it'd be so much nicer and then you
[53:00] know what the same people during summer
[53:02] it's just way too hot outside if it
[53:04] wasn't humid outside and it's the same
[53:07] thing they're never gonna be happy there
[53:09] because what are they focusing on what
[53:11] are they paying attention to what water
[53:14] what are they setting their sights in
[53:16] their eyes on that's what they're gonna
[53:19] get that's what they're going to get st.
[53:21] and we'll give you something to
[53:22] criticize well now Satan and once again
[53:25] I bring up science only because they've
[53:27] just they're all they're doing is
[53:28] they're recognizing a pattern
[53:30] that's all they're doing we already know
[53:32] what God's Word says and it's true but I
[53:34] like to see those things sometimes
[53:37] because even if a man in their weakness
[53:40] and their their inability to find truth
[53:42] really because they're constantly
[53:43] running around but if they even find a
[53:46] pattern and like ho well that's kind of
[53:47] true that it shows really like the guys
[53:51] this is easy
[53:52] what are we focusing on what are we
[53:54] looking at what are we what are we up
[53:57] are we looking at our trial or are we
[53:59] looking to God are we looking to his
[54:01] word now Satan will be sure to show you
[54:04] that if you come determined you're going
[54:08] to find something good God will show it
[54:11] to you now it's your attitude dear
[54:14] Christian come determined and I think I
[54:18] threw up there the the definition of
[54:20] determined and I just love this having
[54:24] made a firm decision and being resolved
[54:27] not to change it determined determined
[54:31] and you look at this this woman was
[54:38] determined she was going to talk to
[54:41] Jesus she was going to talk to Jesus we
[54:44] talked we know the scripture of the
[54:46] unjust judge jesus said it as a parable
[54:49] for a reason determined I'm going to
[54:53] talk to God I love what brother Dan said
[54:55] this morning it's that the key
[54:56] difference is in are we asking to
[54:59] satisfy our own lusts and there's
[55:02] something else brother Perry Greene had
[55:04] brought out once that the brother
[55:06] Branham had talked with brother Perry
[55:07] Greene about three other things to know
[55:10] the will of God
[55:11] so there's motive and objective brother
[55:13] Branham taught us that then there's
[55:14] three other things is one is it in line
[55:17] with the scripture there's no scripture
[55:20] against it you know it's in line you can
[55:22] be confident because it's in line with
[55:25] the Word of God I'm not praying God
[55:27] should I open up a casino that would be
[55:30] out of line with the Word of God
[55:32] okay it's in line with the scripture God
[55:36] will give you the desire to do it no one
[55:40] will be coercing you to do it you know
[55:43] it's funny because we are
[55:44] read the scripture God loves a cheerful
[55:46] Giver no one reads the next part then
[55:50] that's actually half of a verse God
[55:53] loves a cheerful Giver not out of
[55:56] necessity but from a willing heart so
[56:00] not out of coercion not out of someone
[56:02] saying somebody needs to do this or even
[56:04] you sang man someone just needs to do
[56:06] this no and obviously like sometimes
[56:09] we're in we're enduring with something
[56:11] but in time it's your desire you have
[56:16] the desire with God's will and then God
[56:19] will provide a way to do it he will give
[56:22] you the opportunity to do it so I'm just
[56:24] sprinkling those three in there we're
[56:26] not really jumping into so much of the
[56:27] will of God more so about determination
[56:30] and persistence because too often we
[56:34] know brother branham taught us that the
[56:36] Word of God is like an atomic bomb to
[56:40] the church when Satan came to tempt
[56:43] Jesus Jesus didn't use any of his divine
[56:46] power to defeat him he used the same
[56:50] tools you have which is the Word of God
[56:53] the exact same tools so that any
[56:56] Christian can go to the word with the
[56:58] same weapon of warfare as Jesus Christ
[57:02] think about that the same weapons Jesus
[57:05] had Satan's gonna come to you all the
[57:08] time say oh well you know you're not you
[57:10] know you're not Jesus you know you're
[57:12] it's it's all you know anything you can
[57:14] do to keep you from picking up the word
[57:16] he will do it Satan has always come with
[57:19] the word to keep you from using the word
[57:22] to keep you distracted to keep us
[57:26] running angles on it well is this really
[57:29] so we're not certain we're not certain
[57:32] we can't be certain so we don't step out
[57:34] because we're not certain but if it's in
[57:37] line with God's Word why not why not we
[57:44] get too caught up in in this idea of
[57:46] well maybe it's not the will of God did
[57:50] His Word say it or not did His Word say
[57:54] it or not
[57:59] amen
[58:09] 19:59 be certain of God it steams
[58:12] strange when a person has done all that
[58:14] they can do that they have fulfilled
[58:16] every request no I'm gonna just jump
[58:18] down if you're certain of God you can
[58:21] take his word for anything he says if
[58:24] you're not certain that he is God and
[58:27] this is his is the Bible then you'd
[58:30] better be careful of what you're doing
[58:32] but if you're certain meet his
[58:34] requirements then faith takes its solemn
[58:36] rest faith cannot be based upon the
[58:39] shifting sands of man's theology but
[58:41] faith takes its solemn stand upon the
[58:43] eternal everlasting rock of God's
[58:46] eternal faith there at rests unmovable
[58:49] it knows this is Sookie this is the
[58:52] foundation of our faith is it knows that
[58:55] God is and a reward of those that
[58:59] diligently seek Him so it starts with
[59:02] that of being certain of God if we are
[59:04] certain that he is certain that he is
[59:10] and if we can be certain that he is then
[59:15] is his word true or not is his word - or
[59:19] not and if it is true then we ought to
[59:21] be able to stand up fully upon it fully
[59:25] upon it determined not waiting for a
[59:28] great move of God or some kind of a
[59:31] sensation but wholly believing and
[59:34] holding on to it praise the Lord
[59:38] perseverance 1963 now there's only one
[59:41] thing can hold this sword of course we
[59:44] know the word is the sword that's the
[59:46] hand of faith the hand of faith is the
[59:49] only thing that can yield this sword of
[59:51] faith sword of the word
[59:53] now you might have a weak arm just
[59:56] enough to pick it up for justification
[59:58] you're so weak just enough to pick it up
[1:00:02] for justification
[1:00:06] maybe that's all you can cut through but
[1:00:09] this sword of the word will cut free
[1:00:11] every promise that God made in it if
[1:00:14] they got a good strong arm of faith
[1:00:16] holding it there I believe God for my
[1:00:19] healing Bible
[1:00:20] leave God for my baptism God made the
[1:00:23] promise and faith holds this sword it'll
[1:00:26] cut her out of the rock yonder every
[1:00:29] promise of God can be cut free by the
[1:00:31] Word of God for it is a sword she had
[1:00:35] many hindrances but her faith in davines
[1:00:37] she was talking he once again talking
[1:00:39] about the same woman she had many
[1:00:41] hindrances but her faith in have any you
[1:00:43] might have a lot of hindrances every
[1:00:45] person that starts out to meet Christ
[1:00:47] will find you got a lot of hindrances
[1:00:49] but your faith don't have any faith
[1:00:52] don't have no hindrance faith has hairs
[1:00:55] on his chest great big muscles reasons
[1:00:57] raised up reasons raised up and said you
[1:00:59] know it's reasonable once again coming
[1:01:02] in and questioning the word faith pulls
[1:01:04] his muscles back and sticks out his big
[1:01:06] chest and says shut up set down the
[1:01:09] reason jumps over in a corner and takes
[1:01:11] his stool right faiths got big muscles
[1:01:13] he means what he says
[1:01:16] praise the Lord Lord Lord help me um God
[1:01:24] a double minded man is unstable in all
[1:01:30] of his ways maybe this is true maybe
[1:01:33] this is true you ever come to a problem
[1:01:36] in a situation and we're praying praying
[1:01:37] praying God do something God come you
[1:01:40] know what's what's the deal and of
[1:01:41] course it does come by revelation but
[1:01:44] there's scripture in the word for it
[1:01:46] there's scripture in the word for it
[1:01:49] I'll supply all your needs did he say it
[1:01:53] or did he not is it not in the word or
[1:01:56] is it not he did he said it now it's up
[1:01:59] to us to believe it and to hold on to it
[1:02:01] and and to to grab hold on to that to be
[1:02:04] determined to be determined because God
[1:02:08] God God is the one who brings it to pass
[1:02:11] God brings his word to pass the outcome
[1:02:14] is not our responsibility the outcome of
[1:02:17] the Word of God is not our
[1:02:18] responsibility it's our responsibility
[1:02:20] to believe it to simply hold on to it
[1:02:25] you're still with me okay I feel like
[1:02:29] I'm doing a terrible job you guys pray
[1:02:30] for me no like I can't I can't get it
[1:02:34] the way
[1:02:34] it's coming to me I can't say it I'm
[1:02:37] just I'm just trusting the Lord that
[1:02:38] he's gonna speak to however it needs to
[1:02:41] go out because like I was shouting
[1:02:43] earlier today about this so Isaiah 54
[1:02:48] the Lord God will help me will help me
[1:02:53] once again you look at so often in the
[1:02:57] scripture where David he's crying out to
[1:03:00] God and I love that he's saying you know
[1:03:02] and and you heard me and you know so
[1:03:05] often we're looking for this great sense
[1:03:07] a you know brother Dan was talking about
[1:03:09] is that we pray and pray and pray and we
[1:03:11] get an expectation on how God's going to
[1:03:13] do something and sometimes we also get
[1:03:16] an expectation that God is going to do
[1:03:17] something like in this moment right now
[1:03:19] like we're gonna get a sensation and
[1:03:22] we're like oh I just feel so much peace
[1:03:23] I know it's taken care of it's taken
[1:03:26] care of whether or not you feel peace
[1:03:27] it's taken care of whether or not you
[1:03:30] feel peace whether or not you feel joy
[1:03:33] whether or not you feel security whether
[1:03:35] or not you feel good or you feel bad
[1:03:38] it's already taken care of because God
[1:03:41] said so we are not a religion based on
[1:03:44] emotion and sensation we'd go to the
[1:03:46] Pentecostals if we wanted to do that I
[1:03:48] mean really we could go almost anywhere
[1:03:51] else and get that I mean we can if we
[1:03:53] can go to a rock concert and get amazing
[1:03:55] feelings I mean really we're not here to
[1:03:58] have a weak faith to just cut through
[1:04:03] enough to say I'm just a struggling
[1:04:06] Christian that's not us that's not me
[1:04:09] that's not you absolutely not we are
[1:04:12] more than overcomers through Christ
[1:04:15] Jesus by by the blood of the Lamb and
[1:04:18] the word of our testimony the word of
[1:04:22] our testimony we agree with the word we
[1:04:25] say we say what the word says and we
[1:04:28] agree with it beyond our thinking beyond
[1:04:31] our feelings it doesn't matter if you
[1:04:34] feel good it doesn't and it like it
[1:04:37] doesn't it doesn't matter if you feel
[1:04:39] bad certainly we enjoy it when it feels
[1:04:42] great and it's it's better to feel good
[1:04:45] yes yes and we're like oh man
[1:04:48] this is a horrible day you know we feel
[1:04:50] those feelings sometimes we're just we
[1:04:52] those emotions those waves crashing if
[1:04:55] we're made of sand it's going to affect
[1:04:59] us the waves are gonna come in but if
[1:05:01] we're a rock it's going to break when it
[1:05:05] hits us it's going to break and there's
[1:05:09] only one thing that's a rock and that's
[1:05:11] the Word of God
[1:05:12] it's unchanging unmovable it's certain
[1:05:16] we can count on it it doesn't matter
[1:05:19] that the shifting of ideologies and
[1:05:22] theologies and ideas and man's warping
[1:05:25] of you know should this be true or that
[1:05:28] be true and sir some of those things are
[1:05:30] fine what gets better gas mileage you
[1:05:32] know that doesn't matter it's irrelevant
[1:05:34] it's irrelevant in the grand scheme of
[1:05:37] things but this is true this is true for
[1:05:40] the entire ages it wouldn't matter if we
[1:05:43] went on another million years this would
[1:05:45] still be true because it's it's it's
[1:05:48] it's it's the source code of life it is
[1:05:51] connected into the universe and the
[1:05:53] galaxies and our DNA and cell structure
[1:05:56] and everything it's wrapped up into this
[1:05:59] praise the Lord
[1:06:01] amen for the Lord God will help me
[1:06:04] therefore shall I not be confounded
[1:06:07] therefore have I set my face like flint
[1:06:11] I set my face like flint I'm just
[1:06:18] determined I'm determined if the
[1:06:22] scripture says David encouraged himself
[1:06:26] in the Lord he didn't wait for something
[1:06:29] else to come along you know you look at
[1:06:32] David in that passage they just come
[1:06:34] back from a mighty battle they come back
[1:06:35] to I think Ziklag
[1:06:36] and their wives and their kids and
[1:06:39] everything just got kidnapped and taken
[1:06:41] away it's like that's a pretty rough
[1:06:43] time
[1:06:43] these men are about to string him up I
[1:06:46] mean that's literally what's about to
[1:06:47] happen I mean this is this is a major
[1:06:50] you know this is a major problem right
[1:06:52] now it's like he's about to get killed
[1:06:54] and this is the worst possible scenario
[1:06:57] and David encouraged himself in the Lord
[1:07:00] you know we you even look at that that
[1:07:03] doesn't necessarily mean that like God
[1:07:04] came down and spoke to David in a sense
[1:07:06] but he brought it to his remembrance God
[1:07:10] said this about me
[1:07:12] remember David was anointed king he knew
[1:07:16] that the prophet of that day had come in
[1:07:18] and had anointed him he was riding on
[1:07:21] that promise you look at how many years
[1:07:23] David ran away in exile like he's just
[1:07:26] running for his life literally he's that
[1:07:28] he's the song he's running for his life
[1:07:30] but anybody asks you what's the matter
[1:07:33] with me ha ha he's anointed to be the
[1:07:35] coming king and he's running for his
[1:07:37] life yet he's holding on he's holding on
[1:07:41] to the promise of God he's holding on
[1:07:43] even when you look at it you look at it
[1:07:46] as him being inspired God God God I'm
[1:07:49] crying out to you and in an instant he
[1:07:51] comes back into speaking faith and and
[1:07:55] and prays to God in spite of the trial
[1:07:58] he's going into that God will he God
[1:08:02] Don will remember me God will come to my
[1:08:05] aid therefore have I set my face like
[1:08:10] flint and I know that I shall not be
[1:08:12] ashamed and this this is the attitude of
[1:08:17] every Christian concerning God's Word
[1:08:21] you got a need there's a strip sure for
[1:08:25] it before the sensations come before any
[1:08:29] evidence any evidence comes I've set my
[1:08:33] face like flint God I'm going to hold on
[1:08:37] to this like Jacob wrestling with the
[1:08:39] angel I'm never going to let go of this
[1:08:42] I'm never going to let go of this this
[1:08:45] word applies to me I know it I can see
[1:08:48] myself in the word and I'm not letting
[1:08:50] go of you I'm going to set my face like
[1:08:54] flint and when the critics come and it
[1:08:57] might not even be these critics it might
[1:08:59] be this critic when this critic comes I
[1:09:02] will say I know that I shall not be
[1:09:06] ashamed I know that I will not be
[1:09:09] ashamed because I'm set my face like
[1:09:11] flint and though
[1:09:13] he slay me yet I'll trust in him I'll
[1:09:16] trust in him I'll hold on to that word
[1:09:20] I'll hold on to that word I'm never
[1:09:22] going to let go of that never going to
[1:09:25] let go of it and that's holding the word
[1:09:27] in a strong hand of faith talk about
[1:09:30] David's mighty men of valor there was
[1:09:32] one man of Valor that he was fighting
[1:09:34] Philistines for more than a day solid
[1:09:38] and it was so much so that his hand
[1:09:40] clave to the sword let that be our
[1:09:43] testimony that our hand clave to the
[1:09:46] sword you know we might be beaten down
[1:09:49] we might be struggling but we keep
[1:09:51] swinging that I'm doesn't matter if I
[1:09:55] die doesn't matter if this sickness
[1:09:57] takes me I'm gonna keep on swinging
[1:09:59] going to keep on fighting I'm gonna hold
[1:10:02] on to that sword gonna keep on fighting
[1:10:05] no matter what happens I'm gonna keep on
[1:10:08] fighting yes yes yes he is Mir that
[1:10:16] justifies me I love this
[1:10:20] he is Mir that justifies me who will
[1:10:24] contend with me let us stand together
[1:10:29] who is mine adversary let him come near
[1:10:33] to me you know what he's saying he's
[1:10:35] saying I've set my face like flint I
[1:10:38] know I won't be ashamed bring it on
[1:10:41] bring it on that's exactly what he's
[1:10:43] saying who will contend with me let us
[1:10:46] stand together come here come here who
[1:10:49] is mine adversary let him come near to
[1:10:51] me come here bring it on bring it on
[1:10:55] because I've got my face set like flint
[1:10:58] I'm not going to retreat bring it on
[1:11:01] bring it on bring it on yes bring it on
[1:11:09] behold the Lord God will help me who is
[1:11:14] he that shall condemn me lo they shall
[1:11:17] wax old as a garment the MAS shall eat
[1:11:19] them up who is among you that feareth
[1:11:22] the Lord that obey the voice of his
[1:11:24] servant that walketh in darkness
[1:11:26] and half no light she was talking about
[1:11:28] someone who is he that it's believes in
[1:11:31] God but is walking in darkness there in
[1:11:33] a trial the valley of the shadow of
[1:11:35] death
[1:11:35] let him trust in the name of the Lord
[1:11:38] and stay upon his god stay upon his god
[1:11:44] stay upon his god our responsibility is
[1:11:48] not to bring it to pass our
[1:11:50] responsibility is to believe believe in
[1:11:54] a surrendered absolutely surrendered
[1:11:59] trust that god i I'm jumping on this
[1:12:02] thing I am my boats are burned my
[1:12:06] bridges are burned this is the only
[1:12:08] thing this is the only thing there is no
[1:12:11] plan B there's no option B but I am
[1:12:14] totally committed totally committed I'm
[1:12:18] determined I'm determined I'm determined
[1:12:24] bring it on
[1:12:27] praise the Lord
[1:12:30] amen he that overcometh will i make a
[1:12:40] pillar in the temple of my god
[1:12:44] praise the Lord
[1:12:48] Hebrews 12 wherefore seeing we are also
[1:12:51] are compassed about with so great a
[1:12:54] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:12:56] every weight and the sin which just so
[1:12:58] easily beset us and let us run with
[1:13:01] patience the race that is set before us
[1:13:03] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:13:06] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:13:08] that was set before him endured the
[1:13:11] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:13:13] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:13:16] God jumping down now no chastening for
[1:13:20] the present seemeth to be joyous but
[1:13:22] Grievous we know the passage but
[1:13:24] Grievous nevertheless afterward it
[1:13:26] yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[1:13:28] righteousness unto them which are
[1:13:31] exercised thereby
[1:13:36] exorcised gods or coach gods or coached
[1:13:41] their exercise thereby wherefore lift up
[1:13:45] the hands which hang down in the feeble
[1:13:47] knees looking diligently lest any man
[1:13:50] fail of the grace of God and I love this
[1:13:54] I've been thinking a lot about well let
[1:13:58] me read this next passage real quick
[1:14:02] Melchizedek 1955 how we dwelt on that
[1:14:07] how Abraham patiently enduring enduring
[1:14:12] is seeing what the invisible God as
[1:14:15] though he were visible standing before
[1:14:18] him and after his endurance after he had
[1:14:22] endured the hard fight he inherited the
[1:14:25] promise now isn't it strange look like
[1:14:29] God could have just reached down and
[1:14:30] given the promise right then and done
[1:14:32] the work right then he could have done
[1:14:34] it Hannah when she was at the temple and
[1:14:37] she was praying an Eli came out and
[1:14:39] thought she was drunk and she said I am
[1:14:41] NOT drunk but I'm praying that God will
[1:14:43] take away my reproach he said the Lord
[1:14:46] God granted to thee thy request now God
[1:14:48] could have placed little Samuel right in
[1:14:50] Hannah's arms all of us know that he's a
[1:14:53] creator of all things just speaks it
[1:14:55] into existence he could have put it
[1:14:57] right in Hannah's arms but instead of
[1:14:59] doing that it was the regular procedure
[1:15:01] of nine months before the little baby
[1:15:03] come along he could have done it
[1:15:05] instantly but he didn't do it instantly
[1:15:07] he just gave her the promise and she
[1:15:11] inherited the promise when God told
[1:15:14] Moses when he started out to go into the
[1:15:16] Promised Land all that promise he said I
[1:15:19] give Abraham years ago it's all walled
[1:15:21] up with the Philistines and all kinds of
[1:15:23] great people over there warriors
[1:15:25] he said now it's all yours there was the
[1:15:28] am rights the hittites and the
[1:15:30] perizzites and all those over there in
[1:15:31] Hittites juveniles Philistines
[1:15:34] everything in Palestine now God said
[1:15:36] I've give it to you it's yours now go
[1:15:39] and possess it oh I hope you see it
[1:15:43] people it's something that I want to get
[1:15:46] to you to put
[1:15:48] faith where it belongs many people as I
[1:15:50] find they've got faith if the only
[1:15:54] knowed how to put it to work
[1:15:56] the only knowed how to put it to work
[1:16:00] and I love it brother Branham says in
[1:16:02] perfect faith is uh you don't know how
[1:16:06] much faith you got because faith is
[1:16:07] unconscious you don't know it's about
[1:16:12] putting it into action putting faith
[1:16:15] into action with the Word of God
[1:16:19] beyond once again beyond the feeling or
[1:16:22] the sensation and it's so often like
[1:16:27] let's continue on and that's the same
[1:16:30] thing the Holy Spirit is paragraph 63 if
[1:16:34] we'll just let it run its way and not us
[1:16:36] get in the way not us throw our doubts
[1:16:38] there cuz this didn't and that didn't
[1:16:40] just let God's Holy Spirit working and
[1:16:42] you rest upon the promise it'll do just
[1:16:45] exactly what God said it would abraham
[1:16:48] was an old man a hundred years old when
[1:16:50] God appeared to him in the name of
[1:16:52] Almighty God the Almighty there comes
[1:16:54] from the Hebrew word of al-sharia which
[1:16:56] means the bosom or breasts of a woman
[1:16:58] now he was old his strength was gone but
[1:17:01] el shaddai i is the almighty the
[1:17:03] strength giver and all abraham had to do
[1:17:06] to obtain this promise was lay right on
[1:17:09] that promise it's the same for us it's
[1:17:16] not in working it out or reasoning with
[1:17:19] it or trying to make it work or make it
[1:17:21] fit into our lives or trying to bring it
[1:17:23] to pass it's in laying right on that
[1:17:26] promise and holding on to it holding on
[1:17:30] to it that when the storms of doubts and
[1:17:32] life and winds assail us that we don't
[1:17:36] let go of that promise because it's ours
[1:17:40] it's mine it's mine doesn't matter if we
[1:17:44] see anything doesn't matter if we never
[1:17:46] see anything we hold on to it because we
[1:17:50] walk by faith and we walk by sight or we
[1:17:53] don't walk by sight we walk by faith not
[1:17:55] by sight after okay it's 65 paragraph 35
[1:18:00] we'd
[1:18:01] and we'd do the same thing when we come
[1:18:03] to God and see his promise we just lay
[1:18:06] write to him and draw from his word the
[1:18:08] strength of God given in its course not
[1:18:11] taking our own mind just believing it
[1:18:15] just believing it after he had endured
[1:18:19] he obtained the promise oh I just love
[1:18:22] that now the same thing works for
[1:18:24] salvation same does for divine healing
[1:18:26] how God and His great love and infant
[1:18:29] mercy give it to us now saying surely I
[1:18:31] will bless thee and will multiply thee
[1:18:33] and so after he had patiently endured he
[1:18:36] endured the promise or he he received
[1:18:39] the promise that the term in der ER
[1:18:43] literally means suffer patiently suffer
[1:18:49] patiently yeah
[1:18:56] it's there's something to that I've been
[1:19:00] so I really like I like lifting weights
[1:19:02] cuz it's fun it makes you it says the
[1:19:04] glory of young men is their strength so
[1:19:07] I want to live up to that part of the
[1:19:10] scripture amen praise God can I get a
[1:19:15] witness
[1:19:16] and then amen and it's true and and
[1:19:21] there's there's nothing wrong with that
[1:19:22] but I've been changing up with my
[1:19:25] trainer lately we've done a been doing a
[1:19:28] lot more endurance stuff like just going
[1:19:30] at it
[1:19:31] like hardcore and I'm just pouring sweat
[1:19:33] it's so fun and it's so fun and I've
[1:19:36] been thinking about this a lot this this
[1:19:39] passage of and God like I found that
[1:19:41] definition quite a while ago of suffer
[1:19:44] patiently and we've been just changing
[1:19:48] things up and you know it's what's
[1:19:52] amazing is that you know stair climber
[1:19:56] nobody likes the stair climber you just
[1:19:58] get on that thing you're like climbing
[1:20:00] stairs when I first started doing it
[1:20:03] back at the beginning of the year I
[1:20:04] could do like five minutes maybe I was
[1:20:05] like I'm done this I'm just sick of this
[1:20:07] because I like to lift things it's easy
[1:20:09] to lift something heavy once or twice or
[1:20:12] 5-6 times but do that like a hundred
[1:20:14] times
[1:20:14] they're a thousand times in its lake
[1:20:16] that gets really tiring and I've managed
[1:20:18] to to get it up to like 30 minutes 30 40
[1:20:22] minutes on the stair climber which is a
[1:20:23] lot of fun but it's it what's
[1:20:26] interesting is the mindset that it takes
[1:20:30] the mindset that it takes in the shift
[1:20:33] and I think often we take the Word of
[1:20:36] God and there's a place for that for
[1:20:38] strength in the sense of like I need to
[1:20:41] like real quick boom I got to do
[1:20:44] something and it happens and we got to
[1:20:46] do it right now but then there's the
[1:20:48] patiently suffering over a long period
[1:20:53] of time this church great example right
[1:20:55] we had no pastor for a long time that
[1:21:00] was patiently suffering we're just just
[1:21:03] waiting hanging on just hanging on to
[1:21:06] God and we all you know you have your
[1:21:08] ups and your downs but you keep enduring
[1:21:11] you keep enduring and it's funny because
[1:21:15] we had that happen some things that
[1:21:17] happen in churches don't bother us
[1:21:18] because we're like oh that's no problem
[1:21:21] it just you just don't it doesn't even
[1:21:23] bother you you don't even think about it
[1:21:25] you're like yeah that's easy it's no
[1:21:27] problem because you're just it's that
[1:21:29] that endurance has already been built
[1:21:32] it's the same thing someone who is an
[1:21:34] ultra-marathoner who's running a hundred
[1:21:37] miles like hey you want to run a 5k
[1:21:39] hahaha I already did this morning before
[1:21:42] you got up you know I mean that's that's
[1:21:46] their mindset that's their lifestyle but
[1:21:48] I was looking up the BBC was talking and
[1:21:51] was interviewing these um these ultra
[1:21:53] marathoners and these people who are on
[1:21:54] you know hundreds of miles there's
[1:21:56] absolutely insane distances there are
[1:21:59] moments when you feel very strong and
[1:22:01] you this is a quote from one of them you
[1:22:02] feel very strong and you feel like you
[1:22:04] can keep running forever he says and a
[1:22:07] couple of instances later you feel like
[1:22:08] I've got to stop this hurts so badly
[1:22:12] I can't make it to the street corner and
[1:22:14] then you push through that wall and you
[1:22:16] emerge in the other side and you feel
[1:22:18] strong again and it's the same thing
[1:22:21] with us in life it's the same thing with
[1:22:24] holding onto the promises of God
[1:22:27] we have those moments where we feel
[1:22:28] strong we feel on the rooftop we're just
[1:22:32] like I got the I got this no problem
[1:22:35] ten minutes later you could be like I'm
[1:22:38] about to die I'm literally going to die
[1:22:40] and it you know and it's those changes
[1:22:43] because we're leaning into the emotions
[1:22:47] we're leaning in it now it's fine to
[1:22:50] feel good and it's and sometimes even
[1:22:51] faith will bring about those emotions
[1:22:53] and that's good and that's fine but our
[1:22:56] sight goes beyond that beyond that layer
[1:23:01] you look at the outer court inner core
[1:23:03] holiest of Holies the outer Court is
[1:23:06] constantly what's the weather doing what
[1:23:09] is what's going on in life so-and-so
[1:23:10] said this I just smelled that from those
[1:23:13] cattle over there and you're just
[1:23:15] constantly in this waves of of stuff
[1:23:19] then you go into the inner court which
[1:23:21] is great you're eating this the
[1:23:22] showbread and you've got the you know
[1:23:24] you've got the the candlestick there but
[1:23:27] it gets smoky you gotta constantly
[1:23:29] maintain it constantly but then you get
[1:23:34] into the soul you get into this
[1:23:35] certainty where it's a constant glowing
[1:23:38] of the Word of God it's a constant
[1:23:40] glowing of the spirit there's nothing
[1:23:43] there's no anxiety there there's no
[1:23:46] one's certainty there's no confusion
[1:23:48] there
[1:23:48] there's no clouded judgment there it's
[1:23:51] certain it's certain praise the Lord
[1:23:59] first Corinthians 15:58 therefore my
[1:24:03] beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable
[1:24:05] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[1:24:09] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:24:11] is not in vain in the Lord be steadfast
[1:24:16] unmovable always abounding in the work
[1:24:19] of the Lord praise the Lord amen
[1:24:27] endurance persistence perseverance
[1:24:31] proverbs 24:16 for our just man falleth
[1:24:35] seven times and rise it up again
[1:24:40] you're gonna make mistakes who cares
[1:24:43] really that if you're a believer a true
[1:24:47] and you know it if you're not and you're
[1:24:49] still wondering you got to make your
[1:24:51] calling in your election sure you gotta
[1:24:54] you need to get to an altar and be
[1:24:55] certain get to God
[1:24:58] get hold of God and be a hundred percent
[1:25:00] certain you're right with God and after
[1:25:03] that you come to God your will make
[1:25:08] mistakes and a you will bounce back
[1:25:11] because because it's the Spirit of God
[1:25:18] in you that you're relying on it's not
[1:25:21] your own actions your own works we all
[1:25:25] how many in here is perfect you made no
[1:25:28] mistakes I put my hand down that's not
[1:25:31] me make no mistakes ever not at all
[1:25:35] see we're all agree we're all agreed
[1:25:40] none of us are perfect except Jesus he
[1:25:43] came and he did it so we don't have to
[1:25:46] the reason we have the blood is so we
[1:25:48] can live under an umbrella of grace
[1:25:52] sovereign grace grace and may we have
[1:25:57] that same grace for ourselves and for
[1:26:00] others grace constant grace
[1:26:05] praise the Lord just man falls seven
[1:26:07] times and his his reliance is not in his
[1:26:10] own strength looking unto Jesus the
[1:26:13] author the finisher of our faith amen
[1:26:32] when you've done all you can do it seems
[1:26:35] strange back to that passage 59 be
[1:26:37] certain of God it seems strange when a
[1:26:39] person has done all that they can do
[1:26:41] that they have fulfilled every request
[1:26:44] that God has asked them to do and still
[1:26:46] he is silent when you've done all that
[1:26:50] God has requested you to do and he's
[1:26:53] still silent just be sure that you know
[1:26:56] God get that sorted out be certain of
[1:26:59] God and remember faith is silently
[1:27:03] waiting patiently suffering silently
[1:27:08] waiting he's only testing your faith to
[1:27:12] see what you'll do God does that it was
[1:27:16] the Hebrew children that believed God as
[1:27:18] stood out for God and they were sure
[1:27:20] that they were right with God and he let
[1:27:23] them walk right into the fiery furnace
[1:27:25] before he ever moved but stayed wait
[1:27:29] silently assured that everything's all
[1:27:31] right when you've done all that you can
[1:27:34] do when you've come through the prayer
[1:27:35] line and been prayed for your heart
[1:27:37] doesn't condemn you and you're living
[1:27:39] right with God just hold on to it God
[1:27:43] has to answer God has to answer
[1:27:50] determined holding hold Jacob wrestled
[1:27:57] with the angel and he held on to God
[1:27:59] held on to that word held on to it with
[1:28:03] all of his might
[1:28:05] determined if you turn loose the next
[1:28:08] morning say well I'm no better I guess
[1:28:10] there's nothing to it then you didn't
[1:28:11] have faith to begin with if you've got
[1:28:13] real faith you'll hold till the last
[1:28:16] breaths gone from your body you tilda I
[1:28:19] want to say that again if you've got
[1:28:22] real faith you'll hold till the last
[1:28:25] breaths gone from your body like take
[1:28:30] that and write it on your arm
[1:28:31] or something like right in on the fridge
[1:28:34] you'll hold till the last breaths gone
[1:28:38] from your body you're certain that God
[1:28:41] is God
[1:28:43] you're certain holding on to God then
[1:28:50] you would take his word for anything he
[1:28:52] said 54 he swore by himself that's the
[1:29:06] Word of God I believe every word of it
[1:29:09] it's 8 not it's ain't not for me to cut
[1:29:16] praise Lord not for me to cut this out
[1:29:20] and that out it's for me to live up to
[1:29:22] its qualification that's all until its
[1:29:26] requirements rather if I got to live up
[1:29:30] to that for God has swore he said he
[1:29:33] that will add anything to it or take
[1:29:34] anything out of it the same will be
[1:29:36] taken out is part of the book of life
[1:29:37] that's right so we believe it don't take
[1:29:42] out from the Word of God don't exclude
[1:29:46] yourself from the blessing of that
[1:29:49] promise that's taking out of the Word of
[1:29:51] God
[1:29:53] it's amazing how Satan will come and
[1:29:56] he's just rehashing the days of miracles
[1:29:59] are past same thing over and over again
[1:30:02] he'll use a different line of oh well
[1:30:04] you know that was for someone else or
[1:30:06] you know well yeah that would it would
[1:30:08] be for you if you did this or if you
[1:30:11] really prayed through like this he's
[1:30:14] always adding additional requirements or
[1:30:17] something like that you hold to God's
[1:30:21] Word certainly you do live up to the
[1:30:23] quirements if you've got something you
[1:30:24] need to deal with God will reveal it to
[1:30:26] you he will absolutely if you'll listen
[1:30:30] and pay attention to him that's right so
[1:30:35] we believe it if our foundation is firm
[1:30:37] and sure in Jesus Christ then brother
[1:30:40] there's nothing can shake you you're
[1:30:42] just you're anchored amen
[1:30:45] oh say all right and after that the 15th
[1:30:49] verse now and so after he had patiently
[1:30:52] endured he obtained the promise
[1:30:55] oh say I don't know whether we're going
[1:30:58] to get down to that say that seventh
[1:30:59] chapter or not um after he had patiently
[1:31:01] endured Amen he obtained the promise can
[1:31:04] you do the same thing this morning
[1:31:06] can you set your faith and say it's thus
[1:31:09] saith the Lord and no matter what comes
[1:31:13] or what goes weather today is easy
[1:31:16] tomorrow is hard the next day they're
[1:31:19] teasing you the next day their make your
[1:31:20] own mind your own mind not just others
[1:31:24] your own mind the next day they're
[1:31:27] making fun of you the next day they say
[1:31:29] I'm crazy I endure amen
[1:31:34] after not before he endured but after he
[1:31:40] endured he obtained the promise amen oh
[1:31:43] my there it is you see it brother that
[1:31:47] shakes all devils and everything else
[1:31:48] away see see there it is and Satan come
[1:31:52] say oh now I tell you you're just a
[1:31:54] little worked up he'll tell you it's so
[1:31:59] amazing no matter what he's always got
[1:32:03] an answer if you listen to him he'll
[1:32:05] tell you now when you've actually got a
[1:32:07] hold of it with faith he'll tell you
[1:32:09] you're just excited it was just an
[1:32:12] emotion anything he can do to get you
[1:32:15] back into this state of disbelief I
[1:32:17] remember one of the things that in my
[1:32:19] early must have been my teens there like
[1:32:23] it was one of my walks of faith to God
[1:32:25] was I dawned on me is like it's like I
[1:32:28] had a moment where I went I because I
[1:32:31] was like you know maybe all this is just
[1:32:33] to work up maybe not if it's real you
[1:32:34] know none of this like maybe God doesn't
[1:32:36] even exist it's like all of a sudden it
[1:32:38] dawned on me is like wow if God's not
[1:32:42] real why is there some force always
[1:32:45] trying to convince me that he's not why
[1:32:51] nothing's trying to convince me that he
[1:32:53] is in my own mind there's nothing that's
[1:32:56] like constantly like God has to be real
[1:32:59] do to do it here's why God's real like
[1:33:01] nothing isn't no but there's a force
[1:33:03] always opposing that
[1:33:06] always there's a reason for that if this
[1:33:09] exists this has to exist absolutely must
[1:33:13] absolutely must amen you're just a
[1:33:18] little worked up you just you just might
[1:33:20] as well be kind of reasonable about this
[1:33:22] thing say it's thus saith the Lord and
[1:33:27] you can say that because it's the word
[1:33:30] God said it I believe it that settles it
[1:33:33] no matter how hard it comes what it
[1:33:37] looks like what anybody says I want to
[1:33:40] with patients not fretting person can't
[1:33:45] have patience and fretting all the time
[1:33:48] you just got to set your sails right
[1:33:51] straight there and walk right on no
[1:33:54] matter what takes place move right on
[1:34:00] and I want to leave this with you guys
[1:34:03] this morning we've got needs we've got
[1:34:05] sister Keisha in the hospital she's not
[1:34:08] in the hospital she out she healed yes
[1:34:11] she is yes she is good no matter what
[1:34:18] happens you walk right on because Satan
[1:34:23] will try to come in right now and what
[1:34:26] he'll do is he'll say you guys really
[1:34:28] need to get with somebody in here sinan
[1:34:30] yeah it's you yeah you're the problem
[1:34:33] you're sinning that's the reason why
[1:34:35] she's not getting healed and if you got
[1:34:37] something to deal with deal with it you
[1:34:39] need to do that you're sinning you're
[1:34:42] bad dress oh man she's not getting
[1:34:44] better
[1:34:45] somebody needs to you know it's you
[1:34:46] you're not a good enough Christian
[1:34:48] nothing to do with that everything to do
[1:34:51] with waiting on God and if if the Lord
[1:34:54] chooses to take her home he will use
[1:34:57] that to try to say see none of it's true
[1:35:00] none of it's true none of its real none
[1:35:04] of it's true but you just walk right on
[1:35:07] with the Word of God it is up to God
[1:35:11] to fulfill his word and in the meantime
[1:35:13] we are holding on to his word that says
[1:35:16] God you
[1:35:17] ed asked you said lay hands on the sick
[1:35:22] and they shall recover you said you're
[1:35:24] the God that heals all of our diseases
[1:35:26] and until until the last breath
[1:35:30] we're holding on tonight we're holding
[1:35:34] on to that and that's just it we are
[1:35:36] holding on to that how many agree with
[1:35:39] me this morning
[1:35:40] amen we're holding on to that for sister
[1:35:44] quiche and for everyone else and
[1:35:46] everything else it doesn't doesn't
[1:35:48] matter if we see it it doesn't matter
[1:35:51] you know brother man Oh talked about
[1:35:52] believing for your family and I'm roping
[1:35:55] in friends with that I doesn't matter if
[1:35:58] I see it I believe it I'm holding on to
[1:36:01] that that if I never see it in this life
[1:36:04] I never see it I know they'll be there
[1:36:07] because I believe it I'm holding on to
[1:36:11] that on the holding on to that and I'm
[1:36:13] certainly God brother branham even said
[1:36:17] he said in that same passage he said now
[1:36:20] I'm not saying they will but you just
[1:36:23] believe it and this whole Christian
[1:36:26] faith is built upon this thing of faith
[1:36:28] if people can go rub a rock somewhere
[1:36:31] and get healed
[1:36:32] how much more with the truth because
[1:36:35] they simply believed it it's the same
[1:36:38] thing with us that if we've got the
[1:36:41] truth but we're too busy parsing it out
[1:36:43] and fighting with it or fighting against
[1:36:46] it with our own minds are getting in
[1:36:48] this intellectual like college-educated
[1:36:50] age where which console like well let me
[1:36:53] check Google on that one like no just
[1:36:56] believe it jesus said jesus said when
[1:37:00] the girl when when gyruss his daughter
[1:37:03] died he said what did he say
[1:37:06] just believe only believe I love that
[1:37:10] don't do anything else but believe
[1:37:13] that's the only thing we're called to as
[1:37:16] Christians is to believe and walk
[1:37:19] forward believe trust that it's the same
[1:37:23] God it's the same I was reading the
[1:37:26] other day brother Branham said with
[1:37:27] Simeon Simeon was waiting for for Christ
[1:37:31] did told him and people laughed him to
[1:37:34] scorn God had told him you won't die
[1:37:36] until you see the Christ he was waiting
[1:37:40] in the temple he was waiting patiently
[1:37:42] in the temple and brother branham said
[1:37:44] if God made the promise it's up to God
[1:37:48] to show you it's up to God to show you
[1:37:52] it's up to God to bring it to pass so
[1:37:55] you just believe we don't get into a
[1:37:59] state of worry because Satan will come
[1:38:01] and he'll feel guys himself up as God
[1:38:04] and he'll caught just like job's friends
[1:38:07] you're a secret sinner you're a secret
[1:38:10] sinner that's why it's you're trying to
[1:38:12] bring about this condemnation trying to
[1:38:15] bring about anything to get your focus
[1:38:18] off of the Word of God anything to get
[1:38:21] your focus off of that word but if we
[1:38:23] can hold on to that steadfastly that no
[1:38:27] I'm not even going to look at that I'm
[1:38:29] not even going to see that God you know
[1:38:31] my heart I make mistakes yes maybe I've
[1:38:34] done some things that were wrong but God
[1:38:36] help me I'm holding on to your word
[1:38:39] that's it I have settled it I'm holding
[1:38:41] on to that word and that's it that
[1:38:44] settles it
