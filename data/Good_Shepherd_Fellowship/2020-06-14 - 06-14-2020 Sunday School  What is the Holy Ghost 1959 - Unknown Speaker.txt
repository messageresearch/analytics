========================================

so circumcision the Holy Spirit today circumcised is the heart and it's a sign a given side someone said the other day I just repeat this not as a joke because it's the truth but it sounds like a joke and as I've often said this is no place for jokes but there was a little German out on the west coast where we were just that he received the Holy Ghost and he went down the street and he would walk a little piece and he'd raise up his hands and speak in tongues and he would run and he would jump and he would shout and he was at work carrying all I got and his boss said to him where have you been I like those places where you have been he said you must have been down amongst that bunch of nuts he said then you think they are nuts he said surely are he said well praise the Lord for the nuts and he said do you know what the nuts play a big part he said for instance the automobile you take all the nuts out of it you ain't got nothing but a bunch of young so that's just about right you are so different when the Holy Spirit comes on you until the mind of this world don't like you in there against you and they don't want nothing to do with you at all you're a born of another world you are just as much an alien at ten times more alien you'd be if you'd go too far from regions of African jungles you're different when the Holy Spirit comes and it's a sign it's a mark amongst the people now you say then brother Brennan that sign of circumcision was given to Abraham that is true and to his seed yes all right now we are going to turn to Galatians third chapter xxix first and see how that could apply to us Galatians three and 29 and just see how this circumcision could have applied to a Gentile if we are Gentiles which by natural birth we are now the first I want to read the sixteenth verse now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made Abraham and his seed he said not and to seeds just any kind of a cell I'm Abraham seeds - no - a seed Abraham's seed not the seeds as of many but as of one and two do they and to thy seed which is Christ Christ was Abraham's seed you believe that all right now let's get the 28th and 29th first there is neither Jew nor Greek neither is our bond are free neither is our male or female for we are all one in Christ Jesus and if I be Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and her heirs according to the promise how do we take on Abraham's seed by being in Christ then we are Abraham's seed and what was the seed of Abraham as we might go on to Roman's forward different places Abraham never received the promise while he was circumcised to show that circumcision was just a type he received the promise before he was circumcised and it was a type of recognition of his faith that he had before he was circumcised now when we are in Christ we become Abraham's seed and her heirs with Christ therefore no matter who we are Jew or Gentile and the seed of Abraham the seed of Abraham has the faith of Abraham who takes God at His Word regardless of how ridiculous it seems how unusual you act how peculiar it makes you you take God at His Word regardless of anything Abraham at 75 years old and Sarah at 65 took God Addie's wording called anything contrary to it as though it wasn't what do you think the doctors thought of that day what do you think the people thought when they seen an old man 75 years old going around praising God he's going to have a baby by his wife and her 65 years old about 25 years past menopause but you see it makes you act funny the faith of Abraham and when you're circumcised that the Holy Ghost it does the same thing to you it makes you do things that you didn't think you would do it makes you take God's promise and believe God now it's also besides I see a promise and a sign it's also a seal now if you will go with me unto Romans a first I want you to go with me to Ephesians 4:30 and let's read here just a minute Ephesians 4:30 says this now you've heard so many people say that different things are seals if you go into the church you have the seal of the church I mean some people says it's keeping a certain day a Sabbath day that's that's a seal of God some of them says if we put our membership into a certain denomination we are sealed into the kingdom of God now the Bible said let every man's word be a lie in God's be the truth now Ephesians 4:30 reads like this and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption I'm going to have to get a little bit hard on this now lay down are you legalist brethren just hold quite for a little bit did you notice how long that C arised not to the next revival until the next time something goes wrong I'm kill the day of your Redemption you're sealed until the day of your redemption when you are redeemed up to be with God that's how long the Holy Spirit sees you not from revival to revival but from the eternity to eternity and you're sealed by the Holy Spirit that's what the Holy Spirit is it's a seal of God that he's found you found grace in his sight and he loves you and he believes you and he's pretty seal upon you what is the seal anyone or seal designates our means of finished work God has saved his sanctified you cleans you up found favor with UNCG's finished you're his product until the day of your redemption the sealed is the finished thing what is the Holy Ghost it's a sign we're going to get on that little later on another message the sign of Paul spoke of tongues was assigned to believers all right I'm not notice but in this the Holy Ghost is a sign I mean and the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a sign that God gave to his chosen children to reject it is to be cut from the people I'm to receive it is to be finished with the world and to be a product that God has put a seal of approval on I used to work on the railroad I here with Harry Waterbury and we would go down to load a car my brother done standing back there helped loads cars when a cars being loaded they go through that car the inspectors and if he finds anything loose water fall and break or anything that would destroy he'll not seal that car until that car is so completely packed until it's so packed down and so in order that the shaking of the ride won't bother the product that's on the inside that's what's the matter we don't get seal so much we're too loose about things when the inspector goes through to inspect your life to see if you're not just a little loose about things a little loose about your prayer life a little loose about that temper little loose about that time to talk about others he'll never seal the car some dirty habits some bow things some vulgarity mind he can't seal the car but when he's found everything his place the inspector then he seals it there be anybody open that seal and tell that car's reached its destination award seal for there it is cuts not my anointed do my prophets no harm or I say unto you would be better for you that a millstone was hanged at your neck and you were drowned in the depths of the season even to try to pin or shake a little on the least of these that's been sealed you see what it means that's what the Holy Spirit is it's your assurance it's your protection it's your witness it's your seal it's your sign that I'm headed down okay what the devil said I'm heaven bound Wow he sealed me he gave it to me he sealed me into his kingdom and glory bound that the winds blow let Satan do what he wants to gods done seal me till the day of my Redemption hey man that's what the Holy Ghost is oh you should want it today I couldn't go on without it so much could be said there but I'm sure you know what I'm speaking of now also let us turn to John 14 just for a minute I just love the word it's the truth now the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it is the Spirit of Christ in you now before we read I'd like to say a few commenting words what is the Holy Ghost it's a seal what is the Holy Ghost it's a covenant what is the Holy Ghost it's a sign what is the Holy Ghost and it's a the spirit of Jesus Christ in you a little while said Jesus that the world sees me no more yet you shall see me there I will be with you even in you to the end of the world Spirit of God in His Church what far why did he do it far this is a little own tomorrow night subject but what did he do it Paul why did he why did the Holy Spirit well what did he come for what did he come in you fall what did he come in me for wants to continue the works of God I always do that which is pleasing to my father I come not to do my own will but the father that sent me and the father that sent me is with me as my father has sent me so send you Oh the father said him went anymore the father that sent Jesus came in he walked to him the Jesus that sends you goes with you and is in you and if that spirit living in Jesus Christ made him do an act the way he did you'll have some general idea how to do when it's in you because that life cannot change it'll go from body to body but it cannot change its nature Orion is gone now in John 14 is let's read just a little bit beginning of the tenth verse believe us doubt that I am in the father and the father in me the works the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works think of it now believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also and greater works than these shall he do because I go to my father don't you see see I said there and i watch this how this comes out I read this little farther we're gonna read down about the 21st and whatsoever ye shall ask them I see I had the young and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I'll do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father i watch and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither North him but you for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you who is that spirit then what is the holy gold its Christ in you the comforter that's the Holy Spirit and when the comforter has come he will do the same things that I done while the comforter is in me I'll pray the father he'll give you this comforter you know that come for the world don't know him never will but you know him because he dwells now with you Jesus speaking but he shall be in you there you are that's the comforter shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you I will not know that's a comforter Christ that's what the Holy Ghost is it's Christ yep a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live you live also oh we could go on and on but let you know what is he he's the seal he's the son he's a confident see what all he is the seed of Abraham inherited down let's also find that the what else the comforter is let's go to first John 16:7 see if he isn't an advocate - you ought to advocate is making an advocate we have an advocate we know them first John the sixteenth chapter oh wait a minute I'm sorry Saint John it is sixteen seven I'm sorry I'm sure sorry I said that I read that wrong I got sixteen seven nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteous because it go to the Father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged mine now the Advocate found in in first John 2:12 now let's read that just a minute first John 2:12 I beg your pardon first John 1 and 2 it is I've got these wrote down first John 2:1 - to my little children these things write on to you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous who is advocate Jesus Christ the righteous and he is he is there a propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world what is the Holy Ghost it's an advocate what does and what is an advocator what does it do make an advocate it has mercy it stands in your place it does things that you can't do it's it's a propitiation or your sins it's your righteousness it's your healing it's your life it's your resurrection it's all that God has for you he's an advocate how we could go into details of that and break that down of how that one it makes intercession for our ignorance sometimes we got the Holy Ghost weak ignorant they stagger into something the Holy Spirit started to make advocate for us he is our educator he stands our he's our attorney he stands there and pleads for us we don't plead for herself because the Holy Ghost in us pleads for us the Holy Spirit given utterance sometimes his words you can't understand and he makes intercession for us that's what the Holy Ghost is when I walk in anything I walk like a little kid you walk like a little seller we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything you say oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take Christian life I'm afraid to use I'm afraid of this don't be afraid we have an advocate Lena oh he spends bias he's in US and he makes intercession for us the Holy Spirit constantly constantly making an advocate for us all the time he is our educator oh how we thank confident a seal a sign the spirit of life the God of heaven the comforter the life The Advocate what is he oh ma we could go on for hours with it now we're going to change just for a minute now we're going to ask now promised to us in the last days this advocate sealed promised everything that we have talked about him tonight with 10,000 times more he was made a promise to us in the last days they didn't have it in that day they just had a seal in their flesh as a token and a sign believing it was coming and they walked by the shadow of the law which they were circumcised by flesh the day we don't walk by the shadow the law we walk by the power of the Resurrection we walk by the power of the Spirit who is our true seal our true advocate our true comforter our true sign that we have been born from above peculiar odd people acting funny taking God at His Word calling everything else wrong God's words right that's all that's what the Holy Ghost a do you want it when you love to have it let's see if it was promised now let's go back to Isaiah The Book of Isaiah let's get the 28th chapter of Isaiah now we're going to Isaiah 28 and we're going to begin about the let's take the eighth verse see what Isaiah said seven hundred and twelve years before it come we could say a lot about this go back all the way back but we'll just start right here and see if it was promised to the church what day wasn't supposed to come up on the life stage from there be a a corruption now I remember the words in plural days the last two days the last 2,000 years now not the eighth verse all for all tables are full of filthiness so that there is no clean place search around today here to find it look around see free in that day all tables while they go to the Lord's Supper and the first thing in the material line take an old piece of light red or soda cracker and break it up and make the communion when that's supposed to be made with Holy Ghost hands a 911 brand Christ is not dirty and filthy and that represents you another thing they give it to people that drink lie steal smoke chew just anything as long as they belong to the church far be it if a man ever takes it when we're reading this sure he's reading and drinking damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body they don't live the life keep away from it and if you don't take it it shows that your own conscience is guilty he that he does not has no part with me Jesus death but all tables of the Lord has become full of Filth there's no one clean place listen if that don't picture today whom shall he who shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make understand doctrine who will understand knowledge who can he make to understand doctrine well bless God on Presbyterian on Methodist on Pentecostal on Nazarene I'm pilgrim holiness that don't mean one thing to God just another table who will I make knowing doctor what kind of doctor Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal the doctrine of the Bible who will I make knowing doctrine how do you know when you got it we'll get into that Friday night who will I make knowing doctrine I watch them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts little babies say well I'd go to church my mama belong to this church I have nothing against that dear brother now I realize this is being taped that's all right Bongo Mama's Church but listen mama walked in one light you're walking in another Luther walked in one night Wesley walked in another Wesley walked in one light Pentecost walked in another but we were walking on higher than that today and if there was another generation we'll go beyond us back in the early days when the pain was wide way wide Luther taught justification by faith that was just to bring the people from Catholicism in to Protestantism into the fellowship around the word justification by faith as a big wide fear they never moved from that along came another revival called John Wesley it shook him down from that brought her down to sanctification leave a good clean holy life sanctified by the Word of God give joy in your heart that's Chuck awful out of a Lutheran doctrine then a longtime Pentecost with the baptism of Holy Ghost a narrative that again by receiving the Holy Ghost that's right and now that's begin to shake down and the gifts and the restoration and the Spirit of God has come in in the fullness of signs and wonders into the church and shock Pentecost what is it we were so close to coming out of the Lord Jesus until the very spirit that was in it is working in the church doing the very same things that he did when he was your honor it's never been any word back from the time of the Apostles till this time my see it's wide narrow is narrow Sarah what is it just like your hand coming to a sheddeth the negative negative negative or what is it's a reflection what was Luther a reflection of Christ what was Wesley a reflection of crime look Billy Sunday's aids just ended the other day old dr. Whitley's taught lie you're on this pulpit the last one of the old school died around 90 against Billy Sunday was a revivalist to the nominal churches of his days he pull roll punches stand up there in horror all you method is hip the sawdust trail of preachers and all all of you Baptists hit the sawdust trailer you presbyterian he pulled no punches he was the Billy Graham of this day notice and then the same time it's a nominal churches having a revival what taking place the full gospel is having a revival there come forth the Bosworth brothers Smith Wigglesworth and dr. prize Amy McPherson all those look Smith Wigglesworth died one night dr. price died the next morning within 24 hours I was on the field now my ends coming down look at you don't hear much have been agreeing you don't hear much about Oral Roberts I see my meeting shattering what's the matter we're at the ears another age how did Billy Sunday come in and then they come in just after the great moody revival when did moody come in just after Knox revival when the knocks come in just after finish revival penny after Calvin Calvin after soul Wesley and Wesley actor Luther on down through the ages come as soon as one revivals over God raises up another throne for lie keeps moving like that now we're at the end of this time each man has looked at the end of his Junction for the coming of Christ but they had a lots on the farmer to the returning of the Jews sighing saucers in the skies all the things that we see today but we are at the end we are here now they know the church was a sieve power that would work in the church the same works of Christ because as the shadow becomes deeper and deeper and reflects more you take a shade farther away to shape the least reflection you get out of the shade after a while the shade gets closer closer to the tree in the shade is the same thing now the Spirit of God has worked under justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley the baptism the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and GERD is in the last day performing and doing the very same things that it did when it was in Christ what is it the church in Christ has become one and as soon as they connect together that last link she will go through the sky shopping become Wesley luther all rest on back in those days there he that first will be last he that slice will be first and there will come the resurrection we're at the end time listen that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost by justification ceases to light shadow of it the Holy Ghost by sanctification a little deeper shadow the Holy Ghost Father baptism out of it a deeper shadow now the Holy Ghost by the restoration of it's very person being in here farming signs and wonders I could do it at the beginning [Music] they'll call me a Holy Roller anyhow you might as well get started listen brother listen to this all tables are full of vomit there's no clean place who shall he teach knowledge room shali he makes no one understand doctrine damn that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts not little babies presbyterian babies Methodist babies Pentecostal babies Lutheran babies Nazarene babies he wants somebody willing to get away from the breasts nice and strong me here it comes power precip must be upon precept upon precept line upon line upon line here a little and there a little far with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to these people to whom he said this is the rest worrying you make calls are weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear the Holy Spirit if that isn't just the way it come on the day of Pentecost prophesied seven hundred and twelve years before it come here it is on the day of Pentecost comes just exactly somebody said keeping the Sabbath day I'm not rejecting their making light of anybody's church or religion but said the Sabbath day was a Sabbath of God was a resting here's the resting this is the rest he said that you calls the weary to rest this is it Philby precip suppose what is the holy ghost oh come on to me all ye that labor and are heavy-laden and I will give you rest what is he the one that comes in you gives you peace you're signing your comforter comforted at rest sealed how it's a sign the world knows something's happened in you what is it it's a comforter what is it a seal you're at rest you have it's your advocate if you something happens to you there's something I ought to make an advocate for you right quick see making intercession it's a Spirit of God living in the church prophesied exactly what it would be when it come it would be a everlasting eternal rest God made the world Hebrews the fourth chapter God made the word and rested on the seventh day that's right they they come back round honor you give that to the Jews for a covenant for a certain amount of time it's right but they go and rest one day go back to the first day of the week start over again noon start over that interested God spoke up when God made the world in six days when he went to rest he rested from then on drying that settled it he didn't come back on the eighth day and start again it was only a shadow now that was a type like the moon to the Sun but when the Sun comes up we don't need to move no more now notice this all in revelations 11 the woman with the moon under her feet in the Sun in her head oh we could go through the Bible he led the lady to show you see but what is it when the Bible said in Hebrews the fourth chapter if Jesus would have given them a rest day he would add words a spoke of it he would have spoke over their state what day did he speak about arrest come unto me all ye that Labour and I will give you rest Matthews 11th chapter 22nd verse look then we find that when we come to him for he [Music] you [Music]
