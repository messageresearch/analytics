praise the lord praise the lord and uh our brother uh andrews and sister christian are doing well i stopped to visit with them yesterday so they are doing much better praise the lord we want to thank the lord for that amen let's just uh take a portion of the word of god tonight and i want to go in in the direction here revelation chapter 16 revelation chapter 16 revelation chapter 16. praise the lord revelation chapter 16 let's just read from verse 13 relation chapter 16 let's read from verse 13. and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of the great dane of god almighty behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watch it and keep it his gambling leaves he walked naked and they see him and they see his shame amen and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon let's pray together heavenly father lord jesus we ask your blessings tonight and we just pray that father you will come take this portion of your word we know your word is blessed and father god is already anointed but lord god we pray in the lord you anoint us tonight for speaking you will also anoint us for hearing and understanding dear lord father uh may those things be said that will draw us closer to you and father god in terms of internal value lord god net of of men conception lord god father for things of internal value because heaven and earth will pass away it's only those things of internal value that will remain so we ask the blessings now in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you can have your seat i just for the a little hesitation tonight if we will call it i want to just speak on the unveiling of the three unclean spirit the unveiling of the three unclean spirit let me give it a title tonight but there are there there are a few things that i want to look into and one of the things that i want to look into uh is where the scripture says the um let me go back there to to revelation chapter 16 the scripture make us to know that these three unclean spirit is gathering the entire world to the battle of armageddon praise the lord this three unclean spirit is gathering the entire world and that's what i want for us to look at tonight three unclean spirit like frogs that come out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the beast out of the mouth of the false prophet praise the lord amen and we know the dragon is the devil the beast is rome the false prophets i order all of the ministers that are under that influence praise the lord now to see that there is a teaching that is gathering the word the religious word for the battle of american is is very serious now so we see this from the scripture and we also see from from the message we will read that to you tonight share that with you which of course you you know there where brother branham says the second spirit that will lead the world to the battle for my guidance is rock and roll now to see how rock and roll is going to influence the unconverted world and how uh this three unclean spirit is going to influence the religious world then there is only one way of escape praise the lord there is only one way of escape and way of escape is come out of her the way of escape is to respond to revelation chapter 18 come out of her mind people so it's we we either come out of uh the the influence of the word and also come out of the influence of the church are we together amen the reason why this is uh it's kind of for caught my attention i was reading something in the book of aazai while i was studying i'll share that with you too and uh [Music] it's it's uh it's it's very striking you know because the people don't realize that they actually honor a spirit there is no man that is that is that is neutral the decision we make and things that we do we are influenced we are getting our influence from somewhere praise the lord all the decision that is made in politics and everything that is you know that is the the world leaders are doing you know they have no idea that they are under an influence there is only two power one of two power that is governing this world it is either the power of the devil or you are under the power and the influence of god there is no neutral ground praise the lord there is no neutral ground and to see here that uh that uh the scripture here making us to know these three unclean spirit out of the dragon like i said revelation chapter 12 is satan the beast relation uh chapter 13 17 there we realize that is uh is the catholic church and uh and out of the mouth of the false prophets which of course are the people that are propagating their teaching for they are the spirits of devils working miracle which go forth in unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of the great dane praise the lord and then the voice of god the voice of jesus just like the way john put it or the writers of the bible they have that in in in in real letter and says behold i come quickly blessed is he that watch it and keep it his garment praise the lord keep our garment from the steam of those influence praise the lord and because it's it's a spiritual influence uh is is requiring us uh uh ammon at least he walked naked and you see his shame now uh let me let me share with uh with you first uh if if the sisters can be able to pull put our our coach that we want to share with you tonight uh from baptism of the holy ghost let's let's share that with you and then we can go into our hesitation is just an exhortation tonight praise the lord the lord the lord amen what a wonderful wonderful savior with yourself from the baptism of the holy ghost brother branham says the places where i have been how does fortune tell us work how does evil spirit travel i want you to i want you to believe me as your pastor because you are the one i'm speaking to devils travel in the name of the father son and the holy ghost praise the lord this will kind of a sound buffering to you to many many people but devils travel in the name of the father's son and the holy ghost they cut feathers and everything else and throw spell on each other through the name of the father son and the holy ghost it's true it's written there in the scripture you know uh matthew chapter 18 under the the first commission you know jesus said that now go and and and teach our nation baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost but we know that the early church grabbed the revelation of death amen we know the early church grabbed the revelation because there is nowhere in the scripture anyone was baptized in the name of the father son and the holy ghost but the thing about it here is that [Music] the when when pagan rome was trying to associate itself with the church they kind of profit on this scripture to be able to bring the the uh the uh um idol gods into uh to mix it with christian faith i think most of us we know all of that but the thing that is here is that uh uh [Music] now realizing this it put us to the place where it gave us a kind of a check where uh you know we realized that there are a lot of things that have become like a cliche for the church you know things are just used you know i mean when a person says you know the name of jesus it just sounds like well i think he must be a christian if now he's not you will not be using the name of jesus praise the lord let me let me share something with you it's a it's all missionary story and uh this this this uh old preacher you know uh uh i mean he was like uh like a satellite preacher he goes around preaching on his horses and and he taught his horses to be able to to uh to listen to him you know certain words he would say and they will be able to listen to it and uh uh and he had he had this hurts that would really gets to running i mean it will it will put his you know legs in the air that would jump and do different things when he says hallelujah you know when he says hallelujah that horse just go jumping you know it just get in and get and he says hallelujah it goes chomping you know just like that and then when he says amen the hearse comes to a stop amen that's how he taught that hurts how to how to ride but then it came a time where he got older and uh and someone wanted to buy the rehearsal he told the person you know this is the way to get the hearse running and uh and and the guy tried tried and and he you know he enjoyed it and he bought it rehearsing started going and he went for the ride but uh the thing there is that he really never uh i mean he just got so excited so he he decided that i mean this is this is wonderful this this is never seen but you have to realize also that this preacher had a relationship with the hearse you know i mean i mean he he have used it on many traits you know and and he there was there was a connection there's those words were not just a cliche to the to the minister and this this young he bought the hearse and he decided to take the hearse on the mountain and as he kept you know as he kept saying hallelujah her skip kept going in you know and and going in i mean running and you know just i mean and you were just enjoying the rock then he taught oh my goodness how am i going to bring it to stop you know and it's almost like he kind of forgot you know and he started trying different things now one there is that it shows that he did not have a relationship with the hearse and another thing there is that uh uh saying hallelujah to have the hearse going was just a cliche praise the lord but the hearse was growing almost to a cliff you know and then he was going through his mind oh my goodness i forgot what you know and then then he remember just when the hearse was getting to the cliff he remember that is amen and he says amen and the hearse came to to his top so wow hallelujah [Music] let's talk about the rest of the story come and meet me in the office now that's what happened you know to many christians you know certain words become cliche you know and people say amen now even understanding what the preacher is saying they just say amen because if he that you say amen to wait but sometimes those things throw you over the cliff we'll talk the rest of the story now so jerry said that brother branham is telling us and he's he's actually he's actually telling us from traveling experience this is not this is not really in the book he says from the places that i have been and i mean i could throw some few experiences in there uh uh you know and and and you know you have you have different different groups you know and then and and they all bring their strange worship right back to catholicism that's right amen they bring their strange worship right back to catholicism it will be it will be surprising to you that even uh uh some of the the islamic approach goes right back to catholicism praise the lord the rolling of the beast in your prayer it goes back to catholicism are we together now so it's it's uh you know like brother branham says here he says uh he says he says he's listen to me on this you know devil travel in the name of the father son and the holy ghost now it does not make father son and the holy ghost wrong praise the lord but these these impersonators are wrongly they are disguising themselves they are disguising themselves now let me show you the thing that that kind of a drew me drew me to this i'm all i'm all over the place here tonight so forgive me please isaiah chapter 47 you know you you never get used to being behind the poopy so you get so nervous every time now isaiah chapter 47 opens here come down and and and sit in the dust all virgin daughter of babylon sit on the ground there is no throne all daughters of the guardians for thou shall no more be called tendon tender and dedicate now this is a composition this is a word of the law to babylon and you can read the rest of it realize i'm getting out of my time here and but i i want to pick up something here as you read and you go along you will realize that verse 7 and thou sayeth i shall be a lady forever remember now babylon is saying i will be a living forever now god is bringing this word on bible let's let's let's read let's read let's read a few more verses then we will get uh created a good context here verse two take a millstone and and and uh grand mill uncovered that locks make their delays uncover that tie pass over the river that nakedness shall be uncovered ye that shame shall be seen i would take virgins and i will not meet thee as a man as for our redeemer the lord of hosts is his name the holy one of israel sit down silence and get into the darkness all daughters of the cardinals now you see god is actually saying to babylon i will punish you i will expose you amen i will punish you i will put you in the dust i will expose you but see her respond and thou said i shall be a lady forever so that thou did not lay these things to heart neither did remember the little end of it therefore here now this thou that i give into pleasure and dwell it carelessly they are serious in the heart i am and none is beside me i shall not sit as a widow neither shall i know the loss of children now babylon is saying i'm not going to be a widow amen as the ages go i will always have children i have a way of drawing them to me i will not be a widow i'm a lady i know what to do that's what she's saying to god i know exactly what to do so in every age i will have my influence i know exactly what to do so it's a spirit it's a spirit are we together now that's the thing that kind of caught my attention on this that's the thing that is that that caught my attention on this revelation chapter 17 verse 2 let us know that you know she have committed a fornication with the kings of the earth a man should have got the nation drunk with a wine of a fornication and brother branham taught us all of that what it means her influence has gone out are we together how influence ah it's all over the place you can see it in politics get in the business world you can see it in the business world and her influence is pre-dominating the church that is the reason why christ is the mystery of god reveal the threefold purpose that brother branham taught us in christ is the mystery of god reveal it's only the bride we bring preeminence to christ now if if if babylon if this spirit is seen i'm not going to be a widow i'm going to be a lady no i'm not going to be challenged she has her influence everywhere yeah i i wouldn't even bite my tongue to say there are a lot of people sitting under the message that i honor this influence praise the lord anything shocked there is no neutral ground anything shot in lack of the holy spirit you are under the other influence praise the lord i mean you can put a title on your forehead you know the bride of christ the message of the hour the ego age it's not the name you call yourself it's the influence that you are honored it's the influence that you honor are we together so brother branham says uh they caught feathers and everything the troll spells on each other through the name of father son and the holy ghost and uh they call it the three high names now what he's talking here is is demonology what he's talking about here is demonology time is not on our hand to go into that tonight you know the the mother of uh of faith is catholic church they go to these little statues and they knee down and they caught feathers with caesars and they turn their back and throw spells on their neighbor you know and and and all of them in all of that we know you know uh uh brother branham identify what those three unclean spirit is the trinity doctrine you know but uh uh this is this is in a more broad form to see how that doctrine is is the influence of every false religion of every false religion of any of everything that take people away from christ praise the lord and hear he said revelation is telling us is drawing the people away from christ and yet preparing them for the battle of their destruction preparing them for their destruction praise the lord okay i have a few minutes here stay now the beautiful thing there in the scripture is the other you know structure don't stand alone you know like uh brother brandon would say let's let's look at something here also there with me tonight praise the lord amen revelation i know matthew chapter 13 matthew chapter 13. matthew chapter 13. let's read verse 33 another parable speak he unto them jesus speak unto his disciples the kingdom of heaven is like onto living which a woman talked and hid it in three measures of wheat till the hole was living praise the lord in the church ages brother branham brought this scripture in us chapter 2 when the mess multitude came into the church amen he says that's where the living was brought into the church by that miss multitude that joined the church just like the miss multitude in in in moses exeter but then also brother brandon make us to know the the the three measure of meal was the trinity doctrine are we together the three measure of meal till the whole was living and yet jesus liking this to the kingdom of god which of course the mistreat of the kingdom of god brother branham says is the masonic kingdom which is a type of the church so the kingdom of god in this parable was the church in type are we together amen the kingdom of heaven sorry uh yeah so we we see that i mean it's all through the scripture it's all through the scripture the last time we run a parallel of babylon and in jerusalem uh i write from the beginning so uh but we realized that uh this is saturn mechanism what he's using to prepare his people the scripture says the two spirit will be so close that if possible the iliad will be deceived we thank god that by predestination is not possible praise the lord because the lord knows those that are hate amen and he have preserved us for that for that then praise the lord let's take another court here a shame of him brother branham says don't be ashamed of him in this generation sinful perplexed the last generation that will ever be on earth this sinful adulterous and fall of all petrified souls all everything that's been decent has become indecent national politics felt nations are broken up way back in the jungle of africa the sapphire hunters he says uh they had to take high power radio to to to year ever presley and pot born and and and today we can say all the rap music has all gone to this jungle they love the beats it has all gone there praise the lord what took he did the same spirit and them guys with the rock and roll and twist the natives trying to see them at alone checking their heads you know just like what you see all the boys doing with the rap music moving their heads up and down acting like that the natives stood and looked at it but you see they are not american like pat bone and eva presley and ricky nelson and this and and and them guys are he says talking to these guys he says that they are judases of of that type see it's a spirit it's a spirit and the spirit is not only in america it spread itself all over the world to bring them to the battle of armageddon praise the lord so you see that's the reason why they unconverted church that don't have the word to feed the people what what they use just music just entertaining that's the reason why you cannot tell the difference between the music of the church and the music of the world why because they are all under the same spirit preparing the people praise the lord now if ever if a father the the the the the influence if the influence of those three unclean spirit is preparing the entire world what a church word or natural word they are all under that influence then there is a spirit also to prepare the bride praise the lord there's a spirit to prepare the bride for the rapture amen there's a there's a spirit to prepare the bride to face her own the greatest battle that is going on because you have to get out of here are we together now you will see in in the book of revelation the beautiful thing here is that there's there's something that is that is uh uh a little bit out of my on my uh kind of a step over here from my notes but you will see here that in revelation chapter 16 there's a spirit there is an anointing that expose the three unclean spirit amen there is an anointing that exposed the three unclean spirit and what is that anointing is the anointing of christ amen when he said behold i come quickly now you see just just by inspiration the way the scripture is placed amen when it talks about the on the unclean spirit verse 14 talks about you know there will be working miracles and in all the kings of the earth and the whole earth verse 15 comes in and says behold i come as a thief whose voice is there that's the voice of christ amen and if it is the voice of christ then it is the same voice in revelation chapter 3 14 which means at the coming of christ at the revealing of christ in the end time this unclean spirit will be exposed that is the reason why it took the ministry of brother branham to tell what the unclean spirit is because it's the ministry of jesus christ are you seeing the connection just at the time were the spirit these three unclean spirit as as as as his revere to john is is is is preparing the people for the great day right in the middle just look at his right between verse 14 and verse 16 before the the the whole explanation the spirit will gather them for the great day but right in the midst of that behold i come as a thief praise the lord even the expression of coming as a thief is an expression that is tied to the rapture so their spirit these three unclean spirit could never be exposed in no time it has to be in the rapture in time so right in that time the ministry of jesus christ is going to expose these three unclean spirits it's going to make us to know what really it is what is a purpose are we together now so if this if this revelation 16 verse 15 is tied to revelation chapter 3 the ministry of jesus christ in the laodicea church age that's what i'm talking about praise the lord then you can see why in revelation chapter 4 there was an emphasis of speaking about one on the throne when john looked after he was caught out of the age come up higher he said when i turned a look i saw one on the tron are we together because what is what has been described here by john is unhappy it is something that is happening in the last church age it's something that will be revealed in the last church age in a time where he will come as a thief in the night it's a rapturing statement one will be two will be sleeping i would take one i will leave one that's a rapturing statement so it's the same voice that is speaking in revelation chapter three is the ministry of jesus christ now but then in revelation chapter 3 after the church ages revelation chapter 4 comes from the scene and the bible says and john says i had a voice that said come up higher the same voice that spoke to john and says i will show thee what the meaning of these things in the church ages is the same voice that is telling him now come come up higher and when john was caught up higher in revelation chapter four when he looked he only saw one on the throne praise the lord he only saw one on the throne are we together now so it put us to the place where that is the reason why the truth understanding the true understanding of the godhead not just church understanding this is the way our church i believe it praise the lord because the godhead holds your identity because jesus said in that day you will know that i am in the father amen i am you and you in me are we together so it's uh is uh it holds the identity of the true believers praise the lord there are some other few things i could go into tonight but the time will not allow us but just like we spoke uh i mean a couple of months ago if i can remember you know uh talking about you can make jesus his own father you see that's that is the danger that comes in when many you know around the message that i understand you know what jesus is god they just take that thought of jesus is god and now following the proper teaching of what brother branham taught are we together because it holds the identity of every son and daughter of god praise the lord jesus said in saint john chapter 1 he says he came unto his own and his own receive him that but as many that receive him he has given them power to become sons and daughters of god amen no we were already sons and daughters of god we were already sons and daughters of god so you see the revelation of the godhead restore our sonship empower us praise the lord to know that we don't belong to an organization we don't belong to a church we don't belong to a pastor we belong to god there is just only one mediator between god and man that's the man christ jesus oh my goodness that's that's another subject in itself that's another subject in itself praise the lord is another subject in itself there is only one man one mediator between man and god the man christ jesus so you see yeah you know we don't we we we shouldn't at because we're living in a day where the scripture says he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit says praise the lord and let him hear what the spirit says to the church and make sure you are hearing from the spirit when you say amen or you say hallelujah because you might find yourself going off the cliff or you must find yourself stopping that power from carrying you any further you're not just going by cliches you're going by revelation because you hear him speaking to you it's just like that little boy i've never seen a mirror and he comes he says that's me he was not seeing anyone else in the world he was seeing himself he said that's me papa come and see that's me praise the lord i used to say back before if you look in the mirror and you see someone else i mean you go fist in your head and you look in the mirror and see someone else you might be strong not to yell praise the lord or you it will have to be some kind of a contrary spirit that would be bringing somebody else instead of bringing yourself in the mirror praise the lord but let's wrap this up tonight so that won't keep you long just watch this the influence that this word is honor it's such a strong influence it's such a strong influence because babylon has said i'm not going to be a widow i would find some kind of a system to get marital i would i would give birth to children and every organization is giving birth to babylon every organization every religion roots run right back to babylon so you see the call of revelation 18 4 come out of her my people and be not partaker that call of revelation chapter 4 because brother branham says he says he says revelation chapter four is tied to revelation at uh revelation chapter eighteen four that's what i wanna say revelation chapter eighteen four he says when jesus was standing at the church door in revelation chapter 3 he said behold i stand at the door and knock praise the lord he said because the church closed its door on him he says then that's when the voice of revelation chapter 18 4 went out and said come out of all my people praise the lord if you if you follow brother branham ministry you will you will also see that in the early part of brother branham ministry he told the people stay with your church be loyal to your church a little part of his ministry he said come out of that he said come out of her yes sir why because it was the voice of revelation 3 20. are we together that's the reason why you realize that brother branham influenced messages that he preached he ties it to revelation to isaiah chapter 6. amen and we and and uh who were those beings that was having influence on isaiah they were heavenly beings praise the lord who were those beings that were having influence on isaiah they were heavenly beings and that's the reason why it took seven injures to bring our influence our influence is coming from the opening of the seals praise the lord now if i drop back a little bit till sunday that's the reason why i said on the treasure is what we are treasuring in the revelation of the world is what we are treasuring in the opening of the seals is what we are treasuring because that's where our influence is coming from praise the lord read the book of isaiah you will realize right after uh isaiah chapter 6 his ministry changed he was looking to the future isaiah chapter 7 behold a virgin shall conceive his ministry was no longer an affluent ministry again he started prophesying about the future about the millennium about the judgment to come he was taken from earth by those angels yet on earth but he was taken from earth praise the lord amen you might see us walking around here but our influence is from above we might be going to the same grocery stores like them but we are not on earth praise the lord because where your treasure is there your heart will be gathered [Music] if your treasure is in the world your heart will be wherever the man goes he thinks about his treasure his treasure is on his mind we see the influence that is on this word young people the spirit that is on this word is not something to desire why i cannot be like young other young people because you are not called to be like other young people you are called to be like jesus christ you are called to be like the word in your age of course they are not going to understand you because their influence and your influence is too different influence and man looks like there is no pressure on them they are preparing for their battle while you are fighting your battle you are fighting your battle which is the greatest battle ever fought while their influence is preparing they are preparing them for their battle and is preparing them for destruction musicians you can come if the lord gave us grace we will continue amen that's the reason why we want to keep our eyes on jesus amen we are conforming to his image he's the one that is having influence on us i mean sometimes you you you hear people talking you know and and it gets so adamant and it gets so argumentative you know trying to prove that their understanding of the godhead of of one god is not as much as as as trinity doctrine now think about it like this the muslims believe in one god that they call allah but yet they are under the influence of a trinitarian teaching amen the buddhists believe in one god but yet they are under the influence [Music] praise the lord why because they believe in one god that they don't have an identity tone their god is estranged from them our god he's in us and we are in him our identity goes back to him the age is closing up people since the age is closing up these influence are becoming strong they are becoming strong can you believe people that preach this message are turning back to go back to preach trinity and doctrine they said well we don't believe in the trinity anymore but if you leave the revelation of jesus christ you are getting right under that influence there is no middle ground there is no middle ground you are either under the influence of christ or you are under the influence of the three unclean spirit believe whatever you want to believe [Music] let me tell you something the influence of jesus christ will change you from glory to glory you will feel the effect [Music] you will feel the effect of the influence of jesus if you think you are honor his influence and you have arrived and nobody can teach you anything different you know what you need to know you better check that influence because the influence of jesus will move you from glory to glory it will give you a constant desire for god you will get a thirst like you have never had before turn your eyes look for in his wand of full faith the face of earth we grew strange of his glory and grace have on jesus look in his one and the things of earth we grow strength [Music] buy our house together now let's pray lord we need more influence more of your influence
