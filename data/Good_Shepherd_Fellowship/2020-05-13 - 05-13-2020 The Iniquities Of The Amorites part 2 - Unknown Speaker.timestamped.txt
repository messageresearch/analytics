[4:29] God a man trustview I was certainly a
[4:33] beautiful day today and trust that you
[4:35] had a chance to enjoy it before we go to
[4:39] prayer just wanted to mention that I was
[4:43] listening in on the governor's
[4:46] announcement at 6:00 p.m. tonight and I
[4:49] don't get into politics but I certainly
[4:51] want to try to keep up on what he's
[4:55] mentioning about the Cova and staying
[4:58] home and and he announces this evening
[5:01] that that the staying home orders will
[5:05] end at midnight on Sunday nights all
[5:10] starting Monday the stadia will not stay
[5:14] at home anymore but of course make sure
[5:16] that you go on there take a look at some
[5:19] of the good advice that they're giving
[5:21] and I know that he talked about you know
[5:25] I had having no more than 10 people
[5:27] gathering together but that's a lot more
[5:29] than what we've had so far so amen so
[5:33] we're grateful for that and we certainly
[5:36] should be on the top of our list to pray
[5:39] for that to ask our Lord who's a
[5:43] merciful God to you
[5:45] put that Satan in his place
[5:48] amen stop him in his tracks amen so I
[5:53] don't know what you have on your heart
[5:55] tonight but you know the Lord does know
[5:59] the scripture says that he knows even
[6:02] before we ask what we have need of and
[6:04] so but yet you think about blind
[6:07] bartimaeus and how that he started
[6:09] crying out and then Jesus came to him
[6:11] and yet he still turned to Bartimaeus he
[6:14] says you know what asked him what his
[6:18] desire was even though it was very clear
[6:22] that of what was his need but yet he so
[6:29] he still asks us to to actually let him
[6:35] know what our needs are he says cast
[6:37] every care on him for he cares for you
[6:40] so let's go right to prayer this evening
[6:41] you have an unspoken request let the
[6:43] Lord know lineup of did am heavenly
[6:46] father first of all or do you want to
[6:47] just pray O Lord against this demon
[6:49] called the coronavirus Lord Satan
[6:54] you're defeated enemy and Lord Jesus we
[6:58] pray God that you'd put Satan in his
[7:01] place Lord and stop him in his tracks
[7:03] and we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[7:06] father we just want to pray for any
[7:09] unspoken requests and it beyond the
[7:10] scenes hearts tonight Lord you know
[7:12] everyone Oh Lord Jesus we just thank you

[7:30] spiritual financial whatever our needs

[20:36] praise the Lord you know we were talking
[20:39] a little bit in and then he acts mean he
[20:41] says brother Warren did you recorded
[20:43] that message you preach for us I said no
[20:46] I didn't record it this is all man the
[20:49] message was so good and we didn't record
[20:52] it so I said well let me tell you the
[20:54] truth as I preached a message with one
[20:58] eye closed one eye open he he said he
[21:04] said there was something you said it
[21:07] sounded like revelation Terry - when I
[21:12] heard that it's a what revelation 32
[21:14] noburo one is diet I told him Isis it
[21:25] was poured I preached or neighbor
[21:27] brother man but I told him I said the
[21:34] inspiration faraman and I came to church
[21:36] and I preached the message better than I

[21:47] said we will want to announce to the
[21:49] church our good friend but a mirror
[21:53] Anora

[22:08] had here in Minneapolis and we had all
[22:11] those ministers passing through speaking

[29:46] Amy Amy praise the Lord praise the Lord
[29:54] amen let's just turn to our Bibles I
[30:00] want to go back and sister fade I will
[30:03] maybe name this or tie to this a part
[30:12] two of the iniquity of the AMA writes
[30:17] there's a principle a biblical principle
[30:21] that I saw while I was studying the
[30:27] subject and and and and their biblical
[30:38] principle kanafeh bring out this subject
[30:45] in a way that brought Branham torrid
[30:47] true through the through the message you
[30:50] know Bourbon talks about the the the
[30:53] iniquity of the a mirage nap in for wish
[30:56] of course that was what God to Abraham
[30:58] in Genesis chapter 15 he see was so John
[31:02] and before they come back to to inherit
[31:06] Elaine the the iniquity of the amorite
[31:10] who fall but then when the Prophet
[31:13] brought it over and and was comparing
[31:16] the true the the church ages into our
[31:19] time that we are living in there is
[31:22] there is something that he you know that
[31:26] he said and that's what I want for us to
[31:29] look at tonight that's what I want for
[31:35] us to look I want for us to look at that
[31:37] principle - now let just an honorable
[31:38] feed we will read a word let's take
[31:41] Georges chapter 11 George's chapter 11
[32:00] judges chapter 11 we will read from
[32:03] verse 19 judges chapter 11 now last week
[32:12] when we spoke on this last wee Wednesday
[32:14] we read numbers 21 21 this is just a
[32:18] repeat of numbers 21 21 but it brought
[32:23] us something that I want to use this
[32:27] evening as my inspiration numbers I mean
[32:32] I mean sorry George is 11 verse 19 and
[32:36] his recent messenger on to see on King
[32:40] of the ammonites the king of his brawn
[32:46] and Israel said unto Him let us pass we
[32:51] pray thee through the lane into my place
[32:56] now I want for us to look at that is
[32:58] really saying we want to pass through
[33:01] your lane into my place they have not
[33:05] got that yet but based on the promise
[33:08] that God has given them they are
[33:10] claiming the promise what an expression
[33:14] of faith I want for us to keep there
[33:16] also but see whom trusted not Israel to
[33:21] pass through his course but see on
[33:24] gather all his people together and page
[33:30] to Jay Haas and fought it and fought
[33:34] against Israel now watch this and the
[33:39] Lord God of Israel delivers in him and
[33:43] all his people into the hand of Israel
[33:47] and they smote him so Israel possess all
[33:53] the land of the amorite their
[33:59] inhabitants of that country and okay let
[34:06] me read them a little bit and they
[34:07] possess all the cause of the amur rights
[34:11] from Amon
[34:13] - Jabar and from the witness even onto
[34:17] Jordan now this is the principle I want
[34:20] for us to dwell on tonight so now the
[34:23] Lord God of Israel have dispossessed the
[34:29] amorite from before his people Israel
[34:33] and ensure that there possess it
[34:38] praise the Lord I want us to do er
[34:41] tonight on their principle of God this
[34:44] dispossessing they a mirage let's pray
[34:46] together father we have read your sacral
[34:49] wording and we want to just commit this
[34:51] evening in your hands and father we pray
[34:54] that Lord you would come and you will
[34:57] help us Lord as we approach this subject
[34:59] tonight
[35:00] bless your word now we love you and we
[35:03] appreciate you in Jesus name we pray
[35:05] amen
[35:07] praising Lorna and Matthew chapter 13
[35:12] Matthew chapter 13 I want us to look at
[35:19] their principle in the New Testament
[35:21] Matthew chapter 13 because when when
[35:32] brother Branham talks about the a
[35:34] variety he he placed them in a place of
[35:39] of the denomination churches he placed
[35:42] them in a place of the church that comes
[35:46] before the church that has the revival
[35:49] Israel was the one that the had a
[35:51] revival they were moving on in the
[35:53] promises of God and and they were
[35:56] telling the people we just want to pass
[35:57] through we go into our place we know
[35:59] that we go into our place and for us the
[36:02] blood of Jesus Christ where we are going
[36:05] is to the Millennium amen
[36:09] we are going to the Millennium that's
[36:11] where we are going we going into a
[36:14] rapture onto the millennium and that's
[36:18] what we are going but this principle
[36:22] holds in a way that
[36:25] trust that law will be able to bless us
[36:27] tonight to be able to bring it out so we
[36:30] can see it now listen to Matthew chapter
[36:33] 13 also look a few Scripture than we get
[36:36] into into the world tonight praise the
[36:40] Lord Jesus year in his parable let's
[36:44] read them from verse 10 and the disciple
[36:48] came and said unto Him what speak up
[36:52] down unto them in parables he answered
[36:58] and said unto them because it is giving
[37:02] unto you to know the mystery of the
[37:06] kingdom of heaven but to them it is not
[37:10] giving then wash it now for whatsoever
[37:15] half for whosoever hath to him shall be
[37:21] given and he shall have more abundantly
[37:27] but whatsoever have not from him shall
[37:32] be taken away even that he has this this
[37:39] is a been something they had you know
[37:43] what I was I was I was studying I came
[37:45] from looking at different coming trade
[37:47] it was I mean it was just a lot of
[37:49] presentation out there awright awright
[37:52] Lee couldn't come in light of what I
[37:54] thought brother Branham said about this
[37:56] scripture you know so yeah Jesus laying
[37:59] our principles telling the disciples
[38:02] that he preached in parables because all
[38:09] to them was giving the mystery of the
[38:12] kingdom and then he brings this parable
[38:16] is saying in the world that will help us
[38:19] to understand you know our position year
[38:22] of being dispossessed for whatsoever
[38:27] half to him shall be given and he shall
[38:30] have more abundantly but we also ever
[38:33] have net from him shall be taken away
[38:36] even there he
[38:39] say Luke chapter 18 verse 18 brings it
[38:44] out another way let's look at that then
[38:46] we can be able to it's pretty much the
[38:49] same salut chapter 8
[39:05] in Luke chapter 8 verse 18 let's read
[39:08] from verse 16 less than year jesus said
[39:12] no man when he have light a candle cover
[39:16] it with a vessel or port it under the
[39:20] bed but set it on the candlestick that
[39:24] they wish enter in may see the light for
[39:30] nothing a secret there shall not be made
[39:35] manifest
[39:36] neither anything here that shall not be
[39:39] known and come abroad take heed
[39:43] therefore how ye year for whatsoever
[39:50] half to him shall be given and we so
[39:55] ever have not from him shall he shall be
[40:00] taken even that which he seems to have
[40:04] now Jesus in Matthew chapter 13 he used
[40:10] that in the parable talking about the
[40:12] mysteries of the kingdom but here also
[40:16] in the same light of the scripture it
[40:19] comes even to our personal life life
[40:22] which is a life but Branham says tell
[40:25] how your kind of God lighted now so the
[40:29] principle year is there there when God
[40:34] is dealing with the people that's the
[40:37] group of people they have because it's
[40:40] what he gave when God is dealing wave a
[40:46] people or God is dealing with an
[40:49] individual it's grace unto you
[40:52] whether God is dealing with you in your
[40:55] prayer life or God is open to the word
[40:58] as you are reading the word more easy
[41:01] sometimes and when when the Lord is
[41:04] blessing us with his presence we think
[41:06] that all we are on the housetop you know
[41:08] no but I'm so revving like like it is
[41:10] the grace of God to you now a
[41:14] we don't God that presence if we don't
[41:18] Kindle stick light and he move on to the
[41:24] next group like in the church ages as a
[41:27] revival when he moved on to the next
[41:29] group like in this age and the time that
[41:32] we're living in he's dealing with the
[41:34] bride now so media in the principal as
[41:38] we will look at it with the amma rights
[41:40] he dispossessed he dispossessed the
[41:45] amorite able to bless israel his people
[41:49] in their own lane and the same thing
[41:52] comes over in the church ages and all
[41:56] the blessings that came in a Pentecostal
[41:58] revival god when he moved in the nest
[42:03] age he moved with that blessing over in
[42:06] the bride age like when he left from
[42:09] luther revival he moved with that
[42:12] blessing over to the Wesleyan revival
[42:14] when he moved from the Wesleyan revival
[42:16] he moved with that blessing and then so
[42:19] what happened in in this principle is
[42:22] that the people that are having the
[42:25] revival are the people that God is
[42:27] dealing with and the people that has
[42:29] rejected the revival has been
[42:31] dispossessed so what happened it caused
[42:35] a Connor jealousy it create a kind of
[42:41] jealousy because when brother Branham
[42:44] talks about the iniquity of the ammiraju
[42:47] we also have to notice he placed there
[42:50] to the time of the squeeze because what
[42:56] Pentecostals saw in their revival the
[42:59] the manifestation of the gifts their
[43:02] healing when that time comes and the
[43:05] bride comes to the place were she's
[43:07] manifesting the world they are going to
[43:10] get jealous now let me bring another
[43:14] type of that might help us there in
[43:17] Babylon there was down here in his three
[43:21] friends Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[43:25] when
[43:26] was was made on two down here in the
[43:30] image that was worshipped we realized
[43:33] that there are other Israelites Durham
[43:38] Babylon they felt like Daniel and his
[43:45] friends were proving to be more
[43:48] spiritual they were trying to prove you
[43:51] know what we are here I mean this is not
[43:53] our lane in a way that there is no
[43:56] temple here for us to wash it what is
[43:58] the big thing you know that the trumpet
[44:00] is blown everybody come up we know
[44:01] there's a false god you know but I mean
[44:04] there is no temple here for us to wash
[44:06] it but this young man Danny and his
[44:10] friends they have purpose in their heart
[44:11] that they are not going to bow down to
[44:14] any graven image now so because of the
[44:18] extent there are other Jews got jealous
[44:22] and what it says you think that you know
[44:25] better than us
[44:26] you people think they are traveiing God
[44:28] is so a real in your maze and God is not
[44:32] in our maze now so this is the principle
[44:36] that we might dwell on a little bit as
[44:38] we as we go along I pray that the law
[44:40] will be able to help us as we bring it
[44:43] out together
[44:45] praise the Lord amen
[44:48] let's look in Genesis chapter 4 we spoke
[44:55] from Genesis this gone son is speaking
[44:57] on the mother of all living
[44:59] I got home and I was thinking about it I
[45:02] remember where Paul says in the book of
[45:04] Galatians that we we are from Jerusalem
[45:08] the mother of all and that Jerusalem
[45:11] types the bride because that's how the
[45:13] new city is going to come down the New
[45:16] Jerusalem is coming down like a bride
[45:19] adorned for her husband so so the bride
[45:22] just like we are talking about this the
[45:25] bride opposition that she is now in
[45:28] earth she stands as the mother of all
[45:31] living why because she has the blood
[45:36] it's her presence that is keeping the
[45:39] earth
[45:41] when God takes his church away there
[45:44] will be complete darkness if we think
[45:47] that we have seen the age being that is
[45:49] going to be black but with the presence
[45:53] of the bride on the earth she's the
[45:55] mother of all living because she's
[45:58] holding life on the earth now she's
[46:00] holding the mercy of God on the earth
[46:05] praise the Lord
[46:07] Genesis chapter 4 there's another
[46:11] principal year now you keep that at the
[46:18] back of your mind you know that God this
[46:21] possess the amorite and then he gave the
[46:26] inheritance to his people now you have
[46:29] to know that he is the Lord God of the
[46:32] earth
[46:33] he owns the universe he owns the land
[46:38] and when he gave us a place for us to
[46:42] stand we have to appreciate it if he
[46:46] gave us faith for us to stand for the
[46:49] world we have to appreciate it we don't
[46:51] have to use it to think that we are
[46:53] better than other people on the earth
[46:55] because when God dispossessed you like
[46:57] he did to Nebuchadnezzar's seven years
[47:01] he went like a beasts God gave him you
[47:04] know the the grace to go down there to
[47:07] Babel and capture the people because it
[47:10] was in fulfillment of his word and he
[47:13] thought he did it but when God
[47:15] dispossessed him he was down like a
[47:19] beast so that is the principle that is
[47:25] the principle God used in every age when
[47:28] a lute when a Lutheran revival or the
[47:31] Luther revival came you know what God
[47:34] blessed him but when he was moving
[47:36] because they refused to go all with a
[47:39] move of God God dispossessed him they
[47:42] still with the a denomination and a
[47:47] revived
[47:47] move on and Wesley and his people that
[47:51] web less because now they are having the
[47:54] fire that came over from the first
[47:56] revival it's now here with them
[47:59] the same thing when the Pentecostal
[48:00] revival came doors they saw the
[48:03] Pentecostal revival and when the godly
[48:06] and everything's those that refused to
[48:08] go
[48:09] they were dispossessed because God moves
[48:14] I mean the holy spirit move with the
[48:17] revival and when God dispossessed you
[48:21] you just deal with a form I'm in a
[48:23] message I believe the Prophet which you
[48:26] will just tell with a form but you will
[48:29] not have the life the life is the
[48:31] inheritance the life of the word is our
[48:35] inheritance our inheritance is not a
[48:38] physical land is not a physical
[48:41] inheritance it's a spiritual inheritance
[48:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring
[48:46] us the talking life to give us victory
[48:49] in such a time of discouragement that's
[48:55] our inheritance
[49:04] so let's look here in Genesis chapter 4
[49:13] the scripture says in and Adam knew his
[49:16] wife verse 1 and she conceived and bare
[49:21] King and said I have gotten a man from
[49:26] the Lord he said I receive from the Lord
[49:32] King was the firstborn son of the earth
[49:36] by Nature he was supposed to be the one
[49:41] that inherited earth if we take it honor
[49:44] the lord of the breath right if we take
[49:50] it honor the law of the breath right he
[49:52] was supposed to inherit the earth but
[49:56] what happened when it came down to the
[49:59] time word that will bring Russia
[50:01] and sacrifice to God either got the
[50:05] revelation even move with what what God
[50:08] was doing in that day and King got stuck
[50:12] to his form of religion and God said
[50:16] King do as your brother he refused to
[50:21] move on with God so what happened he was
[50:25] dispossessed go now give him a mag to go
[50:31] as a vagabond in the earth and that
[50:36] place of king of being the one to
[50:41] inherit the earth the firstborn of the
[50:43] earth was now giving to set because what
[50:45] king kill Abel God would have given it
[50:48] to Abel because he got the revelation he
[50:51] was the one I was ready to walk with God
[50:54] because he got the revelation that it
[50:57] was blood he was ready to walk with God
[50:59] because God will only walk with a man
[51:02] that is associated with the blood
[51:06] because with a blood there is no
[51:08] forgiveness of sin God kuna even
[51:12] associate with his parents with our
[51:14] blood God has to provide a blood and
[51:17] life - even associated with his parent
[51:19] so even got that revelation and God was
[51:23] going to move with him God was going to
[51:25] bless him the blessing is now in where
[51:30] our position is in the earth the
[51:32] blessing is in the world the blessing is
[51:36] not in what whatever church wearing
[51:38] whatever church name we gave the
[51:40] blessing is in the promised word of the
[51:43] hour so God dispossessed him and gave
[51:47] the blessing on to said 'who's replace
[51:51] Abel Genesis 425 that's what the
[51:54] scripture says let's look at either and
[51:57] Jacob you will see the same principle of
[52:01] being dispossessed either was the
[52:05] firstborn but because he played down the
[52:08] birthright
[52:13] because he played down the breath right
[52:15] he had no respect on to the breath right
[52:19] so he was dispossessed now even when it
[52:23] came to the time of the blessing Isaac
[52:26] said I have given all to Jacob he said
[52:31] father is there nothing for me as I said
[52:35] I've given all why he was this possess
[52:40] God give the blessing to the man that
[52:43] respected the principle the principle of
[52:45] his word because the principle in that
[52:48] there was the breath right it matters a
[52:52] whole lot
[52:53] God says separate the firstborn he said
[52:57] I saved the firstborn and I save your
[52:59] firstborn in the land of Egypt and slid
[53:02] the first ball of the Egypt and because
[53:04] all the firstborn belongs to me
[53:08] so the principle of the first bomb the
[53:11] principle of the birthright was
[53:13] something that was very important to God
[53:15] no matter how jacob appreciate god bless
[53:19] him because he was more interested in
[53:22] the breath right so is our dispossessed
[53:29] praise the Lord
[53:39] now let's let's read this where BAM says
[53:43] here believe in God the scripture says
[54:01] by one spirit we are baptized into the
[54:05] body
[54:05] oh yeah it looks like I didn't send that
[54:12] to you okay really sorry I won't spirit
[54:21] we are all baptized into one body that's
[54:27] what the scripture says but being
[54:30] baptized into one body we have to
[54:33] realize that you know the Holy Spirit
[54:37] want to you know I mean he want to flow
[54:40] through us he wants who he want to kind
[54:43] of use of last night I was having no I
[54:46] was having a Bible study
[54:50] Wilbur bread last night and and at a
[54:54] church and there's there's something
[54:56] that we were looking at I was very
[54:58] beautiful we were looking at grieve not
[55:04] the Holy Ghost whereby you a seal onto
[55:07] the day of your Redemption and we're
[55:10] paul also say in a book of Thessalonians
[55:14] quench not the spirit
[55:16] here's the beauty that is in the two
[55:19] because there were three things that we
[55:21] were steady Galilee and he spoke to the
[55:23] gallery and he says don't frustrate the
[55:25] grace of God so we were studying on
[55:28] frustrating the grace of God grieving
[55:29] the Holy Spirit and quenching the spirit
[55:31] so we have already there with
[55:34] frustrating the grace of God and so as
[55:37] we were looking at this we were reading
[55:41] and and and that their promise over in a
[55:45] book of efficient is actually says that
[55:48] grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby ye I
[55:51] see
[55:52] on to the day of your Redemption but we
[55:55] will realize here we are still in him
[56:01] when God seal us he seal us in him onto
[56:06] the front until the redemption of our
[56:08] body because Paul says our life is hid
[56:12] in Christ now but when it comes to
[56:17] quenching the spirit it is worth God
[56:21] want to flow through us so what what we
[56:26] were steady naturally I was trying to
[56:28] show him in a scripture is that if we
[56:31] take our security from in Christ and
[56:34] bring our security in the name of a
[56:37] church because I'm in this church
[56:40] because I'm in this system so I'm going
[56:42] to heaven no is because we are in Christ
[56:45] our names are placed on the Lombok of
[56:47] life before the foundation of the world
[56:50] that's where our security is so there
[56:57] are things that God placed in Christ for
[56:59] us and there are things that go want to
[57:02] do through us so it's when we stand in a
[57:09] way of God using us to be be a blessing
[57:13] like we read a discourse your brother
[57:16] Branham says believe in God he says and
[57:18] I know this there are some of us have
[57:21] more faith than others and those who
[57:27] have abundance of faith as supposed to
[57:30] pray for doors but if you don't live the
[57:34] right kind of a life you better leave
[57:38] away from it the devil will laugh at
[57:41] your prayers but when you live right and
[57:47] do right and outright and have faith in
[57:51] God sit on with tremble when you speak
[57:56] he will tremble when you speak cause
[57:59] God's were on the obligation he would
[58:03] take care of that prayer
[58:09] so we can we I mean we we can pray we
[58:13] can i mean shouting and and try to
[58:15] rebuke the devil and everything but if
[58:18] there is something in our life where
[58:22] bellum says the devil would just laugh
[58:24] at your prayer but when their life of
[58:29] Christ is flowing through us and we are
[58:33] being submitted to the word he said God
[58:36] is honor obligation to to take your
[58:39] prayers and move on your behalf so that
[58:46] is the principle year of you know the
[58:53] iniquity of the Amorite because God was
[58:58] bringing his people back told their
[59:02] inheritance in every age go hard and
[59:06] inheritance for the people and that's
[59:10] the reason why when brother Branham
[59:13] spoke in the message that we've been
[59:17] playing there and about the tape the
[59:21] tear pool and the things that were
[59:22] happening that is the bride' inheritance
[59:25] the opening of the word and that word is
[59:28] supposed to expose us to the life of
[59:30] Christ it's supposed to give a faith in
[59:33] the hour of need especially in such a
[59:39] time that we are living in with supposed
[59:41] to have an attitude of faith a very
[59:44] taught of faith
[59:52] Lord birdbrain says something just
[59:57] listing its way when I I got in now
[1:00:07] praise the Lord
[1:00:09] now so we have to watch there because
[1:00:12] just as it was in in in the principal of
[1:00:18] the church ages it's the same thing that
[1:00:20] God he do to the life of the believer
[1:00:26] now let me give you an example in
[1:00:29] brother branham's life verbatim says
[1:00:31] when he when he saw he went to Mishawaka
[1:00:36] and saw the Pentecostal revival he saw
[1:00:39] the move of God there and what God was
[1:00:42] doing him he said he knew that was the
[1:00:46] thing that he's been longing for even
[1:00:49] though when he he saw the vision of
[1:00:51] those two men he could not I mean you
[1:00:54] couldn't understand it but he just knew
[1:00:56] there was something in the mists of
[1:00:57] those people now see what happened when
[1:01:01] brother Branham came back and I mean he
[1:01:05] wanted to take his wife bearing and and
[1:01:07] yeah you know and the mother-in-law
[1:01:10] didn't want him to go there the prophet
[1:01:13] of God says when he listened to dare and
[1:01:14] he never took his wife there
[1:01:16] he said when all of those things
[1:01:19] happened to him
[1:01:21] hope gone his Sharon was gone
[1:01:24] he said it took him almost about six
[1:01:29] months why because God was dealing with
[1:01:35] him God was about to expose him to
[1:01:38] another place of his ministry that's
[1:01:41] what he was called for but because he
[1:01:45] refused to step into death for a wine in
[1:01:49] that period of time the Prophet actually
[1:01:51] actually actually talked about it I mean
[1:01:53] he was still preaching but he did not
[1:01:55] have I mean the vision the way that God
[1:01:58] was dealing with him God was not dealing
[1:02:01] with he said six months went by it was
[1:02:04] almost like
[1:02:06] he was in a desert he was drying because
[1:02:11] we are supposed to move walk in the
[1:02:14] light as it unfold as God open our
[1:02:17] understanding and God is dealing with
[1:02:20] our heart let's step by faith we don't
[1:02:22] have to understand it we have to believe
[1:02:25] that he's in control
[1:02:29] sometimes we try to hold back and and we
[1:02:33] want to understand everything you know
[1:02:38] before we take that step of faith
[1:02:45] we're been said is listening to this in
[1:02:54] the message peffer faith he says now
[1:03:06] faith is based on forgiveness then as we
[1:03:16] said this morning trying to get the
[1:03:18] church into a place to see where we
[1:03:22] could really see apostolic time moving
[1:03:26] among us the time that we are living in
[1:03:30] there it is pretty much the same time
[1:03:33] almost described in the book of Acts
[1:03:35] when the church was on a persecution
[1:03:37] they were moving from house to house
[1:03:39] breaking bread because I mean a God was
[1:03:43] dealing with the imbalances we are
[1:03:45] trying to position ourselves because we
[1:03:49] are longing to see apostolic time moving
[1:03:52] among us he says that's what we are all
[1:03:55] hungry for amen praise the Lord
[1:03:58] I'm telling you since if we will go back
[1:04:01] to that building I just said I mean this
[1:04:03] is I've been praying I said Lord we're
[1:04:06] going to go back oh and formula that
[1:04:08] works you'll never finish it's better
[1:04:11] let us say in our homes what does the
[1:04:17] name
[1:04:17] for God to give us a place for us to
[1:04:19] gather if we are not going to honor his
[1:04:22] name if we are not going to step up and
[1:04:27] embrace what he's doing in this hour if
[1:04:30] we are not going to make ourself
[1:04:32] available and said lawyer I am used me
[1:04:35] for your service I want to be a better
[1:04:39] Christian I want to be a better son of
[1:04:41] God a better daughter of God a better
[1:04:43] husband a better wife if we're now going
[1:04:46] to avail ourselves like that
[1:04:49] then it's better let you stay in our
[1:04:50] homes because the purpose that God
[1:04:57] established the tabernacle right from
[1:04:59] Exeter is for him to come down and dwell
[1:05:03] among us like Paul says where when
[1:05:06] unbelievers come in our mess he was
[1:05:08] saying surely God is among these people
[1:05:11] it is not only for us to read it in the
[1:05:14] Bible it should be happening in our mess
[1:05:18] verbum says we are all that is what we
[1:05:22] are hungry for he says and it just lying
[1:05:28] right at the door we have it at dawn
[1:05:32] with all of these things that the Lord
[1:05:34] has done in this prophet messenger
[1:05:37] ministry that we have read we have a
[1:05:40] right at the door if we would just take
[1:05:42] the right attitude remember the
[1:05:50] scripture there in Matthew because
[1:05:53] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:05:57] will wash comb bring it right into this
[1:06:00] principle when people start tolerating
[1:06:03] things that they should not tolerate God
[1:06:06] dispossessed you he takes that law he
[1:06:09] takes their feminists away from your
[1:06:10] heart because the tenancy with the human
[1:06:14] the human body is there when we get to a
[1:06:16] place of comfort we relax we relax we
[1:06:22] feel so satisfied and that was the
[1:06:25] principle through all the church ages
[1:06:28] when the people recognized the move of
[1:06:30] God
[1:06:31] see all this is hit and then they relax
[1:06:35] and starts to organize and then when God
[1:06:39] starts to move he would not leave his
[1:06:42] glory back here he goes with his glory
[1:06:46] when he left the look that the looter
[1:06:49] revival he went with his glory that was
[1:06:54] the same thing in in in in the book of
[1:06:57] 1st Samuel the glory departed because
[1:07:00] God moved
[1:07:02] he left the old principle of Eli in his
[1:07:06] songs I mean all the other things that
[1:07:09] were doing in the tabernacle the glory
[1:07:11] of God left and when a glory of God left
[1:07:15] what happened Eli's son died LFL of the
[1:07:19] true he broke his neck is just death in
[1:07:22] the organization that's what bourbon
[1:07:24] show through or all the church ages when
[1:07:26] the glory of God moved the people died
[1:07:29] they just see in a form we are Methodist
[1:07:33] we are Baptist we are literally just tea
[1:07:35] in that place where the glory has gone
[1:07:37] because God dispossessed him
[1:07:48] he was going to dis possess the he was
[1:07:54] going to dis possess the the amur eyes
[1:07:57] and gave that blessing to his people so
[1:08:03] what he wanted was for the cup of the
[1:08:08] amorite to be filled and how did it come
[1:08:11] it came to the place word see where Ezra
[1:08:13] said Israel never came fighting against
[1:08:15] him
[1:08:16] it's a please Allah or surpass and
[1:08:18] because they wanted to stop the move of
[1:08:22] God they wanted to stop God people from
[1:08:26] going over just like Paul says not
[1:08:35] discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:08:37] cause many are sick and they're the
[1:08:40] money when we don't discern the lost
[1:08:43] body when we don't discern what God is
[1:08:45] doing in our miss when we don't discern
[1:08:47] what God is doing in our whole life a
[1:08:51] first-rate the grace of God
[1:09:04] principal because it comes up over and
[1:09:07] over over and over even in our own
[1:09:10] individual life we comes to a place and
[1:09:13] God is giving us grace he's giving us
[1:09:15] victory it's so easy for us to relax and
[1:09:18] think that oh yeah now we are we I mean
[1:09:21] now we have the Holy Ghost and now and
[1:09:23] then we realize and as soon as we relax
[1:09:26] we start tolerating things that we
[1:09:30] should not tolerate and then before you
[1:09:33] realize there is no time to pray there
[1:09:38] is no desire for the word because when
[1:09:41] somebody called this scripture you know
[1:09:43] the next verse that follow it so you
[1:09:44] don't have time again to go in the word
[1:09:46] and real estate in the world
[1:10:00] praise the Lord brother branham talks
[1:10:02] about this he says remember Jesus
[1:10:07] reading from peffer faith he said Jesus
[1:10:10] as we hide in a lesson this morning he
[1:10:14] never used his power for himself
[1:10:17] now let me go back here what he's
[1:10:21] talking about
[1:10:22] apostolic time moving among us he says
[1:10:24] that's what we are all hungry for and is
[1:10:27] just lying at the door we see it but we
[1:10:32] want to see more of it we want it such a
[1:10:37] flow that it will that we want a social
[1:10:42] flow that it will be a help to us as
[1:10:47] flow out to others praise Lord we pass
[1:10:58] in the touch you know we are lighting
[1:11:02] one another candid as we go by he says
[1:11:09] remember Jesus never use his power for
[1:11:12] himself
[1:11:12] he used it for others that's what it was
[1:11:16] sent for and that's the reason why I
[1:11:20] says we are not a reservoir for the Holy
[1:11:22] Ghost we are just a China for a to flow
[1:11:26] true God then I gave you the Holy Ghost
[1:11:29] for yourself
[1:11:30] he gave you the whole ego for someone
[1:11:32] that is in need around you
[1:11:45] and you think sometimes while who a man
[1:11:49] that was so full of power like him Jesus
[1:11:53] he says who have ever be sick member
[1:12:01] bentam comes into this year he read the
[1:12:06] scripture what the Bible say he bought
[1:12:09] our infirmities bad means to pack him
[1:12:13] see he bought and he had all things like
[1:12:18] we had he has sickness he had temptation
[1:12:21] he had trouble he had frustration just
[1:12:25] as we have because he had to be the
[1:12:28] right hand of a mediator so he had to
[1:12:32] partake the husband man of the fruit
[1:12:35] before before he will know praise the
[1:12:40] Lord
[1:13:10] to bring this bring this part out here
[1:13:13] in this in this iniquity of the AMA
[1:13:18] rights so we can be able to see it you
[1:13:20] know because as we talked about the
[1:13:24] iniquity of the amorite you really go
[1:13:26] into the study in order all the codes
[1:13:29] out there where Branham talks about the
[1:13:32] time of of the squeeze he talks about
[1:13:37] you know when the union is put together
[1:13:40] you know and and we close our churches
[1:13:43] he says and and why would they do that
[1:13:45] is because we will be standing for the
[1:13:49] life of Jesus Christ on the earth he
[1:13:52] says they will stop us from even praying
[1:13:54] for the sake because we we don't have a
[1:13:59] word council of church membership you
[1:14:01] know so why would they do that because
[1:14:04] they will be thinking there just like in
[1:14:07] the book of Acts
[1:14:08] you know those Pharisees why were they
[1:14:10] raising a man like Paul and autumn man
[1:14:13] to go and stop them from preaching
[1:14:15] why were they doing it because they
[1:14:18] realized that these people were talking
[1:14:21] about a living Christ I mean they were
[1:14:24] raising up a man that sat down at a gate
[1:14:27] of beautiful did everybody that the
[1:14:29] priests and all the people that went to
[1:14:31] that synagogues knew this man from the
[1:14:33] day he was born and they come right
[1:14:36] there to the temple and said silver and
[1:14:37] gold we have not and but what we have we
[1:14:40] give to you in the name of the Lord
[1:14:41] Jesus so pretty soon they were realizing
[1:14:45] we have to stop these people as chapter
[1:14:49] 16 the God right there and a year is
[1:14:52] this man making money out of the
[1:14:54] sickness of this woman and poor comes
[1:14:58] with administrative divine healing he's
[1:15:01] not coming to make money out of the
[1:15:03] sickness of the person he's coming to
[1:15:05] pray for them for them to be here so all
[1:15:12] of those things raise the Sanhedrin
[1:15:15] Council to be that that is that is that
[1:15:17] is in in the form of spiritual jealous
[1:15:20] say that brother Branham says lead to
[1:15:22] slavery
[1:15:23] he said because there were jurors after
[1:15:26] the gift of a Joseph that's what led him
[1:15:31] to slavery but what happened
[1:15:39] God dispossessed him Jesus says to them
[1:15:46] behalf he gave more why because they are
[1:15:51] in the revival they have recognized the
[1:15:53] hour that they are living in they have
[1:15:57] recognized their day in his message he
[1:16:02] gave them more and to them that don't
[1:16:04] have the scripture said he even takes
[1:16:06] what they had so you understand the
[1:16:12] principle is a principle of how God
[1:16:14] worked through the ages because he did
[1:16:17] the same thing in the life of Israel
[1:16:21] because all these nations were trying to
[1:16:24] stop them God move on their behalf
[1:16:27] dispossessed them and give their
[1:16:29] inheritance give their blessing over to
[1:16:32] the children of Israel and so that's the
[1:16:34] same thing the same Holy Ghost that
[1:16:37] brought the Pentecostal revival on Azusa
[1:16:40] Street is the same Holy Ghost we have
[1:16:42] tonight they had just moved in a higher
[1:16:45] form of a relationship with the people
[1:16:48] bringing us to the fullness of the
[1:16:51] inheritance but because the Pentecostal
[1:16:58] revival decided to organize on speaking
[1:17:01] the tongue is the evidence said we are
[1:17:02] satisfied we're going to stay here God
[1:17:05] said okay I would this possess you take
[1:17:07] the blessing and I would give it to the
[1:17:08] endtime bride so you see we're supposed
[1:17:14] to be having gifts in the church because
[1:17:19] all comes with the blessing that he has
[1:17:22] given us
[1:17:30] - perfect interpretation of the word of
[1:17:33] god praise the Lord just like we talk
[1:17:38] about the churches is the same thing
[1:17:42] even in our individual life and in our
[1:17:48] home life we have to observe and watch
[1:17:52] the way that God is dealing with us
[1:17:55] because when you become try and selfish
[1:17:58] with the gift of God he would dis
[1:18:00] possess you and he would go a season dry
[1:18:06] God want for you to be happy glorified
[1:18:11] testifying about what he's doing in your
[1:18:13] life and III mean that now being shot is
[1:18:18] it's not your own making this now your
[1:18:19] own it's now your own life it's what God
[1:18:22] is doing in your life testified about
[1:18:24] his goodness we cannot say that all this
[1:18:29] time I mean we've been home from one
[1:18:32] another God has not been doing things in
[1:18:34] our life and we would come to service
[1:18:36] that was not even and not of things
[1:18:38] someone would not even send a text
[1:18:40] message and said all brother Scott
[1:18:41] praise the Lord the Lord was good to me
[1:18:43] and I was not feeling well what is
[1:18:46] happening what do we want to see God
[1:18:48] doing he's already doing what he's
[1:18:50] supposed to do he's keeping us in good
[1:18:52] health he's blessing us with his
[1:18:56] presence and we must take the attitude
[1:18:59] to testify of his goodness because if
[1:19:03] net he dispossessed you you go over dry
[1:19:05] you go through a dry season we all have
[1:19:08] been there our baby I have been there I
[1:19:15] mean there are times you just read you
[1:19:18] read a message you stay there I mean you
[1:19:19] stare and you stare that you study and
[1:19:21] you're waiting on God to just come down
[1:19:23] and bless the table that is on your
[1:19:25] heart so you can be a blessing to the
[1:19:28] people and you just dry and you know
[1:19:31] what dryness dot it for straights so
[1:19:33] when you see the preacher just
[1:19:35] frustrating he's shouting other people
[1:19:37] all over the place sometimes it's
[1:19:38] because of that
[1:19:42] praise the Lord what you see is a
[1:19:45] beautiful principle because the Lord
[1:19:50] wants whatever he gave to us we give it
[1:19:52] out he took the five love of bread now
[1:19:57] little boy launched he lifted up he
[1:19:59] bless him and he breaks he gave it to
[1:20:02] the disciple the handed-down and the
[1:20:03] more they were hindering it down the
[1:20:05] quicker they were giving it
[1:20:06] Jesus was putting it in their hands and
[1:20:08] five love of bread was able to feed
[1:20:10] 5,000 people because if they were
[1:20:16] figuring out in the our mind
[1:20:18] oh this one I get this person but there
[1:20:20] will not be enough no Jesus limit on he
[1:20:23] breaks it he gave it to the disciples
[1:20:24] were just supposed to give it along give
[1:20:26] it they were just supposed to give it
[1:20:28] along the Bible says five times the main
[1:20:31] was about a women and the children and
[1:20:36] then they were also tore basket talk to
[1:20:40] her basket loss they were remaining or
[1:20:43] to a basket it took her from the remnant
[1:20:46] that were on the ground why because the
[1:20:49] disciples were just giving it out and
[1:20:50] that's how we supposed to be that's how
[1:20:54] we supposed to be oh praise the Lord you
[1:20:56] know what I read in the Word of God
[1:20:58] today of who it was just so beautiful
[1:20:59] that scripture I read this morning was
[1:21:01] just wonderful
[1:21:02] all of those things the Bell faith when
[1:21:08] we can talk about the little things that
[1:21:10] he's doing in our life the little light
[1:21:13] he's opening to our eyes there is no way
[1:21:17] we're going to fall a step into this /
[1:21:20] FF faith if we don't take the attitude
[1:21:22] now like brother Branham says faith is
[1:21:25] based on forgiveness that is the
[1:21:29] foundation and he's saying this in a
[1:21:32] message perfect faith now faith is based
[1:21:34] on forgiveness that is the very
[1:21:39] foundation because you read the
[1:21:41] scripture if you don't forgive your
[1:21:42] heavenly Father will not forgive you he
[1:21:44] won't forgive your trespasses how are we
[1:21:49] going to
[1:21:49] have this attitude for a faith to change
[1:21:52] our body afraid to be able to step into
[1:21:57] a rapture afraid to walk with God in
[1:22:01] such a time
[1:22:05] there's no time to hold any bitterness
[1:22:07] in any indifference in our hearts we
[1:22:11] must be able to pour it out before the
[1:22:13] Lord click on that positive attitude
[1:22:22] because we have to realize that
[1:22:26] expectation like I've said over and over
[1:22:29] is the bearing ground for the
[1:22:31] supernatural when we are expecting God
[1:22:33] then he comes on the scene whenever you
[1:22:39] are expecting him you provoke him to
[1:22:42] move transloading and when you are
[1:22:47] expecting someone you know you made you
[1:22:48] made the room clean you face all the
[1:22:50] cheese you clean the plate because you
[1:22:52] are expecting and that's the kind of
[1:22:54] attitude that we need to have that's the
[1:23:01] reason why there are many people around
[1:23:03] it says well the thing we saw in brother
[1:23:05] branham message we can see it all I mean
[1:23:07] I mean people just asking question that
[1:23:10] I just asked a question is because you
[1:23:13] know we came to a place where we got so
[1:23:15] relaxed
[1:23:16] we took a tight and put it on our chest
[1:23:18] we are the bride and we were not doing
[1:23:21] the thing that the bride's supposed to
[1:23:22] do
[1:23:31] doing the thing that the bride supposed
[1:23:32] to do brother Albert Brennaman since
[1:23:35] when when when Rebecca realized when she
[1:23:38] realized the Elysa was a stranger she
[1:23:48] went out there get to the well he had
[1:23:53] never told her anything just thinking in
[1:23:56] his mind he just got from his knees and
[1:23:58] said Lord the woman that would come out
[1:24:00] here and give me water and give my
[1:24:02] canvas water to drink that was a mature
[1:24:09] woman because she had some muscles to be
[1:24:11] able to pull water and feed those
[1:24:13] cameras that drink a lot like that I
[1:24:15] mean it's just our attitude he want us
[1:24:19] working you know he want us working if
[1:24:23] we're not talking to someone let's be
[1:24:24] praying for somebody nate I'm a net you
[1:24:35] know trying to to throw down what God is
[1:24:37] doing let's build up our most holy faith
[1:24:42] like Paul says because we are in such a
[1:24:46] time we have we are approaching our
[1:24:49] inheritance he dispossessed came because
[1:24:58] he rejected he rejected the Word of God
[1:25:00] he rejected the revelation of the hour
[1:25:03] it was blood that was a revelation and
[1:25:07] God told him go back because he rejected
[1:25:10] God dispossessing he became a vagabond
[1:25:14] something that should have been his
[1:25:16] inheritance because he was the first son
[1:25:18] of the earth God dispossessed either
[1:25:25] because he downplayed the birthright you
[1:25:29] downplayed the birthright but you want
[1:25:31] the blessing you don't want the Holy
[1:25:32] Ghost but you want joy is the Holy Ghost
[1:25:35] that brings joy you don't want the Holy
[1:25:39] Ghost but you want happiness is the Holy
[1:25:41] Ghost that brings happiness is the Holy
[1:25:43] Ghost that bring peace
[1:25:45] is the holy ghost that brings healing
[1:25:47] and you can play down the holy ghost and
[1:25:50] then get the blessing I hope who you you
[1:26:03] were able to follow me tonight and grab
[1:26:05] that principle God did it in the church
[1:26:08] ages I mean he also do it in the life of
[1:26:12] the believers if we don't pay attention
[1:26:16] to what he's doing he moved on praise
[1:26:21] the Lord if God you see that in a
[1:26:25] community of believers you were here oh
[1:26:28] I had that burden you know if God
[1:26:31] putting the burden on your heart and you
[1:26:33] are so busy to do that he will move on
[1:26:35] and give another person the burden he
[1:26:41] will put the burden on another person
[1:26:42] his heart and that person will come up
[1:26:44] in and start testifying all whoa you
[1:26:47] know the Lord gave me the burden to do
[1:26:48] this or the burden to pray for this
[1:26:50] person he said oh yeah I had that birdie
[1:26:52] oh yeah you know you had the burden but
[1:26:57] you did nothing about it we have to
[1:27:03] realize in the principle there and in
[1:27:06] Genesis chapter one every day there was
[1:27:10] something for the Lord God to do and it
[1:27:13] was good in his eyes so every day there
[1:27:16] was something that a Lord girl want to
[1:27:18] do in our lives in our home in our
[1:27:21] assembling and he's looking for men and
[1:27:27] women that are making himself available
[1:27:30] people that our honor expectation let's
[1:27:35] go to the Lord in prayer this evening
[1:27:57] no matter how with all the restriction
[1:28:02] even if they lock us in our homes and
[1:28:04] say we shouldn't go out if the Lord God
[1:28:07] wants something to do he put that burden
[1:28:09] on your heart he would give you an
[1:28:11] instruction on how to do it crashes the
[1:28:21] measure of glory Weber Bram says he want
[1:28:25] to unfold himself to us he want to deal
[1:28:28] with our hearts he said we get so busy
[1:28:29] we we you know we allowed you know
[1:28:34] whatever different things he call he
[1:28:36] talks about family life he talks about
[1:28:38] our work life he talks about different
[1:28:40] things when God want to really reveal
[1:28:46] himself for us to the place where he can
[1:28:48] be able
[1:29:00] fill my cup slow let's just sing there
[1:29:03] tonight
[1:29:14] I leave a comment with the testing of my
[1:29:33] soul
[1:29:38] read off
[1:29:43] me know yes Michael
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:30:04] yeah yes my
[1:30:11] I live it up
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:18] come back with space-tastic all by soul
[1:30:30] red
[1:30:32] [Music]
[1:30:45] yes like um
[1:30:51] and make me think about Niemeyer's now
[1:30:59] if our hair is bad God was dealing with
[1:31:02] Lee Myers hot for the building of the
[1:31:06] temple the building of the walls of
[1:31:08] Jerusalem God was dealing with his heart
[1:31:12] he never said this to anybody but the
[1:31:20] expression on his face the humbleness on
[1:31:26] his face the quietness of his spirit
[1:31:29] even the king who realize that no God is
[1:31:37] dealing with this man he didn't know
[1:31:41] what it is he didn't know but he just
[1:31:44] knew there was something there was
[1:31:47] something because Niemeyer's was not in
[1:31:53] all the conspiracy theory there and what
[1:31:55] is happening in Jerusalem I guess there
[1:31:57] was conspiracy theory in those days he
[1:31:59] was not into all the news in all the
[1:32:02] argument there was a burden on his heart
[1:32:04] for the rebuilding of the wall and that
[1:32:07] burden was making him humble before the
[1:32:10] Lord humble when God is dealing with a
[1:32:14] man's life the prophet of God said
[1:32:16] that's what I would do it will make you
[1:32:18] humble
[1:32:22] regardless dealing with you and you can
[1:32:25] see it and you can recognize it it will
[1:32:29] make you humbled you will not walk out I
[1:32:37] said know it all you be very careful
[1:32:40] you'll be very prayerful you will walk
[1:32:45] humbly before the Lord
[1:32:52] where Baron says that promise is right
[1:32:55] before the door we can have an apostolic
[1:33:00] fake breaking us on on us in this hour
[1:33:09] with everything that is going on it's
[1:33:12] not going to take praying for the sake
[1:33:14] away from the church because the
[1:33:16] scripture says we will pray for the sake
[1:33:19] and they shall be healed
[1:33:27] [Music]
[1:33:33] there was a gentleman we were praying
[1:33:35] for this morning it was a co-worker to
[1:33:40] sister Colson steered in hospital and
[1:33:46] the doctors just called the wife to go
[1:33:49] and see him over at a Regional Hospital
[1:33:51] and the real call him for her to go and
[1:33:54] say goodbye to her husband we pray this
[1:33:58] morning and we've been remembering him
[1:34:01] in prayer and we just believe that God
[1:34:05] God have now finished with him God can
[1:34:09] turn the plate around
[1:34:11] that's the hour that we are living in
[1:34:14] that is the hour that we are living in
[1:34:17] where Benham says even if we pray for 10
[1:34:21] person and they all die during this time
[1:34:23] it's not it's going to build our faith
[1:34:25] more it's not going to weaken our faith
[1:34:29] is going to bring us more closer to God
[1:34:31] but we need to rise up to that faith is
[1:34:35] not a mental work of it's an attitude
[1:34:38] that is affecting our life we are
[1:34:41] keeping ourselves humble before God we
[1:34:43] are watching what God is doing
[1:34:45] it is not honest and a mentor a sight
[1:34:49] man it is not just an emotional work of
[1:34:52] it is the thing that is affecting our
[1:34:54] life it is where God is bringing us
[1:34:59] in this time and then in a new order
[1:35:03] that is coming upon a word and and I
[1:35:05] mean in a nude approach and all of these
[1:35:07] things that is happening know God want
[1:35:09] to affect our life he's bringing us to
[1:35:12] our place he's bringing us to our hour
[1:35:24] oh I'm telling you to be living in such
[1:35:27] a time with our or in our Lyme is
[1:35:30] frustrating to be living in such a time
[1:35:33] where you can I get a nod from the Holy
[1:35:35] Spirit where you cannot get an
[1:35:37] inspiration from God where you can I get
[1:35:40] a burden to pray it is frustrating
[1:35:43] because there is no church life church
[1:35:48] life used to be a covering where we can
[1:35:50] get together and sing we can rub arms
[1:35:53] with one another and that we can listen
[1:35:55] to the choir singing we don't have that
[1:35:57] so if we can I get a nudge from God if
[1:36:00] we cannot get an inspiration of the Holy
[1:36:03] Spirit upon our heart if we can I get a
[1:36:05] burden to pray for somebody just a
[1:36:07] burden to stay before God and just weed
[1:36:10] and say Lord yeah and be with my
[1:36:12] brothers and sisters just like we're
[1:36:15] Brenham share we read here he says I
[1:36:21] know this that some of us has more faith
[1:36:24] than others and those that have a
[1:36:26] bonding of faith are supposed to pray
[1:36:29] for those that don't have that's what
[1:36:32] the tear poo is for actually brother
[1:36:34] branham shade is for the weak ones it's
[1:36:36] for the ones that can grab it there's a
[1:36:43] people that God is raising up in this
[1:36:46] hour just like Esther to stand in a gap
[1:36:52] we are just like Hannah we are seeing
[1:36:56] the the filling of the church system we
[1:36:59] want God to raise up a ministry we want
[1:37:02] to move of God and when little Samuel
[1:37:05] came on the scene the glory of God
[1:37:08] departed God dispossessed Eli and give
[1:37:11] that blessing to Samir
[1:37:29] father
[1:37:31] lived in our life to you tonight we want
[1:37:35] more of you we want more of you Father
[1:37:40] dear Lord
[1:37:46] we want more of your grace in our life
[1:37:53] father if the bride stains as the mother
[1:37:56] of all living if we are the one that has
[1:38:00] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:38:05] if we are the one that is controlling
[1:38:07] like the moon control the tides of the
[1:38:11] sea wishes the type of judgment it holds
[1:38:14] back the tsunami it holds back the water
[1:38:17] from running over the lane and that's
[1:38:20] where the bride's things our position is
[1:38:22] to hold the wrath of God until that last
[1:38:25] Gillett comes in our position is to hold
[1:38:28] back the wrath of God until our loved
[1:38:30] ones I said if that is the place that we
[1:38:32] are in the place that you have caused us
[1:38:35] to be the father we put ourselves before
[1:38:39] you tonight and say Lord may you help us
[1:38:41] O God may you help us Oh father grab our
[1:38:48] focus
[1:38:50] in the right place brother branham in
[1:38:53] the preview of the bride
[1:38:55] he said she was walking she started
[1:38:59] stepping out of line because her focus
[1:39:01] she was looking at that other group and
[1:39:07] we are looking in the wrong places we
[1:39:11] are looking in the wrong places let's
[1:39:16] live for our heads our Redemption Drori
[1:39:21] night
[1:39:23] let's lift our hands up onto the hills
[1:39:26] from welcoming our help
[1:39:31] if there is ever a time where we need to
[1:39:34] trust God now mentally but just trust
[1:39:38] him trusting whatever you are dealing
[1:39:42] with you need to trust God we need to
[1:39:48] get ahold of him just like Jacob day
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:55] he had a brief ride he had a blessing oh
[1:39:58] but there was something more he needed
[1:40:01] he needed a God of the blessing to
[1:40:04] become rear to him his father Isaac has
[1:40:10] bless him he went over god bless his
[1:40:13] hand God prosper him in the land that
[1:40:15] there with his father-in-law but he
[1:40:19] needed a god that has keen on he needed
[1:40:22] a god that was so real because he was
[1:40:26] growing now back to his inheritance and
[1:40:30] father that's the place where we are we
[1:40:34] have read these things Lord we have
