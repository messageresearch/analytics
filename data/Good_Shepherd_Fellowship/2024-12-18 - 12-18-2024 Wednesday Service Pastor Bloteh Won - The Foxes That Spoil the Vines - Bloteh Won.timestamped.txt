[45:52] amen the Lord bless you thank you thank
[45:55] you thank you musicians
[45:57] let's take our Bible tonight and and we
[46:00] will just go to the sons of Solomon sons
[46:03] of Solomon Chapter
[46:05] 2 I want to I want to speak on the
[46:07] prophecy
[46:10] tonight never seen that as a prophet
[46:13] said
[46:14] until uh uh few days
[46:18] ago I was listening to a tape I was
[46:20] actually listening to the message the
[46:22] Rapture and brother Bram says something
[46:24] and then uh uh
[46:27] uh the Lord the Holy Spirit kind of
[46:31] brought something to my mind so I
[46:33] stopped the tap and then I started
[46:34] looking at some few things and I
[46:36] realized there was a prophecy that was
[46:38] laying down right in this chapter we
[46:41] want to read tonight so let's just uh
[46:44] take Psalms of Solomon Chapter 2 and we
[46:48] read from verse 8 like I said I'm trying
[46:50] to lay a foundation for what I want to
[46:52] speak on Sunday and going on Amen
[46:55] because you know when I start like this
[46:57] is hard to get get out of Faith but
[46:59] let's uh read from verse two the voice
[47:03] of my beloved praise the Lord the voice
[47:06] of my beloved and what I want us to
[47:08] realize in this in this writing that
[47:12] Solomon wrote The Beloved is
[47:15] Christ amen the Beloved is Christ so we
[47:20] we have to keep that now so the voice of
[47:22] my
[47:23] beloved behold he cometh leaping upon
[47:27] the mountain skipping upon the hill my
[47:31] beloved is like a road all a young heart
[47:35] behold he standed behind our wall he
[47:39] lookth forth at the uh at the window
[47:43] showing himself through the lashes my
[47:46] beloved speak and said unto me rise up
[47:50] my love my fair one and come away praise
[47:54] the Lord this looks like like h h a kind
[47:58] of beautiful sen year of the bride and
[48:02] the bridegroom my belov speak and said
[48:06] unto me rise up my love my fed one come
[48:10] away for L the winter is passed no
[48:13] winter is here for us amen it have not
[48:16] passed yet praise the Lord the rain is
[48:19] over and
[48:21] gone the flower appeared on Earth it
[48:24] looks like
[48:25] springtime the time the time of the
[48:28] singing of birds is come and the voice
[48:32] of the turtles is heard in our will
[48:35] learn the fake tree pth forth her green
[48:39] fate and the vines have their tender
[48:44] grapes gave a good smell Arise My
[48:48] Love My Fair one come
[48:53] away oh my do thou are in the Cliff of
[48:58] the Rock in the secret place of the
[49:01] stirs now look here that you have to
[49:04] remember uh uh the secret place here
[49:07] brother brandham in Psalm chapter 27
[49:10] brother brandham read that same thing
[49:12] about the secret place hiding in the
[49:14] secret place and that was what he also
[49:17] used as a type of the Rapture so you see
[49:20] the bridegroom is calling the bride away
[49:24] in springtime and we know Springtime
[49:26] speak speak about Resurrection praise
[49:28] the Lord so there there there is a lot
[49:31] of thing that is playing out here more
[49:34] than what we can see we have to remember
[49:36] that every the prophet of God says when
[49:38] you read the Bible if you don't see
[49:41] Christ go back and read it again amen
[49:45] and what we have to realize is that uh
[49:48] uh uh every word of every word that is
[49:51] written in this Bible is a
[49:53] prophecy praise the Lord the Holy Spirit
[49:56] just have to pick it up open our eyes
[49:59] and make us to realize that it's a
[50:01] prophecy because it's God's Own word
[50:04] amen so I read that again verse 14 oh my
[50:07] Dove thou in the Cliff of the rock which
[50:10] is hiding in Revelation in the secret
[50:13] place of the stirs let me see th
[50:16] countenance let me hear thy
[50:19] voice for sweet is th voice and their
[50:23] countenance is coming
[50:26] but this is where we want to
[50:28] dwell take us the
[50:32] foxes take us the
[50:37] foxes for the most time that this
[50:40] scripture has been
[50:43] read they have always sound like take up
[50:47] the foxes for the little foxes spoil the
[50:51] vine but we want to look at it a little
[50:53] different or a little close or maybe a a
[50:56] little deeper tonight take us the foxes
[51:00] the little foxes that spoil the vine for
[51:04] our Vine have tender
[51:07] Grace St John chapter
[51:11] 15 St John chapter
[51:18] 15 praise the
[51:21] Lord St John chapter 15
[51:31] St John chapter
[51:33] 15 verse
[51:37] one I am the True
[51:40] Vine and my H and my father is the
[51:44] husband man let's pray
[51:48] father we just want to give your word to
[51:50] you tonight come Lord father and just
[51:54] bless these few thoughts that is on our
[51:56] pass tonight as we want to look closely
[51:58] into the word let something be said that
[52:02] will draw us closer to you let something
[52:04] be said Lord that will open our eyes to
[52:08] the time that we are living in and the
[52:10] things that are happening around us in
[52:12] Jesus name we pray amen
[52:16] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[52:19] your
[52:22] seat like I said I was I was listening
[52:25] to to the message the Rapture and
[52:28] actually this is the statement that
[52:30] brother Brandon made and and it caught
[52:32] my mind in the Rapture message the
[52:34] prophet of God said the Lord
[52:38] himself had a sense of human you know he
[52:41] said
[52:43] Herold go tell thy
[52:46] Fox
[52:48] see
[52:49] today I cast out devil tomorrow I'm made
[52:54] perfect so he had a sense of him
[52:58] well it won't hurt us I don't think so
[53:01] once in a while praise the Lord so he
[53:04] said that you know he said when Jesus
[53:08] said referring to pharaoh go tell that
[53:11] fox brother bam said Jesus was was
[53:14] making fun or just making a little joke
[53:18] but then there is another place also
[53:21] where he said it and and he said it in a
[53:23] different way we're going to look at
[53:25] that tonight
[53:27] so it caught my
[53:28] mind that Jesus re referred to Pharaoh I
[53:33] mean Herod sorry Herod as a
[53:38] fox and here is on
[53:42] inspiration Solomon is
[53:45] now speaking about the bridegroom and
[53:48] the
[53:49] bride and he's talking about how the
[53:52] foxes pour the
[53:54] vine praise the Lord
[53:57] amen and Jesus came and he says I am the
[54:01] True
[54:02] Vine amen if he identified Herod to be a
[54:07] fox and he identified himself to be a
[54:11] Vine then we have to pay attention there
[54:14] is something more than just a
[54:17] joke praise the Lord there is something
[54:21] more than just a sense of humor that I
[54:23] want for us to pay attention to tonight
[54:26] praise the Lord because the same foxes
[54:30] that SPO the vine that time is also
[54:33] sporing the vine
[54:35] now praise the
[54:38] lord we have lot of foxes that have come
[54:41] into the
[54:42] vanard and they are destroying the vine
[54:46] they are destroying the vine before a
[54:48] put out is T of
[54:51] grapes and that's what I want for us to
[54:53] pay attention to tonight I want for us
[54:56] to look closely into the scripture
[54:59] because you will realize just before our
[55:02] lord Jesus will be born it was
[55:07] Herold that was a
[55:10] governor and he will be the one that
[55:12] will ask that every child from two years
[55:15] old should be killed because he heard a
[55:19] wise man saying where is he born King of
[55:21] the
[55:22] Jews so right from that time the foxes
[55:27] was destroying the
[55:31] vine and so I want us to pay
[55:36] attention
[55:38] because this Bible this word of God that
[55:41] we we hold before us tonight is
[55:44] interal praise the Lord amen we can
[55:49] preach from Genesis to Revelation and we
[55:52] will not come close to understanding The
[55:54] Depths that is in this word
[55:57] praise the Lord let me tell you one
[55:59] thing that is
[56:00] true all
[56:04] eternity this is what we will be
[56:08] understanding all
[56:11] inity there is more in
[56:14] you that we will understand in
[56:19] eternity praise the
[56:21] Lord
[56:23] amen but let's look at this very closely
[56:25] because I want to bring it down to
[56:28] something that is that is uh you know
[56:30] that is happening in our time and and
[56:32] happening in our range that we call the
[56:35] message of the
[56:38] hour so brother Bram said there he says
[56:41] you know what Jesus have a sense of
[56:43] human he called the uh uh Herold go tell
[56:47] th
[56:48] Fox but we want to look at a more than a
[56:51] sense of
[56:52] humor praise the Lord because you have
[56:55] to remember
[56:57] when Jesus was identified on the River
[57:02] Jordan and two of John disciples follow
[57:06] him I believe there were many many many
[57:09] other animals but Jesus said the foxes
[57:13] have
[57:15] hes the birds have Nets but the son of
[57:19] man don't have a place to lay his
[57:23] head why he Call Foxes why he never talk
[57:27] about the Lions why he never talk about
[57:29] the goats that were on the
[57:32] mountain I want us to pay attention
[57:37] tonight praise the
[57:41] Lord
[57:51] amen listen to what brother Brandon will
[57:54] say as we as we build this t talk
[57:56] tonight and go ahead in the message
[57:59] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[58:01] and forever he says now in he says in
[58:05] the days of the
[58:07] scripture he didn't take upon himself
[58:10] any great name talking about our lord
[58:13] Jesus he was a man that was humble but
[58:17] yet a man that could tell you if it was
[58:23] necessary you know what he told Herod
[58:27] you know what he told the Pharisees he
[58:31] ploted those ropes together he beat them
[58:34] out of the temple and called them
[58:36] hypocrite snake in the grass and
[58:39] everything
[58:40] else and call Herod and old
[58:45] Fox but yet for of humanity humble man
[58:50] and he went about doing good to
[58:54] everybody that he could now so brother
[58:57] brandham is also bringing another
[58:59] picture after he he make us to see like
[59:02] you know Jesus was just saying a little
[59:04] sense of heing but now he's bringing it
[59:06] in another
[59:08] way that Jesus did not bite his tongue
[59:11] when he
[59:12] spoke amen he didn't bite his tongue he
[59:17] said things the way it was he called the
[59:19] Pharisees you know that you were
[59:23] just a white wash on the home he's a
[59:27] snake in the grass you know he called
[59:29] them and yeah he referring to this very
[59:31] same statement he said he called Herold
[59:34] which was the governor a
[59:38] fox praise the Lord
[59:41] amen now for you to be able to get the
[59:46] picture of what we want to go in
[59:49] tonight you see it's just like when you
[59:52] read back in the Old Testament and you
[59:55] hear about pharaoh
[59:56] phoh
[59:58] Pharaoh is not uh a name Pharaoh is a
[1:00:04] title amen so also Hera is a
[1:00:11] title because if you don't pay attention
[1:00:15] you will you will
[1:00:17] miss things that are in the
[1:00:20] scripture you you could read about many
[1:00:24] Heros and you think that is just one
[1:00:30] Herold and that's what I want for us to
[1:00:33] pay attention
[1:00:34] tonight because Herod the Great that was
[1:00:38] the
[1:00:39] governor of Juda at the time that Jesus
[1:00:42] was
[1:00:44] born was not the same Herod that
[1:00:47] requested John the Baptist
[1:00:50] head he was not the same hero that
[1:00:54] killed James in the book of
[1:00:57] arch praise the
[1:01:01] Lord are we
[1:01:04] together but if uh if if if if if
[1:01:09] Herod that that uh uh that requested for
[1:01:13] all the children from two years old to
[1:01:16] be killed at a
[1:01:21] time if he's not the same one
[1:01:29] that requested the head of John the
[1:01:31] Baptist if he will be
[1:01:34] different and the one that will that
[1:01:37] will that will kill James in Acts
[1:01:39] chapter 12 will be different and Jesus
[1:01:45] will call this Herald a fox then there
[1:01:48] is something about the fox that spoil
[1:01:51] the
[1:01:53] vine there is something that Jesus was
[1:01:58] identifying that I want us to pay
[1:02:01] attention
[1:02:03] to praise the Lord no doubt brother
[1:02:07] Brandon in in in in some other messages
[1:02:09] he used the foxes that SP the vine as
[1:02:13] our little misbehavior you know he says
[1:02:15] our our besetting sins you know get rid
[1:02:18] of those besetting sin those little
[1:02:20] little things you know it's not the big
[1:02:22] things it's the little things as he said
[1:02:24] that he identified them all also as
[1:02:26] foxes but I'm I'm I'm looking more into
[1:02:29] prophecy
[1:02:30] tonight amen I'm looking more into
[1:02:35] prophecy
[1:02:37] tonight then uh uh
[1:02:44] uh so that's what I want for us to look
[1:02:46] at a little bit let's let's go into into
[1:02:50] a little history
[1:02:54] here you realize realiz that uh uh uh
[1:02:59] Herod the
[1:03:01] Great historian identified that uh he
[1:03:05] was around
[1:03:06] 37 uh to
[1:03:09] to to 4
[1:03:11] BC and and they said it was just in that
[1:03:14] time that Jesus was
[1:03:16] born so when you read in the scripture
[1:03:20] and it talks about the the the heral
[1:03:22] that that the wise men met praise the
[1:03:25] Lord
[1:03:27] he will be that very same
[1:03:29] Herald he will be the one that uh the
[1:03:32] wise men will meet and and then he will
[1:03:35] be the one also to uh uh uh tell them
[1:03:41] when you find the child you know come
[1:03:42] and tell me and I would like to go and
[1:03:44] worship the child and and that's that's
[1:03:47] all the Christmas story amen the birth
[1:03:50] of
[1:03:51] Jesus and the wise man would not tell
[1:03:53] him the Bible says that uh the Lord will
[1:03:56] lead them another way to go away and and
[1:03:59] then present their gifts and and they
[1:04:01] got away but yet when he realized that
[1:04:04] he never saw the wise man he commanded
[1:04:07] that you know children from two years
[1:04:09] old uh should be
[1:04:13] killed praise the
[1:04:16] Lord then if you look closely
[1:04:20] also uh the Bible will speak of uh uh
[1:04:28] this will be in uh in uh uh uh Matthew
[1:04:32] Chapter
[1:04:34] 2 the Bible will speak of why uh
[1:04:40] uh Mary and Joseph could not stay in
[1:04:43] Beed him because there was uh arula wish
[1:04:49] of call he was the
[1:04:53] son of the of the Herold the great
[1:04:56] Herold that wanted the children to be
[1:05:01] killed so because of him because of his
[1:05:04] son Mary and Joseph will leave
[1:05:07] Bethlehem and it will go down to
[1:05:11] Nazareth praise the
[1:05:21] Lord then the Bible will speak about uh
[1:05:29] Herold
[1:05:32] Antipas he's the
[1:05:35] one that will kill John the
[1:05:39] Baptist but before we we get into death
[1:05:43] I want us to pay attention
[1:05:46] also you read St John Chapter
[1:05:50] 2 Jesus said destroy this Temple and he
[1:05:55] three days I will raise it up the Bible
[1:05:58] says the Jews thought that it was the
[1:06:01] temple that Herod
[1:06:05] build praise the Lord so the temple that
[1:06:09] the sedran council was using that Temple
[1:06:13] was built by Herod the
[1:06:18] Great now if you want to trace this
[1:06:20] whole thing back and get a good picture
[1:06:23] of it you will realize that
[1:06:27] hero you see Rome Rome was ruling the
[1:06:31] word at that
[1:06:34] time they were ruling the word and and
[1:06:37] in in different parts in different
[1:06:40] regions they put men up to be
[1:06:44] Governor now Herod was put
[1:06:47] over Jerusalem to be a governor because
[1:06:52] the Romans thought that he was a Jew
[1:06:58] praise the
[1:07:01] Lord because what the Romans would do is
[1:07:04] that they would choose a man of this
[1:07:07] tribe to to govern his people and that
[1:07:11] man will send report over to uh uh uh
[1:07:15] you know the the
[1:07:18] the whoever the Roman Governor that was
[1:07:21] ruling at the time you know well so
[1:07:24] that's the reason why when you see see
[1:07:26] at the death of Jesus he was sent to
[1:07:29] Herod and Herod sent him back to Pilot
[1:07:32] pilot was the Roman
[1:07:35] Governor Herod was the Jewish Governor
[1:07:40] working for Rome are we together are you
[1:07:44] seeing the picture praise the Lord
[1:07:48] amen now so but what is happening here
[1:07:52] is that Herod was not
[1:07:59] Jew he was not a
[1:08:03] Jew
[1:08:07] herrow historian shows that herrow was
[1:08:10] from Edom he was an
[1:08:14] Edomite and Edom will go back to
[1:08:21] Esau are we
[1:08:23] together amen
[1:08:26] and there was a
[1:08:28] conflict right from the
[1:08:31] womb between Esau and
[1:08:37] Jacob and that
[1:08:39] conflict will take us in the
[1:08:48] Rapture praise the
[1:08:50] Lord that
[1:08:54] conflict that that conflict will put a
[1:08:56] pressure on this
[1:09:01] bride because remember they were
[1:09:04] twins in the
[1:09:10] womb praise the
[1:09:13] Lord so when Jesus called Herod the fox

[1:09:25] when Solomon said is the foxes that
[1:09:28] spoil the
[1:09:30] vine he might he might not have known
[1:09:34] what he was saying but it was a
[1:09:38] prophecy praise the Lord because right
[1:09:41] from the birth of Christ the fox was
[1:09:44] already there to start eating of the
[1:09:48] vine trying to get the vine he killed
[1:09:52] children from two years old on
[1:10:00] praise the

[1:11:17] James the brother of John with a
[1:11:20] SW now he was coming afterward
[1:11:25] he was vexing
[1:11:27] what he was vexing the
[1:11:32] church the Bible says he was vexing the
[1:11:35] church he was putting pressure on the
[1:11:44] church are we together but you see
[1:11:48] because the the Roman Governor

[1:12:59] word he never said a word to
[1:13:03] him praise the
[1:13:05] Lord
[1:13:07] amen and there's a reason why he never
[1:13:10] said a word to

[1:15:19] right upon it the spoken word The Living
[1:15:20] Word Tabernacle
[1:15:27] you have to realize that the vine is the
[1:15:31] word all through the scripture God
[1:15:34] referred to Israel as a
[1:15:40] Vine the vine goes back to the tree of
[1:15:43] life that was in the Garden of
[1:15:45] Eden that tree of life was the vine it
[1:15:49] was the vine to give life to the people
[1:15:56] and what the foxes is after is to cut
[1:15:59] that life
[1:16:02] short is to cut the life if they can
[1:16:06] bite the vine they can destroy the life
[1:16:08] of the vine and we can just have form we
[1:16:12] can come we say we believe the message
[1:16:14] and there is nothing like the life of
[1:16:16] Jesus Christ nothing like the life that
[1:16:21] the prophet of God gave us
[1:16:28] praise the
[1:16:31] Lord you have a different Christmas
[1:16:34] message this year I just pray that the
[1:16:36] Lord will bless it and you'll see the
[1:16:38] direction that we are going in because
[1:16:41] that's that's the direction that we are
[1:16:42] going in

[1:17:27] than just a man this is a
[1:17:32] spirit this is a spirit how did they
[1:17:35] organize
[1:17:37] it you see the the spirit was watching
[1:17:41] every time he sees the word trying to
[1:17:44] come forth here is a prophet that was on
[1:17:48] the land a voice of one crying in the
[1:17:53] wilderness praise the Lord
[1:17:56] if if you go back and read history it
[1:17:58] will tell you that the
[1:18:01] Jews were not happy with Herod the antii
[1:18:06] because when he took his brother's wife
[1:18:10] he was breaking the Lord in Leviticus so
[1:18:13] they were not happy with him but why he
[1:18:16] went only after John the
[1:18:20] Baptist why he went only after John the
[1:18:22] Baptist
[1:18:26] because he had the message of the
[1:18:30] vine those other bunch of Jews they were
[1:18:33] all caught up in
[1:18:35] Traditions praise the Lord

[1:19:57] beautiful
[1:20:00] year it's
[1:20:04] uh I mean when you watch it and you you
[1:20:06] are able to to grab the
[1:20:17] picture so there was Herod the
[1:20:20] Great and there was Herod antias
[1:20:24] there was Herold Phillip so if you look
[1:20:28] there uh uh Antipas Herold Antipas took
[1:20:31] Phillip's wife because they were they
[1:20:34] were govering two different part one was
[1:20:38] in the sou part of Judah and one was in
[1:20:42] I think uh the western part of the
[1:20:44] northern part of
[1:20:45] Judah and uh uh uh
[1:20:58] then you go you read also over in the
[1:21:00] book of uh acts you see the Bible talks
[1:21:03] about uh agrea the one that Paul met he
[1:21:07] was also a Herod Herod the agrea and
[1:21:10] that's that's the second that Paul met
[1:21:14] that was Herod graa the
[1:21:17] first he actually was the one that
[1:21:19] killed James uh uh and and was
[1:21:22] determined to kill Peter
[1:21:25] before uh the angel of the law came down
[1:21:28] and delivered Peter out of the prison
[1:21:31] praise the Lord is uh it's it's very
[1:21:35] beautiful I don't want to go ahead of
[1:21:36] myself but uh I mean uh I'm just trying
[1:21:40] to hold this together for the Wednesday
[1:21:41] night and then uh uh by the help of the
[1:21:44] lord we will be able to look more into
[1:21:47] into it praise the Lord
[1:21:51] amen now so uh uh as we as we look as we
[1:21:56] look at this
[1:21:57] subject we see here
[1:22:00] that
[1:22:05] uh just like how the Roman
[1:22:08] govern and uh all they wanted is just to
[1:22:12] have the people under their control and
[1:22:15] just have peace in the land they never
[1:22:17] wanted to have no uproar there was no
[1:22:19] rioting no fighting nothing they just
[1:22:21] wanted to have peace in the land so I
[1:22:24] mean mean to put a governor over the
[1:22:25] people to govern the people and and it
[1:22:28] it's always like that you go back and
[1:22:30] read the book of uh of Danel or you read
[1:22:32] the book of Jeremiah you will see how uh
[1:22:35] the the king of Babylon set a a man of
[1:22:38] the people to rule the land and then
[1:22:40] gave you know report back to to the king
[1:22:42] of Babylon I mean that's that's how it
[1:22:44] is all over they just put a person there
[1:22:46] so it is the same thing here you know
[1:22:48] they put this uh uh uh uh uh uh Herod
[1:22:52] the Great to Rude and uh because this
[1:22:56] they think okay this is this is this is
[1:22:57] his people I mean if if this man can be
[1:23:00] able to raise a temple for this people I
[1:23:02] mean he he mimic he buil something so
[1:23:05] close to the Temple of Solomon you know
[1:23:07] that uh the the Jews were so pleased you
[1:23:10] know they told Jesus they said this
[1:23:12] Temple was in building for 40 plus years
[1:23:16] and you say you build it break it down
[1:23:18] and build it in in 3 days you don't know
[1:23:20] what you're talking about praise the
[1:23:23] Lord and you see and because he did that
[1:23:26] in some way he kind of forarm the heart
[1:23:30] of the
[1:23:31] Jews because he gave them a place of
[1:23:35] worship praise the
[1:23:38] Lord what is the need of giving a place
[1:23:40] of worship and you will now worship the
[1:23:42] god that the people are
[1:23:47] worshiping it was not
[1:23:50] enough praise the Lord but thou was a
[1:23:53] way because uh the the the the Jewish
[1:23:56] people were a religious people that was
[1:23:58] the way to be able to quiet a religious
[1:24:01] people just tell them the
[1:24:03] prophecy whether you slide one thing in
[1:24:06] or another the moment they hear the
[1:24:08] prophecy they're not going to
[1:24:09] questioning they're not even going back
[1:24:11] home to search whether it's truth or
[1:24:16] not just gave them something that will
[1:24:18] appease their
[1:24:22] religion praise the Lord
[1:24:26] give them something that will appease
[1:24:27] their religion quote quote the message
[1:24:29] of the hour that's that's all they
[1:24:37] need all the doctrines and Division and
[1:24:41] abuses and things that we have
[1:24:43] experienced around the message came from
[1:24:46] courts people were using courts to
[1:24:49] destroy churches and Destroy people life
[1:24:54] they were not cting from the
[1:25:01] Quran they were using C they were saying
[1:25:03] brother bandam sh they would call the
[1:25:05] year they would call the
[1:25:16] paragraph glory be to God praise the
[1:25:21] Lord but you know one time in the time
[1:25:24] of the
[1:25:25] judges praise the Lord God raised up a
[1:25:29] George called
[1:25:30] Samson and one time Samson was trying to
[1:25:33] to to get to get to this Philistine he
[1:25:36] was he was looking for the way something
[1:25:38] he could do to really get the attention
[1:25:41] of these Philistines you know what he
[1:25:42] did he grabbed
[1:25:46] foxes the Bible says he grab I didn't
[1:25:49] know how he do it but I just believe it
[1:25:50] was by inspiration he grabbed them and
[1:25:53] he Ted them he tied their
[1:25:56] tail two at a
[1:25:59] time and he put fire on their tail
[1:26:03] praise the Lord I believe that the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost is about to pour fire on some
[1:26:07] foxes that are highing in this message
[1:26:10] because God is raising up a bride that
[1:26:13] is not just going to take your word
[1:26:15] because you say brother brand I'm saved
[1:26:17] they're going to look in the scripture
[1:26:19] God is raising up a church that is going
[1:26:21] to require you to live what you preach
[1:26:25] don't come and tell brother Bram says
[1:26:27] you live What You
[1:26:41] Preach praise the
[1:26:43] Lord I'm telling you this message has
[1:26:46] raised up preachers like no other
[1:26:49] denomination has because every
[1:26:51] denomination has its qualification we we
[1:26:54] don't have anything a man go and pick up
[1:26:57] a semon book and and and you know and
[1:26:59] and he can quote brother Brandon he he
[1:27:00] start quoting and he start
[1:27:17] preaching this is what our lord said
[1:27:20] it's the foxes that has spoed this Vine
[1:27:26] this thing that was supposed to bring
[1:27:27] Deliverance it was supposed to be
[1:27:29] brother Bram says H
[1:27:31] H what's the message that he preached
[1:27:33] God reaching Mercy he said this message
[1:27:36] supposed to be an
[1:27:38] atonement because God raised up a
[1:27:41] Healing
[1:27:43] Ministry Divine Healing with a
[1:27:48] gift that could go back into the people
[1:27:50] life and and and and and and and and
[1:27:52] resolve their problem
[1:27:55] not only for healing but to to be able
[1:27:57] to tell them why they are dealing with
[1:27:59] this and why they are dealing with
[1:28:01] that and we can handle many things today
[1:28:04] just because of a gift that God brought
[1:28:07] to the
[1:28:09] Earth it was supposed to be an
[1:28:12] atonement but he said every time that
[1:28:14] God will raise up a gift the people will
[1:28:16] idolize
[1:28:17] it instead of it being a blessing to the
[1:28:20] people it becomes an idol
[1:28:29] praise the
[1:28:30] Lord but God is raising up a
[1:28:33] bride She's Not Just satisfied with our
[1:28:36] baptized in Jesus name She's Not Just
[1:28:39] satisfied with I believe the message she
[1:28:41] want this word to be made flesh in
[1:28:45] her praise the Lord she's not going to
[1:28:48] stop for nothing until she can see
[1:28:51] Christ on two feet amen

[1:29:03] it it's not a dress Cod it's a
[1:29:17] life be to
[1:29:19] God Solomon was writing his love note
[1:29:24] but he didn't know that he was
[1:29:28] prophesying he was
[1:29:31] prophesying some of the deepest prophecy
[1:29:34] of
[1:29:38] History praise the
[1:29:40] Lord he was prophesying identifying the
[1:29:44] two
[1:29:45] spirit that work in the

[1:39:36] Revival every move of God God was among

[1:39:44] hallelujah
[1:39:46] amen now something I was looking at
[1:39:48] let's go back a little bit and uh uh
[1:39:51] when you look in the
[1:39:54] you look in the uh concordance I was
[1:39:59] looking at this word when you when you
[1:40:02] uh uh you read over there in in in Songs
[1:40:05] of Solomon where it says uh take up the
[1:40:11] foxes the concordance always says this I
[1:40:15] mean it it says it was amazing it says
[1:40:18] to
[1:40:20] perceive to perceive to be able to look
[1:40:23] it says uh the ability to see beyond
[1:40:27] what is
[1:40:29] seen in the physical
[1:40:32] presence as a light piercing through
[1:40:35] Darkness so when when the When when when
[1:40:38] when uh uh uh uh Solomon said take take
[1:40:42] us the
[1:40:44] foxes is speaking
[1:40:48] more than things that we can see with
[1:40:50] our natural eyes
[1:40:54] praise the Lord
[1:40:56] amen it didn't say take up the foxes it
[1:41:00] said take us the
[1:41:04] foxes it's a kind of a language is it's
[1:41:07] a it's a prophetic
[1:41:10] language that make us to look Beyond far
[1:41:13] beyond what we are seeing with our
[1:41:16] natural
[1:41:18] eyes praise the Lord because if it's the
[1:41:22] foxes that spoil the
[1:41:25] vine and if it's a spiritual thing that
[1:41:28] is going on we're not going to see it
[1:41:30] with our natural
[1:41:32] eyes unless the Holy Ghost rever it
[1:41:35] unless God expose it we're not going to
[1:41:39] see
[1:41:40] it praise the
[1:41:42] Lord and that is the same thing that is
[1:41:45] happening I mean people said right honor
[1:41:47] the reveal word they s under the word
[1:41:49] the message of the they hear the voice
[1:41:51] of God
[1:41:53] praise the
[1:41:56] Lord and He the hold to things in their
[1:41:59] heart and the hold to attitude how we
[1:42:01] relating to this world what we take the
[1:42:03] message to be is the person of Jesus
[1:42:09] Christ it's the person of Jesus
[1:42:12] Christ praise the Lord but you see it it
[1:42:16] is it's it's just like if he was here in
[1:42:19] person see he went over to Simon house
[1:42:22] what did they do they just set him in a
[1:42:24] corner with some dirad feet nobody was
[1:42:27] paying attention to him and that is the
[1:42:29] very same thing that we are doing we get
[1:42:31] the word on tape we get it on our phone
[1:42:33] we get it on our laptop we get it on
[1:42:36] everything but it's just there nobody
[1:42:38] paying
[1:42:40] attention to this living Christ that is
[1:42:43] in our
[1:42:48] midst this is not a cult it's not a
[1:42:50] society that we have drawn
[1:42:53] it's not a
[1:42:55] movement this is the Living God among
[1:42:58] his
[1:43:01] people a word that has come to change
[1:43:04] our
[1:43:07] life praise the Lord it has come to
[1:43:10] change our life the prophet of God said
[1:43:12] it has come to make us better neighbors
[1:43:15] to our neighbors it has come to make us
[1:43:18] better parents to our children better
[1:43:20] wives to our husband better husband to
[1:43:23] our wife that's why we must be looking
[1:43:26] for how is the word making me better
[1:43:30] that's why we must be looking for how is
[1:43:32] this word making me
[1:43:52] better the ability to see
[1:43:55] beyond what is seen with the physical
[1:43:57] presence as a light piercing in
[1:44:02] darkness as a light piercing in
[1:44:08] darkness as a light piercing in darkness
[1:44:13] to be able to
[1:44:17] perceive because it's a
[1:44:20] spirit it's not an individual it's a
[1:44:23] spirit that comes on
[1:44:25] people it's a spirit that is Waring
[1:44:29] against this
[1:44:32] word that don't want you and myself to
