[36:14] moses praise the lord
[36:19] [Music]
[36:24] amen
[36:27] we testified last week
[36:34] the accident that the lord
[36:38] saved our brother from but i don't know
[36:41] if it was much of a true testimony
[36:46] because to be a true witness you have to
[36:48] either see it
[36:50] or you know
[36:53] witness the scene of you know year from
[36:57] from the scene so we would just give
[37:00] maybe uh five minutes to bear moses

[37:07] we'll be hearing from the hershey's
[37:09] mouth himself
[37:11] praise the lord so come about moses
[37:13] before we
[37:14] change the order of our service here
[37:16] [Music]
[37:20] amen
[37:23] [Music]
[37:33] why this is not my first experience
[37:37] of going through accidents i think since
[37:40] i
[37:41] took on the cross back home and here
[37:45] i have gone similar accident more than
[37:47] five times and everything i walk
[37:51] put out and all the cars beyond repair
[37:55] but sometimes when you are on the front
[37:58] line
[37:59] for god and you become fearless
[38:02] general sometimes you become the target
[38:08] in my own where i came from there have
[38:11] been no church
[38:12] and no mass since that time was
[38:15] established
[38:17] nobody worship anything beside
[38:19] worshiping their rivers and trees
[38:21] my magical father was like the prince
[38:26] he worshiped snake at that time he took
[38:29] us to the snake he worshiped and made
[38:31] sacrifices
[38:32] when i was growing up so
[38:36] when god called me there have been a lot
[38:38] of opposition for church going through
[38:41] our culture and without no fear
[38:46] and even willing to die for the cost
[38:50] church is there right now people are
[38:51] worshiping
[38:54] and before i had an accident
[38:58] a few gram relatives that we had a
[39:01] conflict
[39:02] misunderstanding because of some of the
[39:06] principles doctrines we believe in as
[39:09] christians
[39:10] especially taking my girl's children to
[39:12] sunday butch
[39:15] they want to initiate my gosh into the
[39:17] sunday butch
[39:19] and it is against the culture to
[39:22] explain so i told them that if i want to
[39:25] do female mutilations
[39:27] i better prefer them to go to the
[39:29] hospital
[39:30] than to take the in the culture and that
[39:32] was complete violation
[39:35] of their faith to expose that so then on
[39:38] a struggle
[39:39] so god revealed to me and i
[39:43] sent the dreams two weeks ago what was
[39:46] going to happen to me
[39:48] so i was coming from work by 11
[39:52] and on that day i was playing on music
[39:55] in the car called
[39:57] you told your girl and my god told me
[40:00] you carry a gun and my god carry me
[40:04] that's amazing i'll play in the car and
[40:07] right around here while i was coming
[40:11] i saw a suv jeep coming
[40:14] from the street controlling this main uh
[40:17] avenue but i saw a light in his car
[40:21] but all i thought that he came to stop
[40:23] because he needed to stop
[40:25] before getting on the avenue but
[40:28] just reaching the only thing i remember
[40:32] was
[40:35] and i saw the lightning and the next
[40:38] thing i saw that
[40:40] i was in a bubble you know what i call
[40:42] bubble right
[40:43] like millions of balloons or just fill
[40:46] the car that's all i can remember
[40:49] and after that the doctor was just
[40:53] asking me i was thinking i said but
[40:54] what's happening
[40:56] before they showed my pictures and stuff
[40:59] like that
[41:01] uh so the movie i like me to shake
[41:04] because you're thinking about my spinal
[41:05] cord
[41:06] and stuff like that so they killed me
[41:09] through all the x-ray
[41:10] everything i know ems or what kind of
[41:13] stuff
[41:14] put me through this type of stuff
[41:17] so just to call it shot the doctor king
[41:20] told me guess what
[41:22] i said what he said it just looked like
[41:24] the way your mother born you
[41:27] nothing happened
[41:31] so i said god has done it again so she
[41:34] asked me
[41:35] who are you i said i'm a christian
[41:39] he said god bless you because i never
[41:41] see shows as accident
[41:43] and no wound no bruise so i just want to
[41:46] give god the glory
[41:55] [Applause]
[41:59] and that's brother moses
[42:04] that's not even uh that is just a little
[42:08] piece out of the
[42:09] the aspect that the people will say

[48:30] i sing because
[48:37] oh yes
[48:41] i said because
[48:46] i'm free
[48:47] [Music]
[49:00] is
[49:06] [Music]
[49:15] because i'm happy
[49:20] oh yes i say
[49:25] because i'm free
[49:33] [Music]
[49:54] praise the lord we just want to be
[49:56] grateful and
[49:58] thank the lord for everything he's doing
[50:01] and this week i was
[50:05] uh now to see it a little bit under the
[50:08] weather
[50:08] not on the weather but i just got so
[50:11] tired
[50:12] from from the service last week
[50:16] sunday praise the lord
[50:19] and i wanted to read a quote that i sent
[50:21] out there
[50:23] and let me see if i can take that up
[50:26] here
[50:27] you know brother branham shared this and
[50:29] he said
[50:32] praise the lord amen
[50:36] you love the lord praise the lord
[50:40] he's a wonderful wonderful lord jesus
[50:43] and we
[50:43] we love him glory be to god
[50:54] he said is in the message what is a
[50:57] vision
[50:58] and he said now when jesus
[51:02] raised lazarus from the grave
[51:05] it was more it was
[51:09] more of a miracle than
[51:12] what the woman that touched his
[51:16] garment and was healed
[51:19] with the blood issue
[51:22] you were made there he never said
[51:26] one word about getting weak and
[51:29] virtue going out of him because god
[51:33] was using his gift in as much as both of
[51:36] them was a miracle
[51:38] you know lazarus came from the grave
[51:40] after being dead
[51:41] four days but he raised lazarus from the
[51:46] grave on the vision god revealed to him
[51:50] you know the lord told him not to go at
[51:52] the time lazarus was sick
[51:54] you know because the death of lazarus
[51:56] was going to be to the glory of god
[51:59] so god already told him what was
[52:00] happening so
[52:02] he went and then uh
[52:05] you know he he raised lazarus but it was
[52:07] different with the woman
[52:09] with the blood issue it was her face
[52:12] you know she said it in her heart i know
[52:16] if i touch the arm of his garment i will
[52:19] be healed
[52:20] so brother branham was saying one
[52:23] it was god's using the gift
[52:26] and the woman touching jesus it was the
[52:30] woman that was
[52:31] operating the gift because it was the
[52:34] womb of faith that was reaching out for
[52:36] healing
[52:38] with the raising of lazarus it was god
[52:40] that revered to jesus
[52:42] that larger was going to come from the
[52:44] grave and nothing could stop it
[52:47] praise the lord but the the thing about
[52:50] it there is the other
[52:52] when he raised lazarus from the from the
[52:54] grave
[52:55] he never said that you left him
[52:58] but when the woman used the gift
[53:02] he did not have strength because that's
[53:04] you left him amen
[53:07] and uh
[53:08] [Music]
[53:10] so but when people
[53:14] use the gift of god that's what makes me
[53:16] weak
[53:17] he was referring to the healing ministry
[53:20] now
[53:21] so on the platform as you yourself and
[53:23] that's
[53:24] and and that's what is doing it
[53:28] you yourself is working uh the operation
[53:32] and and that's the reason
[53:33] it's pulling true is either you are
[53:36] using
[53:37] god's gift or god using his gift amen
[53:42] whichever way the gift of god is going
[53:44] to be yours praise the lord
[53:46] but for some reason i was just so out of
[53:48] faith during the week
[53:50] if you notice me wednesday night evening
[53:52] i was i was a bit tired
[53:53] yesterday i was just honored a very
[53:56] strong headache
[53:58] and so i need your prayers pray for me
[54:03] as i do the same for you and so brother
[54:06] joseph will speak to us this morning
[54:08] he will bring the word let just stand on
[54:10] our feet and
[54:12] and we will sing a song and ask our
[54:15] brother to come
[54:17] and bring the word this morning and
[54:20] [Music]
[54:22] praise the lord and i was thinking about
[54:25] us sinking
[54:26] this song
[54:38] i'm just a sinner saved by grace
[54:40] [Music]
[54:47] let's just worship the lord

[1:04:46] thing i said wow

[1:11:50] away because he doesn't want to pray for
[1:11:51] him
[1:11:52] before they can talk talk talk but when
[1:11:55] he come back
[1:11:58] it was for the glory of god
[1:12:01] you know sometimes that's why the bible
[1:12:05] said
[1:12:05] all things work together for good
[1:12:08] that scripture i don't know we just
[1:12:10] repeat it's just a say
[1:12:12] oh because the bible said sometimes
[1:12:14] scriptures
[1:12:15] must be materialized
[1:12:19] we are the spirit people
[1:12:22] when god created adam adam was
[1:12:26] a spirit that's the adam
[1:12:29] was equal with god he created
[1:12:33] him as a spirit and was controlling
[1:12:36] everything and he formed
[1:12:40] a body he put that adam's spirit
[1:12:43] in eternal form he brought him
[1:12:46] in the in the time of body
[1:12:56] then trouble came because when he was
[1:12:58] before he come in the flesh
[1:13:00] the devil couldn't touch him when he's
[1:13:03] in the body
[1:13:04] the devil's now see he starts to see
[1:13:06] clear he can
[1:13:07] know and he can touch but he tried him
[1:13:09] it couldn't
[1:13:10] because he was not by product
[1:13:15] when he saw a woman by product is it
[1:13:17] this one i can touch
[1:13:19] praise god god always
[1:13:23] on time everything comes for good
[1:13:28] i always tell my wife i said
[1:13:31] uh you know what whatever problem come
[1:13:35] to you
[1:13:36] at work in the family
[1:13:40] just try to found a benefit side of it
[1:13:45] and i love pasta one day i was saying
[1:13:48] sometimes people there some people they
[1:13:50] i always say him pastor they are using
[1:13:52] you you know pastor
[1:13:54] he said hey joseph yes you are so fast
[1:13:56] you're so he said
[1:13:58] anyone no matter how bad they can be
[1:14:01] there is
[1:14:01] always a good sign
[1:14:04] hello yeah that is it's a wisdom
[1:14:08] yeah it's a reason we say there is
[1:14:10] always that's why i said i can know
[1:14:12] someone is using me but i want to find
[1:14:14] a benefit but for him where i can have
[1:14:17] something
[1:14:18] i never see that way that's him
[1:14:21] and he had something and i took it
[1:14:24] as in my life i've learned and it helped
[1:14:27] me at work
[1:14:30] it's work most of the time you can see
[1:14:33] most of african
[1:14:35] they they want to gather you feel like
[1:14:38] they always want to work together even
[1:14:40] when they send me
[1:14:42] the first time or before i get used to
[1:14:44] to to work the managers they send me in
[1:14:46] the africans
[1:14:48] they can be americans or from overseas
[1:14:51] but
[1:14:52] to train me they feel me covered they
[1:14:54] say
[1:14:55] joseph are you okay they say i'm fine
[1:14:59] so i realized that when they said i said
[1:15:01] they don't know i'm a ego
[1:15:04] i am an ego i can manage everywhere
[1:15:10] when they asked me a shift
[1:15:15] i said i need the second shift the first
[1:15:17] one is the morning if there is no
[1:15:19] morning the second choice is the second
[1:15:21] shift
[1:15:22] and there is in second shift there is no
[1:15:24] african
[1:15:25] are you sure i say i'm sure they put
[1:15:28] them in the second shift
[1:15:29] they came after a week joseph are you
[1:15:32] okay
[1:15:32] as i'm very good more than that team i
[1:15:36] was
[1:15:43] a lot of people you know sometimes
[1:15:44] someone who can judge before you
[1:15:46] approach him don't judge
[1:15:49] before you approach him i always i'm
[1:15:52] sorry i always
[1:15:53] mention my wife because she's my friend
[1:15:56] i talk too much when my the same one is
[1:15:59] too much i preached to her hey wake up
[1:16:01] jesus said jesus said he said amen he
[1:16:03] was a good same one
[1:16:04] she's my puppet so i always talk to her
[1:16:07] like that
[1:16:09] yeah so most of the time i talk to her
[1:16:11] don't be offended when i mention

[1:16:18] much i'm sorry babe now i'm
[1:16:20] fine i float i'll float
[1:16:23] hallelujah yeah so i always tell
[1:16:26] sometimes
[1:16:28] we've got a habit of when someone
[1:16:31] gives you a information he will never
[1:16:34] tell you
[1:16:35] how it to start that if he was wrong or
[1:16:38] not he always tell
[1:16:39] what they told him or what he
[1:16:42] he received from other person he did
[1:16:46] this
[1:16:48] and what did you do before he started to
[1:16:50] do that
[1:16:53] my mom always have a problem with me
[1:16:57] your aunt you aren't your aunt my sister
[1:16:59] came here
[1:17:00] we must not go there we must just cut it
[1:17:03] barrier they are not i say hey
[1:17:06] come that she is
[1:17:09] a young sister as we are children
[1:17:15] when you do that when they fixed it will
[1:17:17] be difficult for you to fix
[1:17:19] then they can fix fast you have to know
[1:17:22] what happened no one is my mom
[1:17:25] i said mom tell me just stop the story
[1:17:28] start to relate
[1:17:30] [Music]

[1:17:36] me your mother said but you're wrong
[1:17:39] you're not supposed to do that so i
[1:17:41] always are we
[1:17:42] me i will never take side when i didn't
[1:17:44] hear opposite side
[1:17:45] never that is making me a little bit
[1:17:49] a little bit wise in a problem
[1:17:52] yeah sometimes you don't take my side i
[1:17:54] can't i will never take the side
[1:17:56] until i hear another side you're my wife
[1:17:59] yes
[1:18:00] first i hear another side then i'll
[1:18:03] protect you as my wife
[1:18:04] you are wrong but you know adam he knew
[1:18:06] she was wrong she just fall because
[1:18:08] love but she knew that she was wrong
[1:18:12] yeah i want that to hear him oh we are
[1:18:14] wrong we are all of us
[1:18:16] wrong like i always said if she doesn't
[1:18:18] pay tight i pay tight
[1:18:20] it's that means she's dancing we don't
[1:18:23] pay tight
[1:18:25] that's that's the way i took if i pay
[1:18:27] she doesn't we
[1:18:28] don't that's the way i took
[1:18:31] that's the way i judge that's where i
[1:18:33] work because
[1:18:34] remember when there is a mistake of
[1:18:38] someone it costs all their family
[1:18:41] always it's because of the family that's
[1:18:44] why
[1:18:46] the brotherhood always he said that we
[1:18:48] must have a communication of your wife
[1:18:51] you must be closer you must be friend
[1:18:54] to succeed i'm telling you
[1:18:59] most of people they succeeded
[1:19:02] when they are friend with their wives
[1:19:06] even if the politicians you know obama
[1:19:08] the way he is if you see his story they
[1:19:11] see obama he brought the style of
[1:19:14] people they start even if to work with
[1:19:15] their wife with hand
[1:19:17] yeah people now they are they are
[1:19:18] comfortable most of the time people they
[1:19:21] live in africa they never
[1:19:22] go with their wife's president no the
[1:19:24] wife will be behind him
[1:19:26] is the president you're president of
[1:19:27] your wife
[1:19:30] he's around in the front the wife is
[1:19:32] following like a like
[1:19:34] helper
[1:19:39] praise god give them for the lord
[1:19:42] amen amen
[1:19:44] [Applause]
[1:19:49] this woman she found the opportunity
[1:19:52] she said i perceive you a messiah
[1:19:56] now i don't want to go that side of the
[1:19:59] second husband there's another preaching
[1:20:01] that let her put aside i want you to put
[1:20:04] attention
[1:20:05] the true worshipers worship the father
[1:20:08] in the spirit and in the truth
[1:20:11] that's where there is a many problem
[1:20:14] even in the assembly of the message
[1:20:18] you know where you are sitting there do
[1:20:21] you know that you are not you
[1:20:23] are you is inside of you
[1:20:28] you get used for this 16 element
[1:20:31] and you forget a real of you keep them
[1:20:34] for the lord
[1:20:36] [Applause]
[1:20:39] so if you start to train yourself to
[1:20:42] know
[1:20:42] area of you then you start to be strong
[1:20:45] that's why i don't judge people by
[1:20:48] seeing by church by tribe i judge people
[1:20:51] by my heart
[1:20:53] ah thank god because when i just met
[1:20:55] somebody oh we are connected god bless
[1:20:57] my brother and finish
[1:20:59] baby they can see his bodies i'm
[1:21:01] connected i don't know why
[1:21:03] we we can't stop it
[1:21:06] there's something it's a link
[1:21:10] yeah but what i'm saying some people
[1:21:12] they're good but you can't be
[1:21:14] comfortable to be among them
[1:21:17] and you can't force it you can't it's
[1:21:20] something
[1:21:21] you have to know that's why to judge you
[1:21:23] must be a spiritual also to judge
[1:21:26] right
[1:21:31] at work i met those people they said
[1:21:33] they were bad bad but
[1:21:35] that's the those people they teach me
[1:21:38] very good
[1:21:39] work than african i told my wife only
[1:21:42] one
[1:21:42] kick i mean i must have the machines one
[1:21:45] kick
[1:21:46] they would with love you can feel so i
[1:21:48] understand that it's because they judge
[1:21:49] by far
[1:21:50] and there's a problem of english it's
[1:21:52] not their first english some
[1:21:54] most they came from like puerto rico
[1:21:56] they came from
[1:21:57] you know neighbor countries here
[1:22:02] mexico it's like me it's by the grace of
[1:22:05] god i can preach
[1:22:07] in french in english is the grace of god
[1:22:09] english is
[1:22:10] difficult for us sometimes even if how
[1:22:12] are you they don't know any drc
[1:22:14] but the grace of god god sent me to
[1:22:16] south africa he teach me english he
[1:22:18] brought me his character and they
[1:22:20] brought me here
[1:22:22] then i can communicate in english and
[1:22:24] you are enjoying my english is clear
[1:22:25] right
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:30] praise god praise god praise god
[1:22:33] so when you don't approach them you can
[1:22:37] judge wrong may i understand is english
[1:22:40] is a language
[1:22:42] they they feel comfortable when they
[1:22:44] speak their
[1:22:45] spanish
[1:22:48] you know and they feel nice but when you
[1:22:51] come how are you can you explain to me
[1:22:52] what that
[1:22:55] is you can even if you do do this
[1:22:58] it's like dictating you know they don't
[1:23:00] know if sometimes it's the english
[1:23:02] language
[1:23:03] i take that side ah
[1:23:06] like this this
[1:23:10] ah okay i know
[1:23:13] now i memorized this thing must be the
[1:23:16] left that one in the right
[1:23:17] and this is oh okay thank you is a good
[1:23:19] teacher and i'm going like that
[1:23:21] so you know information then when
[1:23:24] they come to me they said ah are you
[1:23:26] okay this is the best
[1:23:28] team ever this one huh are you sure
[1:23:32] yes that's the way i i exercise my
[1:23:35] christianity
[1:23:36] that's the way i live i don't preach
[1:23:38] things just to preach to feel to make
[1:23:40] you to feel good
[1:23:41] i love to preach my life
[1:23:44] that's me i love to preach in my life i
[1:23:46] like to preach what i'm going through
[1:23:48] that's why one day they asked me to to
[1:23:50] preach on the wedding in zimbabwe
[1:23:53] the elder they sit there i wasn't yet
[1:23:56] married
[1:23:57] then they said in the convention they
[1:24:00] can
[1:24:01] make the convention combined meeting i
[1:24:02] preach friday evening
[1:24:05] saturday morning evening saturday joins
[1:24:09] alone i'm preaching all the but when we
[1:24:11] reach
[1:24:12] marriage issue i don't have experience
[1:24:17] what can what can i tell them
[1:24:21] i don't just preach brother i refuse
[1:24:23] that the first time i refute the puppet
[1:24:26] people are sitting there hey sorry
[1:24:29] i can sing not this one
[1:24:32] i don't want to preach things that's why
[1:24:35] it doesn't
[1:24:35] bring life it doesn't help people
[1:24:37] because we preach things we don't know
[1:24:40] we don't have experience we never go
[1:24:42] through
[1:24:48] praise god
[1:24:51] we are the spirit people
[1:24:54] we are getting used to the physical
[1:24:58] that's why when you want to understand
[1:25:00] the message
[1:25:01] with your intellect with your spirit
[1:25:05] with your body you will always get wrong
[1:25:10] always that's why i always repeat this
[1:25:13] i don't know we will understand it's
[1:25:15] fine i can't explain i always
[1:25:17] tell you what random said i saw the
[1:25:20] third po
[1:25:22] wow so great
[1:25:26] so big that's why it was a silence
[1:25:31] but i must not say about it
[1:25:35] it's a reveal six it didn't reveal a
[1:25:37] seven
[1:25:38] but they asked a question it's not
[1:25:39] reveal seven say it's a reveal
[1:25:41] it was a reveal so tell me how i'm going
[1:25:44] to explain that
[1:25:46] people they want to these things you
[1:25:47] can't explain it
[1:25:49] it's a language it's you have to hit the
[1:25:51] target the mark it's not
[1:25:53] some there is no vocabulary to explain
[1:25:55] it
[1:25:57] there is no that's why you asked why you
[1:25:59] that's why i said
[1:26:00] well if you don't understand it didn't
[1:26:03] say ask
[1:26:05] have a good life pray go to church
[1:26:10] it's not even for everybody to
[1:26:11] understand it
[1:26:14] if someone says not reveal yes
[1:26:17] understand him is not revealed for him
[1:26:20] but it's revealed for you why are you
[1:26:23] arguing
[1:26:24] and the internet you are using there is
[1:26:26] a lot of evil and information there
[1:26:29] you must be careful when they are giving
[1:26:31] you they started to analyze cloud
[1:26:34] is not for them it's for
[1:26:37] you so why do you want to hear from them
[1:26:40] and which benefit they're going to help
[1:26:42] you
[1:26:42] when you hear their their google google
[1:26:45] know the cloud
[1:26:47] google not the third pool he doesn't
[1:26:50] know nothing about the cloud
[1:26:52] it doesn't have about the third pool it
[1:26:53] doesn't know about the angel nothing
[1:26:55] guru what is the cloud they're going to
[1:26:57] give you the wrong answer
[1:26:58] some people they ask google cloud they
[1:27:00] took the answer of the google out of the
[1:27:02] message
[1:27:02] if you need the proof in the message
[1:27:04] you'll prove out
[1:27:07] i'm telling you is there something you
[1:27:09] can't explain but it's
[1:27:10] real because the real few are the
[1:27:13] spiritual but the problem is explaining
[1:27:15] even if you bar yourself if we break we
[1:27:18] break we break is good to
[1:27:19] to invisible these bodies can be
[1:27:22] invisible we can vanish
[1:27:24] because you came from the invisible to
[1:27:27] the visible any of you
[1:27:29] is invisible clapton for the lord
[1:27:34] we believe in invisible that's where we
[1:27:38] came from
[1:27:39] in the body now to to catch this
[1:27:42] message you must be able to go back to
[1:27:46] the invisible
[1:27:49] then you can you can know any of you
[1:27:53] hey you sometimes want to say something
[1:27:55] he said i don't know if you are going to
[1:27:57] understand it
[1:27:59] and they said another way another way do
[1:28:01] you know that
[1:28:02] some people they were with branham those
[1:28:03] days they didn't even have the ability
[1:28:06] to understand the message
[1:28:07] like us this age do you know that
[1:28:12] because now everything is open
[1:28:15] we are in the sodomik atmosphere
[1:28:20] you can't even tell can you go to the
[1:28:22] surgery they choose gender
[1:28:25] it's open protected
[1:28:29] is there now we got people there is a
[1:28:33] church
[1:28:34] they worship brahmo god you can't help
[1:28:37] them
[1:28:38] they are there and those things you have
[1:28:40] to know they are there
[1:28:41] but the problem is what is your position
[1:28:44] you
[1:28:45] as a bride what is your position
[1:28:49] when you look the prophet
[1:28:53] you look him as like who how did you see
[1:28:58] a man they come to see jesus
[1:29:02] they stuck on the body because what that
[1:29:04] what they're
[1:29:05] not supposed to see they must see the
[1:29:07] invisible and invisible to sit must go
[1:29:09] to the ground to die
[1:29:10] and they will see more and the
[1:29:11] manifestation of them invisible even if
[1:29:13] you see it
[1:29:14] you can't sit with your eyes physically
[1:29:16] as these are spiritual
[1:29:17] eyes church let us go back that's why i
[1:29:20] always say surrender
[1:29:21] when i mean surrender it means you must
[1:29:23] just feel like you don't know nothing we
[1:29:25] don't know
[1:29:26] nothing until the one who knows
[1:29:28] everything enter in you
[1:29:30] if it's himself and you re believe his
[1:29:33] own word
[1:29:34] that's where we are we must reach level
[1:29:36] grab the head for the lord
[1:29:39] [Applause]
[1:29:42] because the word of god is powerful
[1:29:46] the word of god it's powerful because
[1:29:48] what
[1:29:49] you can see and the touch can it came
[1:29:52] from
[1:29:52] for what you can't see so what is the
[1:29:55] real
[1:29:56] the real is invisible
[1:29:59] make it put in because this but that's
[1:30:01] why i was calling this bar
[1:30:02] full of nonsense this body don't give
[1:30:06] anything she want it want this body full
[1:30:08] and it will never say thank you you're
[1:30:11] giving us food
[1:30:12] you need again what another suit this is
[1:30:15] what no if
[1:30:16] another one any airplane nothing nothing
[1:30:19] no sense
[1:30:23] no sense today you wake up you are okay
[1:30:26] tomorrow you are weak and now you are
[1:30:29] sick
[1:30:30] happy when you are happy and i want to
[1:30:32] notice when you wake up you feel like
[1:30:33] happiness you must go to pray before the
[1:30:35] day finish you'll be sad
[1:30:37] i always notice that when i'm happy
[1:30:40] start to pray
[1:30:42] god to protect you when that sadness
[1:30:44] will come
[1:30:46] you know that's the body so they
[1:30:49] real the worshiper they must worship in
[1:30:52] this truth and the spirit
[1:30:53] what is the truth the truth is the
[1:30:55] message of your time
[1:30:57] because you can even the spirit but with
[1:31:00] a pastor's message it will never help
[1:31:02] you
[1:31:04] it will never help you that's why when
[1:31:06] she hit the target
[1:31:07] she met the right one at the right time
[1:31:10] she was blessed
[1:31:12] and the right one said hey not jerusalem
[1:31:16] the father always like to worship him in
[1:31:18] the
[1:31:19] spirit and the spirit is
[1:31:22] another world the spirit that's why baba
[1:31:25] said
[1:31:26] you can create in your own world
[1:31:29] you know when you i'm gonna just give
[1:31:32] you a something you can practice

[1:31:48] down
[1:31:49] don't wait to be more stop start
[1:31:52] praying start to pick yourself up
[1:31:54] because paul said
[1:31:56] we make slide every day it means that
[1:31:59] it it becomes gradually now when it
[1:32:01] becomes a big gap now we see you check
[1:32:03] you become a problem

[1:32:31] puppy just pray
[1:32:33] and pray and cry and pray is what it
[1:32:36] doesn't mean he's a sinner
[1:32:38] no we want to be picked up
[1:32:43] we are not the professional in the world
[1:32:46] there is no one is professional
[1:32:48] all of us we are dealing with our staff
[1:32:51] everyone here and i'm gonna tell you
[1:32:55] something the message believe that
[1:32:56] they've got to attitude when a preacher
[1:32:59] preached
[1:32:59] said who wanted the holy spirit they're
[1:33:02] looking at their back
[1:33:04] you're the one at the back you need it
[1:33:08] do you know that someone with a holy
[1:33:10] spirit is third he always wants
[1:33:12] more more more you will never feel that
[1:33:14] it's enough it
[1:33:15] will never reach that level
[1:33:19] always down they want they want you to
[1:33:21] never when you feel you are enough
[1:33:23] you are already in a problem then we got
[1:33:26] a problem
[1:33:27] praise god
[1:33:31] hallelujah i didn't start it's okay
[1:33:34] let us read a first chord
[1:33:41] in the meanest man in santa maria
[1:33:45] paragraph seven
[1:33:49] and there been a shoe cover blind
[1:33:53] from up somewhere above i forgot the
[1:33:56] name of the serum
[1:33:57] now close to just borrow about
[1:34:01] 30 40 miles
[1:34:04] and it been blind for years and the
[1:34:07] holy sp holy spirit had pronounced him
[1:34:10] here
[1:34:11] and he went around come back
[1:34:15] in line again said you said sir
[1:34:18] i was healed my eyes are not open
[1:34:22] i said that is nothing to do with it
[1:34:26] you told me you believed me he said
[1:34:30] i do i said then why are you
[1:34:33] questioning me and so he said he went on
[1:34:37] i said just keep saying praise the lord
[1:34:41] for my side hallelujah and it was going
[1:34:45] home that morning i stopped first day
[1:34:48] before we continue there is a
[1:34:51] problem for a motto to believe a motto
[1:34:56] it's a that's where that's where we
[1:34:58] stuck
[1:35:02] because you must believe on me
[1:35:06] to believe to god
[1:35:10] that's the formula
[1:35:14] there is there is only ordained the
[1:35:17] people
[1:35:18] god or then with the gift to use is
[1:35:21] going to use them
[1:35:22] it gives them an element to preach you
[1:35:24] with that's the gift
[1:35:26] and that's why we always pray put me out
[1:35:28] of my way
[1:35:29] you enter in your gift that a gift it's
[1:35:32] a it's
[1:35:33] it it's it's a device it's application
[1:35:36] to make that device to work
[1:35:38] and when that is activated with the
[1:35:41] anointing
[1:35:42] with the life with the holy spirit god
[1:35:45] used that application to make that
[1:35:48] device to work and they connect to you
[1:35:51] because
[1:35:51] us we are not a preacher that's why we
[1:35:54] are s is like a preacher we are like the
[1:35:56] preachers
[1:35:56] the preacher is god himself
[1:36:02] but when i ask do you believe me
[1:36:07] he didn't say do you believe god
[1:36:09] everyone can say believe god
[1:36:12] the time you and how we are living
[1:36:15] is to believe men to cross and
[1:36:18] to see what is in the man because we
[1:36:21] hear with the ears
[1:36:23] we risen with this this this head you
[1:36:26] know the barrel
[1:36:27] ever thought is in your mind
[1:36:31] how many mind a human being think bidet
[1:36:34] do you know how many more than 60
[1:36:38] 000 thought
[1:36:42] what are you sitting there coming
[1:36:46] that's why we create atmosphere music
[1:36:48] music are very dangerous because the
[1:36:50] music
[1:36:51] conscience it can go straight to
[1:36:52] subconscious that's why you have to know
[1:36:55] which kind of music are you listening
[1:36:57] that person is a singing you've got a
[1:36:59] life of god or you just follow the beat
[1:37:03] i always tell my wife i said that's me
[1:37:06] if you don't believe this it's okay it's
[1:37:07] not the scripture
[1:37:09] i just think it's simple i know there's
[1:37:11] some unbeliever oh those pentecostals
[1:37:13] they sing a good song
[1:37:14] it's fine for me joseph
[1:37:17] i can take that song for domo
[1:37:21] and whatever but when a brother
[1:37:24] or a sister sing now the same song it
[1:37:27] become another song because it comes
[1:37:30] from
[1:37:31] you now there are no things from you now
[1:37:34] and
[1:37:34] you pray you surrender and we sing it
[1:37:38] i'm not a legalistic said don't don't
[1:37:40] even song no no no no no
[1:37:42] i don't me understand that way because
[1:37:43] when you take those words
[1:37:45] you start to sing because those are
[1:37:46] without the word a good word but the
[1:37:48] problem the one who's
[1:37:49] singing it that's the problem
[1:37:54] you you can take those words you pray
[1:37:57] you practice you sing you can bless us
[1:38:00] more than
[1:38:01] the one who wrote it come on church
[1:38:07] that's true they can be inspired with a
[1:38:09] good word but the problem is
[1:38:10] the life in the world there is a subname
[1:38:17] information go through the song
[1:38:21] through the preaching there is one
[1:38:23] brother
[1:38:24] since he believed the message in congo
[1:38:28] he was just holy you know that was fear
[1:38:29] of his holiness a prayer whatever
[1:38:31] he never followed a woman he was just
[1:38:34] always picked up spiritually
[1:38:36] fighting and when he came to south
[1:38:38] africa
[1:38:40] he didn't choose right to change
[1:38:43] come african sometimes it's okay but not
[1:38:45] me sometimes i just pray and go
[1:38:47] where i feel they were they constituted
[1:38:51] a lot of congolese it was the pictures
[1:38:54] all of them they beat the support room i
[1:38:57] came
[1:38:57] i spoke with the pastor five minutes
[1:39:01] i came out we are going to these
[1:39:02] churches i will never come to these
[1:39:04] churches
[1:39:04] why this pastor need
[1:39:08] god you are proud it's fine go i just
[1:39:12] give you
[1:39:12] three years or four you tell me i always
[1:39:16] go and see them when the musician comes
[1:39:17] the
[1:39:18] focus comes after three years and four
[1:39:23] it was breaking virginity of
[1:39:26] sisters in the church women often not
[1:39:29] yet
[1:39:29] and they are preaching a powerful and
[1:39:30] the people they were dancing and jumping
[1:39:33] the anointing oh god help us
[1:39:37] so after decide to come to how did you
[1:39:38] know i said i don't know i can't explain
[1:39:41] it
[1:39:42] why it can preach a good semen
[1:39:46] people they jump but when it's preaching
[1:39:48] it doesn't leave the message the life of
[1:39:50] the bible the message or whatever i can
[1:39:52] call it when it doesn't have
[1:39:54] the life of god the message is giving to
[1:39:57] you is what
[1:39:58] is is a sub no me no message that's why
[1:40:01] if these
[1:40:01] rappers they can wrap wrap rap they
[1:40:03] don't say anything
[1:40:04] but after listening that that that song
[1:40:07] they took the gun
[1:40:09] they didn't tell them to kill but there
[1:40:11] is a sub domino message in the music
[1:40:16] and when he went to the church he
[1:40:19] started he told me he said joseph
[1:40:21] when i come to the church i feel i have
[1:40:23] to i have to with the
[1:40:24] children you understand so he
[1:40:27] until he fall this first time he woke up
[1:40:30] he called his wife i love that brother
[1:40:32] because
[1:40:33] when he falls straight away call his
[1:40:35] wife he called that
[1:40:37] i did wrong forgive me my that's a
[1:40:40] christian
[1:40:41] some people they don't do that when they
[1:40:42] say you see
[1:40:44] they want to say you see dude seven
[1:40:46] times i don't know 10 he never confessed
[1:40:48] he's keeping
[1:40:49] hypocrite call your wife and confess
[1:40:52] that to the right way of confessed
[1:40:54] sin of adultery and you can pick up
[1:40:58] there is no is a champion of life there
[1:41:00] is no one when you fall that's the
[1:41:02] problem christianity
[1:41:03] it's he asked a christian and the
[1:41:04] christian is within the holy spirit
[1:41:07] when you make a mistake even if he's a
[1:41:08] child you have ability to say oh joy
[1:41:11] forgive me i didn't mean that you know

[1:45:53] more demons
[1:45:54] if you bring something in the church
[1:45:56] cloud
[1:45:57] [Music]
[1:46:10] hallelujah
[1:46:24] the same code brother brother lord for
[1:46:27] my side
[1:46:29] he was going home that morning about
[1:46:32] five o'clock
[1:46:34] been driven by i believe it was his son
[1:46:39] an old model a car going up
[1:46:42] the road and it was sitting in their
[1:46:45] back
[1:46:46] seat saying praise the lord for my sight
[1:46:50] his eyes come up come open just about
[1:46:54] the whole country and so he ran into the
[1:46:58] catholic church
[1:46:59] the morning which he had on the end of
[1:47:02] his game
[1:47:03] dwelling in around like this praising
[1:47:06] god
[1:47:06] for giving his side and when he went
[1:47:08] over in the methodist church hallelujah
[1:47:10] catholic
[1:47:11] to the middle east i love this and he
[1:47:13] was going
[1:47:14] to have him harvested i don't i don't
[1:47:17] care if you arrest me or not
[1:47:18] disturbing hallelujah the worship don't
[1:47:21] look like
[1:47:22] that would disturb anything but but it
[1:47:25] all
[1:47:25] clap the hand for the lord
[1:47:27] [Applause]
[1:47:33] the healing was there but
[1:47:37] the procedure was not right
[1:47:40] of the one who believed
[1:47:44] they told him to believe he didn't see
[1:47:48] and he came back you told me i'm going
[1:47:51] to believe
[1:47:52] when i said you believe me yes then
[1:47:56] just go and praise god there is a
[1:47:59] attitude
[1:48:01] attitude work a lot even for your pastor
[1:48:05] you can tell him pastor pray for me
[1:48:10] if you don't believe in him
[1:48:13] it won't help you that's the problem i
[1:48:16] want emphasizing
[1:48:18] believe in the men that's the difficult
[1:48:20] time we're living
[1:48:21] because people they don't believe easily
[1:48:24] in the man
[1:48:25] to seek god they want to believe in the
[1:48:28] snakes
[1:48:30] in the sun when god can't
[1:48:33] use the sun can't use the snake god use
[1:48:36] human being that's why you have to pray
[1:48:41] to to know to whom put your confidence
[1:48:45] i'm balancing you can't believe anyone
[1:48:48] in there anyhow
[1:48:49] with your child of god god will always
[1:48:52] help you to break through
[1:48:54] god will always help you to believe a
[1:48:57] right person
[1:48:58] if your attitude is good i always tell
[1:49:01] people
[1:49:02] sisters and brothers not get married
[1:49:04] until
[1:49:05] you remove your fashion of your wife or
[1:49:08] your husband you have in your mind
[1:49:10] if you want a husband that knows like
[1:49:12] joseph
[1:49:13] and they thought you would never have
[1:49:14] because i'm alone there is no another
[1:49:16] joseph
[1:49:17] you must say if someone you don't know
[1:49:19] hallelujah

[1:54:40] attitude today good things all only
[1:54:41] preachers
[1:54:42] only yes we are under effect where
[1:54:45] you're servant
[1:54:46] you don't know that we're just we are
[1:54:48] saving you you are the boss
[1:54:50] sitting hello glory to god
[1:54:53] there is another way when this body
[1:54:55] wants to feel pride you break it down
[1:54:57] you are saving
[1:54:57] them god send you with a blood you know
[1:55:00] in the body
[1:55:01] i don't know in the fist who saved a
[1:55:03] servant you were sitting
[1:55:05] they invite you we are giving food
[1:55:07] that's another side of this
[1:55:09] there's nothing good but the one who
[1:55:11] give food is god
[1:55:12] i'm just a saving and when he's saving
[1:55:14] you just surrender me using you blessed
[1:55:17] when i feel like i'm doing it you will
[1:55:19] never will be sleeping
[1:55:21] good then for the lord praise god
[1:55:27] human being always stuck on the flesh
[1:55:31] always i give a simple example
[1:55:34] isaac want to get married abraham send
[1:55:37] eliezer
[1:55:38] elisa when rebecca
[1:55:42] are you going yes and eliezer start to
[1:55:45] explain
[1:55:47] who is isaac look like
[1:55:52] what he likes an evening always come up
[1:55:57] in the yard it's why and
[1:56:01] rebecca start every image of isaac
[1:56:06] and they carry eyes rebecca closer to
[1:56:10] isaac
[1:56:12] and who is that that question was
[1:56:15] he look like the one you told me oh yeah
[1:56:20] that's the same of the message our
[1:56:23] eliezer is
[1:56:24] brother brannam i can give you a quote
[1:56:27] if you want he said
[1:56:29] send me as a liaison to go and look for
[1:56:33] your rebeccas
[1:56:35] so there is a time you work for brother
[1:56:37] branham
[1:56:39] and the only one time brother branham
[1:56:41] said i saw the pillow fire
[1:56:43] alarmed it it left me to wet me from the
[1:56:46] tent
[1:56:47] you see the time where you must leave a
[1:56:50] brother branham
[1:56:51] to marry christ in the tank hallelujah
[1:56:56] that's the mystery of the message and
[1:56:59] when
[1:56:59] you marry christ you understand the
[1:57:02] bearer bran nam
[1:57:05] but when you want to leave abraham
[1:57:07] before you meet christ you
[1:57:08] lost that's the problem you lost
[1:57:12] people they fear they are nowhere
[1:57:16] and the people they took too much they
[1:57:18] are no way
[1:57:19] but the bride stay with the message and
[1:57:22] the messenger
[1:57:24] until they met him in the small tent
[1:57:27] and when you enter in that tent but
[1:57:30] abraham says i saw the third pool
[1:57:32] our message is indefinable that's why
[1:57:35] there is a
[1:57:36] power you can't explain it
[1:57:39] your mind your spirit
[1:57:43] your body we never understand
[1:57:46] and nona language is not even if angel
[1:57:50] language
[1:57:50] do you understand that even if the angel
[1:57:54] they don't know
[1:57:55] it angels are your workers
[1:57:59] you you always want to see angels they
[1:58:01] are your worker you are more than an
[1:58:03] angel you know good and you know wrong
[1:58:06] the angel will always be there nothing
[1:58:08] tempts them but you you know the devil
[1:58:11] he can come to you say hey you i was
[1:58:14] with god when we created you
[1:58:16] you have experience over six years but
[1:58:18] me i've experienced a fraternity
[1:58:20] for the lord
[1:58:26] that's why the language the vocabularies
[1:58:28] this is a
[1:58:30] certain version of seven times as a
[1:58:31] series people they don't understand
[1:58:32] because they want to understand
[1:58:34] if the memories the mind will you will
[1:58:36] never
[1:58:37] understand and when you understand it
[1:58:39] you just become
[1:58:40] humble because there is no language
[1:58:43] is an unknown language
[1:58:47] you become humble you love more god than
[1:58:50] before
[1:58:51] you you you can't explain but it's a
[1:58:54] real
[1:58:55] because there is a message in the
[1:58:58] message
[1:59:00] i repeat again there is a message in the
[1:59:04] message
[1:59:04] there is a first message it brought all
[1:59:07] this
[1:59:07] nonsense you put the net in the river
[1:59:12] it brings a separate it brings cargo
[1:59:15] but when you put in the show ground you
[1:59:18] choose a fish
[1:59:19] so why you mind for those of us pencil
[1:59:22] and
[1:59:22] cloud the internet criticize the cloud
[1:59:26] when bada barami said you see the nose
[1:59:28] you see the eyes
[1:59:30] is there your husband and they said it
[1:59:32] wasn't it was a smoke
[1:59:34] and you are there try to analyze what's
[1:59:37] wrong with you you are just private
[1:59:40] yourself for the blessing
[1:59:42] christ came to deliver you in a higher
[1:59:46] the revelation of seven thunders is a
[1:59:48] rio then when the seventies is a real
[1:59:51] you just surrender yourself in the lord
[1:59:58] that's my power deadpool one day by one
[2:00:01] of them said
[2:00:03] i fell i wanna pray for this i love this

[2:15:17] testimony was he's going through
[2:15:19] he's more than what you going through
[2:15:21] maybe
[2:15:23] he doesn't want to say it you just trust
[2:15:25] in the lord
[2:15:27] so sometimes it takes some
[2:15:30] just to fellowship encouragement you
[2:15:32] feel released sometimes even if the word
[2:15:34] the people
[2:15:35] you know ask are you all right yeah it's
[2:15:37] working shop yeah i'm fine
[2:15:39] thank you for asking it's they release
[2:15:41] pressure
[2:15:43] that's why communion sometimes is good
[2:15:47] communion if you feel like just two
[2:15:48] three questions
[2:15:50] sometimes it's okay because you are
[2:15:51] living in the pressure there is a cloud
[2:15:54] darkness it's corrupted that's why
[2:15:56] babanami used to like to go and pray in
[2:15:58] the bush
[2:15:59] because atmospherity is a little bit
[2:16:01] good done in the town
[2:16:03] spirits it's a fight
[2:16:07] that's why when you have to come to
[2:16:08] church come to church sister brother
[2:16:12] yeah let us sing let us get you loose
[2:16:14] let us clap the hand
[2:16:16] let us sing why because this body we

[2:16:50] blessing i'm telling you don't wait to
[2:16:53] feel
[2:16:54] like no ways when you don't feel like
[2:16:58] do it do it
[2:17:01] and when you pray there is a blessing
[2:17:04] praise
[2:17:05] god god is a spirit
[2:17:09] the true worshipers must worship him in
[2:17:11] the truth
[2:17:12] and in the spirit
[2:17:16] then god uses people always
[2:17:19] use people so when god is using people

[2:19:26] wednesday it's like i was struggling now
[2:19:28] i don't struggle
[2:19:30] i want to read you pull me that way just
[2:19:32] to make our pasta tired please
[2:19:34] pull a little bit oh yeah cleveland for
[2:19:36] the lord
[2:19:37] praise god you're using the gift
[2:19:40] that's true and you make the preacher
[2:19:42] tired the veg is going out
[2:19:45] okay now as i pray for the sick
[2:19:49] i want each one of you out to be
[2:19:52] to be aware of this that the holy spirit
[2:19:54] is right out over this audience
[2:19:56] tonight to heal anybody that's in the
[2:19:59] audience
[2:20:00] now this may be a little different from
[2:20:03] that
[2:20:03] you see of brethren pray for the sick
[2:20:07] i can only do as god tells me to do
[2:20:10] i can only say as he says for me
[2:20:14] to do and if i tell the truth then god
[2:20:17] will testify
[2:20:18] that after the truth now
[2:20:21] what i am afraid of is this dear friend
[2:20:26] what i'm afraid of as it was
[2:20:29] back there it have to be that way
[2:20:32] because when our mass when moses
[2:20:36] came many refused moses because he was a
[2:20:39] man
[2:20:40] when jesus came men many
[2:20:44] of them refused jesus because he was a
[2:20:46] man
[2:20:47] said him being a man make himself equal
[2:20:50] with god
[2:20:51] now it was god manifested in the flesh
[2:20:55] so there is there will be ordained
[2:20:59] certain things to be
[2:21:00] done and then it's so hard sometimes
[2:21:03] for people to see that because a man
[2:21:06] said so
[2:21:07] he said i'll do a work in the last days
[2:21:11] though a man bring it they will not
[2:21:14] believe it
[2:21:15] that's right that's the spiritual how
[2:21:17] many knows that's
[2:21:19] scripture he do though a man will bring
[2:21:22] it speak it now
[2:21:23] it's hard the hardest things that god
[2:21:26] ever
[2:21:27] gotten to to do all
[2:21:30] had to do was to get one motto
[2:21:34] to believe another you believe
[2:21:37] anything almost but a one person
[2:21:40] believing another that's a hard thing
[2:21:44] and i i've just thought this for years
[2:21:47] i've
[2:21:48] tried ever since i've been out to stand
[2:21:52] back and try to keep out of
[2:21:55] the picture just as much as i
[2:21:58] probably could so they would see the
[2:22:01] lord
[2:22:02] jesus see stand back
[2:22:05] and i want you now to look to what i'm
[2:22:08] pointing to not because i'm telling you
[2:22:12] this
[2:22:12] that the angel of the lord how many see
[2:22:15] the picture
[2:22:17] of its back there at the counter
[2:22:21] let's see your you should see it i wish
[2:22:24] i could afford
[2:22:25] to get them and give them everyone to
[2:22:28] you
[2:22:28] just about cost us what we got on there
[2:22:32] and they will be glad if you can get it
[2:22:35] we just a very few
[2:22:36] of them left that we have explained
[2:22:39] about the
[2:22:40] angel the pill of fire you know even if
[2:22:43] abraham was
[2:22:44] struggling for people
[2:22:47] not to see him to point them to christ
[2:22:52] that's that's the hardest because
[2:22:56] you have first to see god
[2:23:00] in the man and they can come to you
[2:23:05] so we have a malachi 4 we've got
[2:23:09] all our boxes it's a box of if
[2:23:11] everything
[2:23:12] when we open there is healing there is
[2:23:15] eternal life
[2:23:16] that everything is there but the one who
[2:23:18] brought malakai for
[2:23:19] is the angel the one who preached
[2:23:21] malachi 4
[2:23:22] is the angel but the brahm is the vessel
[2:23:25] god
[2:23:26] uses that's why he always said if i can
[2:23:29] succeed to get out of my picture to get
[2:23:32] out
[2:23:32] he can step in then you can see jesus
[2:23:35] i've tried to pull to him
[2:23:39] and he said god if you
[2:23:42] bring the people to believe you you see
[2:23:45] how tricky things
[2:23:46] are if you bring the people to believe
[2:23:49] you
[2:23:49] even a cancer even if healing
[2:23:52] it's it's to you to believe a man
[2:23:56] you to see god in the man then
[2:23:59] that's why worship must have a
[2:24:02] revelation
[2:24:04] you can't worship without revelation
[2:24:07] those people they start a church
[2:24:09] without revelation they're baptizing in
[2:24:11] the father son holy spirit
[2:24:13] because jesus said so but when we have a
[2:24:16] revelation
[2:24:18] the revelation of a father son of the
[2:24:19] spirit is the lord jesus christ
[2:24:22] is a revelation the message are revealed
[2:24:25] for the age
[2:24:26] but you need a personal revelation
[2:24:29] to be connected to that link
[2:24:32] and when eliezer is brought into christ
[2:24:35] when you match christ you must be able
[2:24:39] to left
[2:24:40] branham out you marry the lord jesus
[2:24:43] christ
[2:24:44] clear then for the lord
[2:24:48] that's the formula you can't kick him
[2:24:51] out you can't
[2:24:52] take him in the bedroom the bedroom is a
[2:24:54] husband
[2:24:55] and wife is abide by a bright groomer
[2:24:58] and when you marry christ you will never
[2:25:01] forget about the jesus
[2:25:02] because he show you christ and when you
[2:25:04] have a confusion
[2:25:06] you just believe what eliezer told you
[2:25:08] to believe
[2:25:09] you don't need to explain when he said
[2:25:11] they said
[2:25:12] he's revealed you don't need to explain
[2:25:15] you have a healing believe
[2:25:16] you don't have it explained you are a
[2:25:18] bride of christ to believe
[2:25:20] you don't even explain it the cloud is
[2:25:22] the christ the believer
[2:25:24] you don't need to explain everything is
[2:25:26] with
[2:25:27] its ability revered we have the prophet
[2:25:30] even the camp
[2:25:31] we have a pill of fire in the camp that
[2:25:33] god of malachi 4
[2:25:35] he must be allowed here we must have a
[2:25:37] healing
[2:25:38] we must have a solution we must have a
[2:25:40] transformation
[2:25:41] we must have god of william branham
[2:25:44] to heal us to bless us to give you what
[2:25:47] we want
[2:25:48] we more than conquer us the greater than
