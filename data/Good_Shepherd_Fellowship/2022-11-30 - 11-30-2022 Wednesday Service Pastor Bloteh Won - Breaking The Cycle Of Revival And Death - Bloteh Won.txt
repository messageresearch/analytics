on my heart that I would like to speak on tonight so before we go into the subject let's stand on our feet and then we will we can read a portion of the word and then I will be able to go into the testimony that I want to share with you tonight thank you musicians thank you I will read from Genesis chapter 30. Genesis chapter 30. a read from Genesis chapter 30. getting Genesis Chapter 30 let's read verse 1 Genesis Chapter 30 let's read verse 1. and when Rachel saw that she beared Jacob no children Rachel Envy her sister and and said unto Jacob give me children OS I die let us pray heavenly father almighty God we so grateful Lord Jesus to have this opportunity on a Wednesday night Lord to come together

the preaching of the word but we just want to bring a little uh testimony the word of hesitation to your people and believing that God you will bless it tonight you are anointed father and it will give us a reason to go before you in praying tonight so we ask that God take complete control now father All to You Lord Jesus we submit ourselves come and speak through us now in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord amen just like I said before while many uh their uh you know people that are very good in uh in uh making a good you know summary of the travel every time they do that and I'm not I'm not very well caught that way praise the Lord but uh what what I want to bring tonight is now actually from the trip and uh but there was one thing that took place on the trip that uh there for a long time uh didn't Witness uh we we were ministering on Sunday uh for brother tizora he's he's in another city I should have gone for his song wedding he wanted me to come and help him officially his son wedding and pray for them but I couldn't go at the time he wanted to so when this brother asked that we come and do his meeting then I asked the brother if if he will allow me to to be able to take one service for brother to Zora so it works out that um you know we could do that so we were there ministering for them on Sunday we had a we had a good we had a good service the Lord blessed the service and uh uh and then when we came you know we came to uh to the end of the service I mean uh it was it was almost like a like an outpouring I was actually speaking that night on the cycle of Revival and death I have spoken on it here but uh I was talking actually on in in another sense of breaking the cycle you know because uh we know that uh and and sometimes some of these things can be it can be amazing in a way that the Lord you know actually actually can move now I use this code uh at the time that we spoke about it this was the very same code that I use but something caught my attention while I was preaching that morning uh is from the Ephesian Church age I've just just follow me and I didn't I didn't say my not there but I mean if if they have it they can be able to project it but uh where Branham says that cycle of Revival and death has never failed the cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is recall this last move of God in the spirit when men and women dress like Christian went to church pray all night talk to the street Conan and wearing a shame of the manifestation of the spirit now when brother Branham said all we have to do is to recall the last move of God he was pointing to Pentecost amen he was pointing to Pentecost he was pointing to the effect of Azusa praise the Lord now I I never caught that at the time I I preached that year but uh uh I think maybe it was it was maybe the the inspiration I was honored but but let's let's read a little bit he says if you have all you have to do is to recall the last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christian went to church pray all night took to the street columns and we're in a shame of the manifestation of the spirit they left their old their churches and worshiped in homes or all store building they they hire reality but it wasn't too long a time until they begin to get enough money to build fine new churches praise the Lord uh they put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves they put gowns on the choir they organized a movement and Reign it by men amen the different organization in the church they soon begin to rebooks that were in fact to read they let down the bar and goats came in and took over The Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with a form above the fire had died down and the Blackness of arches is about all that is left praise the Lord now so uh uh like I said speaking on this year that I never and it never come to my mind but what I was what the burden that I had on my heart when I was I was preaching this uh on Sunday was uh breaking out of the Revival of psycho I mean the cycle of Revival and death so almost like breaking the cycle praise the Lord amen so uh uh [Music] Let's uh let's go to the book of of Trinity this is this is now where we we uh taught that we will speak from for tonight but uh let's let's just uh praise the Lord let's go to the book of Trinity let's read second Timothy chapter 2 verse 10. that's that's something that we have there with here before but just to see how the Lord was able to help us when we were away second Timothy let's read from verse 7 second Timothy chapter one verse 7 for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of some mind be be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord none of mean his praising above be thou partaker of the of the afflictions of the Gospel I calling to the power of God who have saved us and call us with and holy calling not according to our works but I call into his purpose and Grace which was giving us in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the word praise the Lord now so reading on this verse we we we went back a little bit and saw how Israel sprung Grace in Exodus chapter 19 we spoke on that year too all that the Lord have spoken we will do or that the Lord have said we will do that was a filter mistake that Israel made we we we we touch on that a little bit so then that brought me to this subject realizing that uh uh he will have saved us he have called us to a holy calling not according to our works but I call into his purpose in his grace which was giving us in Christ Jesus before the word begin praise the Lord but it's now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who have abolished death now so that's where my inspiration was coming from when I was talking on the cycle of Revival and death there is a time where death was abolished praise the Lord so if every Revival had a psych if every age had a cycle of Revival and death there there must be a time where that cycle must be broken praise the Lord so what I was showing uh uh or I was I was laboring on them preaching was that um we look at the first Revival we look at every Revival and how they went and in a time of Revival and uh and then they came to a time of lukewarmness and actually they came to a time to organize and now we we look at the church ages but then we realize there is a reason why uh uh uh um there's a reason why the message has called us out of denomination praise the Lord the calling of the Bride is the breaking of the cycle praise the Lord now if it is the breaking of the cycle then this revival is not going to die why because the message will not be denominated praise the Lord amen churches are going to die people around the message are going to die but the message this revival amen this revival is the breaking of the cycle are we together amen now so what I did was that um uh I I I I use this I use this that Paul is talking about here how uh how the appearing of our Lord Jesus who has abolished death and have broad life and immortality to light through the gospel praise the Lord amen so just like how death took uh uh uh Moses and death took Samson and death took all the Great Men Through the Ages praise the Lord but when it came when death met our Lord Jesus amen he conquered there praise the Lord he took the stain out of death amen and naturally what he did was he brought immortality praise the Lord Hallelujah in a sense that he resurrected amen and then uh uh uh he stepped into uh uh uh uh a glorified body praise the Lord that's what saint Luke chapter 24 show us uh uh he got into a Celestial body when he resurrected a bother that he could be identified praise the Lord and and and Merit identified him he says don't touch me I have not ascended yet but then after he ascended and uh and and and presented himself he also came uh into a glorified body and he walked with the man on the road of of Empires and he went down and and then uh the big bread and and and and you know he has supper with them and and uh uh pretty soon uh uh they saw him and the Bible says he finally she took off why the disciples were gathered together he came into their mess he never needed a key praise the Lord so Paul now is trying to make us to see something year that uh uh uh uh bar the appearing by the coming of our Lord Jesus what uh uh uh uh Christ brought us and what was demonstrated in his ministry then in his life was very very important now so I point out to the Saints to make them to for us to realize that's the reason why in this age God gave us an Evidence of a life behind the curtain of time good praise the Lord amen there are many many men has uh has half trans people have had uh uh uh they have had uh after death uh storied in uh you know died and traveled to heaven and you know in in all the different things that uh you know people have had whether it was dream or whether you know it was leaving their body trance and all of that but you will see that uh you know it was it was very important in our age like like even the Apostle Paul he he he he had to he says what I was in this body of out of this body I cannot tell praise the Lord but he he visited the tear heavens and there were things that he could not explain he I mean he could not talk about now you see but uh all of those men through all the ages that the hardest experience who have not had this who have not had that experience except our Lord Jesus Christ rented the Veil amen he rented the bill he abolished death for the Believers so for us death do not exist is just a transportation praise the Lord and not only that but he also brought immortality to light amen now because he could leave those uh uh disciples on the road of in Myers vanish out of the aside before you realize he's entering the other meeting because he could do that Philip could do the same praise the Lord Philip could do the same Philip left a Revival in Samira and the Bible said he was he was taking he was transported to go and meet the Ethiopian eunuch traveling on the Run what was that it was immortality praise the Lord are we together now so uh uh uh but what we were we were working on we were laboring on with the Saints was to show that how the the the cycle of Revival and death it hit every Church age it hit every Church age God would take the people through a Revival you know like just like brother Branham says you know uh uh they're dressed like Christian they live like Christian they pray all night and everything and then after a while they were organized and and and and the Revival fire would go away from them praise the Lord every every age went through that praise the Lord but the reason why God sent a prophet the reason why the seals were open like like like we read that code but Abraham says uh that the man of Christ is in the bride she knows what to do with the word praise the Lord amen and then we also spoke I'm coming back to my to my to my testimony we also talk about uh I use a a code there from uh how can I overcome you know showing the church is not what to overcome but how to overcome now so brother Branham says overcoming means keeping alive and so I was I was telling the church I said that's how this bride that's how this bride is going to break the cycle of death praise the Lord because you have to realize brother Branham says you know what uh he says when you see the the the the ocean it gets is getting rough and and you know is is bubbling in itself when the ocean is having Revival he says all it's doing is just pausing itself it's trying to get all the trash away the water in the ocean does not increase their waves get rough it goes up it goes up and down all it's trying to do is just to it's just to push itself clean itself of all of the trash put it on the shore he says that's what Revival is to the church that's what Revival is every time we take inventory of our life every time the grace of God help us to identify things in our life and why is it far so we can keep it alive praise the Lord so we can keep alive so you see uh uh people uh uh look for the the the the the uh what how can I call it that the the the the the emotion the the the the manifestation the airplane manifestation and all of that oh you know why it will be a Revival if we get back on the street corner it will be everybody all of those things are wonderful praise the Lord and we can do all of those things and we can stay go flat but for this bride she's going to keep the word alive in her heart no matter what we go through the the different phases of doctrines that have swept through the message that different men that has raised up with name and call themselves eight messenger they have all come and gone but the brightest stay here praise the Lord amen this bride is called out to break from the cycle of Revival and death why because the opening of the seal has abolished death for the bride praise the Lord so that's what we were talking about so it was a little bit uh uh uh on on the end of Breaking the cycle that's what we were we were actually speaking on so we uh uh and and you know and it's just like that you know I mean the Lord blessed the services and it's always a blessing to uh to a pastor in the local church when a visitor comes and then he comes start preaching and he just get right in the midst of what the church has been dealing with like the Bible says what the spirit has been speaking to the church praise the Lord so I think the Holy Ghost was dealing with the people on uh on on setting few things and I think all the all the services were the same and uh and and and right after that I mean we just we just had a such an awesome time and I mean a good atmosphere uh the people went into praying and uh and the Lord just sent a message uh uh uh with one of the sisters that was that is blessed with the gift of tongues and interpretation and it just it just kind of a re-echo everything that Holy Ghost was already dealing with the church with so that was just beautiful it was beautiful and it was also edifying praise the Lord amen it was it was it was also edifying to know that uh you know we we went to label with the with the pastor there what what actually he was dealing with so we had a beautiful time we had a good time praise the Lord amen so uh what what I wanted to share tonight is uh uh I wanted to share a little testimony there there that that caught my mind on what I read from Genesis uh Terry tonight I will get back to that but uh this testimony is about uh a preacher it's about a preacher in in Scotland now he was he was one of uh uh he was one of the men that voted the Titanic when the Titanic sank and uh but uh John Harper is his name now there is there is there is something in uh in his testimony that that Drew that draw my mind today's uh of what I want to share with you before we we go into praying now so he came from a from a very from a very the uh struggling family and uh at the age of 13 you know he gave his heart to the Lord and even even uh from a young age uh you know he's uh his his heart was always burdened to do something for the Lord so he started preaching he started preaching uh uh from a very as a teenager and uh uh he he was also uh uh you know impacted by the the Welsh Revival and uh uh he was he was during that time so uh um John Harper he used to do street preaching you know he was not too much of uh you know a Pulpit guy as a young man he was always out on the street you know trying to testify and and win souls for the Lord now so uh uh he was invited over to to the states okay I'll try to just wrap everything here and get to my point he was invited to the state so come and preach at uh at uh Jewel Moody uh uh Church and uh at a time Modi was not around though but uh the pastor that was pastoring the church invited him and he came as a young man he had he had such a Revival he had I mean yeah such a message and I mean he he just captivated the people and uh you know uh uh uh you know stir the people up and and put the people you know down to praying and all of that so he went back uh to Scotland so because of that meeting that he had I mean he was I think actually he was invite invited for a few days I think it was a week uh but because of the way that the law was blessing him they had service for an entire month which of course it was it was it was very strange to the church I mean the the the meeting just went on and on and on and on so the church was blessed with the with the Revival and then they wanted to have him to come back again praise the Lord now so at a time they were going to have him to come back uh uh the British had a big ship at the time they were uh uh invited him to come back that would have been one of the first time that uh you know the Titanic was going to sell so he was hoping to take his daughter you know on the on the ship ride mind you he lost his wife uh she she passed away from tobacco losses and so he was uh a single father as he would as he was saying but he had a anonymity that was taking care of his little daughter so he told her and that uh I'm gonna take you on uh you know on on the Titanic we go into to the U.S so you know they're all planning and they were getting ready and preparing himself so uh John Harper he was he was known for uh you know a kind of a man a young man that was very inspired and uh he was also known for a very good uh amount of time that he spent with the Lord in prayer but he had a burden on his heart you know uh one of his brother testified that John would go over to the church and he will he will you know he would just lay flat on the ground and start crying to God I mean for him uh every day he wanted to have a soul that he would bring to the kingdom so it was it was a common thing you know that his brother said it was a very common thing you know John we were late and he cried and he would say oh God give me Soul lease I die praise the Lord amen now you can see why I read that scripture Rachel crying to Jacob and say give me children least I die praise the Lord amen now so I will get I will get to the scripture part of it so let me let me just wrap up uh uh John half a testimony yeah so John uh when when it came time for them to go he uh he and his daughter and he took the nanny because he was going to be busy with the meeting so he wanted the Nani to take care of uh uh the girl actually turned out that the nanny was his sister so while as the as they got him got on board you know uh he would use every occasion on the ship you know what to witness to people and talk to people about the Lord but that morning that morning of uh uh a prayer about in April 14 and that was when the the Titanic heart is a horrible experience now that morning uh uh one of the neighbor she wrote uh you know as a Survivor she wrote that testimony how John will call them for the devotion even that very morning John high heart to read the scripture you know and and she read the scripture and uh uh you know and and he encouraged him and he said uh you know after the devotion he says today is going to be a beautiful day he just said it like that he said it's going to be a beautiful day today you know so I mean everyone what this verse you know uh uh to go and get ready for church it was a Sunday morning also they had a chopper on on the Titanic people were going to go to church and all of that so after all of that that and then uh uh you know the ship when it hit the ice so right in that time you know uh uh they started calling for people you know most especially uh uh women and children they were putting them on the Lifeboat and uh and older people and as many people you know there that wanted to to to get off the ship immediately so John took his uh his his sister or the the Nani and and and and his little girl and and took them to the to the Lifeboat now because that was his daughter and his wife was not around you know he was he was also uh uh eligible to get on the on the boat on one of those lifeboats but he took them to safety and uh and and then he he told his uh his his little baby that he was coming back and she was crying you know crying she says no no Daddy you know don't leave me you know don't leave me and then John turned and then he went right back on the boat as much as he was there trying to help the Adelaide in trying to help the the women and the children he was using that time in every meaning to witness to souls on the boat you know I mean as as as he meets people and helping them have you given your life to the Lord Jesus you know are you saved you know do you know the Lord Jesus I mean he was testifying and testifying and witnessing and uh on and on and on and on that uh his his mission on on the Titanic was to lead as many souls to Christ as he you know uh will have not realizing that it was going to cause his life and he stayed on the ship until I mean the shape sank and uh and because there was never uh uh you know any kind of security camera recalling anything so there is not much that is known of uh there are how many people that he led to the Lord but after a couple of years in Canada they were having a reunion of uh of survivors on the Titanic and there was one man that uh decided to give his experience and as he talked about everything that happened the last thing that he remember happened to him he was floating on a little uh uh particle whatever it was from the Titanic he was floating on and and I mean he was he was at the place where he thought he was going to drive and then here come this man right from under the under the water and just uh you know pull himself up and that was John he leaned on the piece of metal with a man and asked the man are you safe very good the man said no and I said do you know the Lord Jesus he said no he says can you will you give you can you give your life to Jesus he says I don't know you know so he said just just ask the Lord Jesus to come into your heart and then he got down under the water again and then after the wide he came up and then he's you know he swam to where the man was again and asked the man are you safe have you accepted the Lord Jesus they may say no he says what are you waiting for you know you could die any moment what are you waiting for you know and then uh you know he he kind of a witnessed to the man and uh uh and and and I mean that was the end of the story for John but the man was talking the rest of the story for himself you know realizing it to him I mean this man is is almost drowning and and asking him to give his life to the Lord Jesus so he just laying on that thinking you know uh uh maybe he was not a Christian I've never heard about the gospel but he leaned on that thing and he just prayed and said Jesus will you come into my heart I mean he just gave his heart to the Lord Jesus and I ever say he testified in many years after as the last convert of John Harper he said I believe that I'm his last comfort and this man was not a a pastor of a Presbyterian Church he says I believe I'm the last convert of John Hopper now so as I was listening to the testimony I was kind of playing some some testimony Series today as I was listening to it the thought of give me soul Lisa died caught my heart and then I started thinking about richer when she told Jacob gave me children at least I die praise the Lord so that's that's just my little inspiration I want to speak on tonight I thought that I would use uh John half a story to kind of official Spirit tonight and then uh uh just take that little little inspiration you know like brother Branham said he said there are many many of the Old Testament uh uh character in The Bible he said that in Christ he's the mission of God revealed he says they were playing our things in their life that they had no idea of praise the Lord now you have to remember there's a there's a prophecy of of Rachel weeping for her children amen we shall cause thou prophecy referred to Israel in some sense and even in uh in the gospel talking about word our lord Jesus was born at a time where hero was killing all the children you know their prophecy also was brought out of richer whipping for her children now so uh I just want to take that little thought tonight because it just kind of a stuck on my mind amen the the the the the the desire for Souls I want us to go over to uh Genesis chapter 15. praise the Lord Genesis chapter 15. are we together here now Genesis chapter 15 you will realize that a there's a conversation here that is going to make God to bring Abraham to a place of coveting where he's going to promise Abraham about let's read there from verse one after these things the word of the Lord came to Abraham in the vision saying fear not Abraham Abraham I am that shade and that exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God what will thy give me seen I go childless and the steward of my house is this early easy of Damascus praise the Lord now here is Abraham the father of faith realize that all my time is gone but I would just I will just drive this thing down before we leave from here tonight here is Abraham the father of Faith now you you see that God gave Abraham a promise that he was going to have a son and through him all Nation will be blessed you'll become the father of all Nations and God carry Abraham all of these years and many years he traveled in all the places we know all the things that happened in the home of Abraham but what I want to show you there is that how almighty God in a way that he designed us as his children his desire and the things that he want to make manifest that's the reason why in every age God have his elected people and just like he told Israel he wanted to make them A peculiar people praise the Lord amen because God's people are peculiar people praise the Lord because we are peculiar because we are here to manifest God's thoughts amen whatever it starts whatever is his pleasure we are the people that the pleasure of the Lord is going to prosper and then God's going to use our life the situation that he will place Us in the family we will be born in and the things that will happen around our life that's the thing that make us peculiar not the way we design ourselves we cut our head and and and you know pin our face that's not what make us peculiar is the design that the way that God has designed our life praise the Lord and the things that he he will fulfill through our life that will make people to see the picture praise the Lord that would make people to see him just like Jesus said let your lies shine that man will see your good work and glorify your father that is in heaven praise the Lord so in many times God will use a second person because he is the first person and he will use a second person to be able to play out certain character just like Joseph you know I was he played our Perfection just like David crying my God my God crying on the mountain and all of that God will always use his children he will place now so see Abraham yeah crying to God see that I go childless amen and this elieza Steven in my house born in my house Abraham saying what you know uh uh uh I'm going to adopt him because I'm going childish now you will see it yeah what I want you to see there is that uh uh this is beyond Abraham amen richer taking uh Jacob by the belt and saying give me children she knows that Jacob is not a creator praise the Lord amen she knows that he he cannot go to the to the grocery store and buy children praise the Lord amen but you realize that at that period of time there is there is uh there is uh uh uh uh an inspiration that came on richer that was expressing God's mind more than richer physical needs praise the Lord and not a picture again you will see uh uh uh uh look at some your mother Hannah amen praise the Lord look at some your mother being desperate she's having this desperate need in her heart I I want a child and she gets down to the temple and say oh God give me a child and I will give him back to you praise the Lord amen now you have to realize that in that very time in that very time the priest is falling apart the priesthood is falling apart Israel is at adjunction amen they are the junction where the dispensation is going to change in Israel for good praise the Lord here is this woman coming to the prayer meeting on Wednesday night and she found her little corner after the priests have said everything he have said maybe talk about John Harper just like I did and he's talking everything but in that woman heart she's having a burden praise the Lord now God is going to take the burden of Hannah and change the course of israelit praise the Lord so you tell me is that Hannah burden or is it God's burden right she was just a second person expressing the desire of the first person Rachel was a second person expressing the desire of the first person praise the Lord amen Abraham also was a second person expressing the desire of the first person praise the Lord Hallelujah amen you have to realize that you are a second person that must be expressing the desire of the first person praise the Lord amen Hallelujah glory be to God bringing Abraham out here giving him this promise the Bible says God speaking to him in a vision I am your great and you're exceeding reward praise the Lord now you think about it he gets there a vision break before him God is speaking to him but he's caught in his mind all the thing that is on Abraham's mind is that I'm trying foreign praise the Lord the Lord is saying I am your great and your exceeding reward what does that means it means that there is nothing you can lack God is telling him I'm your fountain I'm your Fountain of Life but he's stuck in his need thinking that is his need no it's not his need praise the Lord amen keep me trying at least I died give me so least I die praise the Lord that's what I wanted to bring you tonight that's that was what was on my mind that's the place I want to bring you tonight before we go to the Lord in praying praise the Lord realizing that just like how the Old Testament characters were so also we are praise the Lord amen but what's happening most of the time we we are just we are we are caught in our knee we think that all we need is so much praise the Lord Hannah being a woman her husband was you know giving her all the gifts the Bible says he loved her amen but there was a burden in her heart so I said well it's not money that I want it's now it's not dresses I want well actually I want I want to try and she was just thinking that she just wanted a child just to be a mother like every other mother praise the Lord but see but see there left for time that she spent with Samir so who actually was giving her that burden praise the Lord and that better Brandon would let us to know yet is the other that's the burden that is going away from the church the burden for Souls amen that's the first person desire and he says he don't have no other hands but our hands we don't have no other Faith but our feet you don't have no other mouth that he can be able to talk to to a stranger but but your mouth praise the Lord when one saw the value of one's soul is more than ten thousand words like brother Branham said the value of one soul and yet we go every day not Desiring praise the Lord what I want us to do tonight as we go to pray is to take our heart before the Lord and check for the burden of Souls praise the Lord to look for the burden of Souls praise the Lord do you have the burden of Soul do you think about it do you think about someone being safe do you really feel it is there someone on your heart that you are praying for put yourself in all of those situations Abraham having all of these Visions God visiting him but yet he's caught in that desire nothing will satisfy Hannah nothing was satisfied their husband is giving her all the best gift nothing will satisfy her she caught in that desire it's so much that she don't even care what Eli says one of the things she's drunk what are the things that she's losing her mind she's consumed it's it's a burden on her heart praise the Lord but her desire to have a time will change the course of the history of Israel praise the Lord or desire John Harford was invited for Harper was invited to come and have a Revival glory be to God what if you spend all the time sleeping at least he knew that that would have been his Revival the Titanic would have been his last mission field and the reason why he could do that is because he was living every day with the burden of Lost Souls when you are living conscious every day with the burden of lost souls you don't need a necktie to witness you don't need a Bible honor your arm to witness praise the Lord amen the reason why he could do that is because it was his everyday crying God give me sword at least I died let's go to the Lord in prayer musicians you can come up that's my testimony tonight we will trust the Lord and continue on that thought but I'm hoping I'm praying that God will stir our hearts praise the Lord that God will stirred our heart that where the brothers sisters wife husband children can you imagine if we have a church where the people hearts are burden for Souls what what our hearts our desires are burden for Souls the same way we are studying to have a career we are working to have money we will also want to have a soul to our name [Music] living with that in your mind living with that being conscious of that every day [Music] you don't have to live a religious life your burden becomes your life because you are living with death Lord I want one more soul

which distance they are looking looking at you you don't know whose life you are influencing when you are there's a difference when you're trying to impress people [Music] it's completely different than when you are influencing people when you are influencing people you are not conscious of it you are not conscious of it you are not trying to show up yet and show up there you are just living the best Earnest life because you want to be a witness [Music] you want to be a witness and say Lord May life don't leave my body [Music] don't tell you can use me to bring one soul to you [Music] foreign
