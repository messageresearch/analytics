and we trust you we commit the service into your hands of everything that will be said and done in Jesus name amen amen amen amen I greet you all in the precious name the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's good to be found in the house of the Lord to give him praise Glory and Honor amen hallelujah let's turn to our Bibles amen praise the Lord Matthew chapter 24 verse 35 amen Matthew chapter 24 and: 35 reads Heaven and Earth shall pass pass away but my words shall not pass away amen amen Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away amen why will it not pass away amen because a man is only as good as his word amen if you can't believe a man's word then it's no good so when the word of God Is Spoken it becomes law it becomes God himself in word form amen that's what the Bible says the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us amen hallelujah so we believe the word of God Amen with all our hearts Heaven and Earth will pass away yes amen and then let's turn to Luke 10 verse 42 so this is giving the story about Mary and Martha and you know they were in the house and how Martha was interested in serving the lord Jesus so she was interested in serving the word amen she wanted to see what she can do for the word yes amen but here Lord Jesus says but one thing is needed needful and Mary had chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her amen so Mary chose the word amen hallelujah amen amen you may be seated praise the Lord amen amen for little title we call it the best investment amen amen the best investment amen the best investment we can make in this life that's what we are looking at amen we can we can talk about many things in this life we can try and give one another advice about what is good investments in this life but the best investment we can make is the word of God amen amen so we read the scripture Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words shall not pass away and we know that the first Bible the first word was written in the heavens so God is saying even that will pass away some people dedicate their lives they invest in the study of animals in the study of the moon and the stars they invest the entire being into studying those things but the Bible says what does he profit a man if he gain the whole world and he lose his soul so the best investment is what we are looking at amen I want to tell you at the outset if you have made a wrong investment it's time to pull out your investment and reinvest amen amen amen while you can't reinvest amen amen it's time to reinvest so we see we're living in a time where the thing needed is perfect Faith amen we can't move on without perfect Faith amen we'll die in Latos without perfect Faith that's why the message of the hour came Amen to equip us and to give us perfect Faith amen the prophet says we need to get the church into Apostolic times again amen where we see the move of God in the church amen and he says we want to see more of it amen he says we want it to flow to a point where it can help others how many if you know Jesus said amen the prophet is teaching us the gift is not given for ourselves the anointing is not given for ourselves amen it's for the work of the ministry amen hallelujah we can't live selfish lives and just enjoy the blessings and the anointing and the Revelation upon Revelation and not be concerned for the Lost Jesus first message was repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and his disciples amen we in the last day must amen Echo that message the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand amen hallelujah hallelujah amen so we said the thing needed is faith and not just any ordinary Faith amen but perfect Faith amen hallelujah perfect faith in this hour a rapturing faith why do we need perfect Faith to change these old bodies amen amen hallelujah God didn't say don't worry just go along living a good old church life and one day I come and I'll change your body God is requiring amen a faith part from us and we know that Faith cometh by the hearing of the word so that's why the best in investment is the word amen every investment must give off a return hallelujah amen so one of the returns we are getting of hearing the word is Faith being generated Faith being produced you can listen amen hallelujah to latan church preachers and they'll only raise your level up to a certain Faith amen but if you come under subjection of Revelation 10:7 and Malachi 4:5 and the five form Ministry that's associated with that Ministry you are going to be built up in perfect Faith hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord amen so we see there's a sequence of events we've got to establish our investment in the word of God when we establish our investment in the word of God we are getting Faith yes than you Lord amen hallelujah amen and the Bible says that Faith worketh patience so we're getting patience amen God is equipping his people amen but that's not the only thing what did he say at the last Church age Amen to you that overcome and now if you know that faith is the victory that overcometh this world the only way we are going to overcome this world and this latest and condition is by faith hallah

his pyramid schemes but God has got an eternal City amen amen some people love animals amen the best animal they love is horses cuz they like to invest their money in horses amen the Bible says some trust in horses some trust in chariots but we will trust in the name of our God amen amen some people are going to be miserable in heaven because there's going to be no soccer teams there there's not

faith eyes amen you don't have more zeros but you can add any other number don't add it to the back add it to the front amen how many numbers do you want to add amen hallelujah maybe you're renting in a basement amen maybe amen you're out in the streets amen wherever you may be amen Faith looks Through The Eyes Of God Amen Faith looks through the word of God and he sees himself living in a mansion he sees himself his situation changed come on I'm talking about faith amen faith is the evidence of Things Not Seen the only thing you have is your faith hallelujah amen praise the Lord I know what I'm talking about even before I was in the current position I am in now I used to tell everyone in the office that this is the position I'm going to be they thought I was mad they thought I was not qualified for the position they thought I will never get it amen but my word spoken amen well did not return void yes amen I saw myself in that position and I spoke it amen and then it began to materialize what was my evidence [Music] Faith sometimes you've got to put a fleece to God Amen sometimes amen you got to put amen show God you mean business amen I wasn't playing around it was

resigning in December but God started to change situations am God started to change situations around amen people started to resign positions became available why taking God at his word amen yes amen seeing through eyes of Faith seeing yourself in the position you already are once amen not seeing where you are but looking a far off amen amen I press towards the mark of the eye calling which is in Jesus Christ I see myself as a perfect man I see myself as a Rapture man I see myself as a stature of a perfect man don't look at me in my carnality and faults and failures now Don't Judge Me by those things I'm Looking Through The Eyes of faith and relying on the word of God the word of God said I will become those things amen and I'm relying on what the word says about me amen yes amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen Romans 10:8 says amen the word is NY where's the word the word is n thee even in thy mouth hallelujah hallelujah where was the word finally given and where did John put it the John put it amen At His Feet the John put it on his head amen where did he put it he put it in his mouth amen hallelujah you are what you eat so the word that he began to to eat begin to speak amen let me tell you what John's prophecy sounds like amen you say can you tell me what John's prophecy sounds like yes I am the embodiment of John the only one that can tell you what John is prophesying is meah come on now the only one that can tell you about John's prophecy is you because you are John that's asked to prophesy again no denominational Ser Seminary can tell you what John prophesied the only people that can answer that question is you John what are you prophesying amen praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord I like it when he's here amen praise the Lord the word is NY even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is amen the word of faith which we preach amen we are not preaching doctrines of men we are preaching the word of faith if faith is not established in your heart amen through the preaching of the word I might as well pack it up and go home but the word we preach is the word of faith amen yes we have come to make a dead church amen we haven't come to make a church amen of theology amen but this is the Church of the Living God this is The Church on the Move This is a church on fire amen yes amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah anything that the sensus can declare is R of Faith the prophet says amen it becomes a scientific fact so we must believe that this is God's word it must be established that's why from a young age we try and teach the children this is the word of God invest your life in the things of God we start to teach them the Bible stories we start to sing the Sunday school songs we start to sing the scripture Memory verses what are we doing establishing the word of God in their heart that the word of God is true amen amen amen amen thank you you must come to God by the word amen any man that believeth amen any man that comes to God must first believe you must first believe God's word take the word amen how many of you want to take the word take the word all the word eat the word believe what it says believe what the word says about you is Right Amen Let Us deny and forsake everything that is contrary to God's word I don't know if you can commit to that amen I will deny amen every and forsake everything contrary to the word we sing that song you take the whole world but give me Jesus oh Hallelujah I want to remind you again Jesus is not a figment of your imagination amen hallelujah rather than imagine a Jesus in heaven when you are singing that amen you take the whole world but give me Jesus give me the word give me the word give me the word amen if we have confidence in this word this word will change us yes amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord yes praise the Lord amen amen why do we have such confidence in the word of God God has proven Amen in his word that he will never do anything contrary to his written word so if it is in the written word if it's a promise in the word I can rest my life amen I can rest everything on the written word that it must come to pass the Bible says amen that by the stripes of Jesus we were healed 1 Peter 2:24 by the stripes of Jesus we were healed amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord praise the Lord the Bible says we were blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I rest on that the Bible says we predestinated from before the foundation of the world and to adoption of children I rest on that amen amen God does nothing contrary to his written word amen if it's contrary to the word how can we have faith if we can't put our hopes on this word we can't put our faith in this word amen where where is our faith going to rest Faith must find a resting place oh you know all of these phrases amen the prophet has been preaching these things amen Faith must find a resting place and Faith Finds Its resting place in the word of God Amen praise the Lord amen you know if you read the Bible it tells you about this woman with genuine Faith the prophet says look at that little woman with the blood issue what did she say now here's a woman if you read the the story the Lord is honoring a call from Jus a Mark 16 call if you lay hands upon the sick J says Lord come he's honoring Mark 16 oh Jesus W Jesus will meet you at the point of your faith if you got a Mark 16 Faith honor your faith because it's the word of God people want to start canceling scriptures in the Bible now that they've come to a certain age not that they come to something they say oh no we don't hey be careful that you don't add and you don't subtract hello if it's there in the word it must produce itself what is a seed every seed must bring forth of its kind amen amen so Jesus was honoring a Mark 16 Faith he was on his way to heal jra's daughter and while he's walking there's crowds that are around him he was not even there for that woman yes that's right he wasn't going directly to her amen he was making his way and the the the crowds were around him and all of a sudden Jesus feels virtual leaves his body Jesus turns and he says who touch me and the disciples are even puzzled and they say Lord there are so many people around you what do you mean who touched you some you see many people can touch Jesus they sing touching Jesus is all that matters but their lives are not changed they can touch Jesus you see even sitting in his service like this you are so near to Jesus you can even feel his presence amen but don't leave amen going like one of those people in the crowd having touched him and no virtue left Jesus but there's one woman I don't want you to miss an important point we were speaking on Mark 11:23 a man back in the image of God a man who is able to speak now watch speak to mountains Jesus was telling you what is a mountain he was bringing the most the biggest thing there the biggest obstacle So speaking to Mountain is speaking to your obstacles yes speaking to things that stand in your way what is standing in your way this evening amen what is standing in your way to your Victory the Giants were standing in the way amen of Joshua and Caleb's Victory the giant was standing in the way of David's Victory what did David use David used the word David relied on the word yes you see the sling and the stone was good Dynamics mechanics but watch David as he's marching he starts to speak yes he starts to speak amen amen you defy the armies of the Living God today start to speak the word is in thy mouth amen Joshua don't let the word depart from your mouth am what did Joshua do Joshua didn't go amen into a panic into worry into fear when he saw the sun go down he's a man of Faith he stands there as a God man amen he knew he was connected with the angel of God he had just met the captain of the host he knew his word was backed up so starts to speak amen as he has need he says son you stand still and moon you stand in that Valley he spoke the word thank you Lord when they questioned the woman the woman said this is the woman's confession she started to speak she spoke and said If I Could Touch the M of His Garment I will be made whole she spoke it yes amen amen she got what she spoke speak it and wait there speak it and believe your word speak that you have already received that what you have asked for amen amen praise the Lord the centurion's faith was similar amen what was he speaking about he was giving Jesus a big lecture about faith and how it works yes he was telling Jesus and the Bible says Jesus marveled that this man knew about Authority and the powerful word he had seen it work in caral men he had seen men in our Authority speak a word and our soldiers would give their lives for it yes the authority coming through a man's word am and he knew if there was a greater power and he knew about Jesus Healing The Sick yes and he said if you can do that when he first told him I'll come to your home Jesus said I'll come to your home the word told him I'll come to your home yes hello the word told him I'll come to your home the Centurion said the Gentile Fai said you're I'm not worthy for you to come to my house speak the word in fact he said says speak the word only amen exact words of the Centurion speak the word only don't speak doubt don't speak negativity over your situation speak the word only amall speak the word only am and the Bible says amen his servant was healed the selfs hour you see that was a physical representation of what the power spoken word can do amen it can change the heart of God yes Jesus was even ready to go and make the journey with him but he changed what Jesus told him he would do same like ezekiah wasn't it a prophetic word that came to him get your house in order you're going to die most of us will just accept things amen we get a truth think we think we did amen praise the Lord prepare everything I'm going to die amen praise the Lord I don't think we say things over the I don't think I'll make it not here now not sure we got people of Faith here but generally people start to say things like this in the flesh amen especially if they want to go on a pretty party they don't appreciate me now [Laughter] amen hallelujah praise the Lord so we start to speak things if we don't realize it's having an effect because our words create an atmosphere right you know your doubt and your worry is creating an atmosphere all around you wherever you go you make people anxious amen you know what I'm talking about you know when your boss comes in there how anxious you get they create an atmosphere amen hallelujah praise the Lord what was a woman doing when she was speaking must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free the atmosphere in the house was terrible was a drunk man throwing plates of food violent temper but she started to use the words to change the atmosphere change the atmosphere the situation may look impossible in your life your obstacle your Mountain but use the word of God to change your atmosphere some people are very pessimistic amen you know Jesus teaching about Investments he's teaching about how he was given they were given talents yes they went there some went to invest it but some did nothing with that they didn't invest it so in the same way I don't want to go into that story but you know that some people got the the word of God the talent is given to you yes but they don't invest it yes yes the best investment is to put the word of God in your heart speak it in your mouth best investment it will change your life hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen so the identification of a True Believer what is the identification of a True Believer brother Bram says in perfect faith that Jesus relied in what the word said about him Jesus relied on what the word said about him and he said if he relied on what the word said about him he says can't we rely on what the word says about us if it says amen I want all that the word says about me how many if you want that I want to rely on everything the word says about me this isn't the message perfect Faith now he says can't we rely what the word says about us amen so the identification of a True Believer is one who is able to believe in the word of God and what the word says about him so what is he doing he's recognizing his day and his message and a True Believer is one who recognize what the word says about him and not what the word says about that person hello not what the word says about that person but what the word says about me amen amen because Malachi 45 is not about William brandom Malachi 45 is behold I send you amen I'm sending you we focus on the end part of the scripture Elijah the prophet but the scripture is addressing you behold amen I send you the scripture is talking to you is it talking in a third person or in a first person come on somebody got to work with me here now amen is he talking in a first person God Almighty amen behold I send you brother raes behold I send you brother Tyson I'm sending you Elijah the prophet and his ministry is going to turn your heart yes amen back to the faith back to perfect Faith amen glory thank you Jesus amen so the one that believes in what the word says about him the one that believes amen that everything in the Bible prophesied about me I see it coming to pass amen some people are more interested in the post man more interested amen hallelujah fixed on El fixed on [Music] Ela fixed on it and they're just like a tree planted By the Waters they believe they shall not be moved amen hallelujah they don't want to has subject himself to a five-fold Ministry a Ministry that is spoken of in the Bible in Ephesians 4:11 Ministry spoken of in the Bible that this ministry is going to bring you up into that stature of a perfect man amen no man shall attain the stature of a perfect man if they are not under a fivefold Ministry I'm going to say it again no one in this age will come to the stature of a perfect man if they are not under Ephesians 4:11 amen that's right go read what what the five4 ministry designed for now if I if you wanted someone to tile your house who must I send you a plumber so why don't you rely on whom God has sent the Bible says when he ascended on high he gave gifts unto men hallelujah praise the Lord amen so we don't want what God sent because we don't like God's gifts yes amen people people don't like God's gifts even Jesus said God's gifts are not recognized in his own country people don't like their own gifts they like International gifts amen you know there shops all around here but people don't want to go shop there now I got Sheen I shop directly I don't even go

choose amen hallelujah so the believer is the one who becomes the words in the book come on now this is not Child's Play The Believer is the one who becomes the words in the book amen the one that is able to take the book and read what the scripture says about him amen this day the spirit of The Sovereign Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me with good news to preach good news to preach the acceptable year of the Lord you know your scripture you are not moved by people what they are saying about you you read that scripture with authority amen yes amen Jesus closed the book and everyone marveled think he read it as if that talking about him you read the word like it's talking about you amen so the believer is the one where the words of the book become alive amen that's why Christ had perfect Faith because he recognized what the word said about him it's it's that simple Church Jesus had perfect Faith because he recognize what the word said about him amen so when the book is coming down from heaven an eternal message to give you perfect Faith it's the word coming to you can't you believe what the word is saying about you so the one with perfect faith is the believer amen who believes the words in the book if you don't have the book how you going to get the words in the book there's only one people prophesied in the Bible to have the book in this end time you can either choose to believe that or not you can either choose to connect with that or not you can May sympathize and say oh but denominations have the word I'd like to take you back to School of Theology amen and show you in the word that nobody else in this age has access to the open book and the open word besides John in this age amen everyone else you shut off they rejected the guide they rejected the teacher they denominated and they died the only one that is the access to the book is John who is strategically positioned in Revelation 10 oh yes oh praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah so the five-fold ministry in this hour must raise you up to the words in the book If the fire form Ministry is not raising you up to the words in the book about what your part of the

will show you present tense reality show you what the word says about you yes amen yes amen we all got faith in Moses Ministry we believe it with all our hearts Moses was the prophet Moses was the anointed Moses was the one who got the Ten Commandments but that don't do nothing for me exactly I must believe what the word says about me amen yes praise the Lord amen you see how easy it is to miss the mark in the message amen this is the age of back to the word am amen God is bringing you back to the word so you can have faith for a body change Hallelujah people have no regard for the word
