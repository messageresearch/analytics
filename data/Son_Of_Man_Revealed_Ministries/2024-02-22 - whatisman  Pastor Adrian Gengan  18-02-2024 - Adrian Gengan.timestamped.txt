[3:54] on what is a man amen what is man the
[3:58] age old question
[4:00] what is man now the woman don't need to
[4:03] feel excluded this morning because woman
[4:06] finds her identity in man yes you can't
[4:10] yes man is not complete without the
[4:12] woman so when we are speaking about what
[4:14] is a man we speaking also about the
[4:17] woman amen and this Revelation ought to
[4:19] Rejoice our hearts amen I tell you if
[4:23] any of us are not rejoicing here this
[4:24] morning then we have no
[4:28] representation we have see Gene within
[4:30] us amen because I asked you where were
[4:33] you when the sons of God shouted for Joy
[4:37] amen the morning Stars began to sing
[4:39] amen amen where were you yes Hallelujah
[4:43] I guarantee you if you were there amen
[4:44] you wasn't sitting somewhere quiet in a
[4:46] corner but you were rejoicing amen with
[4:49] hello him hallelujah hallelujah amen
[4:53] amen let's turn to Job chapter 7 I'm
[4:56] going to take three portions of
[4:57] scripture and show you three
[5:01] Genesis you know um job you know is one
[5:03] of the oldest books in the Bible amen
[5:05] one of the oldest men so he's asking a
[5:08] question we're going to find the Apostle
[5:10] Paul echoing the question and King David
[5:12] so you're going to find it there in the
[5:13] beginning you're going to find it in the
[5:15] Psalms and you're going to find it here
[5:16] in the New Testament amen so job 7:1 17
[5:20] says what is man that thou should us
[5:24] Magnify Him am amen and thou should set
[5:28] thine heart upon him
[5:32] and that thou should us visit him every
[5:34] morning and try him every
[5:37] moment now job is the one who starts out
[5:39] this
[5:40] question cuz it's a time period that
[5:43] passed since man had
[5:45] fallen and they couldn't understand the
[5:48] glory that man had with God so he begins
[5:51] to question what is man that thou should
[5:54] us Magnify Him and that thou should us
[5:57] set thine heart upon him and that thou
[6:00] should us visit him every morning and
[6:02] try him every moment we go to the book
[6:04] of Psalm
[6:12] 8:3
[6:15] amen Psalm 8:3 says when I consider the
[6:19] heavens what is Heaven's
[6:22] creation amen the work of thy
[6:26] fingers the moon and the stars which
[6:29] thou has ordained what is man yes amen
[6:33] now you you're studying galaxies you're
[6:35] studying stars but your question is not
[6:38] based on
[6:39] that he's pointing you to the heavenlies
[6:41] but he's asking you what is
[6:46] man that thou are mindful of him and the
[6:48] son of man that thou visited visitest
[6:51] him for thou has made him a little lower
[6:54] than the Angels you see even this is
[6:56] going a confus the Angelic realm you
[6:59] he's saying you made man a little lower
[7:00] than the
[7:04] Angels
[7:06] amen and has crowned him with Glory and
[7:09] Honor thou has made him to have dominion
[7:11] over the works of thy hands and thou has
[7:14] put all things under his feet amen you
[7:17] see David is acknowledging that this man
[7:20] is not is is made lower than Angels but
[7:22] how come you put him in authority of all
[7:26] things that has put all things in
[7:29] injection under his
[7:31] feet amen I'm going to read it again
[7:34] because some sickness may be over your
[7:35] head this morning some problem may be
[7:38] over your your head this morning but the
[7:40] Bible is saying here that thou has put
[7:44] all things under his subjection amen
[7:46] amen thou has put all things under his
[7:49] feet thank you all the Sheep The Oxen y
[7:51] the Beast of the field the fowl of the
[7:53] air the fish of the sea and whatsoever
[7:55] passes through the parts of the sea oh
[7:57] Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name
[8:00] in all the Earth so when man has
[8:02] Dominion the name of the Lord becomes
[8:04] excellent on the earth because he is
[8:06] representing God on the earth you may be
[8:08] seated as we go to Hebrews chap 2 and
[8:10] verse 5 now we come to New
[8:12] Testament we'll see the Apostle Paul
[8:15] speaking to us here
[8:20] amen he says For unto the angels have he
[8:24] not put in subjection the world to come
[8:27] you see it's not given to Angels
[8:30] whereof we speak but one in a certain
[8:33] place testified saying what is man that
[8:36] thou are mindful of him or the son of
[8:38] man that thou visitest him Thou made him
[8:41] lower than the Angels thou crownest him
[8:43] with glory and honor and this set him
[8:45] over the works of thine
[8:50] hand thou has put all things in
[8:53] subjection under his feet for in that he
[8:56] put all in subjection under him he left
[8:58] nothing that is not put under him oh I
[9:02] hope you're reading my
[9:03] Bible there is
[9:05] nothing amen thank you
[9:09] Lord amen thou has put all things in
[9:12] subjection under his feet for in that he
[9:14] put all in subjection under his feet he
[9:17] left nothing that is not put under him
[9:22] amen amen amen
[9:25] hallelujah but now we see not yet all
[9:28] things put under
[9:31] him time and
[9:33] season can be put yet why Revelation
[9:38] amen amen it's locked up it's locked up
[9:41] for an end time people amen yes amen but
[9:44] I've got good news for you this morning
[9:46] now is the time now is the season amen
[9:50] when all things are put under our feet
[9:53] amen glory be to His holy name amen
[9:56] hallelujah amen praise the Lord am amen
[9:59] so men have men have probed this
[10:01] question who am I yes where did I come
[10:05] from where am I going yeah you'll find
[10:08] these three questions man has to answer
[10:11] who am I what's my
[10:14] identity where did I come
[10:17] from where am I
[10:20] going is there meaning to life now the
[10:23] study of science has said that man
[10:25] evolve from a lower being I want you to
[10:28] know that's aive from the pit of Hell
[10:30] yes
[10:31] amen we'll show you in the Bible that
[10:34] God created man man did not evolv from a
[10:37] monkey and a
[10:39] chimpanzee matter of fact there's a
[10:40] little story the child you must have
[10:42] read this child went to the to the to
[10:46] the father and said Dad where did man
[10:49] come from and the father said well man
[10:52] evolved from monkeys and
[10:55] chimpanzees so he go goes to his mother
[10:57] and he says mom
[10:59] where does man come from and the mother
[11:02] tells him that we were created in the
[11:04] image and the likeness of God Amen and
[11:07] then he tells his mom but Mom Dad says
[11:09] that we evolve from chimpanzees the
[11:11] mother said well he's talking about his
[11:13] side of the
[11:16] family amen
[11:19] hallelujah now if you notice man is made
[11:23] different from the rest of
[11:25] creation man can think man can reason
[11:28] man has free choice man can create
[11:30] things man can invent things man can
[11:33] improve the quality of his life amen but
[11:36] what makes him so different why is he so
[11:39] different from all of
[11:41] creation who made him this way what is
[11:44] man that thou are mindful of him yes
[11:47] amen people look to religions to find
[11:49] the answer amen people they look into
[11:52] science to find the answer they look to
[11:54] philosophers to find the answer but man
[11:57] cannot answer that question
[12:00] that's why it's called the theory of
[12:04] evolution there's only one answer
[12:07] there's only one answer and that answer
[12:10] is found in the one that created man
[12:13] amen yes you've got to go to the source
[12:16] to find the answer of what is man that
[12:18] thou are mindful of
[12:22] him and I ask you we read three passages
[12:25] of scripture that question has never
[12:29] been answered till this
[12:33] day amen
[12:36] hallelujah just like how the only one
[12:38] who can answer the question of what is a
[12:41] woman is a man because man was taken
[12:44] from woman was taken from the side of a
[12:46] man yes Adam gave the woman a identity
[12:50] yes amen what did he say this is born of
[12:53] my bone Flesh of My Flesh she is the
[12:55] feminine part of man that was taken out
[12:58] of man amen amen so this is the question
[13:01] we want to answer amen and the question
[13:04] can only be answered from the word of
[13:05] God Amen so you have to come to the
[13:08] creator of man to find out what is
[13:11] man because God is the one who created
[13:14] man and gave man his
[13:17] identity amen gave man his purpose gave
[13:21] man and put in positionally upon the
[13:23] Earth for a reason
[13:26] amen now you'll never know who you are
[13:30] if Christ is still a mystery to
[13:34] you God can't be a mystery to you
[13:38] because your identity is locked in him
[13:41] unveiling himself amen yes that is why
[13:45] they couldn't fathom who is man that is
[13:48] why Through the Ages they asked what is
[13:50] man we don't get
[13:52] it you've created angels and I you've
[13:56] created all of these things but why have
[13:58] given given your glory to
[14:02] man amen you see outside of knowing god
[14:05] and amen the Salvation through Christ
[14:07] man has no
[14:10] identity people are walking around not
[14:12] having a relationship with Christ they
[14:14] have no identity you ask him where do
[14:16] they go after this life oh I don't know
[14:18] we'll see what happens amen they have no
[14:21] concern amen hallelujah man has no value
[14:25] man has no worked outside of Christ
[14:26] there's no reason for existence and no
[14:29] meaning of life there's no joy outside
[14:32] of Christ how many of you can testify
[14:34] amen there's no peace outside of Christ
[14:36] there's no satisfaction no purpose man
[14:39] finds his Essence man finds his meaning
[14:42] man finds his purpose when he knows
[14:44] Jesus Christ give him a hand clap of
[14:46] Praise glory be to his name amen so we
[14:49] find that man lost his identity through
[14:51] the fall in Eden amen and man has been
[14:54] living with his Amnesia and has
[14:56] forgotten who God created him to be amen
[14:59] Satan has so blinded man and kept the
[15:02] truth hidden from man in fact Satan
[15:04] doesn't want you to get the revelation
[15:06] of who you
[15:07] are amen he knows if you get the true
[15:09] revelation of who you are what you stand
[15:12] for then Satan is powerless before
[15:15] you amen hallelujah because he knows
[15:18] amen hallelujah that power lies in the
[15:20] revelation of who man
[15:23] is amen it's game over for Satan then
[15:27] amen amen Hallelujah he will be stripped
[15:30] of everything that he has stolen from
[15:32] man if man only recognizes who he
[15:37] is amen the kingdom of God the kingdom
[15:41] of man was stolen in Genesis from the
[15:43] man we find after the fall man lost the
[15:47] title deed as ruler over the earth and
[15:50] the title deed went back to the original
[15:52] owner God and what happened Satan
[15:54] exalted himself as God of the
[15:57] earth and now he sits as the God of this
[15:59] evil age yes amen
[16:02] amen
[16:04] hallelujah so man in his Fallen
[16:07] condition why not leave man in his
[16:10] condition because God said his word the
[16:13] day you eat of those frood you shall
[16:14] surely die why not let him continue in
[16:18] that condition of Fallen
[16:21] State why not leave
[16:25] it man was given a choice he chose the
[16:28] of good knowledge of Good and Evil why
[16:31] not just let men live in a fallen State
[16:33] and continue in that condition why have
[16:35] a plan to redeem man what is man that
[16:39] you are mindful of him
[16:41] yes amen hallelujah amen but we thank
[16:45] God for the revelation of the hour amen
[16:47] amen that we are a part of God Amen to
[16:49] deny us is to deny his very own self
[16:52] amen glory be to his name to redeem man
[16:55] is to redeem a part of himself amen
[16:59] Hallelujah to redeem man is to redeem
[17:02] back his original thoughts about
[17:04] man God cannot leave you unredeemed
[17:06] church amen God cannot leave you
[17:09] unredeemed amen hallelujah and in a
[17:12] fallen stage because man in a fallen
[17:14] state has no
[17:16] value there's no substance to that man
[17:20] but man has worth man has Glory man has
[17:23] aen because man is the ultimate form of
[17:26] God's glory on the earth yes glory be to
[17:29] his name amen amen amen I'll say it
[17:32] again man is the ultimate form of God's
[17:35] glory on the earth
[17:37] amen
[17:39] hallelujah amen you say can we share his
[17:42] glory listen what brother brandham says

[18:27] something up about I Shar God's glory
[18:29] here's the prophet of the age saying
[18:30] since Calvary we are invited to share

[18:36] are baptized into his body by one Spirit
[18:38] we are all baptized and then we become
[18:41] part of him so what did it the spirit of
[18:44] God Amen now here you know in Romans 8

[30:50] than amen amen what a glorious day that
[30:53] must have been for creation amen that is
[30:56] why creation is growing
[30:58] you know if you lose something glorious
[31:00] you'll always gr for it to come
[31:02] back amen like some of us are longing to

[31:34] want you to know something the angels

[31:49] called strong
[31:51] Angel the
[31:53] angels are created in magnificent
[31:58] magnificence they are Majestic they are

[32:03] says that the angels are ministering
[32:06] Spirits sent forth to the ears of
[32:09] Salvation yes
[32:11] amen come on now we got to stick with
[32:13] Bible yes amen angels are messengers
[32:16] from
[32:17] God angels carry out the work of the
[32:20] Lord like when he wanted to destroy the
[32:22] Earth with water the angel warmwood step
[32:26] forth amen praise the
[32:29] Lord
[32:30] hallelujah when when Daniel was seeking
[32:34] answer to the vision what happened
[32:36] Gabriel came down yes amen praise the
[32:38] Lord amen the Lord and there's a Waring
[32:41] Angel called
[32:43] Michael amen amen who stands at
[32:46] attention and anytime there's a word

[33:04] amen coming to slay that old
[33:07] enemy Lord praise the Lord praise the
[33:10] Lord praise the Lord amen so what are
[33:13] these they serve as messengers of God
[33:15] Amen Hallelujah now think of it the
[33:19] angel there was no other Angel no other
[33:22] being created like
[33:25] Lucifer
[33:28] right outside of
[33:30] God
[33:33] Lucifer glorious
[33:35] being amen that is why Lucifer became
[33:39] jealous when he saw
[33:41] Man created in the image and likeness of
[33:44] God because Lucifer is not made that way
[33:49] yes amen he was boasting about the way
[33:52] he was created he got puffed up he got
[33:55] proud because he was the most beautiful
[33:58] angel created and he thought there was
[34:00] none like
[34:01] him beside God there was nothing else
[34:04] that could match him he was the anointed
[34:07] cherub amen praise the
[34:12] Lord but he did not
[34:15] know that there was when he saw all of
[34:17] creation he didn't
[34:19] mind he saw beast of the field birds of
[34:21] the air fowls he didn't mind he thought
[34:25] look at these beast and these things
[34:29] if he's got a heart he had a heart
[34:31] attack that day when God said let us
[34:34] make
[34:35] man in our image and after our likeness
[34:39] oh yes the devil went into a mountain
[34:41] what is
[34:44] this he didn't know there was one more
[34:47] mystery locked up in the back part of
[34:48] God's mind that was the mystery of God
[34:51] now coming forth through man amen amen
[34:53] let us make man in our image and after
[34:55] our likeness am Angels were not made
[34:57] that way they were made in the image
[34:59] amen hallelujah they were not made in
[35:01] the image and likeness of God Amen so he
[35:04] gets a shock attack when he hears God
[35:06] saying let us make man
[35:09] amen amen hallelujah ajah praise the
[35:13] Lord
[35:14] amen oh I believe this this kind of

[46:33] quote amen praise the Lord this is for
[46:37] the unbelievers
[46:41] now let's go to quote number one
[46:47] then he says I think that the people
[46:50] today that are possessed with the
[46:53] spirit capital S right talking about the
[46:56] Holy
[46:57] Spirit or the spirit part of these
[47:00] Angelic beings Spirits which
[47:03] what where did your spirit rotate
[47:06] of your spirit rotated off of
[47:11] God that never fell in the beginning and
[47:14] resisted the devil's lie in heaven amen
[47:17] amen you see where your spirit comes
[47:19] from you rotated off of God yes praise
[47:22] the Lord praise the Lord praise the
[47:24] Lord
[47:26] amen let's go to the next quote there
[47:29] not in Mighty God unveil but in who is
[47:31] God Amen paragraph 16 just to detail
[47:33] this very quickly so first now he's
[47:35] giving you now remember I told you your
[47:37] identity can only be found in knowing
[47:39] who God is amen that is why I made the
[47:42] statement at the beginning it was locked
[47:44] up for an end time people because only
[47:46] at the end did God send Revelation 10:7
[47:50] and what is 107 sent to do reveal the
[47:52] mystery of God so when God the mystery
[47:55] of God is revealed your identity is
[47:57] fully unlocked then the question can be
[48:00] answered what is man that you are
[48:02] mindful of him yes
[48:05] amen amen now let's see the origin of
[48:08] God
[48:09] here first was god Jehovah right let's
[48:12] just draw a picture a drama you can get
[48:14] it coming out of space where there's
[48:16] nothing let's make a little white light
[48:19] like a Mystic light like a
[48:21] Halo so now God is a Halo right and
[48:25] there that was the logos that went out
[48:27] from God at the beginning that was the
[48:29] son of God that came out of the bosom of
[48:31] the father that was what was in the
[48:33] beginning was the word and the Word was
[48:35] God and the Word was God and the Word
[48:37] was made flesh and dwelt amongst us in
[48:40] the beginning was God and then out of
[48:42] God came the logos a part of God that
[48:45] went out of God
[48:48] right he says now he's talking about man
[48:51] that was talking about God now you what
[48:52] the prophet is saying that man is not
[48:55] coming from from animal life no sir
[48:57] we're not at any senses of animal life
[49:00] God made us that's right then I ever
[49:03] notice then he was here on Earth and he
[49:06] gave him a almet and so forth he he had
[49:09] blessed fellowship with his father
[49:12] speaking and now we're going to make the
[49:15] second the first man you can't see him
[49:17] second man was
[49:19] a hello no no read here
[49:24] read what is man the spirit man did we
[49:28] just read that out of God came the Halo
[49:30] the light so he's
[49:32] saying man was a
[49:37] Halo remember we just read the quote now
[49:39] the spirit rotated off of
[49:42] God right follow
[49:45] now now he takes a third man and he
[49:49] makes him a little white cloud you see
[49:53] why people don't like the big white
[49:54] cloud
[49:57] because they are not a little white
[50:04] cloud I just told you you are made of
[50:06] the same material as the big white cloud
[50:08] yes yes right that's what my entire
[50:10] message was about that we are made of
[50:12] the same substance the same material as
[50:14] God Almighty so if he is the big white
[50:17] cloud oh yes amen we are the little
[50:21] white cloud come on rejoice over the
[50:24] cloud
[50:26] yes now watch what he says
[50:28] here
[50:30] see makes him a little white cloud
[50:32] coming over we can see him Holy Spirit
[50:34] coming down and he's all man that's the
[50:37] soul of man Eternal then amen thank you
[50:41] Lord your soul is called The Little
[50:42] White Cloud Sure amen amen praise the
[50:46] Lord I'm going to go into this to show
[50:49] you how man got redeemed now and after
[50:51] this man sinned he mared that Soul you
[50:52] see he mared the little white cloud yes
[50:56] Blackness Darkness came into it and then
[50:58] God came down and lived in man suffered
[51:00] with man to redeem man and the Holy
[51:03] Spirit Come into man and drives that
[51:05] Blackness and sin away from him and
[51:08] brings him back into perfect Fellowship
[51:10] a part of God that's why he says since
[51:12] Calvary we can share his glory amen yes
[51:16] Lord and now by the way by the blood of
[51:19] Christ who cleanses us from sin we
[51:21] become Sons and Daughters of God
[51:24] Amen yeah what says the one that stood
[51:26] there and rolled Stars off his hands
[51:28] rolled worlds out of his hands and made
[51:31] things which do not appear deity and
[51:33] deity himself lives in the
[51:37] heavens and deity himself lives in man
[51:40] the Creator that made heavens and earth
[51:42] lives in
[51:43] mankind why no wonder cripples when you
[51:46] realize that can straighten out the
[51:48] Creator here amen but the power of your
[51:51] spoken word these signs shall follow
[51:53] them they believe when they lay hands
[51:55] upon the sick they shall recover and
[51:57] when that person recovers you better
[51:58] know the Creator is here on the earth
[52:01] tabernacling
[52:03] Men Thank You Lord amen praise the
[52:10] Lord realize who we you sto short of
[52:13] saying they are realize who we are the
[52:16] Bible says we are Sons and Daughters of
[52:18] God he Offspring then with something
[52:20] like God was Jesus said himself it is
[52:23] written you are Gods amen written in
[52:26] your law we become a part of God a Son
[52:28] of God by adoption through Jesus Christ
[52:31] therefore if you realize that the very
[52:33] God that made the dirt and the Earth and
[52:35] whatever is here is living among men
[52:37] where is your faith
[52:39] at these things that I do when he was
[52:42] here greater shall he do for go to my
[52:44] father whatsoever things you desire When
[52:46] you pray believe you receive them and
[52:48] you shall have them that's the Creator
[52:53] speaking then it doesn't doesn't lay in
[52:55] him it lays in
[53:01] heaven where does that creative power
[53:04] lay it doesn't lay in him it lays in us
[53:08] us that's the message who is
[53:11] God Amen praise the Lord out of the
[53:14] mouth of two or three Witnesses amen we
[53:17] got to get another quote so this is in
[53:18] the message the resurrection of
[53:22] Lazarus he said let us plural make man
[53:25] in our plural own image now if God is
[53:27] unseen if the logos logos was in the
[53:30] form just mythical speaking in the form
[53:33] of a Halo then it's supernatural then he
[53:36] had to make man in his own image John 4
[53:39] says that God is a spirit and he had to
[53:41] make a spirit man and he brought it down
[53:45] now there deity cannot be seen deity is
[53:49] the supernatural amen then he brings it
[53:52] down from a sacred Halo to a little
[53:54] white cloud
[53:55] something that's more visible that's
[53:59] man he gave him the rulership over the
[54:02] kingdom and he governed the Beast like
[54:04] the Holy Spirit leads the church today
[54:06] but there was no man to till the soil
[54:08] then he put man in the image of man on
[54:11] earth created him out of the Dust of the
[54:13] earth and that's where science gets
[54:15] mixed up you see now don't let us get
[54:17] mixed up with the flesh man yeah know
[54:20] who we are yes the inner man amen the
[54:24] spirit man yeah
[54:25] Hallelujah now you know why David is
[54:27] saying my substance was not hid from
[54:32] thee let them dig as many fossils as
[54:34] they want to that doesn't have a thing
[54:36] to do on the bearing of the word of God
[54:39] there he is there yes's this man and now
[54:43] the man sinned and when he sinned he
[54:44] fell that little cloud in there became M
[54:47] and
[54:49] black then the Lost came down and was
[54:52] made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem
[54:53] this man back to the love of the the
[54:55] father and he be and he came in by the
[54:57] baptism of the Holy Spirit and chased
[55:00] sin out of the human and brings man back
[55:03] again in fellowship with God you believe
[55:05] that that's where you are that's what
[55:07] the matter with your Pentecostal people
[55:09] they don't recognize who they are you're
[55:11] Sons and Daughters of God you have in
[55:13] your hand then Jesus said it was quoted
[55:16] one time in the scripture you are Gods
[55:18] he says look deity I'm a part of Charles
[55:21] brandham because I was born from Charlie
[55:23] brandham my daddy I'm a part of him I
[55:26] got a forehead like him my hair was like
[55:28] him I'm a small man like him I'm in the
[55:31] nature like him because he's my dad and
[55:33] if we become in spirit sons of God deity
[55:36] dwells in man Hallelujah then you talk
[55:39] about blind eyes being open they said
[55:41] nothing's impossible to God God said
[55:43] nothing impossible with you if you
[55:46] believe not with God but you amen amen
[55:50] deities in man the very God that stood
[55:53] back there on the mythical platform of
[55:55] the eternities and rolled worlds of his
[55:57] hand and Creator those things gives you
[56:00] the privilege to be his son you're a
[56:02] part of him God dwells in mankind and
[56:04] man himself is deity there you are it
[56:07] might choke you but study that a little
[56:10] God dwells in man and man becomes a Son
[56:12] of God not him in himself but the Holy
[56:16] Spirit that's in him is God amen amen
[56:20] yes the Creator lives in the creation oh
[56:23] I think of that then stand in unwavering
