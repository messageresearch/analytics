========================================

Each one needs may differ one from the other, but we know that you're more than able to meet with every need, Father. &gt;&gt; And I pray, Lord, the bless, the best blessing from the service that we can receive now, Lord, is your word, Lord, being implanted in our hearts, oh God. And I pray now as we give praise and glory and honor and reverence to you. We give thanks to you. We ask it now in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be found in the eyes of God once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We all glad to be found once again &gt;&gt; uh in the house of God on a Wednesday night meeting &gt;&gt; to come and get refreshed in his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. our Bibles to turn to the book of Ezekiel, chapter 36, reading from verse 26- 27. the book of Ezekiel. &gt;&gt; A new art also would I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony art of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh, and I will put my spirit within you. So firstly he's saying here he's going to take away your stony art out of your flesh. Then he said I will give you an art of flesh. Then he'll say then he says then he says and I will put my spirit &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; within you. &gt;&gt; So there got to be a change first. He's got to change your your spirit. &gt;&gt; Then he's going to put his spirit in you. Amen. and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them. Very quickly to the book of Ephesians chapter 5 verse 1 and 2. D E therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also had loved us and had given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for his sweet smelling savor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just before we be seated, one more scripture. Uh 2 Corinthians 2:15. It reads, "For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish." Amen. You may be seated. So God is saying, you know, the prophet of God tells us, he says, I just read it to you the way he says it. He says, notice in the tabernacle, God lived in them three rooms. You lived in three rooms. I've got, he said, brother Madam, I've got 10 rooms in my house, but you're still only living in three. That's right. He said that's the kitchen, dining room, the kitchen, the living room, and the bedroom. So you, no matter how many rooms you got in a home, you're actually only living in three rooms. All right? So you may have three bedrooms. You may have a subkitchen, call a dining room, but there's still only three rooms in your house. You're living in a house, soul, body, and spirit. That's the way God lived in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is not going to live in any other way. &gt;&gt; The way he lived in Christ is the way he's going to live in us. &gt;&gt; Now it's easy in our Christian walk or as many Christians believe it's easy to focus on the purpose why Jesus come and they focus on yes he came he was born and he had to die and raise again. &gt;&gt; But we are also the the message of the hour comes to bring us into the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are if we have to come into the image of the Christ we have to follow Christ lifestyle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And watch his image through the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ is the mystery of God being revealed. And we know he's a principal theme of the Bible. But when we look at his earthly journey, he showed us the life. Amen. And we got to follow his his his uh image because right from infancy right from there at the age of 12 when he was in the temple and he was speaking to the priest and so forth the scribes and Pharisees and so forth and then when Mary and Joseph came looking for him they they said we your father's been looking for he said the word now in infancy stage is correcting the error. &gt;&gt; Yes. He said, "Don't you know about I'm about my father's business." &gt;&gt; So Jesus was showing us there the very type that if we had to follow Christ, he was always about the father's business. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word was growing from infancy to a mature catcher. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there were different stages along the journey. So he says to us, so if Christ lived in, if God lived in Christ in that way, he says that's the way God lived in Jesus Christ, both soul, body, and spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, not me that doeth the works, the father that dwelleth in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we know that we have to for for God to dwell in us. The prophet of God says, he says, "And in this tabernacle completion, and it was also through the age of Luda, to justification, to the age of Wesley to sanctification, and in this latter day with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, perfecting his church in three stages of the journey, all around everything's three." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, notice, "And then God taken his church in this great tabernacle. Now those the mana fell outside in the courts &gt;&gt; and remember the people eat this mana but God told them to take up this mana and put it a bunch of it back in the holy place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And there was the ark. The ark is a type of the human heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The ark. The place the hidden place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he says, "God prophesied to the prophet and said, I will write my laws in their hearts." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where I put them in the table of their hearts, &gt;&gt; showing that there that they would be that that would be the dwelling place of God in the human hearts. &gt;&gt; Not the human heads. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But the human hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I will write them in my h in their hearts and they'll they'll keep my statutes and so forth say the Lord. Now God said in another place over in Ezekiel he said I will in that day take out your old flesh fleshy stony and I'll give you a new spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll put my spirit in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now a lot of people even you Pentecostal people a lot of time get mistaken in that you get a new spirit that's not God's spirit that's you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That isn't God. You get a little happy because you got a new spirit and you jump up and down, run around all over the floor maybe and shout a little bit and speak with tongues and run around a little bit and think you got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's not it. That's a new spirit God gave you. &gt;&gt; That's you. Then after he give you your spirit, then he said, "I'll put my spirits." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see why God just couldn't put his spirit. &gt;&gt; There had to be a change of heart. &gt;&gt; Change your nature. There had to be a nature change because you had to become, you had to adapt to his spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, that's the matter with the missile cramps you got today. That's right. That's the reason you can get nowhere with God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So you see, you can't bypass certain things in the walk with God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You wonder why after so many years you've come and you sitted in the message of the hour, received the message of the hour, but you're not progressing in your walk &gt;&gt; because you can't bypass these steps. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You wonder why sometimes some people are still all still got that old starchy ways. There's still no character development in them. &gt;&gt; There's still no progression in their walk. &gt;&gt; You go there, they're always grumpy. &gt;&gt; They're always miserable. They're always negative &gt;&gt; because there hasn't been a change of heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. They still got a stony heart. &gt;&gt; They are still They might be receiving the message, but it's receiving it by intellect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Receiving it out of this. God wants to dwell in the arts. &gt;&gt; He don't want to he don't want you to have a head knowledge of the message. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It want it want his word to be embedded in your hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the betting ground for the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, notice you put a new spirit, God has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you can get along with yourself. &gt;&gt; That old devil spirit you had in you. So, he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will put a new spirit in them. And I will put my spirit in them." He said, "After give you a new spirit, that's you." Don't get it confused with God's spirit. &gt;&gt; It's your spirit. So, you can get along with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's doing a change in you now. Amen. He's preparing you to receive him the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because why? He wants to come in the control tower of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From there he wants to navigate your life. &gt;&gt; From there he's going to teach you his words. &gt;&gt; Because he said I will not leave you comfortless. &gt;&gt; I will be with you even in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "Don't get it confused with God's spirit. It's not you. It's your spirit. So you you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you." Amen. Cuz you in your condition never get along. You can't get along with your wife. You can't get along with your husband. Can't get along with your neighbor. How are you ever going to get along with God? Yes. &gt;&gt; So, he has to give you a new spirit for you can get along with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God's aim is for you to come into oneness with him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's aim is for you to project his very image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you to walk in his very to be a partaker of his divine nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "So he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his spirit in you. Gives you a new spirit, a new outlook, new faith, then he puts his holy spirit in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why after Peter after the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes down on the day of Pentecost, Peter is preaching a message. Amen. And they're asking Peter, "Now, what do we do to be saved?" Now, Peter had the key to the kingdom. Amen. Because prior to that, he had a revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Peter, I give you the key." &gt;&gt; And here's Peter now is now opening this key to the kingdom on the day of Pentecost. Amen. People are pricked in their heart. They believing what he said. He's preaching a profound message. The same Peter that denied Jesus Christ, but they can see a change in him. The same Peter was a hardened man. The The same Peter who would curse God, who would curse the people because he was denying Jesus Christ, but now there's a change in his heart. Amen. There was a preparation taking place so God could drop down his spirit in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he's ask they're asking now Peter, we can see a change in you. We can see something's happening here, Peter. Because we are looking at your life what it was then and we seeing the change. We sing the power of transformation in your life. We believe your message Peter because why you're not just preaching a message Peter is the change in you. &gt;&gt; Can you say now what do we do? Be saved Peter. Then he says then Peter said unto them repent every one of you and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must come first into true repentance. Yes. &gt;&gt; Justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. You cannot bypass these stages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And true repentance come with a man that man with a son and daughter of God when they come when they come to realization that I cannot do this on my own. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; I cannot save serve God. I'm I am a sinner. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in Romans 3:23, for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You realize that you can't do anything to save yourself. &gt;&gt; And you come to true repentance. Say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I need salvation. I need to be saved. Lord, true repentance brought by the altar. Having a genuine something must be pricked in your heart. It's a personal experience. Somebody else cannot give you that experience." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody can preach it to you, but they cannot give it to you. Amen. It's your personal experience with God. You got to have that. It's a one-on-one encounter with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word will be preached to you. And by the preaching of the word, God uses the preaching of the word to convict the heart. So if your heart is convicted, something's got to take place within you. Then you got to come to a realization of true repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when you come to realization, you got to believe the words. &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't we receive the the message the other day? this gentile woman, this widow woman, when the word came to her, Amen. She first had to before the pro, there was a prophecy in there that the barrels don't run dry, oil won't run out, but she had to receive the word first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She had to obey the word first. Amen. &gt;&gt; She took the word in her heart and she obeyed the word and she's going now to be to sacrifice all that she had. And she took the two sticks. Amen. But something took place in her. She began to be bubbly. She began to praise God because she saw there was a man of God speaking to her and she knew there was a prophecy that's going to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She believed the man of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; She believed the word of his prophecy. Amen. &gt;&gt; And but before the prophecy come to pass, there had to be a sacrifice that you had to take take place. Amen. She had to become obedient to the words. Amen. Then she took the she took the the flour. She took the oil. But then she had to put it on two sticks. Amen. And then she had to burn the fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? It had to now to for it to come into that proper bread that she's going to bake. Amen. It had to go through the fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it took a sacrifice before the prophecy comes to pass. &gt;&gt; Before God's prophecy come to pass in your life, in my life. Amen. We've got to become obedient to the word. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a sacrifice. We've got to die to self. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you find that when is the true change in you. Amen. And you receive that. Then you take the word baptized in the way he wants you to be baptized. Amen. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; People stopped when he started shouting. People stopped when he started dancing and speaking in tong so forth but they didn't go on to receive he the holy ghost himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The person of the Holy Ghost they they they stopped when they received the gifts of the Holy Spirit. But when it was he the Holy Ghost himself. Amen. There was a difficult part &gt;&gt; because there's a responsibility on a person when they received him the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost will not make you live your life contrary to his nature. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost navigates your life. The Holy Ghost brings conviction upon you. The minute you think evil thoughts, &gt;&gt; the minute you want to do something contrary to his word, he brings you into submission to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He brings you into a full submission to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He makes you live a surrendered life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People don't want to do that because why? They want to have it the easy way. &gt;&gt; Because why? the influence of Leia is upon him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he's come to give us, he wants us, but he come in this day to give us the mind of Christ to be seated in heavenly places to live above. Amen. &gt;&gt; To live above our circumstances, to live above the worldly situations. Amen. He's given us an anointing of a flying eagle in his day. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's anointed. That's why though you can receive the word, but you got to receive the anointing that comes with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you receive the anointing that comes in the word, Amen. It's the anointing that will keep you above. Amen. In heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we know the prophet told us about the three stages of God inward work in a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Just for the topic tonight, we speaking on from a new spirit to spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because firstly, there got to be a change of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. from your stony heart to heart out of flesh. In other words, he's changing your nature. He's changing your spirit to adapt to his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's changing your spirit that is not contrary to his spirit. The boat must complement each other. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The boat must get on with each other. &gt;&gt; The boat must be in oneness. He said, "Father, may they be one even as we are one." &gt;&gt; Christ and his church must come into oneness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what King Aasserus was waiting for. &gt;&gt; He was waiting for his queen to come into union with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he built a complex. When he was rejected by Vashi &gt;&gt; when Vashi rejected him, the king built a complex because this king was a gentleman. He wasn't going to force himself to go to the queen. &gt;&gt; He wanted the queen to come to him. And then he went he must have went to a stage of depression and then he went to the inner court of the king's palace and he was there but Es Esther needed to approach him. Amen. But through the five-fold ministry having the same influence having the influence of Morai of William Brandham's message through the having the influence on the five-fold ministry which is what the Holy Ghost working through the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. It has to be the Holy Ghost. Amen. But he said, "I'll run this trail again." So, who's riding this trail? Who's riding this trail again? It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll ride this trail again." It's not man riding the trail. It's the Holy Ghost riding the trail. But the Holy Ghost works with man &gt;&gt; and he's working through the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, he brings Esther now into show what you should be doing in an hour. Amen. Then she has that she puts on a a royal apparel. Amen. What it is showing that she's the queen now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then when she goes to the king now that is what he wanted all the time. He wasn't going to force and call for her. He waiting for her to come to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the prophet says the Holy Ghost is a gentleman. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's not going to force himself to you. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why in the letter when he said in this day when the door we know what the door is coming to the message of the hour. Amen. Coming in this day when the Holy Ghost is coming down they put him out the church because why? They are the wrong door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he's coming to the right door. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when we know the door is through marriage is through a union. Amen. And we know now when this king when when when this king sees Esther all his complex the complex that he built up this depression that he built up is all gone now &gt;&gt; because when he sees that all he sees how much he loves her &gt;&gt; how much he wants to be with her how much he longs to be with her and then he knows that they two must become one &gt;&gt; there must be a oneness with them amen that's why Jesus said, "Many will come to me in that day and said, Lord, Lord, have I not prophesied in your name? Lord, have I not cast out demons in in your name?" He said, "Depart from me, workers of iniquity. I know you not." &gt;&gt; No union, no relationship, no wonders. Amen. But this king now when he sees they come into they come into your union because what the king what is the aim of the king? He must have someone. He must come into oneness with his queen so he can reproduce himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's going to he's going to die otherwise a depressed man. &gt;&gt; He's got a queen and he's waiting to come into oneness with the queen so he can reproduce himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what? So so this will be the heir of the throne. &gt;&gt; Yes. And so when he sees Esther and then he sees himself now this is the time where this king can come in oneness and when she comes into this position when she comes and recognizes uh who she really is and what she can do now that is the time where she can rewrite the laws &gt;&gt; because why that's the power that she possess. Amen. that thou must prophesy again before nation, tongues, and kings. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the church, they've got the they got their own mouthpiece. Amen. But he said they will be one that will have be who speak for him &gt;&gt; in and through this bride. Amen. He said she will become the final voice in the final age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God will fulfill his work through this bride. Amen. So he says the prophet of God says here God is working in three stages of of a inward work in every believer. Amen. We know that firstly we were talking about a prophet we have to have a change of heart. Amen. What he does now removes our stony unbelieving heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The heart that kind of heart through our intellect we learned we go to school we get an education we influence in school we influenced through the media we influenced by the people around us how we see things in around our life but when there's a change of heart and when we see things to God's word we see things differently amen &gt;&gt; we no longer walk after the way we used to walk &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and therefore you'll find that people around you people know you will see a change in you. &gt;&gt; They will see a develop a character development in you. &gt;&gt; That they never saw before. They say, "But you used to be this person. You used to be this person that used to drink a lot. You used to be a person that used to swear a lot. Used to be a violent person. What has happened to you? &gt;&gt; Tell me why you changed. They will see it in you. It becomes visible in you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what happened? It gives you a tender teachable spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. You are able to have a teachable spirit &gt;&gt; and learn the things of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not hardened to the things of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why when you can when you have when you when there was a time and season for you to receive the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; you had a teachable spirit towards it. &gt;&gt; Although you you see you're hearing from a man that that is dead and gone a long time ago. &gt;&gt; What made you believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you had representation in you. Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You had a teachable spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To receive the thing that you're receiving, but yet you didn't have the Holy Ghost as yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he says, "The Holy Ghost must come in you now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God himself to dwell in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you are now ready, &gt;&gt; when there's a change, Amen. When there's a transformation inside you, &gt;&gt; your your stony heart now is a heart of flesh. Now &gt;&gt; he's given you a new spirit which is tender now. &gt;&gt; The one that can receive God. The one can worship God. The one that wants to praise God. The ones that want the one that wants to come into every service. The one wants to read the Bible. The one that wants to pray all the time. The one that want to raise up his hands and worship God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And always bubbly. The one that always rejoicing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then now he's ready to guide you. He's ready to give you his Holy Ghost because now he once he give you the Holy Ghost so you know what he once done with the word &gt;&gt; so you can be about his business. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because now you're going to be enjoyed with power from on high. Yes. &gt;&gt; So you can go because now he's been molding you. He's been shaping you. Remember none of none of these things come without suffering. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You must go through the fiery trials. &gt;&gt; You must go through the sufferings. You must be persecuted for Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when you go through all the stages, you must take up your cross and follow him. But what happened after the cross, the power of the resurrection, &gt;&gt; the power of the resurrected Lord living amongst you. &gt;&gt; Amen. What it is? It was a meal offering that the that was there given to the lady. Amen. To the widow woman. Amen. That she gave to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what happened when she put it in a fire? That meal offering came alive. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was ready. Amen. So just like that Christ is the meal offering that went to the cross. But when he went to the cross and endured the cross after that comes Christ again. Amen. The bread of life that was available to the church now. &gt;&gt; All that was in God he poured into Christ. All that was in Christ he poured into his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happened? The power of the resurrection must be displayed amongst us. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's no longer seeing God of history. It's saying the living God. here amongst us the living God dwelling amongst his people &gt;&gt; to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we say he's the same yesterday, today and forever. In other words, we need to watch the lives that he lived. &gt;&gt; The life of Christ must be displayed in his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If Christ started the church and Christ is in charge of the church, then Christ must project his life through the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we find that yes fair enough we we we took our old hearts and he gave us the heart of flesh. Then he gave us a new spirit. Amen. But that spirit was what? So we can get on with the Holy Ghost. But the Holy Ghost now is the one that can bring you now as an adopted son of God. That can bring you now as a son of God, a daughter of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because out of the Holy Ghost, he said I will not leave you comfortless. In other words, I won't leave you as an orphan here. Amen. I will come and I'll adopt you to myself. Amen. What happened to Esther? When her father and her parents died, she was an orphan. But God gave her Morai. Morai was the one going to bring and teach her the things that she need to be taught. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. and through Morai brings her in the right time to the king's palace the under the brought under the king's chamber preparing her to be brought before the king a guy. Amen. And &gt;&gt; as we have learned a guy brings you to the king. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To bring you to the king's presence. But the one now at is going to bring you now into your position. Amen. &gt;&gt; Into your rightful position as a queen now. showing you where you what you truly are meant have you what where you truly kept for. Amen. &gt;&gt; Were you preserved for such a time as this? &gt;&gt; Were you preserved for such a time as this? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When on this world when there's no mouthpiece for God when the world is in gross darkness is are you preserved for such a time of this? When the character of Christ must be displayed when you are saved for the greater works in his hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. in an hour for manifesting Christ upon the earth. Many people are manifesting other things but we want to manifest Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want we don't want to manifest a church. We don't want to manifest men. We want to manifest Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to manifest Christ in such a way that when the unbeliever comes here, the unbeliever must be convicted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the sick is here, when the people are demon possessed that are here, the demons don't stand in the presence of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just like what the what they said to Jesus. Oh, what what have we to do with you? Or what you have why have you come in this hour? And then Jesus cast him out into the piece. Amen. So the stony art was typing the nature of our sin, sinful nature. Amen. stubborn, unbelieving. It was there before God could dwell indwell in us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he removed that. Therefore, now the things that we used to do, we don't desire them no more. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you take someone who's a believer, who's full of the Holy Ghost now, and go leave them there. They won't be able to stand it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even if he falls, he won't be able to stay in that condition. &gt;&gt; He will come out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can throw him in the P and come out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because your nature is different. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your ch your chain body has changed. You now have a holy man's taste. &gt;&gt; You can now have a thinking man's filter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are able to see the things that are wrong. You're able to see the things that you used to do. You can't do it anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you can't digest it because why? You you you can't digest those things anymore. You're It's contrary to the nature that you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; So he gives us a new spirit after our conversion, a desire to do right. But many people are happy with that. Many people are just happy I've got the message of the hour. I've received it. I've got a spirit and I received it. But how many people I want to say, Lord, I don't want just to be in the message. I want the message to be in me. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just say I'm in the message. I want the message living in me. I want to be the manifested word. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to just have the written word, the spoken word. I want to be the manifested word in this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to walk out of the scripture that I believe in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know your word. Yes. We can all quote the scriptures about us. &gt;&gt; We all can know the word that we're walking in. But can we walk out of the scriptures? &gt;&gt; Can we live out the scriptures? &gt;&gt; Can the scriptures that pertain to us live out through us? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Live out in this hour when we about to leave the earth cuz it's time of the change is going to soon to be the changing of the baton. &gt;&gt; The gospel must go back to the Jews. &gt;&gt; Yes. [Music] Amen. He says, "Now the Bible said that he would give us a new heart and he would give us a new spirit." And and many people, even Pentecostal people and full gospel people have been deceived in that many times, God said, "I'll give you a new spirit." That wasn't his spirit. That's your spirit. He said, "Then I will put my spirit in you. I'll give you a new spirit and I will put my spirit in you." And many times you get the new spirit and think you've got the Holy Spirit. And trusting upon emotions and signs and things when your life doesn't pervy up to that. Now that's just a little raw. But remember it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Many people the spirit that spirit that new spirit God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his spirit. Now don't be deceived when people are jumping and shouting and amen. That's that's all good. That's all needed. It creates an atmosphere. But don't be deceived and think that person is full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Watch the life that follows after that. &gt;&gt; Watch if there is a life of consistency. Watch if there's a life of progression in the word. Amen. So he said so doubtful up and down. God has to give you a new spirit, give you a new nature so you can get along with his spirit when it comes. Amen. I hope you see it. God gives you a new spirit for yourself then puts his holy spirit in there to dwell with you and abide with you. Notice the same manner that was eat out in the courts was eat in also in the holiest of holies. But this manner out here give out quickly. &gt;&gt; You met people like that would eat out there and say, "Well, brother Brandham, I had the same thing. I did this and I did that just like they did." But I meet that woman, she's always on the housetop. There's never a worry in our mind. I meet that man wherever he is, he's got a big smile on his face and saying, "Praise the Lord. How you feeling? Wonderful." And every time he gets sick, the preacher comes, prays for him. Brother, he's out and gone. The next day is just wonderful. I just can't my blessing somehow. I can't all my blessing somehow. It's the place you're abiding at. It's where you at. I want you to get this close. Remember that many times on the campground there's blessings run out. You're eating the mana, the correct manner. You see the correct manner. You could be having drawing from the word, the message of Yahweh. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you haven't consecrated your life yet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And went into a place like Aaron behind the holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where he was in there, nothing. He didn't hear the world no more. &gt;&gt; He was shut in with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shut in with God. Amen. And what men and women need today after you've been brought into the kingdom of God is a hidden life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Men and women who will get with Christ and the curtains drop around. You don't care what the world says. You don't care what people says. You're living in there with Christ where the mana you eating from the golden pot of mana every day day and night all the time living on the mountain and indeed the cloud cloud cloudless sky when Aaron walked in there the curtain fell behind him he was all surrounded in a place to himself with God alone &gt;&gt; amen that's the place that every born again man and woman ought to be abiding today. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the rest of the world shut off from around them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the church need today is a hidden consecrated life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can be dabbling along with the world and impersonating and acting like them and hid with Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely. cuz you're trying to fashion after the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot be caught up in this influence of this age. &gt;&gt; We got to be caught up in the influence of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're trying to live like the next church. You're trying to belong to a better organization, wear better clothes, do so and so. That's not comply with Christianity. Christianity is a sacrificed life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. in life with God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Therefore, when that widow woman would do would would go and make that bake that cake for Elijah, it was a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because when she was baking that cake, she knew that her substance is going to run out. &gt;&gt; But she was holding on to the prophecy. &gt;&gt; She was holding on to the promise. Amen. because she identified that God was speaking to her directly. &gt;&gt; He was veiled in his prophet &gt;&gt; speaking to her directly. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God could be veiled tonight speaking to you directly. &gt;&gt; Amen. That he requires a sacrificed life. He required a consecrated life from you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz he wants to use you. And there's a promise. There's a prophecy. What is the prophecy? You will be a super church, a super race, an invincible army. You will do the greater works. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But before that come to pass, there's a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to have the hidden life, the consecrated life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where you are willing to die to self. &gt;&gt; Because when that woman did that and the two sticks and lit up the fire baked the cake, then what happened? That was one part of it. Fair enough. She had the substance increased in a household. But death came upon a child &gt;&gt; upon a son &gt;&gt; and now she had all that but she didn't have the spirit yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why the life of God must come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what was it? Where was it laying? &gt;&gt; The image. Where was God? Who was going to who was stretching for himself towards the the child? He was the prophet of God. But who was veiled in the prophets? &gt;&gt; It was God. So who brings who is what did Jesus said? I am the resurrection and the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if somebody is raised from the dead who's bringing them to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is Christ working through his prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; God veiled through his prophet bringing that son to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bringing it to what now? Now it is spirit there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he brought him back. Amen. Brought his soul back into that body to come into that image. What is that? Come into the image of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the hour. We've come to that. We have to got to come and sacrifice because it's coming to the time where we must come into the image of son of man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it takes the hidden life. It takes a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's so he says that's what the real Christian life consists of. Not of how well you can do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I might not be able to pronounce the word accurately. I might not be able to have the best grammar. I might not be able to to speak the way the certain speak speakers can speak. But it's not about that. Amen. That's not what the rest the Christian life consists of. Or how well you can sing or how well you can preach, that's fine. But that isn't it. It's a hidden life. &gt;&gt; Amen. consecrated the veil curtains dropped around you and you dead and buried and you hid in God to Christ and seal in there by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I must die to self. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You must die in self. So it not be I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It must come to that stage where the world don't see you but they see Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you. The hope of glory. Amen. Devil can't get to you. &gt;&gt; He can't do it. &gt;&gt; He has to come to the same process you did. &gt;&gt; If he did that, he'd be your brother. &gt;&gt; So he can get to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So stop saying the devil is stoping me. &gt;&gt; Rather get to the right process. &gt;&gt; Come to the right process. Come to repentance. &gt;&gt; Come to the consecrated life. Amen. And get Christ in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Get he the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you are promised the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Follow the remedy and you got the gift of the Holy Ghost which is promise to you. &gt;&gt; Then the devil, you can't be saying the devil is troubling me after that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I eat the good things of God. Yay. But you're in the courts out yonder. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's the reason you don't hold on. That's the reason this year you're doing pretty good and next year you're back in the world. this revival, you're doing fine while the revival's on. When the revival is gone, then you're gone somewhere else and out with the world. Now, I want to tell you something. You don't judge God's spiritual blessing by material gain &gt;&gt; or by the things of this or the way the world judge standards &gt;&gt; because if you do that then Elon Musk is your brother. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't judge God's blessings by that. These are things God will give you things that you need. But you don't judge a person of how rich they are or how wealthy they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you judge them that no matter what they go through, you can see Christ projected through them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They will praise God in the valleys, they will praise God in the mountains. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have a consistent Christian life. &gt;&gt; They won't be grumbling and mourning and blaming God. No, they'll be rejoicing. &gt;&gt; They'll be rejoicing in their troubles. They'll be rejoicing in their problems. They'll be saying, "Blessed be the name of the Lord. The Lord giveth. The Lord take it. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; My redeemer liveth." Amen. So you don't judge things the way the world judge it. So he says this the reason this year you're doing pretty good and next year you're back in the world and this revival you're doing fine while the revival's on. When the revival is gone, then you're gone somewhere else and out with the world. You say, "Oh, I received the Holy Ghost. I spoke with tongues. I shouted." That's all right. I have nothing to say about that. But why don't it hold out? That's it. That's what the world's looking at. That's what the people are saying. If you're professing this great eye calling, then why ain't you living like that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, the best thing is to live a sermon instead of preach one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You know that you written epistles. [Music] What that means? You written epistles. &gt;&gt; You have to live it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to live out the scriptures for your day. &gt;&gt; You can do it in yourself. You can impersonate it for a little while, but your sins will find you out. &gt;&gt; You better consecrate. You better just consecrate yourself to God and get on the inside. Shut the doors behind you and burn every barrier there is behind you and every bridge and launch out. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know it's the truth. I know it'll work. If it hadn't been for that, I don't know what would have become of me. That's right. But it ain't the people that you look at then. It's Christ. Notice in the same place there, they brought Aaron's rod &gt;&gt; and they laid it in there one night. &gt;&gt; Amen. and think the same rod. What did it do? It budded. It blossomed and yielded almonds the same night. What was it? It must have been an almond tree. &gt;&gt; That's where it originated from. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Staff there on the road must have come off an almond tree. So if we are we are part of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; We coming from the Christ tree. Amen. And we coming from him and we part of him and we shut him in him. Amen. In the inner court in the most holy of holies under the shina glory then what happened? You must but for &gt;&gt; you must bring forth Christ. &gt;&gt; You must bring forth the fruits of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You must bear forth the fruits &gt;&gt; because the tree you are you are from the Christ tree. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said I am the vine. You are the branches. If you abide in me and I abide in you, ask what you will. &gt;&gt; So if you're abiding in a vine, then you must bring forth the fruits. &gt;&gt; So this is the hour to become fruitful and multiply. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To bear forth the fruit of Christ. &gt;&gt; This is the hour not to be starchy, not to be gloomy. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there must be the power of the resurrection must be displayed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ must be on display. It's the end sign. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So how is this is the hour where all that the prophet has spoken about people have criticized him. People have there's many critics on the word but now you are on display. You are the people that the word are speaking about. If you are on display what are they going to speak about now? The devil's got nothing to speak about. Amen. [Music] So he says in the message, why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian life? He says, you get a new spirit, you quit drinking, you get a new spirit, you quit lying, you get a new spirit, you can do most anything with that spirit. But that isn't what God was talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A new spirit. He said, I'll give you a new art and a new spirit. Why? He'd have to give you a new spirit to live for him. Why? You couldn't even live with yourself with the spirit you you did have. You couldn't live with your neighbor. You couldn't associate with the next man or the next corner. You couldn't associate with this Christian. Why? You'd have an awful spirit. So, he has to give you a new spirit. I give you a new heart, a new spirit. Now, watch. And I will put my spirit in you. That's the difference. I'll put my spirit in you. So, it's nothing to do with you. You come the right way and he's going to give you the new spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not your works. You can't put in your mind and say I will be a good person. You can't come out and say today I will decide that I'm going to change my life. I'm going to be a good person. No, you got to come to repentance. He's given you the remedy. Repent every one of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he shall give you the gift of the Holy Ghost. Amen. He says, "Notice now, I'll give you a new spirit and I'll put my spirit." Notice the new heart is put right in the middle of you and the new spirit is put right in the middle of your new heart. And his spirit is put right in the middle of the new spirit. He just like the main spring in a famous watch. When that main spring set in the middle of the watch, it controls every movement of that watch. And that's what the matter friends. Now, I hope you see this. And I'm not saying it try to twist or to be indifferent. I'm only I'm only saying it because I know that someday I'll stand in the judgment with you. You see, if the Holy Spirit is in the middle of your spirit and that watch spring makes all the rest of the movement just tick just exactly to the place keeping perfect time. When the Holy Spirit is in the middle of your spirit, it makes every action of the Holy Spirit in you tick off just exactly according to God's time piece, the Bible, right? One more quote. He says, "When a man confesses his sins and get right with God and God drops the sin of this confession into the blood of his own blood and forgives that sin and replaces in that man the original spirit that should be there, his own spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Making him a son of God. You see what makes you a son of God now? When his spirit comes in you, I'm talking about adoption. Now, this is talking about adoption. Amen. How much more ought the creative power of God to be in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It breaks down every wall of sin. It breaks down. People today try to say those words was back for another another age. It is. If you're still out from under that blood, but if you're under that blood, the power of God, by his word remains the same, it's got to be the same. If he could do that by the blood of sheep and animals, what about the blood of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; How could he do it? Amen. So, he puts his original spirit in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he puts his spirit in you and then you now doing the will of the father. Amen. When you're about the father's business and you are growing into maturity and the Holy Spirit being your tutor, then he says, "Well done. This this son of daughter of God is now passed the tests." Then he says, "This is my beloved son. Yim, this is my beloved daughter. Y Amen. This is my beloved bride." Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She becomes now the final voice because why? You have come now to maturity. You have come to adoption. Amen. Because his spirit dwelling in you. His spirit making you act like him. Talk like him. Amen. Do the very works because he did part of his works that was pertaining to him 2,000 years ago. And the rest part of it, the remainder of the word had to be you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You had to complete that part of the word. It just like Queen Esther. The king did his part. He wrote his decree. The rest of the thing had to come from Queen Esther. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the king knew that if Esther had to die there, part of him is dead because she went to him &gt;&gt; and his seed would be laying in her. If Esther died, part of him is gone. But that part only Esther could do. Now &gt;&gt; he did his part. He said, "I give it off to the kingdom. Now it was her now to go rewrite the laws because the power was ling. He gave her the power. He equipped her. She had all the potential. She had the power. She had to go now and exercise the authority that was laying within her. &gt;&gt; Because she took the king's name. &gt;&gt; She has she everything that the king had she could exercise the authority. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. when she come to out of amnesia and recognize a true position and when she recognized a position she knew now what her potentials are. Amen. All the potential was laying within her. A position brings her into power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When she moves into position, it brings her into power. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the part that the king couldn't do because God wouldn't God only works with man. &gt;&gt; And there's things that God can just come and speak, it will happen. But he ordained it in such a way that we'll fulfill the remaining parts. &gt;&gt; Amen. He did his part when he came here 2,000 years ago. He done the work of grace for us. But our part is now to go and do the greater works &gt;&gt; to fulfill the rest of the prophecy. Amen. That's why he says thou shall prophesy again before nation, tongues, and kings. That part is left for us. There was a part the prophet had to do. There was a part we have to do. Amen. But he said, "I will not leave you comfortless." &gt;&gt; You are doing it with him dwelling in you. Because why? He's prepared you so that his holy ghost is navigating your life. It's the Holy Ghost that lived in you. &gt;&gt; It is him that is making you do the things that you do. It's not you that doeth the works. It is Christ that liveth in you that doeth the works. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So it is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just give you a final scripture. [Music] Open Galatians 4:19. My children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you. &gt;&gt; That is the end result. That is the purpose of this message. Amen. That Christ be formed in you. &gt;&gt; That was the message that come when you receive this word to that Christ be formed in you. That the world must see Christ again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Not a oneman ministry. but a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Our whole purpose &gt;&gt; on the surface. Our whole purpose in this life is for Christ to be formed in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Growing from glory unto glory. Different stages of our journey. Amen. We know it. The word started in infancy but it must come to maturity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Till all we see is the full where we come into the full stature of the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand? God bless you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Musicians, can we sing a song? Let the word be formed. [Music] Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. [Music] Let it live in me. Let it shine. serving size of fame and mold me every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. [Music] Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it shine. Live inside the day and mold me every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Sing create in me a clean [Music] heart. Oh Lord, I feel a right spirit within me, opening me, creating me. clean heart, oh God, and renew my spirit within me, and cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord. Take not thy holy spirit from me. [Music] Restore unto me the joy of my salvation I renew my spirit within me. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're going to say, "Lord, today take away my stony art, Lord." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And give me out of flesh. &gt;&gt; And say, "Lord," or maybe one of those that say, "Lord, I have a new spirit, but Lord, I want your spirit now. I want the Holy Ghost to come and dwell in me." You know the Lord wants to give you the Holy Ghost even more than you want it because he knows that when he gives you the Holy Ghost and that's the time he can navigate your life. [Music] If you want to make that decision today or even if you haven't come to a stage of having a personal relationship with God and say Lord forgive me Lord I'm a sinner Lord. And Lord, I want to know you personally. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to know you as my personal Lord and Savior. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to give my life to you, Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; I want to surrender my life to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; That you will come and live in me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; That your Holy Spirit may come and abide in me. Lord, &gt;&gt; teach me your ways, oh Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; dear friends, this is a very late hour now. &gt;&gt; This is not the time where we come just to have a normal service. This is the time where we come to make our lives right with God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to make sure that we want to be in the will of God &gt;&gt; and do the things that he want us to do. We want to be ambassadors of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to be about our father's business. &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be ambassadors of this of the country or of certain president or certain king on the earth. We want to be ambassador of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And lord of lords. Our father, our heavenly father with eyes full of mercy and a heart full of love. Lord, &gt;&gt; thank you father. &gt;&gt; You want to be tonight in remembered in prayer. We're going to pray for you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be. &gt;&gt; But you must believe by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without faith, it's impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; Father, we come to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; I know Lord many things could have been spoken and I had many things that I wanted to speak on but Lord you spoke in a certain direction tonight. I don't know why Father but you know why. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; You know the needs of your people oh God &gt;&gt; and Lord we know that you are still in the business of saving by your grace. Oh God you are still in the business of transforming lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; You are able to take the violent sinner. &gt;&gt; Yes. and transform their lives. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord &gt;&gt; Lord you are able to take a stony art and give it a heart. Make it out of flesh. You are able to transform Lord our nature and spirit so that Lord it will be it can be compatible to your holy spirit. Oh God and Lord you still want to give. You promise in your word that Lord you said they shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Oh God &gt;&gt; to them and to many that are far off. It is a promise even to this day, Father. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your Holy Ghost can still be poured upon your people, oh God.
