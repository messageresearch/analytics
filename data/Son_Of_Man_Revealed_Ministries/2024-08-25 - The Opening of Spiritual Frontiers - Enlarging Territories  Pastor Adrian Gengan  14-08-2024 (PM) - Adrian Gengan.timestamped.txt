[3:45] Israel saying oh that thou wouldest
[3:47] bless me indeed oh yes I like this man
[3:51] yes amen yes God doesn't come to him
[3:54] he's calling to God In Prayer but he's
[3:57] got a vision for his life I'm like the
[4:00] prophet I like a man with vision he says
[4:03] oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed
[4:06] and enlarge my Coast amen that word
[4:08] means to enlarge my territory yes
[4:11] amen and that thine hand might be with
[4:14] me and that thou wouldest Keep Me From
[4:18] Evil amen and that it may not grieve
[4:22] me and God granted him that which he
[4:26] requested amen hallelujah amen amen so
[4:30] this man we know found favor in the eyes
[4:32] of God Amen let's turn to Matthew 7 and:
[4:36] 7 to see how God answered his prayer
[4:39] yeah our lord Jesus will tell us how he
[4:41] answers prayer now what did the first
[4:44] thing jbz did he asked of the Lord amen
[4:49] Matthew 7:7 says ask and it shall be
[4:52] given you amen seek you shall
[4:56] find knock and it shall be opened unto
[5:00] you yes hey we're knocking on some gates
[5:03] of hell this
[5:04] evening they don't want to open we're
[5:06] going to blast it open yes amen yes Lord
[5:09] and for every one of you that ask it
[5:11] receiveth yes and he that seeketh find
[5:14] it amen and to him that knocketh it

[5:18] opened for what man is there of you whom
[5:21] if he son ask bread will he give him a
[5:24] stone or if you ask a fish will he give
[5:26] him a serpent if he then being evil know
[5:30] how to give good gifts unto your
[5:32] children how much more shall your father
[5:35] which is in heaven give good things to
[5:37] them that ask him amen so we can see how
[5:40] God answered ja's prayer there one more
[5:42] scripture then you can be seated in 1
[5:43] John chapter
[5:45] 5 now we can't go ask
[5:48] feebly we've got to ask with confidence
[5:51] amen as this next verse will tell us and
[5:55] this is the confidence that we have in
[5:57] him that we ask anything according
[5:59] according to his
[6:00] will he heareth
[6:03] us and if we know that he hear us
[6:07] whatsoever we
[6:09] ask we know that we have the petitions
[6:12] that we have desired of him amen the
[6:15] Lord had blessings to the reading of his
[6:16] word
[6:21] amen praise the Lord
[6:24] amen amen you just be still and you know
[6:28] that he is God tonight but when I'm
[6:29] saying still I don't mean don't don't
[6:31] say Amen right don't get me wrong
[6:33] Hallelujah if God is going to enlarge
[6:36] our territory I'm asking you tonight to
[6:37] make room oh yes amen hallelujah
[6:41] hallelujah amen sometimes it's not that
[6:43] we need more of the Holy Ghost we need
[6:45] to empty out ourselves yes amen we need
[6:48] to let go of our will amen and then the
[6:51] Holy Ghost can work through US amen
[6:54] hallelujah amen so everyone's at the
[6:56] post of Duty tonight amen we thank God
[6:59] for that
[7:01] amen amen hallelujah amen so we know
[7:04] that our physical lives are interwoven
[7:07] with our spiritual self we are flesh and
[7:11] we are Spirit we are flesh we are spirit
[7:16] and we are soul we are three-part being
[7:19] yes amen but we function as one unit
[7:22] amen amen if your spirit had to leave
[7:25] your body right now you'll be considered
[7:28] dead Hallelujah
[7:30] so we function as one unit amen so if we
[7:33] want to have spiritual victories in our
[7:35] lives how many wants to have spiritual
[7:36] victories in our lives this evening
[7:38] we've got to follow the Holy Ghost who
[7:40] is our leader and operate by spiritual
[7:43] laws amen because in this war that we in
[7:46] There Are Rules of
[7:48] Engagement and we've got to fight
[7:50] according to the rules amen hallelujah
[7:54] we are engaging enemy forces we are
[7:56] going Behind Enemy Lines amen amen and
[8:00] we must possess the authority of the
[8:01] father to engage in Warfare therefore we
[8:04] are seeking adoption because adoption
[8:07] places Us in Authority adoption places
[8:10] us in our sunship Authority amen amen
[8:13] hallelujah thank you Lord amen so we're
[8:17] going Behind Enemy Lines we must carry
[8:19] the authority of our father meaning we
[8:22] must carry the authority of his name yes
[8:25] amen so though we walk in the flesh we
[8:27] do not war after the flesh
[8:31] and the Bible says in Romans chapter 8
[8:33] there is no condemnation to us who are
[8:35] in Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[8:38] flesh but after the spirit amen
[8:41] amen now what are the meaning of gates
[8:45] spiritual meaning of gates we know that
[8:47] in the natural a gate is something you
[8:50] enter
[8:52] through amen so a gate can be a
[8:56] portal hallelujah amen amen and in
[8:59] infuence From Another
[9:00] World a Gateway a portal open up to us
[9:06] so gates are something we enter through
[9:09] but it is also for protection and
[9:11] defense amen the same is true
[9:13] spiritually every person has gates to
[9:16] their soul to their spirit and to their
[9:19] body amen amen if we allow Satan to
[9:22] enter through these Gates amen he will
[9:24] have a time with us amen hallelujah the
[9:27] word tells us that when we receive Jesus
[9:29] Christ we are sealed with that Holy
[9:32] Spirit of Promise meaning the holy
[9:34] spirit is our
[9:36] gate it's the gateway to our spirit amen
[9:40] and the moment we become vexed in our
[9:42] spirit with evil spirits you must know
[9:44] that something is wrong that our
[9:47] protection is gone our seal is gone amen
[9:51] so the gates to our spiritual realm are
[9:52] closed when our spirit becomes a new
[9:57] creation amen God shut the gates on the
[10:01] enemy amen that's called the Gates of
[10:03] Heaven we are protected by the word we
[10:06] are protected by the Holy Spirit we are
[10:09] protected amen by every force and every
[10:12] weapon that God has given us yes amen
[10:15] amen we will be defeated if we are not
[10:17] staying behind the Gates that's right
[10:19] Hallelujah and the prophet teaches us
[10:21] don't go on the enemy's grounds don't go
[10:24] onto its
[10:26] territory
[10:28] hallelujah amen so we know that the
[10:30] enemy according to St John chapter 10:10
[10:33] easy scripture to remember John chap
[10:35] 10:10 the enemy comes to
[10:39] steal to kill yes and Destroy so what
[10:44] does he steal first he tactic he steals
[10:47] the word Garden of Eden he steals the
[10:49] word then he can kill because the word
[10:52] is our protection amen so if he steals
[10:55] the word he can kill and once he kills
[10:57] he can destroy yeah you see he's not
[11:00] just happy with killing he wants to
[11:02] destroy the children of
[11:05] God Amen because he knows his success
[11:09] depends on us not coming to the
[11:11] manifestation of Sons and Daughters of
[11:13] God he knows if he keeps us in religion
[11:16] he knows if he keeps us just happy with
[11:18] certain portions of the world that he
[11:20] can still run his kingdom but when Sons
[11:22] and Daughters of God are coming into the
[11:24] position he knows his kingdom is over
[11:26] amen amen yes Lord amen that which she
[11:29] stole from Adam and Eve our father and
[11:31] our mother we as the Sons The
[11:34] Descendants are taking back amen because
[11:37] what was taken from them in the Garden
[11:39] of Eden we have taken it back now in
[11:41] Revelation chap 10 thank you Lord
[11:44] meaning that we have the legal Authority
[11:46] we have the title deed in our hands amen
[11:48] and when we are reading the title deed
[11:50] amen we are reading Adam saying I lost
[11:54] eternal life but I'm giving it to you
[11:56] who are there standing in Revelation 10
[11:58] amen I lost power over the Earth but I'm
[12:01] giving it to you who are taking it back
[12:03] in Revelation 10 amen I lost amen
[12:06] Dominion but I'm giving it to you my
[12:09] children who are there in Revelation 10
[12:12] amen hallelujah amen we are reading the
[12:16] title deed oh yes Hallelujah and you
[12:18] know what we are not gloomy about it we
[12:21] see our possession and we are taking
[12:23] back we are taking back Dominion we are
[12:25] taking back our family we are taking
[12:28] back our children we are taking back our
[12:30] loved ones we are saying like lot not
[12:32] one of them will be
[12:35] lost
[12:37] hallelujah amen Matthew 11:12 says the
[12:41] Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and
[12:43] the violent take it by
[12:46] force don't allow Satan's kingdom to be
[12:48] more violent than
[12:51] you amen the violent take it by
[12:55] force praise the Lord amen the prophet
[12:58] tells us
[12:59] then when all hell turns loose all
[13:02] Heaven turns loose also when you reading
[13:05] there in Revelation chapter 6 verse 8
[13:08] that under that fourth seal that was
[13:10] ride on the horse is called Death and
[13:12] All Hell Followed him don't be
[13:14] disheartened because Revelation 10 all
[13:17] of Heaven is coming down amen amen
[13:21] Heaven has a host of army it has an
[13:23] angel army yes amen that's why
[13:27] Revelation 8 there is Sil in
[13:30] heaven the battle has now come to the
[13:32] Earth yes Hallelujah the battle is hot
[13:36] and heavy and we must fight if we must
[13:39] win yes amen amen footsteps mean
[13:41] possession meaning our footsteps are not
[13:44] backward but our footsteps are forward
[13:47] amen marching on with Christian
[13:50] Soldiers amen hallelujah so Jesus tells
[13:53] us he says I tell you the truth I am the
[13:56] gate for the Sheep oh what a gate to
[13:58] have amen what a gate to have when Satan
[14:01] comes knocking at your gate he sees
[14:04] Jesus at the
[14:05] Gat amen he says all whoever come before
[14:09] me with thieves and robbers but the
[14:11] Sheep did not listen to them I am the
[14:13] gate whoever enters through me will be
[14:16] saved he will come in and go out and
[14:18] find pasture amen now how many if you
[14:21] know every time Benjamin Netanyahu comes
[14:23] and he gives a speech he has one famous
[14:26] saying Israel has a right to defend
[14:29] yourself amen how many of you heard him
[14:31] saying that you'll hear them saying time
[14:34] after time even you'll find the American
[14:36] president saying that Israel has a right
[14:38] to defend themselves how about spiritual
[14:41] Israel we have a right to defend
[14:44] ourselves amen
[14:46] hallelujah we don't have to give into
[14:48] every attack of the enemy amen so in our
[14:51] Christian Life there comes a time when
[14:53] we are called to stretch beyond our
[14:55] current boundaries our current
[14:57] territories like what's happening now we
[14:59] asking you to stretch beyond your
[15:01] message theology amen we asking you to
[15:03] open up new spiritual Frontiers
[15:07] amen amen praise the Lord and trust God
[15:11] for greater things even in your life and
[15:14] step into the fullness of his promise
[15:16] amen hallelujah so we we're looking at
[15:19] this powerful prayer from J be and we
[15:21] see there how it connects with the
[15:23] principles found in Matthew chapter 7
[15:26] and 1 John 5 talking about prayer
[15:29] these scriptures are revealing that God
[15:31] is willing and able to expand our
[15:33] spiritual territory when we seek him
[15:36] with faith and Alignment to his will
[15:38] amen
[15:40] amen
[15:42] amen now Jaz is not a popular
[15:46] name we don't know much about it other
[15:48] than these few verses he's not spoken
[15:51] about
[15:53] much so jabz amen is
[15:57] somebody the B declares he more
[16:00] honorable than his
[16:04] Brethren meaning he's not somebody of
[16:06] high
[16:07] rank he's not notable amongst the
[16:11] Kings
[16:14] Hallelujah but the Bible is saying he
[16:16] was more honorable than his
[16:19] Brethren despite his name name meaning
[16:22] sorrow but jabus sought God's blessing
[16:24] with a fervent heart he said oh that
[16:27] thou wouldest Bless Me In did and
[16:29] enlarge my Coast
[16:32] amen amen I'm asking
[16:35] you how about we have a concern for our
[16:40] lives how about we be a man of vision
[16:44] amen amen don't just say the prophet
[16:46] says it this way don't just say oh ever
[16:49] what will be in life will be he says no
[16:51] do something about it amen you're a God
[16:54] of the earth you are given dominion over
[16:57] the Earth
[16:59] set the course for your life amen amen
[17:03] purpose in your heart that I will follow
[17:05] the word of God yes amen I tell you even
[17:10] territories in your natural life you can
[17:13] expand that's right because not only was
[17:16] jabus talking spiritually enlarge my
[17:19] spiritual borders yes he's talking about
[17:22] material things here as
[17:24] well amen
[17:26] amen the person that sitting on your
[17:29] territory maybe in the form of your
[17:32] promotion maybe sitting in your position
[17:35] but God can extend your borders am God
[17:39] can extend your territory yes Hallelujah
[17:42] but it's according to your faith and I
[17:45] can ask for
[17:46] you you be J and you ask God yes you
[17:50] have confidence that he's your father
[17:52] amen I can pray for you sure amen but if
[17:56] you are a son and daughter of God how
[17:58] how about you pray and trust God
[18:02] hallelujah he wants to give it to you
[18:04] more than you desire it so jabus prayer
[18:07] wasn't just only about material
[18:09] expansion but about the growth amen so
[18:11] remember he's asking for the expansion
[18:13] because once you gain territory you gain
[18:18] influence
[18:21] Hallelujah once you gain influence you
[18:23] can have an
[18:25] impact yes
[18:29] amen and then you can truly fulfill
[18:30] God's purpose for your life I don't like
[18:33] things to be dry I don't like things to
[18:36] be Barren I don't like things to be just
[18:39] enough I want a god of more than enough
[18:42] I want a God who does exceedingly
[18:44] abundantly above all that we can ever
[18:46] ask or think the prophet teaches us to
[18:49] ask God for big
[18:51] things so if we ask him for big things
[18:54] and we want him to give to us abundantly
[18:57] where as his sons must reflect his
[18:59] character and we must be a people who
[19:01] give in abundance
[19:03] amen amen praise the Lord remember now
[19:07] as Christians we can't live selfish
[19:08] lives the Bible Propet tells us that
[19:11] eternal life is living for others which
[19:13] means if we value eternal life we'll
[19:15] Place more value on the other person and
[19:17] give even though we require it we'll
[19:19] give something to them because we know
[19:21] that eternal life is living for others
[19:23] and we know how a law works in the
[19:25] kingdom of God that when you give it
[19:27] will come back pressed down
[19:29] shaken together and running
[19:31] over you know at you right what happened
[19:34] she paid Tiding
[19:35] $20 the prophet was actually at a house
[19:38] to give it back to
[19:40] her yeah you go read the story he said I
[19:44] know she's so
[19:47] poor and he said I was going back back
[19:49] to give it to her and he says the Lord
[19:51] spoke to him yes and he said don't do
[19:54] that amen why there's a reward attached
[19:57] to everything you get
[19:59] you can't sww into this Kingdom and not
[20:01] be blessed this is an eternal law of the
[20:04] kingdom of God if denominational world
[20:07] have tapped into that yeah and they are
[20:09] living off
[20:11] it they're basically farming on your
[20:13] land yes how about we be like Mal and
[20:16] say we want the land back
[20:18] am how about we say every promise in the
[20:21] book is mine
[20:23] amen amen praise the Lord right so we
[20:28] must live selfish Liv just for ourselves
[20:29] and my family amen we must be giving
[20:33] people you must be so giving and so
[20:35] blessing people amen that your life is
[20:38] one of
[20:40] abundance
[20:42] amen you find people don't like to give
[20:44] Thanksgiving to the
[20:46] Lord you know every place got a a
[20:48] culture or tradition of the way they
[20:50] give thanks right so it's diff it
[20:52] differs across the nations of the
[20:56] Earth but you'll find some people can
[20:58] never give thanks to God if we are
[21:00] saying okay in our form you know how we
[21:02] give thanks when last did we give thanks
[21:06] when last we make a public declaration
[21:08] that the Lord had blessed me and I want
[21:10] to give thanks to the Lord amen and and
[21:12] if I want to bless people amen I'm going
[21:14] to bless his people hallelujah no but
[21:17] now what happens is we find how we can
[21:20] just satisfy us four and no
[21:23] more there's no blessing attached to
[21:26] them Hallelujah
[21:29] amen but when you can say I want to live
[21:31] a life of abundance Lord amen amen the
[21:34] Christian Life is an Abundant Life
[21:37] Hallelujah if God gives us so
[21:39] freely amen the Bible says freely you
[21:42] receive freely you give in fact the
[21:45] Bible says it is more blessed to give
[21:48] than to receive
[21:50] hallelujah amen I was supposed to be
[21:52] stuck on that point but I think someone
[21:55] is selfish
[21:56] you say Lord is it me
[21:59] maybe it's me I don't know Hallelujah
[22:02] because you know we preach from the pit
[22:03] to the Pew
[22:06] Hallelujah so our desire should be for a
[22:09] greater reach a greater impact a greater
[22:12] influence in the spiritual
[22:14] realm amen that's right not for self
[22:18] Glory now but to fulfill God's kingdom
[22:20] purposes am amen like jabas we must
[22:23] approach god with a sincere desire for
[22:25] his Blessing recognizing that every good
[22:28] gift comes from from above
[22:30] amen as we ask God to enlarge our
[22:33] territory we are asking him to increase
[22:35] our capacity to
[22:37] serve to make a difference for his
[22:40] kingdom can you see that's not a selfish
[22:43] asking we are asking him to bless us so
[22:46] it to increase our capacity to serve the
[22:50] kingdom amen now Matthew here we read in

[31:13] king
[31:15] hey and don't be afraid to tell your
[31:17] dream to people Joseph was not ashamed
[31:20] to tell his dream to
[31:22] people it looks impossible for him to be
[31:24] the ruler of Egypt but the moment moment
[31:28] he spoke his
[31:30] dream he activated Mark
[31:33] 11:23 a man who believes his own
[31:37] word
[31:39] amen praise the
[31:42] Lord as long as you keep the dream
[31:45] silent you don't activate spiritual
[31:48] Frontiers you don't put the laws into
[31:51] motion but the moment that word is
[31:54] released from your mouth by faith and
[31:56] you believe it you start to activate the
[31:59] promise of God
[32:02] Amen maybe you don't even have a degree
[32:04] where you
[32:06] are but you want the highest
[32:09] position maybe one second in

[32:39] God the Bible says he sets up
[32:42] Kings and he takes them down he controls
[32:46] the nations of the earth amen he even
[32:49] calls Pharaoh his servant yeah but
[32:52] Pharaoh thought he was a mighty
[32:54] ruler hey Pharaoh didn't even want to be
[32:57] so hard the Bible says God had in these
[33:00] right right don't play with my God
[33:06] Amen so jabz also prayed for God's
[33:10] presence he knew that to live large for
[33:12] God it was going to take more than his
[33:14] own strength it was going to take God's
[33:16] power in his life to accomplish his
[33:20] dream
[33:23] Amen in Ephesians 3 and: 20 it says God
[33:27] is able to do exceeding abundantly above
[33:30] all that we could ever ask or

[33:42] your borders are small you don't have
[33:43] much to
[33:44] protect
[33:46] amen praise the Lord so jabz knew that
[33:49] God's power and God's presence and God's

[34:31] the End of the Road God will be faithful
[34:33] you quit your doubting give over and
[34:36] give up and let
[34:38] God he said I'll not give you the land
[34:40] in one year but if I give you the whole
[34:42] thing in a year the wild beast will come
[34:45] in and consume you but little by little

[35:26] you move in and take over over isn't
[35:28] that what we've been seeing amen we're
[35:31] taking spiritual Frontiers little by
[35:33] little because if God opens up the
[35:35] entire Gates of Hell

[35:40] condition to be able to handle
[35:43] it basically you've got to be Jesus on

[47:09] with the Holy
[47:10] Ghost God let the spirit of God and pour
[47:13] it out on them and soaked his old being
[47:17] full I want that now I want my old being

[47:24] I want soul to be soaked amen amen
[47:27] listen what he says now it's poured out
[47:30] on them they soak their whole being he
[47:33] says then he can really shove out into
[47:35] the devil's territory without looking
[47:37] right or left that's what the believer
[47:39] is he's softhearted and God just pours
[47:42] him full of divine love then he can
[47:44] embrace the Divine judgment that sent of
[47:48] God Amen praise the Lord you see Samson
[47:51] did good he was a great man until he
[47:55] went into the devil's territory
[47:57] he left his own territory he went into
[48:00] the devil's
[48:01] territory praise the Lord Samson Samson
[48:04] began to
[48:05] flirt he was flirting with Philistine
[48:09] girls he says similar to what the church
[48:12] did
[48:13] today amen it got after unbelievers
[48:16] began to flirt with unbelievers that's
[48:18] where we made our great one of the
[48:19] greatest mistakes is when the church
[48:21] began to do things that wasn't right it
[48:25] began to keep like Samson B company amen
[48:28] he says Samson as long he was in the
[48:30] company of the Lord's people he did all
[48:32] right but when he got to flirting with
[48:34] Bad Company then he got in trouble and
[48:36] that's the way it is with the church
[48:39] when the church followed reverently and
[48:41] daily after the leading of the spirit
[48:43] God blessed them and miracles signs and
[48:45] wonders follow the church but when it
[48:47] began to keep Bad Company with the world
[48:50] one of the worst things it's done and
[48:52] the first things it's done is began to
[48:54] organize breaking up Fellowship among
[48:56] Believers because they found out that
[48:59] nations were
[49:01] organized praise the Lord
[49:03] am he says man want they compare they
[49:06] want to copy want to be like the
[49:08] world he says they to make make a
[49:12] success they they want to make
[49:14] themselves a success now listen to what
[49:16] the prophet says we can never be a
[49:18] success doing anything the world does
[49:21] that's
[49:22] right we can only be successful if we
[49:25] follow after to God's step
[49:27] and the way God's way of doing
[49:30] things we can never be by patting after
[49:33] the
[49:34] world he says now he's giving an example
[49:37] if a cigarette company has met their
[49:39] great success by television and the beer
[49:42] and The Whisky crowds has made their
[49:43] great success through the contribution
[49:46] of Television that's no sign that the
[49:48] church shall make its success by
[49:52] television amen this is the message a
[49:54] deceive Church by the world
[49:57] amen he says the success of the church
[50:00] lies within the preaching of the Gospel
[50:02] of the power of God and the
[50:04] demonstration of the spirit am we cannot
[50:06] say because that television does such
[50:08] and such for the cigarette company he
[50:11] says we do not have any Scripture to try
[50:13] and compare with them
[50:15] people right now listen this is very
[50:18] important as long as we do we may draw
[50:22] great numbers of people through using
[50:24] that right but but that's not what God
[50:27] ordained us to do as long as we do he
[50:31] says we might we think because we all
[50:35] colors flying eye great organizations
[50:37] great colorful things to take place that
[50:39] it success he says we are dying daily on
[50:42] our feet spiritually speaking if we
[50:46] stood 10 million strong this morning and
[50:49] the Holy Spirit wasn't with us we do
[50:52] well to stand 10 strong with the Holy
[50:55] Spirit amen you see why it's not in the
[51:00] numbers maybe we can get 200 people in
[51:04] here but he says in the 200 maybe all
[51:08] will fall spiritually fles he says I'd
[51:11] rather have te strong with the Holy
[51:13] Ghost we cannot compare with the world
[51:17] Amen praise the
[51:22] Lord amen let's leave it there let's
[51:24] stand together give God praise amen
[51:26] hallelujah
[51:27] let's
