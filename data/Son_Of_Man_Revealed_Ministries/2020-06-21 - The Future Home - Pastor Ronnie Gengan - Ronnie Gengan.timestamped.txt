[1:43] rumors of war taking place right now but
[1:46] I think it was glossary right on the on
[1:51] the Chinese and Indian border of India
[1:54] right it's a very remote place nobody
[1:59] living there but it's a border of China
[2:01] and in India and they got the the
[2:06] soldiers obey on the Chinese side and
[2:08] they got the Indians of the Indian side
[2:10] and some of a
[2:13] Chinese came with Alberto to the border
[2:15] of the epeans there and they started
[2:17] having a fights fights and fights and
[2:22] everything 20 Indian diet 20 Indian

[2:42] nuclear weapons they got much as the
[2:46] Chinese population of a 1 billion and
[2:50] they're you know they're gonna try and
[2:51] solve this you know to chromatically not
[2:55] getting too warm things like this but
[2:57] what I'm saying is fighting there right
[2:59] on the border right and other places
[3:01] around the world fighting killing a
[3:04] notice which taking place and we know
[3:08] the Bible says always there for me so I
[3:47] [Music]
[3:49] mean because Jesus so once it for all
[6:03] but now he's gonna take this out here I
[6:05] was going to make it a full place and
[6:07] then where is the promise of his coming
[6:09] you know substrate creation everything
[6:11] seems to be the same
[6:15] how blinded are they even though a lot
[6:19] of things take place in see creation say
[6:23] so they will not agree the gospel if the
[6:25] speaking the gospel yeah and the
[6:27] regularly being is the same there's no
[6:29] changes and and always see they don't
[6:31] wanna cleaver
[6:32] you know the geez
[6:34] escape down and reveal the earth and all
[6:36] this thing hmm
[6:37] redemption see and they want to live
[6:41] their life man see but God is coming us
[6:44] if it's worth it is worth it up
[6:46] once he destroyed it by water hmm there
[6:50] was a flood and the Bible tells us and
[6:54] people were we can continually amen even
[6:56] though we can an ungodly and they're
[6:59] unrighteous right and the Moses and Noah
[7:04] found grace in the eyes of the Lord amen
[7:06] and God said okay let me think no other
[7:08] start afraid you and the IFS Latvia but
[7:11] we would all agree that but the proof is
[7:15] that the father hath on the mountains of
[7:20] when the attackee and scientists can go
[7:26] check their the rock said and do carbon
[7:29] dating and all singing they could see
[7:30] evidence that there was a flood Libya
[7:32] and the Bible tells us the whole earth
[7:35] was flooded amen and all those people
[7:39] that didn't want to know was missing
[7:40] they all perished
[7:42] hmm only those people that came back and
[7:45] God won't start with you was Noah and
[7:48] his family
[7:49] amen and God started to get right and
[7:52] then we find you know after that people
[7:56] got into the same rut again sinning
[7:59] living their lives see the more I
[8:02] acknowledge God see but now he says well
[8:06] you know and this is one set for all is
[8:10] going to burn up all sin been upon
[8:13] corruption they enough all the makeup of
[8:17] this earth amen and he's gone to prepare
[8:24] a place for us amen amen
[8:26] and then we gonna be living in the city
[8:30] Christina marjoram hmm amen amen
[8:34] if it's City when the ladies alike amen
[8:37] amen
[8:38] so that's a place for us we will find
[8:41] the scriptures over there right so why
[8:44] is it going so wrong that the process
[8:47] the head goes to three stages water
[8:50] baptism comes through the blood
[8:53] sanctification of Jesus was here hmm
[8:56] blood fell upon beer and then the fire
[8:59] baptism
[9:00] amen amen three stages like we go
[9:04] through those stages the fire baptism is
[9:08] already ghost hmm see you gotta come
[9:10] through those three stages water blood
[9:14] fire
[9:15] amen so it's gone through those who
[9:18] stated the one stage is waiting for is
[9:21] fire see so why is he taking so long
[9:25] the Bible says God is long-suffering hey
[9:29] man he's not willing that any should
[9:31] perish but des embrace idea but beloved
[9:36] be not ignorant of this one thing that
[9:39] one day is with the Lord as a thousand
[9:42] years and a thousand years is one day so
[9:46] God is not in the tiny limitless us
[9:49] thousand years is like one day - it says
[9:56] here the long-suffering of God says I'm
[10:29] greedy yes amen twenty years and it did
[10:35] one of the Pens it don't want to tell

[19:15] but with some scriptures they ran time
[19:20] so we got all these things coming up on
[19:22] the face of the earth so we're looking
[19:25] for new heavens and the new earth so the
[19:27] front said God doesn't destroy there are
[19:30] all that you know the strange world of
[19:32] the earth the destroy all sin and
[19:35] godliness every sickness some people be

[20:04] everyone comes down to earth mmm see so
[20:08] he doesn't it doesn't touch the
[20:10] framework of the earth and we know
[20:13] they're there tectonic atomic plates but
[20:17] the movement you can you get earthquakes
[20:18] about all those things will be perfect
[20:22] they'll be perfectly aligned again but
[20:26] number two super excited cause the
[20:28] earthquakes
[20:28] he doesn't destroy the framework of the
[20:32] earth hmm
[20:33] see you work on the same earth amen
[20:36] so we go back we come back to live on
[20:39] the same earth praise the Lord how do
[20:42] you like for that amen
[20:44] words would beloved verse 14 seeing that
[20:47] you look for such things be diligent
[20:50] that you may be found a few min peace
[20:53] without spot and blameless I'll be of us
[20:58] can say this what I have without Spartan
[20:59] ladies the reason you must be without
[21:05] spot we must be blameless how many of us
[21:14] can say a lot of the lot of spots and
[21:16] I've been through for many things I've
[21:19] number one I have got lot of spots basic
[21:29] things see how we treat one another
[21:34] are we christ-like are we long-suffering
[21:38] and before bear with one another
[21:42] somebody make a mistake you dare to
[21:46] write the most but when the woman was
[21:48] caught in the very act of adultery they
[21:50] brought it to Jesus huh whether the the
[21:56] world was Torah but the one who can
[22:02] forgive sins was there
[22:04] amen now welcome deserve the hut and we
[22:08] saw all this guide to st. Oliver guilty
[22:14] and he waited waited he left town he
[22:22] wrote something on the ground a Teddy
[22:25] said fine which one of you is without
[22:28] sin cast the first stone
[22:30] well mr. MELAS but before somebody taken
[22:35] in the fall or something we are ready to
[22:37] rust about we're ready to tell them
[22:40] often give them a piece of our mind
[22:48] [Music]
[22:50] [Laughter]
[22:54] [Music]
[23:06] people cannot be wrong suffering the
[23:10] Bible says without spot without blemish
[23:12] I would like to write somebody off see
[23:20] whether the believers are not believers
[23:23] see that gives anybody I will all
[23:28] suffering that he is long-suffering lord
[23:32] have prayed for them replace them maybe
[23:35] maybe in a family the pellets made me
[23:38] for the children are they long-suffering
[23:41] don't give up on the children see there
[23:46] were the disabled children and they they
[23:50] can't the persevere and pray you know
[23:54] down but he said you must be without
[23:57] spot or blemish verse 15 and I can't
[24:02] that the long-suffering of our body
[24:04] salvation why you want to be long
[24:06] suffering because of salvation he wants
[24:10] people where salvation amen
[24:13] so long-suffering is given them enough
[24:15] time through
[24:17] yes the gospel of the preach now there's
[24:23] no PA because they ask Jesus what shall
[24:25] there be so the gospel must be preached
[24:27] to all their double yes then shall come
[24:30] so who's gonna be able so the reason why
[24:34] some people don't believe this at the
[24:35] end of the world they don't understand
[24:37] how it's gonna end
[24:39] but he's where I am exactly of God says
[24:42] he's here he's going to burn up here
[24:44] everything is going to change it and
[24:46] make it a safe place so they can't
[24:48] understand all the earth is gonna hit
[24:50] but it's all recorded in the world of
[24:52] book but and I found in the
[24:56] long-suffering of our Lord is salvation
[24:59] even as a beloved fall according to the
[25:03] wisdom given a fail a little not heal
[25:05] and also it all is a pistol spitting in
[25:09] them these things in which are some
[25:12] things hard to be understood which they
[25:17] that are unlearned and unstable missile
[25:21] see unleaded unstable we don't
[25:24] understand they wrestle against these
[25:27] things and they do also as the duels are
[25:32] the other scriptures unto the old
[25:35] destruction the old destruction seen as
[25:43] people fighting the word to me
[25:44] there's people fighting Christianity we
[25:47] get the Atheist fight II don't know god
[25:51] never creates a barrier and everything
[25:54] is evolved from ethnic banging and there
[25:56] was no intelligence they want to see see
[26:00] then they live fighting and whistling
[26:02] against the things of God but the world
[26:06] of money so suppose if they believe the
[26:08] Word of God he says Jennison in the
[26:11] beginning God created heavens at the
[26:13] earth hmm but they don't believe the
[26:17] Word of God or Moses or kids and you get
[26:21] all the other guys disputing the go
[26:23] there and the New Testament alone and
[26:27] therefore these scriptures but you know
[26:29] we don't believe they right into a beam
[26:32] by the bottle self man who by the holy
[26:35] ghost wrote amen
[26:38] what use method men wrote the
[26:41] luminometer John and Peter Paul and all
[26:44] that they are men they wrote that's
[26:47] right and then one group are the Holy
[26:50] Ghost right amen
[26:53] see verse 17 he therefore beloved seeing
[27:00] you know these things before see you
[27:03] know you know that beforehand beware
[27:08] lest you also being led away with the
[27:11] error of the weekend fall from your own
[27:14] steadfastness and they tell you know all
[27:22] this self things are wrong in the base
[27:24] it is wrong that the Prophet is wrong
[27:26] some people are weak to perform as many
[27:30] have done we've got to go to listen to
[27:33] all these people that are you know
[27:35] breeding an for super against the world
[27:38] we must stay with aware of the message
[27:40] Jack none of me a lot of people hate the
[27:44] message now in the message they're
[27:46] against it see and some people are we do
[27:50] these people you're going to follow and
[27:53] people can be influenced with that they
[27:57] can solve so quickly save even entice
[28:00] expands then I'm going to do it it's
[28:04] what they are saying
[28:06] see but grow in grace and in the
[28:10] knowledge of forward seven Jesus Christ
[28:12] so he'll be glory for now and forever

[29:22] Word of God amen they didn't believe the
[29:25] world they will go in and we have a
[29:30] promise and he's particularly making
[29:33] reference to the message a man who's

[31:14] what's going to happen some fifty the
[31:17] mighty God even the Lord spoken and call
[31:20] the earth from the rising of the Sun and
[31:24] to the going down the earth out of Zion
[31:27] the perfection of beauty go to China our
[31:31] God shall come and shall not keep silent
[31:34] a fire shall devour before him a fire
[31:40] and it shall be very tempted round about
[31:44] him each are called to the Airman's
[31:47] from above and to the earth that he may
[31:51] judge his people gather my sense
[31:54] together how to be those that I've made
[31:57] a covenant would be by sacrifice and the
[32:00] Evan shall declare his righteousness for
[32:02] God for God is Jack himself racer and
[32:11] fire will go before him and I give
[32:15] Mississippi he'll be waiting over there
[32:18] so you find even in that time people
[32:22] were so thinking I bring it this
[32:24] bringing sacrifice you know God requires
[32:26] a sacrifice
[32:27] let's go and sacrifice and God said you
[32:30] came to time you got fed up looking I
[32:34] thought you don't only want your
[32:35] sacrifices see it become a routine thing
[32:42] confident didn't even come in the
[32:44] sacrifice right verse 14 same sub 50
[32:50] offer on the work Thanksgiving and paint
[32:53] the walls onto the Voskhod and call upon
[32:56] me the day of trouble I will do thee and
[32:59] that thou shalt glorify me but under the
[33:02] wicked god say what has done to do to
[33:07] declare my sketches all that thou shalt
[33:10] speak
[33:11] covenant in develop seeing the interest
[33:15] instruction and custard my words behind
[33:18] me so I see y'all can take my word
[33:22] I've got nothing to show about my about
[33:24] word but statuettes see the running
[33:26] water bring sacrifice sacrifice but
[33:29] you're not living by my word no God
[33:33] wanted them to be faithful but this
[33:36] about God wanna sacrifice a bridge yet
[33:38] sacrifice event but core according to
[33:41] the day of trouble I will do thee and
[33:45] thou shalt glorify me friends alone so
[33:49] let's go to Revelation 21 that up we let
[33:52] us look toward God said what is going to
[33:54] do 2nd Peter and if you leave there I
[33:58] read the book of James James they
[34:02] believe River exactly what Peter was
[34:06] right again and James rose parallel to
[34:11] what Peter book they both agree that he
[34:14] spoke about the heavens and earth being
[34:16] on fire
[34:16] how to say and how its reserved ungodly
[34:19] bed and the angels that sinned but
[34:23] judgment is reserved for them see if we
[34:27] got retains its well eventually family
[34:30] what Peter preached and then about the
[34:34] Lord coming day right so he says he had
[34:37] nominations 21 and I saw a new heaven
[34:40] and a new earth so what is new heaven
[34:43] and a new earth God renovated it amen
[34:49] see he was preparing and he comes down
[34:54] but for the first heaven and the first
[34:57] Earth were passed away and there was no
[35:01] more sea right so this is where the
[35:06] brahmic preaching in the spicy well what
[35:09] God shall is missing it's actually three
[35:11] and a half holes what serves three and a
[35:17] half hours but was this funny and the
[35:22] Prophet said the earth that
[35:26] there was no but the Bible says in
[35:31] that spot of Jerusalem in Israel that we
[35:34] know see and the city will be 15 at the
[35:37] trial square the length the breadth and
[35:41] the height 1,500 miles and then he says
[35:46] he he he made in the dark in America
[35:48] he says he's asked the size of America
[35:52] the city will be there greatly further
[35:55] the pushing up amen
[35:58] a great big mountain and the law will be
[36:01] right up on the console amen and alga
[36:06] this the world superboots and the gates
[36:08] of there the twelve apostels the veins
[36:12] on each of the gate the Foundation's
[36:13] over there God give a total description
[36:17] so they reckon he says that another way
[36:20] would see that we don't we'll see there
[36:22] so you be our from the state of America
[36:25] right now it's not you can't measure
[36:28] that area because the sea and everything
[36:31] is a visitor agency and this rail is one
[36:34] of the smallest possible plane but he
[36:37] says be fifteen hundred mile square
[36:40] anyway that virtually they read about
[36:43] the scripture bales and I John saw the
[36:47] holy city New Jerusalem coming down from
[36:50] God out of heaven prepared as a bride
[36:53] adorned for her husband and heard a
[36:56] great voice out of heaven saying no the
[36:59] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[37:02] will dwell with them and they shall be
[37:04] his people and God himself shall be with
[37:07] them and be their God
[37:08] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[37:11] their eyes and there shall be no more
[37:13] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[37:16] shall there be any more pain for the
[37:17] former things are passed away and he'll
[37:20] accept upon the throne said behold I
[37:22] make all things new and he said unto me
[37:25] write for these words are true and
[37:29] faithful
[37:30] praise Allah so Allah tells us la comes
[37:35] down to earth he says
[37:38] grace amen God every one of these people
[37:43] praise Lord so we look at it what was in
[37:46] the act of God if the people God was
[37:49] hello him he looked all alone then he
[37:55] made man in His image
[37:57] praise Allah okay he did that to show
[38:03] the attributes that he had to be Savior
[38:07] to be father to be ela and many many
[38:12] other things so God's done working with
[38:15] man now he comes from the wood men or
[38:22] New Jerusalem comes down from heaven he
[38:29] comes and with us and he says he will be
[38:33] our wallet we shall be should see what
[38:37] had to be done
[38:38] amen to be united with man again he was
[38:43] not to be just living alone and he had
[38:46] all the power and everything else and
[38:48] all that the universe in front of him
[38:50] there didn't he come to Valley on earth
[38:55] amen
[38:56] and that we know was Satan over the
[38:58] stability
[39:00] Satan is destroyed he's cast into the
[39:04] lake of fire is completely destroyed see
[39:11] but we promised a new souls ie Journal

[39:26] body will not the soul the soul is
[39:32] eternal

[39:39] heavenly body for the soul to live in
