[2:46] hallelujah wonderful God
[2:49] hallelujah amen you're glad to be back
[2:51] in the house of the Lord amen a double
[2:54] portion amen it's good to receive a
[2:56] double portion amen from the Lord when
[2:59] know when we know that he wants to speak
[3:02] yes amen and we know that the Bible says
[3:04] as you see the days fast approaching we
[3:07] should gather more often amen and these
[3:09] are not just services that are just said
[3:12] just for any coincidence or any ordinary
[3:15] reason but amen it's the Lord that's
[3:17] moving us the Lord that's drawing us
[3:19] closer to him amen we can turn to First
[3:23] Corinthians chapter
[3:26] 11 amen amen hallelujah amen once again
[3:30] I like to thank our pastor for the
[3:31] opportunity to share the word of the
[3:33] Lord amen and I pray you be blessed in
[3:36] the house of the Lord amen
[3:39] amen amen now you know that in the
[3:41] morning amen we heard the message that
[3:44] was preached amen and it was preached
[3:46] out of first Corin Corinthians chapter
[3:50] 11 amen and this is how I can tell you
[3:52] that amen when Pastor decided to have a
[3:55] second service to out of the ordinary it
[3:58] wasn't just Pastor out of his own desire
[4:00] asking that but it was God leading God
[4:03] orchestrating
[4:04] Amen I had my notes prepared last night
[4:08] and this is the exact same scripture
[4:10] that my message was based on when Pastor
[4:13] opened the scripture in the morning I
[4:15] started to get
[4:16] anxious and I was saying Lord please let
[4:18] him close quickly I don't want him to go
[4:20] into any more of my
[4:22] message amen but it's to show you amen
[4:25] that how can two different people in two
[4:27] different areas tap into the same
[4:29] anointing amen amen why because the Holy
[4:32] Spirit wants to lead us in a certain
[4:33] direction and the Holy Spirit is trying
[4:36] to tell us something and when that
[4:37] happens we got to pay attention amen
[4:39] amen so we don't miss what he's trying
[4:41] to do yes amen so I hope I don't steal
[4:44] any more of brother Joshua's
[4:47] message amen amen you'll see some of the
[4:50] things that we say here was exactly word
[4:52] for word spoken in the morning and I was
[4:54] thinking then should I change my message
[4:56] and then the holy spirit said no he's
[4:58] fixing to do something something there's
[5:00] a reason why he's allowing this so he
[5:02] wants us to stay in this amen so
[5:04] Hallelujah let's just be blessed in his
[5:06] presence thank you amen reading from
[5:09] verse one be a followers of me even as I
[5:12] also am of Christ I Praise You Brethren
[5:16] that you remember me in all things and
[5:18] keep the ordinances as I delivered them
[5:21] unto you but I would have you know that
[5:23] the head of every man is
[5:25] Christ and the head of the woman is the
[5:28] man amen and the head of Christ is God
[5:32] yes every man praying or prophesying
[5:34] having his head covered dishonor his
[5:37] head but every woman that prayeth or
[5:39] prophesied with her head uncovered
[5:42] dishonor her head for that is even all
[5:45] one as if she were
[5:47] shaven for if the woman be not covered
[5:50] let her also be sha and the prophet said
[5:52] that word Shan means to Shear it means
[5:54] to cut but if it be a shame for a woman
[5:57] to be Shor or shaven let her be covered
[5:59] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[6:02] head for as much as he is the image and
[6:05] glory of God so man is the image and
[6:07] glory of God Amen but the woman is the
[6:10] glory of the man we heard that this
[6:12] morning
[6:14] amen amen so this morning we heard that
[6:17] the glory of the man is the woman
[6:20] woman amen but today tonight now we're
[6:23] going to talk about the glory of the
[6:25] woman for the man is not of the woman
[6:28] but the woman of the man neither was the
[6:31] Man created for the woman but the woman
[6:33] for the man for this cause ought the
[6:36] woman to have power on her head because
[6:38] of the
[6:39] Angels nevertheless neither is The Man
[6:42] Without The Woman neither the woman
[6:44] without the man in the Lord for as the
[6:47] woman is of the man even so is the man
[6:50] also by the woman all things of God
[6:53] judging yourselves is it comely that a
[6:56] woman pray unto God uncovered do not
[6:58] even nature itself teach you that if a
[7:01] man have long hair it is a shame unto
[7:03] him but if a woman have long hair it is
[7:06] a glory to her for her hair is given her
[7:09] for a covering so when a woman has long
[7:12] hair and doesn't cut her hair it's a
[7:13] glory unto her amen then Paul goes on to
[7:17] say but if any man seem to be
[7:18] contentious we have no such custom
[7:21] neither the Churches of God Amen may the
[7:23] Lord add His blessings to the reading of
[7:25] his word amen you may be seated
[7:27] amen now we know that the male types the
[7:30] Lord Jesus Christ yes and the female
[7:33] always types the church the wife of the
[7:35] Lord Jesus Christ amen in verse seven
[7:38] when we read there and I'm going to try
[7:40] and go very quickly because I I've also
[7:42] got to give time to brother Joshua as
[7:44] well but thankfully the foundation was
[7:47] already laid this morning so I don't
[7:48] have to labor on any certain points I
[7:50] can go very quickly so verse 7even says
[7:53] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[7:56] head for as much as he is the image and
[7:58] Glory of of God right so man is the
[8:02] image and glory of God and man types
[8:05] Jesus Christ the book of col Colossians
[8:08] chapter 1 says the son is the image of
[8:11] the invisible God the firstborn over all
[8:14] creation for in him all things were
[8:17] created things in heaven on Earth
[8:20] visible and invisible whether Thrones of
[8:23] powers or rulers or authorities all
[8:26] things have been created through him and
[8:28] for him
[8:30] he is before all things and in him all
[8:32] things hold together and he is the head
[8:35] of the body the church he is the
[8:38] beginning and the firstborn from among
[8:40] the dead so that in everything he might
[8:43] have the
[8:44] supremacy so we see that the son is the
[8:47] image of the invisible God Amen just
[8:49] like how man is the image and the glory
[8:52] of God he's typing Jesus Christ who is
[8:54] the image and glory of the invisible God
[8:57] who has made flesh and manifested here
[8:59] on the earth you see God told Moses that
[9:02] no man can see my face and live but
[9:05] Jesus now could come and say no man had
[9:07] seen the father only I have seen the
[9:09] father and I declaim unto you why
[9:12] because Jesus himself is the image and
[9:14] Glory that was expressed in a body of
[9:16] Flesh
[9:18] yes yes but for the woman she has to
[9:21] come under Authority and a headship and
[9:24] when she comes under this headship of a
[9:26] man and under the authority of a man and
[9:29] she Honors that she honors her
[9:32] head amen so we know the Bible tells us
[9:35] when she does not cut her hair she
[9:37] honors her head yes yes and in so doing
[9:41] her very Act of honoring her head and
[9:43] being under the authority of her head by
[9:46] letting her hair grow out this is her
[9:48] glory yes amen so her glory is being
[9:51] under subjection and being under the
[9:53] authority of our headship yes now Jesus
[9:56] Christ we know types the sunlight and
[9:59] the church types the Moonlight and we
[10:01] know that the moon does not have its own
[10:03] light but the moon reflects the same
[10:06] light as the sun in the absence of the
[10:08] sun Hallelujah so if Christ is the image
[10:11] of the invisible God if Christ the image
[10:14] and glory of God being
[10:16] expressed amen and if the church
[10:18] reflects the same light in the absence
[10:21] of Christ physically here on the earth
[10:22] why is she reflecting she's reflecting
[10:25] the same image and glory of God now
[10:28] expressed again in human
[10:30] flesh you see God laid out his pattern
[10:32] in the Garden of
[10:34] Eden God created we know God created
[10:37] Adam
[10:38] first and in Adam was locked up Eve yes
[10:42] and God created Adam in the image of God
[10:45] Amen So Adam was reflecting the glory of
[10:48] the Lord upon the Earth yes amen
[10:50] absolutely and whilst he was reflecting
[10:53] the glory of the Lord upon the Earth
[10:54] locked up inside of him was Eve amen
[10:57] amen amen Hallelujah if you can turn to
[11:01] Genesis 1:
[11:03] 26 you see Eve was not part of the
[11:06] original creation we know that yes and
[11:08] we only know that because the prophet
[11:10] revealed that to us amen she came as a
[11:13] byproduct and now the byproduct itself
[11:15] was not the image and glory of God Adam
[11:18] was made after the image and glory of
[11:20] God Amen if you read Genesis 1: 26 it
[11:25] says and God said let us make man in our
[11:28] image after our likeness you remember we
[11:31] heard in the morning his glory is his
[11:33] character God made man after his own
[11:36] likeness his own character his own
[11:39] nature and let them have dominion over
[11:41] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[11:43] the air and the cattle and so forth so
[11:46] why did God make man in his own image in
[11:49] order for man to have dominion over the
[11:51] Earth Hallelujah so if man now wants to
[11:54] have dominion over the Earth how does he
[11:56] get there he has to come back into the
[11:57] image of the glory of the Lord because
[12:00] that is why God put man after his own
[12:02] image after his own likeness after his
[12:05] own attributes after his own nature
[12:07] because God said let there be and there
[12:09] was amen Adam could speak and it
[12:11] happened
[12:15] amen So Adam was a spirit man before he
[12:19] has made flesh right he has made in the
[12:22] image of God but then in Genesis
[12:26] 2:7 now God makes Adam into a flesh body
[12:29] he puts Adam into a flesh body amen and
[12:32] then after that in Genesis
[12:35] 2:22 then Eve was formed as well from
[12:37] the dust of the earth God took out the r
[12:39] from the side of Adam and he made Eve so
[12:43] Adam as the man was in the glory and
[12:45] image of God now coming from Spirit man
[12:48] to flesh man amen just as Jesus Christ
[12:51] who is the glory and image of God came
[12:53] from Spirit body theophany to flesh body
[12:56] amen amen and Eve not being in in the
[12:59] original glory and image of God she was
[13:02] instead made in the glory and image of
[13:04] man yes amen amen she was made in the
[13:07] glory and image of Adam that is why Adam
[13:09] could not say you are bone of my bone
[13:11] Flesh of My
[13:12] Flesh you see now and then Evena had to
[13:15] come under subjection to Adam's headship
[13:19] and when she did this this was glorious
[13:22] in the sight of God amen amen God was so
[13:25] pleased now with his family on the earth
[13:27] that every day he would come in the cool
[13:28] of the day amen and have fellowship with
[13:31] him sh Glory came down every day why
[13:34] because man was under the headship of
[13:36] God Eve was under the headship of man
[13:38] everything was working well according to
[13:41] the plan of God and when that happens sh
[13:44] Glory can come down amen yes amen but
[13:47] now they come a time when Eve was
[13:50] deceived by the
[13:53] serpent oh yes you can see now how the
[13:55] foundation was laid in the morning
[13:58] Hallelujah
[14:00] and when Eve was deceived by the serpent
[14:02] she started to dishonor her head yes we
[14:06] know what happened by a prophet amen and
[14:09] an act of adultery was committed amen
[14:12] and she Dishonored her head and when she
[14:15] Dishonored her head what does
[14:16] Corinthians tell us when a woman cuts
[14:19] her hair and dishonors her head she does
[14:21] not have any Glory she cuts off her
[14:23] glory amen so when Eve Dishonored her
[14:26] head she was cut off from her
[14:29] glory amen and now comes Eve here no no
[14:33] more Glory no power she presents this to
[14:37] Adam now many people will say Adam then
[14:40] committed sin the denominational church
[14:43] will tell you Adam then also fell Adam
[14:45] also committed the same sin he's just as
[14:48] guilty as Eve but a prophet then comes
[14:50] and tells us no Adam was not deceived
[14:53] amen we heard this in the morning amen
[14:55] Adam was not deceived he loved e so much
[14:59] and he knew that God would kill her for
[15:01] it because that's God's law amen so he
[15:04] partook of it with her to spare life now
[15:07] watch the type Eve Dishonored her head
[15:10] and left her headship and in so doing
[15:12] she was stripped of her glory yes she
[15:14] cut off her glory but Adam who was
[15:17] perfect and in the image of the
[15:19] invisible God and the glory of God he
[15:22] gave up his glory to save Eve amen amen
[15:26] hallelujah who was his own Glory as we
[15:27] had in the morning
[15:29] amen so amen when I heard this last
[15:31] night you know I was typing on my laptop
[15:33] and this inspiration fell on me and I
[15:34] was just rejoicing with it so when I
[15:36] heard Pastor say the exact same thing in
[15:37] the morning I was rejoicing amen
[15:40] hallelujah because then it's not just
[15:41] the thoughts of man but it's God
[15:43] revealing something to us you see Adam
[15:46] did not fall yes but to go after Eve he
[15:49] left his glory like Jesus Christ left
[15:51] his glory and came down to SP e
[15:54] hallelujah hallelujah because he had
[15:56] another glory in mind he wanted Eve yes
[15:59] amen hallelujah and Jesus Christ knew
[16:01] that when he is put to the grave and
[16:03] Rises up amen out of his side comes a
[16:06] spiritual Eve amen thank you Lord
[16:08] hallelujah yes Lord you say Adam sinned
[16:11] no Adam became Sinn so that Eve might be
[16:14] saved and Jesus Christ hanging on a tree
[16:18] amen became sin cursed and judged upon a
[16:20] cross so that you and I can be saved
[16:23] amen amen
[16:25] hallelujah so you see Eve had to be
[16:28] under a headship and as soon as she came
[16:30] out of a headship she lost her glory
[16:33] amen now the prophet tells us now I know
[16:36] you ladies don't like this kind of
[16:38] preaching but sister you are dead wrong
[16:40] in what you're doing the Bible forbids
[16:42] you to cut your hair God gave it for a
[16:45] covering he gave a command for you to
[16:47] wait long it is your glory when you cut
[16:50] your hair you signifi that you left the
[16:53] headship of your husband like Eve you
[16:56] walked out and went on your own you got
[16:59] the vote you took men's jobs you left
[17:01] off being Fe you see when you leave the
[17:03] headship the woman now starts to have
[17:05] her own way like Queen vasti We heard in
[17:08] the morning and the prophet says you
[17:10] ought to repent and come back to God a
[17:13] man that's ashamed to stand in the
[17:14] pulpit and tell God's truth when he
[17:18] knows that it's an immoral thing now
[17:19] watch the kind of words the prophet uses
[17:22] he says it's an immoral thing for a
[17:24] woman to cut her
[17:27] hair
[17:29] the Bible a man's got a right to leave
[17:31] his wife and give her a divorce when she
[17:34] cuts her hair so you say it's not
[17:36] serious the prophet says a man is
[17:38] entitled to divorce his wife if she cuts
[17:40] a hair why because when she cuts a hair
[17:43] she dishonors her
[17:45] head and the prophet said no
[17:47] dishonorable woman should be lived with
[17:49] because she cuts off her
[17:52] glory see it's a serious thing now I
[17:56] don't want you to focus so much on the
[17:57] natural l I'm I'm trying to type it out
[17:59] with the
[18:01] spiritual and when the church has cut
[18:04] off her glory notice I said when the
[18:06] church has cut off her glory because in
[18:09] the book of Acts God sent his glory down
[18:12] amen the Holy Ghost fill the church amen
[18:15] so the glory came down in the book of
[18:16] Acts it was a glorious Church yes amen
[18:19] the holy ghost in a glorious Church
[18:22] operating at such a glorious
[18:24] height it was almost as every believer
[18:27] was like a William br in that
[18:29] day amen that's at what level that
[18:32] church was operating
[18:35] at but then the church was stripped of
[18:38] its glory in
[18:39] NAIA and how was she stripped of her
[18:41] glory when she replaced the Holy Spirit
[18:44] who was the headship of the church with
[18:46] a pope and in so doing she Dishonored
[18:50] her head and she was stripped of her
[18:55] [Music]
[18:56] glory and then what what happened when
[18:58] she was stripped of her glory there was
[19:00] a thousand years of Dark Ages and church
[19:02] history no power no glory in the
[19:07] church only church religion church
[19:10] denomination Church
[19:11] organizations but no glory in the
[19:15] church but then comes the last day
[19:17] messenger amen and in an age of gross
[19:20] darkness by faith he draws a little
[19:23] light on the drawing board yes amen when
[19:25] he sees an age of gross darkness when
[19:27] there was not even any light he draws a
[19:29] little glimpse of light on the board and
[19:32] he prophesies that this will be a
[19:33] glorious church amen a super race an
[19:36] invincible
[19:39] Army Amen in his ministry he introduced
[19:42] back the shakina glory into the church
[19:44] amen and why did he do this because
[19:46] remember the prophet was like Moses then
[19:48] the angel tell him as Moses was given
[19:50] two signs so you are given two signs am
[19:53] wasn't Moses given the word just like
[19:55] the prophet was given the word the pull
[19:56] of fire followed Moses just like the
[19:58] prophet so it was only F if Moses saw
[20:01] the Shak glory of the Lord that William
[20:04] gram also in the end time could reveal
[20:06] the sh glory of the
[20:09] Lord amen did not the prophet preach a
[20:13] uh the message are greater than Solomon
[20:15] is here and if the sh Glory could fill
[20:18] the temple in the days of Solomon how
[20:21] much more now and a greater than Solomon
[20:22] is here in fact when Shak Glory himself
[20:25] has come down yes amen you see Paul said
[20:29] I espouse you as a chased virgin to
[20:32] Christ and he thought us the headship
[20:35] who is the head of the church and
[20:38] William brandom come again and he showed
[20:41] us that we should not follow the
[20:43] leadership of man of denominations of
[20:46] the Pope and all of these systems he
[20:47] exposed the systems and he introduced us
[20:51] back to our headship amen he said that's
[20:53] our Lord up there am Hallelujah he
[20:55] brought us back to our right headship
[20:58] why it was the head coming down to unite
[21:00] with the body amen because when the wife
[21:03] comes under her proper headship again
[21:06] and she honors a headship then the glory
[21:08] returns amen you see the glory of the
[21:12] church has returned yes it was lost but
[21:16] it but it has returned why because we
[21:18] are not coming under the right headship
[21:21] the body is foly framed uniting with the
[21:23] head amen the prophet say she'll be so
[21:25] much like him yes as she approaches his
[21:28] coming amen now if you're not under
[21:31] headship if you are not being led by the
[21:33] angel of the Lord who is the Holy Ghost
[21:36] in Angelic form then you are dishonoring
[21:39] your head amen you have no glory you are
[21:40] cutting off your glory like Queen vasti
[21:43] was cut out from sharing in his glory
[21:46] because she Dishonored her
[21:50] head you see people are not connected
[21:52] with the Holy
[21:54] Ghost and if you're disconnected with
[21:56] the from the Holy Ghost how how then can
[21:58] you be a glorious Church how then can
[22:01] you live a glorious life if the glory
[22:03] itself is not living in
[22:06] you you see many people are still under
[22:09] the headship of a prophet or under the
[22:11] headship of some man or some pastor but
[22:14] you got to come under the headship of
[22:16] Christ am you see 60 years ago when the
[22:19] prophet was here it was okay you say you
[22:23] know being under the prophet is the same
[22:25] as being under the under Christ no no
[22:28] sir 60 years ago when the prophet was
[22:31] here then you could say that because
[22:33] Christ was veiled in a prophet 60 years
[22:35] ago it was the a son of man revealing
[22:39] the son of man so 60 years ago you look
[22:42] to the prophet you see Christ expressed
[22:45] but now when the prophet has put off
[22:49] mortality and has put on immortality and
[22:51] he cross
[22:53] Dimensions Christ now has to change form
[22:56] yes God is in Mor always changing his M
[23:00] hallelujah amen you see God takes away
[23:03] his man but never the spirit so if God
[23:05] took William brandom away guess what
[23:07] William brandom is no longer expressing
[23:09] Christ upon the Earth am Hallelujah now
[23:12] I want that to I want that to soak in in
[23:14] his proper
[23:15] context amen God takes away the man but
[23:18] never the spirit the spirit has moved on
[23:22] to where to a many membered body
[23:24] Hallelujah now I hope I'm saying that in
[23:26] the right way amen
[23:29] I believe in the prophet I love the
[23:30] prophet amen amen I thank God for the
[23:32] prophet but he is no longer veiling
[23:35] Christ to
[23:37] me amen I'm not come I'm not going to
[23:39] come here week in and week out and try
[23:41] and preach a sermon showing you types
[23:43] and shadows in the Bible of how the
[23:45] prophet was
[23:47] Vindicated amen can you imagine if we
[23:50] came every week here and try to preach
[23:52] and show you how the Bible said Jesus
[23:55] was going to come and die for us you
[23:56] would say brother we already already
[23:58] know that amen you would say brother I
[24:00] already Believe In Christ I've accepted
[24:03] him what good is that going to do for us
[24:05] now you see we know he was the prophet
[24:08] we know he has Vindicated we know he
[24:10] that he revealed the secrets of the
[24:12] Seven Seals and all of these things but
[24:14] what about me I want to hear about me I
[24:17] want to hear what the promises of God
[24:19] says about me I especially don't want to
[24:22] hear about the
[24:23] denominations amen we know they cursed
[24:26] there's no hope for them we heard in the
[24:27] morning queen V could no longer come
[24:29] into the presence of of the king
[24:32] hallelujah amen the prophet said I think
[24:34] it was in 55 or 54 he said I refuse to
[24:37] pray for America anymore they
[24:39] gone
[24:42] amen so we want to hear about us why
[24:45] because God is in Mor he's changed masks
[24:47] he's not in a many membered body
[24:51] amen you see we want to hear about the
[24:53] super race yes we want to hear about the
[24:56] super church that I'm a off Hallelujah
[24:59] you know when you're witnessing don't go
[25:01] tell people the first thing do you know
[25:02] that God sent a
[25:04] prophet because then they asks you okay
[25:06] where is this Prophet from you say no
[25:07] he's from America okay and where can we
[25:10] know he he died about 50 years ago the
[25:13] people will think you mad in your
[25:15] head but you should rather start off by
[25:17] telling them this did you hear that God
[25:19] has a body upon the Earth amen did you
[25:22] hear that God has a super race that's
[25:24] not expressing his glory upon the Earth
[25:26] that's expressing the very image of God
[25:29] that's how you start off not with
[25:31] history with present tense amen
[25:34] hallelujah amen God is revealing his
[25:37] glory to a people because a people has
[25:39] come under the right headship
[25:42] amen
[25:45] amen you see the church as we said is
[25:47] the
[25:48] female under the headship and if we are
[25:51] not under the headship and if we are not
[25:54] LED of the Holy Spirit we cut off our
[25:56] glory amen notice the scripture says in
[25:59] in in Corinthians uh that we read 11: 10
[26:04] for this cause ought the woman to have
[26:06] power on her head because of the
[26:08] Angels so when a woman has long hand she
[26:11] has a glory she's under the headship she
[26:13] has of Glory it's linked to a realm of
[26:16] the Unseen
[26:17] World amen it's link linked to a realm
[26:20] where there's Angels at attendance
[26:23] didn't we speak a few weeks ago in
[26:24] Isaiah when he has caught up into the
[26:26] glory Realm of the Lord God and he seen
[26:29] the glory of the king he said he's
[26:31] trained fill the temple amen he started
[26:33] to see Holy Angels amen why because he
[26:37] saw the glory of the Lord and where the
[26:38] glory of the Lord is the angels of God
[26:40] are present amen the angels of God are
[26:43] in attendance and we've heard and we've
[26:45] preached through the weeks that God
[26:46] sends his angels as ministering Spirits
[26:49] Hallelujah he sends Raa he sends you
[26:51] need healing he sends an angel to offer
[26:53] that to you if you need provision he
[26:55] sends an angel to attend to that need
[26:57] amen amen but to those who are under
[27:00] headship and under a glory anointing
[27:03] yes you see when the church is filled
[27:06] with the glory the Unseen World is at
[27:08] attention amen why because here stands a
[27:11] woman under the correct headship filled
[27:14] with
[27:15] glory amen you think the Lord has not
[27:18] given his angels charge over you
[27:20] ministering Spirits it amen amen
[27:23] hallelujah you see we we have to stop
[27:25] reading our Bible like a closed book we
[27:27] read chapters like First Corinthians we
[27:29] only think about the woman and condemn
[27:31] the woman but what is the hidden
[27:35] meaning amen you see but you sisters
[27:38] amen also pay attention because as we
[27:42] said before it's not a small thing you
[27:44] think it's a small thing if you just
[27:45] Trim in your hair here and there but the
[27:48] prophet says a man can actually divorce
[27:50] his wife for it and angels are at
[27:53] attendance when you have your hair long
[27:55] that's what the Bible
[27:56] says
[27:59] amen so don't think you can get away
[28:01] with it amen now I'm not preaching to
[28:03] the sisters yeah now we got good sisters
[28:05] here I'm preaching to the streaming
[28:09] audience you see it doesn't matter now
[28:12] who you s to me whether you saw some
[28:14] pastor's family trim their ha or you saw
[28:16] the prophet's family do it it doesn't
[28:18] matter this is the
[28:20] standard no one's family is the standard
[28:22] this is the standard
[28:25] hallelujah amen
[28:28] why it's typing the church yes under
[28:34] headship now you know all that was just
[28:37] to build a foundation because here's
[28:39] where where I want to get to to try and
[28:41] build up to a climax let's let's just go
[28:44] to the story of Samson for a
[28:46] while and we know Samson lived in the
[28:49] days of the judges right yes and he was
[28:51] the seven judge and we know that there
[28:54] were seven Church ages and whenever each
[28:57] each messenger sounded his trumpet we
[28:59] know it declared why the prophet tells
[29:01] us because to those who received the
[29:04] message it was mercy and Grace to those
[29:06] who refused to receive it it was
[29:08] judgment
[29:09] amen you see the days of judges and we
[29:13] know in the days of the seventh angel
[29:14] when the mighty Angel descends seven
[29:17] angels form the week of his judgment
[29:19] amen yes the age of the Supreme
[29:23] judge now Samson was a Nazarite
[29:28] and a to be a Nazarite means they were
[29:30] separated for a holy consecration unto
[29:32] the
[29:33] Lord you see we are separated for a holy
[29:37] consecration unto the Lord number six
[29:41] tells us in verse 5 all the days of the
[29:44] vow of his talking about a Nazar right
[29:46] now all the days of the vow of his
[29:48] separation there shall no razor come
[29:50] upon his head until the days be filled
[29:53] in the which he separated himself unto
[29:55] the Lord He Shall Behold holy and shall
[29:58] let the locks of his hair of his hair
[30:01] grow and remember we laid the foundation
[30:04] in Corinthians the hair types the
[30:09] glory and by keeping the hair was a
[30:13] glory unto a woman a sign of submission
[30:15] to headship but to and to Samson it was
[30:18] a sign of his Consecration and vow to
[30:20] his God so long as he kept his hair and
[30:23] no razor came upon his head it was a
[30:25] sign of his Consecration and to God and
[30:28] so long as he was separated and
[30:30] consecrated unto God he is full of glory
[30:33] amen full of Power full of the
[30:36] anointing and notice what the prophet
[30:38] says he says and also Samson when he met
[30:42] those Philistines did you ever think of
[30:44] that why Samson they've gotten pictured
[30:47] as a man having shoulders like bondor
[30:50] well it wouldn't be no secret to find a
[30:51] man like that could pick up a lion and
[30:53] tear him in two you see the
[30:55] denominational world but Samson and the
[30:58] prophet says forgive me for this
[31:00] expression I'll just make it like he was
[31:02] a little curly haired shrimp just a
[31:04] little mama's boy seven little
[31:07] curls hanging down and you remember he
[31:10] was a weakling until the spirit of the
[31:12] Lord came upon Him amen you see the
[31:15] church is weak until the spirit of the
[31:17] Lord comes upon
[31:18] it
[31:20] amen the prophet says did you ever think
[31:23] take that old dry Jawbone off the desert
[31:26] there and strike one of those helmets
[31:28] why that jawone would go into a thousand
[31:30] pieces but he stood there and threw them
[31:33] steel helmets them with Spears just beat
[31:35] them right and left till he beat down a
[31:38] thousand the rest of them he run in the
[31:40] Rocks what was it as long as he could
[31:42] reach back there and F them Seven Locks
[31:45] that was God's covenant there wasn't
[31:47] nothing going to bother him as long as
[31:49] he had the Covenant promise amen and
[31:52] nothing can bother the Church of the
[31:53] Living God as long as we can feel the
[31:56] Holy Ghost the Covenant of God's word in
[31:59] our hearts the Pentecostal blessing for
[32:02] the works that I do shall you do also
[32:04] the life that's in me will be in you as
[32:07] the father had sent me so sent I you the
[32:10] father that sent him come in him then
[32:13] the Jesus that sends the man goes in the
[32:15] man it isn't the man it's Jesus it
[32:18] wasn't Jesus it was God as the father
[32:21] sent me so send I you
[32:24] amen going on down as long as I can feel
[32:27] the spirit of God around something is
[32:30] going to happen I can see people that
[32:32] will believe it that will reflect the
[32:34] Praises and glory of God now are you one
[32:36] of them he says I can see people that
[32:38] will believe it and that will reflect
[32:40] the Praises and glory of
[32:43] God you see Samson where he got his
[32:46] power from where he got his glory from
[32:48] he was consecrated he was a Nazarite
[32:52] consecrated unto a holy consecration to
[32:54] God thank you and his hair was a sign of
[32:57] his
[32:59] glory now the prophet says Samson was
[33:03] weak in stature But Not only was he weak
[33:06] in stature Samson was also weak in the
[33:08] flesh you see Samson was a man of many
[33:11] failures we don't sometimes we don't
[33:13] look at that because we always looking
[33:14] at the great things that Samson did but
[33:17] you if you read in the Bible there it
[33:18] talks about Samson Samson would go in
[33:20] the night and sleep with a harlot and
[33:23] the next morning he will go and he will
[33:25] take the gates and carry all those mens
[33:27] with the
[33:28] anointing and so long as he was doing
[33:31] that Samson was starting to get away
[33:33] from his Nazarite vow he was supposed to
[33:36] be a holy Nazareth consecrated unto God
[33:40] but he started to get away from that he
[33:41] started to sleep around the very
[33:44] Philistines that he was meant to destroy
[33:46] Samson started flooding with
[33:50] them and when Samson started do to do
[33:53] this God just never leave him stay at
[33:55] same the same time you see you see gifts
[33:57] and callings are without repentance amen
[34:00] Samson still have the power now I want
[34:02] to show you the point while Samson was
[34:05] failing in his flesh most probably every
[34:07] day he would realize that he he made a
[34:09] mistake and he would repent and he would
[34:10] confess and the glory never left him as
[34:14] yet but one day when Samson was with
[34:18] Delila now he already knew that dala
[34:21] tried to deceive him three times she
[34:23] tried to trick him trick him three times
[34:26] so now Samson knew what he was doing he
[34:29] was not deceived he knew Delilah was
[34:31] trying to do this but because of his
[34:34] love for Delilah he loved deila more
[34:37] than his secret
[34:39] power you see he started to love Delilah
[34:41] more than his consecration to
[34:44] God yes all along he has failing in the
[34:46] flesh but now he started to betray his
[34:49] own secret power until he gave up his
[34:52] own secret
[34:53] power and when Samson did this he his
[34:57] glory was cut
[34:58] off he sold his butt
[35:01] right oh like Jacob and Esau for a few
[35:05] moments of pleasure he sold his birt
[35:06] right he sold out his
[35:08] glory but you see Jacob was not so yeah
[35:12] Jacob knew what the birthright
[35:14] meant he knew with the birthright come
[35:16] the blessing come the glory come the
[35:18] anointing and Jacob even though he was a
[35:21] deceiver he did everything he could to
[35:24] get the birth right to get the glory to
[35:26] get the anointing amen and when he did
[35:28] that amen he is able to wrestle with
[35:30] angels coming from Heaven amen
[35:32] hallelujah you see when you go after the
[35:34] birth right and you get the glory then
[35:37] you are now negotiating with an Unseen
[35:39] World amen hallelujah so much so that
[35:43] Jacob didn't even want to let go of the
[35:44] Angel amen he wrestled all night with
[35:47] the angel amen you see that is why we
[35:49] need rugged Christians amen they can
[35:51] wrestle with angels amen you need
[35:53] someone who is able to be bold and go
[35:55] into the presence of the King amen you
[35:58] need someone who's be who's able to be
[35:59] bold and go to the mighty Angel and say
[36:01] give me the book amen you see this is
[36:03] the kind of character that God is
[36:05] looking for amen you see everyone else
[36:07] was scared to come into the presence of
[36:09] the king but Esther came amen boldly
[36:13] before the
[36:14] king Jacob was able to wrestle boldly
[36:17] with the angel amen amen but Samson he
[36:21] sold amen his secret power his secret
[36:25] Glory
[36:30] and you see God will be merciful unto
[36:32] you until you cross that line one too
[36:34] many times and then the doors of Mercy
[36:37] are shut you cut off the glory you cut
[36:41] off the presence now I want you to hear
[36:44] that amen maybe God is speaking to
[36:46] someone here today amen stop doing what
[36:48] you're doing God will only let you go by
[36:51] with it for so long but there comes a
[36:54] time when God has to cut the line amen
[36:56] amen don't let it come to that don't
[36:58] sell your secret Glory don't cut off
[37:01] your
[37:02] glory because when you do that what
[37:04] happened as soon as Samson's Glory was
[37:07] cut off the first thing they did was
[37:08] take off his eyes soon as you let your
[37:11] glory get cut off the first thing that
[37:13] happens you start to find fault with the
[37:14] prophet you start to find fault with the
[37:16] message then you want to leave the
[37:18] message why the eyes are taken
[37:22] off amen hear the whining of the Lord
[37:25] whoever this is
[37:27] stop what you're doing come back to the
[37:29] glory of the Lord don't sell your glory
[37:36] short you see I wonder if we in the
[37:39] message if we've allow the glory of the
[37:40] Lord to be cut off and whether we
[37:43] whether we've come out from the right
[37:45] headship what is the headship the
[37:47] headship is the holy spirit in the
[37:49] church again and if the holy spirit is
[37:51] not leading the church you're under the
[37:53] wrong headship you most probably under
[37:55] the headship of a of a
[37:57] man and so long as you're not under the
[37:59] headship of the Holy Spirit there is no
[38:01] glory in the church
[38:07] yes amen he forsook his Nazarite vow but
[38:11] very quickly coming to a
[38:14] conclusion if you read numbers I want
[38:16] you when you go home read number six
[38:18] which talks about a Nazarite and it says
[38:21] when a Nazarite is consecrated unto the
[38:23] Lord and for some reason he is defiled
[38:27] for any some reason he is defiled with
[38:29] sin or inequity or something that is
[38:31] Unholy there's a process to come back
[38:34] read number six it says that as soon as
[38:37] this
[38:38] happens he's now his head must be
[38:41] shaven he must reconsecrate his life
[38:44] back to God the priest need to offer up
[38:46] the sacrifice for him there must be a
[38:48] sacrifice he must reconsecrate his life
[38:51] back to God then now he can be a
[38:52] Nazarite again consecrated unto God so
[38:56] you see the church that has cut off the
[38:59] glory now if we want to come back under
[39:01] the right headship we got to come under
[39:03] the consec now what did we do last year
[39:06] you got to come back to
[39:08] consecration you got to come back to the
[39:10] right headship for the glory of the Lord
[39:13] to come back amen and when Samson did
[39:16] this now whilst he's in in the house of
[39:18] the Philistines now he started to
[39:21] remember who he was he started to
[39:24] remember who he was and he started to
[39:26] consecrate himself again he said Lord he
[39:29] started to repent he said Lord if I
[39:32] could just put my hands on these pillars
[39:35] and now he started to remember what his
[39:37] purpose was see before he forgot his
[39:39] purpose his purpose he was born to slay
[39:42] the Philistines but he started to fraize
[39:45] with the
[39:46] Philistines but now he's remembering his
[39:48] purpose and you see we we were born to
[39:52] be powerful people in the end time to
[39:54] slay every demon power Amen to bring
[39:56] bring everything under subjection to the
[39:58] power of our word but now we find
[40:01] ourselves Straton ising with the things
[40:02] of the world but now remember our
[40:06] Consecration and say once more just once
[40:08] more Lord amen if I could just put my
[40:11] hands back on the two pillars of the Old
[40:13] Testament and the New Testament of the
[40:16] oil and the wine amen oh Lord if I can
[40:18] just do that I can slay the fullest
[40:21] times amen and L Samson said I will die
[40:25] with them Lord I will die to this flesh
[40:28] and in so doing I can slay every demon
[40:30] power amen when the glory of the Lord
[40:33] started to come upon Samson again he's
[40:35] here he's going back amen and the glory
[40:38] of the Lord started to come upon Samson
[40:40] again and he destroyed the fullest Army
[40:43] oh Church of the Living God you see
[40:45] three two 2,000 years the glory of the
[40:48] Lord has been cut off from the church
[40:50] but the hair the Seven Locks he starting
[40:52] to grow back amen we starting to
[40:55] consecrate ourselves again remember your
[40:58] consecration amen let the glory of the
