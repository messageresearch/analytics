[8:36] therefore I say unto you what things
[8:38] soever ye desire when ye believe when ye
[8:42] pray believe that ye receive them and ye
[8:44] shall have them amen amen let's also
[8:47] turn to Matthew 21 verse
[8:52] 21 Jesus answered and said unto them
[8:56] verily I say unto you if they have faith
[8:59] and doubt not ye shall not only do this
[9:04] which is done to the victory but also if

[9:49] that those are coming expecting God get
[9:52] what they needed God name of Jesus
[9:54] Christ thank you
[9:58] amen
[10:00] amen amen so I am a bit
[10:04] no it's been like four years since I
[10:08] lasted
[10:10] uh and uh I want to say that when I got
[10:13] the call I was very nervous because I I
[10:16] think I kind of knew what he was ask me
[10:19] for so uh like I I don't have anything
[10:24] long to preach tonight
[10:26] but I want us to Rejoice tonight amen
[10:30] hallelujah and um just after the call
[10:33] I've noticed that devil has been coming
[10:36] my way from last night now uh my old leg
[10:40] Wasing all of a sudden only happening I
[10:44] woke up I had upset stomach and uh today
[10:47] in the room right now there's lots of
[10:49] that
[10:50] updating and it was like wow
[10:53] okay the devil wants to get finished
[10:55] tonight so we finishing tonight
[11:00] amen so we look in the scripture
[11:04] and when you say in Mark 11:23 and he
[11:08] says shall not doubt in his heart amen I
[11:12] feel like the Saints need to really take
[11:14] that much more seriously amen because
[11:17] the prophet he emphasizes every time
[11:20] that we shouldn't have any doubt in our
[11:21] hearts amen before any prayer you say
[11:24] don't doubt but what is doubt okay so a
[11:27] general definition is that is a feeling
[11:29] of uncertainty okay or lack of
[11:32] conviction okay conviction now it is the
[11:34] quality of showing that one is firmly
[11:37] convinced of one of what One Believes or
[11:40] says amen so doubt is such a big problem
[11:46] because it's it's stopping you from
[11:47] having what you want and we need to
[11:50] cancel it out we need to cancel this
[11:52] demon of
[11:53] Doubt so tonight we are tackling this
[11:56] demon of doubt and you're going out
[11:58] there
[11:59] what
[12:00] want amen if you look at what prophet
[12:03] says it says and now this demon of doubt
[12:07] that would hang over the people that
[12:09] would cause him to doubt Satan you have
[12:12] lost the
[12:13] battle for years you've kept Humanity
[12:15] shut in doubt but God in his Mercy has
[12:18] sent us the light and you are a deceiver
[12:22] and you exposed and you have no deer
[12:24] light
[12:26] amen thank you Lord God how how you love
[12:29] God so much you take get rid of doubts
[12:33] you want to be in one Accord amen get
[12:35] rid of the doubts
[12:36] in amen thank you Jesus and we also know
[12:40] that doubt it started all the way in the
[12:43] garden of Ed and doubt is a sin as and
[12:47] we as a bre of Christ must tackle this
[12:50] any any of Doubt don't let it get to you
[12:53] okay amen uh if you look in the Bible
[12:57] also you get Zechariah he had doubt and
[12:59] what did God do to him he shut his mouth
[13:02] amen so what to say he also shut his
[13:06] mouth because he also had a lack of
[13:08] faith why to say that God can to you
[13:10] right now amen we should be
[13:15] fearful amen and we also look at what
[13:19] lack of conviction into our lives so
[13:21] what does it mean it means that people
[13:24] do not have a any true determination to
[13:27] do something to succeed right and
[13:30] another meaning is that a person has
[13:32] lost or not found meaning in what
[13:34] they're doing meaning they don't even
[13:36] know their purpose who they are and what
[13:39] they are and what they are capable of
[13:41] doing but we as the bride of Christ
[13:44] should know who we are what we capable
[13:47] of doing amen we should be strongly
[13:50] convicted by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[13:53] am don't go out there living your life
[13:55] doing whatever you want without having
[13:58] this conviction in your Liv amen uh it's
[14:02] very you have to get conviction left so
[14:04] if you go ahead and not pray not read
[14:07] your Bible not stick to the word not
[14:09] keep Godly thoughts in your head nothing
[14:11] positive amen you have lack of
[14:14] conviction and that's stopping you from
[14:16] getting what you want it's causing doubt
[14:18] in your heart amen
[14:21] amen amen let the Holy Spirit bring
[14:24] conviction into your life let it fix you
[14:27] right now amen right now in your seats
[14:30] ask the Holy Ghost to fix you right now
[14:32] get straight get you back in line amen
[14:36] and remember that once you already
[14:38] prayed for it and believe that you
[14:40] received it now this is when you get rid
[14:41] of your doubts this is when you get
[14:43] convicted in your heart amen amen
[14:46] whatever situation you have whether it's
[14:49] Financial whether it's a healing problem
[14:52] whether it's any any sort of problem any
[14:54] small problem remember this with this
[14:57] whole scripture now
[14:59] and it's already
[15:00] yours
[15:02] Hallelujah challenge yourself okay God
[15:05] loves a challenge right and how much
[15:07] more the bread of Christ for love for
[15:08] challenge as well you want to be just
[15:10] like him so challenge yourself amen amen
[15:13] uh have some determination within you
[15:16] amen without any doubt
[15:18] amen amen wonder and if you look at
[15:22] story of the Shad woman you'll see how
[15:25] determined she was yes so if you look at
[15:28] the message of the blind bimus the
[15:32] prophet dramatizes about how um his
[15:34] mother used to tell him how B mother
[15:36] used to tell him about the stories about
[15:38] Elijah the prophet and how bimus caught
[15:41] the the revelation of prophet you know
[15:43] he believed Prophet amen he held on to
[15:46] that amen and if you look at bamus he
[15:50] was physically blind now Prophet says
[15:54] that to be spiritually blind is far more
[15:57] worse than physically blind yes amen but
[16:01] amen when the word came to us when the
[16:03] world was revealed to us our eyes opened
[16:05] am we caught that Revelation yes amen
[16:09] and there's a small sa about spiritual
[16:12] blindness so the prophet says and people
[16:16] are so spiritually blind today though
[16:19] though the Lord God come down in the
[16:21] midst of them and do anything and the
[16:23] things he promised they still can't see
[16:25] it amen they are spiritually blind yes
[16:28] don't know God don't know his great
[16:30] power amen and now if you look back into
[16:33] the story of the shin woman where Elisha
[16:37] told gazi to go to her with a staff
[16:40] right right
[16:42] um but if you look at the woman she
[16:45] didn't want the stuff she didn't she
[16:47] didn't have Fai in that stuff it was in
[16:49] the prophet am said I will not leave you
[16:53] I'm determined to stay with you and hold
[16:55] on till I find out why God took my baby
[16:59] amen she knew if she ever got to him
[17:01] that God would reveal it to him why Took
[17:04] My Baby amen so whatever questions you
[17:07] have within your situation whatever
[17:10] thing is holding you whatever things got
[17:12] you questioning about what's happening
[17:14] hold on we spoke about having Ro Faith
[17:17] about holding on right and now why don't
[17:20] you have that same type for
[17:21] determination to hold on and ask God to
[17:25] beg God what's what's happening amen
[17:28] because the prophet says I like that
[17:30] determination too she was determined to
[17:33] hold on unto it yes when something's
[17:35] wrong and you can't understand take a
[17:38] hold of God and hold onto him so
[17:40] something answers just don't be well I
[17:43] prayed last night and I haven't heard
[17:44] yet so I guess he doesn't answer no more
[17:48] but the prophet says hold on to him just
[17:51] keep holding on and I will not leave you
[17:53] be like Jacob westle all day and night
[17:56] as he do with the angel I'll not leave
[17:58] you amen yes amen and the the church
[18:03] shouldn't forget that we have a six
[18:06] sense you shouldn't be forget forgetful
[18:09] about that and it sometimes we have the
[18:14] faith but we unconscious about it
[18:17] Prophet speaks about that amen it's like
[18:20] it's like you know you have eyes that
[18:21] can see but you chose to close your eyes
[18:24] and walk yes amen and says your fate is
[18:30] unconscious don't press now or jump you
[18:33] jump away from it it's right with you
[18:35] just relax yourself just believe now and
[18:39] have faith amen and be reverent just
[18:42] have faith just believe sometimes your
[18:44] faith is unconscious you have it and you
[18:47] don't know it amen I want you tonight to
[18:50] tap in to that six sense I want you to
[18:52] forget physical senses I want you to use
[18:55] a spiritual man and tap in to that six s
[18:58] tonight amen when you going out here you
[19:01] use the six sense you speak what you
[19:03] want Remember by faith you are saved and
[19:06] by faith you can Channel anything you
[19:08] want you want healing you can get it
[19:10] into Faith amen amen hallelujah am amen
[19:13] Prophet says now Faith is not healing
[19:16] Faith produces healing amen amen so you
[19:20] can't uh now you can have faith for
[19:22] healing and I believe many of you many
[19:25] of you have faith for healing right amen
[19:27] amen
[19:28] amen
[19:31] it amen amen but you can't receive
[19:34] healing until you purchase healing by
[19:36] the faith that you have
[19:39] amen amen faith is really simple that
[19:43] people compicated so much because of our
[19:45] physical body and our kindal minds that
[19:49] yes the prophet says how simple Fai is
[19:52] like for instance you can't move out of
[19:54] your seats if you're able to come if
[19:57] you're able to come sit down you can
[19:59] move out of your seat if you don't
[20:01] believe it but you know that you can
[20:03] move out of your seat right and just
[20:05] like you canot put your hat on um not if
[20:10] you don't believe it you can put your
[20:11] hat on but you know you can put your hat
[20:13] on your head right yes
[20:15] now yesterday I read the I read the
[20:18] testimony of on the group chat uh I like
[20:23] f have you ready amen it it inspired me
[20:26] for today's message
[20:30] and how she believed that she knew that
[20:34] if she asks it she'll get it she didn't
[20:36] have any doubts and that child like fate
[20:38] was so inspiring that I just had to tell
[20:41] you today um about that and how simple
[20:45] it is you know to have childlike Fai and
[20:47] you'll get what you want you got healed
[20:49] amen yes amen amen and then
[20:52] um maybe this is quite simple for you
[20:57] all uh small case I mean um so like my
[21:02] exams
[21:03] are uh testing and ethic for me that so
[21:08] two weeks ago I wrot this one paper and
[21:12] I learned a lot of it and but when I
[21:15] went to examp I blanked out blank out so
[21:20] told myself you know what just come down
[21:22] have War water then look back at the
[21:25] PA but then I was looking nothing wasn't
[21:28] speaking to me so right there I said to
[21:31] myself God take over give me the answers
[21:35] to this question amen God help me out
[21:38] through this and God gave me just enough
[21:42] information to write on the paper two
[21:44] weeks later I had my result and he just
[21:47] managed to make me
[21:49] pass and you have no idea how I was
[21:51] reing I was lening the car of my friends
[21:54] and I was rejoicing I was so happy like
[21:57] amen God really saw through me again in
[22:00] my
[22:01] life it meant a lot to me and also
[22:05] remember that it happened to me when I
[22:06] was in grade seven that year I got
[22:10] baptized uh I gave my heart to L so well
[22:13] it I was small that time but I remember
[22:16] asking God in that paper to help me get
[22:20] and instantly it revealed to me what
[22:23] what I have amen and it's it meant so
[22:26] lot so much to me it's I carried on to
[22:28] my life that in the simple things like
[22:30] that God can help you through amen
[22:33] that's why you can start small like
[22:37] remember small thank
[22:40] amen thank you
[22:43] and faith is the victory that overcomes
[22:47] Every curse of the devil amen amen faith
[22:51] is the victory faith in what not faith

[35:02] about his blad coming in full power and
[35:04] amen we are at that stage amen amen

[35:51] it amen he said that also if you love
[35:54] him you'll keep his word amen need claim
[35:57] all the promises that's why it's really
[36:00] important to keep on reading the Bible
[36:02] it there you know there's like over like
[36:06] 7,000 promises in the Bible right so why
[36:11] cry why came promises he said he will
[36:15] never leave you not forsake you Hebrews
[36:18] 135 he said that he's always with us he
[36:21] will never forget us he chose us amen he
[36:24] watches our lives and keeps us from harm
[36:26] strengthens us and helps us meets all
[36:29] our needs
[36:32] amen and Peter said on the day of pen
[36:34] because these promises is to you and
[36:37] your children and them that's far off
[36:40] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[36:42] call amen and when they met when they
[36:45] met acts 238 God honored the check went
[36:48] to the queen Clearing House and yet it
[36:51] come back they begin to speak in tongues
[36:53] and prophesy magnify God Amen and God
[36:57] when a Believer signs his name as a
[36:59] Believer and passes through God's
[37:01] Pentecostal Clearing House with the
[37:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost God will pay
[37:06] off every promise and everything else

[37:19] can't sign no other way won't work he
[37:21] don't he don't know no titles amen he
[37:25] only knows the name amen believe that
[37:28] amen thankes just his name is the only
[37:31] thing that's needed so ask the father
[37:33] anything in my
[37:34] name amen amen
[37:38] amen yes amen and we also out to have
[37:43] the mind of Christ within us amen the
[37:46] bride needs to have him within us so we
[37:49] have to reflect him through our land so
[37:52] Romans 8 Romans chapter 8 verse6 for to
[37:55] be kindly minded is dead but to be
[37:58] spiritually minded is life and peace
[38:00] because the caral mind is enity against
[38:03] God for it is not subject to the law of
[38:05] God neither indeed can be so then they
[38:09] that are in the flesh cannot please God
[38:12] but ye are not in the flesh but in
[38:14] spirit amen if so be that the spirit of
[38:17] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[38:20] the spirit of Christ he is none of this
[38:23] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[38:25] because of sin yes amen but the spirit
[38:28] is life because of righteousness amen
[38:31] but the spirit of him that rais up Jesus
[38:33] from the dead dwell in you he that rais
[38:36] up Christ from the dead shall also
[38:37] Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[38:40] that dwelleth in you amen you got to die
[38:44] to every thought of the flesh amen you
[38:47] got to die to every thought of the flesh
[38:49] so that you can receive the mind of
[38:50] Christ and walk hence forth not of your
[38:53] own but of his mind amen the mind of
[38:56] Christ in you that's the only way you
[38:58] can stay alive am
[39:00] amen amen and the God God hates the
[39:05] human mind he doesn't like the way the
[39:07] human mind works okay the same thing so
[39:11] the prophet says the same things will
[39:13] blind the eyes of the carnal man because
[39:15] it can't understand things of God it's
[39:17] against God it's the enemy of God yes
[39:21] human mind is the enemy to God you got
[39:23] to get out of your own human mind and be
[39:25] born a new by the holy spirit amen and
[39:28] get the mind of God within you then you
[39:31] can believe those things then it becomes
[39:33] a reality amen amen and Philippians 2:5
[39:38] let this mind be in you which was also
[39:41] in Christ Jesus amen so what happens
[39:44] when the mind of Christ comes within
[39:46] you when Christ comes into the heart
[39:50] then he comes into the mouth then he
[39:52] comes into the eyes he comes into the
[39:54] Mind amen he comes into into the mouth
[39:57] it makes you talk different you don't
[39:59] like you don't talk like you used to

[40:04] done grow now from your heart uh your
[40:07] love your love you have for him so you
[40:10] can B down but that's a great thing amen
[40:15] and then the next thing you know it
[40:17] grows into your eyes the next thing you
[40:19] know you find out the old as things that
[40:22] you used to look at you'll turn away
[40:23] from it am and the first thing you know
[40:26] still turn your head but you're thinking
[40:28] but after a while it grows into your
[40:30] mind you don't even think about
[40:32] it so you're just a full grown creature
[40:36] now you're a full brand new creature
[40:38] that has no no tast that doesn't want
[40:40] any Taste of his world have the mind of
[40:43] Christ within you amen and that's such a
[40:46] gor thing and such a beautiful thing to
[40:48] have amen and when the bride has the
[40:51] mind of Christ you'll notice the harmony
[40:54] of the father and the son yes Jesus
[40:56] Jesus never did anything until it was
[40:58] first showed him by the Father John
[41:02] 59 this harmony is now to exist between
[41:04] the Grom and his bre amen he he showed
[41:08] her his Word of Life she received it she
[41:10] never doubted amen therefore nothing can
[41:13] harmer amen not even debt amen for if
[41:17] the seed be planted the water will rise
[41:19] will raise it up again amen here is a
[41:22] secret of this the word is in the Bri as
[41:25] it was in Mary
[41:26] uh the bride has the mind of Christ for
[41:29] she knows what he wants done with the
[41:32] word amen performs the command of the
[41:35] word in his name amen and she has thus
[41:38] say the Lord amen then the word is
[41:41] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
