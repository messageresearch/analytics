[39:59] but for a higher calling.
[40:02] But in the days of the voice of the
[40:04] seventh angel, for he shall predict the
[40:09] mystery of God, which is completed, as
[40:13] he has declared unto his servants, the
[40:16] prophets.
[40:18] We thank you for the offering that has
[40:21] been given by each member of the
[40:25] mystical body. Yes, we pray dear God
[40:29] that the efforts of giving not only not
[40:32] only was to be of receiving but it is
[40:36] given oh God with the love of God that
[40:40] has been constrained in the hearts to be
[40:43] put to use for the furtherance of this
[40:46] conviction in the mighty name of Jesus.
[40:50] Bless us now father as we turn the
[40:53] service over to you. May you have the
[40:56] oversight of pouring out your revelation
[41:00] that even as we are here this morning,
[41:03] we will be humble within the confines of
[41:07] our hearts to receive your word in the
[41:10] mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[41:14] Christ. And all shall say, amen.

[41:28] You know, in our time, I tell you, your
[41:30] time is up for a dangerous thing to
[41:33] hear. But when our time has come, we

[46:12] emotional.
[46:14] like a rose trampled
[46:17] crushed
[46:19] for me and for you.
[46:22] Servants of the Lord, brothers and
[46:24] sisters, you may take your seats for a
[46:26] while. I preach in the name of the Lord
[46:28] Jesus Christ this morning. And as it's
[46:32] already been stated, welcome to Easter
[46:35] 2025. Give the Lord a
[46:41] hand. Praise the Lord.
[46:44] because without him none of this would
[46:46] have been possible. Amen. Thank you
[46:49] physicians. Thank you so much. Played
[46:52] skillfully. God bless you. Amen. Praise
[46:54] the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. We're truly
[46:57] blessed today to have a job brother and
[46:59] friend in our midst.
[47:02] You've seen the posters already that
[47:05] pastor Adele is in the house. Give the
[47:08] Lord a hand of praise.
[47:11] [Music]
[47:15] The brother was kind enough to accept
[47:17] our invitation to come and minister for
[47:19] the Easter
[47:21] services. And we grateful to the Lord
[47:23] for keeping him healthy. Hallelujah.
[47:26] So that he could honor his commitment.
[47:28] Praise be to God. And come and speak the
[47:31] word of God to us. Amen. Our precious
[47:34] brothers been in ministry for 36 years.
[47:37] Wonderful. We thank the Lord Jesus
[47:39] Christ. Amen. Amen. And he hails from
[47:41] Lagos in Nigeria
[47:44] where he faithfully leads a
[47:45] wellestablished church called Bible Way
[47:48] Fellowship Tabernacle.
[47:51] Through the years, God has used our
[47:53] brother mightily and he's even allowed
[47:56] him to minister and travel across the
[47:59] world. Amen. God is gracious. Amen.
[48:02] We're also honored to welcome his
[48:04] precious wife this morning, Sister
[48:06] Sharon, who serves faithfully by our
[48:10] brother's side. Give the Lord a hand of
[48:13] [Music]
[48:17] praise. You know, brother and sister,
[48:19] many times we highlight the ministry of
[48:21] the man, but if the man doesn't have a
[48:24] good woman at his side, it can be
[48:27] difficult. So, God bless you, Sister
[48:30] Sharon. Wherever you are, where where
[48:32] you sister
[48:33] [Music]
[48:34] [Applause]
[48:35] [Music]
[48:40] Sharon, sister, God bless you. Together,
[48:43] they've been blessed with four children.
[48:45] God has given them two sons and two
[48:47] daughters, and they're also the proud
[48:50] grandparents of a grandson. So, we thank
[48:53] the Lord for that. Amen. As some of you
[48:56] might know, this is not his first visit
[48:58] to South Africa. Amen. I believe he was
[49:01] here about 20 years ago, brothers. About
[49:05] 20 years ago. And the first place where
[49:07] he ministered was in Derwin. So this is
[49:10] like a homecoming.
[49:13] [Applause]
[49:18] We believe that when God sends a man,
[49:20] Yes. God gives him a message.
[49:23] Hallelujah. So this morning, we're in
[49:26] anticipation.
[49:28] We under expectations.
[49:31] We want to hear what the Lord has in
[49:34] store for us. May he set out a great
[49:36] outpouring, brother, sister. It's
[49:37] already started as you know. May he
[49:40] continue with that outpouring. Amen. Not
[49:43] only here, but wherever the eagles are
[49:45] gathered across the globe. God bless the
[49:48] Eagles.
[49:50] Hallelujah. Before we hand over the
[49:52] service to our precious
[49:54] brother, we also want to take a moment
[49:56] to express our deep gratitude to all the
[50:00] pastors and the congregations that they
[50:02] represent. Give the Lord a hand of
[50:04] [Applause]
[50:10] praise. I know there's going to be a
[50:12] formal thank you at the end of the
[50:13] service, but I just want to send a thank
[50:15] you up front. Hallelujah. There's
[50:18] they've labored a lot. There's been a
[50:20] lot of labor and they they they've
[50:22] worked faithfully entire sleep to put
[50:25] these meetings together. Amen. Last
[50:28] night while he was sleeping, there were
[50:30] brethren who were setting these chairs
[50:32] 1:00 in the morning setting these
[50:34] chairs. Let's give the Lord a
[50:38] [Music]
[50:40] hand. May God richly bless you for your
[50:43] effort. Amen. And to everyone else who
[50:45] who made the slightest effort towards
[50:48] this meeting, anything you did,
[50:51] anything, if you made a phone call, if
[50:53] you gave someone that anything, God
[50:55] bless you this
[51:00] morning. Unfortunately, a few pastors
[51:03] couldn't be present due to pre-arranged
[51:05] commitments. Amen. So we have apologies
[51:08] from our precious pastor Denzel who was
[51:11] in Zimbabwe for Easter meetings and our
[51:14] dear pastor Rodney who was in Trinidad
[51:18] and he'll be crossing over to the USA
[51:20] for Easter meetings as well. May God
[51:22] bless the dear servants of the Lord. Let
[51:25] us stand this morning brother and sister
[51:27] as we welcome the servant of the Lord
[51:29] our precious pastor Don may speak what
[51:33] God has laid on his heart.
[51:35] water the world with your amen.
[51:39] Rebecca watered the camels and they took
[51:42] her to Isaac. The same word that you
[51:45] watch is going to take you to
[51:48] our sing. I'm amazed that he loves me.
[51:53] And then he will hand over to our
[51:54] precious servant of the Lord, our
[51:56] pastor. God bless you, my dear. Let us
[51:59] sing. I'm amazed that you love me. We'll
[52:02] sing it twice.
[52:05] I'm
[52:08] amazed that you love me.
[52:12] [Music]
[52:20] I through your
[52:23] preious blood I found
[52:28] it and my
[52:30] sins are washed.

[53:24] [Music]
[53:26] [Applause]
[53:29] May we please bow our heads for a word
[53:32] of prayer.
[53:34] Gracious almighty God,
[53:37] we want to return thanksgiving unto you
[53:40] this morning. Hallelujah. for this
[53:43] wonderful privilege that we have as your
[53:46] sons and daughters
[53:49] to gather around your blessings.
[53:52] Thank you for making us who you have
[53:54] made us.
[53:56] Lord, it is not by power not by might
[53:59] from hurt to glory. Salvation is of the
[54:03] Lord.
[54:05] You said you will have mercy upon whom
[54:07] you will have mercy. Compassion upon
[54:10] whom you will have. We thank you father
[54:14] that we are the one that are on the
[54:15] right side of your church. Thank you for
[54:18] making us vessels of honor.
[54:21] We appreciate you papa God. May you
[54:24] receive our thanksgiving.
[54:27] May you receive our worship. We pray
[54:30] that you will accept all our praise
[54:33] offerings.
[54:34] And the rendering of a grateful heart
[54:38] that we have done in your presence. the
[54:40] special numbers, the beautiful songs,
[54:43] and everything we've done. Your children
[54:45] who have played the instrument,
[54:47] everybody glorifying you and praising
[54:50] you in one way or the other. Father,
[54:53] please accept them. Accept the offering
[54:56] of our purses also. And may you also
[55:00] accept our person. Let nothing, oh God,
[55:04] stand between our soul and the savior.
[55:06] Hallelujah. May you come by in our
[55:09] midst. Have a free flow. Oh God, but
[55:12] don't pass anyone by. May you stop at
[55:16] the post of each individual.
[55:19] May you descend their needs and apply to
[55:22] them the substance of their request and
[55:25] their desires. Lord, you know their
[55:28] needs. I don't know. I pray that you
[55:30] will give me such a yielding that
[55:32] through my vessel, you will express your
[55:35] holy horses. Hallelujah. That will bring
[55:37] healings to the sick. That will bring
[55:40] encouragement to the weary. Restoration
[55:44] to the backslider
[55:46] and edification to the believers. Let
[55:49] there be open heavens. Almighty God, and
[55:52] let your blessings pour upon thy people.
[55:55] Amen. Souls that may still be coming on
[55:58] their way. May you get their part safely
[56:01] here. Those that are in their houses,
[56:03] may you give them a quickening, oh God.
[56:05] Amen. And those who perhaps will be
[56:08] watching this from somewhere, may your
[56:10] people pass from you to us and from us
[56:13] unto them that they might be like
[56:16] partakers of the same blessing that we
[56:18] are going to receive. Are there places
[56:21] where believers are fellowshipping
[56:23] today? Your presence we believe is among
[56:26] us. Let it also be with them that both
[56:29] there and here when the services will be
[56:32] over, we would have caused to give you
[56:34] praise. Amen. We will give you glory.
[56:37] Thank you for our host pastors here.
[56:40] Thank you for everybody who has played
[56:43] one role or the other to make these
[56:46] meetings possible under your providence.
[56:49] Almighty God, I pray that your children
[56:51] will never lose their reward.
[56:53] Hallelujah. Be with us as we open your
[56:55] word now. And may you come out from the
[56:58] pages of the Holy Spirit to reveal
[57:01] yourself to us individually. Amen. The
[57:04] Lord when the services will be over,
[57:06] we'll be lighooted by the energy of the
[57:09] spirit to indeed go and declare through
[57:13] our lives and our testimony that you are
[57:16] alive. You are not dead. Heavenly
[57:18] Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:21] Christ. Amen.
[57:25] [Applause]
[57:29] Bless you, sir.
[57:31] The Lord bless you. I will please
[57:34] request that we read our Bibles so that
[57:37] when you take your seat you sit once and
[57:39] for all and then when we read the
[57:42] scripture together it will help you to
[57:44] get used to my addiction
[57:46] in case you have problem with my accent.
[57:50] All right. The Lord bless you. We
[57:51] welcome ourselves into the house of the
[57:54] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. Okay.
[57:58] If you have your Bibles with you, I want
[58:01] to read uh the same
[58:03] events in the three accounts of the
[58:06] scripture. So I'll start from the book
[58:09] of Matthew chapter 27 verse
[58:15] 50. I want to
[58:18] read three
[58:20] passages given accounts of the same
[58:23] thing
[58:25] uh for which we gathered in this season.
[58:28] Amen.
[58:30] If you are in Matthew chapter
[58:33] 27, I want us to look at the 50th verse.
[58:38] Verse 550.
[58:40] Amen.
[58:45] If you are there, say amen. Amen.
[58:49] Jesus when he had cried again with a
[58:52] loud voice
[58:54] uh yielded up the ghost and behold the
[58:59] veil of the temple was rent in twain
[59:02] from the top to the bottom and the earth
[59:07] did quake and the rocks rent and the
[59:11] graves were opened and many bodies of
[59:14] the saints which slept arose and came
[59:17] out of the grave after his resurrection
[59:21] and went into the holy city and appeared
[59:24] unto many.
[59:26] Amen. Amen. Please take note of that
[59:29] account because each account gave us
[59:32] more information. Amen. All right. Mark
[59:36] chapter 15 verse
[59:42] 37. Mark 15:37.
[59:53] Amen.
[59:56] And Jesus cried with a loud
[59:59] voice and gave up a ghost.
[1:00:03] And the veil of the temple was rent in
[1:00:07] doing from the top to the bottom. Yes.
[1:00:10] And when the centurion which stood over
[1:00:13] against him saw that he so cried out and
[1:00:16] gave up the ghost, he said, "Truly this
[1:00:20] man was the son of God." Amen. That
[1:00:24] looks similar to Matthew 27, isn't it?
[1:00:27] All right, let's progress further. John
[1:00:31] chapter
[1:00:34] 19 from where we shall take our subject
[1:00:39] this morning.
[1:00:43] Hallelujah. John chapter 19 verse 30.
[1:01:03] When Jesus therefore had received the
[1:01:07] venigan,
[1:01:09] he said, "It is finished."
[1:01:12] And he bowed his head and gave up the
[1:01:15] ghost. The Lord add his blessings to the
[1:01:19] reading of his holy word. God bless you.
[1:01:22] May please be seated.
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:30] This morning I want to thank the Lord so
[1:01:34] very much. Yes. For the privilege he has
[1:01:38] given unto us. Amen. Uh to see another
[1:01:41] Easter and the opportunity he gave unto
[1:01:45] me and my wife to be in the midst of the
[1:01:50] believers in this part of the world at
[1:01:53] this time. Amen. Uh I think before the
[1:01:57] foundation of the world, this was where
[1:01:59] God saw us.
[1:02:02] We couldn't have been anywhere
[1:02:04] else but this place. Amen. And uh the
[1:02:09] events that made it possible for us to
[1:02:13] be here today witness to the fact that
[1:02:17] this was the Lord's doing. Hallelujah.
[1:02:19] We applied when the invitation came.
[1:02:24] uh we had to my wife's passport had
[1:02:28] expired so we had to do a renewal and uh
[1:02:33] that left us around March because she
[1:02:36] said to me that she hasn't been to South
[1:02:38] Africa for a long time if I don't mind
[1:02:41] she would like to join me on this trip
[1:02:43] she she really makes such a
[1:02:45] [Music]
[1:02:47] request so maybe a time I have to pull
[1:02:50] her and say come but this time I think
[1:02:53] she loves for South Africans.
[1:02:57] So I said okay. So we got the passport
[1:03:01] renewed and we applied I think uh what I
[1:03:05] can say long time enough. Yeah. In March
[1:03:09] but the for some reasons the visa got
[1:03:13] delayed
[1:03:15] uh and they wouldn't release our
[1:03:17] passport until the visa was ready.
[1:03:21] So it kept on pastoring we asking me is
[1:03:27] everything all right I said everything
[1:03:28] is all right but we are still waiting
[1:03:31] for the visa and we kept waiting until
[1:03:35] this week
[1:03:37] and it looks at a point like well it's
[1:03:40] not going to work so but I remember
[1:03:44] telling the church on
[1:03:47] Sunday I told the believers I said uh
[1:03:51] We are supposed to travel on Wednesday
[1:03:53] but as of today we don't have the visa.
[1:03:56] If there is any of you praying against
[1:03:58] the
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:01] visa I want to please plead with
[1:04:05] you to pray for the visa. You know I was
[1:04:09] just teasing the brethren because some
[1:04:12] of them say okay so pastor you will be
[1:04:14] away you know things like that. So I
[1:04:18] told them but I trust to the Lord that
[1:04:22] God will release the visa and I said uh
[1:04:26] a sister from South Africa called me
[1:04:29] from
[1:04:30] nowhere I think she's here this morning
[1:04:33] sister Rachel I met her for the first
[1:04:35] time and she said uh you know pastor we
[1:04:38] were told you are coming to South Africa
[1:04:42] and we are just looking forward to your
[1:04:44] arrival because I know you will make it.
[1:04:48] So I I kind of take it as a confirmation
[1:04:50] from God that the truth will be
[1:04:53] possible. I even mentioned it to the
[1:04:55] church. I said the sister called and
[1:04:57] said I know you will make it. So I said
[1:04:59] maybe that's the Lord speaking. So I
[1:05:01] want you people who have been praying
[1:05:03] against it to now set us
[1:05:07] free. So everybody said pastor we are
[1:05:10] praying everything will be fine. And I
[1:05:12] said that's fine. I believe as long as
[1:05:14] the Lord want us to be here, he will
[1:05:17] make it possible. So I was given them an
[1:05:19] instance. I said this has happened
[1:05:21] before in 2013 when we were invited in
[1:05:24] Pritoria for a convention also. Uh I
[1:05:28] said the visa got delayed for no reason
[1:05:31] until the day we had to travel. And I
[1:05:34] said it was just 3 hours before our
[1:05:36] trip. Amen. 4 hours before our trip uh
[1:05:40] before the visa. no 3 hours before the
[1:05:42] visa came out. So we asked to go pick
[1:05:45] the visa and drive another 45 minutes to
[1:05:48] the airport from the visa center
[1:05:50] straight. So I said it's still the same
[1:05:52] God.
[1:05:55] [Applause]
[1:05:56] [Music]
[1:05:58] On Monday night, on Monday night after
[1:06:02] work
[1:06:03] hour, after closing hour, we got a
[1:06:07] message from the embassy around 6:00 7
[1:06:09] in the evening that your passports are
[1:06:12] ready
[1:06:14] on Monday night after close. So, I was
[1:06:19] telling my wife, I said, "Did they work
[1:06:20] late today because this is past closing
[1:06:24] hour and we're getting a message." I
[1:06:26] said, "Uh, this this is God there."
[1:06:30] Then something told me where to travel
[1:06:32] on Wednesday. Then something told me
[1:06:34] because later that same night, they
[1:06:37] said, "Your passport has been sent to
[1:06:39] the collection center." That same night
[1:06:42] again around 8:00 p.m. They said, "The
[1:06:45] passport has been picked by the Korea
[1:06:47] company that will deliver it to your
[1:06:49] house." Said, "This is something.
[1:06:56] I was teasing my wife. I said, "I don't
[1:06:58] know Embassy can work till 8 900 p.m. in
[1:07:01] the evening." I said, "This must be
[1:07:03] something unusual." So then something
[1:07:06] told me, he said, "Don't wait for the
[1:07:08] Korea company, otherwise you may have to
[1:07:11] change your ticket." I said, "Really?"
[1:07:14] So I told my wife, I said, "You know
[1:07:16] what? Something told me not to wait for
[1:07:19] the Korea company." He says, "So what
[1:07:21] are you going to do?" I said tomorrow if
[1:07:24] by that's on Tuesday. If by 11:00 a.m. I
[1:07:27] did not hear from them, I will make
[1:07:31] ready by noon and get go to their office
[1:07:36] and demand for a passport. So I didn't
[1:07:40] know it was God speaking. But 11:00 a.m.
[1:07:42] I didn't hear from the Korea company. So
[1:07:47] uh I made ready. I went to the office
[1:07:50] and they said, "What do you want?" And I
[1:07:51] said I want our passports.
[1:07:54] Ah he said why? I said because the
[1:07:56] embassy gave us this message that our
[1:07:59] passports are now with you. So when the
[1:08:01] official they looked at the numbers our
[1:08:05] reference numbers. He said no our
[1:08:08] company don't use this reference number.
[1:08:11] I said so what must I do? He said you
[1:08:14] have to go to the visa collection office
[1:08:17] of the embassy and they will direct you
[1:08:19] where you can pick the visa. So I wanted
[1:08:23] to go then I turned back I said look
[1:08:26] that day when they were filling
[1:08:28] documentation for
[1:08:30] delivery it was your company I saw that
[1:08:34] they wrote even though it's not listed
[1:08:37] here but it's your company I could
[1:08:40] remember vividly it's your company um
[1:08:43] envelope that I saw he said but sir our
[1:08:46] company don't use this reference I said
[1:08:49] do me a favor go inside and check or do
[1:08:52] your findings within your central pool
[1:08:55] before I start traveling all the way for
[1:08:58] another hour to the place said okay God
[1:09:01] granted me favor he said okay sir let's
[1:09:04] do that so he went in took the
[1:09:07] particulars check this check that sent
[1:09:09] it to the central pool they were away
[1:09:12] for about 30 minutes so I was wondering
[1:09:14] what was going on and I wanted to be
[1:09:17] sure they will respond on time so that I
[1:09:19] can get to the collection center before
[1:09:21] 3 because after they close for public so
[1:09:26] now it's getting to 1:00 or past 1 and I
[1:09:29] didn't hear from them so an officer came
[1:09:32] and said sir we're still working on your
[1:09:33] case please bear with us so you know
[1:09:36] what happened after
[1:09:38] about 354 minutes this man came back
[1:09:42] with our two passports
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:49] so I said uh I said so what happened? He
[1:09:53] said it's very unusual. This is not our
[1:09:55] reference numbers but when we sent to
[1:09:58] the central pole they said the passports
[1:10:01] are in here. So we had to go and check
[1:10:04] and we found it. So so we are very
[1:10:05] sorry. I said we could have disturbed
[1:10:08] you a whole day. So I said if you had
[1:10:10] the passport since last night or this
[1:10:13] morning what is it still doing in your
[1:10:15] office? Why don't you send it? He said
[1:10:17] actually we plan to send it on
[1:10:19] Wednesday.
[1:10:20] Then I knew it was God who spoke to me
[1:10:23] on the
[1:10:25] [Applause]
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:28] [Applause]
[1:10:30] you know brought it on Wednesday would
[1:10:32] have missed the flight and they would
[1:10:34] have had to change with all the
[1:10:36] complications. So we saw the hand of God
[1:10:38] in that and uh I want to thank God for
[1:10:41] that.
[1:10:43] [Applause]
[1:10:45] [Music]
[1:10:46] So it's your prayers answered and uh
[1:10:50] want to thank the pastors uh who
[1:10:54] organized this. I know there were quite
[1:10:56] a number of them for the face they put
[1:10:59] to it for me was pastor Marvin, pastor
[1:11:02] Andrean and I want to on their behalf I
[1:11:05] want to thank everyone and all the
[1:11:08] pastors whom they made fit to uh bring
[1:11:11] me into South Africa at this time for
[1:11:14] the purpose of this meetings. I pray
[1:11:16] that the Lord will bless them, their
[1:11:19] wives, their family, and their
[1:11:21] ministries. And I'll be riding on the
[1:11:24] platform that they have built in order
[1:11:26] to be a blessing to the body of Christ.
[1:11:29] I want to appreciate all the servants of
[1:11:31] God who are in the audience, the
[1:11:34] pastors, the ministers. May the Lord
[1:11:36] bless you all and everyone of you have
[1:11:39] taken time to come and be part of the
[1:11:41] meeting. You are such an encouragement
[1:11:43] to me. uh because when we go to town or
[1:11:47] come to a place we are not expecting to
[1:11:50] speak to cheers and to
[1:11:53] enchant for cheers and uh the gospel is
[1:11:57] meant for human beings. So it's always a
[1:11:59] privilege if God give us people to speak
[1:12:01] to. I want you to know that we don't
[1:12:04] take it for granted and uh I will do all
[1:12:07] I can to yield unto God uh so that he
[1:12:10] can truly minister his blessings unto
[1:12:14] the people of God. I bring the greetings
[1:12:17] of the saints back in Nigeria both from
[1:12:19] our local assembly and uh other
[1:12:23] assemblies and many other pastors who
[1:12:25] knew we were coming. They all send their
[1:12:28] greetings to every one of you. They are
[1:12:31] doing very well by God's grace and I
[1:12:33] know they will be happy to know that the
[1:12:35] believers are fine here.
[1:12:38] Thank you all. Welcome in the name of
[1:12:40] Jesus Christ. Yeah. My first time coming
[1:12:44] to South Africa was in 20 uh
[1:12:47] 2005. Uh I was invited by pastor Ron
[1:12:52] Genan who has gone to be with the Lord.
[1:12:55] I salute his memory very greatly and uh
[1:12:59] I came in we never met we never knew
[1:13:02] before but he said he heard about me and
[1:13:06] he felt that I might be of a blessing or
[1:13:09] service to God's people so we came in I
[1:13:12] came with my wife then and then my dear
[1:13:14] missionary partner and great friend
[1:13:17] brother one and we surely had a
[1:13:20] wonderful time do was my first place to
[1:13:22] preach in South Africa And uh we
[1:13:26] certainly had a nice time with the
[1:13:28] saints. We met there. It started from a
[1:13:31] local assembly. Then it went you know
[1:13:34] into a program like this and we're able
[1:13:37] to touch some few places. I had to leave
[1:13:40] with my wife on account of uh uh family
[1:13:43] obligations to put the children back to
[1:13:45] school. But brother one waited he had a
[1:13:48] little more time and uh I think it was a
[1:13:51] nice time and since then I've been
[1:13:53] coming in and out short visit just
[1:13:56] attend to a program and leave and uh I
[1:13:59] thank God we could make it again after
[1:14:01] 20 years
[1:14:03] to this meeting. So the Lord bless you
[1:14:06] and we trust that God will give us a
[1:14:08] refreshing time around his holy word.
[1:14:11] Amen. Amen. All right. From the
[1:14:14] scripture that we've read, uh, if the
[1:14:17] Lord will be our help, which I trust he
[1:14:20] will, I want to speak on a subject that
[1:14:23] I called when the Lord said it is
[1:14:27] finished.
[1:14:29] When the Lord said it is finished. Amen.
[1:14:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:36] If you look at all the scriptures that
[1:14:38] we
[1:14:40] read from Matthew to the book of Mark,
[1:14:45] both scriptures were together in their
[1:14:47] accounts.
[1:14:49] But they never told us what the Lord
[1:14:52] said. Yes. Right. They only told us that
[1:14:56] Jesus cried with a loud voice.
[1:15:00] Yes. Amen. Yes. Amen. But whatever the
[1:15:03] voice represented, yes, whatever that
[1:15:07] voice said, those two scriptures did not
[1:15:10] tell us. Amen.
[1:15:12] Amen.
[1:15:14] So it was a voice.
[1:15:16] But the words were not decoded.
[1:15:20] And sometimes that is the way you get
[1:15:22] God. Yeah. I remember before Alaska sank
[1:15:27] beneath the ocean, it was a voice, a
[1:15:30] noise of thunders that people heard.
[1:15:33] Yes. But it was only the prophet.
[1:15:37] Amen.
[1:15:38] When others were hearing voice, the
[1:15:41] prophet was hearing distinct words.
[1:15:44] Amen.
[1:15:46] From that voice. Are you following me?
[1:15:48] Amen. All right. So uh they had to come
[1:15:53] to the
[1:15:54] prophet. What did he say?
[1:15:58] Because they knew that there must be
[1:16:00] distant words
[1:16:02] in that voice. Amen.
[1:16:06] Yes. But all the people that gather
[1:16:08] around the prophet couldn't tell what it
[1:16:10] said.
[1:16:12] They only heard the voice. Amen. Loud
[1:16:16] voice.
[1:16:20] And they went to the prophet. They said,
[1:16:21] "What did he say?"
[1:16:24] Because they knew that God will not
[1:16:26] thunder for nothing.
[1:16:29] Thunder is the voice of God.
[1:16:33] But what did he say?
[1:16:37] Brother Abraham asked to go to God and
[1:16:39] said, "Brethren, let me ask God if you
[1:16:42] will want me to tell you." Hey, when
[1:16:45] they went to ask God if he would want uh
[1:16:48] him to tell them, God said, "Tell them."
[1:16:50] And all the voices they were hearing
[1:16:53] meant one thing. Judgment striking the
[1:16:56] West Coast. That's right. Amen. That was
[1:17:00] what they heard as voice. Yes. Amen.
[1:17:04] Judgment striking the West Coast. And I
[1:17:07] think two days later, Alaska almost went
[1:17:09] into the ocean. Amen. Amen. To confirm
[1:17:13] what the voice said. So, Matthew told us
[1:17:16] it was a voice.
[1:17:19] Mark told us it was a voice. But God
[1:17:22] won't voice or thunder for nothing. What
[1:17:26] is this voice? Then John. John.
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:32] Who has the most intimate closest
[1:17:35] relationship?
[1:17:39] Amen.
[1:17:40] Yes sir.
[1:17:42] It depends on how close you are related
[1:17:44] to God.
[1:17:47] I want to be slow and easy. We have
[1:17:49] enough time. Amen.
[1:17:52] Amen. It depends on your level of
[1:17:56] relationship with God to understand God.
[1:17:59] Sometimes you know God calls some people
[1:18:03] uh he call them his friends.
[1:18:06] He calls some people brethren. Then he
[1:18:09] calls some people bride
[1:18:12] because the prophet said he said now I
[1:18:14] no longer call you friends. I call you
[1:18:17] bride. Amen. Not bride to the prophet.
[1:18:21] Amen. The prophet is does not have the
[1:18:24] capacity to be your husband.
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:30] He must be somebody who established a
[1:18:33] relationship, a contact between a
[1:18:36] bridegroom and his bride.
[1:18:39] So you a bride to Christ. Now we have
[1:18:41] these three categories of people
[1:18:44] relating to one man and by their
[1:18:47] relation their relationship level will
[1:18:50] determine how much hallelujah they will
[1:18:53] know of and about this man. Yeah. Are
[1:18:57] you with me? All right. Even if you are
[1:19:00] his blood brother,
[1:19:02] it will come to a time that you know
[1:19:05] dressing together will need some sort of
[1:19:08] polite respect. Yes. Yes. Are you here?
[1:19:12] All right. So the only person who can
[1:19:14] enter into a closer with a man and a man
[1:19:18] will unveil himself without any
[1:19:20] reservation. Yes. And without any sense
[1:19:22] of embarrassment
[1:19:24] is his is branch.
[1:19:26] Amen. Glory. Wonderful. You can tell a
[1:19:30] friend, "Excuse me, I want to dress up
[1:19:32] and it wouldn't be an offense." You can
[1:19:35] even tell your brother that. But you
[1:19:37] won't tell your wife that. No.
[1:19:40] Is that right? You tell your wife that
[1:19:42] something is wrong.
[1:19:44] And in these last days, God unveiled
[1:19:46] himself. Mighty God unveiled before.
[1:19:50] unveiling of God. Now, a man doesn't
[1:19:54] unveil himself publicly. Amen. It will
[1:19:58] bad manners. It's a closed relationship.
[1:20:03] So, there's a category of people whose
[1:20:06] relationship level will take them to the
[1:20:08] secret place.
[1:20:12] Okay, we'll come to some things later.
[1:20:14] Let's go on gradually. Amen. But what
[1:20:16] I'm trying to say is
[1:20:19] that Matthew told us it was a voice.
[1:20:23] Yes. Mark told us it was a loud voice.
[1:20:27] But when we came to John Amen. Amen.
[1:20:30] John didn't mention voice.
[1:20:33] He mentioned the words of the voice.
[1:20:36] And what is the words of the voice? He
[1:20:39] said when he said it is finished
[1:20:44] the voice is it is finished.
[1:20:48] [Applause]
[1:20:49] Hallelujah.
[1:20:51] And Abraham said what finished. Let's
[1:20:54] see what finished. Amen. You love him
[1:20:58] this morning.
[1:21:00] Let's see what finished. Praise God.
[1:21:04] Amen.
[1:21:05] He said, "When is he scripted at the
[1:21:07] cross, it is finished." That's the
[1:21:10] prophet speaking. When is he scripted at
[1:21:13] the cross, it is finished. Sin died.
[1:21:17] Hallelujah.
[1:21:18] [Applause]
[1:21:20] Yes. Because the Bible said, "For this
[1:21:23] cause was immanifested."
[1:21:25] Yes. To destroy the work of the devil.
[1:21:31] Hallelujah. So when this script it is
[1:21:33] finished, sin died. Amen. Now it's dead.
[1:21:40] It's done with. It's powerless. It's
[1:21:44] lifeless. Think of it people. That that
[1:21:48] sin, the enemy to human beings is dead
[1:21:51] and lifeless. It has no more effect. It
[1:21:55] cannot. No wonder that the sun shut off
[1:21:58] its vision. The stars will not shine.
[1:22:02] The earth turned black because it was
[1:22:05] all been redeemed.
[1:22:08] [Applause]
[1:22:09] Wonderful.
[1:22:11] So that is why it is important for us to
[1:22:13] look at when he said it is finished.
[1:22:16] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now in
[1:22:19] John in John we had the voice decoded.
[1:22:25] But in Matthew and Mark, we have the
[1:22:29] effect of that voice. So all the
[1:22:33] scriptures are together.
[1:22:35] Matthew, Mark gave us information. Yes.
[1:22:38] On what happened when that voice sounded
[1:22:41] and John told us the works of the voice.
[1:22:46] Now when Jesus said it is finished,
[1:22:49] three things happened. Yes. In three
[1:22:52] different dimensions. Wonderful.
[1:22:55] Praise God. Amen. Amen. Three things
[1:22:58] happened in three different dimensions.
[1:23:02] So I call you to the journey of those
[1:23:04] dimensions. On earth something happens.
[1:23:08] Yes. Underneath the earth something
[1:23:10] happened. Hallelujah. And in glory
[1:23:14] something happened.
[1:23:16] So we have an event in the seventh
[1:23:18] dimension. Yes. It affected the sixth
[1:23:22] dimension as it was then. Yes, it
[1:23:24] affecting it affected the the fourth
[1:23:27] dimension. It affected the fifth
[1:23:30] dimension. Amen. Just one word bearing
[1:23:35] effect in all dimensions.
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:39] On earth, the Bible says the veil of the
[1:23:42] temple renters. Yes. From top to bottom.
[1:23:46] Amen. I like the description of the
[1:23:48] Bible. He's always making it very
[1:23:50] descriptive. Yes.
[1:23:52] so that you won't miss the message. And
[1:23:55] the prophet came and said, "The renting
[1:23:57] from top to bottom shows that it was God
[1:24:01] who rented it."
[1:24:03] Amen.
[1:24:05] Hallelujah. The grave of the temple was
[1:24:08] renting to and from top to bottom. Amen.
[1:24:11] Is that right? Amen. And uh in the in
[1:24:16] below the graves of the saints.
[1:24:21] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:24:23] Not the ones in the fifth dimension,
[1:24:26] the ones in the sixth, the paradise that
[1:24:30] was emptied.
[1:24:32] The graves of the saints were opened.
[1:24:35] Amen. Preparatory for resurrection.
[1:24:40] Just by that word, it is finished.
[1:24:43] And in heaven, the bleeding lamb, yes,
[1:24:47] went to stand before the throne.
[1:24:49] Hallelujah. to make a demand for the
[1:24:52] book that will help him to make a
[1:24:54] redemption.
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:25:01] Amen. And these are the things we're
[1:25:03] going to look at.
[1:25:05] Because we must bring Easter personally
[1:25:08] to you.
[1:25:10] Are you here? Many times we talk about
[1:25:13] historical Easter. Yeah. Yeah. But you
[1:25:16] know what? The last Easter message of
[1:25:19] the prophet was it is the rising of the
[1:25:20] sun. And it got much to do with the
[1:25:24] resurrection of Jesus Christ. Did you
[1:25:27] hear me? It hasn't much to do with the
[1:25:32] resurrection of Jesus Christ. It's got
[1:25:35] more to do with your own resurrection.
[1:25:39] That is why the prophet in the message
[1:25:41] it is the rising of the sun. He said, "I
[1:25:44] want this Easter to mean more yes to you
[1:25:48] than any Easter ever."
[1:25:51] Most Easter that we celebrate is that of
[1:25:54] the resurrection of Christ. But he came
[1:25:57] back in that message. He said what it
[1:25:59] did for him. It has also done for you.
[1:26:05] Yes sir. Amen. Then he said the same
[1:26:08] scripture that applied to the bridegroom
[1:26:10] has also applied to his bride.
[1:26:14] So I'm not speaking on he is risen this
[1:26:17] morning. I'm speaking on she is risen.
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:26] Yes sir. That was the last Easter the
[1:26:29] prophet celebrated
[1:26:31] before he left here. Amen. In 1965, he
[1:26:34] gave a thanksgiving message. Amen. And
[1:26:38] he said, "I want to thank God that what
[1:26:41] God asked me to come and do has been
[1:26:44] accomplished." He said, "God asked me to
[1:26:46] come and establish relationship between
[1:26:49] a heavenly bridegroom and his empty
[1:26:52] bride." And when he saw that
[1:26:55] accomplished, hallelujah, he said, "I
[1:26:57] want to bring a thanksgiving message."
[1:27:00] because he saw his own purpose of coming
[1:27:04] accomplished. Yes, that was why brother
[1:27:06] Brown didn't need to live past 1965
[1:27:09] because he had said earlier that once my
[1:27:12] purpose is accomplished, I don't even
[1:27:14] want to wait another month.
[1:27:17] And when he saw that accomplished, he
[1:27:19] offered a thanksgiving before November
[1:27:22] thanksgiving he had in April
[1:27:25] bringing Easter message said I want this
[1:27:28] Easter to mean more to you. Yes.
[1:27:33] And if you study that message, you know,
[1:27:36] spiritually, you will realize that his
[1:27:38] emphasis was not on Christ resurrected.
[1:27:42] Yes. But he was showing you by the
[1:27:44] resurrection of Christ. How the bride
[1:27:46] has also resurrected. Yes. He said we
[1:27:49] are resurrected out of dark death
[1:27:54] and we have been brought out of the
[1:27:56] economy of love this year that was dead
[1:28:01] into the economy of a bride age where
[1:28:04] the presence of God is
[1:28:09] that is your history and that is what we
[1:28:12] are celebrating
[1:28:14] because what happened to Christ has
[1:28:16] happened to us. Amen. Yes. That's right.
[1:28:20] Glory. So be looking at these things,
[1:28:22] all these dimensional blessings that
[1:28:25] came by the message. It is finished.
[1:28:28] Now
[1:28:30] the
[1:28:32] Easter, it's
[1:28:34] actually as of today the real Easter
[1:28:38] celebrants are the gentile bride of
[1:28:40] Jesus Christ. Amen. Now what we are
[1:28:44] doing as of now meant nothing to the
[1:28:46] Jews. Yes. Yes. Because they deny the
[1:28:50] advent of the Messiah. Amen. So if they
[1:28:53] deny his advent, they also deny his
[1:28:55] resurrection.
[1:28:57] Amen. Because their fathers even though
[1:29:01] they have the witness of the
[1:29:03] resurrection among them. Yes. Yet they
[1:29:05] paid heavy sons of bride.
[1:29:08] It's in your Bible. Amen. The fail sons
[1:29:11] of bride to bribe to suppress the news
[1:29:14] of resurrection. That's right. But the
[1:29:17] news of resurrection is unsuppressible.
[1:29:20] If there's a word like that cannot be
[1:29:23] suppressed. You know why? It was a
[1:29:25] reality.
[1:29:28] The soldiers that were bribed, they saw
[1:29:30] resurrection. They saw it.
[1:29:34] Even those who were bribing, they were
[1:29:36] afraid. Yeah, they knew that he will
[1:29:39] resurrect. That was why they came to
[1:29:41] Pilate. He as that deceiver.
[1:29:45] You see, his death was a problem. Yes,
[1:29:48] his living was a problem. His death was
[1:29:51] a problem, his restoration a problem for
[1:29:55] the critics, for the kingdom of
[1:29:58] darkness. But they couldn't stop him.
[1:30:01] They said that deceiver says
[1:30:04] that if he is killed he will raise the
[1:30:06] church dead.
[1:30:08] Well, who is the deceiver here?
[1:30:11] No, no, no, no. Who is the deceiver
[1:30:13] here? These were the same people who
[1:30:15] denied. Yes. The understanding of what
[1:30:19] he said. Amen. When he said you destroy
[1:30:23] this temple and I will build it in three
[1:30:26] days, do you know they twisted it? Yes.
[1:30:30] to say he said he will destroy our
[1:30:32] temple and rebuild it. And you would
[1:30:36] think they didn't understand what he
[1:30:37] said, but I give you to know they
[1:30:40] understood.
[1:30:41] But they must always look for an
[1:30:43] accusation.
[1:30:45] Anyhow, remember they brought up many
[1:30:48] accusers, but because their words did
[1:30:50] not agree, they started listening to the
[1:30:53] tapes to see if they can pick just one
[1:30:55] thing. Sure.
[1:30:58] And they said this one is enough. Now if
[1:31:01] you think they never understood, they
[1:31:04] came by the same message
[1:31:07] to the pilot and said this deceiver said
[1:31:11] if he is destroyed, he will come up in
[1:31:14] the third day. They were referring to
[1:31:17] the same message they twisted.
[1:31:19] When you lie, you can never be
[1:31:21] consistent.
[1:31:26] No matter no matter how how skillful you
[1:31:29] are in line
[1:31:31] because lying is actually unnatural
[1:31:36] to your human chemistry. It was an
[1:31:39] imposition of a fallen nature. Yes. So
[1:31:42] it will always betray you anytime
[1:31:46] anywhere. That is why you struggle a
[1:31:49] whole lot to maintain the course of
[1:31:51] life. But if you speak the truth, when
[1:31:55] you are sleeping is the truth. When you
[1:31:58] are woken up unconsciously,
[1:32:00] it is still the truth. You will say the
[1:32:03] same thing.
[1:32:07] So this word came and said that deceiver
[1:32:10] said on the 10th day he will rise up. So
[1:32:14] the governor said uh what is that to me?
[1:32:18] We want to make sure that it does not
[1:32:20] rise.
[1:32:22] So they were confused. They have
[1:32:24] nightmares over the night. We have
[1:32:27] killed this man. But if he ever gets up
[1:32:30] as he said, which by their fear they
[1:32:33] knew it was possible.
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:39] So they came around to block the
[1:32:41] resurrection
[1:32:44] so that even if he gets off it will not
[1:32:47] be able to come out and he will by
[1:32:50] suffocation red again.
[1:32:54] That was their skill. That was their
[1:32:56] plan. That was their scheme. But what
[1:32:59] they didn't realize is that many words
[1:33:02] of God were at stake. Yes, sir. That's
[1:33:07] right. Amen. Many things we are at
[1:33:09] stake. If Jesus failed to get up
[1:33:14] and the prophet in the message
[1:33:15] restoration of the bride, he told us
[1:33:18] that God does not struggle
[1:33:21] to bring his word to pass. He said
[1:33:24] anytime he speaks, he allocates a power
[1:33:28] behind that statement. And I tell you,
[1:33:30] God to sleep knowing that when he
[1:33:33] appointed time for that word to fulfill
[1:33:37] is still the power we wake it up.
[1:33:40] Nothing can resist the words of God.
[1:33:45] Just see the Lord and never fail.
[1:33:52] It's a promise for your life. It's a
[1:33:54] promise for anything and God revealed it
[1:33:57] to you on this very time. The strength
[1:34:00] of Israel can never lie.
[1:34:05] If you are rejected this morning, big
[1:34:07] fresh courage because there will be a
[1:34:10] performance of everything God promised.
[1:34:13] No matter what your circumstance is
[1:34:15] showing, we don't live by what we see.
[1:34:19] We don't live by how we feel. We live by
[1:34:22] what we believe.
[1:34:25] came will go. What are circumstances,
[1:34:30] they will grow. Even human beings are
[1:34:33] saying no condition is permanent. The
[1:34:36] only thing permanent is the word of God.
[1:34:42] All things are possible.
[1:34:50] Lord is going to make sure. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:53] So Satan wanted to disprove the words of
[1:34:56] David. Thou will not leave my holy one
[1:34:59] in hell. Neither will you suffer him to
[1:35:02] see corruption. He wanted to disprove
[1:35:04] that. When Job said, I know my redeemer
[1:35:09] and I know in the last days
[1:35:12] I shall
[1:35:13] see. Even though they once destroyed my
[1:35:16] body, yet in this body you must seen
[1:35:20] another body, a better body, a glorified
[1:35:24] body that looks exactly like this one.
[1:35:27] He said, "Yet in my shall I see the
[1:35:30] Lord? Whom I shall see for myself? Whom
[1:35:33] I shall behold and not another."
[1:35:37] Satan wanted to disprove that word.
[1:35:42] Let me tell you there was more stick for
[1:35:44] God than for you.
[1:35:47] And this is the reason God will always
[1:35:50] watch over his work to perform it.
[1:35:54] So, so, so the pilot said what do you
[1:35:58] want me to do? It's like saying your
[1:36:00] troubles are too much.
[1:36:04] You fought this man in life. You are
[1:36:06] fighting him in death. You want to find
[1:36:09] him in resurrection again. What kind of
[1:36:11] a people are you? Said you have the
[1:36:14] watch, you have the soldiers, you have
[1:36:15] everything. Go and seal it. Go and
[1:36:18] protect it as well. Oh, hallelujah. And
[1:36:22] I can see them taking authority.
[1:36:25] And mountain garrisons
[1:36:28] secure the whole place. And they use the
[1:36:32] Roman seal. Yeah. Yeah. Because they got
[1:36:34] the seal of Rome. Yes. and seal the
[1:36:37] grave. That even when he gets up, he
[1:36:40] will die dead.
[1:36:43] Hallelujah.
[1:36:45] But on the third day,
[1:36:48] look at that. On the third day, my Bible
[1:36:52] told me, an angel swept down from glory.
[1:36:57] Right in the presence of the soldiers,
[1:36:59] an angel swept down from glory. We
[1:37:02] become trottting soldiers. We sought
[1:37:06] dropping soldiers and angels fell down
[1:37:08] from glory, broke the seal, blow away
[1:37:12] the soul and sat upon it.
[1:37:15] He call me if you can.
[1:37:19] [Applause]
[1:37:22] He broke the seal. He rolled the stone
[1:37:25] away and it sat upon the stone. Amen.
[1:37:29] That's not even Jesus. That's his angel.
[1:37:38] You You give too much credit to Satan.
[1:37:41] Satan is just a little to
[1:37:44] a to in the hand of God. Do you know
[1:37:48] when people say Satan and God is
[1:37:51] fighting, it's an insult.
[1:37:54] Who fighting who? Can Satan actually
[1:37:57] fight God? It's not possible.
[1:38:01] If God is allowing him, it's because
[1:38:03] he's part of the program.
[1:38:06] When the programs are all done, listen
[1:38:08] to me. God is going to send just one
[1:38:11] ordinary angel.
[1:38:14] The Bible said so. Yes, sir. It didn't
[1:38:16] say it's Gabriel. It's not Michael. He
[1:38:20] said that angel will come and b Satan
[1:38:25] with a chain of circumstance. He will
[1:38:27] leave it in the condition that he cannot
[1:38:30] act for 1,000 years. Ordinary angel will
[1:38:35] b Satan.
[1:38:41] You are telling me Satan is God's
[1:38:43] opponent. When the ordinary angel
[1:38:47] [Applause]
[1:38:53] Hallelujah.
[1:38:56] Oh, this angel came down. He broke the
[1:38:59] seal, rolled away the stone, sat upon
[1:39:03] it. I said, "You guys try me if you and
[1:39:06] the Bible said for his fear all the
[1:39:09] soldiers.
[1:39:14] For God made sure they saw everything
[1:39:16] that happened." Yes. Because there must
[1:39:18] be a report given. Yeah.
[1:39:23] So when they manage to escape for their
[1:39:26] lives,
[1:39:28] they run to their principles.
[1:39:31] So tell you what,
[1:39:33] what do we saw the man
[1:39:37] resurrected
[1:39:40] during that deceiver? Keep quiet. The
[1:39:43] man
[1:39:45] resurrected.
[1:39:47] We saw it came out.
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:56] Did you mean you
[1:39:58] saw him?
[1:40:01] You mean he rose?
[1:40:06] So even the critics knew there was
[1:40:08] resurrection.
[1:40:11] You can't deny it. Now watch what they
[1:40:14] do. So, you know what is going to
[1:40:15] happen? Name your prize.
[1:40:19] The soldier said for what? To deny
[1:40:23] resurrection.
[1:40:28] As they were opening their mouth, ah ah
[1:40:30] they were stomping it with millions of
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:40] R. So what do you want us to see?
[1:40:43] We are going to organize a press
[1:40:45] conference for you. You are going to say
[1:40:49] while you were sleeping,
[1:40:54] his disciples came to steal his body.
[1:40:57] Look at an inconsistent lie again.
[1:41:00] Somebody is sleeping and yet he knew
[1:41:03] those who spoke.
[1:41:06] [Applause]
[1:41:07] Was it in the
[1:41:09] [Applause]
[1:41:13] Whoso coverth sin shall not prosper.
[1:41:18] An attempt to cover sin does not
[1:41:20] prosper.
[1:41:22] Expose sin at the truth so you can
[1:41:26] leave. He said when we were sleeping you
[1:41:30] were sleeping and snoring and yet you
[1:41:33] knew the criminals.
[1:41:36] Does it hard enough? It's not hard
[1:41:39] enough. If you were sleeping, you were
[1:41:41] sleeping. He said while we were
[1:41:43] sleeping, his body was stolen. If you
[1:41:46] could tell who was stealing his body,
[1:41:48] then go arrest them.
[1:41:52] Did you ever hear the disciples were
[1:41:54] arrested? Because they knew they were
[1:41:57] lying.
[1:42:03] But see the effect of lie because many
[1:42:06] loveth evil Yes. more than
[1:42:09] righteousness. The Bible said it became
[1:42:12] a common sin.
[1:42:14] Yes. That his body was stolen.
[1:42:18] Amen. Amen. And even Joseph was and some
[1:42:21] historians began to write that the
[1:42:23] communion they do was the body of Christ
[1:42:26] they preserved and we are cutting small.
[1:42:29] I was wondering how big that body will
[1:42:31] have been to have lasted them the whole
[1:42:35] for communion. Yes. Yes.
[1:42:39] Amen. And you would have expected Jesus
[1:42:42] Christ to do something about it. But God
[1:42:45] does not fight like you fight.
[1:42:52] While that was going on, while the lies
[1:42:54] was going on, the Bible said Jesus was
[1:42:57] appearing to his own. Yes.
[1:43:01] Empowering his own. Yes. So many lies
[1:43:04] are going on in the world. But Christ is
[1:43:07] appearing his own. He's empowering his
[1:43:10] own. He's building a body of an army.
[1:43:14] Who will overrun
[1:43:16] everything the devil can present?
[1:43:20] And for 40 days, he was doing that.
[1:43:25] When he finished, the Bible said he
[1:43:27] left. Yes. Because the job of the
[1:43:30] defense of resurrection
[1:43:33] or the proof of resurrection was not the
[1:43:36] ministry of Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:39] Christ did not die for himself.
[1:43:43] He wasn't buried for himself. He didn't
[1:43:46] resurrect for himself. He did it all for
[1:43:50] you.
[1:43:51] say you are the beneficiary and you are
[1:43:54] going to have the token
[1:43:56] the receipt of resurrection it is when
[1:43:59] you present the token of resurrection
[1:44:02] that indeed the world will know his
[1:44:03] reason
[1:44:05] so for Christ to be provoked to express
[1:44:09] himself he will have broken his own
[1:44:11] program
[1:44:12] so he live quiet while the lies were
[1:44:16] going on but let me tell you Christ will
[1:44:19] never let it have passed.
[1:44:22] He will defend it.
[1:44:25] So when he left when he
[1:44:28] left it sent the evidence of
[1:44:30] resurrection
[1:44:32] yes to the disciples. Yes. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:37] And a a
[1:44:39] scarce denying Peter wax so bold.
[1:44:44] So much so that on the day of Pentecost
[1:44:47] he brought 3,000. Bye bye bye. Then one
[1:44:50] day after Pentecost as they were going
[1:44:52] to the gate beautiful Yes sir. Listen to
[1:44:56] me brethren. They saw a man who was a
[1:45:00] notable living fellow. Amen. Is that
[1:45:03] right? And everybody knew this man. This
[1:45:08] man probably lived when Christ was
[1:45:10] there. Amen. But Christ never raised him
[1:45:13] up because he was meant to be an
[1:45:16] evidence to his resurrection.
[1:45:19] [Applause]
[1:45:23] Glory. Christ does not forget. Amen.
[1:45:26] Neither will he commit omission, error
[1:45:28] of omission or commission. Yes, he knows
[1:45:31] what he's doing. Amen. He never held a
[1:45:33] press conference to show himself. It's a
[1:45:36] lie they are talking about me. I
[1:45:39] actually resurrected. You're a man.
[1:45:42] He never did it. But he did it for
[1:45:45] somebody who was his home. There was a
[1:45:49] Thomas
[1:45:50] in his group. Yes. Who said what are you
[1:45:53] talking about? Except I see that
[1:45:55] fingerprint nail print. Except I see
[1:45:59] inside I will never believe. There was
[1:46:02] one of his own. And the Bible said he
[1:46:05] came. Thomas
[1:46:09] Thomas
[1:46:11] and he said my word and my God. He said
[1:46:14] Thomas don't be faithless
[1:46:16] have faith. Whatever I say can never
[1:46:19] fail. He said now you believe because
[1:46:22] you saw but blessed are those. Jesus was
[1:46:26] speaking of you and I will not see and
[1:46:30] yet we believe. God said if we are
[1:46:35] children of God and sometimes our faith
[1:46:38] level is weakening. He said God will do
[1:46:41] everything he could to give us an
[1:46:44] assurance.
[1:46:45] He's there to tell us he can come to you
[1:46:49] but he doesn't do it for everybody.
[1:46:53] God is only obligated
[1:46:56] to his own seat. He has no obligation to
[1:47:00] the children of K.
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:07] Revelation is only meant for the
[1:47:11] children of God. That is why you see
[1:47:14] God. Amen. When he was here in flesh, he
[1:47:17] speaks in parables in a public
[1:47:20] gathering. Hallelujah. Or when he comes
[1:47:23] into the closeness, he unveils himself.
[1:47:27] He gives revelation of the parable. And
[1:47:30] even the disciples were confused. They
[1:47:33] said, "How come outside you speak in
[1:47:35] paragles and inside you speak in plain
[1:47:38] language?" He said, "The reason is very
[1:47:40] simple. Unto you it is given.
[1:47:46] It's not meant for the outsider, it's
[1:47:49] meant for the insider because it is
[1:47:52] spiritual food in season. Is not
[1:47:56] available in Egypt. It is for goian
[1:47:59] children.
[1:48:01] [Applause]
[1:48:05] Hallelujah.
[1:48:06] So he never had a press conference to
[1:48:09] defend himself. But you know what he
[1:48:11] did? He empowered the generation
[1:48:14] to be with the proof that he is risen.
[1:48:19] So this man at the gate, beautiful, saw
[1:48:23] three men coming, welldressed, nicely,
[1:48:26] nice looking. And the Bible said he
[1:48:28] looked up onto them. Yes. To see he must
[1:48:32] have sized them all. This one in the
[1:48:34] middle might be able to give 20 rounds.
[1:48:37] This one on the left, the way I'm
[1:48:38] sitting, he could afford 50. And maybe
[1:48:40] this one on the left, on the right,
[1:48:42] could do 100. But in between them,
[1:48:45] between 150 to 200 G will be here. Yeah.
[1:48:48] Yeah,
[1:48:49] I don't know the value of your money.
[1:48:51] Maybe it's something big or something.
[1:48:53] But whatever it is, you feel it should
[1:48:55] be there. But I when they when the men
[1:48:58] approached,
[1:48:59] they said silver and
[1:49:06] gold. Amen. As big as you are,
[1:49:12] as nicely dressed as you are, oh God,
[1:49:16] things are not working for you in why
[1:49:18] don't you go back to your village.
[1:49:24] But before he could finish his thoughts,
[1:49:26] they said, "Such as we have,
[1:49:30] they don't have silver, they don't have
[1:49:33] gold, or they've got a proof
[1:49:36] of resurrection.
[1:49:37] [Applause]
[1:49:40] They got a token, they got the heavens,
[1:49:43] such as we have, we give unto you in the
[1:49:47] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. rise
[1:49:52] up
[1:49:53] and walk.
[1:49:55] And the Bible said
[1:49:58] a surge of energy came on the man and
[1:50:01] maybe he struggled to get up and they
[1:50:03] give him a hand and he began to lift. He
[1:50:06] began to walk. He began to praise the
[1:50:08] Lord.
[1:50:10] And in doing that his legs come fully
[1:50:13] straightened
[1:50:17] and it became a news everywhere. These
[1:50:20] old guys were confused again. We
[1:50:24] touched, we touched, we touched. Amen.
[1:50:26] Said, "Go arrest those guys."
[1:50:29] And you know what? When they blocked
[1:50:31] them, they were interested in only one
[1:50:33] thing. The Bible said that a notable
[1:50:36] miracle was done. They couldn't deny,
[1:50:40] but they wanted to know how. In what
[1:50:42] name?
[1:50:48] Satan fought that name in Genesis.
[1:50:52] Hallelujah.
[1:50:54] He fought it in the beginning of the
[1:50:55] Bible. He fought it in the middle of the
[1:50:58] Bible. He spoke blasphemy against it in
[1:51:02] the book of Revelation. In what name?
[1:51:07] And Peter said, "You really want to
[1:51:09] know? Amen. You really want to know, we
[1:51:11] are not afraid to tell you.
[1:51:14] Now you organize press conference. Let
[1:51:17] us tell you, everybody must gather.
[1:51:20] Amen. And he said, you see, uh don't
[1:51:23] think it is by our own power.
[1:51:26] That we raise up this man. But in the
[1:51:29] name of Jesus,
[1:51:32] wait for it. Who you crucify?
[1:51:36] For the Lord raised from the dead.
[1:51:40] Hallelujah.
[1:51:42] So all the blood they p was wasted
[1:51:46] because here in the public is the news
[1:51:49] of the resurrection and the evidence of
[1:51:52] resurrection whom you crucified but our
[1:51:57] Lord raised. So Jesus rest, Jesus raised
[1:52:03] Jesus resurrect
[1:52:06] [Applause]
[1:52:07] through faith in his name. This man is
[1:52:10] standing today. Hallelujah. God knows
[1:52:13] how to fight his battle.
[1:52:15] Amen. And on and on. The proof of the
[1:52:19] resurrection ran through seven church
[1:52:21] ages. Yes. Till it came to this last
[1:52:24] church. So we become the final proof.
[1:52:27] Yes. that he is alive. He is not dead.
[1:52:32] God bless you.
[1:52:42] Okay. Okay. Pream done.
[1:52:48] Are you still okay to pray a little
[1:52:50] more?
[1:52:52] Amen. Praise the Lord. So we said when
[1:52:56] it declared it is finished
[1:53:00] it affected several dimensions.
[1:53:03] The first
[1:53:05] dimension that was quickly noticeable
[1:53:08] was on the earth when the veil of the
[1:53:11] temple entered.
[1:53:13] We'll deal with that this morning. Amen.
[1:53:17] Then the graves of the saints were
[1:53:19] opened.
[1:53:21] Then all glory, the bleeding lamb stood
[1:53:24] before the
[1:53:27] to take the book. Lord,
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:35] the veil of the temple that rented
[1:53:38] was not the veil of the outer court.
[1:53:43] There was actually no veil in the outer
[1:53:45] court. Amen.
[1:53:47] Was not a veil in the middle court, but
[1:53:51] it is the veil that separated the middle
[1:53:54] court from the holiest of the holy.
[1:53:58] Amen.
[1:54:02] [Music]
[1:54:04] Hallelujah.
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:07] Hallelujah.
[1:54:10] I know you understand that. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:13] Now why did the
[1:54:16] veil have to read
[1:54:20] it in the book of
[1:54:23] Genesis when men fell.
[1:54:26] Amen. Or before men fell.
[1:54:32] God put his son Adam on the earth. Amen.
[1:54:36] You are familiar with him. Amen. And his
[1:54:39] wife which was called the woman. Yes.
[1:54:42] She wasn't Eve.
[1:54:44] Amen. Eve was a name adopted after the
[1:54:48] fall. When she became the mother of all
[1:54:51] living, meaning she become the mother of
[1:54:54] the good and the bad. Inside her was the
[1:54:57] seed of God through Adam and the seed of
[1:55:00] Satan through the serpent.
[1:55:03] That was what gave her the name Eve.
[1:55:06] But her original name speaking was
[1:55:09] woman. something taken out of the man.
[1:55:14] Are you with me?
[1:55:16] Now, God was happy to live in heaven,
[1:55:20] but he needed a governor on the earth.
[1:55:24] Amen. And if you could get the right
[1:55:26] governor, he's pleased to stay there.
[1:55:29] Amen. Amen. While his son take charge
[1:55:32] here. Amen. And that was why when they
[1:55:35] brought Adam, he brought him in a full
[1:55:38] adopted mode. Yes. He didn't have to
[1:55:41] grow. No. He came grown. It's the ground
[1:55:46] running. Because he was the son of God.
[1:55:49] Yes. In all sense of the word. Amen.
[1:55:52] That was why his first appearance in the
[1:55:54] garden. Yes. Was a spirit being because
[1:55:57] it was a scoop taken out of God. Spirit
[1:56:01] begot spirit. Yes. Are you with me? But
[1:56:04] now being in the spirit form, he will
[1:56:07] not be able to relate with things that
[1:56:09] are physical, tangible, and earthly.
[1:56:12] So in order for there to be fellowship,
[1:56:15] God had to condense his makeup and make
[1:56:18] him look like his subject.
[1:56:23] It was all God's plan. I hope I'm making
[1:56:25] it simple enough. It was all God's plan
[1:56:29] and design. Amen. Amen. Then God
[1:56:33] put when God was to bring his wife, he
[1:56:37] didn't bring that wife as a watch
[1:56:42] right from his person,
[1:56:44] right from his being like he did the
[1:56:47] man. Yeah. Amen. And that is the use of
[1:56:50] the word. That is why the prophet used
[1:56:52] the word byproduct. It's not a
[1:56:54] derogatory word. It's to show that
[1:56:57] something was taken out of something.
[1:57:00] Yes.
[1:57:02] Amen. Amen. But they are all origin.
[1:57:05] It's all from God. Because when Adam was
[1:57:08] here as a spirit man, even when he was
[1:57:10] put in the body of flesh, he had both
[1:57:13] feminine and the masculine spirit all
[1:57:16] enclosed in him.
[1:57:18] Are you with me? That was why the
[1:57:20] scripture was using day for a singular
[1:57:23] person.
[1:57:25] You have male and female created in
[1:57:27] them.
[1:57:29] And he was referring to only one person
[1:57:32] because this one person carries the two
[1:57:36] and through a process of
[1:57:39] surgery anesthetics
[1:57:42] and surgery the wife of Adam was brought
[1:57:46] out of Adam. Now the prophet told us
[1:57:49] that there was a reason why our
[1:57:53] creation had to go through that level of
[1:57:55] condescension.
[1:57:57] Amen. Amen. Because in God's back touch,
[1:58:01] he is to use her as a tool to bring his
[1:58:06] total mind.
[1:58:10] Amen. Satan never had any chance in this
[1:58:13] program.
[1:58:15] When you look at what you know what
[1:58:17] happened, you will thank God that you on
[1:58:20] the sight of God's righteousness
[1:58:23] because it was the God who made all for
[1:58:27] his own pleasure.
[1:58:29] Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:58:32] Satan bringing an interruption to God's
[1:58:35] program as we say is not by his own
[1:58:38] capacity.
[1:58:40] It is God himself who upset his own
[1:58:43] program.
[1:58:44] [Music]
[1:58:46] Satan lacks the capacity to do it. God
[1:58:49] wanted to eat his cake and have it back.
[1:58:54] And he actually did. Yes. Because in the
[1:58:57] beginning, the prophet said God loves
[1:59:00] two desires.
[1:59:03] You with me?
[1:59:05] He has a desire to be God. Yes. And he
[1:59:08] has a desire to be known beyond being
[1:59:10] God. Yes.
[1:59:13] Because inside him we are enclosed with
[1:59:16] many attributes. Attribute means
[1:59:18] abilities.
[1:59:20] Amen. Amen. But as long as perfection
[1:59:25] remains, yes, all those other attributes
[1:59:28] of God cannot be expressed.
[1:59:32] And let me tell you, it is the
[1:59:34] expression of those attributes that
[1:59:36] actually connected us in intimacy with
[1:59:39] God. Thank you. Otherwise we will
[1:59:42] worship him like religion a distant god
[1:59:47] who will only give him sacrifice
[1:59:50] he has no relationship with us but god
[1:59:53] wanted to be related with you
[1:59:56] and the holy man can be related with you
[2:00:00] is to express his attributes
[2:00:02] but those attributes cannot be expressed
[2:00:06] except there's a form yes amen Amen.
[2:00:10] Because he has an ability to heal the
[2:00:13] people. If nothing ever get sick, we
[2:00:17] wouldn't need that.
[2:00:19] He can save. If nothing is lost, there's
[2:00:23] nothing to say. He can redeem. If
[2:00:26] nothing is out of place, there's nothing
[2:00:28] to bring back.
[2:00:31] You can deliver. If nothing gets in
[2:00:34] bondage, there's nothing to
[2:00:37] deliver. Amen.
[2:00:40] So God has to create a condition to
[2:00:43] offset his own affection.
[2:00:46] [Applause]
[2:00:50] You can see that Satan wasn't in the
[2:00:52] picture.
[2:00:54] This was way back in eternity.
[2:00:58] So Lucifer becoming Satan wasn't
[2:01:01] accidental.
[2:01:02] It was all in the plan.
[2:01:06] Amen.
[2:01:08] Hallelujah. That was why the prophet
[2:01:10] used the language when describing the
[2:01:12] work of Satan in the garden. He said,
[2:01:15] "And when Satan has brought to pass that
[2:01:18] which was necessary Yes. to the purpose
[2:01:21] of God. That's right. Yes.
[2:01:24] Some things are necessary to the purpose
[2:01:27] of God in your life. Amen. And there
[2:01:31] will be things that are upsetting.
[2:01:34] There will be things that are negative,
[2:01:37] but because your salvation is already
[2:01:40] finished.
[2:01:41] There is no circumstance on earth,
[2:01:44] whether good or bad that can send you to
[2:01:48] hell. That is the living that we know
[2:01:53] that all things.
[2:01:55] Did you ever read that in the Bible? All
[2:01:58] things, all means all inside. You have
[2:02:02] the good, the bad, the ambivalence
[2:02:05] is above all things work together for
[2:02:09] good.
[2:02:11] Your failures work together for good.
[2:02:14] Your success work together for good.
[2:02:18] Your abilities work together for good.
[2:02:21] Your insufficiency work together for
[2:02:23] good. For them that love God, for them
[2:02:27] who are de
[2:02:32] By the way, not anybody
[2:02:35] to the predestinated.
[2:02:38] That is why Paul
[2:02:41] said what can sound
[2:02:46] that thing hasn't been created.
[2:02:48] Hallelujah. And will never be created.
[2:02:51] Does it make us complicit? No sir. It
[2:02:54] makes us understand the mysteries of
[2:02:56] life so that even sometimes in our
[2:02:59] failure we don't allow the devil to take
[2:03:01] advantage
[2:03:04] and send us into an oblivion.
[2:03:07] Amen. He said if the righteous fall
[2:03:10] seven times he will do what? He will
[2:03:14] rise seven times.
[2:03:17] The difference between us and Satan is
[2:03:20] this. When Satan fell, he never rose
[2:03:23] again.
[2:03:30] Satan permanently.
[2:03:32] But when a believer fall, he will rise
[2:03:35] up. This is the difference.
[2:03:39] Hallelujah.
[2:03:41] Hallelujah.
[2:03:44] Amen.
[2:03:46] So,
[2:03:49] the Lord brought her The Lord brought
[2:03:51] the woman and he also created a creature
[2:03:55] called the serpent not the snake.
[2:04:02] Amen. It was the serpent. And what is
[2:04:06] the essence of this serpent? In the me
[2:04:08] serpent said, brother Ara said it was a
[2:04:11] creation animal that was created with
[2:04:14] the knowledge of the understanding of
[2:04:16] the principles of life. Yes, sir.
[2:04:20] Amen. Yes. Yes. He knows what to do with
[2:04:23] every member of his body. He doesn't
[2:04:26] need an outside intelligence
[2:04:28] to teach him. It was all inherent. And
[2:04:31] why did God make him like that? For the
[2:04:33] devil to find a tool tool when he comes
[2:04:37] into the garden. Yes. Because Lord knows
[2:04:40] he will come.
[2:04:44] Do you hear me?
[2:04:46] The iniquity that was found in the devil
[2:04:49] didn't take place on the earth. It
[2:04:51] started right from heaven. So the Lord
[2:04:54] knew it will come. And he made something
[2:04:57] useful for him. Amen. So when the devil
[2:05:01] is claiming victory, God is laughing in
[2:05:03] the background.
[2:05:05] This guy doesn't even understand that
[2:05:08] I'm only using him to bring to pass my
[2:05:11] own purpose.
[2:05:14] Satan is the dumbest.
[2:05:16] [Applause]
[2:05:20] When he created a woman, brother says,
[2:05:23] when he created a woman, some features
[2:05:26] were necessary. Yes. That will be
[2:05:28] catalyst for the fall. That's right. But
[2:05:31] his holiness couldn't put it. He allowed
[2:05:34] the devil to make an impute. That is why
[2:05:37] sisters don't glory in their beauty and
[2:05:40] they don't worship their beauty. You
[2:05:42] have figured
[2:05:44] [Applause]
[2:05:45] if you are doing that you are becoming
[2:05:49] an unconscious tool of the devil
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:05:56] that is why sisters don't worship
[2:05:58] compliments
[2:06:00] especially from strangers.
[2:06:03] [Applause]
[2:06:04] There are people who are alien to our
[2:06:06] divine economy.
[2:06:08] Hallelujah.
[2:06:10] The Bible said outside the dog eats dog.
[2:06:14] So when they complimenting you, they are
[2:06:17] putting you up for a showdown.
[2:06:20] Hallelujah. Those shapes and things you
[2:06:22] are worshiping, they are actually giving
[2:06:25] you by the devil. That's the message.
[2:06:30] And said, you can be a big truth to God
[2:06:34] or you can be a big truth to Satan. The
[2:06:37] choice has to be by you. Amen.
[2:06:42] Hallelujah.
[2:06:44] Now staying up there,
[2:06:47] he gave his power,
[2:06:50] all his rights, all his authority to one
[2:06:54] man called Adam. Yes. The prophet said
[2:06:58] Adam held the title dude of the earth.
[2:07:01] Amen. We call it certificate of
[2:07:04] occupancy. Some call it title. Whatever
[2:07:06] it is, it's what confers ownership from
[2:07:10] the roots.
[2:07:13] Amen. Amen. So,
[2:07:17] but when it fell, Amen. Amen.
[2:07:22] The prophet said is built a title.
[2:07:27] But before the devil could get a hold,
[2:07:32] the Lord strikes them from glory.
[2:07:35] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And took a
[2:07:38] title.
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:42] Amen.
[2:07:45] So Satan lost. That's right. And that is
[2:07:48] why today is a scatter. Yes. He's not
[2:07:51] the owner. He might be the God of this
[2:07:54] evil age. He's only the God of cosmos.
[2:07:59] He's not the owner of the earth. This
[2:08:02] earth belong to us.
[2:08:05] Let me tell you even in our falling
[2:08:08] state we on the earth
[2:08:12] that is why our eternity will not be
[2:08:15] spent in heaven. It will be spent on
[2:08:18] earth. Hallelujah.
[2:08:21] After the Lord renovated, we shall be
[2:08:24] back there.
[2:08:26] And Jesus is not going to live in
[2:08:28] heaven. He's going to live right here.
[2:08:34] Hallelujah.
[2:08:40] Hallelujah. When the title
[2:08:44] left, man lost his ability to hold on to
[2:08:48] the control. Yes. Of the earth. When he
[2:08:53] was in
[2:08:54] hability, he didn't need any technology.
[2:08:58] Yes. To assist his living. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:01] Church Adam lives by spoken word
[2:09:06] and we have the spoken word restor.
[2:09:09] We are living by spoken word connecting
[2:09:13] back to our beginning. Hallelujah.
[2:09:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Everything Adam
[2:09:19] wanted was by his mouth.
[2:09:24] Amen.
[2:09:25] If he's going in the midst of the garden
[2:09:28] and maybe the three have grown and so
[2:09:30] flourish
[2:09:32] until the branches are covering his
[2:09:34] pathway. It doesn't need a maj.
[2:09:37] It doesn't need an axe to prune the
[2:09:39] branches of the tree. All it does tree
[2:09:43] adjust yourself.
[2:09:45] The tree will look master.
[2:09:50] The prophet said everything obeys Adam.
[2:09:56] Are you with me? If he's passing through
[2:09:59] and maybe a big river or sea is on his
[2:10:02] path, it doesn't need a
[2:10:04] can a boat or ship. He just keep
[2:10:08] walking.
[2:10:09] And it is the waters that will be
[2:10:11] saying, "Oh, master is coming. What must
[2:10:15] I do?
[2:10:16] Shall I gather more gravity under me to
[2:10:20] hold him while he walks over me? Or
[2:10:22] shall I just open up for him so that he
[2:10:25] goes through a dry ground.
[2:10:27] [Applause]
[2:10:30] He's looking too real. He's looking too
[2:10:33] material. My brother, God gave you a
[2:10:36] Moses
[2:10:37] who opens the sea. He gave you a Peter
[2:10:42] who walked around the sea. He gave you a
[2:10:45] Joshua who spoke to the son.
[2:10:48] All those were sons of Ed to show to you
[2:10:53] how it was in the beginning and
[2:10:56] for a return.
[2:10:58] [Applause]
[2:10:59] [Music]
[2:11:01] [Applause]
[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:07] That's how it's going to be, friends.
[2:11:09] That's what the prophet said. Time is
[2:11:12] coming that missing limbs. Yes. Not by
[2:11:16] surgery
[2:11:18] will be restored again.
[2:11:21] He said now we pray. He said then we
[2:11:24] shall speak.
[2:11:26] Time is coming that our needs will not
[2:11:30] be met. We looking for money to give
[2:11:33] money. We'll just speak and heaven will
[2:11:37] respond.
[2:11:39] We are on our road. Yes. If we're not
[2:11:42] arriving yet,
[2:11:44] that's divine program.
[2:11:49] Glory.
[2:11:50] Hallelujah.
[2:11:52] Let me tell you, there is nothing
[2:11:54] waiting for you in the future that you
[2:11:56] cannot be that you cannot start enjoying
[2:11:59] in new forms.
[2:12:01] Otherwise, earnestness of redemption and
[2:12:04] fullness of redemption doesn't make
[2:12:06] sense. That's right. Yes. The ears is to
[2:12:09] give you a forage
[2:12:11] of the greater things that are waiting
[2:12:13] in the future.
[2:12:16] This is why we must be having some
[2:12:17] blessings now.
[2:12:21] [Applause]
[2:12:22] Change your mindset
[2:12:24] because the Lord is on the
[2:12:27] Lord has done his restoration. Yes.
[2:12:32] So
[2:12:34] the title was spilled away. And as a
[2:12:38] mark for that, the Bible said God
[2:12:42] mounted God said man has touched the
[2:12:46] tree of knowledge of good and evil. Lest
[2:12:49] he put forth his hand
[2:12:52] into the tree of life. Hallelujah. in
[2:12:55] his sinful estate.
[2:12:57] And there will be a carrier of God's
[2:12:59] revelation
[2:13:01] and eternal life. He said, "Let us block
[2:13:04] the path." Yes. Amen. Amen. Wonderful.
[2:13:07] So the path to the tree of life was
[2:13:10] blocked by two childrens.
[2:13:12] Amen. That's what the Bible said. Yes.
[2:13:15] So that man in all his movement will not
[2:13:18] be able to go towards that direction.
[2:13:19] Yes. But I want you to know it wasn't
[2:13:22] God's intention to permanently block it.
[2:13:25] [Music]
[2:13:27] So as a memorial of blockage, listen to
[2:13:30] me, God in order to carry that memorial
[2:13:33] with his people, he started signifying
[2:13:36] it through types and shadow.
[2:13:39] So when they started their journey in
[2:13:42] Israel, he brought it back as a
[2:13:45] tabernacle in the wilderness.
[2:13:47] Amen. He said when you create the
[2:13:49] tabernacle make three courts.
[2:13:52] That is the t you saw this morning that
[2:13:54] we read about the veil of the temporary
[2:13:57] make it into three court. Do you know
[2:13:59] that the first two courts is accessible?
[2:14:03] Amen. One accessible by the congregation
[2:14:07] the other by the ministers but the third
[2:14:10] court is only accessible by the high
[2:14:13] priest.
[2:14:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And until the
[2:14:18] high priest accesses that place once in
[2:14:21] a year, the people are not righteous,
[2:14:25] the people are not confirmed holy. Their
[2:14:28] sacrifice is not acceptable.
[2:14:32] So worship is not complete. Yes. Until
[2:14:35] we get into the holiest of the holies.
[2:14:40] Are you with me?
[2:14:42] Worship is not perfected
[2:14:44] and no man can become perfect until we
[2:14:48] get into the holiness of the holy. The
[2:14:51] holiest of the holies all through the
[2:14:53] old testament was packed as a memorial.
[2:14:56] But nobody could go in there. Even the
[2:14:59] high priest that went had to be sure of
[2:15:02] what he was doing because mistakes were
[2:15:05] not
[2:15:08] allowed. Amen.
[2:15:16] And people live by this memorial
[2:15:19] all through. What was in the holiest of
[2:15:20] the holies?
[2:15:22] The heart. Amen. Amen. The cover of the
[2:15:26] heart had two children using their wings
[2:15:29] to cover. And what was inside? A portion
[2:15:32] of the man that was preserved that can
[2:15:36] never decay was placed inside the house
[2:15:40] covered by the cherub signifying the
[2:15:43] tree of life again
[2:15:47] but it wasn't God's intention to
[2:15:50] permanently keep it
[2:15:53] because until it is partaken of yes or
[2:15:57] parttook of by you and me our
[2:16:00] relationship with him is not complete.
[2:16:03] Amen. This is why the prophet said,
[2:16:06] "Amen, the man who comes into the outer
[2:16:09] court,
[2:16:11] repenting and taking the name of the
[2:16:14] Lord in water baptism, he said he has
[2:16:17] tried, he has left the world, he's
[2:16:20] coming to God, but we cannot trust his
[2:16:23] experience." You know why? Yes. Even
[2:16:27] though he's been baptized
[2:16:29] into the fellowship of the saints, and
[2:16:32] we now call him brother, we call him, we
[2:16:35] call her sister, yet the root of sin is
[2:16:39] still inside of us. Is still inside of
[2:16:43] him. Sin can still come as a grave.
[2:16:49] Amen. Hallelujah. That's right. But is
[2:16:51] our brother is our sister inducted to
[2:16:55] our fellowship by water baptism. But in
[2:16:58] the real sense of the word is not yet a
[2:17:01] Christian. That's right.
[2:17:06] And you have them in the church.
[2:17:08] Hallelujah. They still crave to do those
[2:17:11] things. They still want to live immoral.
[2:17:14] They still want to dress the border.
[2:17:16] They still want to smoke. They still
[2:17:18] want to do all the things of the Lord.
[2:17:20] But they love the Lord. When they in the
[2:17:22] house of God, they just want to serve
[2:17:24] God. By the feel of the environment,
[2:17:28] they can go on a high up. But the moment
[2:17:30] they go out, it's it's over. If you are
[2:17:35] like that this morning, there is hope
[2:17:37] for you. You said is it natural? No, it
[2:17:41] is natural. You are just at the stage.
[2:17:45] But a journey has begun. If you can hold
[2:17:48] on in faith, grace will carry you
[2:17:51] through.
[2:17:55] Hallelujah.
[2:17:56] [Applause]
[2:17:58] When that man or that woman
[2:18:02] you know stays in there, the prophet
[2:18:04] said is at the mercy of the weather
[2:18:08] because in the outer court there's no
[2:18:10] covering.
[2:18:12] So sometimes it is too sunny. It feels
[2:18:15] the heat.
[2:18:17] and it's hot inside.
[2:18:19] Sometimes it is too cold. He feels the
[2:18:22] chill and he becomes touch inside. His
[2:18:26] experience is undulated and controlled
[2:18:28] by changes in way.
[2:18:30] So you can't really trust him. But one
[2:18:34] day he moves into the middle court. In
[2:18:38] the middle court there is covering is no
[2:18:42] under the mercy of the winner. Yes. But
[2:18:45] it comes under the mercy of the golden
[2:18:47] lampstand.
[2:18:49] But you see this golden lampstand
[2:18:52] also needs maintenance.
[2:18:56] So it's not a perfect economy here. You
[2:18:59] got to maintain him all the time. The
[2:19:01] pastor has to check on him all the time.
[2:19:04] Brother, how are you doing? Is
[2:19:06] everything getting better? Tell me
[2:19:08] something is wrong. I can pray with you.
[2:19:10] I can pray for you. So every now and
[2:19:13] then you must watch it. The prophet said
[2:19:18] you need to keep pouring oil
[2:19:20] into the golden lampster into the
[2:19:24] lampster to maintain the light. And he
[2:19:26] said he said watch sometimes the wicks
[2:19:29] that carry the oil into the fire could
[2:19:32] sometimes get carbonized
[2:19:34] and if you are not careful to peel the
[2:19:36] carbon you can have a conflration. That
[2:19:40] is why sometimes you stay months and you
[2:19:43] feel that this is like heaven to me and
[2:19:46] after some months you find yourself
[2:19:48] doing things that are funny or if
[2:19:51] pressure comes your way and you just
[2:19:53] give in. Pastor, I thought I was a
[2:19:55] Christian.
[2:20:00] Hallelujah.
[2:20:03] But don't worry, you are still on the
[2:20:05] job.
[2:20:07] That negro sister said, I want to thank
[2:20:10] the Lord
[2:20:12] that even though I am not yet what I
[2:20:14] should be
[2:20:16] but I want to thank God I am not what I
[2:20:19] used to be.
[2:20:21] So the journey has started. If you keep
[2:20:24] waiting on God, if you don't get the
[2:20:27] story, you will strike it one. It may be
[2:20:31] in this service that some of you will
[2:20:34] strike it and you will have it from that
[2:20:37] time.
[2:20:39] [Music]
[2:20:39] [Applause]
[2:20:42] My brother, my sister, when that person
[2:20:45] moves from the middle court and it comes
[2:20:48] into the holiest of the holies,
[2:20:51] Oh hallelujah.
[2:20:54] The root of that sin, not only the
[2:20:57] branches approach, but what makes him
[2:21:00] live like that, it's uprooted
[2:21:04] completely by the fires of God. And the
[2:21:08] spirit of the Lord takes his occupation
[2:21:12] and starts expanding
[2:21:14] from that time. Sin does not come from
[2:21:17] inside.
[2:21:19] It doesn't come as a blame. It could be
[2:21:21] bothered about the challenges outside.
[2:21:24] Listen to me. Because it carries a body
[2:21:27] that is irredeemable.
[2:21:29] The redemption of our body is a change
[2:21:32] of our body. Are you with me? As long as
[2:21:36] we live here with tongs of the Holy
[2:21:39] Ghost, this one is unredeemable. The
[2:21:42] best that can happen to your flesh is a
[2:21:45] subjection. Yes. But it takes an inner
[2:21:48] power. It takes he that is in you that
[2:21:52] is greater than the flesh that is
[2:21:54] greater than this world. The world
[2:21:56] around you is your body. Hallelujah. He
[2:22:00] that is in you is greater than the
[2:22:03] world. It takes that one to put this
[2:22:05] under subjug.
[2:22:08] When this one see evil, he wants to
[2:22:11] fellowship. But because the householder
[2:22:13] is Christ, you will say not here. Get
[2:22:17] out of here.
[2:22:21] You cannot stop evil thoughts from
[2:22:24] flying.
[2:22:25] But you can stop it from roosting.
[2:22:29] You can stop him from establishing it.
[2:22:33] Hallelujah. So what defies you does not
[2:22:37] come from inside the head. What can
[2:22:39] challenge you is from outside. And it
[2:22:42] has a collaborator on your body. But
[2:22:44] because the greater one is in there,
[2:22:47] hallelujah. It will put your body under
[2:22:50] subjection. And as your body begin to
[2:22:53] get used to the new order. Hallelujah.
[2:22:58] Hallelujah. It start a repellent.
[2:23:01] Hallelujah. And you begin to receive
[2:23:03] more of the word. As more of the word
[2:23:06] comes, more of the devil disappear. Yes,
[2:23:10] said don't struggle to quit anything.
[2:23:13] Just keep accepting the way. Keep
[2:23:15] accepting the way. It brings more of
[2:23:18] God. It brings more of God. until one
[2:23:22] day you will testify it is no longer I
[2:23:27] that liveth but
[2:23:33] that is that man that is that woman in
[2:23:36] the holiest of the holies that is the
[2:23:39] proof of his resurrection
[2:23:42] so these articles were carried
[2:23:45] as a memorial till our lord came
[2:23:52] Glory
[2:23:53] in the heart the cherubamies were still
[2:23:55] guarding the tree of life. Amen. In that
[2:23:59] heart in the holiness of the holiness
[2:24:02] symbolizes that the path to the tree of
[2:24:04] life was actually still
[2:24:08] why will it be
[2:24:09] gathered? Because there must be a
[2:24:12] perfect atonement. Yes.
[2:24:15] To release it. Amen. Amen. Amen. The
[2:24:18] blood of bulls and lambs only made a
[2:24:20] covering. We need something that will
[2:24:23] not only breach the chasm or remove it
[2:24:26] completely. Hallelujah. That's what we
[2:24:28] need. And we saw our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:24:31] coming
[2:24:33] and he came healing the sick, raising
[2:24:34] the dead and everybody got happy and
[2:24:37] excited and they could testify to the
[2:24:39] goodness of the Lord. But friends, that
[2:24:42] wasn't why he came. Amen. Amen. Those
[2:24:45] were just attraction. Amen. To show to
[2:24:48] the people that the savior has arrived
[2:24:53] the lamb of God that will carry away the
[2:24:56] sin of the world. He will die as a lamb
[2:24:59] but he will be buried as a ghost.
[2:25:06] Brother said all the shadows of the old
[2:25:08] testament has got to be fulfilled. He
[2:25:12] said in the old testament you have two
[2:25:14] goals. When it comes to scapegoat
[2:25:16] theory, that's right. The Bible didn't
[2:25:18] use a lamp there. He used two goats, he
[2:25:21] said one will be killed and the blood of
[2:25:24] the one killed will be put upon the one
[2:25:26] that is alive to run away into the
[2:25:29] wilderness. He said is running away is a
[2:25:32] type of burial taking it completely out
[2:25:35] of memory. Hallelujah. So we have the
[2:25:38] lamb king. Amen. Christ must die as a
[2:25:41] lamb. Yes. In order to become your
[2:25:44] perfect atonement, but the blood of your
[2:25:47] cleansing must be buried.
[2:25:50] Amen. Somebody must carry it. So his
[2:25:53] death was as his barrier to carry your
[2:25:57] sin far away into the sea of God's
[2:26:00] forgetfulness. So he was your man. He
[2:26:03] was your scapegoat.
[2:26:05] That was why on the cross, Amen. the the
[2:26:08] one who knew no sin became your sin.
[2:26:12] [Music]
[2:26:16] And when it became sin, that eternal
[2:26:19] spirit, the fullness of God had to
[2:26:21] vacate that
[2:26:23] because he won't dwell in uncleanness.
[2:26:27] You were the one unclean.
[2:26:29] But he had to represent you in totality.
[2:26:33] He has to become you. Amen. So that you
[2:26:36] can become him.
[2:26:40] Hallelujah. It wasn't just a substitute.
[2:26:44] Amen. It took your place completely.
[2:26:46] Yes. He wasn't just a representation. He
[2:26:50] became the sinner you. Yes. Amen. He
[2:26:53] carried your sin completely in his body.
[2:26:57] Because he must carry it away. He said,
[2:27:00] "Behold the lamb of God that carth away
[2:27:04] the sin of the world."
[2:27:08] Wonderful. So we behold him in
[2:27:10] Gethsemane.
[2:27:12] Amen. Gethsemane was a pre-trial.
[2:27:17] Gim was the labor room. Was the labor
[2:27:20] room.
[2:27:22] Follow me now.
[2:27:24] That was the labor room.
[2:27:27] When a woman is getting due, a pregnant
[2:27:30] woman is due, the first place they take
[2:27:34] her, I think, is the labor room. Dear
[2:27:37] she labels and traveled
[2:27:40] birth pains happen. Amen. Amen. When
[2:27:44] birth pains come to climax. Yes. And
[2:27:47] she's fully dilated to release the baby.
[2:27:51] Yes. She's moved from the labor room
[2:27:53] into what? Delivery room. Amen.
[2:27:57] Gethsemane was the labor room.
[2:28:00] [Music]
[2:28:02] You know why? When Christ went to the
[2:28:05] cross
[2:28:07] He carried you and high
[2:28:09] inside of him. Let me prove that to you
[2:28:13] quickly.
[2:28:14] That you are the real celebrant of
[2:28:16] Easter. Amen. When Christ was here, he
[2:28:20] told his disciples, "Do not go in the
[2:28:23] way of the Gentiles." How many remember
[2:28:25] that? That's right.
[2:28:28] Was it because he hated the Gentiles?
[2:28:30] No. No. The Gentiles got the best
[2:28:32] package.
[2:28:35] I tell you,
[2:28:37] He called the Samaritans French. Yes. He
[2:28:40] called the Jews brethren. He called the
[2:28:43] Gentiles bright.
[2:28:48] Hallelujah. Every time Christ is
[2:28:50] afflicted by his brethren, he find
[2:28:52] comfort in the gentile. Hallelujah.
[2:28:57] When Joseph was afflicted by his
[2:28:59] brethren,
[2:29:01] his comfort was
[2:29:03] asinat.
[2:29:05] [Music]
[2:29:07] [Applause]
[2:29:16] Before his brethren knew him,
[2:29:21] already knew him.
[2:29:24] And by that knowing, she became
[2:29:26] impregnated. Yes. And gave a replica of
[2:29:29] Joseph twice.
[2:29:34] Hallelujah. Did you catch Hallelujah? So
[2:29:38] this blindness of the Jews, Amen. is
[2:29:41] very perfect. Yes. Amen. When they
[2:29:44] pushed him out, we always have it. Yes.
[2:29:47] So in the times that in this program, it
[2:29:49] was to deal with his brethren. Amen.
[2:29:52] Amen. The radical Gentiles were pushing
[2:29:55] hard
[2:29:57] to get to him. Yes.
[2:30:00] Then one day some Greeks maybe they've
[2:30:03] been coming around every once in a
[2:30:05] while. Yes. And all the deacons and the
[2:30:06] Jewish, excuse
[2:30:09] me, we don't mind about their
[2:30:11] fellowship. We want to see the pastor.
[2:30:13] You can see the
[2:30:15] pastor. But one day these Greeks were so
[2:30:18] determined.
[2:30:20] I don't know how their faces look like.
[2:30:23] But this time around when they came even
[2:30:25] the disciples knew they meant business.
[2:30:26] Yeah,
[2:30:28] they couldn't say go. No,
[2:30:32] maybe when one of them want to say go
[2:30:35] maybe want to say go and look at their
[2:30:39] faces are not smiling.
[2:30:45] Okay, what do you want sex? We will see
[2:30:49] Jesus.
[2:30:50] [Applause]
[2:30:53] Look at look at the language. They
[2:30:55] didn't say we want to.
[2:30:58] Can we please? It's a question whether
[2:31:01] you like it or not.
[2:31:05] We could sing.
[2:31:07] [Applause]
[2:31:12] So they were instant and by that they
[2:31:15] said let's escalate it. Let's escalate
[2:31:17] it. So one tell
[2:31:22] Philip tell Andrew and Andrew went and
[2:31:24] tell
[2:31:27] maybe okay and Andrew and Philip went to
[2:31:31] when Philip told Andrew he said I can't
[2:31:33] do it you are the one they saw let's go
[2:31:36] together when they came to the
[2:31:39] Lord let's hear what they say give us
[2:31:41] the first line
[2:31:44] and Jesus answered them the hour is
[2:31:48] Hey, hold it there.
[2:31:51] Andrew and Philip said, "Pastor, those
[2:31:54] Greeks, they are here again today, but
[2:31:56] this time
[2:31:58] around, we couldn't resist. You need to
[2:32:00] come talk to
[2:32:01] them." And instead of our Lord coming
[2:32:04] out to talk to them, the hour is
[2:32:09] you
[2:32:10] know, pastor, which hour they want to
[2:32:14] see. You said the hour is what? He said
[2:32:16] you don't get it. He said that the son
[2:32:20] of man
[2:32:22] should be glorified. When the Gentiles
[2:32:25] were pushing out to see Christ,
[2:32:30] there is a need. Hallelujah. For Christ
[2:32:33] to be glorified. Yes. The word in his
[2:32:37] glorification, his death, his burial,
[2:32:40] his resurrection, his ascension before
[2:32:43] ascension and his final ascension. My
[2:32:48] don't be confused. I say ascension
[2:32:49] before ascension. We can come to it.
[2:32:51] Hallelujah. You know when Jesus
[2:32:52] resurrected,
[2:32:54] amen. Some of the sisters and brother
[2:32:56] wanted to touch me. Yes. He said, "No,
[2:32:58] you can't touch me. For I have not
[2:33:00] ascended to your father and my father.
[2:33:03] to your God and my God. The prophet said
[2:33:06] he actually went.
[2:33:08] Amen. To submit the trophy.
[2:33:12] Then he came back and started appearing.
[2:33:16] I said, "Thomas, you can touch me now."
[2:33:20] So there was an ascension before his
[2:33:23] final acts chapter one ascension.
[2:33:25] Hallelujah. That's right.
[2:33:28] Those were his glorification.
[2:33:32] Uh-huh. Oh, you took it away. You
[2:33:35] advertise us with the scripture, please.
[2:33:38] [Applause]
[2:33:42] Amen. That the son of man should be
[2:33:44] glorified. Yes. The next verse, watch
[2:33:47] it. Now verily verily I say unto you,
[2:33:51] Amen. Except a con of which fall into
[2:33:55] the ground and die, it abideth alone,
[2:34:00] but if it die, it bringeth forth much
[2:34:07] in holy
[2:34:09] land. The Greeks, the Gentiles will see
[2:34:14] Jesus
[2:34:15] after his death, burial and
[2:34:19] resurrection. And this was necessary.
[2:34:21] You know why? If he did not die,
[2:34:26] Jesus and his ministry finishes.
[2:34:31] Amen. But if he dies and he resurrects,
[2:34:36] he will be able to replicate himself in
[2:34:40] many body of blood.
[2:34:46] How will he release you? How will he
[2:34:48] release me? The prophet says he went
[2:34:51] with you and I in his womb
[2:34:55] to the cross. Amen.
[2:34:58] That was why Gethsemane was his labor
[2:35:02] room.
[2:35:08] Brother said while he was in the labor
[2:35:11] room of
[2:35:13] he's got to make just one decision.
[2:35:16] And this
[2:35:17] decision is hanging.
[2:35:20] Yes. On call things. Amen. He said the
[2:35:23] sins of the past. Yes. The sins of the
[2:35:27] present. The sins of the future.
[2:35:31] Amen. Did you hear me?
[2:35:36] The sins of the past. The sins of the
[2:35:39] present. The sins of the future. Their
[2:35:42] forgiveness,
[2:35:44] their erasure,
[2:35:46] depends on that decision. Hallelujah.
[2:35:51] Amen. Because people couldn't enter into
[2:35:53] the holiest of the holies. Yes. As great
[2:35:56] as they were, when they died in the Old
[2:36:00] Testament. Yes. They couldn't go to the
[2:36:02] presence of God. Yes. They were only
[2:36:04] kept in the paradise that was. That's
[2:36:07] right. In the same prison house. Yes.
[2:36:10] But the VIP section.
[2:36:13] Because they are not common prisoners.
[2:36:15] Yes. Satan up to that time owes the keys
[2:36:19] of hell and death. Yes. That's right. No
[2:36:22] matter how righteous you were, you got
[2:36:25] under the lock and key. That's right.
[2:36:27] The devil when you die. Yes. Amen.
[2:36:31] Wonderful.
[2:36:33] Hallelujah.
[2:36:35] Satan takes death as his property and as
[2:36:38] many as were killed by his property
[2:36:41] becomes his property. Yes. But the likes
[2:36:44] of Abraham and then God said you can
[2:36:46] hold them but you can't hold them in the
[2:36:48] common prison house. That is why
[2:36:51] sections were created.
[2:36:57] And the place of torment all kind of
[2:36:59] category. Yes. Amen. But all of them
[2:37:03] under the lock and key of the devil.
[2:37:05] That's right. So if Christ never died
[2:37:08] and paid the price and resurrected, they
[2:37:10] cannot be free. Amen. Amen. Because it
[2:37:14] is the death of Christ, the payment of
[2:37:16] the sacrifice of Christ that will atone
[2:37:19] perfectly
[2:37:20] for the sins of the past. It will atone
[2:37:22] for the present and it will atone for
[2:37:25] the future. Yes, sir. There must be an
[2:37:28] advanced atonement for you and I. Amen.
[2:37:32] Not to encourage us and say, but to show
[2:37:36] us what God has done so that in all
[2:37:38] situations, Amen. we can find peace.
[2:37:43] [Music]
[2:37:44] [Applause]
[2:37:45] So when he gets he said knock by will
[2:37:48] let thy will be done.
[2:37:51] Christ became fully dilated for
[2:37:54] delivery.
[2:37:56] And from that moment he was moved from
[2:37:58] Gethsemane to Calvary the delivery room.
[2:38:02] Hallelujah.
[2:38:05] Are you still joining with me?
[2:38:07] When he came to the delivery room,
[2:38:12] the delivery turned out not to be
[2:38:13] natural.
[2:38:15] It was cesarian.
[2:38:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:38:20] So before you can come forth,
[2:38:23] Christ must be put under necessia.
[2:38:29] And it could not go under necessia until
[2:38:32] he declared it is
[2:38:34] finished. Amen. Amen.
[2:38:39] Amen. He is the one to determine when
[2:38:43] the surgeon will do his job.
[2:38:45] Amen. He is the one to determine when
[2:38:48] he's ready to bring forth. Amen.
[2:38:51] When he said it is finished,
[2:38:54] yielded her. He went into anastasia.
[2:38:58] Amen. Hallelujah. And while he was
[2:39:01] there,
[2:39:03] thank you Jesus. The devil was trying to
[2:39:07] work your deliverance.
[2:39:09] Instead, he anointed the soldiers to
[2:39:12] take a hammer.
[2:39:14] They wanted to do autoetic surgery.
[2:39:17] Very what was needed was a ceerian
[2:39:19] surgery. Amen.
[2:39:22] They carried the armor. Let me tell you,
[2:39:25] the carrying of the armor was
[2:39:26] intentional. Yes. Yes. Satan knew the
[2:39:29] word of the Lord that not one bone of
[2:39:32] his body will be broken. But he will
[2:39:35] always attempt
[2:39:37] to challenge the word thinking that that
[2:39:40] has been spoken several years ago and it
[2:39:43] must have expired. But I tell you this
[2:39:46] morning, God's word does not expire.
[2:39:50] God's word can never fail. Hold on to it
[2:39:55] as a lifeline. Abraham said when God
[2:39:58] speaks he puts a power behind it. When
[2:40:02] that word is challenged the power wakes
[2:40:04] up the God and it starts to defend
[2:40:09] only believe.
[2:40:11] All things are possible.
[2:40:15] Once they carry the hammer they broke
[2:40:18] the legs of the first
[2:40:21] because there was no promise against
[2:40:23] that. Amen.
[2:40:27] If you start from the left, Jesus was in
[2:40:30] the middle. So he should be the next,
[2:40:32] isn't it? If you start from the right,
[2:40:35] Jesus was in the middle. So it should be
[2:40:37] the next. How come they bypass Jesus?
[2:40:42] The moment he carried the hammer, the
[2:40:44] word came alive. Not one bone
[2:40:48] could be
[2:40:49] broken. Yes. Even the sleeping Jesus,
[2:40:54] the dead Jesus was more powerful than
[2:40:58] the active Satan.
[2:41:03] Hallelujah.
[2:41:05] One day was sleeping in the boat. Do you
[2:41:08] remember that? 100% man. 100% God. Amen.
[2:41:15] As a man, he was sleeping in the boat
[2:41:17] and Satan said, "There I got him."
[2:41:19] before he got up. I will sing this boat.
[2:41:22] Amen. And Satan was working hard and the
[2:41:26] sleeping Jesus was just sleeping. He
[2:41:29] slept so deep until he took the
[2:41:32] disciples to come and wake Jesus. You
[2:41:36] got to wake him Sunday
[2:41:38] because persecution is coming. Pressure
[2:41:41] is coming.
[2:41:43] Hallelujah. Is coming. You will be
[2:41:46] working one more time.
[2:41:48] Hallelujah.
[2:41:50] And they went to meet him master fear
[2:41:54] not that we perish and they will think
[2:41:56] they are sounding spiritual.
[2:41:59] It's an insult to the ability of God.
[2:42:03] Yes. To think a boat where Jesus was in
[2:42:08] whe could be sunk. It's an insult.
[2:42:14] That was when Jesus got up he never
[2:42:17] commanded them. So he must have said for
[2:42:20] you guys this is your level. I will be
[2:42:22] here and the boat will sink. I think
[2:42:25] better.
[2:42:27] Behold what manner of man is it? Then
[2:42:30] they went to the bra of the
[2:42:34] cal please be still
[2:42:37] and all the of the devil went down
[2:42:42] the sleeping Jesus more powerful than
[2:42:46] the active Satan.
[2:42:49] Now the dead Jesus
[2:42:51] is even more powerful than the living
[2:42:54] Satan.
[2:42:57] They carried me.
[2:42:59] They went for the first bypass Jesus.
[2:43:03] Came to the second. They said now with
[2:43:05] full force we shall break this one. And
[2:43:09] the Lord say you dumb. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:43:12] Drop the hammer. Yes. We are not doing
[2:43:15] traumatic automatic surgery. What we
[2:43:18] doing is a delivery.
[2:43:20] Get your tools right. Yes. Drop the
[2:43:23] hammer. Beep the spear. Yes. hit the
[2:43:27] middle point, the surgical needle.
[2:43:30] Hallelujah. And he went for the side.
[2:43:33] And for you to know, it was a delivery.
[2:43:35] Blood and water came out.
[2:43:41] And what came out
[2:43:42] after you? You except a con of wheat.
[2:43:48] One seed was killed and buried. It
[2:43:51] brings forth many. Hallelujah. Whereas
[2:43:54] it was one Jesus, from Calvary, many
[2:43:57] Jesuses came out.
[2:43:59] [Music]
[2:44:00] [Applause]
[2:44:02] Hallelujah.
[2:44:03] [Applause]
[2:44:05] And when he said, "It is finished."
[2:44:09] The veil of the temple.
[2:44:13] Yes. We're closing that rent. Amen.
[2:44:19] Intol. In other words, the veil that
[2:44:23] separated the holiest of the holies.
[2:44:27] Where the light of God Shaka glory
[2:44:29] dwells where the manner that cannot gain
[2:44:33] where the cherubims
[2:44:36] mounted God was broken loose. Yes. In
[2:44:41] other words, the path to the tree of
[2:44:44] life. Amen. The path to the fullness of
[2:44:47] the word, the spiritual food in due
[2:44:50] season, the way of eternal life, was
[2:44:54] open.
[2:44:55] The path to revelation was open.
[2:45:00] This is what did for you and I.
[2:45:04] [Applause]
[2:45:06] Hallelujah.
[2:45:09] Brother Brown said, "I can see the
[2:45:11] cherubims look at themselves."
[2:45:15] Amen. No job again.
[2:45:20] The man who told us to block has opened
[2:45:23] it inside.
[2:45:25] I can hear God respond back. New job
[2:45:28] now.
[2:45:30] [Music]
[2:45:31] New job now.
[2:45:33] New job now. Before now I told you to
[2:45:37] chase them away with that sword. Yes.
[2:45:41] But you now take that same sword.
[2:45:44] to chase them back inside.
[2:45:48] Are you with me, brother? That is why in
[2:45:51] every service the terms must be here.
[2:45:55] Brother said, "You may not see them, but
[2:45:59] you can feel their influence.
[2:46:01] What are they doing? Giving you a
[2:46:03] charge, making you say amen, making you
[2:46:07] stand up, making you rejoice, making you
[2:46:10] work to the Lord." Why? It is the sword
[2:46:13] of God bringing you back to the tree of
[2:46:17] life to enjoy every blessing that God
[2:46:21] has for you.
[2:46:27] This is the reason in this last days.
[2:46:29] Hallelujah.
[2:46:31] The last cherubim. Oh yes. Hallelujah.
[2:46:34] There were four cherubims.
[2:46:36] There were mountains guard around the
[2:46:38] throne of God. You remember that? Amen.
[2:46:41] One has got the face of a lion. Uh-huh.
[2:46:45] One has got the face
[2:46:48] of an ox. One has got the face of a man
[2:46:52] and the other the face of an eagle. And
[2:46:56] these are the four that are closest to
[2:46:58] the throne. After them comes the 24
[2:47:01] elders. After the 24 elders comes the
[2:47:04] group of John. That's what the Bible
[2:47:07] said. John as a layer. to see the
[2:47:11] throne. He has to meet the 24 elders.
[2:47:14] Then after the 24 elders, the four
[2:47:17] cherubims, they were the closest to the
[2:47:19] throne. They have eyes in front and at
[2:47:22] the back. The prophet said it shows
[2:47:24] their level of spiritual intelligence.
[2:47:27] [Applause]
[2:47:29] And these four cherubims ran through the
[2:47:32] seven church ages.
[2:47:35] Hallelujah.
[2:47:38] You will see what Easter did for you.
[2:47:41] The last of the Jerobans is the one with
[2:47:44] the face over.
[2:47:46] Amen. When this remain was to be made
[2:47:51] manifest on the earth.
[2:47:56] Sacrileg.
[2:47:57] No sir. But the truth
[2:48:01] when the path to the tree of life was to
[2:48:03] be made manifest on the earth. When the
[2:48:06] hidden man
[2:48:08] was to be brought out from under the
[2:48:10] cover of the wings of the cherub. Amen.
[2:48:14] Which is the totality of the word. Yes.
[2:48:17] Revealed. Yes. God told the last cherub.
[2:48:21] Amen. Go to the mountain. Amen.
[2:48:24] Hallelujah.
[2:48:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Anyone to
[2:48:29] the mountain
[2:48:31] shall be no
[2:48:34] not sunset now shall be no
[2:48:38] the same mountain where he saw that
[2:48:41] squirrel his enemy that afflicted him
[2:48:43] every seven years dead. Amen. Amen. The
[2:48:48] squirrel was on this side of the
[2:48:49] walkway. Then he was told to go on this
[2:48:52] other side of the walkway. Amen.
[2:48:56] right to the top of the mountain. Amen.
[2:48:59] And in there, you see this message came
[2:49:02] with the Lord of Cost to you and I. I
[2:49:05] believe God could have spoken things in
[2:49:07] the comfort of the prophets to him. But
[2:49:10] even for a 5 minute encounter, it will
[2:49:12] say leave your house, travel some
[2:49:17] and go stay on a mountain and I will
[2:49:20] come to you. Amen. If the prophet is
[2:49:22] thirsty and he needed water, do you know
[2:49:25] he has to come down about 2,000 ft off
[2:49:28] the mountain to drink water and then go
[2:49:31] back again if God has not attended to
[2:49:34] him and he just must wait there.
[2:49:38] And it's not an easy climb. My God. I've
[2:49:41] done it before twice or Yeah. twice now.
[2:49:45] Once with my wife, once alone. And the
[2:49:48] old man who was taking us up there to
[2:49:51] the mountain, he got a knapsack and
[2:49:54] packed a lot of water and Coca-Cola. And
[2:49:57] I said, "What is this man for?" Uh, I
[2:50:00] said, "Pastor, you will know as we go.
[2:50:02] Who is this?" I said, "We don't need
[2:50:04] this much." She said, "Pastor, calm
[2:50:07] down." If you have the generation book,
[2:50:10] when you open it in the middle, that's
[2:50:11] what our Peterson say. You kind see
[2:50:14] whether we did it or not. Tell you what,
[2:50:17] between me and my wife, we finish the
[2:50:19] whole lap sack before we go to the
[2:50:20] mountain.
[2:50:25] It's a desert place. When you clitude,
[2:50:28] it feels like your body's
[2:50:29] disintegrating. Everything dry. So the
[2:50:33] old man in his wisdom and me by
[2:50:35] ignorance with a fellowship.
[2:50:38] This was what our prophet went through.
[2:50:40] Yes. But I thank God was for a just
[2:50:45] [Applause]
[2:50:47] he was there praying and praying and
[2:50:50] praying just waiting upon the Lord and
[2:50:53] all of a sudden he felt something in his
[2:50:56] eyes.
[2:50:59] When he opened his eyes, what was it? It
[2:51:03] was a glistening saw.
[2:51:06] Then he heard a voice the king saw.
[2:51:10] Then he said a king sword. A king kn a
[2:51:14] man with a sword. The boys came back.
[2:51:16] Not a king. Because we are suggesting
[2:51:19] one out of many. Yes. There is only one
[2:51:22] king.
[2:51:25] Hallelujah. The king of that is the king
[2:51:29] of the king of kings himself.
[2:51:32] Hallelujah. Oh my. I was fellowshipping
[2:51:36] around that and the sword went by. Yes.
[2:51:39] But the prophet said when he had that
[2:51:42] sword, he looked like his palm was
[2:51:46] measured. Hallelujah. The hungry.
[2:51:50] That's for another.
[2:51:52] Somebody's p was measured to fit the
[2:51:55] handle. Hallelujah. Somebody receive
[2:51:57] grace to bring the perfection of
[2:52:01] understanding, the totality of
[2:52:04] revelation of the message of the hour.
[2:52:07] Hallelujah. The king's sword is the word
[2:52:09] of the Lord.
[2:52:13] Why will God night brother with the
[2:52:15] sword right around the opening of the
[2:52:18] word is to show to us on earth what
[2:52:21] happened in the book of Matthew. What
[2:52:23] happened on that day? What happened in
[2:52:26] the book of Mark that on earth the veil
[2:52:29] has truly been rented. The path to the
[2:52:32] tree of life has been made open again.
[2:52:35] So God sent his charm to do what? With
[2:52:39] the S to chase us back. This is the
[2:52:42] reason for the prophet message.
[2:52:45] He has chased us back. And that was why
[2:52:47] he brought us spiritual food induces.
[2:52:51] Are we feeding daily on those blessings?
[2:52:54] It will work upon the atoms of our body
[2:52:57] and change us from glory to glory. From
[2:53:01] who we are to who we should be. A
[2:53:04] masterpiece of God that will give you
[2:53:07] evidence that indeed Christ is not dead
[2:53:10] but is alive. The veil of the temple
[2:53:13] have been rented because he said it is
[2:53:16] finished. God bless you. Hallelujah.
[2:53:41] Thank you.
[2:53:43] Amen.
[2:53:47] That's right.
[2:53:49] Lord, for the message of the hour. Amen.
[2:53:55] Can musicians please come forward.
[2:54:00] Amen.
[2:54:02] Hallelujah. What am I doing here?
[2:54:09] Praise be to God.
[2:54:11] Can you
[2:54:13] see why Satan for the visa?
[2:54:17] Can you see why he was trying to block
[2:54:20] the visa?
[2:54:26] He was trying to block somebody's
[2:54:28] liberty.
[2:54:30] Because the message we heard today is a
[2:54:32] message of ley.
[2:54:35] a message of resurrection.
[2:54:39] God bless you my precious pastor. May
[2:54:42] strengthen you for the rest of the
[2:54:44] service. Hallelujah.
[2:54:46] Praise be to God. I pray brother and
[2:54:48] sister that
[2:54:50] today will be the a new beginning for
[2:54:53] many of you.
[2:54:55] Those who are weak, those who are
[2:54:57] struggling, those who who feel defeated,
[2:55:01] may the word strengthen you.
[2:55:05] May the Lord strengthen himself. Listen
[2:55:08] to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:55:11] We're going to pray for a couple of
[2:55:13] hours and then we're going to come back
[2:55:15] to this afternoon service at
[2:55:17] 4:00. Amen. If some of you are not
[2:55:20] coming back this afternoon, please come
[2:55:22] back. We all need each other. We need
[2:55:24] your heat. We need your Amen. You need
[2:55:28] the word of God. If you are deciding to
[2:55:31] go home, maybe there's nothing to do at
[2:55:33] home. You just want to go home. No, just
[2:55:35] don't go home. Just come back to the
[2:55:38] sir. What's more important than the
[2:55:41] world? Brother
[2:55:42] Adrian, more important than the
[2:55:45] world. Let's sing a chorus before our
[2:55:47] precious Pastor Bright. Pastor Bright,

[2:55:52] "Amen." Where is Pastor
