May we please bow our heads for a word of prayer. Gracious Almighty God, we thank you this morning for another privilege to be back in thy house. Yes, Lord. Our soul can rejoice this morning. Yes. Because we are feeling the victorious vibration of heaven. Yes, Lord. That the battle is over. Yes, Jesus. And we are thankful for the great and mighty conqueror who defeated Satan. Yes. Defeated sin. Yes. He defeated death. Yes. He defth every temptation and every powers of hell. The sin shall by no means have power over us again. Because when he received the victory, he gave us the trophy. Amen. And by this we are more than conqueror. Thank you dear father for what you did for us. Our soul will never forget that because of this we have brought appreciation this morning by way of praise and thanksgiving. Father may you accept our worship. May you accept our praises. May you accept all our offerings. May you also accept our person. And nothing God will stand between our soul and our savior. Nothing will hide your face from us. Come by one more time and bring the bread of life unto us. expand it unto us, Lord, like you did on the road by us. That our eyes of understanding will be illuminated and we shall become lightfooted by the revealed world having the cares and the bodies of life rolled away. We shall become lightfooted to go the whole stretch of a journey to declare that you are indeed alive to give the evidence of your resurrection. Let our heart come within us one more time to take in the service. Lord, every need that will be represented or are represented in your house this morning. Father, I pray that you will minister grace. You will minister provision move through the audience of your people, but please don't pass no post of each person. May you discern their needs, oh God, and grant to them the substance of their requests and their desires. Fulfill their joy. Settle them. Make them happy and take glory, oh God, and give them a testimony. Be with us through this service, Lord, both morning and evening. And bless all the saints wherever they are gathered today. Let it not be a time of ritual observance. Let it be a time of freshness of an encounter with you that indeed we all can say from that time. Bless your servants. Bless the audience. Take over the atmosphere. I think the environment will be charged by your power. Thank you for the song service. Thank you for the song leaders, the musicians. Thank you for your children who ministered to us by way of special numbers and all that have been rendered in your presence. Oh God, may you cap it up, oh God, with the blessings of your word. And we'll be careful to return thanksgiving when all shall be over today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. [Applause] The Lord bless you saints. I wish you happy Easter. come to somebody and wish them happy Easter and we pray that the hero of God who rise on a day like this will give a quick name to honor the winters of life had frozen in our lives in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Uh if you have your Bibles with you so that I don't keep you standing, let's turn our Bibles to the book of Amos this morning. The book of Amos chapter 4. Amos chapter 4. I just want to read a verse. Verse 12. Amos 4:12. If you are there, say amen. Amen. Amen. Okay. Therefore, thus will I do unto thee, O Israel. And because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy word. God bless you. You may be seated. Once again, I would like to thank the pastors for the privilege uh given unto me to come and be of service to the people of God. And uh I sincerely hope somewhere the service can be of a blessing. Amen. Amen. And uh I appreciate every one of you for coming uh to the service. Your coming is an encouragement to the preacher because when the preacher comes to town like I said in the first service, our expectation is not to come and speak to cheers and to benches because the gospel is not meant for cheers. The gospel is meant for human beings. Amen. So if the Lord give us people to speak to, it's such a privilege. That's right. And we will not take that for granted. Amen. We will do all we can to be of service. And then when the Lord bless it, it becomes a blessing. So thank you for coming. And uh it's such an encouragement. The Lord bless everyone of you. The sacrifices you are making to sit under the elements like this. I can see a lot of you already finding yourself. Yeah. The Lord will the Lord will give you a certain time in his presence. Amen. The prophet said the reason we endure this heat is because we want to escape a greater heat. So the Lord bless you as you make the sacrifice. And uh he also told us that the things that God bless most are sac are services that come with form of for sacrifice or the other. So when you endure the elements like that and you travel the far you have come and all those things I believe God uh is going to bless you. So God bless you. You are welcome this morning. If the Lord will be our help, which he has always been, I would like to speak on preparing to meet the coming king. Amen. Amen. The coming king rose up on a day like this. Amen. And uh in the book of Acts chapter 1, like I said the other day, when he was ascending, in his final ascension, two angels came back to give comfort to those who are gazing. He said, "Why stand ye gazing?" This same Jesus as he went, he will return like a man. Amen. Amen. And uh I told you yesterday that he has started returning [Music] because we are not uh like the world who wait for rapture in the manner they wait for rapture. Amen. To us rapture is a process. And we already process. Amen. Amen. The Lord would suddenly descend with a shout. That's the promise. And we have the shout. Amen. And we understood that the shout wasn't the the first and the second pool. It was the third the reveal word that has brought in the bride of Christ. The first and the second pool brought all kind of congregation all manner of people because it was an attracting pool. Amen. But when you attracted you attracted for the purpose of being told something. Amen. So behind every sign there must be a voice. So the sign could gather everybody but the voice will separate those for whom it is meant among the crowd that is gathered. So that voice that is separating is a shout. Amen. And we said if you miss a shout in your day, you are not going to get the voice if you leave before he comes because he set the dead in Christ and Christ is the reveal word. Amen. The message of the hour. Hallelujah. That was why when those seven angels formed up there amen. Even the prophet didn't uh understand or understood the import of the picture, the photo he was holding until he was explaining all the circumstances around it in the church. And the spirit of the Lord said, "Turn it this way." Brother Brown said, "Only the Lord knows the right angle." And he turned it the way he was told to turn. And by the time he did, there was a visible face of Christ. And brother Graham said, "Oh, it was our Lord all of them." Hallelujah. So our Lord has started his descension, but ascending is a present continuous. So meaning he has not fully arrived but he's here with us. And brother Graham said the the fullness of his arrival will be his corporal body becoming visible. His feet will not touch this ground. Amen. But there will be a full appearance and he appears like a great magnet to magnetize those who have similar material. The only people that have similar material with him are those upon whom the shout has walked. He has worked upon the atoms of their bodies. He has questioned them in his likeness. So become of the same material. Word of his word, life of his life, power of his power. She is him. [Applause] Glory to God. So where are the we are those angels of the keeper told our sisters who came early morning today and uh they said who are you looking for? He said they are looking for Jesus of Nazareth. He said, "How can you be looking for the living among the dead? He is risen as a hallelujah. He is not here." So, but today we can say she is risen. She's not living among the dead again. She's no longer in the economy of this year. A dead ground. Hallelujah. That was what we tried to show you yesterday. That resurrection and rapture has its location. Amen. Amen. And I hope I prove it to you by the scripture. There was no resurrection. There was no rapture in Egypt. It all took place in Jerusalem. So because God has always localized that and there's a local spot where it will take place again today, not in La this year, but in the h of the bride. the economy of the reveal world. So if you are not him, come inside. You are cordially invited. Very cordly invited. Let's serve be the name of the Lord. Now in the message the prepare preparation uh 53-11 1111 paragraph uh 15 if they want to put it there. Uh the prophet was saying what I want to do tonight uh by God's help if you will help me is to speak his words to you that will prepare your heart for the evening service. Yes. He was using that message as a message of preparation for evening service. Amen. Uh there are messages that are targeted for certain things. Yes. Amen. Sometimes we want to have a healing service, there's a way we'll bring the message. Even Sunday morning messages, sometimes because we usually have mixed audience, there's a way we bring the message so that everybody can get something. Amen. That is just what he's saying. Amen. He said, but before God does anything, he always prepares for it. It is man that is always not prepared for the consequences of his action. But before God does anything, he anticipates all that the challenges that will come along the way. He looks at the end from the beginning. Then he gets himself ready. Yes. When man speaks, sometimes man is brought to take his word back because he speaks with the best of intention but with the best of knowledge of what he knew at that moment. Amen. But because he's a creator that learns every day. Amen. The moment he knows better, Amen. He will come back and say what I spoke yesterday needs correction or needs editing. Don't blame him. That is just man but that is what makes God different. Amen. When God speaks he cannot take it back because he speaks with the knowledge of the end right from the beginning. And sometimes man speaks without even thinking. Amen. True. And he's prone to take back his words. Amen. But that is not God. God cannot take back his words. So man is always not prepared for the consequences of his speech or the consequences of his action. If you look at Adam in in the beginning, when Adam fell, he wasn't prepared for the consequence of his falling. That was when the presence of the Lord came down. Adam couldn't wait for God. Whereas before then he was like the resident pastor on earth and God the invited or the big pastor. Amen. It makes everything ready for God to come and take over. But this particular day he wasn't in service. Even the congregation was not in service. God came. He waited all through the waiting period. He met nobody and he had to be looking for his congregation. Adam where and thou. Amen. When Adam realized that there was a problem, he invented an idea. He must have given comfort to all his members from the woman to all the creation said don't worry I I'll take care of it. Amen. That the Bible said he sold fig leaves and covered himself, covered the woman. But by the time the presence of God arrived, he found himself so inadequate and God had to be looking for him. So Adam wasn't prepared and man is always not prepared. Amen. That is why King David said, "Blessed is the man whom thou chooses." Amen. and cause it to approach unto thee. God must choose you and give you the ability to approach unto God. Amen. Because man is never prepared. Amen. Amen. But the God we serve is the God of preparation. Hallelujah. Amen. The prophet said God does not do anything. Before he does a thing, he weighs it. Amen. And I think he wanted us to have such principles. Yes sir. That was why when he came in flesh he was telling you he said if you want to go to battle count the cost. Amen. If you want to build a house comes the cost. Amen. He said in building the house, if you don't count the cost and you just jump at it, you may end up creating a white elephant project, something that will never be finished and you become a tool of mockery. He said if you know if you want to go to a battle, he said prepare. And then if you know you don't have what it takes to confront the enemy, he said seek condition of peace. Amen. Those things were taught by the flesh. When you seek condition of peace, it doesn't make you a weakling, but it reveals that you're a person with wisdom. Hallelujah. That's right. Wonderful. And that is part of the preparation that you must have. Amen. So it said before we go to fight a war, he said before God does anything, he always prepares for it. Before we go to fight a war, first we have to prepare for that war. Amen. Amen. If you are going to get married, why you prepare for that time? The prophet is showing that everything in life needs a preparation. Amen. In the message choosing of a bride, he said you think, you plan, you pray and you pray true. When you are trying to make a choice of a woman, you have not even chosen. See the preparation level. He say you think, you pray, you plan and you break through. In making a choice. Amen. And you have to even think beyond marriage. Amen. Because apart from the spiritual requirements, there's also a psychological preparation. Amen. You say, "What are you saying?" I'm saying it from the spoken word. Amen. In the message running from the presence of the Lord, the prophet said, "We are always, it's always prone men to want to dodge responsibility." He said, "But parent is also a responsibility and you must prepare for it." Amen. Some of you like your wall sleek and beautiful, nice, white and fine. You must realize that God is going to bring some little little beautiful things. They call them wonderful creatures. You love to have them. When you don't have them, your chemistry is reversed. They are doing prayer requests for you night and day. But when they come, they come with their responsibilities. Yeah, they are going to look at your beautiful white walls and they are going to put their hand in some reddish thing one day and say if I could p the wall for my daddy the wall will look much more beautiful and they going to do it but you are going to look at it as something destroying and you must be careful not to beat or shout on them anyhow lest their guardian angel be annoyed with you. Hallelujah. That's right. Amen. Amen. That is your psychological preparation. So in everything he said you prepare for that time. Amen. You prepare for leadership. You prepare to be a servant of the Lord. Even when God calls you and the call to you has been witnessed. Amen. That you have the call of God in your life, you still prepare for it. Amen. You know why? Because behind every call is a timing. There is a how. There is a where. And there is a when. Those things must be certain to you. Otherwise, you will make a failure. Before you come to church, you also make preparations. Amen. What were what are your expectations when you are coming? The prophet said we must come with expectation. No matter how weak your expectation is, you must hold it very tight because you know why expectation is powered by faith. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Even when your expectation is skewed, don't worry. God will arrange it. We have an advocate. But still have an expectation. Hallelujah. You remember the guy at the gate beautiful, the lady guy? Amen. His expectation was just to have few rents to take care of himself. Amen. He wasn't expecting a permanent solution. He wanted temporary relief. But because he was expecting anyhow. Amen. It is not what you expecting that God honors us all as the faith behind that expectation. When you have that faith that it is possible, hallelujah, something can take place. I hope you came with some today. So you can feel the virtue of God. Amen. All right. It said the ambulance to bring you maybe the sick ones or your loved ones to bring you. You had to get a certain amount of money ready before you could come. It's all preparation. And God always prepares the people for the events that's just about to happen. And church, I want you to know that there are events that are just about to happen. Amen. When we talk about the coming of the Lord, like I said, we don't expect the coming of the Lord like the world is expected. Amen. Before the Lord comes, the this earth, this world itself must come to a condition that makes the coming necessary. The kingdom of God cannot be established until the kingdom of the world collapses. There must be a collapse of a kingdom. to give way to another kingdom. There must be a collapse of the human structure to give way to a structure that is in collapsible. That is why the prophet said if you see a tree struggling to survive is to tell you that somewhere trees don't struggle. All right, let's go on a little bit more. He said, "May I stop right here just a minute and say I believe that the people are in the preparation of the last great destruction this world will ever know." I believe we are at the end. Amen. You can speak to people. You could put a Billy Graham in every city in the United States. They will drink whiskey and smoke cigarettes and laugh at you and everything else just the same. Amen. The gospel is meaning nothing to them. Amen. They are in the spirit of the last days. Now watch this. And God cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit for destruction. [Music] God never did destroy anything. Man always destroys himself. Yes sir. All these things must happen to invite the physical coming of the Lord. The world must be in a mode for destruction. Amen. The people must be in the spirit to be destroyed because it is man that will actually destroy himself in the judgment of the earth. God will be just. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So everything you are saying the moral bank bankruptcy the sodomy and whatever is happening it's putting the world in the mode for destruction conviction will be leaving the Gentiles and that conviction will be going back to the Jews. Amen. You know God does not deal with the Gentiles and the Jews at the same time. Amen. One must give way for the other. Amen. Blindness went to them in part so that we can have an opportunity. But I want to tell the church this morning that our opportunity is gradually fading [Music] whether we like it or not. There will be an intervention soon. Very soon. How close we are, I don't know. But I know it is so close. And that is why conviction is leaving the Gentiles. They did a study. They did an observation study 2, three years ago, maybe getting to third year now. And they were saying uh you know they were trying to study what in what interest gentile young people more on the internet in such and they realize that there are things that promote morality such as pornography and all kind of vain things. But then they look beam their satellites to Israel and they realize that the young people are more interested in the idea of the coming Messiah. It's all over. Amen. So conviction is leaving the Gentiles and conviction is going back to the Jews. The gospel is has turned its full cycle and is returning back to where it originally came from. Amen. The days of redemption are here. Amen. Praise the Lord. That is why if you watch closely today, just this last month or January, uh tensions begin to rise again in Israel. Amen. Amen. Because the the these animals, the red ifas they were keeping uh that that they raised in Texas and now keeping in Israel about five of them has met perfectly every Bible specification of being red ephers. You understand? Because they are now 3 years old and all the features that qualify them as a red eer for sacrifice. Hallelujah. Has been met. Now today the Zionists are saying that they are taking that as a sign that their Messiah is ready to come. And before Messiah arrives, there must be a restoration of temple worship. And what is giving them the confidence that they are now ready to go back to the temple worship is the fact that what they need to cleanse the uh the vessels of the temple and its worshipper is ready because the red eers are animals that will be killed and burns and the ashes of the red eer will be used to clean all the vessels of the temple and also used to clean sprinkle on the worshippers. to prepare them for their temple worship. Now that is good. Hear me. That is good. If for nothing else that is giving an Israel a revival that they about receiving their desire. The Messiah is not coming to restore the whole sacrifice. Amen. The Messiah is not coming to uh restore the whole sacrifice of lambs and so forth. Amen. He's not coming to do that. The two messengers that are coming, they are coming to preach this same message of the hour. [Applause] Are you with me? To bring Israel back to the genuine atonement. Hallelujah. But that is good enough to call their attention and prepare them for that. Brother said, you know why the tension is rising is because if they are going to reestablish and restore their temple worship as they desire, there is one problem. And what is the problem? The problem is that there is something standing right on the spot where that temple worship will begin. Amen. And the scripture call it abomination that stands in the holy place. That's what the prophet said, right? And Israel said they are not going to take a compromise or a negotiation. They want the spot back because historically that was where the temple stood right from the time of Solomon till the time of Jesus Christ. And it should be their joy to have the temple back again on that spot. But for the temple to stand, there must be a destruction. Amen. That means there must be a destruction of that mosque of Oman and the mosque of Omah is the third holiest site for Islam all over the world. So Islam is warming up for tension. Israel is warming up for tension. The world is warming up for tension and Israel believe they will build it. Israel believe they will collapse them most. He said because their walls and temples have always been built at troubles time. They've always carried their bridge and water with one hand and weapon with another ready to do it one more time. [Applause] Now these things are going on brethren. Do you know why we should talk about them? Amen. Because the prophet said God never gave us a clock to watch for his coming but he gave us a time piece and he call it Israel among many other evening shadow signs that are happening in our day. These are the things to point to us that one of these days [Music] that same love whom we are expecting will return. And we see it playing right in our eyes. Amen. America then elected a president. They call him Mr. Trump. And Mr. Trump sent his own before he came into power, he sent his own uh defense secretary designate to where to Israel. And when he got there, M the defense secretary begin to appreciate like a spiritual man. He began to appreciate and celebrate the coming to full maturity of the ready. They all on the net. And he said, well, we are expecting another miracle. He said, Israel had been associated with great miracles. Amen. He said 1946 to 1948 was a miracle. Amen. He said 196 that was when Israel was declared as a nation. He said 1967 6 day war was a miracle. Amen. He said another miracle happened under President Trump when he declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel. He said but we want more more miracle and it will be the miracle of the temple standing again. And he said this new government of America will give every support that is necessary to make it happen. These were men that were not Christians in the sense that you are Christians, but don't forget they will be used as tools to bring to pass the words of God. And scripturally speaking, they are servants of God because was a servant of God. Even God called Nebuchadnezzar my servant because he had an appointment. He had a service to do for the Lord. That's right. And these things are happening before our eyes. Men, great men are speaking and support is being given to the concept of the temple. Amen. Whether the temple will stand or not is not our business. But what our business is is that this thing is showing to us that if Israel is ready to receive the Messiah, then we are ready to live here. [Music] Hallelujah. Do you know humanly speaking they've put a timeline to when their temple structure will begin. September, October this year is what they call it. They've put a timeline. Now the intriguing thing for you and I is that the prophet says the temple he said that mo of a man will stand till Jesus return. Amen. Is that right? Meaning that the temple and whatever they are going to do will be within the last bracket of the end of the 70 weeks of Daniel. Amen. Where the earth the gentile earth will go into the tribulation and where the gentile bride will will have gone in the for. [Music] So could there be a possibility that this year we terminate offerings? I am not saying it will but when you see those things that are happening is a wake up call for the bride of Jesus Christ that our day of redemption is actually here Israel prepared to meet thy [Music] the prophet said three things will happened after the opening of the seven seals. He said one the world will be in the sodom condition. I hope you remember that. He said two James and Jimus will arise. He said and three the son of man will be revealed. [Music] Amen. Amen. And the prophet says, "There you have it again, your believer, your makebeliever and your unbeliever." Now, so don't look for all these folks outside. Look for them within the range of the message. Hallelujah. Because when the prophet was preaching the three kinds of believer, Yes. He said, "Even right in my church right now, I'm speaking to the three categories. It will be our desire that everybody is a believer. But don't forget light attracts all things because no life can thrive without light. There are be and jambers to discredit the message of the exodus. That's right. There will be the word going into their moral decay. And there will be a believer. Hallelujah. That is present towards their inheritance. [Applause] And these three things are already happening. Because the opening of the seals release all these spirits. Since the light of God for the hour, it must attract every character in order to bring them to maturity. So the things that are happening around is not the problem. The clock is ticking right. Amen. Amen. But you must watch the side you belong. Who is on the Lord's side this morning? Hallelujah. Do not forget that James and Jim were actually Egyptians. Amen. But why were they attributed into the Exodus? They never left Egypt. They never came out of Egypt. But I tell you one thing, their effect moved out of Egypt. The prophet said they represents the generation that withstands the message of the Exodus. Yes, sir. Amen. Death and Coran and Haban walked by the spirit of James and James. And that was why throughout that journey they were in liability. There are characters that are liabilities. And what are they to do? They are to destroy the effect the influence of the Exodus message in the life of those who will not make it. James and James left Egypt. They crossed the Red Sea. They parttook in the mana. They drank water from the rock. Hallelujah. But as they progress in that journey, being politically minded or cannally minded, never spiritual, they could not bring themselves to accept the wholesomeness of the message. Yeah. Amen. When you see characters that are appealing to other books and not the spoken word books, I'm saying what I'm saying with a sense of responsibility. I'm building a platform and not the spoken word books. They are not preparing you for your inheritance. Hallelujah. You will perish in the wilderness. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Amen. You know why? There is going to come to a junction. Unfortunately for Dayton, Coran and Abber, they came to a junction. Whether they believe that message or not, they were tried by that message. Yes. Whether you believe the message or not, your judgment as far as this age is concerned. Oh, let me make it very clear is the message of the hour. Paul said people will realize and be judged by the message of my day. The message that he preached, we received the person in the m of Paul, in the m of Moses, people to whom the what age came unto your skepticism notwithstanding. You will be judged by this message. [Music] Kora, Nathan, and they came and said, Moses, you take too much to yourself. Amen. Amen. If you think you are holy, the congregation is holier. When they preach that to you, they just trying to buy you. Amen. You will never live higher than this message. Take it from me. But prophet said, you won't live higher than your pastor teaches. True. [Music] Oh man, that's true. So you will be confined to the level of his teaching. Amen. Not to talk of the message, the anointing for a generation, for a dispensation. You will never know better than this. Are you listening to me? When we say making more sense to it is not to take you out of the message. Is to bring the unfolding blessings that are in the message. God already corrected the prophet. There is nothing outside of the scriptures. Amen. He said what you call backside are the hidden truths that are in the scriptures and all those hidden truths have been brought they became a revelation to the bride. Amen. Though it has been revealed it must still be personally revealed to you. When when we can bring you with a grace to make you see what God has done that is you having more. Amen. That's right. So no preacher will make your reputation greater than the prophet. As far as this message is concerned, you are a time waster. [Applause] So coralant look the congregation. If you are holy, the congregation is holy. You take too much to yourselves. And you know where they took it from. Yeah. Sometimes people look at physical evidences that you can cause strong facts and they use it to build false thoughts. I'll tell you now when God, you know, wanted to make choices, he made Moses the prophet messenger. Then he made his own blood brother, the high priest. And the children of his blood brother, the continual priest. Amen. But they were not the only Levites. Amen. The Levite, you know, functions are divided into three. Those who bring the message, those who take care of music, and the priest who offers the sacrifices on behalf of the people. Now Dayton, Quran and Amir began to have an idea that this priesthood aspect is the is the most how do I put it is the richest is the most lucrative aspect of the Levitical ministry. And there are thoughts that that should go around. So why will God say Moses be the messenger and his brother be the priest? Are you seeing how can minded you can be? Yes. The sovereign God does what he wants. Amen. And they couldn't buy that aspect of the message. So Dean, Koram and Abber were those who believe the message. They have the ones they want and they reject the ones they don't want. So there is nothing new under the sun. If you yourself today, you are picking I agree with this one. I don't agree with this one. You have your family intact. You have your family life. The bride will be made with the totality of the word. The bride believes the word without question. Hallelujah. Can you hear me? Brother said, "What brings perfection to the seed of Abraham is a complete revelation of God." Amen. So don't glory in your skepticism. Amen. This thing came to climax for Kora, Nathan, and Abira. And they asked to challenge that openly. It's in your Bible. Numbers chapter 16. But Moses knew God spoke to him. Moses knew God gave him that message. So you know what he did? He said, "Well, this is what the Lord gave me." He said, "No, God can't give you salt." He said, "Then let God prove himself. You go do contrary to that message." Moses fought nobody. He only told them if you are convinced of your action, do contrary to that message. And I tell you, Dan, Coral and Abraham were both they did contrary to that message. The Bible said they went to carry incense. In sensor, Jan, Quran and Abber were not from the line of error. They were the ministers to the congregation. Moses warned them. He said, "The Lord has given you the right of preaching. You handle the word. You were even more eloquent than me." When they Quran and Abraham are preaching, Moses cannot stand them. Moses sound like a boring preacher. You know why? because it's before you finish a sentence maybe the congregation is sleeping or when Quran and takes the word and connect it from Genesis to revelation the church is jumping that is why the Bible said they are men of renown and that was why their influence was so strong to sway the people but that wasn't enough for them the Bible said they indeed actually carry sensor and put incense and came into the holy place and started waving it. My when they were waving it, God started pushing them. You know what? The smokes of their offering was rising up. Go and read your Bible. Amen. So to them that was a vindication. So they must have been telling Moses, "Look at yourself. see what is happening. But Moses knew the ground he was standing. He waited till they finish their drama. When they finish all their offerings, the only thing Moses said was, "Who is on the Lord's side?" And everybody was saying, "Amen. Push him. Push him." Uh and Quran and Abraham when they looked at the countenance of Moses, they told themselves, "Anytime pastor faces like this, something must happen." Amen. So you know what I will do for now? I will be on the Lord's side. If there's no problem, I will come back to your side, brother. Bro, for now, you were alone on this matter. Yes, sir. And those who on the Lord's side came to the side of Moses. Moses recommended to God the death he wanted Kora, Amir, and Dan to die. Read your Bible. He said if these men die the death of natural human beings then God has not called them. But if it shall be that the ground will open up and swallow them and all that they have then it will be established to them that nobody that is not of the stock of Aram has the right to carry sensor and offer in the presence of the Lord. And it happened exactly as Moses requested. Hallelujah. But watch this. After the event, Moses told them, you see the sensors that they use, go and take them and put them in the holy place. Moses said, because they are allowed. Meaning that whatever they offer actually went up. But where were the people who offered they were gone. That is why your vindication will be to understand that I am in the word of God. Amen. Don't even take results for vindication. The bride is rising out of that race. If you say results, there are many people who are not believers and will tell you we are having results. And they can give you evidences of results. But let your own vindication be that you are in the word. Hallelujah. [Applause] Why were those people there? To overthrow the faith of many and prevent them from coming into their inheritance. All these things will happen in our preparation. M and the prophet said if you were expecting the rapture when you hear him preach the message rapture he dealt with scoffers. Uh-huh. If you are familiar with that spoken word book without someone he dealt with scoffers a longer time before talking about the rapture because those are the things that will confront you on your road to meeting the king. He said Peter said that day of the Lord will not come until scoffers arise fresh. Amen. And he said these coffers are following the inspiration of that Kora and Habira to do what? To discredit the message of the Exodus. Amen. And he said, "One of the first things they did was to tell us that Israel did not actually pass through the Red Sea." Is a theory today. Amen. That they only pass through a bunch of re and when they started preaching it, some people started believing it. Amen. That was discrediting the article of redemption in the first Exodus. Amen. If you take the crossing of the Red Sea out of that Exodus, that Exodus made no sense because the prophet told us in the message, redemption by blood, redemption by power, redemption in completeness, three messages. He said redemption has two parts. Amen. The redemption part one is to save you by blood. Then is to redeem you by power. Then he said, "If he can save your soul, he can heal your body." And when you begin to enjoy these two aspects of redemption, redemption is coming to you in completeness. Hallelujah. God allowing them to go through the Red Sea is to offer Israel an opportunity to enjoy redemption by power. But people are coming today to say that there was nothing like that. and people are believing them. So that Exodus, first Exodus redemption was discredited. In the second exodus, they started preaching that Jesus was not actually virgin born. That it was a ruse. The prophet said the days it was first preached 500 ministers denounced their believer of virgin birth. And do you know from that many theories have been built that Jesus was is again was again that Jesus actually got married to Mary Magdalene and some people are doing excavations today to even tell you of the graves of Christ his wife and four children. Why are you not believing that? Do you have an evidence contrary to that? Because Jesus was vindicated. Are you with me? What was the devil doing? Discrediting the article of redemption in the second exodus. Are you going with me? Now you don't take offense. Now you are enjoying this. When I come to the third exodus, please enjoy it also because we on our journey to meet our king and we must not be ignorance of the devices of the evil one. If you take the virgin birth out of the second exodus, we are wasting our time here. It shows the blood we are claiming today as the blood of our redemption is a fake. It shows we have been deceived all along. But I tell you why is Easter? Because it was the blood of God. Hallelujah. That saved you and her. Jesus was not a human. Neither was he a and Jesus was not the egg of Mary. For a woman to release drop for fertilization, there must be a sensation and sensations comes by touch. If you call it Mary's egg, you are saying God had affair with Mary is not possible. The conception of Christ came from heaven. Hallelujah. It was like an IVF conception. Hallelujah. The egg and the jam was all was all conceived by God. And God looked for a surrogate mother. Hallelujah. Mary was actually a surrogate mother. A surrogate mother is a woman whose womb was borrowed for incubation of already conceived creatures. Amen. To help carry the baby to town. She had no contribution into the conception. That was who Mary was. And that was why it was difficult for our Lord to admit Mary as his mother. [Applause] Hallelujah. If that is not the case, we are wasting our time here. There is actually no, it's a ruse. But I thank God that is the case. Then James and Chambers moved into this exodus. Hallelujah. The third exodus. I hope you realize we're in another exodus. But this is the final one. That will bring the coming of the Lord. The first Exodus, God was calling a nation out of a nation. The second one he was bringing the church out of religion and this third one is bringing his bride out of the church. In this third one also. Amen. James and James came back to do what? To discredit this exodus. And by that they are telling us that seven angels never actually came down. Is that the ring of mystery? was just a smoke of an airplane. Quite blasphemous, isn't it? For some people are believing the theory today. Amen. And God has anticipated their thoughts when he spoke through the prophet and said that it was confirmed that no clue was in that ridge at the time of this event. Amen. Amen. When the smoke is emitted, even if it's emitted by by by a pipe that goes up, right, and is coming out, where does the smoke go? It comes down and evaporate. But this smoke went up and refused to evaporate and it stood there for how many minutes or hours and formed such a thick cloud. Amen. Are you seeing how senseless your theory is? What you call a smoke, even the National Space of America called a supernatural phenomenon. The bride does not even need to fight. Amen. It is the word of science against the unbelievers. Hallelujah. They call it a supernatural phenomenon that is hard for them to bring an understanding. Amen. Amen. And guess what? In the year this thing happened, plane don't fly that high. That's right. Go do yourself. Go do your research. God will always be ahead of the devil anytime. Planes fly as high as 40,000 44,000 45,000 ft today. By technology advancement they can actually go to 80,000 ft. But they run the risk of crash of loss of wealth and many things. So by rule of law they confine them to 45,000 ft maximum. But I called you to check they don't do more than 18,000 ft. They were low flyings there. Are you still with me? But let's see what happened. 30 m wide and 26 m wide. Okay. 26 m high and 30 m wide across. Is that right? When you calculate 26 miles high, it's over 120,000 ft. So that platform at an altitude where planes still don't fly to today. So you are going to tell me the smoke that rose as much as 80,000 ft to settle how dull can human beings be and the scriptural since you are not ready to retain God in your knowledge the Bible said God will give them over to a reprobate man to believe what a lie and be damned by If you take that out of the third Exodus, redemption doesn't make sense because that was where the prophet got the commission to open the seals. The shout message that prepares you for the rapture. As a matter of fact, the first stage of the rapture. Amen. So if you deny there's no rapture to the believer and if there's no rapture, no resurrection to the saints who have gone home because this was our message of preparedness. Before the commission, what we had was signed in the end, an ability to tell the secret of the earth which gathered all kinds of people. But from among those crowds, the elect must be picked out. The only thing that can pick the elect out is the open words, the revealed word. That is the only thing that took you out of love this year and has brought you into the economy where rapture is possible. [Applause] [Music] So on your road to meeting the coming king, scoffers must rise. [Music] But a predestinated bride is determined. Nothing will take your attention than the word of the Lord. We are the Elijah group. No matter the destruction, we are looking. There is a great blessing in keeping your eyes on the promise. Did you hear me? Don't allow anything to turn your attention away from the promise. Our Lord will return to this earth. For who? For those who are looking forward to his appearance. The Bible said unto them he shall appear. One more time. [Applause] The schools of the prophet will be there. Amen. Who by the feel of the moment will have an idea that something should be taking place but don't stay in their camp. Cross over Jordan. Hallelujah. Because Canaan bear land is after Jordan. Cross over Jordan. Don't settle for this. After you cross, there's one more requirement. Looking requirement. Did you hear me? Looking requirements. Elijah asked Elisha, "You've been faithful this far." All right. Now he call that. You've been faithful this far. What do you want me to do for you? Elijah didn't mean words. He had followed long enough. Amen. To know what it takes to meet the challenge of the hour. Amen. He said I want double portion. He said that power that said by my word there will be no rain. There will be no due until I call for it. I want two of that power. Say ah. He said yes sir that's what I want. You ask me. You gave me a blanket. You've never limited me. You say I should ask what I want. Can you ask for big things? And you see before Elijah himself could get into such a mode he was prepared. Amen. You saw his picture appeared in first kings chapter 17 as if that was where his story began. No sir. The prophet came back to tell us that for a man to say by my word. Remember he was not praying. Oh God let there be no rain. He said, "By my word." And he didn't even say God saved the Lord. Did you realize that? He said by my own word. I like it when the Bible describe it like this. He said those who in the days of their prophecy have the power. They don't even ask God for the power. They don't say God do on my behalf. They have the power to shut the heavens that it rain not a church is going to have the power. Hallelujah. Brother Brown said for Elijah to be able to say that it shows that he has been somewhere. Amen. He has lived so long in the presence of God until the messenger has become his own messenger. Glory. Hallelujah. He doesn't have to quote again. He is the messenger. He said by my word. Isn't that the reason we are sitting here? To lay in the presence of the soul. Oh my take out all our cleavage or to become my wash and become the bread of life on God's table. Amen. This is why we are here friends. Hallelujah. This is what the word is doing to us. Amen. And I tell you, let me tell you, every time you come into service, you are packing virtues. You just don't realize it. You are actually never the same. You cannot stay under this pure review world. You cannot say amen to it. You cannot accept it and not have a change. Even if it's a plane of change, but there is something already taking place in your life. This is not the voice of the man. It is the message of the house. It is the word of God. It is the man of glory. You cannot stay under it. [Music] You said, "Pastor, I don't realize I'm having a dream." You wait for it. You wait for it. You think you know yourself. You don't know yourself here. I say you don't know yourself. You don't know what is in you. You don't know what you are. But one of these days, something is going to promote. As you wait for the coming of the Lord, there is going to be an opportunity to display who you are. Don't worry. Don't worry. God knows what is going. Let me give you an example. Sometimes the Lord who knoweth your friend, who knoweth who you are, will throw certain challenges in your way. And you will tell yourself, I cannot handle this. Amen. But do you know the scripture said part of God's faithfulness, faithful characteristics, is that they cannot give you a temptation or a challenge upon what you can bear. Now the thing that came your way look too much for you. But the one who allowed it, he knew he has expressed something in you. Then ask yourself this morning, ask yourself this morning, how did you come out? The challenge is gone, but you are still standing. The problem is over, you are still standing. The one who created you what he has put inside of you. God, that same God, I said he's working upon you. Yes. filled in virtue. Brother, look away to Jesus. He began to tell us of a tough time that is going to come upon the church as we wait for the coming of the Lord. Amen. Israel prepared to be the king. He began to tell us. He said, "There's going to be a time of trouble." Amen. Jacob's trouble. Amen. He said the world is going to have it. He said but the bride is also going to take their portion and in taking this portion he call it the squeeze and in another place he use the word pressure and it's just very simple. If you want to get a juice out of an orange two methods manually you squeeze mechanically you press. Is that all right? But what is important is that juice will come out. Hallelujah. Or pressing is to have juice. That juice is what you are taking time to pack now. Hallelujah. God is packing you juices now. So that when they squeeze down, you will have something to release because there will be a release. There'll be a quick short one. There will be a demonstration. This king must wear his bride before this generation before he takes you away. Is part of the package of the coming of the Lord. Amen. And then he told us he said he said the the antichrist will tighten up. Amen. Amen. Whether your church have name or no sign board or nothing, it doesn't matter. You already marked. We are not marked by sign board. We are marked by our belief by our faith. Amen. Amen. Amen. In the Bible, he was telling King Gazeros, he said there are people in this your country whose beliefs. Haven't you read it in your Bible? whose values whose diamonds is different from other people and it was describing you and I the prophet said we are the one who believe odd things yeah and by our hotness of belief we are marked and they are going to bring pressure upon us the pressure will come in bringing legislations that are contrary to our values one of these days we shall be lawb breakakers I will be happy to break the law. Hallelujah. No conflict with our values and we break it. Yes sir. And no matter how tough you you pressured us till our time come, you will do nothing. Yes. Yes sir. Hallelujah. That's right. If you want to remain simple, you won't be a Christian. That's right. That's right. will remain civil as as long as civility is broken. Is it what's your scripture for that? Too many scriptures for that. What makes the three Hebrew children a memorial today? They broke the law. Hallelujah. What gives them eternal memorial today? They broke the law. Why are you giving your children Daniel today? He broke the law. And we shall break the law that is contrary to the law. Hallelujah. Yes sir. If you are not ready to carry your cross, you are not ready to follow Christ. The measure of it is left for everybody. As long as the law is not contrary to the word of God, we are the most s. That's right. That's right. I get it very clear. That's correct. For when it conflict with the word of God, right? We will damn your law, you will uphold the world. Because even the enemy testified about us. Do you know why they made the law against that name? These guys have been trying him in so many ways. They tried to keep me with him. It didn't work. When they sh him, he will call them brother. It's you I'm greeting. God bless you. When they did everything, Daniel lived such a life that frustrated the enemy. Yeah. Daniel never went on the drawing board for one day. It was always them that goes back to the strategize. Yes, sir. Oh, hallelujah. That's right. Then one day they told themselves look if we continue like this we won't get this man he's too Christianly to be corrupted then one say you know how to get him let us try him by the law of his God don't read your Bible is there what were they testifying to they knew that Daniel will never break the law of his god so what the enemy was to go and study the law of the God of Daniel not for conversion but to get something to oppose Daniel. You see that why they are stopping the message. They are not studying it for their own salvation but to good against you and I. So be ready for it. It's part of the package of the coming of the Lord. [Applause] And when they studied enough, they said, "This is enough." Said, "Thou shall have no other god." This is not getting king. You are the most successful king we ever knew. That's right. We just want to make you a god for one month. Nobody should pray or bow or worship any other person than you. All those lords has only one aim. Have only one aim than him. Amen. You are the holy him of the devil whether you like it or not. And they will bring things that will bring you under pressure that will really give you a squeeze. The prophet said many will give in thinking that it is better to serve God under the framework of an antichrist than not to serve God at all. You are deceived. There is no service to God using the scheme of the antichrist. Yeah. And when you refuse to give in, you know what will happen? Fellowshipping like this will be attacked. Didn't the prophet said our churches will be closed down and turn to storehouses for weapons. You see why we need to treasure this moment when we still have ability of fellowship and freedom of fellowship. Let us gather everything. That is why the prophet said accumulate everything you can when you can because there's coming a time that you will need every bit of it and it will not be available. Our persecution is coming from the church not from an [Music] outer s. But let me say it again. You have nothing to worry about. Amen. As long as you are giving yourself to this word, as long as you are accepting it, God is backing Jesus. God is fortifying you and preparing you for that hour. That is why in the message look away to Jesus. He said, I've taken time to explain all these things so that you will know how to stand and what to watch out for. We don't watch out for God's coming like the people of the world. We watch out for the coming of the Lord. Amen. By the way, Hallelujah. I say it's in you. Amen. I say it's in you. You just don't realize it. Hallelujah. If I tell you if this was a wall and I tell you jump over this wall, you will say why are you trying to embarrass me? You can jump this side. Is that right? Amen. Now, and I said look, it's in you to do it. You can do it. He said, "No, I don't believe I can do it. I don't believe I can do. I don't believe I can do it." And I will tell you, look, you don't believe you can do it because nothing has provoked it in you. If something provoke it, you will jump over that wall and you'll be wondering how because it is you. Then you say, "What do you mean?" I said, "Let's lock everywhere and let's open here." And 12 lions suddenly appear. You already know the answer. Even without seeing the lion, you already believe you can do it. Are you saying it now? The squeeze, the pressure will provoke you and you will realize that your days in the presence of the Lord has not been away from But in case you are not sure, let me offer you help. Be like Jacob. Amen. Don't assume. God told Jacob when he was with Lava that it is ongoing time. Is that right? Jacob was too busy like many of us. We get too busy. We don't mind fellowship. But God spoke to Jacob. It's ongoing time. Amen. When a man attempt to leave, lover dangle some carrots before him. Sometimes you decide this job that is taking my fellowship and everything, I got to do something about it. And you rise one day, you went to reside. I'll look for something else because my soul is important. How many times that is when the company will say let's say you I don't know how much your money is let's say you have 20,000 rand that is when they will give you 35,000 you said maybe it's the will of God for because why at this time why at this time God must be telling me something sometimes Satan also knows how to tell you something because he would rather keep you weak in the spirit and are strong in your economy. You won't be a problem to his kingdom. It will not be a tra. So Laban came to Jacob and offered him more and Jacob changed his mind about going and by the more he was offered because he became like the managing director and everything. Jacob became too busy to pick the calls of God. God will call him. Excuse me. I'm in the board meeting now. I'll call you back. [Music] He will not call. Some of you are like that. He will not call back. God will look I said this boy that said he will call me back it's been two weeks never call back and God will pick the call again said oh God I'm just about signing 10 million rand project let me conclude it in in less than 5 minutes I'll call you back 5 months never call back but let me tell you something if you are a seed of God God knows how to get you attention hallelujah You will get it no matter how hard out you run. That's right. For his presence, he's just giving you patience. When he's ready for you, he will hold you like this and yes, he won't kill you. He will bring so much discomfort, but you will get home. Hallelujah. If you are like that this morning, I'm offering you easy access. Amen. Back to Christ. But if you don't accept my offer, God will take it further. You know why? If you are a seed of God, God can never lose you. [Applause] And you know why he can never lose you? Because he already offered the thanksgiving. He said, "Father, I thank you that all you gave me, I lose except the son of provision. Yeah. So Christ couldn't attend a thanksgiving on your life and with his thanksgiving. It's not possible. Whatever it will take, listen to me. He has to put you on the bed of affliction. He will do it and yet you will not die because that wasn't his intention. His intention is to bring you back. That's right. Praise God. Let me tell you, is God no replacement for any of his children? It is you that must sit here and it must be you. That is the gospel. When Moses failed, the job waited till he was perfected for the job and came back. He didn't ask God anything. Yes. Uh-huh. Amen. Because God does not change his mind. It original thought remains his only thought. Yes sir. So if he thought of you to do a thing, you must do it. Whether you like it or not. [Applause] Are you with me? So the earlier you surrender, the better it is for your life because the will of the Lord will be done regardless. It is the council of God that shall stand. So run away son, run away daughter. You better come back this morning. Your father is offering you a mouthwatering package. Easy access. If you reject easy access, you will still come anyhow. By a tough access. God will have his way. So when God was ready for Jacob, friends, you know what he did? All those things that constituted value and uh appreciation, God turned it around. Read your Bible. I think Genesis 31 or 30. Laban that made him managing director turned against him. All the sons of Laban who were on the board turned against him. When Jacob looked there, it was hostility. When he looked there, it was hostility. When there was nowhere to turn, he looked away. [Applause] And God said, "Look at you now. Look at you now. You've not been picking my course. Now you are calling me. What if I don't pick your own?" But it's a merciful God. The Bible said he will not always charge. Neither will he keep his anger forever. Amen. And it won't take you know what I was the cause of all your problem. I did it to get your attention and all I wanted to tell you is ongoing time. Hallelujah. Church, it's ongoing time. Amen. Hallelujah. And it was a great revival. Jacob said told his wife, told his children, "We going home. We going home." Everybody started singing, "We are going home. We are going as they were joined rejoicing having revival. Esau at the noise of the revival. You will love this on your way to the rapture. Those are the birthright losers. That is the antichrist regime. They must come your way. It has run through the types of the scripture. You don't get into your inheritance without a fight. The reinforces are already there, but you must announce it. Amen. Hallelujah. So the Bible said Esau was warming up to meet him. You want to come on, you deal with me first. When Jacob added that Esau was on the way, that revival became sober. Amen. So, so this problem is still there. Oh, for the birthight now for the porridge. Oh, for this and that. What must I do? Do you know up till that time Jacob has survived by tricks? A lot of you are surviving by tricks and you think you are smart. You live your dirty lives. You come to the church with clean mouth. You think you are smart. Hey, hey, forgive me. You are the You know why? How would you ever think that God is not seeing what you are doing? How would you ever think that the presence of God does not always go with you, the man who enters all rooms, the doors being shut, whether you invite him or not, he will come. So stop playing dirty games. Hallelujah. Amen. From today dirty life say God is watching me. I'm conscious of his presence. How many do that? How many from today? Whether pastor is there or not. Whether mama is there or not. Whether papa is there or not. There's an allse watching you. [Applause] Hallelujah. Now the hen is coming on to rose. Amen. Because Esau was on the way coming with strong army to confront Jacob and settle the whole score for the last time. Hallelujah. The Bible said Jacob talk of what to do. What must I do? If Esau could fall for a plate of courage, if I send him about 400 cattle, something per degree, it will collapse. The Bible said Jacob sent the cattle. When saw them, he said, "What is this one? I have plenty." Esau had overgrown covetousness. He was a wealthy man himself. So, you couldn't move him with that. So the trick failed and Jacob said what must I do again? All right. Okay. If push come to shove let me arrange the family in the order of importance because some people site chicks today. They have no value. Do you know the concubines were the first one that were rich with their children. Yes. Read your Bible. It was Bill and Villa, her children first that Jacob arranged first. So if what comes, let him catch them first before it got to. Then they put Leah and his and her children number three. Then they put Rachel and her son the last person. So it was in the order of importance to him. And uh but when he realized what if I say he won't kill them all and he wiped out everything. Then Jacob said, "No, let me go and check if I've got what it takes." Amen. To confront my issue. Amen. This is your own personal preparation. I'm winding down gradually. But this is your prepar. What God will do, he will do. The other programs will take care of it. But you must not end up a casualty. In this journey because God has also offered you a way of escape. Do I have what it takes? Yes. Every one of us must come to that junction of personal sincerity. Hallelujah. Don't deceive yourself. Even if you deceive me, it's fine. But not yourself. That's right, sir. There will be a much more casuality. Yes, sir. I'm going to search it this morning to have what it takes to confront my Isa because Isa will come. That's right. That's right. You can preach rapture without his suffer. Yeah. That is why the prophet told you, you got to have a squeeze and a pressure before you enter into your blessings, it will come. Everything you claim, everything you touch, renew, all your whether it's intellectual or revelation, time will prove it because his will be here. Amen. Israel prepared to meet your king. Hallelujah. When Jacob realized that he didn't have what it takes, he knew it would take more than a patched up life. To confront Israel. Yeah, you could survive with tricks on many things, but you won't make it at the time of a squeeze. That's true. Because squeeze is to bring down whatever you are inside. Do you see why now? Amen. So, who are you this morning? I want you to have a personal Easter. Can I bring up that picture? Jacob realized that this was who he was this time portion all around. But there is hope for Jacob if he's ready to accept Christ. You know the hope he has he's got this tiny button. Amen. This dark one is the Jacob. This tiny one is Israel. Did you hear me? I want to make it so simple for you. Amen. Now this is the re in but by natural birth because our natural birth was not God's own divine prescription. True. The process of our natural birth was what Satan took advantage to inject his nature. Amen. Into mankind. Amen. Yes. Yes sir. Amen. Because that was how he was able to produce a son vicariously. Amen. And that was why Cain met every characteristic of Satan. Amen. Do you know Cain lived in the dispensation of innocence and corrupted the innocence? You didn't catch that. There was never an evil done before pain came. My God. So everything Ken did, he had no example. He had no physical influence. It was all inherent in him. It was a package that came as a gym of the devil. He didn't need nobody to teach him. It was already him there. Nobody has ever been hungry before. Nobody had ever been jealous. Nobody has ever had a murderous thought. Nobody knew that carrying a sledgehammer and eating somebody could kill another person. It was all innocent. But Cain did all without seeing an example. You know why? Because he was born son of Satan. Yes. [Music] And everybody who came by that process of birth got this nature imposed on them. It's not your fault. But it becomes your fault when you now know it and refuse to do something. That's right. Did you hear me? So that black guy was Jacob. That black guy was Abraham. But the little button was Abraham. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That black guy was Jacob. The little button in there was Israel. Two of them don't leave, don't operate at the same time. There must be death to one so that the other can be quickened. That will be your personal Easter. [Applause] Amen. Is it simple enough? [Music] So as long as Jacob was Jacob, he can match his own. That's right. Amen. He will perish. Amen. So what must he do? M you must go for a process of death burial. Are you ready to die? Amen. Until you are ready to die. You're not ready to live. This nature must die. What looks like you wasn't actually you. Satan only borrowed your identity to commit all the fraud, all the sin. Yes. This is the one that is born of God. Hallelujah. He cannot sin. [Applause] In the message invisible union, the prophet said, "This is actually you." Amen. Did you catch that? But this was how you look like for now. Because by your natural birth this nature was imposed and it became your identity. That is why the prophet said when that when that dark soul when it dies. Amen. You are not only forgiven, you are justified. Hallelujah. What is your justification? Is as though you never did this. Yeah. And actually we never did it. It was an impossing your intent. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. That is why any man be born in Christ as a new creature. Amen. Now, God does not want this you to separate from this one. He wants this one to actually die. Are you catching it? Are you catching it? Because God is not going to marry a divorce. But Christ can marry a widow. [Applause] But he won't marry a divorce. He can't break his own law. Marrying the devil, it will make him an adulterer. As long a woman is bound by the law of her husband, as long as he lives, the only thing that discharges a woman is if her husband is dead. Then she become open to be taken by another man. That's right. So God will not break his own law. This is why he doesn't want you divorcing it. Amen. He wants it dead. You see the way he's redeeming you is the way is redeeming the earth. That is why before the first quad city can rest on the earth, there must be a fire innovation. There must be a killing. There must be a wiping out. And there must be an annihilation. So this must be completely annihilated before this one takes over. Yes sir. They are not going to govern your body together. No sir. No sir. God will not share you with any man. [Applause] Amen. Hallelujah. Did you hear that? So this was the experience Jacob must have and this is the experience that you must also have. Otherwise you can't make it. Rapture will be a mirage. Amen. So you know what Jacob did? Leave the picture there. You know what Jacob did? He went to the presence of God and he started wrestling it. He was confessing. He was repenting. He was confessing all. He wasn't hiding anything. He was opening all before whom can help me. Hallelujah. Then God asked him. What is your name? He said I am Jacob. Meaning I'm a deceiver. God wanted him to confess. God knew his name. Yes, God has called him several times. So did he forget? Why was he asking what is your name? He wanted him to confess his identity. When you come before God, say it as it is. Stop playing with words. If you are a thief, say you are a thief. If you are an adulterer, say you an adulterer. If you're a fornicator, say you a fornicator. If you a liar, say you are a liar. you will have a better chance in the presence of God. That's right. Don't be playing with words. I am somebody who gets conflrated in emotional embassy fire. And when the fire gets consuming, it makes me do things inappropriate. You even get before God, you want to be stereotyping repentance. you ain't going to make it if you are too sophisticated for a birth. That's right. Don't get pregnant. Because birth can be very messy. Even if you opt for CS, you will still bleed. Amen. This is come to the savior. Let there be a death. Let there be a period. Let there be a Hallelujah. Yes sir. Yes sir. Don't be different. [Applause] That's right. He said I am Jacob. Say you are. So what do you want? That is why I came. I'm a deceiver. I'm sick and tired of it. I need a change. If you need a change, God is ready. Lord, you must see your heart and your mouth in my Huh? There must be harmony. When there is harmony, there is sincerity. When there is sincerity, you will get God. Hallelujah. He said if this change come, you don't walk the same again. You said I'm ready. You don't talk the same again. I'm ready. You don't dress the same again. You said I'm ready. You don't associate with the same people again. He said I'm ready. And when he was truly ready, God was also ready. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] And by the time the change came from today, you are no more Jacob. Hallelujah. So Jacob died. Hallelujah. Jacob died. Hallelujah. And this one Israel came alive and there was no more darkness. The the Israel that has come alive has come in the middle form. But this Israel will go and expand here. By what? By feeding on the word. Hallelujah. Feeding on the word in apostles doctrines in fellowship and in breaking of bread. Yes sir. Huh? Yes sir. You will bring this Israel. Do you have a clear without that one now? You don't have the one without that one. All right. What I'm saying is that he said as this little one, this is Christ being born in him, formed in him. As this little one, Amen, takes over, he keeps expanding. Amen. By the word, he's got to be fed right. Yes sir. When it's taking the balance diet, the spiritual seven men, it starts growing. It starts expanding until it will come to full structure. Amen. That is the man, that will survive the squeeze. That is the man that is preparing for the coming king. And truly brethren, as Jacob left the presence of God, now Israel, his work has changed. The things he used to do, he do them. The way he used to walk, he no more. The life he used to live, he live them no more. It was a great day when he was born. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When he came out Yeah. And Israel, he was ready. He told all his family, he said, "Get behind me." I've got what it takes now to face. I will win this battle. And he began to go and he began to grow. And when it got to Esau, Esau became confused. You know why? He was waiting for Jacob. It was Israel that appeared. [Applause] Hallelujah. Now, now, hallelujah. Can you hold Israel responsible for what Jacob did through justification? [Applause] [Music] Will not make it. Yeah. But his made it. Change your name this afternoon. Change your this afternoon. Lord, if you want to meet the coming have an Easter. I close with this. How many know E? What a beautiful story that was. The king needed a bride. I hope I can give him five ter. Is that okay? If it's not okay, tell me. We come back again. It's okay. All right. The king needed a bride. Amen. And uh 1,000 virgins were gathered for the king to make selection. But these 1,000 virgins, they were all virgins. So they all qualified at least by the law of purity, isn't it? All right. They were all taken to be prepared to meet the king. Amen. And they were handed over to one man called a guy. Amen. Now that is the angle I want to look at it from this afternoon. A guy was the king's keeper of women. But so that he will not be able to be tempted to inject his seed in any of them. He was made a healer. Oh yes. Every true messengers are That is why Paul could say that which I received from the Lord the same. No addition, no suppression. Are you getting it? William Ram said, "I was not the one that appeared at W River. I was only the person name. Yes. You are not feeding on me because a man is what we feed. You are feeding on the unfailing body of the son of man. He was an you. Hallelujah. So for the first 6 months they were undergoing their purification. They were to be prepared for a year. Then the last six months They are to rely on their own knowledge and make requests of what they think they need to qualify them to be the king's choice. It's in your Bible. Amen. Amen. But you see the the interesting thing is that all of these 1,000 virgins will relate with only one man relative to their needs. So whatever your needs are, a guy will supply you. Amen. Are you spiritual? Thank you, Lord. If it's fault you want to find, he will give you plenty to find. Hey there are some fault finding is their preparation. Amen. So they will look critical to the king. Amen. Whatever you need it's available. And each virgin was asking give me this give me that give me this give me that. In fact in fact in fact this was but the Bible made a remark. And this is what got me. He said when it comes to the turn of Esther the daughter of Hab the uncle of Modi. [Music] She did not ask for anything. [Music] It's like you know everybody come what do you need? This is a take. Then Esther came and said, "What do you need?" I don't need anything. But you must go to the king. You're going to need something. Say, "Yes, I understand that, but I don't need anything." Said, "So, how are we going to do?" He said, "Ear, you are the one that is closest to the king. God, you are the one that knows the mind of the king. God, you are the one that is used to the taste of the king. What I need is what you give me. I will never leave on my own understanding. I will leave on yours. Just give me what you feel it's okay and I'll be satisfied. Ah, said at last. You got one who has it up there. So you need me to help you. Okay, Esther, you take this. The king's like this. You take this. You will take this. When you appear, the king will see his reflection and you make it. Are you spiritual to catch it? Even if I leave it as a parable. Hallelujah. He don't need our understanding. God has sent his to give us a message of preparation. He does everything that we have in Lord. He said all you need. Amen. on your translation. Your rapturing faith is laying the message. You need nothing else. Thank you, Lord. You don't need extra study. You don't need extra food. Be satisfied with the message of the hour. Brother Graham said, "If you stay by distance, I will meet you in the morning." I can see Esther walking into the palace. And the king looked up for the first time and the holy time said, "I can see my reflection." Young lady, who taught you this? How do you know what I like? How do you know this is my taste? How do you get my smell? How do you get this? Where is my rod? You are the queen. and soul shall be the same. If you are closed by the message, you shall God bless you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. [Music] Let's give the Lord another good hand of a praise. Amen. Let's stand together. Amen. You appreciate the word of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Don't be in a hurry to go. Amen. Praise the Lord. Those of you that are rushing off, the service is not dismissed. Amen. Deacons, please be at your post of duty. We haven't dismissed the service. Amen. When we come into a combine like this, we ought to obey the law of the church. Yes, sir. Amen. There is order in God's kingdom. Praise the Lord.

If spirits have been tormenting you, if spirits have been afflicting you, amen, give them notice, say, "Holy Spirit, come in. Move past the flesh. Move past the spirit realm. Get the Holy Ghost in your soul. Exposing to that teaching that's in your soul. Let there be a birth this morning." Hallelujah. Oh, great angel of God. We ask you to move across the audience.

Tell them, "I can't wait for the next meeting." Amen. Glory to God. Amen. You're dismissing the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Be holy. He's called in a cloud shining like the sun. And the fire is fall. The seven of course sounds. [Music]
