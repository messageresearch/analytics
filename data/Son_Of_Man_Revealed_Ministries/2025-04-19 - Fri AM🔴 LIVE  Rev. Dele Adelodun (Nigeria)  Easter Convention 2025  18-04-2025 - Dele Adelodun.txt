But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, for he shall predict the mystery of God, which is completed, as he has declared unto his servants, the prophets. We thank you for the offering that has been given by each member of the mystical body. Yes, we pray dear God that the efforts of giving not only not only was to be of receiving but it is given oh God with the love of God that has been constrained in the hearts to be put to use for the furtherance of this conviction in the mighty name of Jesus.

We're also honored to welcome his precious wife this morning, Sister Sharon, who serves faithfully by our brother's side. Give the Lord a hand of [Music] praise. You know, brother and sister, many times we highlight the ministry of the man, but if the man doesn't have a good woman at his side, it can be difficult. So, God bless you, Sister Sharon. Wherever you are, where where you sister [Music] [Applause] [Music] Sharon, sister, God bless you. Together, they've been blessed with four children.

And the first place where he ministered was in Derwin. So this is like a homecoming. [Applause] We believe that when God sends a man, Yes. God gives him a message. Hallelujah. So this morning, we're in anticipation. We under expectations. We want to hear what the Lord has in store for us. May he set out a great outpouring, brother, sister. It's already started as you know. May he continue with that outpouring. Amen. Not only here, but wherever the eagles are gathered across the globe. God bless the Eagles. Hallelujah. Before we hand over the service to our precious brother, we also want to take a moment to express our deep gratitude to all the pastors and the congregations that they represent. Give the Lord a hand of [Applause] praise. I know there's going to be a formal thank you at the end of the service, but I just want to send a thank you up front. Hallelujah. There's they've labored a lot. There's been a lot of labor and they they they've worked faithfully entire sleep to put these meetings together. Amen. Last night while he was sleeping, there were brethren who were setting these chairs 1:00 in the morning setting these chairs. Let's give the Lord a [Music] hand. May God richly bless you for your effort. Amen. And to everyone else who who made the slightest effort towards this meeting, anything you did, anything, if you made a phone call, if you gave someone that anything, God bless you this morning. Unfortunately, a few pastors couldn't be present due to pre-arranged commitments. Amen. So we have apologies from our precious pastor Denzel who was in Zimbabwe for Easter meetings and our dear pastor Rodney who was in Trinidad and he'll be crossing over to the USA for Easter meetings as well. May God bless the dear servants of the Lord.

[Applause] [Music] Are you your [Music] life and my sins are all washed away all my sins [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] May we please bow our heads for a word of prayer. Gracious almighty God, we want to return thanksgiving unto you this morning. Hallelujah. for this wonderful privilege that we have as your sons and daughters to gather around your blessings. Thank you for making us who you have made us. Lord, it is not by power not by might from hurt to glory. Salvation is of the Lord. You said you will have mercy upon whom you will have mercy. Compassion upon whom you will have. We thank you father that we are the one that are on the right side of your church. Thank you for making us vessels of honor. We appreciate you papa God. May you receive our thanksgiving. May you receive our worship. We pray that you will accept all our praise offerings. And the rendering of a grateful heart that we have done in your presence. the special numbers, the beautiful songs, and everything we've done. Your children who have played the instrument, everybody glorifying you and praising you in one way or the other. Father, please accept them. Accept the offering of our purses also. And may you also accept our person. Let nothing, oh God, stand between our soul and the savior. Hallelujah. May you come by in our midst. Have a free flow. Oh God, but don't pass anyone by. May you stop at the post of each individual. May you descend their needs and apply to them the substance of their request and their desires. Lord, you know their needs. I don't know. I pray that you will give me such a yielding that through my vessel, you will express your holy horses. Hallelujah. That will bring healings to the sick. That will bring encouragement to the weary. Restoration to the backslider and edification to the believers. Let there be open heavens. Almighty God, and let your blessings pour upon thy people. Amen. Souls that may still be coming on their way. May you get their part safely here. Those that are in their houses, may you give them a quickening, oh God. Amen. And those who perhaps will be watching this from somewhere, may your people pass from you to us and from us unto them that they might be like partakers of the same blessing that we are going to receive. Are there places where believers are fellowshipping today? Your presence we believe is among us. Let it also be with them that both there and here when the services will be over, we would have caused to give you praise. Amen. We will give you glory. Thank you for our host pastors here. Thank you for everybody who has played one role or the other to make these meetings possible under your providence. Almighty God, I pray that your children will never lose their reward. Hallelujah. Be with us as we open your word now. And may you come out from the pages of the Holy Spirit to reveal yourself to us individually. Amen. The Lord when the services will be over, we'll be lighooted by the energy of the spirit to indeed go and declare through our lives and our testimony that you are alive. You are not dead. Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Applause] Bless you, sir. The Lord bless you. I will please request that we read our Bibles so that when you take your seat you sit once and for all and then when we read the scripture together it will help you to get used to my addiction in case you have problem with my accent. All right. The Lord bless you. We welcome ourselves into the house of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. Okay. If you have your Bibles with you, I want to read uh the same events in the three accounts of the scripture. So I'll start from the book of Matthew chapter 27 verse 50. I want to read three passages given accounts of the same thing uh for which we gathered in this season. Amen. If you are in Matthew chapter 27, I want us to look at the 50th verse. Verse 550. Amen. If you are there, say amen. Amen. Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice uh yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the grave after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many. Amen. Amen. Please take note of that account because each account gave us more information. Amen. All right. Mark chapter 15 verse 37. Mark 15:37. Amen. And Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up a ghost. And the veil of the temple was rent in doing from the top to the bottom. Yes. And when the centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost, he said, "Truly this man was the son of God." Amen. That looks similar to Matthew 27, isn't it? All right, let's progress further. John chapter 19 from where we shall take our subject this morning. Hallelujah. John chapter 19 verse 30. When Jesus therefore had received the venigan, he said, "It is finished." And he bowed his head and gave up the ghost. The Lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy word. God bless you. May please be seated. [Music] This morning I want to thank the Lord so very much. Yes. For the privilege he has given unto us. Amen. Uh to see another Easter and the opportunity he gave unto me and my wife to be in the midst of the believers in this part of the world at this time. Amen. Uh I think before the foundation of the world, this was where God saw us. We couldn't have been anywhere else but this place. Amen. And uh the events that made it possible for us to be here today witness to the fact that this was the Lord's doing. Hallelujah. We applied when the invitation came. uh we had to my wife's passport had expired so we had to do a renewal and uh that left us around March because she said to me that she hasn't been to South Africa for a long time if I don't mind she would like to join me on this trip she she really makes such a [Music] request so maybe a time I have to pull her and say come but this time I think she loves for South Africans. So I said okay. So we got the passport renewed and we applied I think uh what I can say long time enough. Yeah. In March but the for some reasons the visa got delayed uh and they wouldn't release our passport until the visa was ready. So it kept on pastoring we asking me is everything all right I said everything is all right but we are still waiting for the visa and we kept waiting until this week and it looks at a point like well it's not going to work so but I remember telling the church on Sunday I told the believers I said uh We are supposed to travel on Wednesday but as of today we don't have the visa. If there is any of you praying against the [Music] visa I want to please plead with you to pray for the visa. You know I was just teasing the brethren because some of them say okay so pastor you will be away you know things like that. So I told them but I trust to the Lord that God will release the visa and I said uh a sister from South Africa called me from nowhere I think she's here this morning sister Rachel I met her for the first time and she said uh you know pastor we were told you are coming to South Africa and we are just looking forward to your arrival because I know you will make it. So I I kind of take it as a confirmation from God that the truth will be possible. I even mentioned it to the church. I said the sister called and said I know you will make it. So I said maybe that's the Lord speaking. So I want you people who have been praying against it to now set us free. So everybody said pastor we are praying everything will be fine. And I said that's fine. I believe as long as the Lord want us to be here, he will make it possible. So I was given them an instance. I said this has happened before in 2013 when we were invited in Pritoria for a convention also. Uh I said the visa got delayed for no reason until the day we had to travel. And I said it was just 3 hours before our trip. Amen. 4 hours before our trip uh before the visa. no 3 hours before the visa came out. So we asked to go pick the visa and drive another 45 minutes to the airport from the visa center straight. So I said it's still the same God. [Applause] [Music] On Monday night, on Monday night after work hour, after closing hour, we got a message from the embassy around 6:00 7 in the evening that your passports are ready on Monday night after close. So, I was telling my wife, I said, "Did they work late today because this is past closing hour and we're getting a message." I said, "Uh, this this is God there." Then something told me where to travel on Wednesday. Then something told me because later that same night, they said, "Your passport has been sent to the collection center." That same night again around 8:00 p.m. They said, "The passport has been picked by the Korea company that will deliver it to your house." Said, "This is something. I was teasing my wife. I said, "I don't know Embassy can work till 8 900 p.m. in the evening." I said, "This must be something unusual." So then something told me, he said, "Don't wait for the Korea company, otherwise you may have to change your ticket." I said, "Really?" So I told my wife, I said, "You know what? Something told me not to wait for the Korea company." He says, "So what are you going to do?" I said tomorrow if by that's on Tuesday. If by 11:00 a.m. I did not hear from them, I will make ready by noon and get go to their office and demand for a passport. So I didn't know it was God speaking. But 11:00 a.m. I didn't hear from the Korea company. So uh I made ready. I went to the office and they said, "What do you want?" And I said I want our passports. Ah he said why? I said because the embassy gave us this message that our passports are now with you. So when the official they looked at the numbers our reference numbers. He said no our company don't use this reference number. I said so what must I do? He said you have to go to the visa collection office of the embassy and they will direct you where you can pick the visa. So I wanted to go then I turned back I said look that day when they were filling documentation for delivery it was your company I saw that they wrote even though it's not listed here but it's your company I could remember vividly it's your company um envelope that I saw he said but sir our company don't use this reference I said do me a favor go inside and check or do your findings within your central pool before I start traveling all the way for another hour to the place said okay God granted me favor he said okay sir let's do that so he went in took the particulars check this check that sent it to the central pool they were away for about 30 minutes so I was wondering what was going on and I wanted to be sure they will respond on time so that I can get to the collection center before 3 because after they close for public so now it's getting to 1:00 or past 1 and I didn't hear from them so an officer came and said sir we're still working on your case please bear with us so you know what happened after about 354 minutes this man came back with our two passports [Music] so I said uh I said so what happened? He said it's very unusual. This is not our reference numbers but when we sent to the central pole they said the passports are in here. So we had to go and check and we found it. So so we are very sorry. I said we could have disturbed you a whole day. So I said if you had the passport since last night or this morning what is it still doing in your office? Why don't you send it? He said actually we plan to send it on Wednesday. Then I knew it was God who spoke to me on the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know brought it on Wednesday would have missed the flight and they would have had to change with all the complications. So we saw the hand of God in that and uh I want to thank God for that. [Applause] [Music] So it's your prayers answered and uh want to thank the pastors uh who organized this. I know there were quite a number of them for the face they put to it for me was pastor Marvin, pastor Andrean and I want to on their behalf I want to thank everyone and all the pastors whom they made fit to uh bring me into South Africa at this time for the purpose of this meetings. I pray that the Lord will bless them, their wives, their family, and their ministries. And I'll be riding on the platform that they have built in order to be a blessing to the body of Christ. I want to appreciate all the servants of God who are in the audience, the pastors, the ministers. May the Lord bless you all and everyone of you have taken time to come and be part of the meeting. You are such an encouragement to me. uh because when we go to town or come to a place we are not expecting to speak to cheers and to enchant for cheers and uh the gospel is meant for human beings. So it's always a privilege if God give us people to speak to. I want you to know that we don't take it for granted and uh I will do all I can to yield unto God uh so that he can truly minister his blessings unto the people of God. I bring the greetings of the saints back in Nigeria both from our local assembly and uh other assemblies and many other pastors who knew we were coming. They all send their greetings to every one of you. They are doing very well by God's grace and I know they will be happy to know that the believers are fine here. Thank you all. Welcome in the name of Jesus Christ. Yeah. My first time coming to South Africa was in 20 uh 2005. Uh I was invited by pastor Ron Genan who has gone to be with the Lord. I salute his memory very greatly and uh I came in we never met we never knew before but he said he heard about me and he felt that I might be of a blessing or service to God's people so we came in I came with my wife then and then my dear missionary partner and great friend brother one and we surely had a wonderful time do was my first place to preach in South Africa And uh we certainly had a nice time with the saints. We met there. It started from a local assembly. Then it went you know into a program like this and we're able to touch some few places. I had to leave with my wife on account of uh uh family obligations to put the children back to school. But brother one waited he had a little more time and uh I think it was a nice time and since then I've been coming in and out short visit just attend to a program and leave and uh I thank God we could make it again after 20 years to this meeting. So the Lord bless you and we trust that God will give us a refreshing time around his holy word. Amen. Amen. All right. From the scripture that we've read, uh, if the Lord will be our help, which I trust he will, I want to speak on a subject that I called when the Lord said it is finished. When the Lord said it is finished. Amen. Amen. Amen. If you look at all the scriptures that we read from Matthew to the book of Mark, both scriptures were together in their accounts. But they never told us what the Lord said. Yes. Right. They only told us that Jesus cried with a loud voice. Yes. Amen. Yes. Amen. But whatever the voice represented, yes, whatever that voice said, those two scriptures did not tell us. Amen. Amen. So it was a voice. But the words were not decoded. And sometimes that is the way you get God. Yeah. I remember before Alaska sank beneath the ocean, it was a voice, a noise of thunders that people heard. Yes. But it was only the prophet. Amen. When others were hearing voice, the prophet was hearing distinct words. Amen. From that voice. Are you following me? Amen. All right. So uh they had to come to the prophet. What did he say? Because they knew that there must be distant words in that voice. Amen. Yes. But all the people that gather around the prophet couldn't tell what it said. They only heard the voice. Amen. Loud voice. And they went to the prophet. They said, "What did he say?" Because they knew that God will not thunder for nothing. Thunder is the voice of God. But what did he say? Brother Abraham asked to go to God and said, "Brethren, let me ask God if you will want me to tell you." Hey, when they went to ask God if he would want uh him to tell them, God said, "Tell them." And all the voices they were hearing meant one thing. Judgment striking the West Coast. That's right. Amen. That was what they heard as voice. Yes. Amen. Judgment striking the West Coast. And I think two days later, Alaska almost went into the ocean. Amen. Amen. To confirm what the voice said. So, Matthew told us it was a voice. Mark told us it was a voice. But God won't voice or thunder for nothing. What is this voice? Then John. John. [Applause] Who has the most intimate closest relationship? Amen. Yes sir. It depends on how close you are related to God. I want to be slow and easy. We have enough time. Amen. Amen. It depends on your level of relationship with God to understand God. Sometimes you know God calls some people uh he call them his friends. He calls some people brethren. Then he calls some people bride because the prophet said he said now I no longer call you friends. I call you bride. Amen. Not bride to the prophet. Amen. The prophet is does not have the capacity to be your husband. [Music] He must be somebody who established a relationship, a contact between a bridegroom and his bride. So you a bride to Christ. Now we have these three categories of people relating to one man and by their relation their relationship level will determine how much hallelujah they will know of and about this man. Yeah. Are you with me? All right. Even if you are his blood brother, it will come to a time that you know dressing together will need some sort of polite respect. Yes. Yes. Are you here? All right. So the only person who can enter into a closer with a man and a man will unveil himself without any reservation. Yes. And without any sense of embarrassment is his is branch. Amen. Glory. Wonderful. You can tell a friend, "Excuse me, I want to dress up and it wouldn't be an offense." You can even tell your brother that. But you won't tell your wife that. No. Is that right? You tell your wife that something is wrong. And in these last days, God unveiled himself. Mighty God unveiled before. unveiling of God. Now, a man doesn't unveil himself publicly. Amen. It will bad manners. It's a closed relationship. So, there's a category of people whose relationship level will take them to the secret place. Okay, we'll come to some things later. Let's go on gradually. Amen. But what I'm trying to say is that Matthew told us it was a voice. Yes. Mark told us it was a loud voice. But when we came to John Amen. Amen. John didn't mention voice. He mentioned the words of the voice. And what is the words of the voice? He said when he said it is finished the voice is it is finished. [Applause] Hallelujah. And Abraham said what finished. Let's see what finished. Amen. You love him this morning. Let's see what finished. Praise God. Amen. He said, "When is he scripted at the cross, it is finished." That's the prophet speaking. When is he scripted at the cross, it is finished. Sin died. Hallelujah. [Applause] Yes. Because the Bible said, "For this cause was immanifested." Yes. To destroy the work of the devil. Hallelujah. So when this script it is finished, sin died. Amen. Now it's dead. It's done with. It's powerless. It's lifeless. Think of it people. That that sin, the enemy to human beings is dead and lifeless. It has no more effect. It cannot. No wonder that the sun shut off its vision. The stars will not shine. The earth turned black because it was all been redeemed. [Applause] Wonderful. So that is why it is important for us to look at when he said it is finished. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now in John in John we had the voice decoded. But in Matthew and Mark, we have the effect of that voice. So all the scriptures are together. Matthew, Mark gave us information. Yes. On what happened when that voice sounded and John told us the works of the voice. Now when Jesus said it is finished, three things happened. Yes. In three different dimensions. Wonderful. Praise God. Amen. Amen. Three things happened in three different dimensions. So I call you to the journey of those dimensions. On earth something happens. Yes. Underneath the earth something happened. Hallelujah. And in glory something happened. So we have an event in the seventh dimension. Yes. It affected the sixth dimension as it was then. Yes, it affecting it affected the the fourth dimension. It affected the fifth dimension. Amen. Just one word bearing effect in all dimensions. [Music] On earth, the Bible says the veil of the temple renters. Yes. From top to bottom. Amen. I like the description of the Bible. He's always making it very descriptive. Yes. so that you won't miss the message. And the prophet came and said, "The renting from top to bottom shows that it was God who rented it." Amen. Hallelujah. The grave of the temple was renting to and from top to bottom. Amen. Is that right? Amen. And uh in the in below the graves of the saints. Yes, sir. Amen. Not the ones in the fifth dimension, the ones in the sixth, the paradise that was emptied. The graves of the saints were opened. Amen. Preparatory for resurrection. Just by that word, it is finished. And in heaven, the bleeding lamb, yes, went to stand before the throne. Hallelujah. to make a demand for the book that will help him to make a redemption. [Applause] Amen. And these are the things we're going to look at. Because we must bring Easter personally to you. Are you here? Many times we talk about historical Easter. Yeah. Yeah. But you know what? The last Easter message of the prophet was it is the rising of the sun. And it got much to do with the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Did you hear me? It hasn't much to do with the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It's got more to do with your own resurrection. That is why the prophet in the message it is the rising of the sun. He said, "I want this Easter to mean more yes to you than any Easter ever." Most Easter that we celebrate is that of the resurrection of Christ. But he came back in that message. He said what it did for him. It has also done for you. Yes sir. Amen. Then he said the same scripture that applied to the bridegroom has also applied to his bride. So I'm not speaking on he is risen this morning. I'm speaking on she is risen. [Music] Yes sir. That was the last Easter the prophet celebrated before he left here. Amen. In 1965, he gave a thanksgiving message. Amen. And he said, "I want to thank God that what God asked me to come and do has been accomplished." He said, "God asked me to come and establish relationship between a heavenly bridegroom and his empty bride." And when he saw that accomplished, hallelujah, he said, "I want to bring a thanksgiving message." because he saw his own purpose of coming accomplished. Yes, that was why brother Brown didn't need to live past 1965 because he had said earlier that once my purpose is accomplished, I don't even want to wait another month. And when he saw that accomplished, he offered a thanksgiving before November thanksgiving he had in April bringing Easter message said I want this Easter to mean more to you. Yes. And if you study that message, you know, spiritually, you will realize that his emphasis was not on Christ resurrected. Yes. But he was showing you by the resurrection of Christ. How the bride has also resurrected. Yes. He said we are resurrected out of dark death and we have been brought out of the economy of love this year that was dead into the economy of a bride age where the presence of God is that is your history and that is what we are celebrating because what happened to Christ has happened to us. Amen. Yes. That's right. Glory. So be looking at these things, all these dimensional blessings that came by the message. It is finished. Now the Easter, it's actually as of today the real Easter celebrants are the gentile bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Now what we are doing as of now meant nothing to the Jews. Yes. Yes. Because they deny the advent of the Messiah. Amen. So if they deny his advent, they also deny his resurrection. Amen. Because their fathers even though they have the witness of the resurrection among them. Yes. Yet they paid heavy sons of bride. It's in your Bible. Amen. The fail sons of bride to bribe to suppress the news of resurrection. That's right. But the news of resurrection is unsuppressible. If there's a word like that cannot be suppressed. You know why? It was a reality. The soldiers that were bribed, they saw resurrection. They saw it. Even those who were bribing, they were afraid. Yeah, they knew that he will resurrect. That was why they came to Pilate. He as that deceiver. You see, his death was a problem. Yes, his living was a problem. His death was a problem, his restoration a problem for the critics, for the kingdom of darkness. But they couldn't stop him. They said that deceiver says that if he is killed he will raise the church dead. Well, who is the deceiver here? No, no, no, no. Who is the deceiver here? These were the same people who denied. Yes. The understanding of what he said. Amen. When he said you destroy this temple and I will build it in three days, do you know they twisted it? Yes. to say he said he will destroy our temple and rebuild it. And you would think they didn't understand what he said, but I give you to know they understood. But they must always look for an accusation. Anyhow, remember they brought up many accusers, but because their words did not agree, they started listening to the tapes to see if they can pick just one thing. Sure. And they said this one is enough. Now if you think they never understood, they came by the same message to the pilot and said this deceiver said if he is destroyed, he will come up in the third day. They were referring to the same message they twisted. When you lie, you can never be consistent. No matter no matter how how skillful you are in line because lying is actually unnatural to your human chemistry. It was an imposition of a fallen nature. Yes. So it will always betray you anytime anywhere. That is why you struggle a whole lot to maintain the course of life. But if you speak the truth, when you are sleeping is the truth. When you are woken up unconsciously, it is still the truth. You will say the same thing. So this word came and said that deceiver said on the 10th day he will rise up. So the governor said uh what is that to me? We want to make sure that it does not rise. So they were confused. They have nightmares over the night. We have killed this man. But if he ever gets up as he said, which by their fear they knew it was possible. [Music] So they came around to block the resurrection so that even if he gets off it will not be able to come out and he will by suffocation red again. That was their skill. That was their plan. That was their scheme. But what they didn't realize is that many words of God were at stake. Yes, sir. That's right. Amen. Many things we are at stake. If Jesus failed to get up and the prophet in the message restoration of the bride, he told us that God does not struggle to bring his word to pass. He said anytime he speaks, he allocates a power behind that statement. And I tell you, God to sleep knowing that when he appointed time for that word to fulfill is still the power we wake it up. Nothing can resist the words of God. Just see the Lord and never fail. It's a promise for your life. It's a promise for anything and God revealed it to you on this very time. The strength of Israel can never lie. If you are rejected this morning, big fresh courage because there will be a performance of everything God promised. No matter what your circumstance is showing, we don't live by what we see. We don't live by how we feel. We live by what we believe. came will go. What are circumstances, they will grow. Even human beings are saying no condition is permanent. The only thing permanent is the word of God. All things are possible. Lord is going to make sure. Amen. Amen. So Satan wanted to disprove the words of David. Thou will not leave my holy one in hell. Neither will you suffer him to see corruption. He wanted to disprove that. When Job said, I know my redeemer and I know in the last days I shall see. Even though they once destroyed my body, yet in this body you must seen another body, a better body, a glorified body that looks exactly like this one. He said, "Yet in my shall I see the Lord? Whom I shall see for myself? Whom I shall behold and not another." Satan wanted to disprove that word. Let me tell you there was more stick for God than for you. And this is the reason God will always watch over his work to perform it. So, so, so the pilot said what do you want me to do? It's like saying your troubles are too much. You fought this man in life. You are fighting him in death. You want to find him in resurrection again. What kind of a people are you? Said you have the watch, you have the soldiers, you have everything. Go and seal it. Go and protect it as well. Oh, hallelujah. And I can see them taking authority. And mountain garrisons secure the whole place. And they use the Roman seal. Yeah. Yeah. Because they got the seal of Rome. Yes. and seal the grave. That even when he gets up, he will die dead. Hallelujah. But on the third day, look at that. On the third day, my Bible told me, an angel swept down from glory. Right in the presence of the soldiers, an angel swept down from glory. We become trottting soldiers. We sought dropping soldiers and angels fell down from glory, broke the seal, blow away the soul and sat upon it. He call me if you can. [Applause] He broke the seal. He rolled the stone away and it sat upon the stone. Amen. That's not even Jesus. That's his angel. You You give too much credit to Satan. Satan is just a little to a to in the hand of God. Do you know when people say Satan and God is fighting, it's an insult. Who fighting who? Can Satan actually fight God? It's not possible. If God is allowing him, it's because he's part of the program. When the programs are all done, listen to me. God is going to send just one ordinary angel. The Bible said so. Yes, sir. It didn't say it's Gabriel. It's not Michael. He said that angel will come and b Satan with a chain of circumstance. He will leave it in the condition that he cannot act for 1,000 years. Ordinary angel will b Satan. You are telling me Satan is God's opponent. When the ordinary angel [Applause] Hallelujah. Oh, this angel came down. He broke the seal, rolled away the stone, sat upon it. I said, "You guys try me if you and the Bible said for his fear all the soldiers. For God made sure they saw everything that happened." Yes. Because there must be a report given. Yeah. So when they manage to escape for their lives, they run to their principles. So tell you what, what do we saw the man resurrected during that deceiver? Keep quiet. The man resurrected. We saw it came out. [Music] Did you mean you saw him? You mean he rose? So even the critics knew there was resurrection. You can't deny it. Now watch what they do. So, you know what is going to happen? Name your prize. The soldier said for what? To deny resurrection. As they were opening their mouth, ah ah they were stomping it with millions of [Music] R. So what do you want us to see? We are going to organize a press conference for you. You are going to say while you were sleeping, his disciples came to steal his body. Look at an inconsistent lie again. Somebody is sleeping and yet he knew those who spoke. [Applause] Was it in the [Applause] Whoso coverth sin shall not prosper. An attempt to cover sin does not prosper. Expose sin at the truth so you can leave. He said when we were sleeping you were sleeping and snoring and yet you knew the criminals. Does it hard enough? It's not hard enough. If you were sleeping, you were sleeping. He said while we were sleeping, his body was stolen. If you could tell who was stealing his body, then go arrest them. Did you ever hear the disciples were arrested? Because they knew they were lying. But see the effect of lie because many loveth evil Yes. more than righteousness. The Bible said it became a common sin. Yes. That his body was stolen. Amen. Amen. And even Joseph was and some historians began to write that the communion they do was the body of Christ they preserved and we are cutting small. I was wondering how big that body will have been to have lasted them the whole for communion. Yes. Yes. Amen. And you would have expected Jesus Christ to do something about it. But God does not fight like you fight. While that was going on, while the lies was going on, the Bible said Jesus was appearing to his own. Yes. Empowering his own. Yes. So many lies are going on in the world. But Christ is appearing his own. He's empowering his own. He's building a body of an army. Who will overrun everything the devil can present? And for 40 days, he was doing that. When he finished, the Bible said he left. Yes. Because the job of the defense of resurrection or the proof of resurrection was not the ministry of Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Christ did not die for himself. He wasn't buried for himself. He didn't resurrect for himself. He did it all for you. say you are the beneficiary and you are going to have the token the receipt of resurrection it is when you present the token of resurrection that indeed the world will know his reason so for Christ to be provoked to express himself he will have broken his own program so he live quiet while the lies were going on but let me tell you Christ will never let it have passed. He will defend it. So when he left when he left it sent the evidence of resurrection yes to the disciples. Yes. Amen. Amen. And a a scarce denying Peter wax so bold. So much so that on the day of Pentecost he brought 3,000. Bye bye bye. Then one day after Pentecost as they were going to the gate beautiful Yes sir. Listen to me brethren. They saw a man who was a notable living fellow. Amen. Is that right? And everybody knew this man. This man probably lived when Christ was there. Amen. But Christ never raised him up because he was meant to be an evidence to his resurrection. [Applause] Glory. Christ does not forget. Amen. Neither will he commit omission, error of omission or commission. Yes, he knows what he's doing. Amen. He never held a press conference to show himself. It's a lie they are talking about me. I actually resurrected. You're a man. He never did it. But he did it for somebody who was his home. There was a Thomas in his group. Yes. Who said what are you talking about? Except I see that fingerprint nail print. Except I see inside I will never believe. There was one of his own. And the Bible said he came. Thomas Thomas and he said my word and my God. He said Thomas don't be faithless have faith. Whatever I say can never fail. He said now you believe because you saw but blessed are those. Jesus was speaking of you and I will not see and yet we believe. God said if we are children of God and sometimes our faith level is weakening. He said God will do everything he could to give us an assurance. He's there to tell us he can come to you but he doesn't do it for everybody. God is only obligated to his own seat. He has no obligation to the children of K. [Music] Revelation is only meant for the children of God. That is why you see God. Amen. When he was here in flesh, he speaks in parables in a public gathering. Hallelujah. Or when he comes into the closeness, he unveils himself. He gives revelation of the parable. And even the disciples were confused. They said, "How come outside you speak in paragles and inside you speak in plain language?" He said, "The reason is very simple. Unto you it is given. It's not meant for the outsider, it's meant for the insider because it is spiritual food in season. Is not available in Egypt. It is for goian children. [Applause] Hallelujah. So he never had a press conference to defend himself. But you know what he did? He empowered the generation to be with the proof that he is risen. So this man at the gate, beautiful, saw three men coming, welldressed, nicely, nice looking. And the Bible said he looked up onto them. Yes. To see he must have sized them all. This one in the middle might be able to give 20 rounds. This one on the left, the way I'm sitting, he could afford 50. And maybe this one on the left, on the right, could do 100. But in between them, between 150 to 200 G will be here. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know the value of your money. Maybe it's something big or something. But whatever it is, you feel it should be there. But I when they when the men approached, they said silver and gold. Amen. As big as you are, as nicely dressed as you are, oh God, things are not working for you in why don't you go back to your village. But before he could finish his thoughts, they said, "Such as we have, they don't have silver, they don't have gold, or they've got a proof of resurrection. [Applause] They got a token, they got the heavens, such as we have, we give unto you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. rise up and walk. And the Bible said a surge of energy came on the man and maybe he struggled to get up and they give him a hand and he began to lift. He began to walk. He began to praise the Lord. And in doing that his legs come fully straightened and it became a news everywhere. These old guys were confused again. We touched, we touched, we touched. Amen. Said, "Go arrest those guys." And you know what? When they blocked them, they were interested in only one thing. The Bible said that a notable miracle was done. They couldn't deny, but they wanted to know how. In what name? Satan fought that name in Genesis. Hallelujah. He fought it in the beginning of the Bible. He fought it in the middle of the Bible. He spoke blasphemy against it in the book of Revelation. In what name? And Peter said, "You really want to know? Amen. You really want to know, we are not afraid to tell you. Now you organize press conference. Let us tell you, everybody must gather. Amen. And he said, you see, uh don't think it is by our own power. That we raise up this man. But in the name of Jesus, wait for it. Who you crucify? For the Lord raised from the dead. Hallelujah. So all the blood they p was wasted because here in the public is the news of the resurrection and the evidence of resurrection whom you crucified but our Lord raised. So Jesus rest, Jesus raised Jesus resurrect [Applause] through faith in his name. This man is standing today. Hallelujah. God knows how to fight his battle. Amen. And on and on. The proof of the resurrection ran through seven church ages. Yes. Till it came to this last church. So we become the final proof. Yes. that he is alive. He is not dead. God bless you. Okay. Okay. Pream done. Are you still okay to pray a little more? Amen. Praise the Lord. So we said when it declared it is finished it affected several dimensions. The first dimension that was quickly noticeable was on the earth when the veil of the temple entered. We'll deal with that this morning. Amen. Then the graves of the saints were opened. Then all glory, the bleeding lamb stood before the to take the book. Lord, [Music] the veil of the temple that rented was not the veil of the outer court. There was actually no veil in the outer court. Amen. Was not a veil in the middle court, but it is the veil that separated the middle court from the holiest of the holy. Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. I know you understand that. Amen. Amen. Now why did the veil have to read it in the book of Genesis when men fell. Amen. Or before men fell. God put his son Adam on the earth. Amen. You are familiar with him. Amen. And his wife which was called the woman. Yes. She wasn't Eve. Amen. Eve was a name adopted after the fall. When she became the mother of all living, meaning she become the mother of the good and the bad. Inside her was the seed of God through Adam and the seed of Satan through the serpent. That was what gave her the name Eve. But her original name speaking was woman. something taken out of the man. Are you with me? Now, God was happy to live in heaven, but he needed a governor on the earth. Amen. And if you could get the right governor, he's pleased to stay there. Amen. Amen. While his son take charge here. Amen. And that was why when they brought Adam, he brought him in a full adopted mode. Yes. He didn't have to grow. No. He came grown. It's the ground running. Because he was the son of God. Yes. In all sense of the word. Amen. That was why his first appearance in the garden. Yes. Was a spirit being because it was a scoop taken out of God. Spirit begot spirit. Yes. Are you with me? But now being in the spirit form, he will not be able to relate with things that are physical, tangible, and earthly. So in order for there to be fellowship, God had to condense his makeup and make him look like his subject. It was all God's plan. I hope I'm making it simple enough. It was all God's plan and design. Amen. Amen. Then God put when God was to bring his wife, he didn't bring that wife as a watch right from his person, right from his being like he did the man. Yeah. Amen. And that is the use of the word. That is why the prophet used the word byproduct. It's not a derogatory word. It's to show that something was taken out of something. Yes. Amen. Amen. But they are all origin. It's all from God. Because when Adam was here as a spirit man, even when he was put in the body of flesh, he had both feminine and the masculine spirit all enclosed in him. Are you with me? That was why the scripture was using day for a singular person. You have male and female created in them. And he was referring to only one person because this one person carries the two and through a process of surgery anesthetics and surgery the wife of Adam was brought out of Adam. Now the prophet told us that there was a reason why our creation had to go through that level of condescension. Amen. Amen. Because in God's back touch, he is to use her as a tool to bring his total mind. Amen. Satan never had any chance in this program. When you look at what you know what happened, you will thank God that you on the sight of God's righteousness because it was the God who made all for his own pleasure. Amen. Yes, sir. Satan bringing an interruption to God's program as we say is not by his own capacity. It is God himself who upset his own program. [Music] Satan lacks the capacity to do it. God wanted to eat his cake and have it back. And he actually did. Yes. Because in the beginning, the prophet said God loves two desires. You with me? He has a desire to be God. Yes. And he has a desire to be known beyond being God. Yes. Because inside him we are enclosed with many attributes. Attribute means abilities. Amen. Amen. But as long as perfection remains, yes, all those other attributes of God cannot be expressed. And let me tell you, it is the expression of those attributes that actually connected us in intimacy with God. Thank you. Otherwise we will worship him like religion a distant god who will only give him sacrifice he has no relationship with us but god wanted to be related with you and the holy man can be related with you is to express his attributes but those attributes cannot be expressed except there's a form yes amen Amen. Because he has an ability to heal the people. If nothing ever get sick, we wouldn't need that. He can save. If nothing is lost, there's nothing to say. He can redeem. If nothing is out of place, there's nothing to bring back. You can deliver. If nothing gets in bondage, there's nothing to deliver. Amen. So God has to create a condition to offset his own affection. [Applause] You can see that Satan wasn't in the picture. This was way back in eternity. So Lucifer becoming Satan wasn't accidental. It was all in the plan. Amen. Hallelujah. That was why the prophet used the language when describing the work of Satan in the garden. He said, "And when Satan has brought to pass that which was necessary Yes. to the purpose of God. That's right. Yes. Some things are necessary to the purpose of God in your life. Amen. And there will be things that are upsetting. There will be things that are negative, but because your salvation is already finished. There is no circumstance on earth, whether good or bad that can send you to hell. That is the living that we know that all things. Did you ever read that in the Bible? All things, all means all inside. You have the good, the bad, the ambivalence is above all things work together for good. Your failures work together for good. Your success work together for good. Your abilities work together for good. Your insufficiency work together for good. For them that love God, for them who are de By the way, not anybody to the predestinated. That is why Paul said what can sound that thing hasn't been created. Hallelujah. And will never be created. Does it make us complicit? No sir. It makes us understand the mysteries of life so that even sometimes in our failure we don't allow the devil to take advantage and send us into an oblivion. Amen. He said if the righteous fall seven times he will do what? He will rise seven times. The difference between us and Satan is this. When Satan fell, he never rose again. Satan permanently. But when a believer fall, he will rise up. This is the difference. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. So, the Lord brought her The Lord brought the woman and he also created a creature called the serpent not the snake. Amen. It was the serpent. And what is the essence of this serpent? In the me serpent said, brother Ara said it was a creation animal that was created with the knowledge of the understanding of the principles of life. Yes, sir. Amen. Yes. Yes. He knows what to do with every member of his body. He doesn't need an outside intelligence to teach him. It was all inherent. And why did God make him like that? For the devil to find a tool tool when he comes into the garden. Yes. Because Lord knows he will come. Do you hear me? The iniquity that was found in the devil didn't take place on the earth. It started right from heaven. So the Lord knew it will come. And he made something useful for him. Amen. So when the devil is claiming victory, God is laughing in the background. This guy doesn't even understand that I'm only using him to bring to pass my own purpose. Satan is the dumbest. [Applause] When he created a woman, brother says, when he created a woman, some features were necessary. Yes. That will be catalyst for the fall. That's right. But his holiness couldn't put it. He allowed the devil to make an impute. That is why sisters don't glory in their beauty and they don't worship their beauty. You have figured [Applause] if you are doing that you are becoming an unconscious tool of the devil [Music] that is why sisters don't worship compliments especially from strangers. [Applause] There are people who are alien to our divine economy. Hallelujah. The Bible said outside the dog eats dog. So when they complimenting you, they are putting you up for a showdown. Hallelujah. Those shapes and things you are worshiping, they are actually giving you by the devil. That's the message. And said, you can be a big truth to God or you can be a big truth to Satan. The choice has to be by you. Amen. Hallelujah. Now staying up there, he gave his power, all his rights, all his authority to one man called Adam. Yes. The prophet said Adam held the title dude of the earth. Amen. We call it certificate of occupancy. Some call it title. Whatever it is, it's what confers ownership from the roots. Amen. Amen. So, but when it fell, Amen. Amen. The prophet said is built a title. But before the devil could get a hold, the Lord strikes them from glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And took a title. [Music] Amen. So Satan lost. That's right. And that is why today is a scatter. Yes. He's not the owner. He might be the God of this evil age. He's only the God of cosmos. He's not the owner of the earth. This earth belong to us. Let me tell you even in our falling state we on the earth that is why our eternity will not be spent in heaven. It will be spent on earth. Hallelujah. After the Lord renovated, we shall be back there. And Jesus is not going to live in heaven. He's going to live right here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When the title left, man lost his ability to hold on to the control. Yes. Of the earth. When he was in hability, he didn't need any technology. Yes. To assist his living. Amen. Amen. Church Adam lives by spoken word and we have the spoken word restor. We are living by spoken word connecting back to our beginning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Everything Adam wanted was by his mouth. Amen. If he's going in the midst of the garden and maybe the three have grown and so flourish until the branches are covering his pathway. It doesn't need a maj. It doesn't need an axe to prune the branches of the tree. All it does tree adjust yourself. The tree will look master. The prophet said everything obeys Adam. Are you with me? If he's passing through and maybe a big river or sea is on his path, it doesn't need a can a boat or ship. He just keep walking. And it is the waters that will be saying, "Oh, master is coming. What must I do? Shall I gather more gravity under me to hold him while he walks over me? Or shall I just open up for him so that he goes through a dry ground. [Applause] He's looking too real. He's looking too material. My brother, God gave you a Moses who opens the sea. He gave you a Peter who walked around the sea. He gave you a Joshua who spoke to the son. All those were sons of Ed to show to you how it was in the beginning and for a return. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] That's how it's going to be, friends. That's what the prophet said. Time is coming that missing limbs. Yes. Not by surgery will be restored again. He said now we pray. He said then we shall speak. Time is coming that our needs will not be met. We looking for money to give money. We'll just speak and heaven will respond. We are on our road. Yes. If we're not arriving yet, that's divine program. Glory. Hallelujah. Let me tell you, there is nothing waiting for you in the future that you cannot be that you cannot start enjoying in new forms. Otherwise, earnestness of redemption and fullness of redemption doesn't make sense. That's right. Yes. The ears is to give you a forage of the greater things that are waiting in the future. This is why we must be having some blessings now. [Applause] Change your mindset because the Lord is on the Lord has done his restoration. Yes. So the title was spilled away. And as a mark for that, the Bible said God mounted God said man has touched the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Lest he put forth his hand into the tree of life. Hallelujah. in his sinful estate. And there will be a carrier of God's revelation and eternal life. He said, "Let us block the path." Yes. Amen. Amen. Wonderful. So the path to the tree of life was blocked by two childrens. Amen. That's what the Bible said. Yes. So that man in all his movement will not be able to go towards that direction. Yes. But I want you to know it wasn't God's intention to permanently block it. [Music] So as a memorial of blockage, listen to me, God in order to carry that memorial with his people, he started signifying it through types and shadow. So when they started their journey in Israel, he brought it back as a tabernacle in the wilderness. Amen. He said when you create the tabernacle make three courts. That is the t you saw this morning that we read about the veil of the temporary make it into three court. Do you know that the first two courts is accessible? Amen. One accessible by the congregation the other by the ministers but the third court is only accessible by the high priest. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And until the high priest accesses that place once in a year, the people are not righteous, the people are not confirmed holy. Their sacrifice is not acceptable. So worship is not complete. Yes. Until we get into the holiest of the holies. Are you with me? Worship is not perfected and no man can become perfect until we get into the holiness of the holy. The holiest of the holies all through the old testament was packed as a memorial. But nobody could go in there. Even the high priest that went had to be sure of what he was doing because mistakes were not allowed. Amen. And people live by this memorial all through. What was in the holiest of the holies? The heart. Amen. Amen. The cover of the heart had two children using their wings to cover. And what was inside? A portion of the man that was preserved that can never decay was placed inside the house covered by the cherub signifying the tree of life again but it wasn't God's intention to permanently keep it because until it is partaken of yes or parttook of by you and me our relationship with him is not complete. Amen. This is why the prophet said, "Amen, the man who comes into the outer court, repenting and taking the name of the Lord in water baptism, he said he has tried, he has left the world, he's coming to God, but we cannot trust his experience." You know why? Yes. Even though he's been baptized into the fellowship of the saints, and we now call him brother, we call him, we call her sister, yet the root of sin is still inside of us. Is still inside of him. Sin can still come as a grave. Amen. Hallelujah. That's right. But is our brother is our sister inducted to our fellowship by water baptism. But in the real sense of the word is not yet a Christian. That's right. And you have them in the church. Hallelujah. They still crave to do those things. They still want to live immoral. They still want to dress the border. They still want to smoke. They still want to do all the things of the Lord. But they love the Lord. When they in the house of God, they just want to serve God. By the feel of the environment, they can go on a high up. But the moment they go out, it's it's over. If you are like that this morning, there is hope for you. You said is it natural? No, it is natural. You are just at the stage. But a journey has begun. If you can hold on in faith, grace will carry you through. Hallelujah. [Applause] When that man or that woman you know stays in there, the prophet said is at the mercy of the weather because in the outer court there's no covering. So sometimes it is too sunny. It feels the heat. and it's hot inside. Sometimes it is too cold. He feels the chill and he becomes touch inside. His experience is undulated and controlled by changes in way. So you can't really trust him. But one day he moves into the middle court. In the middle court there is covering is no under the mercy of the winner. Yes. But it comes under the mercy of the golden lampstand. But you see this golden lampstand also needs maintenance. So it's not a perfect economy here. You got to maintain him all the time. The pastor has to check on him all the time. Brother, how are you doing? Is everything getting better? Tell me something is wrong. I can pray with you. I can pray for you. So every now and then you must watch it. The prophet said you need to keep pouring oil into the golden lampster into the lampster to maintain the light. And he said he said watch sometimes the wicks that carry the oil into the fire could sometimes get carbonized and if you are not careful to peel the carbon you can have a conflration. That is why sometimes you stay months and you feel that this is like heaven to me and after some months you find yourself doing things that are funny or if pressure comes your way and you just give in. Pastor, I thought I was a Christian. Hallelujah. But don't worry, you are still on the job. That negro sister said, I want to thank the Lord that even though I am not yet what I should be but I want to thank God I am not what I used to be. So the journey has started. If you keep waiting on God, if you don't get the story, you will strike it one. It may be in this service that some of you will strike it and you will have it from that time. [Music] [Applause] My brother, my sister, when that person moves from the middle court and it comes into the holiest of the holies, Oh hallelujah. The root of that sin, not only the branches approach, but what makes him live like that, it's uprooted completely by the fires of God. And the spirit of the Lord takes his occupation and starts expanding from that time. Sin does not come from inside. It doesn't come as a blame. It could be bothered about the challenges outside. Listen to me. Because it carries a body that is irredeemable. The redemption of our body is a change of our body. Are you with me? As long as we live here with tongs of the Holy Ghost, this one is unredeemable. The best that can happen to your flesh is a subjection. Yes. But it takes an inner power. It takes he that is in you that is greater than the flesh that is greater than this world. The world around you is your body. Hallelujah. He that is in you is greater than the world. It takes that one to put this under subjug. When this one see evil, he wants to fellowship. But because the householder is Christ, you will say not here. Get out of here. You cannot stop evil thoughts from flying. But you can stop it from roosting. You can stop him from establishing it. Hallelujah. So what defies you does not come from inside the head. What can challenge you is from outside. And it has a collaborator on your body. But because the greater one is in there, hallelujah. It will put your body under subjection. And as your body begin to get used to the new order. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It start a repellent. Hallelujah. And you begin to receive more of the word. As more of the word comes, more of the devil disappear. Yes, said don't struggle to quit anything. Just keep accepting the way. Keep accepting the way. It brings more of God. It brings more of God. until one day you will testify it is no longer I that liveth but that is that man that is that woman in the holiest of the holies that is the proof of his resurrection so these articles were carried as a memorial till our lord came Glory in the heart the cherubamies were still guarding the tree of life. Amen. In that heart in the holiness of the holiness symbolizes that the path to the tree of life was actually still why will it be gathered? Because there must be a perfect atonement. Yes. To release it. Amen. Amen. Amen. The blood of bulls and lambs only made a covering. We need something that will not only breach the chasm or remove it completely. Hallelujah. That's what we need. And we saw our Lord Jesus Christ coming and he came healing the sick, raising the dead and everybody got happy and excited and they could testify to the goodness of the Lord. But friends, that wasn't why he came. Amen. Amen. Those were just attraction. Amen. To show to the people that the savior has arrived the lamb of God that will carry away the sin of the world. He will die as a lamb but he will be buried as a ghost. Brother said all the shadows of the old testament has got to be fulfilled. He said in the old testament you have two goals. When it comes to scapegoat theory, that's right. The Bible didn't use a lamp there. He used two goats, he said one will be killed and the blood of the one killed will be put upon the one that is alive to run away into the wilderness. He said is running away is a type of burial taking it completely out of memory. Hallelujah. So we have the lamb king. Amen. Christ must die as a lamb. Yes. In order to become your perfect atonement, but the blood of your cleansing must be buried. Amen. Somebody must carry it. So his death was as his barrier to carry your sin far away into the sea of God's forgetfulness. So he was your man. He was your scapegoat. That was why on the cross, Amen. the the one who knew no sin became your sin. [Music] And when it became sin, that eternal spirit, the fullness of God had to vacate that because he won't dwell in uncleanness. You were the one unclean. But he had to represent you in totality. He has to become you. Amen. So that you can become him. Hallelujah. It wasn't just a substitute. Amen. It took your place completely. Yes. He wasn't just a representation. He became the sinner you. Yes. Amen. He carried your sin completely in his body. Because he must carry it away. He said, "Behold the lamb of God that carth away the sin of the world." Wonderful. So we behold him in Gethsemane. Amen. Gethsemane was a pre-trial. Gim was the labor room. Was the labor room. Follow me now. That was the labor room. When a woman is getting due, a pregnant woman is due, the first place they take her, I think, is the labor room. Dear she labels and traveled birth pains happen. Amen. Amen. When birth pains come to climax. Yes. And she's fully dilated to release the baby. Yes. She's moved from the labor room into what? Delivery room. Amen. Gethsemane was the labor room. [Music] You know why? When Christ went to the cross He carried you and high inside of him. Let me prove that to you quickly. That you are the real celebrant of Easter. Amen. When Christ was here, he told his disciples, "Do not go in the way of the Gentiles." How many remember that? That's right. Was it because he hated the Gentiles? No. No. The Gentiles got the best package. I tell you, He called the Samaritans French. Yes. He called the Jews brethren. He called the Gentiles bright. Hallelujah. Every time Christ is afflicted by his brethren, he find comfort in the gentile. Hallelujah. When Joseph was afflicted by his brethren, his comfort was asinat. [Music] [Applause] Before his brethren knew him, already knew him. And by that knowing, she became impregnated. Yes. And gave a replica of Joseph twice. Hallelujah. Did you catch Hallelujah? So this blindness of the Jews, Amen. is very perfect. Yes. Amen. When they pushed him out, we always have it. Yes. So in the times that in this program, it was to deal with his brethren. Amen. Amen. The radical Gentiles were pushing hard to get to him. Yes. Then one day some Greeks maybe they've been coming around every once in a while. Yes. And all the deacons and the Jewish, excuse me, we don't mind about their fellowship. We want to see the pastor. You can see the pastor. But one day these Greeks were so determined. I don't know how their faces look like. But this time around when they came even the disciples knew they meant business. Yeah, they couldn't say go. No, maybe when one of them want to say go maybe want to say go and look at their faces are not smiling. Okay, what do you want sex? We will see Jesus. [Applause] Look at look at the language. They didn't say we want to. Can we please? It's a question whether you like it or not. We could sing. [Applause] So they were instant and by that they said let's escalate it. Let's escalate it. So one tell Philip tell Andrew and Andrew went and tell maybe okay and Andrew and Philip went to when Philip told Andrew he said I can't do it you are the one they saw let's go together when they came to the Lord let's hear what they say give us the first line and Jesus answered them the hour is Hey, hold it there. Andrew and Philip said, "Pastor, those Greeks, they are here again today, but this time around, we couldn't resist. You need to come talk to them." And instead of our Lord coming out to talk to them, the hour is you know, pastor, which hour they want to see. You said the hour is what? He said you don't get it. He said that the son of man should be glorified. When the Gentiles were pushing out to see Christ, there is a need. Hallelujah. For Christ to be glorified. Yes. The word in his glorification, his death, his burial, his resurrection, his ascension before ascension and his final ascension. My don't be confused. I say ascension before ascension. We can come to it. Hallelujah. You know when Jesus resurrected, amen. Some of the sisters and brother wanted to touch me. Yes. He said, "No, you can't touch me. For I have not ascended to your father and my father. to your God and my God. The prophet said he actually went. Amen. To submit the trophy. Then he came back and started appearing. I said, "Thomas, you can touch me now." So there was an ascension before his final acts chapter one ascension. Hallelujah. That's right. Those were his glorification. Uh-huh. Oh, you took it away. You advertise us with the scripture, please. [Applause] Amen. That the son of man should be glorified. Yes. The next verse, watch it. Now verily verily I say unto you, Amen. Except a con of which fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much in holy land. The Greeks, the Gentiles will see Jesus after his death, burial and resurrection. And this was necessary. You know why? If he did not die, Jesus and his ministry finishes. Amen. But if he dies and he resurrects, he will be able to replicate himself in many body of blood. How will he release you? How will he release me? The prophet says he went with you and I in his womb to the cross. Amen. That was why Gethsemane was his labor room. Brother said while he was in the labor room of he's got to make just one decision. And this decision is hanging. Yes. On call things. Amen. He said the sins of the past. Yes. The sins of the present. The sins of the future. Amen. Did you hear me? The sins of the past. The sins of the present. The sins of the future. Their forgiveness, their erasure, depends on that decision. Hallelujah. Amen. Because people couldn't enter into the holiest of the holies. Yes. As great as they were, when they died in the Old Testament. Yes. They couldn't go to the presence of God. Yes. They were only kept in the paradise that was. That's right. In the same prison house. Yes. But the VIP section. Because they are not common prisoners. Yes. Satan up to that time owes the keys of hell and death. Yes. That's right. No matter how righteous you were, you got under the lock and key. That's right. The devil when you die. Yes. Amen. Wonderful. Hallelujah. Satan takes death as his property and as many as were killed by his property becomes his property. Yes. But the likes of Abraham and then God said you can hold them but you can't hold them in the common prison house. That is why sections were created. And the place of torment all kind of category. Yes. Amen. But all of them under the lock and key of the devil. That's right. So if Christ never died and paid the price and resurrected, they cannot be free. Amen. Amen. Because it is the death of Christ, the payment of the sacrifice of Christ that will atone perfectly for the sins of the past. It will atone for the present and it will atone for the future. Yes, sir. There must be an advanced atonement for you and I. Amen. Not to encourage us and say, but to show us what God has done so that in all situations, Amen. we can find peace. [Music] [Applause] So when he gets he said knock by will let thy will be done. Christ became fully dilated for delivery. And from that moment he was moved from Gethsemane to Calvary the delivery room. Hallelujah. Are you still joining with me? When he came to the delivery room, the delivery turned out not to be natural. It was cesarian. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So before you can come forth, Christ must be put under necessia. And it could not go under necessia until he declared it is finished. Amen. Amen. Amen. He is the one to determine when the surgeon will do his job. Amen. He is the one to determine when he's ready to bring forth. Amen. When he said it is finished, yielded her. He went into anastasia. Amen. Hallelujah. And while he was there, thank you Jesus. The devil was trying to work your deliverance. Instead, he anointed the soldiers to take a hammer. They wanted to do autoetic surgery. Very what was needed was a ceerian surgery. Amen. They carried the armor. Let me tell you, the carrying of the armor was intentional. Yes. Yes. Satan knew the word of the Lord that not one bone of his body will be broken. But he will always attempt to challenge the word thinking that that has been spoken several years ago and it must have expired. But I tell you this morning, God's word does not expire. God's word can never fail. Hold on to it as a lifeline. Abraham said when God speaks he puts a power behind it. When that word is challenged the power wakes up the God and it starts to defend only believe. All things are possible. Once they carry the hammer they broke the legs of the first because there was no promise against that. Amen. If you start from the left, Jesus was in the middle. So he should be the next, isn't it? If you start from the right, Jesus was in the middle. So it should be the next. How come they bypass Jesus? The moment he carried the hammer, the word came alive. Not one bone could be broken. Yes. Even the sleeping Jesus, the dead Jesus was more powerful than the active Satan. Hallelujah. One day was sleeping in the boat. Do you remember that? 100% man. 100% God. Amen. As a man, he was sleeping in the boat and Satan said, "There I got him." before he got up. I will sing this boat. Amen. And Satan was working hard and the sleeping Jesus was just sleeping. He slept so deep until he took the disciples to come and wake Jesus. You got to wake him Sunday because persecution is coming. Pressure is coming. Hallelujah. Is coming. You will be working one more time. Hallelujah. And they went to meet him master fear not that we perish and they will think they are sounding spiritual. It's an insult to the ability of God. Yes. To think a boat where Jesus was in whe could be sunk. It's an insult. That was when Jesus got up he never commanded them. So he must have said for you guys this is your level. I will be here and the boat will sink. I think better. Behold what manner of man is it? Then they went to the bra of the cal please be still and all the of the devil went down the sleeping Jesus more powerful than the active Satan. Now the dead Jesus is even more powerful than the living Satan. They carried me. They went for the first bypass Jesus. Came to the second. They said now with full force we shall break this one. And the Lord say you dumb. Amen. Hallelujah. Drop the hammer. Yes. We are not doing traumatic automatic surgery. What we doing is a delivery. Get your tools right. Yes. Drop the hammer. Beep the spear. Yes. hit the middle point, the surgical needle. Hallelujah. And he went for the side. And for you to know, it was a delivery. Blood and water came out. And what came out after you? You except a con of wheat. One seed was killed and buried. It brings forth many. Hallelujah. Whereas it was one Jesus, from Calvary, many Jesuses came out. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] And when he said, "It is finished." The veil of the temple. Yes. We're closing that rent. Amen. Intol. In other words, the veil that separated the holiest of the holies. Where the light of God Shaka glory dwells where the manner that cannot gain where the cherubims mounted God was broken loose. Yes. In other words, the path to the tree of life. Amen. The path to the fullness of the word, the spiritual food in due season, the way of eternal life, was open. The path to revelation was open. This is what did for you and I. [Applause] Hallelujah. Brother Brown said, "I can see the cherubims look at themselves." Amen. No job again. The man who told us to block has opened it inside. I can hear God respond back. New job now. [Music] New job now. New job now. Before now I told you to chase them away with that sword. Yes. But you now take that same sword. to chase them back inside. Are you with me, brother? That is why in every service the terms must be here. Brother said, "You may not see them, but you can feel their influence. What are they doing? Giving you a charge, making you say amen, making you stand up, making you rejoice, making you work to the Lord." Why? It is the sword of God bringing you back to the tree of life to enjoy every blessing that God has for you. This is the reason in this last days. Hallelujah. The last cherubim. Oh yes. Hallelujah. There were four cherubims. There were mountains guard around the throne of God. You remember that? Amen. One has got the face of a lion. Uh-huh. One has got the face of an ox. One has got the face of a man and the other the face of an eagle. And these are the four that are closest to the throne. After them comes the 24 elders. After the 24 elders comes the group of John. That's what the Bible said. John as a layer. to see the throne. He has to meet the 24 elders. Then after the 24 elders, the four cherubims, they were the closest to the throne. They have eyes in front and at the back. The prophet said it shows their level of spiritual intelligence. [Applause] And these four cherubims ran through the seven church ages. Hallelujah. You will see what Easter did for you. The last of the Jerobans is the one with the face over. Amen. When this remain was to be made manifest on the earth. Sacrileg. No sir. But the truth when the path to the tree of life was to be made manifest on the earth. When the hidden man was to be brought out from under the cover of the wings of the cherub. Amen. Which is the totality of the word. Yes. Revealed. Yes. God told the last cherub. Amen. Go to the mountain. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Anyone to the mountain shall be no not sunset now shall be no the same mountain where he saw that squirrel his enemy that afflicted him every seven years dead. Amen. Amen. The squirrel was on this side of the walkway. Then he was told to go on this other side of the walkway. Amen. right to the top of the mountain. Amen. And in there, you see this message came with the Lord of Cost to you and I. I believe God could have spoken things in the comfort of the prophets to him. But even for a 5 minute encounter, it will say leave your house, travel some and go stay on a mountain and I will come to you. Amen. If the prophet is thirsty and he needed water, do you know he has to come down about 2,000 ft off the mountain to drink water and then go back again if God has not attended to him and he just must wait there. And it's not an easy climb. My God. I've done it before twice or Yeah. twice now. Once with my wife, once alone. And the old man who was taking us up there to the mountain, he got a knapsack and packed a lot of water and Coca-Cola. And I said, "What is this man for?" Uh, I said, "Pastor, you will know as we go. Who is this?" I said, "We don't need this much." She said, "Pastor, calm down." If you have the generation book, when you open it in the middle, that's what our Peterson say. You kind see whether we did it or not. Tell you what, between me and my wife, we finish the whole lap sack before we go to the mountain. It's a desert place. When you clitude, it feels like your body's disintegrating. Everything dry. So the old man in his wisdom and me by ignorance with a fellowship. This was what our prophet went through. Yes. But I thank God was for a just [Applause] he was there praying and praying and praying just waiting upon the Lord and all of a sudden he felt something in his eyes. When he opened his eyes, what was it? It was a glistening saw. Then he heard a voice the king saw. Then he said a king sword. A king kn a man with a sword. The boys came back. Not a king. Because we are suggesting one out of many. Yes. There is only one king. Hallelujah. The king of that is the king of the king of kings himself. Hallelujah. Oh my. I was fellowshipping around that and the sword went by. Yes. But the prophet said when he had that sword, he looked like his palm was measured. Hallelujah. The hungry. That's for another. Somebody's p was measured to fit the handle. Hallelujah. Somebody receive grace to bring the perfection of understanding, the totality of revelation of the message of the hour. Hallelujah. The king's sword is the word of the Lord. Why will God night brother with the sword right around the opening of the word is to show to us on earth what happened in the book of Matthew. What happened on that day? What happened in the book of Mark that on earth the veil has truly been rented. The path to the tree of life has been made open again. So God sent his charm to do what? With the S to chase us back. This is the reason for the prophet message. He has chased us back. And that was why he brought us spiritual food induces. Are we feeding daily on those blessings? It will work upon the atoms of our body and change us from glory to glory. From who we are to who we should be. A masterpiece of God that will give you evidence that indeed Christ is not dead but is alive. The veil of the temple have been rented because he said it is finished. God bless you. Hallelujah. Thank you. Amen. That's right. Lord, for the message of the hour. Amen. Can musicians please come forward. Amen. Hallelujah. What am I doing here? Praise be to God. Can you see why Satan for the visa? Can you see why he was trying to block the visa? He was trying to block somebody's liberty. Because the message we heard today is a message of ley. a message of resurrection. God bless you my precious pastor. May strengthen you for the rest of the service. Hallelujah. Praise be to God. I pray brother and sister that today will be the a new beginning for many of you. Those who are weak, those who are struggling, those who who feel defeated, may the word strengthen you. May the Lord strengthen himself. Listen to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We're going to pray for a couple of hours and then we're going to come back to this afternoon service at 4:00. Amen. If some of you are not coming back this afternoon, please come back. We all need each other. We need your heat. We need your Amen. You need the word of God. If you are deciding to go home, maybe there's nothing to do at home. You just want to go home. No, just don't go home. Just come back to the sir. What's more important than the world? Brother Adrian, more important than the world. Let's sing a chorus before our precious Pastor Bright. Pastor Bright, are you here? I heard your wife saying, "Amen." Where is Pastor Bride? There he is. There he is. We'll sing a chorus twice and then we will ask our precious pastor bride to close this section of the meeting in prayer. Let us stand and sing. He's a mighty warrior. Great in battle. Oh is his name. Praise be to God. said he's a mighty [Applause] [Music] [Applause] war. He's a mighty warrior. Mighty [Music] war Jehovah is Jehovah is [Music] Jehovah.
