========================================

Amen. To worship him and give him praise. Amen. So I'd like to welcome every one of you in the house of the Lord. Amen. Our visitors especially. Amen. Brother Nolan and Sister Bunnies are no strangers to us. Amen. You know, Brother Nolan, you take children for excursion, right? So you must tell them you brought them to excursion to show them where you grew up, &gt;&gt; in which church you grew up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Nolan is a son of this ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lovely brother. Amen. Always a pleasant spirit. Amen. And he's serving the Lord out there ever since he got married. But you know, we got a custom that with the girls follow the guys. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. But Nolan got away. But we're happy to see him here this morning. Amen. Together with his family. And it's good to see. Amen. People you grew up with still serving the Lord in the message and now imparting it on to the next generation. Amen. Looking at Sister Esther there, I was reminded that when Sister Bernice was that age, she was also singing. Amen. So we you know what the Lord told about Abraham. I know him that he will raise his children right. He will teach them the ways of the Lord. We're thankful. Amen. That they in fellowship with us this morning. We love them. We appreciate them. Amen. Also, Amen. I keep forgetting our sister's name. Is it uh add a line? What you said? &gt;&gt; Am I saying it right? &gt;&gt; All right. Go. Let's welcome her as well. Give her a hand. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. I pray you'll be blessed in the house of the Lord. Let's read our scripture then you can get seated. Amen. So last week we were looking at that Jesus was the door and we needed a key to open the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we found that revelation is the key to open the door to Jesus. &gt;&gt; And we found that this door wasn't just an ordinary door in Revelation 10:7. It was a door to marriage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what the Elisa ministry came to unite us with Christ. Amen. So we just want to bless his name. Let's turn to John chapter 14. Maybe we'll read verse 20 there and then you can be seated. Amen. Praise the Lord. So the Lord Jesus now is fixing to leave and he's giving a word of comfort to the people to his disciples. Amen. If we want to get context, let's read from verse 16 and we'll see what our Lord is saying here. He says, "I will pray the father. He will give you another comforter." So I am one door. Jesus is the door. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to open up another door to you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you another comforter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he may abide with you forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not &gt;&gt; neither knoweth him. So this comforter that's coming is not an ordinary message for the outside world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's saying the world cannot receive him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Neither because it seeth him not. So which means that we got to have a spiritual eye to see him &gt;&gt; because they won't see him but we'll see him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Neither knoweth him, but you know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be where? &gt;&gt; In you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. &gt;&gt; Where is he? &gt;&gt; He is in you. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet a little while, this is the verse I want to get to now from 19:20. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me because I live you shall live also. Now main verse at that day this day &gt;&gt; after seven church ages after denominational ages have run out. At that day you shall know that I am in my father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You in me &gt;&gt; and I in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Meaning the complete mystery of God would be finished. &gt;&gt; And the complete marriage would have taken place &gt;&gt; because that is an intertwined between God and man. &gt;&gt; It says I am in my father, you in me, and I in you. The Lord a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I just want to uh tie this quickly because sometimes we preach things and some people want to see the scriptural evidence of it. So if you go to Revelation 22 and verse 17, I was trying to show you this and I was speaking about it even on Wednesday when 17 Amen. where when the Lord here is writing in the book he says the spirit and the bride say come and I was trying to show you that it's not a spirit somewhere else and the bride somewhere else and two voices. The spirit is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; When the when the Bible is saying and the spirit and the bride say come, &gt;&gt; the spirit at that time will be in the bride. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to give you the scripture. We just read it. So he's saying the spirit and the bride are saying come. Not two different voices, but the spirit is in the bride. Tabernacle in the bride. &gt;&gt; If you go back to St. John 14 and verse 17, same verse 17, you'll see what our Lord Jesus is saying there. We just read it now. Amen. In verse 17, he's saying, "Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but you know him, for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm bringing there 14:17 and Revelation 22:17 to show you it's not two different voices on the earth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And for the first time &gt;&gt; since the fall, &gt;&gt; God can come down in the cool of the day and he don't have to be looking for his son and his daughter. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because every evening in the in the cool of the day, the Lord would come down in the garden of Eden and he would have fellowship with his sons and his daughters. &gt;&gt; They would not Amen. would not run away or not ive &gt;&gt; because they were not in a fallen condition. Now we find in Revelation 22:17, for the first time, man is fully restored on the earth and he can now say to the father, "Come." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, amen. Getting to our morning topic this morning. I want to tell you that there are some things that God had designed in his thoughts and his attributes that can be only expressed through you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen. God destined it that way. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was for ordained from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't force God to do things that were meant for you and I to do. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; What God wanted to do through Jesus Christ, he has fully done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, we still when God is now working through his bride, he wants to have the preeminence through his bride. We want God to come and do it. But that was was not what was in the back part of God's mind. &gt;&gt; So we can't force God to do things that was meant for you and I to do. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that was meant to do that God wanted to do, he did it through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; For his part, &gt;&gt; for the male part, &gt;&gt; but when it comes to the female part, there's an expression, a feminine expression that God wants to do through you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when the bridegroom cometh, he opens the door in Matthew 25:10. If you put it up there, you'll see we are living in a time and season where we can't call ourselves wise virgins. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't let me shock your theology again. We've been through this for the year. We're speaking about the opening of dimensional doors this year. &gt;&gt; What did he do here? And while the bride went to buy, the bridegroom came and that they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not going to the marriage after the rapture. The marriage takes place here on earth now. &gt;&gt; How many of you know that? &gt;&gt; We are going to the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; So which means the wise virgins Jesus has opened the door to them to a marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they have gone in with him for the marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll bring a further clarity to that. If you believe you're a wise virgin carrying oil in Leos here, then you're still in the second court. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because even the wise virgin said, "We can't give you some of this oil less we run out." &gt;&gt; They knew if they stayed outside of the door, that oil was eventually going to run out. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so if you take the tabernacles and the three courts, on the outside they had natural light. &gt;&gt; On the inner court they had candlestick light, seven church age light. &gt;&gt; But in the holiest of holies &gt;&gt; is where the bride is now shutting with God where you don't need candle light, you don't need lamp light, but you got shakana glory light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if somebody asked you, are you wise virgin? No. How can you be a virgin and be married? Amen. &gt;&gt; Something wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're married to the Lord Jesus Christ and you claiming to be a wise virgin walking with oil in your lamp. There's something wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Which means now remember the marriage was typed out in the Eastern culture. &gt;&gt; Now when somebody was married, &gt;&gt; the marriage was only regarded as marriage truly married because after the vows were taken There was a tent &gt;&gt; where the bride and the groom had to go into &gt;&gt; and consummate the marriage &gt;&gt; before the marriage feast. &gt;&gt; Come on. We mustn't get it confused with our western way of doing things. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were testing two things. &gt;&gt; Whether she would be submissive and give herself to her husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they were also testing for a virgin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if she was found not to be a virgin, then marriage was announced. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the woman has put away. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; We can't be reading the Bible with our western weddings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have honeymoon after the wedding uh celebration after eating. Praise the Lord. Here they had honeymoon first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they want to test if this is a royal woman. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have progressed in time. We can't be calling ourselves wise virgins. We were the wise virgins. Just like our one time we were the church. &gt;&gt; But in the first year, brother Brandham changes our position from church and he says, "I no longer call you church, but I call you bride." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So as bride, you can still be a virgin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As bride because you come in now, they make [Music] &gt;&gt; they bring you down to the altar &gt;&gt; to be married to the Lord Jesus Christ. But there after you say your vows, what do they say? I now present you husband and &gt;&gt; wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your title change immediately from bride to wife. &gt;&gt; Because as bride you are at low inheritance. As bride, you don't have the name yet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Only as wife, you take on the name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't want to be staying on this too long. You know, we've been through this. Amen. Through the months now, but I just want to hit the highlights of this. When they when you are leaving there, you are leaving as Mr. and Mrs. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you can't say that you are now the bride of Christ. You are now the wife. You are the married wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we took you through the quotes and he showed you why Adam was given a wife is to reproduce his own life. &gt;&gt; He says, "Every man is given a bride to reproduce himself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam was given a wife to reproduce himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So woman who doesn't want to go into a husband and bring forth his seed is not in oneness with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So here you can find Jesus opening up the door to the marriage and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So there's a door open to the bride which we have come into. Amen. We have come into this door now. So like I'm saying there are some things that God wants to do through the bride. So when the bridegroom cometh, he opens the door. What is he doing? Revealing himself. That's what Revelation 10:7 is all about. He is revealing himself when the mystery of God is being revealed. &gt;&gt; The opening of the door is the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it doing? Opening is revealing Christ in bright form. Now, Christ in white form, Christ in sons and daughters. So, opening is equal to revealing. &gt;&gt; When is this door being opened? At the opening of the seventh seal. Now, brother Brandham says that if I am fixing to do anything, I know better than to speak it out aloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says because Satan will try and cut me off at every corner from me achieving what I need to achieve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Distract me that the prophet is now having a 10th vision and he's speaking it out aloud everywhere. He's speaking it out aloud. He speaks about a brown bear. He's speaking it out aloud. &gt;&gt; I wonder when to cut it off. &gt;&gt; But in the seventh seal, he tells us, "If I'm fixing to do anything, I rather not speak it." &gt;&gt; Now, you know why the seventh seal is in silence? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there are certain things that God is going to do &gt;&gt; that Satan can't interfere with. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; But it's only the the participants that will know. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; What's happening? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we know that the door opens to a kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus is saying, "Seek you first the kingdom," we know that you need a key. And we know that the key is revelation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when where we we normally advise the young people, seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. But if you don't know what the key is to unlock the kingdom, how you going to open it up? So the key is revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The key is understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you start to unlock the blessings of God for your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now we know that this kingdom that we are in has no geographical borders. It's a spiritual kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every kingdom has a king and our king is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now we find here I want to take maybe the type of uh Esther in the Bible. Amen. The song you sang this morning, sister Bernice, was very apt and appropriate for this morning message. Amen. Because there are certain things that he can only do through the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now I want to ask you if you're looking at the book of Esther when the king had displayed his entire glory of the kingdom and everything. Amen. There was one thing he was not satisfied with showing his wealth, his houses and everything else. His full glory was going to be revealed through his wife. Yes. &gt;&gt; He wasn't satisfied when he displayed the entire wealth of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; And it looked like even they were not impressed. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then what more can I do to impress them?" &gt;&gt; I I'll show them my queen. &gt;&gt; But vastly refused to come. &gt;&gt; I don't have time to get into now, but he says, "Lu the receiver refused the seat &gt;&gt; of Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; Wesley refused to receive the seed of Christ. &gt;&gt; The the Pentecostals refused to receive the seed of Christ. &gt;&gt; But after William Brandon came as Revelation 10:7 &gt;&gt; and Malachi 4:5 and 6, there was now a woman that he found at the well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A Rebecca, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; that he found at the well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And she was drawing water. &gt;&gt; Amen. She had justification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She was making a sacrifice to feed the camels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sanctification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he had come to bring her into union with Isaac. You know the story. But we are focusing now on Esther. If you're looking at Esther, you will know that Vast is put away. And they have they now the seven chamberlins which are typing the seven church age messengers are now saying go and find a new wife. This one won't reproduce your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go find a new wife. Then we find there's a ministry. Amen. On the scene there &gt;&gt; you know that the king's chamber and one of them is a &gt;&gt; h e g a i. There's a ministry to prepare you for marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a ministry to bring you as queen. If we want to hit the highlights, we can we can look at it very quickly. Amen. If you just want to see it. Praise the Lord. Let's go to Esther chapter 2. Esther chapter 2 and verse 8. It says, "And so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, when many maidens were gathered together unto Shusha and the palace to the custody custody of Agai, that Esther was brought unto the king's house to the custody of Agai, keeper of the women." &gt;&gt; Amen. You can read further. I want to get down to verse 15. Now when Es when the now all the women were presented now when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abiel uncle of Moriah Amen I don't want to read the whole thing but you can see she required nothing but what Agai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the woman appointed. So she didn't want anything else but what this keeper of the house had given her &gt;&gt; to go into the presence of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all of them that looked upon her. So Esther was taken into kingus into his house royal in the 10th month which is the 10th month in the seventh year. So under 10th seven it's a marriage. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God being revealed is a marriage. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the king loved Esther above all women and she obtained favor grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins. Why some want to be virgins? You can be virgin. But now she's wife. &gt;&gt; How many of you can see this? &gt;&gt; Esther now becomes wife. She obtains favor more than all the virgins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So that they he sent a royal crown upon her head and made a queen instead of vasti. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now she is queen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there's a ministry to bring you into union with Christ where you can be regarded the queen. &gt;&gt; You can walk around the house. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You have royal accommodation. &gt;&gt; You have royal food. &gt;&gt; You have luxury living. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that what we want? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want to show you a ministry was only a part way. That's why we're speaking about two doors were open to Esther. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Two ministries were open to Esther. &gt;&gt; One under AI to bring her to the marriage. But there must be a further ministry. &gt;&gt; You would know that she didn't have the kingdom. Even though she was the wife because when she finally comes into the king's presence, he says, "What is it, Esther, that you want &gt;&gt; even to have the kingdom? I'll give it to you." &gt;&gt; Now, can I give you what you already have? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which means she didn't fulfill a duty as a wife yet. &gt;&gt; Where the king could say half of mine is yours. &gt;&gt; Now remember men are easily hurt. &gt;&gt; The woman didn't want to come to him. &gt;&gt; She didn't want to have his child. &gt;&gt; So he was looking in the background whether this woman &gt;&gt; will give myself away. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I give myself away. You see, you can be in the king's palace. You can be partaking of the royal blessings, &gt;&gt; but you're not wife to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have board and lodge in the king's palace. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; You can even have a queen-sized bed, maybe a kingsiz bed. And let me put it very bluntly and I I pray you get what I mean. You can be sleeping in the palace but not sleeping with the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We find here now that the prophet Modiah is not happy with Esther just being queen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not happy with her just being queen. &gt;&gt; Right now, up until this point of the story, she's queen for her own benefit. &gt;&gt; We were not called into the kingdom for our own benefit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; There are certain things that he kind of can only do through you and I. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But as long as we stay outside of his presence, &gt;&gt; here she is standing like queen, a virgin queen. I'm the queen. I got chosen above all women. But the king is in his throne room and she's disconnected from him. &gt;&gt; She even says she includes herself with the other people. But she didn't realize what her position is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She says anyone who comes into the presence of the king will be killed. She didn't realize she was a married wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? All these years she thinks she's a virgin with oil and a lamp. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; She needs to change her mentality. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a ministry that's got to change her mentality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember what we told you about how God works. Revelation is coming through his prophet. &gt;&gt; The key of revelation, you can't get it on your own. &gt;&gt; You've got to get it through a prophetic gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So she goes on living and you know how Ammon comes and he tries to he now he writes a law that all Jews will be killed &gt;&gt; on a certain certain date. Now time is drawing near. Seven church changes have passed. The fourth house is on the earth. All hell is let loose upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Time is drawing night. The bride needs to get out of the way. But she is just living there disconnected from the king. I pray you're reading between the lines what I'm trying to tell you. &gt;&gt; Saying I'm in the message, &gt;&gt; saying I'm the bride. &gt;&gt; Saying I'm a virgin. &gt;&gt; Saying I'm a wife. But you have no relationship with the king. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will find that her words that whoever goes into the presence of the king will be killed is a non-truth. &gt;&gt; She is believing that if I go into the presence of the king, I'll be killed. But when she finally gets into the presence, she is proved wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Which means she could have gone earlier. Yeah, &gt;&gt; she was depriving herself of privileges. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she didn't want to go in &gt;&gt; because of a false word that was preached to her. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But she looks like she's in the message. &gt;&gt; She's It was the first ministry that brought her in. &gt;&gt; She's queen. What more could you want? I want more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't want just the title. &gt;&gt; I want more. &gt;&gt; And in fact, I must have more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of you are satisfied with what you have right now? &gt;&gt; How many of you want more? &gt;&gt; Then amen. God is opening to us now that he wants to give us more, but you can't receive more in the current condition you are in or where you are currently positioned. &gt;&gt; Who must change their position in order for Esther to get more? Must the king come out of where he is or must you get into where he is? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just want to be where you are. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; You can't call the king to where you are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You've got to lower your pride. &gt;&gt; You've got to lower all your ambitions. &gt;&gt; And you've got to get into the presence of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, wonderful. Thank you. So we are finding here some like identification being in the kingdom is not good enough. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh &gt;&gt; being in the kingdom is not good enough. No some have I a certain identification. I got justification. Do you know justification? You mean you in the kingdom? &gt;&gt; Hey that's a work of the Holy Ghost. So justification means you you're in the kingdom but you haven't gone the full way. To have sanctification means you're part of the kingdom. I told you last week all of these people will be saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When John sees them, John is asked who are who are these? You couldn't number them. They were without number. &gt;&gt; And the voice the angel says these are they that have come through great tribulation. &gt;&gt; So they will not lose their salvation. They were saved under justification, saved under sanctification, saved under restoration of the gifts. But in this time and season, if you miss the shout, &gt;&gt; you will miss salvation. &gt;&gt; There's not an alternate door like an escape hatch. If I miss the shout in the rapture, I'm going in the secret door. I'll go in the tribulation. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you miss your part of the rapture, which is the shout, you will miss the physical translation of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. But they to stay outside the court of the Lord's knocking, but they won't open. Christ has opened the door to the marriage, pull the bride out. He changed the title from church to bride into a married ceremony because he wants to reproduce his life in us like no other age before. &gt;&gt; Amen. So every door has a key. And when he opened the door, we know he pulled the bride in through revelation, right? The foolish virgins can't come in. He says the door was closed to her because she don't have revelation of this end time message. &gt;&gt; That's why she can't come to the marriage. She don't have revelation. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Thank God for revelation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my key. &gt;&gt; To unlock Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now there's another key if you go to Revelation 3:7 there. Hallelujah. Let's look at this key very quickly. And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia, right? You remember Philadelphia is a leap over age now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We've been speaking on the Philadelphia corridor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All of these things. You remember brother Brandon says it's a lapover age. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Into the latest church age. How many of you remember that? Amen. &gt;&gt; These things say he that is holy, he that is true, he that had the key of David. &gt;&gt; Now what is this key? &gt;&gt; He that openeth and no man shut it and shut and no man openeth. Now what kind of a key is this? It sounds like a master key. &gt;&gt; It sounds like a key to unlock potentials. &gt;&gt; It sounds like a key to the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Is Jesus called the son of David? Then what is this key that they're talking about? Jesus has the key. How many of you are reading this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These things say he which is holy. Who is that? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Is that Jesus? &gt;&gt; He that is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the one that is holy and true has the key of David. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But does he really have it? In what form does he have it is what I'm trying to ask you. Let's go. Amen. If you can put up that first quote there. So let's read Isaiah 22:22 before you put up the quote. So let's look at the key of David. Right. &gt;&gt; I don't if you're interested to see what the key of David is. Amen. &gt;&gt; So here in Isaiah 22:22 it says, "And the key of the house of David will I lay upon is." &gt;&gt; So where's the key? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; Why not answering me? Don't want to go 1:00. And the key of the house of David while I lay upon is &gt;&gt; shoulder. So he shall open &gt;&gt; and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open. Is that just what we read in Revelation there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this key looks like an important key to have. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember the key of David. Why David? Remember David did something very unusual. He was king. But he went into the priest tabernacle there and he ate of the mana. Something a king was not supposed to do. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember that King David did that. &gt;&gt; Because what was he trying to type? He was trying to type Melzdc was both king and priest. &gt;&gt; So he did it for a reason. If we go to that first quote there, you'll see what the prophet of God is saying. Amen. Okay. So, I don't want to get this. I want to get Did I give you this first? Praise the Lord. Let me see what I gave you first. Amen. The first quote I gave you was about the key of David. Amen. Maybe you put it in a different order. He says, "He that hath the key of David." This is what we want to see now. What is the prophet telling us this? What is he telling us about the key of David? How many if you want to know? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says, "He that had the key of David," this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding verse, he that is true, Christ, the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization. Praise the Lord. Here it is. Moses was a prophet of God. But Jesus, like unto Moses, was the prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I'm reading this quote from my message that I gave to you. It's the first quote I sent to you. So, if you can find it quickly, I don't want the people to miss this. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, I'm going to read now and I want you to get what the prophet is saying this T is cuz it's very important to understand it. You don't if you're going to your car and you can't find your your house key or your car key. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're walking around going looking everywhere for the key only to finally realize the key is in your pocket. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I'm trying to convey to you now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet is saying certain things &gt;&gt; and we are missing it in the message. &gt;&gt; He that had the key of David. This beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phrase. He that is true. Christ the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization. Here it is. Moses was a prophet of God. But Jesus, like unto Moses, was the prophet of God. &gt;&gt; David, a man after God's own heart, was king of Israel. But Jesus is greater David, king of kings, lord of lords, God, very God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, David was born of the tribe of Judah, out of whom no priest came. Yet he ate of the shorebread received reserved for priest. He was the great warrior overcoming the enemy, establishing the people as king. He sat on the throne. He was a prophet. He was a wonderful type of Christ. &gt;&gt; So, he's showing you that David was typing prophet, priest, and king. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, it says in Isaiah 22:22, "And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder, so he shall open and none shall shut, and he shall shut, and none shall open." So wait, does it look like God is doing this? &gt;&gt; Because he's saying, "He shall open, he shall shut." [Music] &gt;&gt; The spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What the key of David signified at that time was a mere shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands. It has to do with our Lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage. But what does the key signify? The answer lies in the position of the key. It's not in his hand. &gt;&gt; It's not worn around his neck. It's not placed in the hands of other men. Or the verse could not be saying he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shut and no man has a right but Jesus himself. Isn't that right? But where is the key? It's on his shoulders. &gt;&gt; Now he's going to show you something. But what does the shoulder have to do with it? Read Isaiah 9:6. And the government shall be upon his shoulder. [Music] &gt;&gt; But what does this mean? The answer is this. The phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony from the east. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; When the bride has been committed to the groom, she takes off a veil and places it over the groom's shoulder, signifying that not only is she under his dominion, that she has transferred her rights to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. That he is the head. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then if he is the head, it means he's not the shoulder. &gt;&gt; Shoulder is part of the somebody say &gt;&gt; body. &gt;&gt; So where's the key? &gt;&gt; It's in the body. &gt;&gt; So if Jesus himself is the only one that can lock and unlock &gt;&gt; and the key is in the body, &gt;&gt; through whom must he lock and unlock? Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You see why I say there are certain things locked up in his mind that only you and I can fulfill if we submit to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we want him to do everything but he wants to do it through us. &gt;&gt; Right. He is the head but also that he bears the responsibility and the care that he and he alone. No one else, no other man, no other power has any right or responsibility. I don't expect another man to be buying groceries for my wife. &gt;&gt; I don't expect another man to be buying a dress for my wife. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; He takes full responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus Christ takes full responsibility for each and every one of us personally. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this room seated right here, Jesus Christ has a personal responsibility over your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Meaning from your breath to your well-being to your health to your job to your school to every facet of your life. Jesus takes clinical responsibility for it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Which means if we realize that we can go to him and make a claim, &gt;&gt; you are responsible for me. Why am I starving? You are responsible for me. Why don't I have clothes? You are responsible for me. Why don't I have a place to stay? &gt;&gt; But you can only make a claim if you recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; And who has responsibility over you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Joshua, do you expect us to Josephine to God and work &gt;&gt; right now &gt;&gt; and buy our own clothes and our own food? No, brother Joshua, sister Vanessa has taken personal responsibility over sister Josephine. &gt;&gt; So anything sister Josephine needs &gt;&gt; must she go ask brother Jeff &gt;&gt; the uncle &gt;&gt; the rich uncle? No, she must go to mom and dad. &gt;&gt; Who did Caleb's daughter go to? Yes. &gt;&gt; After he got his inheritance, &gt;&gt; came to Caleb, &gt;&gt; came to her father and says, "Father, I have need of the spring." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Such as I have, give I unto thee. You want to the upper spring, but also take the lower spring." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to realize who you are under headship. &gt;&gt; You see why is so important? because you can make a claim upon your head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just continue reading and finishing this quote. So, he has person. So, anything you need in this life, Jesus Christ takes personal responsibility over you. &gt;&gt; You need a husband, who you need to ask? &gt;&gt; Your head. &gt;&gt; You need to ask Jesus. &gt;&gt; Look, unmarried people, your head is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you need a wife, you need a husband, you need to ask the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is your head. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Seek the Lord in these things. Praise the Lord. Amen. And that beloved is the key of David. God being sovereign. He for you by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride. &gt;&gt; Watch is going to detail it now. He chose her. She did not choose him. &gt;&gt; He called her. She did not come on her own. He died for her. He washed her in his own blood. He paid the price for her. She belongs to him and to him alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's only committed to him and accepts the obligation. He is her head for Christ is the head of the church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord. Do you know what that word Lord means? Maybe after this the woman will call the husband Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord because maybe we don't know what the Lord mean word Lord means. The word Lord means owner. &gt;&gt; You are my owner. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Now, who's renting here? &gt;&gt; What's your the man that owns a building called? &gt;&gt; Landlord. You mean he owns that land? See, I make it easy for the sisters to come call you Lord. Where was the woman taken out of? So who is the owner? &gt;&gt; So when you come to your husband and say Lord all you are saying is owner. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb expect a Lord there. &gt;&gt; Lord Caleb. Praise the Lord. Amen. Now let's let's jump very quickly to the story of Esther again and I'm going to close now. Amen. We'll hit the highlight of Esther and then we'll close. Is anybody not happy with that arrangement? Okay. We find in the book of Esther very quickly we showed you there was a ministry of Agai who only brought her a certain stage of the journey. &gt;&gt; He brought her into the marriage &gt;&gt; but then he went off the scene. Here in the book of Esther chapter 4, we find there's another ministry comes in on the scene which is a type of the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says in Esther chapter 4, we can read maybe just from verse five starts in five, right? Then God called Esther. Then called Esther for Ach. &gt;&gt; Yeah. A techch is a very important ministry. &gt;&gt; Techch is now taking word from Moriah &gt;&gt; and conveying it to Esther. &gt;&gt; He is the gobetween. &gt;&gt; Because right now Brandom is not on the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Modiah doesn't have access to Esther. &gt;&gt; So he's sending word via tech. &gt;&gt; The fivefold ministry is getting word from the prophet's message &gt;&gt; and bringing it out to you week after week. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? To position you. &gt;&gt; Watch what he does. Then called Amen Esther for one of the king's chamberlins whom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him commandment to Modi to know what it was and why it was. &gt;&gt; Amen. To know the mysteries. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What it was, why it was. &gt;&gt; That sounds like a mystery. &gt;&gt; So who's bringing it? The five-fold. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Where is he getting it from? And Ach went forth to Moriah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ask your pastor anything, he goes into the message. &gt;&gt; He goes to Moriah to find out what did Moriah say. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ach went forth to Mori unto the street of the city which was before the king's gate. And Mori told him of all that had happened to him and the sum of the money that Ammon had promised to pay the king's treasures for the Jews to destroy them. So like I said, time is running out. The date for all Jews to be annihilated is coming closer. &gt;&gt; Time is running out. The time for our body change is growing closer. The time for the Denny Christ is growing closer. We don't have much time. So at is on the scene now to speed up the process and bring the king in to bring Esther into where she's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he gave him copy of the writing. &gt;&gt; Yes. And the decree that was given to Shusha, didn't we see copies of the one world government, the one world religion? Didn't we see copies of it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have everything in place right now. &gt;&gt; Didn't Modiah tell us about these things? &gt;&gt; Show it to Esther. Declare it unto her. Charge her that she should go in unto the king. What is his ministry now? &gt;&gt; Get into shakana glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now is the time church not to stay outside. Yeah. Virgin with lamp. Get into the presence of the king. &gt;&gt; Get shut in with God. Come into shakana glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; What is his ministry? &gt;&gt; He's saying give word, give charge that she should go in unto the king. &gt;&gt; To make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And at came and told Esther the words of Moriah again five-fold ministry coming to tell you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you'll find there's a back and forth back and forth going. She sends a tech with another word. I don't want to read all of it. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's go down to verse 14. For thou allto together, for if thou allto together holdeth thy peace at this time, then shall enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place. &gt;&gt; I want you to know in God's mind, enlargement and deliverance is not supposed to come from another place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Enlargement and deliverance is supposed to come from you, Esther. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; But he's saying if you don't want to do your part, &gt;&gt; God will do it another way. That's right. &gt;&gt; But let's pray that the hack ministry works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it does work now. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; But thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed. And who knoweth whether thou art called to come into the kingdom. Kingdom needs a key. &gt;&gt; Key of David &gt;&gt; for such a time as this. &gt;&gt; This ministry shakes her. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This ministry startles her. &gt;&gt; Amen. to realize that even in the king's house she can die. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Can we say that &gt;&gt; you your father's house even you die in your kingdom because the decree is that all Jews must die. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now she says to Badim, "Return to Morai. Go gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan. Fast ye for me, neither heat nor drink three days, nor night or day. I also and my maidens will fast likewise. So will I go unto the king which is not according to the law. And if I perish, I perish. &gt;&gt; You see, we don't do Daniel fast. &gt;&gt; We are type of Esther. &gt;&gt; Denominations can't do this fast. &gt;&gt; They like to eat fruit and veg all day and they call it Daniel fast. They do it for 21 days &gt;&gt; eating fruit and veg. Esther's fast is no food. &gt;&gt; I know some of you saying, "I want to be like Daniel." This is too hard, right? Praise the Lord. Now, let's go to verse five, chapter 5 verse quickly. Now, what she said, remember what she said? Anyone who goes into the presence of the king will die. Esther chapter 5 verse two. And it was so when king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight. &gt;&gt; And the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter. &gt;&gt; This is who he was always waiting for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he was rejected by Vasti. This man's ego was a bit affected. &gt;&gt; So he was afraid to call for her just in case. She says she don't want to come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when he saw her there, he says, "This is whom I've been waiting for all my life." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How come you're married to me? How come you're my queen? &gt;&gt; But you're not with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he raises the royal scepter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To his queen &gt;&gt; and then he says unto her, "What will thou queen Esther? What is thy request? It shall ever even give unto thee after the kingdom. Praise the Lord." Now you know that uh Esther goes on a bit of a thing now where she tries to set up a meeting between Aean and the king. I'm not going to go into all of that. I want to get past this because most preachers stop here. This royal scepter is raised. Esther is before the king. Ammon is destroyed. But there's a further part to the story. &gt;&gt; We want to get to that part. Praise the Lord. Here in Esther chapter 7. Now, so after the banquet of wine, wine is typing revelation. After the banquet of revelation, right? If you read there in Esther chapter 7, you'll see there chapter verse two. And the king said unto again unto Esther, on the second day at the banquet of wine. Now, banquet of wine, I'm telling you spiritually speaking, is a banquet of revelation. That's right. &gt;&gt; Stimulation of revelation. What is thy petition, Queen Esther? And it shall be given grant to thee. What is thy request? It shall be performed even to ask the kingdom. Then the queen answered and said, "If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it pleased the king, let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request. For we are sold, I and my people to be destroyed, to be slain, to perish. For if if we had been sold for bondman and bond woman, I had held my tongue." Although the enemy could not count to veil the king's damage. Then the king Asus answered and said unto queen Esther the queen who is he and where is he that does presume in his heart to do so. &gt;&gt; So now she reveals the fourth house rider. She reveals Amon there. Right? If you go to verse 10 which is the last thing I want to show you the end of Amon and Aman is hanged in the gallows that he had prepared for Modiah. &gt;&gt; Right? I want to get to chapter eight because eight speaks of eternity. Now &gt;&gt; eight speaks of the bride age. &gt;&gt; Eight speaks of the headstone age. &gt;&gt; This is where things start to happen. Now her getting rid of Amon was good, but this is now for the deliverance of the Jews. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read from verse four again. Now the king held out the golden scepter towards Esther. So second time a scepter is held out to her. Esther rose and stood before the king and said, "If it pleased the king, I found favor in the sight and the things seem right before the king and I be pleasing in his eyes. Let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Ammon, the son of Ahmedabad, the Agatite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews, which were in the king's provinces." Right? For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come to my people? Or how can I endure to see destruction of my kindred? Then king said unto Esther the queen and Moriah the Jew, behold I have given Esther the house of Ammon him and they have upon the gallows be because he laid his hand upon the Jews. Now watch. You want me to write? Who does Esther want to write? &gt;&gt; Esther wants the king to write. Yes, &gt;&gt; everyone read that &gt;&gt; Esther is telling the king, rewrite the law. &gt;&gt; What is the king telling her now? Write you for the Jews. &gt;&gt; Which means, sister. Amen. What does it mean? &gt;&gt; Speak the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why you asking me? He said, "Write he also for the Jews has he like you &gt;&gt; in the king's name." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, there's no one more qualified to write in the king's name than the one who has the name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She is Mrs. Hahasser. &gt;&gt; So, in whose name are you writing &gt;&gt; in the king's name? But it's your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; And seal it with the king's ring. &gt;&gt; For the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed in the king's ring, may no man reverse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So what he is telling her, I as a king have decreed something and my words are irreversible. &gt;&gt; I have written it down &gt;&gt; as it is written. So let it be. But if you rewrite the laws, &gt;&gt; I'm giving you permission to rewrite the laws. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you permission to rewrite your life story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have the king's seal. &gt;&gt; You have his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The king's seal means his authority. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then where the king's called in the time, watch now, pay attention to the date. &gt;&gt; In the third month, that is the month of S on the 23rd day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right on the 23rd day, &gt;&gt; as it was written according that Moriah commanded unto the Jews, lieutenants, deputies, rulers of the provinces, which are from India, unto Ethiopia, and 127 provinces, and to every province according, this sounds like prophesying again, to every nation, tribes, and tongues. &gt;&gt; Rewrite it and prophesy it. &gt;&gt; Verse 10. And he wrote in King Audis's name and sealed it with the king's ring and sent letters by post on horseback and riders and mules, camels and young dramaties. What was going to happen? To sum it up, the day when these men were going to come to kill the Jews still stood. But they rewrote the law that on the 23rd day, &gt;&gt; we will fight for our rights. any man coming after us and the Jews, we have a right now to defend ourselves. &gt;&gt; I want to end with this quote here to show you &gt;&gt; regarding now. Remember what we said? The key is on the shoulder. &gt;&gt; How many of you remember that? &gt;&gt; The key is on the shoulder. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, let's read there after that last quote we read in the church ages. The spoken word is your original seed. 620318. Where is the government? Now remember the government shall be upon his shoulder. And we know the key is on the shoulder. Everyone is understanding that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is the government going to be upon the shoulders? His body. The government upon his shoulders. That's a part of the body. What is is it is earthly strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll let you digest that a bit. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. The strength of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one who spoke and said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His strength is not in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; The government upon his shoulder, that's his body. What is it? His earthly strength. Samson. The Philistines are upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Sam arose. His strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is another word for strength? Virtue. &gt;&gt; Where is all seven virtues? &gt;&gt; Tell me in his body. &gt;&gt; From faith to charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell me it's in his body. &gt;&gt; Tell me his earthly strength is in his body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's earthly strength, his word made flesh in his body here on earth bringing to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want God to take the key and unlock certain things. God's earthly strength is on the earth. &gt;&gt; That's the second for mystery purpose of what God is doing. &gt;&gt; He's having the preeminence through his body. The keys on the shoulder so he can perfectly unlock what he wants to unlock and lock what he wants to lock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we keep sitting and waiting for God to do everything. &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Lord, give me the key. Give me the key. The Lord is saying, "But the key is on your shoulder." You have the key. The key is the revelation, but you don't know how to use the key. You're waiting for somebody else to come and take the key. Praise the Lord. Now, closing with our last thought there. Remember what we read in St. John 14 verse 17. Where is the Lord right now? Maybe maybe this won't make any sense to you or maybe you don't even believe it because you don't believe the Holy Spirit is God Almighty. Maybe you're a trinitarian. Hello. &gt;&gt; If you're a Trinitarian, this thing won't mean nothing to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you put up John 14:17 there, you'll see. for he dwelleth with you and shall be. &gt;&gt; So which means Jesus said, "I'll send you another comforter." &gt;&gt; So which means if he wants to use a key, he is in you &gt;&gt; to use the key of David &gt;&gt; to unlock it. &gt;&gt; You mean the the fullness of God is coming into the body? Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You and I hold a certain measure of it. That is why St. John, if you go to verse 20 there, this is key to this is our scripture. Now, that day you shall know, I am in my father, you in me, I in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to realize you are married totally. &gt;&gt; Body, spirit, soul, everything. &gt;&gt; Christ is in you. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Ephesians 17 as our last, sorry, 3:1 17 as our closing here. You say with the fullness in the body. Yes. Let's see if the Bible confirms this. Ephesians 3:17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. That you might that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, length, depth, and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with some of the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; Sure. You mean collectively as the body of Christ, the fullness of God is residing in the body. &gt;&gt; But that's why Satan keeps you divided and you don't like that brother because the fullness is not in one man. &gt;&gt; The fullness is in the body. &gt;&gt; So we hate other people from other churches in the body. &gt;&gt; But we need the fullness. &gt;&gt; We need the unity. We need the love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to break down walls. &gt;&gt; We need to break down barriers. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan is laughing because you fighting with your brother and you got a heal feeling against your brother and you can't stand to fellowship with your brother. And Satan is laughing because you are disempowered. &gt;&gt; You're only moving here with 2% power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Disconnected from the rest of the body. trying to fly but your engine 2% power you're flying with &gt;&gt; because you are not connected with the rest of the body. You see why it's dangerous to be in churches that tell you don't fellowship with other people. Don't go to combined meetings. Don't go to convention. Don't connect with the rest of the body. What are they doing? Disconnecting you from charging. &gt;&gt; If my battery died, what do I need to do? Take jumper cables, get brother Jaffford's car, plug it into his battery, and suddenly my engine starts to swing. Yes. &gt;&gt; But if you call formal in your house, they're saying press play, press play, press play. &gt;&gt; Where is the key? &gt;&gt; The body. &gt;&gt; You in your house alone. &gt;&gt; Battery is dead. I know you know you can't leave a battery too long without charging. &gt;&gt; What happens to the battery? &gt;&gt; Go leave your car for a couple months. Don't drive it. Don't start it. See what happens. and go see if you can even try and restore that battery. If it's a very strong battery, maybe most of the time they'll tell you, "Sorry, this battery is gone. You need a new one." &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying preserve what you have. &gt;&gt; There's no replaceable batteries here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What God has given you, treasured. &gt;&gt; The key to David is on your shoulder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God wants to lock and unlock and bind and loose through you right now.

Come musicians, let's sing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is this teaching for in any of this preaching here? Was it to elevate me? &gt;&gt; Or was it to empower the body? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To make you realize who we are as a body? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the quicker we realize it, the quicker we can get into the throne room. Amen. &gt;&gt; And look, once she got into the throne room, she was given out the kingdom. &gt;&gt; She was given the king's seal. She was given the king's name. Said, "Go rewrite the laws yourself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there is power in the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who operates a spoken word right now? &gt;&gt; You. &gt;&gt; You and I operate the power of the spoken word. Brother Brandon is not here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There are certain things designed only for you to do. Don't try and resurrect brother Brandon from the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; You'll come out with the with the resurrection of the sleeping saints, &gt;&gt; but you always want to quote about the fish he raised. How about you raise your own fish? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; You always want to talk about his squirrels. &gt;&gt; How many of you know you can't eat a squirrel from the past? &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; If you're feeling for squittle, &gt;&gt; you have the power to speak it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in you. Remember who takes responsibility for you.
