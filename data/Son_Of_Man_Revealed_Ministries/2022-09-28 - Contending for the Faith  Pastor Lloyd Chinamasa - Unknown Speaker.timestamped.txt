[21:09] I thought it would be a blessing to all
[21:12] so that people want these to
[21:15] our city looking at their watches and
[21:18] everything this starts from the book of
[21:22] your
[21:23] want to read verse one to three
[21:27] or let's let's just go sketch of a
[21:30] straight beloved when I get all
[21:31] diligence to write unto you of the
[21:34] common salvation it was made for for me
[21:37] to write unto you and exalt you that you
[21:40] should earnestly content for the faith
[21:41] which was once delivered amen
[21:46] amen let's go to the Hebrews chapter 13.
[21:52] this and
[21:54] [Music]
[22:00] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[22:03] and
[22:04] and lastly let's read also Acts chapter
[22:09] 1 verse 8.
[22:14] but you shall receive power and
[22:17] dogs
[22:18] and they shall be Witnesses unto me both
[22:21] in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in

[22:31] the Lord add the blessing to the reading
[22:32] of the world Amen how many are happy
[22:35] tonight
[22:37] amen
[22:44] amen
[22:49] amen uh so I just have a little thought
[22:52] a little inspiration to to talk about
[22:55] tonight uh not very complicated
[22:59] I'm someone who doesn't really give much
[23:02] of a long titles complicated titles you
[23:06] know the Bible is very simple the gospel
[23:08] is very simple
[23:09] Jesus Christ was very simple or not
[23:12] until the Bible says common people he
[23:16] had him glad a man common people he had
[23:21] him gladly the message of the hour is
[23:23] not complicated you look at the life of
[23:26] the Prophet you could preach through
[23:27] nature and all that the way he was born
[23:29] he was never born in a big city was
[23:33] never born among other places in America
[23:35] you can think of New York or the the
[23:38] great places that are spoken about uh he
[23:40] kept there from Kentucky our Lord Jesus
[23:43] Christ until
[23:45] anything good come out of Nazareth and
[23:49] Nathaniel uh Phillips they come and see
[23:53] amen the gospel is just simple and if we
[23:57] become like children uh then we'll see
[24:01] more of God in our lives that's why the
[24:03] Lord say unless we we are converted like
[24:06] these little children we cannot enter in
[24:08] we cannot see the kingdom of God we
[24:10] cannot enter in uh the prophet also
[24:13] preached the message and say God hiding
[24:14] something Simplicity The Villages of in
[24:17] the same way uh that's how the gospel is
[24:21] we have to be simple to to see God and
[24:24] sometimes we we preach things that
[24:27] people may not understand but we are not
[24:29] called to understand we are caught up
[24:31] early all things only believe all things
[24:34] are possible to them that can believe
[24:36] and I I believe we are believers of the
[24:39] Bible I believe we are the Believers of
[24:41] the message of the hour I didn't bring
[24:43] anything new my title tonight is
[24:45] contenting for the message
[24:47] that's what I'm just talking about
[24:48] tonight I'm not bringing anything new
[24:51] than what you already know that which
[24:53] you hear every day from different
[24:54] ministers from the pastor here the local
[24:56] pastors wherever they come from is just
[24:59] a message of the hour and this message
[25:01] of the hour we can never exhaust it
[25:03] inexorable Fountain of power in
[25:06] exhaustible Fountain of Life in
[25:08] exhaustible Fountain you can't bring any
[25:10] new revelation but represent progresses
[25:13] but uh or what is needed for us for the
[25:16] Rapture lays in the church in the Box
[25:18] there's nothing else that we can bring
[25:20] there's nothing else that we can preach
[25:22] except this message of the hour that's
[25:24] what God gave us for this generation he
[25:26] saw it fit to give us the message of the
[25:28] hour that is so glorious you know my
[25:31] brother and nothing can be taken from it
[25:33] and nothing can be added to it let's
[25:35] just take the message as it is and the
[25:38] prophet say what the temps say it's not
[25:40] really like coming here and just read
[25:42] the Bible from Genesis to Revelation
[25:44] when you say say what the tips say he
[25:47] say whatever you'll be preaching let it
[25:48] be in line with the Bible are rightly
[25:52] dividing the word of Satan that's that's
[25:54] what really it means you say one that
[25:56] said to say it's not a repetition of
[25:58] words but preaching in light with the
[26:01] message of the hour preaching in the in
[26:05] line with the revelation of the message
[26:07] of the power not to deviate from it but
[26:09] just say exactly
[26:11] the message says when we talk about
[26:13] baptism let's baptize in the name of the
[26:16] Lord Jesus Christ what the message say
[26:18] if we dress whatever we do in weight or
[26:21] indeed let's all do in the name of the
[26:24] Lord Jesus Christ the message is not a
[26:27] Doctrine the message is not a Creed the
[26:30] message is the Bible reviewed the
[26:32] message is the opening up of the word we
[26:36] ought to be such a happy people in this
[26:39] generation because we understand the
[26:41] Bible now by the message of the hour we
[26:45] now know how to approach God by the
[26:47] message of our brothers you can help me
[26:49] to fine tune the Sunday uh then I'll
[26:51] tell you when it's when it's right just
[26:53] try to to touch the
[26:55] uh the bathroom there especially on the
[26:58] on the volume there amen thank you very
[27:01] much so I'm speaking on contenting uh
[27:05] for the message of the hour uh the Bible
[27:09] say uh uh you would say Be Loved when I
[27:13] get when I give all diligence to write
[27:17] unto you of the common salvation it was
[27:20] needful for me it was necessary it was
[27:23] of necessity I mean someone said Amen to
[27:26] that it was needful for me to write unto
[27:29] you and exalt you and encourage you and
[27:33] remind you that we must earnestly
[27:35] contained for the faith that was what
[27:38] delivered unto the Saints and we know in
[27:41] this day we have a scriptures pertaining
[27:44] to this day we have scripture that
[27:46] speaks of our day which is kind of like
[27:48] our our syllabus when we want to bring
[27:51] it to our common to our modern day
[27:54] understanding our syllabus like in the
[27:57] days of Noah the word of God was the
[27:59] building of the Ark according to the
[28:01] measurements that God was given to his
[28:03] prophet of the generation that time and
[28:06] we know that we have scriptures we have
[28:08] promises of God to us in this day
[28:11] Malachi 4 Luke 17 10 and all that and
[28:16] the Bible tells us in promises and that
[28:18] Beholder I said unto you Elijah that
[28:21] Prophet what was he coming to do was to
[28:24] turn our hearts back to the purpose in
[28:27] the Turning of the hearts is the Turning
[28:29] of the faith is not the heart relatively
[28:32] but telling the faith of the children
[28:35] back to the fathers because we believe
[28:37] from the heart thus telling the hearts
[28:40] and I believe tonight we are living in
[28:42] an hour when we can say this day Malachi
[28:46] fall is fulfilled before us hallelujah
[28:49] this thing is not working properly
[28:52] to be honest enough yeah
[28:56] there's a lot of abounding
[29:00] they just put a volume on maximum
[29:03] then remove the echo and the best if you
[29:08] remove the egg on your press then you
[29:10] put the volume on maximum it will it
[29:13] will help me well I don't want to
[29:15] divorce I still have a lot of days to
[29:18] pray how is it now how is it coming is
[29:21] it improving
[29:22] amen so turning the Huts that's telling
[29:25] our faith that's taking our faith back
[29:29] to Apostolic
[29:31] turning our faith back to pay the cost
[29:34] amen we must believe the same way they
[29:37] believe we must live the same way they
[29:40] lived we must decrease the same way they
[29:42] preached we must receive the same result
[29:44] they saw Hallelujah
[29:47] that's contenting for the freedom that
[29:50] was once delivered to the Saints now I
[29:52] just want to bring a brief background of
[29:55] what does it mean to contain to contain
[29:58] is to hold on and to maintain the same
[30:02] thing which was given to content is to
[30:06] stand there is to stand still upon what
[30:09] they've been already given and the Bible
[30:11] said we are built upon the foundation of
[30:14] the Apostles and prophets in Jesus
[30:16] Christ himself paying the Chief
[30:18] Cornerstone and we must be content for
[30:20] that we must hold on to this message of
[30:23] the hour which has been delivered to us
[30:26] in this generation we must be World
[30:28] honor it doesn't make sense to us today
[30:30] if we if we just be ex get excited by
[30:34] the revelation of the message of the
[30:35] hour without leaving it if we are just
[30:37] excited by cutting the potassium without
[30:40] seeing the same result just many excited
[30:43] by just saying I need a message we're
[30:45] not seeing the power of the message of
[30:47] the hour we must see anything Contender
[30:49] we have to hold on we must maintain the
[30:53] same thing which we have received in
[30:56] this day in the fullness of his power in
