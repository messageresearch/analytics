[0:00] So let's turn to Isaiah 1:19 for opening
[0:02] scripture. It says, "Come now and let us
[0:05] reason together, sayeth the Lord. Though
[0:07] your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
[0:10] white as [music] snow."
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Though they be red like crimson, they
[0:16] shall be as will.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; So that's what the blood of Jesus can
[0:19] do. Completely change our lives and turn
[0:22] us around. I want to get to the next
[0:24] verse. There's a promise attached now.
[0:26] If you be willing and obedient, you
[0:29] shall eat the good of the land.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; If you're willing and obedient, you
[0:34] shall eat the good of the land.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; But there's the downside to it. There's
[0:39] pros and cons to everything, right?
[0:41] &gt;&gt; Here's the con. If you re if you refuse
[0:44] and rebel, you shall be devoured with
[0:46] the sword, for the mouth of the Lord has
[0:49] spoken it.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; 1 Kings 19, we read 11 and 12.
[0:55] So this is the prophet Elijah here on
[0:58] the mountain.
[1:00] And he said, "Go forth and stand upon
[1:01] the mount before the Lord." And behold,
[1:04] the Lord passed by and a great and a
[1:06] strong wind [music] read the mountains
[1:08] and break in pieces the rocks before the
[1:10] Lord. But the Lord was not in the wind.
[1:15] And after the wind and earthquake, but
[1:17] the Lord was not in the earthquake.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And after the
[1:22] earthquake a fire but the Lord was not
[1:25] in the fire. And after the fire a still
[1:29] small voice. So that still small voice
[1:33] is the Holy Spirit. [music]
[1:37] &gt;&gt; Now the promise of the Holy Spirit was
[1:39] given when our Lord Jesus ascended to
[1:41] heaven.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; He told him to tell me in the upper
[1:46] room. when he was ascending he said you
[1:48] shall receive power now as the world
[1:50] becomes more dependent upon artificial
[1:53] intelligence and you'll find it even
[1:55] coming into your very own devices that
[1:58] artificial intelligence is available to
[2:00] all of us
[2:01] &gt;&gt; now you can use artificial intelligence
[2:04] in a limited way and you can use it like
[2:06] Google to ask you questions and it'll
[2:08] answer you or you can use it in a much
[2:10] more advanced ways and know how to
[2:12] prompt it
[2:16] there's an intelligence designed that
[2:17] will unlock an entire new world to you.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; But the key is knowing how to prompt it,
[2:25] knowing how to work with it, knowing how
[2:27] to give it the right commands.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; Now, that is called artificial.
[2:33] There's no animal intelligent as a man.
[2:36] Man is the highest form of intelligence
[2:38] on the earth. Amen.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; God wants us to be able to use not now
[2:42] our own human intelligence, but within
[2:44] us, he's given us something that's
[2:46] called supreme intelligence.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; This intelligence is not the
[2:51] intelligence of the mind.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; This intelligence is supernatural
[2:57] intelligence.
[3:00] The Holy SPIRIT, IF YOU'LL HEAR WHAT THE
[3:01] how the Lord Jesus describes him, he's
[3:04] called a comforter. He's called a
[3:06] teacher. He's called the guide. He's
[3:09] called the spirit of truth. He's called
[3:11] the advocate.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; He's called the seal.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; He's called the token.
[3:18] Can you see how intelligent this supreme
[3:20] intelligence is?
[3:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; It's here to lead [singing] man and
[3:23] guide man in every area of our lives.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; Now, WE CAN CHOOSE TO IGNORE THAT WITHIN
[3:28] us
[3:30] or we can unlock its full potential.
[3:32] Amen.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Many people in this life don't want to
[3:36] move ahead with technology. People still
[3:38] want to live in an awesome buggy age.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; They're Amish. They refuse to
[3:42] acknowledge scientific progress.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; So they still travel by awesome cut.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[3:48] &gt;&gt; And maybe even with us, some of us say,
[3:50] "Oh, you know what? I'm old school. I
[3:52] don't depend on technology. I don't
[3:53] depend on these things." Then you still
[3:55] can live in an awesome bike age. Now the
[3:57] prophet of God would tell us that my my
[4:00] uh great-grandfather traveled in an oen
[4:02] buggy and he say my father traveled in a
[4:05] certain thing. He says I travel in an
[4:06] automobile and he says I'm expecting my
[4:09] grandchildren to travel by jet plane.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; So as science progresses
[4:18] the church of God was also supposed to
[4:20] progress.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; We are not behind science. The prophet
[4:24] of God in his day said, "Science has
[4:26] taken man farther in the realms of the
[4:28] spir in the realms of science than the
[4:30] preachers have taken the church in the
[4:32] realms of the spirit."
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; But I want to say that's not so this
[4:36] morning.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[4:38] We are taking you into the realms of the
[4:40] spirit where we are now seated together
[4:42] in heavenly places where all things are
[4:45] possible.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; So we can choose to ignore this
[4:50] intelligence that's within us. And I
[4:53] want you to know something about this
[4:54] intelligence.
[4:56] I'm going to [music] first now talk
[4:58] about artificial intelligence. The
[5:00] creators of artificial intelligence,
[5:02] they call them the godfathers of
[5:04] artificial intelligence are sending
[5:06] warnings to the world. They're saying
[5:08] what we started to create, he said it's
[5:10] going to cause chaos on the earth.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; They are starting to warn about this
[5:14] artificial intelligence and they say
[5:16] it's eventually going to lead to the
[5:17] destruction of mankind.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:23] I want you to know that when a prophet
[5:24] sees things, he sees something ahead of
[5:26] time and he probably can't fully
[5:28] describe it.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Was it Ezekiel? You saw chariots with
[5:32] light torches,
[5:34] &gt;&gt; but he was talking about cars.
[5:37] Now when Daniel was seeing this image of
[5:38] the beast uh this beast representing the
[5:42] kingdoms when he saw [music] it get into
[5:44] iron
[5:47] and clay.
[5:49] It takes a prophetic gift now to be able
[5:51] to interpret that.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; BUT THE PROPHETIC GIFT ALSO UNFOLDS
[5:55] ITSELF.
[5:56] Praise the Lord. [music and singing]
[5:58] &gt;&gt; Because you'll find if you do a study on
[6:00] it, the prophet will not only attach you
[6:02] to one thing in particular. Yes.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; He first says [singing] it's the it's
[6:06] between the the the Roman Catholics and
[6:08] the Protestants.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; Then he talks about communist and the
[6:15] other side.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; So he's not detailing it to one thing.
[6:18] It's an unfolding revelation.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Now iron, like I said, it's the 26th
[6:27] chemical compound. [music]
[6:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And clay is where man was taken
[6:32] from the earth. So, could it be
[6:35] that it finally gets to where it's going
[6:38] to be an artificial intelligence they're
[6:40] trying to join with man and what they
[6:42] will eventually try to present as the
[6:43] mark of the beast? I said it's an
[6:45] unfolding revelation.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Remember, there's coming a time now
[6:50] where no man will be able to buy or sell
[6:51] except he take the mark of the beast.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Could this be the year that the money
[6:56] system collapses?
[6:58] &gt;&gt; That they go back on the gold standard.
[7:00] Who owns the wealth of the world? The
[7:03] gold.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; America owns the the the largest supply
[7:07] of gold.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Germany comes next and next is Rome.
[7:13] &gt;&gt; But there's a catch there. Because the
[7:15] prophet says Rome holds the gold of the
[7:18] world. [music]
[7:19] &gt;&gt; And he says the Jews hold the paper in
[7:21] Wall Street.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; He says they're going to come together
[7:24] and form an alliance and a and
[7:26] agreement. But he says they're going to
[7:28] break the covenant.
[7:30] Amen. You know these things because of
[7:32] the valley of the opening of the seals.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; The prophet revealed all of these things
[7:35] to us. [music]
[7:36] &gt;&gt; And he says how they will come now and
[7:39] they will destroy the present money day
[7:41] system.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; But we have moved now. And if you notice
[7:47] on January 3rd, significant changes,
[7:50] significant things happened on January
[7:52] 3rd this year.
[7:56] That fault line started to crack on
[7:59] January 3rd. It was on January 3rd that
[8:01] Trump decided to invade
[8:04] Venezuela
[8:05] &gt;&gt; and take captive that president.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; So January 3rd already things started to
[8:11] shift.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something that was
[8:14] out of desperation.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Like I told you on Wednesday, they
[8:19] starting to get rid of the petro dollar
[8:20] which is the dollar which was an an
[8:22] international currency. in which to
[8:24] trade by
[8:25] &gt;&gt; and now they're going and they're using
[8:27] normal currencies and this bricks is
[8:29] causing major upsets in the world.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; All the nations that are aligned with
[8:35] bricks
[8:37] are causing major tensions in the world
[8:39] and that's why USA can't stand it now
[8:41] because that's an opposition [music]
[8:42] force to them. But what I'm trying to
[8:43] show you in all of this, God's prophetic
[8:45] calendar is moving along.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; And this was all prophesied. This was
[8:49] all spoken about. Now we seeing it
[8:50] unfolding before our very own eyes.
[8:53] Amen.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; Now before before Alaska go before
[8:57] California sings, the bride will be
[8:58] gone.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; So, are we prepared for this hour? And
[9:09] when I'm asking, are we prepared for the
[9:11] hour? God has given us something [music]
[9:13] to help us in this time and season.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; He didn't call the refilling of the Holy
[9:18] Ghost the dynamics for nothing. Yes,
[9:20] [music]
[9:20] &gt;&gt; it means that supreme intelligence has
[9:22] got to awaken within us.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; And like I said, we can choose to ignore
[9:25] this intelligence that's given to us.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; If God has opened up technology to us,
[9:30] we should use it for God's kingdom. But
[9:31] the Bible says the television could have
[9:33] been a blessing, but it's become a
[9:34] curse.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; Listen to the still small voice.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; We can know you got a technology. Some
[9:42] people still get lost everywhere they
[9:43] go, but they got a phone and they got
[9:46] Google Maps.
[9:48] No me I don't rely on that thing then
[9:50] that woman is giving me all wrong
[9:51] directions [music]
[9:54] we can choose to ignore something that's
[9:56] given to us
[9:59] or we can unlock it full potential
[10:03] &gt;&gt; I say it again the Holy Ghost is our
[10:06] supreme supernatural intelligence given
[10:08] to us in this time and season
[10:10] &gt;&gt; but many people are ignoring it many
[10:14] people don't know how to activate it
[10:16] &gt;&gt; now if it's the TEACHER
[10:19] YOU'RE ALLOWED TO ASK A teacher
[10:21] questions.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; So only of us have activated the
[10:26] anointing of teacher, the Holy Ghost in
[10:28] me and say, "Holy Ghost, please lead me
[10:30] and guide me in this. I need an answer
[10:31] to this. You are my teacher."
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. [singing and music]
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Please teach me this.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; But we can't do it in the noise of all
[10:39] the other voices. We've got to get alone
[10:41] and be quiet with the Lord.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music]
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Knowing how to hear the spirit's voice.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; When in a certain problem, a certain
[10:51] struggle, go to the inner teacher.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; He's called a guide.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; How about we activate THE GUIDE?
[11:00] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE'RE GOING THROUGH A PROBLEM, A
[11:01] SITUATION, and maybe heartache and and
[11:04] depression and brokenness and anxiety,
[11:06] he's called a comforter.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I need to phone Dr. [music]
[11:09] Abdul Muhammed and phone and check the
[11:11] psychologist if he's available. No,
[11:15] &gt;&gt; you've given
[11:16] &gt;&gt; a comforter. [music]
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; You don't believe your brother. I'll
[11:26] take you to court. Come here.
[11:29] I'll put a lie detector test, but he's
[11:31] called the spirit of truth.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Paul didn't go to call brother Joshua
[11:37] and say, "Come here, brother Joshua.
[11:39] I need an affidavit." when he [singing]
[11:41] was dealing with Ananas and Safh
[11:44] give me a sworn affidavit that you
[11:47] didn't sell this land for this amount he
[11:49] relied on the spirit of truth
[11:53] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you this hidden
[11:54] intelligence given to us [music] that we
[11:56] don't use
[11:59] &gt;&gt; he's called a guide he's called a
[12:00] comforter he's called a teacher [music]
[12:02] he's called a spirit of wisdom
[12:06] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[12:07] &gt;&gt; he can unlock within us potentials
[12:11] And do you know that the this becomes
[12:13] now personified in us
[12:16] that you become when the Holy Ghost is
[12:19] in you and you fully surrender to him.
[12:21] You walk into the room and the Holy
[12:22] Ghost walks into a room.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; When you speak, they hearing the spirit
[12:27] of wisdom. [music]
[12:28] &gt;&gt; When you speak, they're hearing the
[12:29] spirit of truth.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not detached from us.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost becomes one with us when
[12:37] we are so healed and surrendered to him.
[12:39] Yes, sir.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
