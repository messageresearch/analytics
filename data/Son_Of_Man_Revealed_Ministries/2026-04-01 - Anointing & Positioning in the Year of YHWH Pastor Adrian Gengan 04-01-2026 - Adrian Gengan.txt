TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Meet everyone in the mighty name of Jesus. I trust the new year's been kind to you thus far. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you command the new year. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't say we'll see what the new year brings. You speak &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; over your situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are certain walls that God is not going to bring down. &gt;&gt; You need to bring it down. &gt;&gt; There are certain mountains that God's not going to move. You need to move it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God could have moved the walls of Jericho himself. &gt;&gt; But they had something to do to march around those walls. Amen. &gt;&gt; Take possession. Take authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not the time and season to pray to God. Move this mountain. Move this mountain. This is the time of Mark 11:23 where you speak to the mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's turn to Isaiah 10:27. And all of this is because of an anointing that's been released to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know God's not working with denominations? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; God is working with us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you brother. Amen. Amen. And uh let's remember those that are unwell. I think this is Kim's unwell. There was a few people. Remember brother Joshua his family. Amen. On the way to Johannesburg. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I told them to get in touch with you. I believe they're not too far from you. Amen. Fellowship day. Amen. So our brother's a worker here. So try and get him involved. Amen. So we we need somebody else to do our projection and our camera work for now. Praise the Lord. Amen. Then also remember Sister Grace that's unwell with the flu, but God's been gracious to us &gt;&gt; that even though Sister Grace is not here, he gave us another Sister Grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will not leave us in 2026 without his grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We welcome you, Sister Grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pray you be blessed in the house of the Lord. Amen. Let's turn to Isaiah chapter 20 uh chapter 10 verse 27. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Everyone feeling good in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the Bible says, "And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder." &gt;&gt; Now remember the shoulder is his body &gt;&gt; and his yoke from off thy neck. And the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of the anointing you are carrying. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yolks shall be destroyed. &gt;&gt; Sicknesses shall be healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You shall not be in lack because of the anointing. Then we go to 1 John 2 verse 20. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise God. &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:20 says, "But you have an uncction from the Holy One, and you know all things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you know we are positioned in this time where none of the word is hidden to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:7 has already sounded. The mystery of God is already finished. &gt;&gt; Seven seals have been opened. Seven thunders have been been known to the bride. The mind of Christ has been revealed to her. I'll read it again. But you have an uncction from the Holy One, &gt;&gt; and you know all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; We drop down to verse 27 there. &gt;&gt; But the anointing &gt;&gt; which you have received of him abideth where? &gt;&gt; In you. &gt;&gt; The anointing is in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So don't doubt yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. much forward with purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's an anointing in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you need not that any man teach you. &gt;&gt; Do you know there's something on the earth right now called artificial intelligence? &gt;&gt; And man is teaching artificial intelligence, &gt;&gt; and they are going to teach you to a place where artificial intelligence will take over most of the jobs, &gt;&gt; most of the commands. &gt;&gt; Do you know right now there's a system on the earth that are guiding millions of people. It's Google maps and city. &gt;&gt; Thousands, millions of people around the world are instructing that thing to please guide them wherever they are going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we are saying there's an anointing in you, the Holy Ghost which is leading you and guiding you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is much more superior than artificial intelligence. &gt;&gt; Amen. The anointing which you have received of him abideth in you, and you need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointed teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it is at &gt;&gt; taught you, you shall abide in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray. Father, we thank you for your word. We pray Lord that you bless your word. We know your word is already blessed, anointed. Father, I pray Lord you'll find an abiding place in our hearts now even as we father continue. We pray for your Holy Spirit be in attendance. Oh God, we ask it in Jesus name. Amen. May be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what a time and season we have entered into now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are at the brink of our body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just for a little illustration, when the prophet came and the seals were opened up to him, that was a shout message to gather living saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, for a little illustration, if this was 63, seals are open. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; 60 years have passed. We are not there anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If this is now eternity, I'd say we are almost here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. The prophetic wheels have moved on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't be looking at the message from a historical point of view. &gt;&gt; The message have progressed with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message has been moving with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So, we are talking about this anointing that's in us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we've got to awaken that anointing in us. &gt;&gt; I pray that this you will awaken greater potentials within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. greater giftings within you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. If there are giftings within the church, we are praying that this will be the year, the season that will unlock those doors for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That it will not remain dormant anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God may have had you in a season and a purpose in a specific area for a time in your life. You may have been taking care of sheep. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you're already anointed by the prophet Samuel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when time and season comes around, he positions you in front of a giant and you can't go back to taking care of sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was one stage of the journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David didn't sit there as being king and wondering what's happening to the sheep. &gt;&gt; That season had passed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when GOD ANOINTS YOU, WHEN GOD PROMOTES YOU, you've got to move with the anointing of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We find here the prophet is saying now in the message shalom God stands on the promised word for each new year &gt;&gt; 2025 is finished people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; 2025 is finished and all the promises associated with 2025 is finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Whatever anointing God had for 2025, it's finished. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God is not scrambling now. I didn't forget. I didn't do certain things in 2025. Let me doubt do it in 2026. The prophet is saying he stands on the promised word for each new year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are things that will try and creep up in into your life now that was there in 2026 that was plaguing you. &gt;&gt; The Amalachites were upon you. &gt;&gt; Demon powers were oppressing you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; DON'T LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR them to come into the new year. &gt;&gt; SHUT THE DOOR ON IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. CLOSE YOUR EARS TO ALL NEGATIVITY. YES. &gt;&gt; CLOSE YOUR EARS TO ALL PROBLEMS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE VICTORIOUS IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; You got to declare it WITH YOUR OWN MOUTH. THIS IS NOT THE SEASON THINKING about your problems. This is the season for you to speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen to what he says now. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Now, it's a new year, right? 2026. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Our prophet IS TELLING US THAT GOD stands on his promise for each new year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want TO UNLOCK THOSE PROMISES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I WANT TO unlock the anointing for this year. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He stands on it. Who stands on it? God stands on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God is standing on the promise for this year, I WANT TO STAND ON the promise for this year. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To fulfill what he's got promised for this year. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't just think your life is just continuing the same. I have the same old problems, the same old worries. No. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; You put your worries under your feet. &gt;&gt; You put your problems under your feet. Amen. &gt;&gt; You declare that I am victorious in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now listen, whatever it is, now you can replace whatever with whatever you are trusting the Lord for. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, I want to be right in the center of his will in the future like they did like the people of the past. &gt;&gt; They trusted in the promise of God. &gt;&gt; So he's saying, I want to be right in the center of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. So for the the new year is determined by God. &gt;&gt; Now many people think I'm going to determine the new year. &gt;&gt; They they run ahead of God's plan. &gt;&gt; God positions you in a certain place. You people can't wait for the promise to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; People get anxious. &gt;&gt; Other people are getting promoted. Other people are getting married. Other people are thriving. Other people are progressing. What about me? You wait. God has a plan for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the if the neighbor has a building plan here, I can't build my house on his building plan. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has blueprints for my life. &gt;&gt; You know what you're going to do? Sell yourself short. &gt;&gt; Because the neighbor may have a singlestory house designed for his life. God has a doublestory house designed for your life. If you do according to his plan, you're going to do yourself short. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't be mistaken. God is not haphazard regarding his plan for you. &gt;&gt; He's got a blueprint for every one of our lives. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; We've got to trust his plan. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TO TRUST HIS PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; Do you know what God's ultimate design for you? For you to reach glorification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you to have a BODY CHANGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS SPECIFICALLY designed a plan for your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joseph's life was not like David's life. &gt;&gt; It was different. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. If you do a study on on how God delivers because 40 is the number of God's deliverance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he says at the 41st year everything he delivered them. The 41st year. Go look at that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the 41st year. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I am saying God's going to deliver you from things that you thought you would never get out of. &gt;&gt; Sicknesses that were plaguing your body that you never thought you would overcome. God already healed you. God already delivered you. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Grace was telling us, "Amen, she put shoes on that she hadn't put on for 2 years &gt;&gt; since the accident." &gt;&gt; And she says, "I don't care about the pain. I'm putting my shoes on and I'm going to the house of the Lord to worship." &gt;&gt; That is faith in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do things that you couldn't normally do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If sickness has held you back in certain area of your life, you go and do things that your body won't allow you to do. and you command it and you already declare 1 Peter 2:24 over your life and declare by the stripes of Jesus I am healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your body has to obey your confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now listen, before nature can uh obey your confession, how about we start with our own body obeying our confession. &gt;&gt; Before we speak to the wind, before we speak to animal life, BEFORE WE SPEAK TO PLANT LIFE, speak to your own body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak to your own situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says the new year is determined by God. Just determined to stay in his word. Walk where the word says walk. Don't wander off on our own path. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is speaking in this hour. &gt;&gt; Walk where the word says walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says new year. New year. What about the new year? Brings new hope. So don't be hopeless. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your prophet is telling YOU IT BRINGS NEW HOPE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We're one year closer, one day closer than we was yesterday. We don't look back, we look forward. &gt;&gt; New year doesn't mean turning a page, &gt;&gt; Amen. We turn to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we don't know what tomorrow holds, &gt;&gt; but the word does. &gt;&gt; So, we turn to the word and he will guide us. He says, now I just put this here because I want to show you something about artificial. He says just like that light shining out there, the sunshine, that's God's spoken word. &gt;&gt; There's nothing else can give light like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing else can give light like the sunlight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He says any artificial light burns out in a little bit, bulbs and everything else, but that never fails for it's the spoken word of God made manifest. Now, as the world is positioning themselves now and trusting in artificial intelligence, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; I am saying there's an intelligence put into you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Since the day of Pentecost, &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN RELYING on that intelligence. &gt;&gt; It is supreme intelligence. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT IS SUPERNATURAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS IN EVERY SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD THAT IS BORN AGAIN. IT IS CALLED THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO JOHN 14 SAYS that this Holy Ghost, you know, artif artificial intelligence will have to train you to comfort you. &gt;&gt; Maybe if you're depressed or down and out, this can now speak to you. &gt;&gt; Think about your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Just breathe in and breathe out. &gt;&gt; They can design it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Calm down. &gt;&gt; I can have very soothing things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in St. John, Jesus is telling us, I'm going to send you a comforter. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We want to go to a psychiatrist to find comfort. The the comforter that was sent is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In fact, YOU SHOULD GO TO THE PSYCHIATRIST AND COMFORT HIM &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT MAN IS LISTENING to nonsense THE WHOLE DAY. HE'S LISTENING TO A BUNCH OF MAD PEOPLE THE WHOLE DAY. AND MOST PSYCHOLOGISTS AND psychiatrist go mad anyway. &gt;&gt; Listening to all their problems. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says you watch the company you keep. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; I'd like to tell every psychiatrist and every psychologist, watch what company you keep. &gt;&gt; You invite hundreds of people into your office every day and you listen to all their nonsense. Their spirits jump on them. That's why psychiatrists are living off medication and all of these things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't fall for the trap of the devil. This year you go to the doctor's office and there is proclaiming stuff &gt;&gt; over your life. &gt;&gt; He's asking you about your family history. He's asking you, did your father have this? Did your mother have this? &gt;&gt; He wants you to attach to some earthly inheritance and limit. some earthly sickness. &gt;&gt; Your father is God. I'm going to reestablish that. Your father is God and God HAS NEVER BEEN SICK. SO YOU ASK YOU, HAS YOUR FATHER ever been sick? And never. &gt;&gt; My father has never been sick. &gt;&gt; There is no HISTORY OF HEART TROUBLE IN MY FAMILY. THERE IS no history of Oh, come on, PEOPLE OF GOD. THERE IS NO HISTORY OF CANCER IN MY FAMILY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Refuse to accept sicknesses that have your name on it. &gt;&gt; REFUSE TO ACCEPT PROBLEMS THAT HAVE YOUR NAME ON IT. RETURN TO SEND HER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Satan knows how to maneuver us out of our position and our plan of God. &gt;&gt; He knows he's a deceiver. &gt;&gt; So don't fall for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Artificial intelligence. Believe me, some of you are aware. You're in business world. Maybe you are more advanced than us in knowing how advanced this artificial intelligence is becoming. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the prophet of God is establishing something here. He's saying artificial intelligence can never match the sunlight. Artificial light can never match the sunlight. &gt;&gt; I'm reestablishing artificial intelligence will never outdo the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was sent to lead YOU AND GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH. &gt;&gt; YOU GO TO GOOGLE THERE, they got AI there. You ask him about some truth. But there's a greater truth in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know artificial intelligence is only based on what they feed it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So if you go and ask AI regarding the message of the hour, it's going to also bring up negativity which is false truth. Falsehood. &gt;&gt; But the spirit of truth in you, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; will not be deceived by artificial intelligence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm saying start to rely on the anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David knew that he was anointed. Yes. &gt;&gt; He started to rely on the anointing. The prophet Samuel had anointed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even Jesus began to rely on what the word said about him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When they presented him the book in the temple that day, he went to where the scriptures was written of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When it's your time and season now, let me tell you people OF GOD, WHEN IT'S YOUR TIME AND SEASON NOW, &gt;&gt; AND IT'S YOUR TIME TO BE COUNTED, YOU CAN'T GO TO ANOTHER MAN'S SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GLORY. &gt;&gt; Jesus did not open to I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; That season HAD PASSED. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE light of that day when it was when John the Baptist WAS ON THE EARTH BEFORE JESUS CAME. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN JESUS WAS THERE, THE SCRIPTURES REGARDING HIMSELF HAD TO BE ESTABLISHED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He had to say the spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the spirit wasn't no more in John. The spirit of the sovereign lord is upon me because he has anointed me &gt;&gt; to preach. &gt;&gt; Let's read that scripture. Amen. I got it here somewhere. Amen. So here the prophet is establishing John the Baptist was the light of the hour. &gt;&gt; He was the light before Jesus was the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet Isaiah prophesied about him. Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said you did walk in the light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when WHEN HE'S MOVED PAST JOHN NOW &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Jesus the WORD MADE FLESH IS THERE. &gt;&gt; YES. YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You can't stay in John's message when Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope some of you are here while I'm saying &gt;&gt; 1963 HE SAYS THAT'S OUR LORD UP THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T STAY WITH A LADY MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE LORD HIMSELF, SHALOM IS HERE. ARISE AND SHINE FOR THY LIGHT IS COME AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD IS RISEN UPON THEE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR LIGHT ON THE OUTSIDE. THE THE BIBLE SAYS IT'S RISEN upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; You see, you can't walk in the Lutheran light. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Lutheran light is finished. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; WESLEYAN LIGHT IS FINISHED. METHODIST LIGHT. &gt;&gt; PENTECOSTAL LIGHT IS FINISHED. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE LIGHT OF THE HOUR. The prophet say THE LIGHT HAS COME. RISE AND SHINE. THE WORD LIGHT manifested word of God is a light. &gt;&gt; Amen. says not turn a new page. Turn to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See what the word promises for today. &gt;&gt; See what the light of this day is supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody ask you, where are we in the word? Where are we in the word? If you go to Malachi 4 and Revelation 10, you are pointing to another man's ministry that he already vindicated. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You must open to what it is written of you. &gt;&gt; You must be able to say, "Lo, I come in the VOLUME OF THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; THE WORD IS MADE FLESH IN ME." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I am the one who went to the angel and I took THE BOOK AND I ATE the book. And this is THE SEASON OF MY PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; I AM IN REVELATION 10 11. I AM PROPHESYING AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; You know, we will be defeated if we are not operating in our scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I am not Revelation 10:7. &gt;&gt; No. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I can't have authority &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; on Revelation 10:7. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I am not the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT I AM JOHN, A TYPE OF THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Who went to the ANGEL AND TOOK THE BOOK &gt;&gt; AND ATE THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AND NOW PROPHESYING AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; There are things that we must do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It always ends up in an action. AND THE HOLY GHOST IS THE ACTION OF GOD IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Taking the book was good. &gt;&gt; Eating the book was good. &gt;&gt; BUT THE FINAL PART OF THAT IS TO PROPHESY AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AND this time it season the SPOKEN WORD HAS RETURNED BACK TO THE CHURCH. AND TOO MANY people are silent. &gt;&gt; It's the power of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; It's not the power of the thinking word. &gt;&gt; Some people are deep thinkers. &gt;&gt; I'll think about my problems. I'm plotting our plan. How am I going to do it? No. There's an anointing in you, the spirit of truth which will lead you and guide you out of EVERY TRIAL, EVERY PROBLEM, EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And God loves you too much to let you remain in sin. Let me tell you that GOD LOVES YOU TOO MUCH to let you remain in A BACKSLIDING CONDITION. HE'S GOING TO BUST EVERY CONCRETE.

The Lord's back turned towards her and he discerns a heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. While he's telling Abraham about this promise, &gt;&gt; it's time and season now. I'm going to reproduce my life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sarah laughs. &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you are laughing. You're thinking, "What am I talking about?" &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; You lived with this problem for so long, the situation for so long. You can't see a way out for yourself. I say you don't laugh in the face of God. You accept it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is discerning your heart even now and ask me why are you laughing? &gt;&gt; Why are you doubting? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Wonderful.

AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE CALLED TO DOMINATE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DOMINATE THE BUSINESS AREA. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; When God has uncommon favor on your life, even the unbelievers start calling your name. &gt;&gt; I was hearing the other day. &gt;&gt; Just so happens I don't know whether to be here. Even people high up in the in the in the uh corporate world are messaging us telling us please send me number. &gt;&gt; Amen. because they know he carries a certain grace. They want to connect with him for business. Now, &gt;&gt; but God can only release it to people who know how to handle it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Who stay humble. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, if you're expecting God to open certain things in your life, you know, I was hearing uh uh my cousin tell me this the other day &gt;&gt; and and we were chatting and he was telling me, you know what, you know, it's human tendency when God gives us all these blessings, we turn away from it. Turn away from him, you know. So I'm thinking if you know that is a wrong thing to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why would you do it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It seems like the human nature is that when God starts to bless them, they start to turn away from God. That's the time to seek him even more. &gt;&gt; Because he has he's found something in you that he can entrust. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like the the if you read Genesis 25, the man that he could entrust with 10 talents. &gt;&gt; He says he gave them according to their several ability. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; According to the ability with which you can handle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows if he gave you a million grand right now, some of you will just blow it. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you know that there statist uh statistics &gt;&gt; that most of these people that win lotto hope no one's putting lotto here. &gt;&gt; Please don't get poor in your room now. Gambling and things like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; people don't have to go anymore to the &gt;&gt; betting houses. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they got apps now on their phone. &gt;&gt; They're getting poor in their room. &gt;&gt; Oh god. &gt;&gt; Before the parents used to say, "Don't go out the house." Now they're not going out the house. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Before it was a thing where they go to meet prostitutes. &gt;&gt; Now the prostitutes are coming in the house through the phone. &gt;&gt; Pornography coming through the phone. All kinds of food coming in the house. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're wondering why the church can't progress. We wondering why the home can't progress. People are living secret lives. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Do you know when the prophet spoke against television, he was speaking against a fourth dimension that science tapped into that was bringing images into the homes of people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is now not an that TV was an infant stage. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now it's a full grown adult. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's bringing to you every sin that's &gt;&gt; like, you know, in the days of Sodom. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Everything that's against God's thoughts and plans, he's bringing it into your home and he's feeding your mind with it. Feeding it, feeding it, it &gt;&gt; you can use it for the good. &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. &gt;&gt; But how many people can say they got the Holy Ghost's anointing to know how to handle it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; So have dominion. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You are made in the blueprint of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now when he's fully redeemed us, we come back to that blueprint. &gt;&gt; Have dominion. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Have dominion. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch your I find the scripture here. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to bring this here to show you the year 2026. 26 in the Hebrew. You know the Hebrew letters have a number attached to it. &gt;&gt; The Hebrew number is 26. It's it means the divine name of God which is Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If if you do your natural breath &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; like this. They say in our natural breathing we are saying Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They say in our natural breathing we are constantly calling Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Yahweh. We are in our natural breathing. Breathe in and out. It brings out Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So it's the divine name of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in 2026, make him Lord of your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Make him Lord of everything. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's formed by this. hair &gt;&gt; 10 565 those alphabets &gt;&gt; and the sum of these are 26 &gt;&gt; symbolizing God's eternal presence &gt;&gt; because if you make him Lord his presence is &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say with you his presence is in you &gt;&gt; we are past that time now I was just listening to a song in the car and the Holy Spirit convicted me and I told my wife I turned the song off &gt;&gt; and I said let's keep sing the next one and told my wife why &gt;&gt; because God's start looking for infants now. You know, children, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; you you hold a hand and you make them walk, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But you see Zoe is walking now. She don't need &gt;&gt; assistance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is Sister Sarah holding a hand to walk? &gt;&gt; No, we're in Galatians 2:20. Where? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Christ is &gt;&gt; in us. &gt;&gt; It's not God with us anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we start to unlock the wrong anointing, we'll be walking with a picture skewed. &gt;&gt; So, we can't sing songs like, "I can't even walk without you holding my head." &gt;&gt; God's looking for mature sons and daughters of God who can stand and take the position of the earth. Now, &gt;&gt; Lord, amen. &gt;&gt; If you apply that scripture, if that song, I can't even walk without you holding my hand, then you won't be able to speak to your mountain &gt;&gt; because you are expecting God to move mountains. Yes. Yes. Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We sing other songs to which we need to stop. &gt;&gt; He can move mountains. &gt;&gt; Where in the scripture does it say he must move the mountain? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He calls walls to fall. Jericho walls. He didn't break it down. The people had to physically go and do something. Let me tell you something. If the children of Israel didn't walk around those walls, those walls would have not fallen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURAL INSTRUCTION WAS YOU WALK AROUND THE WALL. &gt;&gt; And if you walk around the wall, the wall will fall. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE SCRIPTURAL INSTRUCTION IS NOT IF YOU PRAY TO GOD AND ask him to move the mountain. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURAL INSTRUCTION IS IF YOU SAY TO THE MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; Tell it what to do and where to go. &gt;&gt; Tell it be thou removed. That's what to do. Tell it where to go. Some of us are not speaking over our situations. People of God. We are expecting somebody else to speak over our situation. The scripture doesn't say call the pastor and let him speak over your situation. It says if you say &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; if you say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Now, some of you know demon powers oppressing your family members. Demon powers oppressing your your wife, your daughters, your sons. Demon powers are all around you, maybe even in your boss. &gt;&gt; But you're just constantly oppressed by him. Why don't you speak to that demon? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't go speak to your boss now and call him a demon, &gt;&gt; but speak. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the devil will find ways to get to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he knows if you are standing on the word, he's going to use every means necessary. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They're going to use lethal force. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of heaven suffer with violence. &gt;&gt; They are using lethal force to come against you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So speak to every demon power that is coming against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Isaiah 54 there that no weapon formed against you shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And every tongue that speaketh against you, God shall shall be condemned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, we are not in the age of infancy now where God is babying us. We are not &gt;&gt; the Lutherans. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; we are not the Wesians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not the Pentecostal babes. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know babes babble. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No, we are not in the age of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We speak &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; fluently. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We speak clearly. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We dominate. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We dominate every sphere of life. &gt;&gt; We dominate every area. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I declare over you right now. Amen. That this is the sovereign year of the Lord. It's the year of Yahweh. If you make him Lord, you shall unlock uncommon favor upon your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm 5:12 says that his favor shall surround us like a shield. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But only if we make him Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God has attached something here now. &gt;&gt; Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Numeric value 26. Let me tell you, it's so close. I told you we are so close here that if you refuse to do it willingly, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; the scripture says, &gt;&gt; let me rephrase if some of you are not following what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; He refused, if you refuse right now to willingly make him Lord, &gt;&gt; we are almost at this point when he's going to return. And the Bible says every knee shall bow &gt;&gt; and every tongue confess that he is Lord. &gt;&gt; So you can choose to do it willingly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To make him Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or you'll be forced to do it when he comes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, could it be in the year of Yahweh? &gt;&gt; That he's asking you to make him Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, now we we are not easily deceived. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And neither are we not deceived in any way to make make us think that because we grew up in the framework of the message that we are message believers. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. The eagle that grew up in the chicken ear didn't make it a chicken. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was always an eagle. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So there are people that grown up within the framework of the message &gt;&gt; that have accepted the prophet &gt;&gt; but have not accepted Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Because we only made them focus on this is the prophet. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we focus on the dos and the don'ts, &gt;&gt; but they never establish a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; To make him Lord and Savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a generation, &gt;&gt; a silent generation that can't worship. &gt;&gt; A silent generation where there are no preachers coming out, where there are no song leaders, there are no deacons. They're just happy to go into the corporate world. Am I right? &gt;&gt; They floating in the framework of the message. &gt;&gt; And their focus is only academic, &gt;&gt; corporate, &gt;&gt; corporate, corporate. How can I climb corporate ladder? &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; You know, God can bypass protocols for you if you're faithful. You don't even have to have a degree. He will make you progress at such a level &gt;&gt; that even they will wonder &gt;&gt; how you got to that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know there's some testimonies here. &gt;&gt; Some of you can testify right here, right now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't hold any official degree. &gt;&gt; But God raised you through the ranks. &gt;&gt; Because of his uncommon favor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Some of you were not supposed to be sitting here perfectly well, but God brought you here perfectly well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It bypassed the doctor's diagnosis of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what they said you were going to end up, &gt;&gt; you didn't end up &gt;&gt; that way. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; it's also in the 26th verse that God says, "Let us make man in our image." &gt;&gt; So, the image was put into man in the 26th. So, could it be in the 26 years that image is going to come back again? &gt;&gt; I'm just asking the question. &gt;&gt; Could it be in the year 2026 the image shall be back on the earth? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Romans 8 man back on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Yes, sir. Glory. &gt;&gt; Could it be? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't know. Could it be &gt;&gt; because the prophet uses what? Psalm to preach the rapture message. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm 27. &gt;&gt; 27. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To preach the rapture message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I promise you there's no theologian that'll ever take Psalm 27 to preach the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; But before he takes us away, we must come in his image. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, let me let me uh put a disclaimer right there. I never said the Lord is coming back in the year 2027. &gt;&gt; You introduce yourself with your own thinking. &gt;&gt; I never said that, right? I'm just putting it out there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Give the Lord a good clap of praise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now watch here the scripture, right? The Lord Jesus takes the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord had appointed me. It's you must find your own scripture and start to declare it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Now watch the scripture how it unfolds. &gt;&gt; He's going to start to preach good tidings to the meek. He's sent to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of prison doors to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus closes the book and he stops reading right then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The acceptable year of the Lord is the year of Jubilee. &gt;&gt; He came to pronounce the year of Jubilee that captives can go free. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CAPTIVES CAME FREE. The Holy Ghost, the supreme intelligence came into man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Then now you know the prophet also took the book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. The priest &gt;&gt; gave him books &gt;&gt; and he preaches this day the scripture is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; We are in the second part of the scripture because Jesus closed the scripture and we are now in the day of the vengeance of our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he's called the wicked one. &gt;&gt; The supreme judge, the cloud, &gt;&gt; the wicked one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's appearing as judge. It's judgment to the world but mercy to the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because a judge has potential to proclaim judgment, but he also has potential to proclaim mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To comfort all that mourn, &gt;&gt; to appoint them. So watch what he's doing now. In the second part of his ministry, he is not. Now, the first part SAID, "I HAVE COME TO do it. &gt;&gt; I have come to SET CAPTIVES FREE. I HAVE COME TO BIND up brokenhearted." But in the second part, IN THE BRIDAL PART of the ministry, he is appointing THEM THAT MOURN IN ZION TO GIVE UNTO THEM BEAUTIFUL ASHES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE OIL OF JOY. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Joy is a oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, people got scars in their life, they use bio oil &gt;&gt; to get rid of scars. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The oil of the Holy Ghost can remove scars permanently. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Internal scars. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified. And listen, &gt;&gt; and after it makes you have the oil of joy and equips you, now you must do something. &gt;&gt; It always ends with action. &gt;&gt; What must you do? They shall build old ways. &gt;&gt; Yes. They shall raise up former desolations and they shall repair the wastities. &gt;&gt; We want God to do everything but he comes to equip us so that we can do things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they shall repair the wastities. The desolation of many generations and the strangers shall feed your flocks. The sons of the aliens shall be your plowman and your vine dressers. And you shall be named the priest of the Lord. I wonder who are kings and priests in this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on. After he took the book, he says, "You shall be called kings and priests. &gt;&gt; You shall reign on the earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You shall be named the priest of the Lord. Men shall call you the ministers of our God. &gt;&gt; You shall prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what a priest does? &gt;&gt; He offers sacrifices. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; On behalf of the people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, if you know something about the law of first fruits, it's January. Yes. &gt;&gt; First fruits mean you offer the first of your crop, the first of your finance, the first of your increase back to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So offer back first fruits to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now we are the living sacrifice, holy and acceptable. &gt;&gt; And God wants us to offer our lives back to him &gt;&gt; as a living sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the first fruit offering is our lives back to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Some of you got nervous on I said that first. &gt;&gt; You thought I'm asking you to put your hand in your pocket. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, some of you are smiling. You should spend so much on the turkey and the chicken and now school fees and all of these things. &gt;&gt; I never I never ask you for money. I'm saying offer your lives a living sacrifice &gt;&gt; as your first fruit offering back to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Offer it back to him to say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; in the year of Yahweh, you be my Lord." &gt;&gt; You know, some of some of you may be renting and the person is called the land Lord. &gt;&gt; He's the owner. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He owns that land. He owns that property. &gt;&gt; God is now the owner. &gt;&gt; He is Yahweh. &gt;&gt; He is the owner of my being. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to end with this now. &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul recognized Yahweh &gt;&gt; as Lord. &gt;&gt; When he was struck down, he answered, "Who art thou?" &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, him being a devout Jew would never have called anything by any other name. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Who art thou?" Yahweh. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said unto me, I am Jesus of &gt;&gt; whom thou persecutest. &gt;&gt; That's Acts 22:8. I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 18:3, Abraham comes to the angels and he he goes to the one in specific and he says, "My Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If now I found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant. Right now, while you are there, I want you to pray this prayer. Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, &gt;&gt; if I found favor in your sight, don't pass me this year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God. Now, I I showed you there. Amen. Three scriptures. Paul, Abraham, I'm showing you the prophet now. He's there in the and he's lost in this uh storm. And the voice speaks to him. says, "I am the God of heaven. That's Yahweh &gt;&gt; who created the heavens and the &gt;&gt; earth." &gt;&gt; I jerked up my hat cap. I just sat still. I listened again. I thought that wasn't the wind. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it was blowing. Said, "I am the one who still the winds upon the mighty sea. &gt;&gt; I am the one, the creator. I created squittles in your presence. I did these things." I said, "Yes, Yahweh." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe you. &gt;&gt; Said, "Stand on your feet." I stood up to my feet. Now speak to the storm. It will do what you tell it to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to speak into your situation in 2026. And I say to you, it will do &gt;&gt; what you tell it to do. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. When a man confesses his sins, gets right with God, God drops the sin of this confession into the blood of his own blood. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to confess your sins and bring it before the blood? &gt;&gt; Listen to what he's saying. Now, &gt;&gt; he drops that sin in the confession of his blood and forgives that sin and replaces in that man the original spirit, the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That should be in there, &gt;&gt; his own spirit, making him a son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you're willing and obedient right now to confess your sin, &gt;&gt; he'll replace that that left because sin is unbelief. A demon will leave you. He'll replace it with the Holy Ghost making you a son of God. And watch it doesn't end there.
