[0:02] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[0:06] he in us because he had given us of his
[0:09] spirit and we have seen and do testify
[0:14] that the father sent the son to be the
[0:16] savior of the world whosoever shall
[0:20] confess that Jesus is the son of God God
[0:23] dwelleth in him and he in God and we
[0:27] have known and believed the love that
[0:30] God had to us God is love and he that
[0:34] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[0:37] in him herein is our love made perfect
[0:41] that we may have Holiness in the day of
[0:45] judgment because as he is so are we in
[0:49] this world there is no fear in love but
[0:51] perfect love casted our fear because
[0:55] fear had torment he that fear is not
[0:58] made perfect in love we love him because
[1:01] he first loved us if a man say I love
[1:05] God and hated his brother he is a liar
[1:09] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:11] he have seen how can he love God who he
[1:16] who he have not
[1:18] seen and this Commandments have we from
[1:21] him that he who loved God love with his
[1:25] brother also amen the the prophet
[1:30] said something very important and I
[1:32] think it's it's good to know it earlier
[1:35] this year than later he said that fear
[1:39] does do it nothing it brings absolutely
[1:42] nothing but faith faith in
[1:45] God it it delivers God delivers in faith
[1:49] 100% so and perfect love we ought to
[1:54] have trust and hope in God Amen
[2:00] amen praise the Lord remain seated amen
[2:03] even as we sing this last chorus and we
[2:05] call our pastor Adrian forward amen
[2:08] let's s touching Jesus is all that
[2:10] matters
[2:14] amen touching
[2:18] Jesus is
[2:21] all that
[2:23] [Music]
[2:27] matters and your love
[2:30] will never
[2:33] be the same there is only and there is
[2:40] only one way to touch him just
[2:48] believe oh just
[2:51] believe when you
[2:54] call on his name touching Jesus
[3:01] touching
[3:03] Jesus is
[3:06] all that
[3:12] matter and
[3:15] your never
[3:18] be the
[3:21] [Music]
[3:24] same there is
[3:27] only only one way
[3:30] we can touch
[3:32] [Music]
[3:35] him we must
[3:39] believe we
[3:41] call on his
[3:46] name amen I greet you all in the
[3:48] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[3:50] Jesus Christ amen it's certainly good to
[3:52] be found in the house of the Lord amen
[3:54] would you greet your brother and sister
[3:56] sitting next to you welcome them in the
[3:57] house of the Lord say God bless you good
[3:59] to see you amen
[4:06] hallelujah amen appreciate and love
[4:08] every one of you amen praying for you I
[4:10] pray you praying for us amen because
[4:13] even as we see the day F approaching we
[4:16] know that the enemy's attack will be
[4:17] greater but we know that the bride is an
[4:20] invincible Army amen amen hallelujah no
[4:23] weapon formed against her shall prosper
[4:25] just want to read a little quote amen uh
[4:27] if the brother can find it in the angel
[4:29] of the the Lord
[4:32] 51052 amen Wednesday we were speaking
[4:35] on are you able to discern the signs of
[4:38] the time like William
[4:39] Brandon
[4:42] amen and we went through amen quite a
[4:44] few things of the Prophet how he would
[4:46] look at events situations he would look
[4:49] at uh blackouts UFOs uh Angels appearing
[4:54] and how you would tie it to signs of the
[4:56] end time he would look at natural
[4:58] disasters he would look at politics he
[5:00] would look at amen all of these things
[5:02] happening because we know these are all
[5:04] key players is to the signs of the end
[5:07] time and one thing that caught our
[5:09] attention was this in paragraph
[5:12] 54 we know amen that uh they had this
[5:15] Golden Globe awards there in LA and they
[5:18] were mocking God Amen on the 6th of
[5:20] January and then on the 7th of January
[5:23] fir broke out amen and this is the quote
[5:27] we want to read over on the east coast
[5:30] they always hollering at me why you
[5:33] going to the West Coast everybody pulls
[5:35] out to Los Angeles maybe that's God's
[5:38] place now we were showing you why that
[5:40] was God's place because Los Angeles is
[5:42] where isza Street Revival
[5:45] started amen so God started a Revival
[5:49] 1906 start of the latest Church age in
[5:52] Los
[5:53] Angeles notice if they reject it
[5:55] judgment must strike so he goes on to
[5:59] say right here is probably where
[6:01] judgment will strike amen he says and
[6:04] that's right let's get ready then he
[6:06] says my this will probably be the first
[6:09] place it'll
[6:11] hit amen this will probably be the first
[6:15] place it'll be hit right in here amen oh
[6:18] Church hold to God's unchanging hand
[6:21] pray amen amen hallelujah so we see all
[6:24] of these signs amen we shouldn't be
[6:28] desensitized
[6:30] amen by our modern day living and our
[6:32] standards of living and and just chasing
[6:34] amen after things in this life we should
[6:36] be so in tune with prophetic word of God
[6:40] to see that these things now brother BR
[6:42] would also say in Gabriel's instructions
[6:44] to
[6:45] Daniel Amen in Gabriel's instructions to
[6:48] Daniel paragraph uh you can find this he
[6:51] says how many has heard me say if you
[6:53] want to know what time of week it is
[6:55] look at the calendar if you want to know
[6:57] what time we're living in he's talking
[7:00] about God's prophetic calendar he says
[7:02] watch the Jews yes amen amen that's
[7:06] God's calendar taken right from there so
[7:09] if we are watching the Jews we know that
[7:12] doors have started to open up we started
[7:15] to speak on the opening up of
[7:16] Dimensional Doors because in the fourth
[7:18] seal it's telling you that a door was
[7:20] open hell was let loose upon the Earth
[7:23] Hell Followed the four Rider so we know
[7:26] that the pope on the 24th of uh December
[7:30] announced that it's the start of the
[7:32] Jubilee for them right onee pilgrimage
[7:36] he announced a jubilee and he opened
[7:38] four important doors they call it only
[7:40] doors right we know that these were not
[7:43] just normal signs because when the pope
[7:45] went amen back in the prophet's day the
[7:47] moon blacked
[7:49] out right we showed you that on
[7:51] Wednesday how the prophet is reading
[7:53] when the moon blacked out what that
[7:54] meant for the
[7:55] church he's not seeing it as a it's an
[7:58] eclipse of the
[8:00] the the moon what a phenomenon he is
[8:03] typing it biblical events and he's
[8:05] saying look how the church is blacked
[8:07] out and he said exactly how signs
[8:09] capture those pictures six phases of the
[8:12] moon he says the Holy Spirit had drawn
[8:14] it on the board amen how the church had
[8:17] blacked out and then we told you that
[8:20] amen January starting now planets are
[8:23] going to line up six planets will line
[8:25] up now and then seven planet planets
[8:28] will line up amen and the prophet is
[8:30] telling you that when the planets line
[8:32] up it's a sign the first sign he says
[8:34] was when the word word was made flesh in
[8:37] Jesus right remember this fortune teller
[8:39] is telling the Prophet this on the bus
[8:41] yes the first time this thing lined up
[8:44] was when Jesus was born what was that
[8:47] word made flesh somebody pay attention
[8:49] now second time he says it would lined
[8:52] up when you were born what was that son
[8:54] of man Ministry word was going to be
[8:56] made flesh again so when planets start
[8:59] to landine up up again could it be a
[9:00] sign that the word is going to be made
[9:02] flesh in the bride amen yes look for it
[9:06] amen expect it so we are looking at all
[9:07] of these things and we are learning
[9:09] these things because of the prophetic
[9:10] gift that was released to the bride amen
[9:13] just like how Esther said under the
[9:15] ministry of Moriah the bride is sitting
[9:17] under the ministry of William brandham
[9:19] and learning how to discern the signs of
[9:21] the time amen so praise the Lord amen
[9:25] so we see now that they negotiated a
[9:28] peace deal there so the prophet said
[9:29] watch the Jews right I just read it he
[9:32] said if you want to know what time watch
[9:33] the
[9:34] Jews and you know there's opening of
[9:36] doors like we are saying these are not
[9:38] ordinary doors right these are demonic
[9:41] doors but the prophet says God will not
[9:44] be defeated he says when all of hell is
[9:46] let loose he says all of Heaven is also
[9:49] let loose on the earth amen so it's time
[9:52] to connect with the Angelic realm amen
[9:55] like Elisha said open the boy's eyes if
[9:57] we are not connected now with the
[9:59] Angelic realm we are going to miss it do
[10:02] you know that every Son of God was
[10:04] connected with the Angelic realm amen if
[10:07] you can put up Daniel 6:22 there amen
[10:09] we'll see what Daniel is saying how you
[10:11] were saved from the Lion's Den what
[10:14] saved
[10:15] Daniel Amen it's interesting we know
[10:18] that uh he wasn't there alone my God had
[10:22] sent his Angel amen amen Daniel is
[10:26] saying the Lions didn't eat me because
[10:28] my God is sent his Angel and had shut
[10:31] the lion's mouth amen so if we are not
[10:33] connected with the Angelic realm right
[10:35] now because angels are ministering
[10:37] spirits to the ear of Salvation that's
[10:39] the Bible so we going to see now from
[10:42] Tomorrow doors are going to open again
[10:44] Trump coming back for his second coming
[10:46] amen you know what's going to happen
[10:48] there amen you can see everyone is
[10:50] bowing down to Trump you got all Tech
[10:53] Giants you got Elon Musk you got Mark
[10:56] Zuckerberg you got amen all of these
[10:58] Tech Giants
[11:00] bowing down amen even this guy from
[11:04] Apple what's his name Steve something
[11:06] this new guy Tim yeah so they all have
[11:10] met with I even read this morning Bill
[11:12] Gates also met with Trump and he says
[11:14] Trump got some fantastic ideas so we can
[11:16] see all of them are bowing down why
[11:19] because of Revelation 13:12 put up
[11:21] Revelation 13:12 there you'll see all of
[11:23] these things coming into play
[11:26] now
[11:27] right and he exercised all the power of
[11:30] the first Beast before him and caused
[11:33] all the Earth and all them which dwell
[11:36] therein to worship the first Beast whose
[11:38] deadly wound was healed so don't expect
[11:40] to see much communication from the pope
[11:43] because the second part of Revelation 13
[11:45] deals with the US speaking with the
[11:48] mouth of the Dragon amen amen amen so
[11:51] they are going to be fulfilling laws and
[11:53] unfolding these prophecies amen so watch
[11:55] now Trump coming in it's going to open
[11:57] up a dimensional door as well because
[12:00] all of these leaders are anointed with
[12:02] Spirits demonic spirits amen praise the
[12:06] Lord so even as we start to see these
[12:09] things unfold the Bible says lift up
[12:12] your head look up because your
[12:14] Redemption is drawing n amen so amen uh
[12:18] we're glad Amen to be found in the house
[12:20] of the Lord I thought I'll just
[12:21] encourage you with that amen uh brother
[12:23] Joshua is going to be sharing the word
[12:24] of the Lord I wasn't too well the last
[12:26] couple of days so I don't know I think
[12:28] I'll be able to preach this morning amen
[12:31] I get in the office and I see brother
[12:33] Joshua was also out with the flu amen
[12:35] hallelujah so but he'll still be
[12:37] ministering he was a very good Steward
[12:40] he didn't fall me back and say I can't
[12:41] make it amen so he's going to preach

[13:20] very glad that he's here this morning

[13:26] his heart amen the the Lord will speak
[13:28] and minister to his heart and uh amen I
[13:31] pray that he'll be blessed in the house

[19:08] the body is tells something else but we
[19:11] pray that God will have his own way amen
[19:14] amen we turn to the Book of Ezekiel
[19:17] reading from chapter
[19:27] 33 ver one
[19:32] to9 and the word of the Lord came unto
[19:35] me saying son of man speak to the
[19:38] children of thy people and say unto them
[19:41] when I bring the sword upon a land if
[19:44] the people of the land take a man of
[19:46] their coast and set him for their
[19:50] Watchmen
[19:53] if if when he see the sword come upon
[19:56] the land he blow the Trump and warn the
[19:59] people then whosoever heareth the sound
[20:03] of the trumpet yes and taketh not
[20:06] warning if the sword come and take him
[20:08] away his blood shall be upon his own
[20:12] head
[20:13] yes he heard the sound of the
[20:18] trumpet he he heard the sound of the
[20:21] trumpet and took not warning his blood
[20:23] shall be upon him but he that taketh
[20:26] warning shall deliver his soul but if
[20:29] the Watchman see the sword come and blow
[20:32] not the trumpet and the people be not
[20:35] wed if the sword come and take any
[20:37] person from among them he is taken away
[20:40] in his iniquity but his blood will
[20:43] require at the watchman's hand so thou
[20:47] oh son of man I have set thee a Watchman
[20:49] unto the house of Israel therefore thou
[20:52] shall hear the word at my mouth and warn
[20:55] them from me when I say unto the wicked
[20:57] of Wicked Man th thou sh surely die if
[21:00] thou Dost not speak to one the wicked
[21:02] from his way that Wicked man shall die
[21:06] in his
[21:07] iniquity but his blood will require at
[21:09] thine hand nevertheless if thou want the
[21:12] wicked of his way to turn from it if he
[21:16] do not turn from his way he shall die in
[21:19] his iniquity but thou has delivered thy
[21:24] Soul amen thank God for reading of his
[21:27] word you may be seated
[21:39] we also turn to the Book
[21:41] of
[21:42] Revelation
[21:44] 13 reading from verse 11 Revelation 13
[21:48] reading from verse
[21:51] 11 and I beheld another Beast coming out
[21:54] of the earth and he had two arms like a
[21:57] lamb and he spake as a dragon
[21:59] and he exercised all the power of the
[22:01] first pce before
[22:04] him stop
[22:09] there amen so we know that we had a
[22:13] Watchman in this day amen amen God had a
[22:16] Watchman for the age yes amen and if he
[22:19] had a Watchman for the
[22:21] age and then there has to be people
[22:24] right now God has to appoint a people
[22:27] that will Echo the same same words of
[22:29] the Watchmen amen amen because why when
[22:32] the when the Seven Seals was open the
[22:35] Bible became a new book amen amenu and
[22:38] all the secret God had plainly declared
[22:41] to his bride amen and she is to Echo the
[22:44] same words of the prophet in this day
[22:48] amen but the Holy Spirit takes charge of
[22:52] his own word amen amen so those that are
[22:56] part of God those that are part of his
[22:59] program those that have the token in
[23:01] this hour those that have identity in
[23:04] this hour those that have representation
[23:07] yes because out of representation you
[23:09] don't have a body of there yes if you
[23:12] don't have representation you don't have
[23:13] a theophany yes that's why the Pharisees
[23:17] could hear the same words that Jesus was
[23:19] speaking yet they were holy people but
[23:22] they didn't have representation but the
[23:24] woman of the well an ill Fame woman she
[23:26] had representation amen because she had
[23:29] a theophany up there amen amen therefore
[23:32] you find in this hour God is entrusting
[23:36] Watchman amen yes and and and and a
[23:39] Watchman is not a normal person they
[23:41] entrusted to be spiritually
[23:44] Vigilant amen they called to have
[23:46] discernment in this hour they're called
[23:48] to take the same word that was given
[23:52] through the prophets and to to take that
[23:56] same prophecy and watch over over that
[23:59] prophecy that's what the Watchman is
[24:01] doing in this hour the fivefold ministry
[24:03] amen is to watch over brandom's prophecy
[24:07] amen amen amen yes to ensure that
[24:10] Brandon prophecy is coming to pass amen
[24:14] every other person is looking at the
[24:15] news every other person is looking at
[24:17] world events but a true Watchman is our
[24:21] as discernments amen he doesn't see
[24:23] things as just tomorrow for
[24:26] example is a Inauguration in America and
[24:30] everyone's looking forward towards it
[24:32] and they're expecting something great
[24:34] things to
[24:37] happen even the Christians in America
[24:40] expecting something great to happen
[24:42] because finally they they feel they have
[24:44] a president who is for them but State
[24:47] and religion cannot be together am
[24:50] history is repeating itself amen amen we
[24:53] already know in 1960 there was a union
[24:56] between aab and Jezebel yes amen that
[24:59] was told by The Watchmen amen amen when
[25:03] there was a union between aab and
[25:05] Jezebel and that Union hasn't stopped
[25:08] amen because
[25:10] aab right now when we are seeing aab
[25:14] speaking she's actually being the
[25:17] mouthpiece for Jezebel yes amen amen
[25:21] amen because what does revelation 10 811
[25:24] she exercised the power of the first
[25:27] Beast amen and now you're going to see
[25:29] it becoming
[25:32] more clear to you yes amen modern day
[25:35] events are made clear by prophecy amen
[25:38] now it's going to become more clear yes
[25:41] while the church world was excited we
[25:43] have a person that's going to
[25:44] accommodate us didn't that
[25:47] happen and didn't that happen in in the
[25:49] days of Constantine when Nero was
[25:52] burning Rome and blaming the Christians
[25:54] then came Constantine Constantine and
[25:56] said you now I will give now positions
[25:59] in the church I will now give you wealth
[26:01] I will now give you land didn't it
[26:04] happen yes when Pagan Rome became paper
[26:06] Rome yes
[26:08] amen amen so Watchman is required to be
[26:11] vigilant amen God has got Watchman in
[26:14] this hour to watch the hour that we are
[26:16] living in to watch the condition of the
[26:19] church to watch the condition of
[26:23] mankind and also to show ensure that the
[26:26] bride stay in cause amen because the
[26:30] bride is no longer in infancy amen there
[26:32] was a time when she was green she was
[26:34] laying in the presence of the son for
[26:36] all these years but now she's ripened
[26:39] amen and now she's in the fruit form
[26:41] hallelujah amen and now all this word
[26:44] that's in she's bubbling with his rivers
[26:46] of from this with this Fountain of Life
[26:48] with this inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[26:50] and she cannot keep quiet anymore that's
[26:53] why now she must prophesy again before
[26:56] Nations and tongues amen watching over
[26:59] the prophecy of brother brandham amen
[27:01] yes
[27:04] amen so she have to see deser the times
[27:07] of the
[27:09] times
[27:11] amen you know brother Bram had that that
[27:15] encounter he showed the symbol when he
[27:17] took the Rock and he threw it in the air
[27:20] yes and he said judgment shck the West
[27:23] Coast yes and he said it almost sunk
[27:26] Alaska yes and he said he didn't stop
[27:29] there yes so judgment as in God's
[27:32] impending judgment has been coming on
[27:35] and on yes until you even see now in Los
[27:39] Angeles with the prophet prophecy where
[27:42] he spoke that Los Angeles will sink she
[27:44] will go to the bottom of the ocean
[27:46] that's his prophecy that is thus say the
[27:48] Lord hallelujah and the message choosing
[27:50] of the Bride he says that amen
[27:54] amen but he said could it be the
[27:58] starting point of judgment because
[28:00] that's where all the full come yes the
[28:02] full come from Hollywood yes the
[28:05] influence from The Fifth Dimension
[28:07] working through the fourth dimension
[28:09] through Hollywood infiltrating homes
[28:12] infiltrating the whole world Amen and
[28:14] influencing mankind that's how demon
[28:16] powers were coming through the screen
[28:18] and through the high as they watching it
[28:21] demon powers were influencing man we're
[28:23] coming upon man and that's why you find
[28:25] that every fashion every train of every
[28:29] sin it comes from
[28:31] Hollywood
[28:34] amen but you find the great deception
[28:36] right now that's coming
[28:39] in amen because why religious power
[28:43] political power is all coming together
[28:46] yes
[28:49] amen and we know that we had we Gentiles
[28:53] had the gospel for 2,000 years yes
[28:58] now the gospel must go back to the Jews
[29:01] yes amen yes amen the only thing that's
[29:03] holding the Jews back from receiving the
[29:06] gospel is the bride amen the next event
[29:09] to take place is the voice of the
[29:12] Resurrection we are sealed up under the
[29:14] shouts hallelujah amen this bride is
[29:16] sealed up in the shouts amen which are
[29:19] the message going forth it seal Us in
[29:21] yes amen he said I will meet you in
[29:25] there amen and in there is sh glory amen
[29:30] amen where where you don't need light
[29:33] for man manmade light amen amen where
[29:35] you got God is the light of the city
[29:38] amen
[29:39] hallelujah because in there is the
[29:41] makeup of a pyramid City yes amen amen a
[29:45] p City that's going to leave the Earth
[29:47] amen and a p City that's going to come
[29:49] back to the Earth yes amen amen then
[29:53] Jesus when he left didn't he take a
[29:55] trail of all the Old Testament Saints
[29:57] with him yes just like that the body now
[30:00] the body of Christ is going to live in
[30:02] that form amen
[30:05] amen but we find that impending judgment
[30:09] is coming upon the
[30:11] earth and the next phase now the next
[30:15] phase will move from the from the the
[30:18] shout to the voice yes but right now C
[30:22] up under the shout is the hour where the
[30:24] foolish virgins will come and say give
[30:26] me some of your oil
[30:28] yeah but it's going to be too late then
[30:31] yes because that is the dividing line
[30:33] amen amen they had all these years to
[30:35] receive the Gospel they had all these
[30:37] years to get the baptism of the Holy
[30:39] Ghost
[30:40] yes amen they had good works they
[30:44] followed Church order and
[30:46] Doctrine they had good
[30:48] religion they were good
[30:51] people but they didn't have the baptism
[30:53] of the Holy
[30:54] Ghost they didn't have the oil they
[30:57] couldn't come into a union amen he takes
[31:00] a union amen there's an invisible Union
[31:03] that was taking place amen where there
[31:06] was Oneness he he said father may they
[31:09] be one even as we are one amen this
[31:12] Union is in such a manner where where
[31:16] the bride and Christ is so much alike
[31:19] that all you can see when you see her
[31:21] you will see the word amen amen because
[31:23] she's CH changing from flesh to word yes
[31:27] amen something that she bypassed she
[31:30] bypassed that theophany but she's coming
[31:33] to that amen and she cannot come into it
[31:37] unless she has that representation
[31:40] there that's why you find sometime you
[31:43] preaching to people you you're
[31:45] explaining them the word and they just
[31:47] can't see it they got to have
[31:53] representation not everybody has
[31:55] representation there not every every
[31:58] body has a theop there yes because the
[32:01] Bible says the rest of the Dead live not
[32:03] until a thousand years amen they come up
[32:06] in the white Throne judgment only those
[32:09] that have bodies will will go in the
[32:12] first resurrection amen who come in the
[32:14] first resurrection and those that are
[32:16] alive and remain shall be caught up with
[32:20] them so we find that the influence of
[32:24] Satan is now being manifested yes in
[32:26] laws M
[32:29] yeah in in legal
[32:32] systems in
[32:34] practices and you're going to see
[32:36] now the the the the this this this Beast
[32:41] Revelation 13 America the
[32:44] USA the system is going to now be an
[32:48] influence to the whole world yes and
[32:51] it's very easy for them because
[32:52] everybody trades with them yes and all
[32:55] they have to do is if you don't follow
[32:57] suit we'll stop your trade we'll raise
[33:00] taxes on the
[33:02] trade so you see that everybody now is
[33:05] lining up coming to trying to be close
[33:07] to this
[33:09] man but did God ask us to follow a man
[33:13] no the Bible says seek ye first the
[33:15] kingdom of God and his righteousness
[33:17] Hallelujah then all these things shall
[33:19] be added unto you we don't need the
[33:21] favor of man yes amen amen Our Father
[33:25] owned the CLE on a thousand years amen
[33:28] we don't want to we don't want to
[33:29] worship any creation we want to worship
[33:32] the Creator amen we are part of the
[33:35] creat we are part of him amen yes we are
[33:39] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen
[33:43] amen amen amen so that's why you find in
[33:46] this hour a good Watchman is not going
[33:49] to shun to tell you the full counsel of
[33:53] God Amen like in Acts 2027 he says for I
[33:57] have not shun to declare unto you all
[33:59] the counsel of God yes amen a good
[34:03] Watchman is not here to make you come
[34:06] together together and just have church
[34:08] he's got no time to play church amen
[34:11] yes the true five4 Ministry is our got
[34:14] no time to play church amen we don't
[34:17] want just a religious gathering yes the
[34:19] true five Ministry is yeah with a work
[34:22] to do amen and his work is to get that
[34:24] body into is to build up the body of
[34:27] Christ yes Amen to bring her into
[34:30] maturity in this hour to get her into
[34:32] that pyramid City Amen to make her find
[34:35] God's purpose in our life amen and to
[34:38] also wner about the things that are
[34:40] happening on the earth yes to W of Satan
[34:44] schemes a true Watchman is also one that
[34:47] will stand in the gap for the people
[34:49] amen just like Moses how he stood in the
[34:52] gap for the people the spirit of Christ
[34:54] was upon him a true Watchman will also
[34:56] stand in the gap
[34:58] yes
[34:59] amen a true Watchman will also want the
[35:02] bride against apostasy yes he will have
[35:05] discernment to recognize that if
[35:07] something is out of the
[35:09] word he have to you have true
[35:11] discernment to see that is not in line
[35:14] with the word that is your own opinion
[35:16] amen but that doesn't match up to the
[35:18] word it must be line upon line here a
[35:20] little there a little amen it must D
[35:23] together it cannot misplace it cannot
[35:26] mislocate amen
[35:28] you cannot misinterpret the word yes
[35:30] he's got to Be watchful over the things
[35:32] yes he's got to watch over God's flock
[35:39] amen so we find that God has called and
[35:43] set men apart to to fulfill this purpose
[35:46] yes now you find a
[35:49] Watchman firstly he's going to see a far
[35:52] off he got to have special eyes sights
[35:55] amen that's why you find the The
[35:58] Watchman of the age the prophet of the
[35:59] age he could see a far off he was a Seer
[36:02] hallelujah amen he was an eagle amen
[36:05] amen amen liken unto an eagle a prophet
[36:08] amen yes an arc cannot go where he goes
[36:12] it will disintegrates amen amen but this
[36:16] Prophet didn't just see beyond his age
[36:18] he took you to the back part of God's
[36:20] mind amen he showed you your Origins
[36:23] amen he showed you your origin and he
[36:25] showed you what you turn him back to he
[36:27] showed you the true purpose of
[36:29] redemption he's taking you back to an
[36:31] original condition
[36:33] amen
[36:35] amen that's why you find that you're
[36:37] living in a time where a man is so
[36:40] afraid right
[36:42] now that you know with all the things
[36:45] that happening they frightened hey can
[36:47] the economy
[36:54] fail can will the economy fail
[36:58] can we rely on
[37:00] anything we rely upon the word of God
[37:03] yes he said don't take thought of what
[37:07] food you're going to eat don't take
[37:09] thought of what clothes you're going to
[37:11] wear he said the spatters of the
[37:13] air amen God cares for them the lies of
[37:18] the field the tri Lord yet Solomon was
[37:20] not a raid like one of them yes
[37:23] amen so he knows the things that you
[37:25] have need of we are like upon Him amen
[37:29] amen so he says
[37:31] here the Watchman what he was the duties
[37:36] of the Watchman in the whole Testament
[37:38] The Watchman was the man that went up to
[37:40] a tower in the city way high he was
[37:43] higher than all the footmen because it
[37:46] was his position now in order for this
[37:49] man to get up there he must have a good
[37:52] clear understanding yes and he must have
[37:56] good eyes
[37:58] so he must have spiritualized amen he
[38:00] must be alert in other words he's
[38:03] looking at modern day events made clear
[38:06] by prophecy amen he must know the
[38:09] Stars so you must see God shows signs in
[38:13] the heaven when you seeing the signs in
[38:15] the heaven something is taking place on
[38:17] the earth yes that's why you find right
[38:20] now the stars are going to align during
[38:23] this week amen the sorry the planets are
[38:26] going to align themselves yes and if the
[38:29] the planets are lining theel the prophet
[38:30] said that's is there's a spiritual
[38:32] application to that yes am amen there's
[38:35] a spiritual application that God must
[38:37] show the sign in the heavens first amen
[38:40] so something's fixing to happen amen
[38:44] yes he
[38:47] says because it was his position in
[38:49] order for this man to get up there he
[38:51] must have a good clear understanding he
[38:53] must have good eyes he must be alert he
[38:55] must know the stars and many
[38:56] qualification
[38:58] had to be before he could be a correct
[39:01] Watchman amen now everybody likes to be
[39:03] a Watchman everybody likes to be a
[39:05] minister but to be a correct Watchman
[39:07] there's a qualification amen and there's
[39:09] a scriptural qualification yesen and I'm
[39:12] afraid today that we put some Watchmen
[39:15] in that couldn't see very far yes sir oh
[39:18] couldn't see all the disaster that's
[39:20] coming to w the people then unqualified
[39:24] a Watchman would soon have the city
[39:26] destroyed because the entire city
[39:28] depended on the Watchmen now don't we
[39:31] have a pyramid City amen this PID city
[39:36] is depending on the true Watchman in his
[39:38] hour amen amen hallelujah who is going
[39:41] to look at their interests is going to
[39:43] look after Brandon's prophecy over their
[39:46] lives amen I'm talking about your own
[39:48] prophecy what the Bible says about you
[39:51] your part of the prophecy your part of
[39:53] the scripture must be fulfilled it must
[39:55] be accomplished in this hour that's why
[39:58] you got Watchmen to watch over
[40:00] that
[40:02] Amen to ensure that the city comes to
[40:05] its position amen
[40:09] amen it
[40:12] says the entire city depended on the
[40:16] Watchmen God's Watchmen just like is in
[40:19] the Bible his Prophet was considered
[40:20] Eagles the eagle a would climb higher
[40:23] than any other bird a AR trying to
[40:25] follow an eagle with just disintegrate
[40:29] in the air he could never get there
[40:32] because the eagle is a special built
[40:35] bird for the purpose hallelujah amen if
[40:39] he wasn't when he went up his feathers
[40:42] would fall out of him did you ever try
[40:44] to pull the feathers out of an eagle's
[40:45] wings oh they great tough feathers
[40:48] because they bear the young ones on
[40:50] their on these feathers and they must be
[40:52] way
[40:54] high and they go and what good would he
[40:57] do do him to go up if he could couldn't
[41:02] have sight to see way off that's what I
[41:05] think today if we educate our ministers
[41:08] what good does it do to educate them if
[41:11] they have a spiritual Insight if they
[41:13] haven't got a spiritual inside to see
[41:15] far the coming and warning of the danger
[41:19] amen amen he's just like giving you your
[41:23] canary bird good wans to make good Wing
[41:26] feathers and
[41:28] and then keeping him in a cage what good
[41:32] what good does it do to give him vitamin
[41:34] what good does it do to learn of a God
[41:37] that
[41:38] was if it isn't the same today amen what
[41:42] good does it do to learn the Bible if
[41:44] you're going to deny all the power
[41:46] thereof it we must be equipped for such
[41:49] amen amen we're not talking about a God
[41:52] in history we're talking about the God
[41:54] in now what could we do to talk about a
[41:58] God that was but we want to see God in
[42:00] his people we want to see God made flesh
[42:04] again God dwelling amongst his people
[42:06] amen so that is that is what a Watchman
[42:09] going to watch over
[42:10] amen God in his people without denying
[42:14] the power
[42:17] amen so he says we have a Watchman a
[42:21] Watchman that climbed the rampants of
[42:22] Glory the Holy Spirit was sent back to
[42:25] Tower in men and woman amen who would
[42:28] believe God that's the Watchman amen
[42:33] hallelujah the the Holy Spirit sent to
[42:37] us as a
[42:38] Watchman that watches over us he is our
[42:41] Guardian the Holy Spirit was sent to
[42:44] lead man to be the Watchman of our soul
[42:46] exactly right man wasn't to watch one
[42:50] another it was the Holy Spirit to
[42:55] watch we don't need some manm amen it's
[42:58] the Holy Spirit working through the
[43:01] ministry amen working in his people amen
[43:04] he is the guide amen yes he's our tutor
[43:08] our teacher the holy spirit is to teach
[43:10] then we C to that to the Holy Spirit
[43:13] looking at his things Watchman what of
[43:15] the nights amen so the holy spirit is
[43:18] the
[43:19] guide
[43:22] amen so we know we can see impending
[43:25] judgments on the earth because you know
[43:27] the quote Pastor Adan just read speaking
[43:29] about Los
[43:30] Angeles where he says could it be he
[43:34] said where judgment will strike right
[43:37] here is probably where judgment will
[43:38] strike that's right he said let's get
[43:40] ready my this will probably be the first
[43:43] place it will hit amen right in here oh
[43:46] Church hold to God unchanging hand
[43:50] amen amen could that be the start of
[43:54] what's coming on the Earth right now
[43:57] because the bride is coming to her
[43:59] maturity yes is it happening because the
[44:02] bride is coming to her position now the
[44:05] bride is ready now she's forming this
[44:08] pyramid city is formed now yes where
[44:10] she's ready to walk like Enoch amen amen
[44:12] amen Hall she's ready because Enoch was
[44:16] in the pyramid she's caught up in the
[44:18] shouts amen
[44:21] amen she she sealed up in the shout amen
[44:24] which is the message of the hour Enoch
[44:26] was in the pyramid and he walked up that
[44:29] seven step and he left from there am
[44:31] amen beautiful she is the one that's
[44:34] caught up now in the shout she's sealed
[44:36] in hallelujah amen when she's sealed in
[44:38] nothing can take it away from her yes
[44:41] amen could it be that she's already
[44:43] sealed in and this is the hour where she
[44:45] is now ready to take a flight as we see
[44:48] what's happening on the Earth but there
[44:50] must be in between that time in between
[44:53] that shout in between the voice there
[44:55] must be the quick short work
[44:57] yes amen there must be the season of the
[45:00] quick short work he said short work amen
[45:04] hallelujah and it's a quick work amen
[45:07] where the bride recognizes who she is
[45:11] she becomes the invisible Invincible
[45:14] Army amen she becomes the super Church
[45:17] she becomes the super race hallelujah
[45:19] amen when she recognizes her position
[45:22] yes she recognizes her part of the
[45:25] prophecy she now works in perfect Faith
[45:28] because she recognizes her part of the
[45:30] scripture amen
[45:31] yes so you find that the Cry Of The
[45:35] Watchman has always been echoing through
[45:37] all the
[45:39] ages God always had a messenger in every
[45:41] age in this age he had a
[45:44] messenger but there must be one who says
[45:47] Thou must prophesy again before Nation
[45:50] Tong and king that's why the prophet
[45:53] came and he preached Revelation 10 1-7
[45:56] yes and he highlighted everything in
[45:58] Revelation 10 1-7 but he left out
[46:01] Revelation 10 8-1 amen for people yes he
[46:05] left it for another time yes because he
[46:07] knew that there will be a people that
[46:10] will receive that word amen there will
[46:12] be a people that will have
[46:14] representation that will believe that
[46:16] message that he bringing amen hallelujah
[46:19] it wasn't for the Pentecostal babes yes
[46:21] yes he was preaching among the
[46:23] Pentecostal babes and while he was
[46:26] fishing other the fish were coming in
[46:28] but he was fishing for that rainbow
[46:29] trout amen amenallah but when she comes
[46:32] in amen when she's the one that's coming
[46:36] in now she's going to be the one that
[46:38] will be echoing the same
[46:40] message out to Nations out to to
[46:43] individuals and they can discern the
[46:45] hour that they living in
[46:47] amen hallelujah amen and she can see now
[46:50] the modern day events made clear by
[46:53] prophecy she can see the Judgment signs
[46:56] she can see the sign of oncoming storms
[46:58] of judgment
[47:03] amen when the prophet threw up the rock
[47:05] there and he said Alaska almost sunk he
[47:08] said judgment didn't stop there and
[47:10] didn't we see from there earthquakes
[47:13] pestilences all the things around the
[47:15] world did we see rumors of walls yes
[47:17] then we see Matthew 24 being fulfilled
[47:25] amen find the
[47:28] world in this dark stage this L age but
[47:33] what he's done he brought people to be
[47:36] complacent the spirit of ly has gri
[47:38] people in such a way that people become
[47:42] to think that I have all I'm doing now
[47:44] every morning I got to wake up on the
[47:46] routine I just got to go to work I got
[47:48] to earn a living that's my
[47:52] life but what the Watchman is wanting to
[47:54] do which is the 54 minutes is showing
[47:57] you your
[47:58] position showing you your true purpose
[48:01] what you were placed on this Earth for
[48:04] why you are predestinated to live in
[48:07] this day why you are predestinated to
[48:09] live in this hour is to make a Rapture
[48:12] yes amen that's what you were kept for
[48:15] you wasn't kept in the day to be
[48:18] beheaded you wasn't kept in the day to
[48:20] be fed to the uh fighting
[48:23] Gladiators and fighting the FED to the
[48:26] Lions
[48:27] no you was kept for this day you was
[48:29] anointed for this hour and this is the
[48:32] hardest age because it's such a
[48:34] deceptive age
[48:37] sin everything is so complacent yes amen
[48:42] you you become so inre to this age am
[48:46] you got to work to make a living and
[48:48] when you are caught up in the work cycle
[48:50] of the system with your education system
[48:52] your working system that is Satan taking
[48:55] you away from God yes amen Satan does
[48:58] everything to take your time away from
[49:00] God take you away from your prayer life
[49:03] take you away from meditating upon God's
[49:05] word taking away from the things of God
[49:08] taking away from the purpose of God
[49:10] that's what Satan planned that is why
[49:13] God put Watchman in his hour to watch
[49:14] over you to to to make you to remind you
[49:17] all the time that you are you might find
[49:19] sometime the word is coming in
[49:20] repetition but the reason why it's
[49:22] coming repetition to remind you all the
[49:24] time that you are put here for a purpose
[49:27] you are put here because God anointed
[49:29] you in this hour God anointed you to be
[49:31] an eagle in this hour God anoint you
[49:34] with an eagle to overcome to fly above
[49:36] your circumstances not to be a slave to
[49:39] sin not to be a slave in Satan's eeden
[49:41] yes Lord
[49:43] amen that's why he he came and he spoke
[49:46] about that slave boy yes amen he his
[49:50] father was a king of the tribe yes and
[49:52] he knew and that when he leaves that
[49:55] place of slavery after his time and what
[49:57] is going to happen after his Jubilee
[49:59] he's going to live in the time of
[50:01] Jubilee at the end of his the Jubilee
[50:04] time Trump put blows he's going to leave
[50:06] slavery and he's going to go back as the
[50:08] King's son amen so what he did he knew
[50:11] now to fit into that place I got to
[50:13] continue as the king even though I am
[50:15] here yes oh yes amen did it stop Daniel
[50:20] in Babylon when Daniel and all was and
[50:22] shedrach mishak and those Hebrew
[50:25] boys when they they went as young boys
[50:27] but when they were trapped in Babylon
[50:29] they were trapped in the Babylonian
[50:30] system did it stop them from serving the
[50:32] one true God did it stop them from the
[50:35] prayer life did stop them from did they
[50:38] compromise they didn't compromise and
[50:40] bow down to any image foreign images
[50:43] they didn't need food sered to Idols
[50:45] amen because they kept all the
[50:47] ordinances that was given to them amen
[50:50] they still serve the one true God they
[50:52] were faithful in what they believed in
[50:54] so you are trapped in this latest year
[50:56] you are trapped in this world but you
[50:58] are not of this world Amen you conduct
[51:01] yourself as the son of the king the
[51:03] kingj because the Jubilee trumpet has
[51:06] sounded it is time that we go free to

[51:11] indeed amen that's why you you have the
[51:14] overcoming power to overcome every
[51:16] situation to every to overcome the fil
[51:19] of this world to overcome the situation
[51:22] where Satan wants to keep you Earthbound
[51:24] he wants to keep you slaving and slav
[51:26] and slugging for men yes and he he wants
[51:29] to take away your time one of the most
[51:31] precious Commodities that he can take
[51:33] from you is your time
[51:36] yes
[51:38] because we with our time it's whether we
[51:42] serve God or we can serve memory yes
[51:45] amen so there there's a responsibility
[51:49] on the blood of
[51:50] christen there's a responsibility on
[51:52] those that are sealed with the spirit of
[51:54] God Amen because our role is to Echo the

[1:01:27] will'll give into it
[1:01:30] yes because why everyone want to thrive
[1:01:34] and
[1:01:35] survive amen everyone wants the economy
[1:01:38] to work yes everyone wants to have that
[1:01:42] because eventually someone got to bring
[1:01:44] that Tre to Israel yes someone you know
[1:01:47] what he said Vatican owns all the gold
[1:01:51] yes but the Jews own the bonds yes and
[1:01:55] they have to bring it together they have
[1:01:57] to get them in and they have to come by
[1:01:59] a
[1:02:00] treaty so where are
[1:02:03] we amen we have got the title deep yes
[1:02:07] we are the rightful lers of the earth
[1:02:09] yes while they're fighting for land why
[1:02:11] they fighting for economy while they're
[1:02:13] fighting for power while they fighting
[1:02:15] for gold we are the rightful HS over the
[1:02:18] Earth don't you know the righteous shall
[1:02:20] sh up the ashes of the wicked amen this
[1:02:23] Earth belongs to us amen amen but not
[1:02:26] not this world condition not this world
[1:02:29] system not Satan no he's going to take
[1:02:32] us to the unimon while he makes it a fot
[1:02:36] place when he transforms it into a foot
[1:02:38] place we will come in that Millennium
[1:02:40] Reign amen hallelu and we continue to
[1:02:43] live here he's going to make it a
[1:02:44] suitable habitation for us a suitable
[1:02:47] habitation for the bride
[1:02:50] amenu so the next step the next event to
[1:02:54] happen for this bride is the voice of
[1:02:57] the
[1:02:59] Resurrection so bride bride of Christ
[1:03:02] Watchmen are warning Watchman is saying
[1:03:06] warning you of what's coming God
[1:03:07] impending judgment on the
[1:03:09] earth Gentile doors are closing
[1:03:14] in one of these days the gospel going to
[1:03:16] go back to the Jews
[1:03:20] yes this is not the time to play
[1:03:22] church this is not the time to come to
[1:03:25] the church for religion amen Lord this
[1:03:27] is not the time to come to church to
[1:03:28] satisfy your
[1:03:30] conscience or to please your family Lord
[1:03:33] you come to church you come to the house
[1:03:35] of God because you have a purpose amen
[1:03:37] hallelujah you are predestinated for
[1:03:40] purpose God has placed you here for a
[1:03:43] purpose amen that is to fulfill the
[1:03:46] purpose that he's created for your life
[1:03:48] where he's placed you in the body of
[1:03:50] Christ he's placed you in the body amen
[1:03:54] and the body needs one another every
[1:03:57] part of the body is needed that is why
[1:04:00] if you got a true revelation of this
[1:04:01] word you only just see yourself and your
[1:04:04] and your family you will see you'll see
[1:04:06] the entire body you will work for the
[1:04:08] body you want to do things for the body
[1:04:10] of Christ amen because you know this
[1:04:13] body each one needs the other each one
[1:04:16] cannot do without the other it's an
[1:04:19] entire city it's a perit city amen
[1:04:22] hallelujah
[1:04:24] hallelujah amen
[1:04:29] s so we find that God has shown us
[1:04:32] through the scriptures and through the
[1:04:34] prophet how he chose his Watchman amen
[1:04:38] and how he chose and why he chose the
[1:04:40] Watchman to war the people of the things
[1:04:42] to come and to to get the and if the
[1:04:46] people take eat to what the Watchman
[1:04:47] says then their own fath is Judgment but
[1:04:50] if they don't take he then the blood
[1:04:53] they have to face their own consequences
[1:04:54] for it but if the Watchman also doesn't
[1:04:57] warn them then the Watchman the blood of
[1:04:59] the people will be upon the
[1:05:01] Watchman but if the Watchman warns them
[1:05:03] that the blood is not on him anymore
[1:05:06] it's between them and
[1:05:08] God so it's on themselves so when you
[1:05:11] are being one of these things that are
[1:05:12] happening on the earth and the word is
[1:05:15] warning you of this time if the word is
[1:05:17] being spoken to you in his pure form
[1:05:21] without compromising he not being Cy
[1:05:23] coed to you and if you don't take heat
[1:05:26] to it then that becomes between you and
[1:05:28] God amen amen
[1:05:33] so we find that the message of the hour
[1:05:37] that we
[1:05:40] received is to bring us into the word
[1:05:44] image amen yes into the word image that
[1:05:47] we bypass amen Jesus didn't bypass that
[1:05:52] yes and Jesus had his theophany he comes
[1:05:56] as king theophany to M to he come mzd
[1:06:00] King theophan to
[1:06:02] Abraham and then he comes in flesh form
[1:06:05] but when the body is laying in the
[1:06:07] Tomb he goes into the in the theop form
[1:06:10] he goes to the souls that are lost in
[1:06:12] prison and now part of the third pull is
[1:06:16] also preaching to the souls that are
[1:06:17] lost in prison yes amen so you'll find
