[5:05] the word we can go straight to our
[5:06] scripture amen this morning I'd like to
[5:09] speak I may not get to the entire
[5:10] message but just speaking a thought
[5:13] called manifesting the life of Mark
[5:17] 11:23 to make it live amen amen now we
[5:20] know Mark 11:23 is the power of the
[5:23] spoken word that is only given to a
[5:25] certain class of people thank you amen
[5:28] it couldn't have come in any other
[5:30] age amen yes Lord hallelujah it couldn't
[5:34] have come at any other age any other
[5:36] time because it must come at the end of
[5:39] the age when Sons and Daughters of God
[5:41] are coming back into their position amen
[5:44] and only a certain amount of people can
[5:46] shine light upon that scripture and make
[5:49] that scripture live amen so we speaking
[5:51] on manifesting the light of Mark 11:23
[5:54] to make it live amen we'll read Mark
[5:58] 5:14 amen praise the Lord amen Mark 5
[6:02] and ver14 says you are the light of the
[6:06] world amen amen not you are the light in
[6:10] your own family not you are the light in
[6:12] your church you are the light of the
[6:16] world so you know that when you are
[6:18] depending on light you can't have stage
[6:21] one stage two stage three stage four
[6:24] load shadding yes if people are
[6:27] depending on your light you can't afford
[6:29] to have load sheding
[6:31] yes amen you are the light of the world
[6:36] because if you shut down your light the
[6:37] world is in darkness yes amen a city on
[6:41] a hill cannot be
[6:43] hidden neither do people light a lamp
[6:46] and put it under a basket instead they
[6:49] set it on a stand and it gives light to
[6:53] everyone in the house am Amen in the
[6:56] same way let your light shine before
[7:00] men amen amen in the same way let your
[7:04] light shine before men that they may see
[7:07] your good deeds and glorify your father
[7:11] in
[7:11] Heaven amen is everybody reading this
[7:14] and understanding it amen hallelujah
[7:17] it's Mark chapter 5 if you didn't get it
[7:20] in the same way let your light shine
[7:22] before
[7:22] men that they may see your good deeds
[7:26] and glorify your father in Heaven
[7:30] so the one that is Shining
[7:32] Light has Works following
[7:35] them amen yes amen the Lord had
[7:38] blessings to the reading of his word you
[7:39] may be seated amen hallelujah praise the
[7:44] Lord
[7:47] amen
[7:52] amen glory be to his name
[7:56] amen praise the Lord I'm just allowing
[7:58] you to settle down and allow the spirit
[8:00] of God to take control of the service
[8:02] right now because I don't want you to be
[8:05] distracted amen I don't want you to be
[8:07] distracted with anything forget about
[8:10] what will happen after the service right
[8:12] now we have come here for the word of
[8:14] God Amen and the word of God is light so
[8:18] if you're here in darkness the word of
[8:19] God can bring light to your situation
[8:21] bring Deliverance to your situation you
[8:23] may say well everything is going fine
[8:25] for me right now why don't you just
[8:26] preach a good cheerful message and we go
[8:28] on tomorrow you could be in darkness yes
[8:32] amen tomorrow the darkness of sickness
[8:34] could come over your body and you don't
[8:36] know where to turn on the light but let
[8:38] the word shine light upon you this
[8:40] morning that you'll know how to
[8:42] operate amen hallelujah amen praise the
[8:46] Lord the the reason why escom gives you
[8:50] load shedding they do not have enough
[8:54] reserves how many of you know that amen
[8:58] they don't have enough Reserve Reserve
[8:59] energy so they load shed to meet the
[9:03] demand amen so we want you to store
[9:06] enough Reserve energy so even when the
[9:09] demand gets great you are still able to
[9:12] meet the need amen amen amen amen amen
[9:16] hallelujah amen some of you need to
[9:18] switch your engines on this morning amen
[9:21] hallelujah amen amen hallelujah and get
[9:24] your faith Praise on get your Hallelujah
[9:29] on amen hallelujah amen get your best
[9:32] Amen on otherwise the Holy Spirit can
[9:35] only work in an atmosphere of Faith amen
[9:39] otherwise I'll be standing here this
[9:41] morning and giving you a good
[9:42] intellectual message you may even be
[9:44] blessed with it but there will be no
[9:46] life in it amen hallelujah so the
[9:50] prophet of God tells us what is light
[9:52] the Vindicated spoken word of God is
[9:55] light amen yes amen is he saying the
[9:59] written word
[10:00] only the Vindicated spoken word of God
[10:05] is what light is outside of that there
[10:07] is no light you can't lighten the Earth
[10:11] with
[10:13] flashlights amen it takes God's word
[10:17] that made manifest the son amen
[10:20] hallelujah praise the
[10:22] Lord now I'd like to background it a bit
[10:26] and take some types and shadows and show
[10:28] you amen in the Bible how when light
[10:32] comes it scatters all Darkness away no
[10:35] matter what the
[10:37] situation amen we can start with King
[10:40] David you know he's a young boy he's not
[10:42] even King as
[10:45] yet and his father sends him into a
[10:51] situation that even his father is not
[10:53] aware of because his father is sending
[10:56] him some cheese some bread some cakes to
[10:59] take to his
[11:01] brothers
[11:03] amen according to the civilians they are
[11:06] thinking that these are courageous men
[11:08] in
[11:11] Israel but they don't know the picture
[11:14] on the battle scene yes if they had
[11:17] known they wouldn't be sending cakes
[11:19] they wouldn't be sending cheese they'd
[11:21] be sending reinforcements amen they
[11:23] probably will be sending more military
[11:27] weapons but David father is revealing
[11:30] that according to civilian life they
[11:32] think that everything is fine and the
[11:34] Israel army is a powerful force to be
[11:36] reckon
[11:38] with so young David is sent to go to
[11:42] that Army but when he comes into the
[11:44] army he sees the armies of Israel are
[11:48] defeated by
[11:50] fear amen and if I could type it this
[11:52] way 200 million demons had possessed
[11:55] them and was let loose and were
[11:58] possessed the fullest Army but not only
[12:00] the Philistine army they had also
[12:03] possessed the Israel
[12:05] army amen you know the king of Israel
[12:08] Soul was possessed with demon
[12:11] powers amen hallelujah amen and we said
[12:16] that fear had gripped the Israel army
[12:19] but what is fear fear is a spirit yes
[12:22] amen and that spirit is demon powers yes
[12:25] amen the Bible says God has not given us
[12:27] the spirit of fear amen
[12:31] amen but of a sound
[12:33] mind amen hallelujah so no matter what
[12:36] situations we facing in life if you face
[12:39] it by fear you are already defeated yes
[12:42] that's right the moment you are
[12:44] presented with a challenge the moment
[12:46] you are presented with a situation be it
[12:49] amen your health be it your finances be
[12:51] it your job be it in your family or
[12:53] relationships whatever it is the moment
[12:55] you meet it with fear you are already
[12:58] defeated
[12:59] yes that's one of great Satan's greatest
[13:03] weapons
[13:06] [Music]
[13:08] fear and we find that he had possessed
[13:13] Goliath amen you remember it was Christ
[13:16] Through the Ages being
[13:19] portrayed so yeah was if we can say
[13:21] Satan incarnate in
[13:24] Goliath amen he had found a man to
[13:26] become incarnate in and he told call
[13:29] them slaves of an Hebrew
[13:31] God Amen if you can find one man to
[13:35] challenge me don't sacrifice your entire
[13:38] Army send one man let us settle it on
[13:41] the battlefield and whoever wins amen
[13:44] will be the winner of the
[13:46] battle amen what they were doing
[13:49] negotiating with the Enemy when the land
[13:52] belonged to them hello every promise in
[13:55] the book Belongs to You amen every
[13:57] chapter every verse every line there's
[13:59] no room for negotiations amen amen yes
[14:03] Lord a natural Israel wants to make a
[14:06] two-state uh party deal there they want
[14:09] to settle for Palestinian territory and
[14:12] they want to settle for Israeli
[14:13] territory amen but I want you to know
[14:16] that spiritual Israel will not partition
[14:18] the land will not divide the land amen
[14:20] he will take every bit of ground
[14:22] Hallelujah yes Lord thank you Jesus amen
[14:26] Wednesday we were speaking about
[14:27] strongholds and how to defeat
[14:29] strongholds amen and we showed you how
[14:31] Gaza means a strong City and that's the
[14:34] the contention right now the strip of
[14:36] Gaza and we showed you how amas means
[14:39] violence and how Jesus is saying that
[14:42] the kingdom of God suffered
[14:44] violence and the violent take it by
[14:46] force yes amen hallelujah we're trying
[14:49] to show you how the Christian life is
[14:51] not a Bed of Roses amen yes but it's a
[14:54] battle daily it's a battle amen you must
[14:58] overcome by the word of God Amen we are
[15:00] not saying that you're not going to face
[15:02] trials you're not going to face
[15:03] situations you're not going to face
[15:05] problems in your life but we are saying
[15:07] God has given us the word of God to
[15:09] overcome every situation to overcome
[15:12] every trial in your life thank you Lord
[15:15] amen thank you so we find
[15:19] here David is a man who's coming now in
[15:21] obedience to his father because we find
[15:24] the character there's a character
[15:26] required to operate in mark 11:2
[15:30] 3 amen it doesn't just take anybody to
[15:33] operate in this you have to be under
[15:36] Authority you have to know how to
[15:38] operate in obedience amen David was a
[15:41] man who was anointed by the prophet but
[15:44] he never moved ahead of God's time and
[15:47] season amen David never moved ahead of
[15:50] God's time and season even though he was
[15:52] anointed he didn't walk into the camp
[15:54] that day saying oh you old man you you
[15:57] backslid uh demon possessed people let
[16:00] me show you who I am I'm the anointed of
[16:03] God he didn't start to tell them that
[16:05] Samuel anointed him he was going to let
[16:07] his Works show forth who he was he was
[16:11] going to let his light shine before men
[16:14] amen amen I I I don't know if you're
[16:17] actually so interested in the message
[16:19] that you forgotten to say Amen this
[16:20] morning I don't know what's going on
[16:22] here amen hallelujah I don't know if you
[16:24] want to show the the visitors how well
[16:28] disciplined you
[16:31] are amen hallelujah amen amen praise the
[16:36] Lord Pentecostal people amen people
[16:39] filled with the Holy Ghost amen are on
[16:41] fire for God amen amen they are full
[16:44] with the Praises of God they full amen
[16:47] the praise can't stop from their lips
[16:49] amen amen
[16:52] hallelujah praise the Lord now I ask you
[16:54] to take the remote control that operates
[16:56] the gift and the anointing away from me
[16:59] and I put it in your hands and I tell
[17:01] you you operate the gift this morning
[17:02] amen yes amen yes Lord because if the
[17:05] gift is operating from the pulpit here I
[17:08] tell you it's going to be a fearful
[17:10] thing sword Blood Sweat and
[17:14] Tears amen hallelujah but if you can
[17:18] walk on the gift of God and say Lord
[17:20] speak to me according to my need you see
[17:23] if we if we come into the service not
[17:25] realizing that we possess the the
[17:27] ability to operate the gift that even if
[17:30] the pastor has another thought in mind
[17:32] another sermon in mind he can change the
[17:34] entire sermon and meet me at my point of
[17:37] need and we have testimony sitting here
[17:39] today how God is doing
[17:41] that yes amen amen look at our God case
[17:47] in point David was going to meet the
[17:49] need about some homemade food that would
[17:51] remind them about
[17:53] home but God was meeting another need
[17:56] amen God was turning that situation
[17:58] around yes Lord amen because of a man
[18:00] who was in obedience because of a man
[18:03] amen who was willing to walk after God's
[18:05] Own Heart amen yes he said I will not
[18:08] raise my hand against God's
[18:11] anointed amen so when he fire goes into
[18:14] this Camp he's walking into a very
[18:17] hostile
[18:19] situation he's finding the army of
[18:22] Israel trembling in their
[18:24] boots he's finding that they are
[18:26] possessed with fear amen but here's a
[18:29] man who's not swayed by what he
[18:32] sees here's a man who has ambition yes
[18:35] you young men you young women have some
[18:37] ambition in your life amen even our
[18:40] Prophet says I like a man with ambition
[18:42] I like a man with goals a man who knows
[18:44] what he wants amen yes don't just sit
[18:46] around idle saying oh whatever will be
[18:48] will be the first thing David asked the
[18:51] king is what will the King give the man
[18:53] who will slay this
[18:55] Philistine amen have an ambition
[18:58] Hallelujah he knew that in his current
[19:00] state and condition amen he couldn't
[19:02] raise his level of life in the Israel
[19:06] but he was going to find out what will
[19:07] the king of Israel do for me amen oh
[19:11] thank you and it seemed like an inviting
[19:13] proposition because he said he's going
[19:15] to give the King's
[19:17] Daughter and he's going to raise you up
[19:20] in the
[19:22] Kingdom amen hallelujah am amen praise
[19:27] the Lord
[19:29] know what you're fighting for is what I
[19:30] am Telling You Yes amen David wants you
[19:33] to know what am I fighting for what is
[19:35] the reward of all of this amen and we
[19:38] are finding out that the ones who
[19:40] overcome in this day and overcome Satan
[19:42] and all of his schemes there's a reward
[19:44] to the believer who overcomes and that
[19:46] reward you that overcome this latest and
[19:49] church age I'm going to make you sit on
[19:51] my throne even as I overcame and sat on
[19:53] my father's Throne that is the highest
[19:55] level you can raise up to give God
[19:57] praise amen
[19:59] yes thank you Lord to be seated with the
[20:02] King thank you Lord amen hallelujah
[20:06] amen yeah we find David now you know the
[20:08] story about King David and how amen he
[20:11] couldn't be equipped with what they were
[20:13] offering him amen military might
[20:17] military equipment military training
[20:20] amen he had to rely on his own
[20:24] experiences amen God has been taking you
[20:26] through experiences amen in your time in
[20:29] your season in the backside of the
[20:31] desert God has presented to you Lions
[20:33] he's presented to you bears and he's
[20:35] presented to you wild beast that were
[20:37] coming after your sheep but God has been
[20:39] preparing you the backside of the desert
[20:41] to face your goliaths amen
[20:46] yes amen so don't take the days of small
[20:49] beginning lightly all those afflictions
[20:52] you've been going through was test for
[20:54] you to move you to the next level amen a
[20:57] test is not if you in grade one they
[20:59] give you a test to promote you to grade
[21:01] two the test is not to fail you the test
[21:04] is to measure if you have learned what
[21:06] they have taught you and then to move
[21:08] you to the next grade so when God brings
[21:10] you through a test amen start rejoicing
[21:14] amen because when you overcome the test
[21:16] he's going to take you to the next level
[21:18] oh thank you Lord thank you thank
[21:21] you amen praise the Lord
[21:25] amen so yeah King David I'm going to
[21:27] move ahead in the story The only thing
[21:29] he told the
[21:31] king I need is a sling and some
[21:35] Stones yes
[21:38] amen we know the stone Stones
[21:41] represented the word of
[21:43] God Amen he took five Stones which is g
[21:47] r a c e he was going by
[21:51] grace and he was going by f a i t h
[21:56] Faith amen hallelujah

[22:02] Faith yes because he was using both
[22:05] hands amen amen he had a sling and he
[22:10] had a
[22:11] stone but David couldn't use the stone
[22:15] alone amen amen yes he couldn't use the
[22:20] word

[22:25] needed a sling amen that's sling types
[22:28] the Holy Ghost the sling types the
[22:30] Dynamics amen that must coming into the
[22:32] church what is the Holy Ghost to Prophet
[22:35] is the Holy Ghost is the action in you
[22:37] yes amen the sling is the action to
[22:40] propel the stone amen what is the Holy
[22:43] Ghost to feed
[22:44] of the word the Holy Ghost feeds on the
[22:47] word amen so God has been equipping this
[22:50] end time people with the word and
[22:53] placing them into a position where they
[22:55] have the power of the spoken word but
[22:57] you to require the Dynamics of the Holy
[23:00] Ghost to come and Quicken that word and
[23:02] bring it to life

[23:07] character required for this
[23:09] operation
[23:11] amen amen praise the
[23:13] Lord so David takes the sling and he
[23:16] takes the
[23:17] stone he takes the word and he takes the
[23:20] Holy Ghost and he uses both of
[23:24] it because the Dynamics must work
[23:27] together with the mechanics amen he
[23:30] couldn't operate with a sling alone he
[23:33] couldn't operate with the word alone he
[23:34] had to have
[23:36] both amen and has this as this gol is
[23:41] making threats to him what am I trying
[23:43] to show you in the midst of gross

[24:10] wondering what will happen to Young
[24:14] David all they heard was the testimonies
[24:17] about how he slew a lion and how he slew
[24:20] a bear they had never seen any physical
[24:22] evidence of it so they had to have faith
[24:25] to believe David's word amen they wasn't
[24:28] feeding David to
[24:32] Goliath so I'm showing you that David
[24:34] had a Ministry to build up their faith
[24:37] to believe in him amen that he was the
[24:40] manifested light yes and God was about
[24:43] to prove it in the midst of the Israel

[25:02] Goliath is telling him but yet David
[25:04] Rises up in faith something gets a hold
[25:06] of him and he says this day you've
[25:08] defied the armies of the Living God
[25:10] today I will feed your body to the fowls
[25:13] of the air and I'm going to take your
[25:14] head
[25:15] off amen David didn't even have a sword

[25:37] and you shall have it
[25:39] amen now I want you to know for those of
[25:41] you that may be thinking that David had
[25:43] some sort of word from the Lord David

[26:30] hallelujah praise the Lord amen so he
[26:33] needed mechanics and Dynamics and here
[26:35] he goes marching towards
[26:38] Goliath amen he wasn't ducking and he
[26:41] wasn't diving he was marching with
[26:42] purpose he knew was the manifested light

[27:20] per hour until amen it moved through
[27:24] every armor that Goliath had and it

[28:23] season amen amen praise the Lord amen
[28:27] amen wonderful thank oh he's worthy amen
[28:31] so don't let your light amen become dim
[28:34] Shine Your Light at all times amen amen
[28:37] we find here God in the beginning said
[28:40] what what was he
[28:45] doing God said let there be light so it
[28:48] must have been foggy dismal dark as the
[28:52] world was turning and when God knew that
[28:54] he had need of light what he said the
[28:58] seed was already in the Earth because he
[29:00] had planted it in there now he needed
[29:02] light to bring forth that seed to make
[29:05] that seed live because the seed was
[29:06] already there God has already put the
[29:09] seed of eternal life in you oh yes thank
[29:11] you Lord what we are doing through the
[29:13] preaching of the Gospel he shining the
[29:15] Gospel Light so that seed can germinate
[29:18] to life amen amen so no matter what
[29:21] situation you find yourself in how dark
[29:24] and how dismal condition you are you may
[29:26] be in sin you may be in unbelief it
[29:28] could be all dark and gloomy in there
[29:31] but let the light of God's word shine
[29:33] one time upon your heart yes Lord you
[29:35] will leave every denomination yes you
[29:37] will leave every man-made religion yes
[29:39] amen you will leave your worldly
[29:41] Traditions you will leave your smoking
[29:43] you will leave your gambling you will
[29:45] leave your alcohol and you will come and
[29:48] respond to the light amen Lord thank you
[29:51] because the seed can't help but
[29:53] germinate to
[29:55] life amen
[29:57] so God said let there be light amen amen
[30:00] now we know that God had to believe his
[30:02] own word and that's how light was
[30:04] manifested God had to believe his own
[30:08] word amen so God separated the light
[30:11] from the darkness what am i showing you
[30:14] there was time and season in the
[30:16] beginning God created the heavens and
[30:18] the Earth full stop we don't know how
[30:22] long that was but God waited for time
[30:25] and season amen something had happened
[30:27] that had caused the world to become
[30:29] formless void
[30:34] dark but God is waiting for time and
[30:36] season yes and he says let there be
[30:41] light Amen in the midst of your Darkness
[30:43] God is saying let there be light in the
[30:46] midst of your situation God is saying
[30:48] let there be light in the midst of your
[30:50] sickness God is saying let there be
[30:52] light in the midst of our unemployment
[30:55] God is saying let there be light yes
[30:57] Lord amen and that word has got to
[31:01] materialize when God said let there be
[31:04] light amen it wouldn't have meant
[31:06] nothing until it materialized until the
[31:09] light came forth striking through that
[31:11] Darkness amen and all Darkness had to
[31:14] disappear am amen amen so God's word is
[31:18] the one that separated light from
[31:19] darkness and the word of God made
[31:21] manifest always separate the light from
[31:24] the darkness that is why as soon as you
[31:27] accept the light of God's word as soon
[31:29] as you accept Jesus Christ as your
[31:31] personal savior you become the light of
[31:33] the world and all Darkness has got to
[31:35] separate all unbelief has got to
[31:37] separate all worldliness has got to
[31:39] separate because you have responded to
[31:41] lighten Lord
[31:43] amen if if darkness is still residing
[31:46] within you if there's still some
[31:48] unbelief within you you need to say Lord
[31:50] let the light of your word come and
[31:52] shine and take away all unbelief take
[31:54] away all Darkness from my life amen amen
[31:58] amen amen praise the Lord the reason why
[32:02] you know sometimes your mothers called
[32:03] you and they tell you open up the
[32:07] curtains open up the
[32:09] windows and let some light come into the
[32:13] room amen I'm telling you that you got
[32:16] some doors in your heart that are shut
[32:18] to the power of God shut to the light of
[32:21] God that's why darkness resonates in
[32:23] your
[32:25] heart yes but the the Holy Ghost is here
[32:27] the great enforcer this morning to come
[32:30] and knock at your door this morning and
[32:32] tell you open up yes Lord let me in yes
[32:36] Lord
[32:38] amen people can rise up with this that
[32:40] and the other but when the king light of
[32:43] the Bible the word of God Rises all
[32:45] superstitions denominational fanaticisms
[32:48] and things spread away and it shows just
[32:50] exactly what it is it shuts out all
[32:53] other light amen yes amen hallelujah
[32:57] that's what the word of God will do shut
[32:59] out every other thing shut out every
[33:01] false light yes amen amen praise the
[33:08] Lord Jesus said let every man's word be
[33:11] a lie and mine be
[33:13] truth amen so Jesus word we know is
[33:16] superior over man's
[33:17] word so we must always take God's word
[33:20] over man's word how many of us practice
[33:23] that in our life we always take can I
[33:25] see your hands we always take God's word
[33:27] over man's word and man's opinion and
[33:31] word come second to the word of God even
[33:33] if it means us losing friendship you
[33:35] know sometimes you get uncles in the
[33:37] family who everybody looks up to or
[33:40] sometimes you get a father figure in the
[33:41] family or somebody oh no we always go to
[33:44] this Guru when we need
[33:46] advice we must go to
[33:50] mama you know which Mama I'm talking
[33:52] about we always go to
[33:55] him amen so even if his word contradicts
[33:58] the Bible you always take Mama's
[34:00] word but the word of God must always
[34:03] have preeminence amen amen hallelujah
[34:08] yes amen the word of God Father's word
[34:12] is
[34:14] of highest value in our lives amen
[34:22] amen so here the prophet of God Will
[34:24] Tell Us in any age in each age God for
[34:27] told us what would take place in each
[34:30] age he says the only thing he needs in
[34:33] the manifestation of the light of God is
[34:36] the manifestation of the light of God
[34:38] upon the scripture to make it live for
[34:41] that
[34:41] age now let us sink in deep as much as

[34:53] also an algebra
[34:54] class amen so I need you to to catch
[34:57] certain
[34:58] truths so he says the only thing he
[35:00] needs is the manifestation of the light
[35:02] of God upon that scripture to make it
[35:05] live for that age amen yes God has
[35:09] already opened up certain scriptures in
[35:10] the Bible that could not be manifested
[35:13] in any other age except your age amen
[35:16] and you are the one that must light up
[35:18] that scripture amen you are the one
[35:20] that's got to bring that scripture to
[35:21] life amen let's put Mark 11:23 this is
[35:24] the focal point of our scripture reading

[42:26] spoken you're going to have what you
[42:28] have said
[42:31] yes amen praise the Lord amen I am
[42:35] telling you there's a special class of
[42:37] people to light up this
[42:39] scripture you know the prophet's
[42:41] experience when he was how hunting and
[42:43] how he couldn't understand the
[42:45] scripture and the prophet the Lord told
[42:47] him you come here to hunt the squirrels
[42:49] and there's no
[42:50] squirrels he says why don't you speak
[42:53] amen you know the story and now you
[42:56] began to speak and
[42:59] say I want a squirrel to come up this
[43:01] way go up onto the tree and stand there
[43:04] and as you spoke it
[43:06] materialized you see all we are taught
[43:09] from birth is to rely on our five senses
[43:12] see taste feel smell and year we are not
[43:15] taught when we in school that we have a
[43:16] six sense which is called Faith amen and
[43:19] we can operate like God because we were
[43:21] created in the image and after the
[43:23] likeness of God that God made us an
[43:25] amateur God over the Earth that he said
[43:28] you can have dominion he says multiply
[43:32] replenish the Earth and have dominion
[43:35] over the
[43:36] Earth amen how many of you believe our
[43:39] God is a god of multiplication amen our
[43:41] God is a god of multiplication right
[43:44] there in Genesis 1 he's telling you to
[43:49] multiply so a believer's voice when he
[43:52] speaks is a voice of multiplication come
[43:54] on now I don't think you're getting this
[43:56] amen this is your sunship Authority amen
[43:59] when you speak you operate under
[44:01] multiplication yes amen Luke 6:38 says
[44:04] give and it shall come back to you good
[44:07] measure pressed down shaken together and
[44:10] running over amen amen yes that's right
[44:15] Hallelujah you see in the Kingdom of man
[44:17] we have thought that amen hallelujah
[44:20] that 20 - 10 is 10 that's thinking
[44:23] according to the caral mind but in the
[44:26] kingdom of God if you have 20 and you
[44:29] give
[44:30] 10 it's going to come back to you
[44:34] multiplied amen amen it's going to come
[44:36] back to you hundredfold amen hallelujah
[44:39] yes praise the Lord
[44:42] yes right so 20us 10 in the kingdom of
[44:47] God is
[44:51] 100 I'm teaching you spiritual
[44:54] mathematics you don't believe me me did
[44:56] God have one son in John 3:16 God so
[45:00] loved the world that he gave his only
[45:03] begotten son amen yes now when he gave
[45:07] did he look like God was losing his only
[45:09] begotten
[45:10] son come on now did he look like he was
[45:13] losing his only begotten son but he was
[45:16] giving his son am but when God gives
[45:19] he's going to operate according to his
[45:20] own law amen God swld his own son into
[45:24] the Earth amen and it looked like God
[45:26] was going to be a loser because he only
[45:28] had one son but when this one son was
[45:31] swn into the Earth amen except a corn of
[45:34] weed dies and is sewn into the ground it
[45:38] abides alone but if it dies it brings
[45:40] forth much fruit so when this one son
[45:43] was given by God it says God so loved
[45:46] the world he gave his only begotten son
[45:48] that whosoever believeth on him should
[45:50] not perish but have everlasting life
[45:52] what was he doing sowing the one son and
[45:55] there was going going to come a
[45:56] multiplication of Sons and Daughters of
[45:59] God give God
[46:02] praise yes so our God is a god of
[46:05] multiplication amen yes amen hallelujah
[46:10] so don't ever think that when you are
[46:12] giving something into the kingdom and
[46:14] and in the Kingdom beside your tithes
[46:16] and beside your offering you can also
[46:18] give to your brothers you can give to
[46:20] your sisters but you are sowing in faith
[46:22] and let me tell you something you are
[46:23] reaping Eeps of reward and if coming
[46:26] back to you in multiplication when you
[46:28] give to the poor when you give to people
[46:30] that can't reward you the same way yes
[46:33] that's right amen that's correct amen
[46:37] when you can give to somebody who can't
[46:40] repay you
[46:41] yeah oh it's coming good measure pressed
[46:44] down shaken together and running over
[46:47] give and it will come back to you when

[46:55] love if you want peace you got to sow
[46:57] peace amen these laws apply on the earth
[47:01] and you can operate these laws you see
[47:03] they are laws of men and they are laws
[47:05] of God and only Sons and Daughters of
[47:07] God can tap into the supernatural
[47:10] laws

[1:22:53] humor Jesus had a sense of humor amen
[1:22:57] hallelujah amen God's people are happy
[1:22:59] people yes amen the joy of the Lord is
[1:23:02] our strength amen amen so sister Ruth
[1:23:05] amen just to share a brief
[1:23:06] testimony so it was in 2019 it was just
[1:23:09] before Co these Co demons were coming
[1:23:12] around and that she was diagnosed and
[1:23:14] she was told that she had a first AR
[1:23:17] attack many of you are aware of that
[1:23:21] amen so when the doctor she says when
[1:23:23] the doctor walked in and and told her
[1:23:25] that she had an heart
[1:23:27] attack she was smiling at the doctor and
[1:23:30] the doctor said you just had an AR
[1:23:31] attack what you smiling about
[1:23:34] amen and sister R told her I believe I'm
[1:23:37] already healed amen amen hallelujah
[1:23:41] power of a positive confession amen she
[1:23:44] didn't speak the negative and asked how
[1:23:47] many arteries are
[1:23:48] blocked she declared like we said Jesus
[1:23:51] said let there be light God said let
[1:23:53] there be light she said I'm already
[1:23:55] healed
[1:23:58] so when sister had the second heart
[1:24:01] attack after she says they did the
[1:24:03] second angiogram and the doctor said
[1:24:05] they had to do a triple heart
[1:24:08] bypass triple that means three of your
[1:24:11] main arteries are
[1:24:12] clogged amen and there's no way they can
[1:24:15] put a stint or blow out that blockage
[1:24:19] they've got to bypass that blockage so
[1:24:22] do an do an operation some of you have
[1:24:24] been through that you know what what
[1:24:26] they're talking about so sister Ruth
[1:24:28] says she always believed that God had
[1:24:30] his hand upon her
[1:24:32] amen and every time she went to the
[1:24:34] hospital to book an appointment for the
[1:24:36] bypass you all know sometime we were
[1:24:39] getting frustrated too they kept telling
[1:24:41] her they were postponing it this is not
[1:24:44] right that is not right we can't do it
[1:24:47] now
[1:24:49] amen but God is was in control am amen
[1:24:55] so when sister Ruth went this last June
[1:24:57] for a last
[1:24:59] appointment now in the interim you got
[1:25:01] to remember that the church was praying
[1:25:04] sister Ruth was praying you know many
[1:25:06] times we called here and we even believe
[1:25:08] that the Lord has given her a new heart
[1:25:10] amen hallelujah amen the lord gave
[1:25:14] somebody new eyes the Lord caus
[1:25:16] somebody's arm to grow in front of them
[1:25:19] yes amen when they cut the
[1:25:23] that soldier's ear off the Lord restored
[1:25:27] his
[1:25:28] ear amen but according to your faith
[1:25:31] what you believe if your heart is
[1:25:33] Damaged no problem God can give you a
[1:25:34] new heart if your lung is damaged no
[1:25:36] problem God can give you a new lung but
[1:25:39] you've got to believe God
[1:25:42] Amen so we've been believing that the
[1:25:44] Lord will give her a new heart amen and
[1:25:46] there's no need for the bypass so when
[1:25:49] she went for that all the x-rays and
[1:25:51] everything was clear
[1:25:52] this is last June now and they told her
[1:25:55] you don't have to go for the
[1:25:57] bypass let's give God praise
[1:26:00] amen so s's Thanksgiving is that based
[1:26:03] on that she wants to thank the Lord for
[1:26:05] her healing amen she says also I'm
[1:26:08] reading this here so you can see I'm not
[1:26:09] thanking myself here also would like to
[1:26:11] thank my pastor and the church for
[1:26:14] praying for me i' would also like to
[1:26:16] thank my neighbors for being there for
[1:26:18] me amen so let's give God a good hand up
[1:26:20] of Praise amen praise the Lord amen so
[1:26:24] our God has been moving for those of you
[1:26:26] maybe unfamiliar we've seen where God
[1:26:29] has touched and healed people living
[1:26:31] Witnesses sitting right here here's
