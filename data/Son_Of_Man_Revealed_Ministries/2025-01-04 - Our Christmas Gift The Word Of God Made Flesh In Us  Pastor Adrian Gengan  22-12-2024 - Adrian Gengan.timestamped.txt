[17:26] Matthew Matthew 1
[17:33] Matthew 1 this is how the birth of Jesus
[17:36] Christ came about his mother Mary was
[17:39] pleaded into marriage to Joseph but
[17:43] before they came together she found out
[17:46] to be with a child through the holy
[17:48] spirit because Joseph her husband was a
[17:51] righteous man and was unwilling to
[17:54] disgrace her publicly he resolved to
[17:57] divorce her quietly
[18:00] but after he had pondered this things on
[18:04] an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream
[18:08] and said Joseph son of David do not be
[18:11] afraid to embrace Mary as your wife for
[18:15] the one conceived in her is from the
[18:19] holy
[18:20] spirit amen he will give birth to a son
[18:23] and you will give him the name Jesus
[18:26] amen because he will save the people
[18:29] from their
[18:30] sins but Joseph when Joseph woke up he
[18:34] did as the angel Lord commanded him and
[18:38] embraced Mary as his wife but he had no
[18:42] Union with her until she gave birth to a
[18:45] son and he gave him the name Jesus amen
[18:49] amen the birth of Jesus for Qui and in
[18:53] the sixth month the angel Gabriel was
[18:56] sent from God the city of G named
[18:59] Nazareth so a virgin exp to man whose
[19:02] name was Joseph of the House of David
[19:05] and the virgin's name was Mary and the
[19:07] angel came in unto her and said hail
[19:10] Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with
[19:13] thee blessed art thou among woman and
[19:15] when she saw him she was troubled at his
[19:17] sing and cast in her mind what manner of
[19:20] salutation there should be and the angel
[19:23] said unto her fear not Mary for thou has
[19:26] found favor with God and behold thou
[19:29] shall thou shall conceive in thy F and
[19:32] bring forth a son and shall call his
[19:34] name Jesus he shall be great and he
[19:36] shall be called the son of the highest
[19:39] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[19:41] Throne of his father David and he shall
[19:44] re over the house of Jacob forever and
[19:46] of his kingdom there shall be no end
[19:49] then said Mary unto the angel how shall
[19:52] this be seeing I know not a man and the
[19:54] angel answered and said unto her the
[19:57] Holy Ghost shall come upon the and the
[19:59] power of the highest shall overshadow
[20:01] thee therefore also that Holy thing who
[20:04] shall be born of thee shall be called
[20:06] The Son of God and behold that cousin
[20:09] Elizabeth she had also conceived a son
[20:13] in her old age and this is the sixth
[20:15] month with her who was called bar for
[20:18] with God nothing shall be impossible and
[20:21] Mary said and Mary said beh hold the
[20:23] hand of the Lord be it unto me according
[20:26] to Thy word and the angel
[20:31] Luke
[20:32] 2:4 so Joseph also went up from Nazareth
[20:36] in gilee to Judea to the city of David
[20:40] called Bethlehem since he was from the
[20:43] house and line of David he went there to
[20:46] register with Mary who was pledged to
[20:48] him in marriage and was expecting him
[20:51] expecting a child while they were there
[20:54] the time came for a child to be born and
[20:58] she gave gave birth to her firstborn a
[21:00] son she wrapped him in swaddling cloth
[21:04] and laid him in a Manger because there
[21:07] was no room for them in the in the
[21:11] Shepherds and the angels and and there
[21:14] were shepherds residing in the fields
[21:17] nearby keeping watch over their flocks
[21:20] by night just then an angel of the Lord
[21:24] stood before them and the glory of the
[21:26] Lord Shone around them and and they were
[21:29] terrified but the angel said to them do
[21:31] not be afraid for behold I bring you
[21:34] good news of great joy that will be for
[21:38] all the
[21:41] people today in the city of David ex
[21:44] savior has been born to you he is Christ
[21:47] the lord and this will be a sign for to
[21:50] you you will find a baby wrapped in
[21:53] swadling cloths and lying in a manger
[21:57] and suddenly they appeared with the
[21:59] angel a great multitude of heavenly
[22:02] hosts praising and saying glory to God
[22:05] in the highest and on Earth peace to man
[22:09] and whom his favor rest when the Angels
[22:12] had left them and gone into heaven the
[22:14] Shepherds said to one another let us go
[22:17] to Bethlehem and see this thing that has
[22:20] happened which the Lord has made known
[22:22] to us so they hurried and found Mary and
[22:26] Joseph and the baby and was lying in the
[22:29] manger after they had seen the child
[22:32] they spread the message they had
[22:34] received about him and all who heard it
[22:36] were amazed at what the Shepherds said
[22:39] to them but Mary treasured up all these
[22:42] things and pondered them in our heart
[22:45] the Shepherds returned glorifying and
[22:47] praising God for all they had heard and
[22:50] seen was was just as the angel had told
[22:54] him amen amen
[23:02] thank you amen let's give him a hand for
[23:03] being good children and reading to us
[23:06] this morning amen the Lord bless you
[23:09] amen praise the
[23:11] Lord amen it's wonderful to be
[23:15] reminded about how the word was made
[23:17] flesh and there was such
[23:20] detail such Precision amen amen that God
[23:24] would reveal himself to so many
[23:26] different
[23:27] people and everything that he had fixed
[23:29] and planned he had written in the
[23:31] scripture amen and they were coming to
[23:33] pass according to the scripture amen so
[23:35] let's stand together for a morning
[23:36] message amen
[23:41] hallelujah we'll speak amen for a
[23:44] subject amen our Christmas gift the word
[23:47] made flesh in
[23:50] US amen praise the Lord I'm getting that
[23:53] from the message so before your
[23:55] religious demon gets powered up amen
[23:57] calm it down we'll read The Prophet's
[23:59] quote now I'm just taking his title amen
[24:03] praise the Lord our Christmas gift the
[24:05] word made the word made flesh word of
[24:08] God made flesh in us right and for sub a
[24:12] title I'll say following the Angel's
[24:13] message to find the word made flesh God
[24:17] has a pattern God has an order you got
[24:19] to follow the Angel's message to find
[24:21] the word made flesh amen so we're not
[24:24] looking 2,000 years ago for a baby in a
[24:27] Manger we looking how Christ is
[24:29] revealing himself through us now amen so
[24:31] amen we'll turn to our Bibles in Matthew
[24:33] Chapter
[24:36] 2 so they basically read if you were
[24:39] following the first promise in Genesis
[24:42] that the seed of the woman will bruise
[24:43] the Serpent's head and they followed
[24:46] Isaiah 7 Isaiah 9 amen coming all the
[24:48] way prophecy until it was fulfilled so
[24:52] God doesn't want to let his scriptures
[24:54] remain as promises written in the word
[24:56] only he's going to see that it comes to
[24:59] pass amen amen so in Matthew Chapter 2
[25:02] it says now when Jesus was born in
[25:05] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of erod
[25:07] the king behold there came wise men from
[25:09] the East to Jerusalem saying where is he
[25:13] that is born King of the Jews for we
[25:16] have seen his star in the east and have
[25:18] come to worship Him Now I want you to
[25:21] notice as we read not only are they seen
[25:23] a
[25:24] star they weren't just following the
[25:26] Stars amen praise the Lord Lord so they
[25:29] saw the star in the east and they have
[25:31] come to worship him when erod the king
[25:33] had heard these things he was troubled
[25:36] and all Jerusalem with him and when he
[25:38] had gathered all the chief priests and
[25:40] scribes and the people together see they
[25:42] forming together a council of churches
[25:44] now amen a Unity he demanded of them
[25:47] where Christ should be born and they
[25:50] said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for
[25:53] thus it is written by the prophet so
[25:55] they go to the
[25:56] word these are not just targ J us they
[25:59] are basing it on the word they're going
[26:00] to micaiah's prophecy right right amen
[26:04] amen amen praise the
[26:06] Lord now they're going to read the
[26:08] prophecy and thou Bethlehem in the land
[26:10] of Judah and not the least among the
[26:13] princes of Judah for out of thee shall
[26:15] come a governor that shall rule My
[26:17] People Israel then aod when he had
[26:21] privately called these men wise men
[26:23] inquired of them diligently what time
[26:25] the star appeared and he sent them to
[26:27] bethle
[26:28] and said go and search diligently for
[26:31] the young child notice now he's a young
[26:33] child because two years have
[26:35] passed and when you have found him bring
[26:38] me word again that I may come and
[26:41] worship him also and when they had heard
[26:44] the king they departed and lo the star
[26:47] which they saw in the East went before
[26:49] them till it came and stood over where
[26:51] the young child was when they saw the
[26:54] star they rejoiced and were exceeding
[26:57] with exceeding great joy joy and when
[26:59] they were come into the house they saw
[27:01] the young child with Mary's mother and
[27:04] fell down and worshiped him and when
[27:06] they had opened their Treasures they
[27:09] presented unto him gifts gold
[27:12] frankincense and more and being warned
[27:15] of God in a dream that they should not
[27:17] return to Aid they departed into their
[27:19] own country another
[27:21] way amen the Lord had blessings to the
[27:25] reading of his word amen you may be
[27:27] seated I want to read one more portion
[27:28] of scripture amen if you can find me
[27:31] Exodus 23 there brother amen praise the
[27:40] Lord we'll read from verse 20 it says
[27:44] behold I send an angel before thee to
[27:46] keep thee in the
[27:48] way because people want to get out of
[27:50] the way but the angel is going to keep
[27:52] you in the
[27:53] way and to bring thee into the place
[27:56] which I have prepared now which was the
[27:59] prepared
[28:00] place the promised land yes sir okay so
[28:03] it's going to be a
[28:05] journey he's not only going to take them
[28:07] out of Egypt but it's a journey he's
[28:09] telling them where he's going to take
[28:10] them
[28:11] amen beware of him and obey his voice so
[28:16] we are saying following the Angel's
[28:17] message to find the word made flesh so
[28:20] we got to obey the Angel's voice amen
[28:22] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[28:24] your transgressions for my name is in
[28:27] him amen
[28:28] Hallelujah yes sir and if we have the
[28:30] true revelation of his name now that
[28:33] name is still in the mighty Angel yes
[28:34] sir amen praise the Lord amen but if
[28:38] Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do
[28:40] all that I speak then I will be an enemy
[28:42] unto thine enemies and an adversary unto
[28:45] thine adversaries for my angel shall go
[28:48] before thee amen praise the Lord amen if
[28:51] we can put up the first quote there
[28:53] brother bradam in white out to be
[28:54] Shepherds he's closing his prayer and
[28:57] he's saying he praying in Jesus Christ's
[28:59] name we receive your Christmas gift what
[29:03] is a Christmas gift is he going to tell
[29:05] us Jesus in a manger but watch how he
[29:07] ends it we receive your Christmas gift
[29:10] the word of God made flesh in US
[29:13] am that's our true Christmas gift so
[29:17] we're not only rejoicing at the birth of
[29:19] Jesus we are rejoicing that Christ is
[29:22] now made flesh in us the true Christmas
[29:26] gift amen so if you a grinch rejoice and
[29:29] receive your Christmas gift amen the
[29:32] word made flesh in
[29:34] you oh yes hallelujah praise the Lord
[29:39] amen that's in the message why they to
[29:41] be Shepherds the true Christmas gift is
[29:43] the word of God made flesh in US sir
[29:46] amen so the key to walking in any of
[29:49] God's
[29:50] promises and living in the blessings of
[29:53] our inheritance for our day is to hear
[29:55] and obey the voice of the angel amen we
[29:59] can show you this in all three Exodus
[30:02] there was an angel leading
[30:04] them we just read in Exodus 23 the angel
[30:07] is going before them now remember also
[30:10] in type Abraham sending Ela to find a
[30:13] bride for Isaac is a type of the Prophet
[30:16] being sent to find a bride for the Lord
[30:18] Jesus Christ Abraham reveals that the
[30:22] angel is going to go before
[30:25] him amen that's right so in the first
[30:28] Exodus we find that the angel LED
[30:32] Moses amen and obeying the Angel's voice
[30:35] led the children from isra out of Egypt
[30:38] amen Into the
[30:39] Wilderness but even when the God won't
[30:42] let the promise stop short even with the
[30:45] unbelief of the people 2 million people
[30:47] disbelieved but God won't let the
[30:49] promise stay in the wilderness yes the
[30:52] promise was I'm going to take you to the
[30:53] promised land the promise is I'm going
[30:56] to take you out of this Earth whether
[30:57] you believe you're going to have a body
[30:59] change or not God is going to raise up a
[31:01] people who's going to believe in a body
[31:04] change amen hallelujah so even when the
[31:07] ministry changes from Moses to Joshua
[31:10] the angel of the Lord that was leading
[31:12] Moses is a still the same Angel of the
[31:14] Lord leading Joshua he said as I was
[31:17] with Moses so shall I be with
[31:19] you praise the Lord so we are not
[31:22] alone don't think that the prophet has
[31:25] gone off the scene and we are alone the
[31:27] angel of God is leading the church amen
[31:29] amen praise the Lord now we can't follow
[31:32] halfheartedly or
[31:34] unwillingly 2 million came out of Egypt
[31:36] and died in the wilderness amen amen
[31:40] because they refused to follow the word
[31:41] of God the instructions of Moses amen
[31:44] who was being led by the angel of the
[31:46] Lord amen now the Angel's message was
[31:49] going to take them through justification
[31:51] the prophet tells us death of
[31:53] wilderness it was going to take them
[31:55] amen through the Jordan which was
[31:57] sanctification
[31:59] it was going to take them amen onto the
[32:00] banks of the Jordan which was the
[32:02] restoration of the gifts but that's
[32:05] where the Pentecostal Church stayed with
[32:06] the restoration of the gifts amen but
[32:10] now we are coming into the promised land
[32:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[32:15] prophet is telling us Ephesians
[32:17] parallels Joshua so Joshua taking them
[32:19] into the Promised Land Is Us receiving
[32:22] going into the land of the Holy Ghost
[32:24] which is the message of the
[32:26] hour amen
[32:31] like as I was saying just a short while
[32:33] ago we can choose to allow the word of
[32:36] God to remain as a promise as an unted
[32:39] resource but unless the word is received
[32:42] by faith and made flesh by believing the
[32:44] word hearing the word recognizing the
[32:47] word and acting on the word of God
[32:49] because the Bible says all of God's
[32:51] promises are yes amen but it requires an
[32:55] amen yes it says all of God's promises
[32:57] is a yes and amen Amen brother Brandon
[33:01] was relating the story to at write as a
[33:05] yes but she said amen to the
[33:08] word yeah she didn't just leave it as a
[33:12] amen an audible testimony she connected
[33:15] with that testimony you see how when
[33:17] somebody else is sharing their testimony
[33:19] with you you can share in that
[33:22] blessing that's right amen hallelujah
[33:26] yeah we read the quot before the prophet
[33:28] of God was was telling us about how this
[33:30] woman was was hear amen she was
[33:32] overhearing some people talk badly about
[33:34] the prophet of
[33:36] God and she stood up for brother
[33:40] brandham and brother brandham amen the
[33:42] angel of the Lord came to brother
[33:43] brandom and told brother brandham
[33:45] because she stood up for you tell her
[33:47] she can have what she
[33:50] wants so the angel of God is hearing our
[33:53] conversations yes amen if you'll
[33:55] remember when when uh when brother Bram
[33:58] came to Durban South Africa and he he
[34:00] wanted the angel told him come to Durban
[34:02] but the ministers were just tying his
[34:04] hands and they had another schedule and
[34:07] they even told him brother brandham
[34:09] maybe the Lord will allow us to go into
[34:10] the permissive
[34:12] will and he says bully Paul came into
[34:15] the room and he told me Dad don't listen
[34:17] to that bunch of preachers brother Bram
[34:19] goes on to say that the angel of the
[34:21] Lord told him amen that's why he allowed
[34:23] him to see the angel of God he said
[34:27] because he respected Billy Paul for
[34:29] standing up and telling his father don't
[34:31] listen to those ministers the Lord
[34:32] allowed him the privilege to see the
[34:34] angel of the Lord so there's a great
[34:36] blessing and a reward amen if we follow
[34:38] the Angel's
[34:40] message amen amen amen amen so we are
[34:44] saying all of God's promises are yes and
[34:46] amen God's promises are positive amen
[34:49] and are waiting for you to say an amen
[34:51] yes sir so don't leave the promises of
[34:54] God on a printed page yes sir amen all
[34:56] of the promises of God in the scriptures
[34:59] must be that must be fulfilled today by
[35:01] the bride must be brought to life by
[35:03] allowing his word to manifest in US amen
[35:06] don't leave healing of your body to
[35:08] remain a promise in the word believe the
[35:10] promise of the word that he was wounded
[35:11] for our transgression Bru from our
[35:14] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[35:16] was upon him and by his stripes we were
[35:19] healed amen even now you can receive it
[35:22] amen don't leave amen don't be in lack
[35:25] Jehovah Gyra is here amen we can make a
[35:27] claim and withdraw from the bank of
[35:29] Heaven even this morning Our Father HS a
[35:32] cattle on a thousand hills amen we are
[35:34] the children of Abraham amen and we are
[35:36] blessed with faithful Abraham we can't

[36:11] your life amen you don't always have to
[36:14] be amen somebody who's just getting
[36:16] along with Meer fa amen believe that God
[36:19] has called you for this hour believe
[36:21] that God has anointed you for this hour
[36:23] believe Amen in the promises of
[36:26] yourself amen
[36:28] yes sir it's easy to believe somebody
[36:30] else's promises it's easy to believe
[36:32] that Malachi 4 Prophet was William Bram
[36:35] it's easy to believe you as Revelation
[36:36] 10 but that's believing the scripture of
[36:38] somebody else how about believing the
[36:41] scripture of your day that God is
[36:43] Anointed you if he calls you he equips
[36:45] you amen if he calls you he anoints
[36:49] you you are called in Revelation 10 to
[36:52] take the book so he's not going to leave
[36:53] you unequipped he's not going to leave
[36:56] you a not anointing
[36:58] he's going to equip you and he's going
[36:59] to anoint you that is why the final part
[37:01] of Revelation 10 is telling you go and
[37:03] prophesy again you must know that this
[37:05] bride is highly anointed amen highly
[37:08] gifted highly revelated Amen to sound a
[37:11] word of Prophecy
[37:13] amen amen don't be bound by
[37:16] circumstances Jesus has broken Every
[37:18] Chain Every Chain of depression Every
[37:20] Chain of anxiety Every Chain amen of
[37:23] every Circumstance the Bible says he
[37:25] whom the son of man has set free is free
[37:28] indeed amen yes sir amen salvation is
[37:32] free also we can allow that word to
[37:34] remain untapped amen but Salvation is a
[37:36] free gift of God the Bible says for God
[37:39] so loved the world that he gave his only
[37:41] begotten son that whosoever believeth on
[37:43] him should not perish but have
[37:45] everlasting life that's right but people
[37:47] don't want to believe in the sun yeah
[37:50] hallelujah amen
[37:54] amen now we find we were talking about
[37:56] such detail man talking about how the
[37:58] angel of God was was so instrumental in
[38:02] that first coming of Jesus
[38:04] Christ if you were so instrumental in
[38:07] the first coming don't you think he
[38:08] would be instrumental in the second
[38:10] coming right amen amen praise the Lord
[38:14] MH hallelujah amen yeah we find
[38:18] ourselves amen yeah amen even as one of
[38:21] the brothers were reading there about
[38:23] how the Angels Came to the
[38:25] Shepherds but notice how many people the
[38:27] came to he came to the father of John
[38:30] the Baptist
[38:32] Zechariah to reveal to him that he was
[38:35] going to have a son yes and his name was
[38:37] going to be
[38:39] John amen
[38:41] hallelujah he he comes to
[38:44] Mary to reveal Amen to her that she's
[38:48] going to conceive and bear a
[38:52] son then he comes to Joseph in a dream
[38:56] so don't don't question now the angel of
[38:58] God
[38:59] Appears because in the Bible you're
[39:01] reading that the angel of God can appear
[39:03] to Joseph in a dream amen and the angel
[39:06] of God can appear to you in a
[39:08] dream Hallelujah you can get a physical
[39:12] visitation you can get him in a
[39:15] dream amen
[39:18] hallelujah and you can also hear him by
[39:21] hearing the testimony of the
[39:23] Shepherds Hall praise the Lord but you
[39:26] are still from the
[39:29] angel praise the Lord so the angel comes
[39:33] to Zechariah Angel comes to Mary Angel
[39:36] comes to Joseph and the angel comes to
[39:38] the shepherds in the field praise the
[39:40] Lord amen the most unlikely place now
[39:43] notice even scripture must be fulfilled
[39:46] because Jesus is not in
[39:48] Nazareth yet he's still in the womb of
[39:50] his mother but Moses I mean Joseph and
[39:52] Mary are not in
[39:54] Bethlehem they need to get into an
[39:56] environment oh yes they need to get into
[39:59] their
[40:00] position their scriptural identification
[40:03] oh yes they need to leave the city that
[40:05] they are in amen so God raises up amen
[40:08] attacks yes
[40:10] sir God will raise up circumstances in
[40:13] your life to either get you to the place
[40:15] where you need to be or stop you from
[40:17] being going to that place hello are you
[40:20] are you oh come on now are you following
[40:22] the voice of God or are you just going
[40:25] after the dictates of your own heart God
[40:26] will raise up a circumstance amen so
[40:28] that you can see that sign don't be a ba
[40:30] him now yeah amen yes sir
[40:36] amen if God is going to lead you
[40:38] somewhere
[40:39] amen and he's raising up red flags all
[40:42] over don't go any
[40:45] further Hallelujah don't go with a
[40:47] crushed leg like bam trying to get to
[40:50] the back part of Israel and trying to
[40:52] curse Israel every time he tried to
[40:54] curse he blessed
[40:57] hallelujah
[40:59] amen now God needs to get them to
[41:02] Bethlehem why amen they need to get to
[41:05] the house of God's bread Hallelujah they
[41:08] need amen because maybe preparation I'm
[41:11] just it's not written in the Bible but
[41:13] I'm saying maybe the fancy preparations
[41:16] of jesus' birth were already made in
[41:19] Nazareth maybe they had the crib yeah
[41:23] they had all the fine
[41:25] clothes but by raising up the taxes they
[41:28] must go to their
[41:30] City God took away all their preparation
[41:34] yeah because that was not the place
[41:36] where they supposed to be born Jesus was
[41:38] supposed to be born so they couldn't
[41:40] travel with a crib they couldn't travel
[41:42] with their
[41:45] pram sir they couldn't travel with all
[41:47] of these
[41:48] things they had to just pick up their
[41:50] stuff and get to Bethlehem when they got
[41:53] to Bethlehem they didn't even have a
[41:56] reservation amen Brothers think about
[41:58] what a beautiful conversation you have
[42:01] had with your
[42:03] [Music]
[42:06] wife amen hallelujah there would have
[42:09] been intense moments of
[42:13] Fellowship oh yes praise the Lord amen
[42:17] because now he's taking her the Bible
[42:19] says there was no room in the end so he
[42:22] took her to a
[42:24] Manger Hallelujah
[42:29] and there Jesus POS the Lord God
[42:32] positioned them to be born there in that
[42:34] place why God needed them to be in that
[42:37] position in that location to fulfill the
[42:39] scripture but also to be in position so
[42:42] that the Angels who were nearby in the
[42:44] field sorry the Shepherds that were
[42:47] nearby in the field could also connect
[42:50] with this
[42:51] word amen yes sir the prover of God says
[42:56] for the first time now amen the message
[42:58] would come to an unlikely
[43:00] place and he says could it be again that
[43:03] the message would come to an unlikely
[43:05] group and unlikely
[43:08] people amen hallelujah a place that
[43:11] people don't think much of us amen he
[43:14] says could it be that we'll find him in
[43:15] this unlikely group of people in this
[43:17] unlikely place amen Shepherds will know
[43:20] nothing about
[43:22] theology praise the Lord bypass all the
[43:25] Nobles bypass the clergymen bypass all
[43:27] the somebodies and reveal it to nobody's
[43:31] amen amen that's why they ask the
[43:33] question do you mean God would bypass J
[43:36] of Roland and reveal it to
[43:39] you they can't understand it it's not
[43:43] meant to be understood with the human
[43:45] mind you mean God would bypass Fred
[43:48] Roberts God would bypass bully Graham or
[43:51] Roberts and all of these great minds and
[43:54] reveal it to you that William brandom is
[43:57] Mali 4:5 and 6 and he is revelation 10:7
[44:00] to bring you a
[44:02] word to reveal to you the hidden
[44:04] mysteries of
[44:06] redemption amen praise the Lord amen
[44:10] amen so the Lord would bring the
[44:12] greatest message that there ever was
[44:15] amen imagine for 4,000 years they had
[44:18] waited for this promise but the greatest
[44:20] message that Messiah is on the earth now
[44:23] was revealed to
[44:25] Shepherds amen praise the Lord amen God
[44:29] takes noodies and makes them somebodies
[44:32] God can take nothing and make it
[44:34] something amen amen so we've got to
[44:37] strip ourselves of our own abilities and
[44:40] say God I'm depending on your ability
[44:42] amen praise the Lord now notice amen the
[44:46] these angel I mean the
[44:51] Shepherds these Shepherds were
[44:54] not non-religious people
[44:59] yes they believe the Angel's message
[45:02] which showed you equality about
[45:05] them amen they had the ability to hear
[45:08] the angel's voice and to receive that
[45:11] word from the angel so amen imagine now
[45:14] amen at the speed of light brother
[45:16] Brandon says those Angels
[45:20] Came amen came there to the shepherds in
[45:23] the field and announcing amen glory to
[45:27] God in the highest peace on Earth and
[45:30] Good Will towards all men for in this
[45:32] day in the city of Jerusalem is Born To
[45:35] You Christ the Lord amen hallelujah he
[45:38] says what a message Amen to receive what
[45:41] a declaration he says for the first time
[45:44] the man had heard the angel
[45:47] sing the first group of people that
[45:49] heard Angelic voices amen singing was a
[45:52] bunch of shepherds
[45:55] amen Hall praise the Lord
[45:59] amen and the prophet of God here in this
[46:02] message why there to be Bethlehem says
[46:04] they found him in the message they found
[46:07] this message of the messenger in the
[46:08] manger exactly where the angel said it
[46:11] would be now notice they go and they
[46:14] follow the Angel's
[46:17] message to see if it is
[46:20] true so they don't leave that promise
[46:23] unfulfilled they go to the manger and
[46:25] they go to find Jesus
[46:29] hallelujah praise the
[46:31] Lord who was reading about uh the
[46:34] Shepherds here brother Caleb or Matthew
[46:37] somebody was reading about the Shepherds
[46:39] you can I have that piece of paper amen
[46:42] praise the
[46:43] Lord Glory I want you to find something
[46:46] here I don't want to take too long to go
[46:49] and find it I I already printed this out
[46:51] so I'd rather find it
[46:53] here let's go the Amen in uh The Book of
[46:56] Luke chap
[47:01] 2 Luke chap
[47:04] 2:15 it says when the angel had left
[47:07] them and gone into heaven the Shepherds
[47:09] said to one
[47:11] another amen so after you receive an an
[47:15] Supernatural experience there's still a
[47:17] part that you must do yes are you going
[47:21] to get into
[47:23] action or are you just going to listen
[47:25] to the word
[47:27] they said to one another let us now go
[47:31] even unto
[47:32] Bethlehem and see the thing which is
[47:34] come to pass which the Lord had made
[47:36] known unto
[47:38] us there's a part for us to
[47:41] play so they hurried off and found Mary
[47:44] and Joseph and the baby who was lying in
[47:46] the
[47:47] manger after amen so they came with the
[47:50] a amen next verse and when they had seen
[47:53] it they had made known abroad the S
[47:56] which was told told them concerning this
[47:58] child they didn't remain quiet the Bible
[48:02] says that the Shepherds made known
[48:04] abroad they extended the borders of
[48:06] their
[48:07] prophecy amen
[48:10] hallelujah you say but how could these
[48:12] Shepherds leave the 99
[48:16] sheep the Shepherds left the 99 sheep
[48:19] and they going and sounding the message
[48:21] abroad who are taking care of the
[48:24] sheep praise the Lord amen these men
[48:28] amen left the 99 to go seeking the one
[48:31] true Lamb of God amenah Amen they left
[48:35] 99 to find the
[48:37] one amen amen praise the Lord thank you
[48:42] not one that is
[48:43] lost but the one amen that was never
[48:47] lost amen the perfect Lamb of God yes
[48:50] they went to seek that one amen not one
[48:54] that needs saving but the one that had
[48:56] come to save yes praise the Lord not the
[48:59] one that wonders through creation but
[49:01] the one that's the Wonder of
[49:04] creation amen we should always be
[49:06] willing to leave 99 things on our to-do
[49:09] list and seek the one true Lamb of God
[49:13] Amen thank you Lord praise the Lord amen
[49:17] let's read now they made known abroad
[49:19] the saying which was told them
[49:21] concerning the child amen and all they
[49:24] that heard it wondered that those things
[49:27] which were told him by the Shepherds
[49:30] praise the Lord amen but Mary kept all
[49:33] these things and ped them in a heart so
[49:36] the Shepherds started a Ministry they
[49:38] started to go everywhere telling them
[49:40] Messiah is on the earth now am I'd like
[49:45] to believe that they sounded that
[49:46] ministry right throughout
[49:49] Judea right throughout Jerusalem and
[49:52] Bethlehem amen they sounded it to
[49:54] everyone who would hear the Bible is
[49:56] clear they sounded it abroad and
[49:58] everyone who heard marveled at this word
[50:01] amen amen amen so the Shepherds have a
[50:05] work to do the Shepherds know where to
[50:08] find the word made
[50:10] flesh amen the Shepherds can identify
[50:13] the lamb the Shepherds can get into a
[50:15] Manger amen amen though it be amen a
[50:19] stinking
[50:20] manger though it be a hard word the true
[50:24] Shepherds can go into those places
[50:28] and identify the word made flesh
[50:31] amen you know how brother brand would
[50:33] dramatize it can you imagine Kus the
[50:36] high priest going into that manger he
[50:38] said he would have turned up his nose at
[50:39] the
[50:40] stench can you imagine the scribes and
[50:42] the Pharisees they wouldn't have had not
[50:44] want to have nothing to do with that
[50:47] manger praise the
[50:48] [Music]
[50:50] Lord
[50:55] amen but but can you imagine the joy in
[50:57] their heart when they found Jesus
[51:00] because the angel had given them the
[51:01] message and it was exactly as the angel
[51:04] said I'm driving this point for a
[51:06] purpose right right amen because just
[51:10] like how the angel LED them in the first
[51:12] Exodus the angel was now leading in the
[51:14] second exodus yes sir amen but the angel
[51:17] wasn't just going to leave them to find
[51:19] the word made
[51:20] flesh the Fulfillment of the Angel's
[51:23] message would come on Acts chapter 2
[51:25] amen when the Holy Ghost would come down
[51:28] amen God didn't just want to be with
[51:30] them but God wanted to be in them in the
[51:33] first Exodus it was God above them in
[51:35] the second Exodus it was God with them
[51:37] amen but on the day of Pentecost it was
[51:40] God in
[51:42] them praise the Lord
[51:45] amen so God knows where to send his
[51:47] message God knows how to change the
[51:49] environment Amen to let the word be made
[51:52] flesh in your
[51:53] [Music]
[51:54] life amen amen so God had to bring the
[51:58] word into the shepherd's environment he
[52:00] says when the Shepherds heard the
[52:01] Messiah was on Earth and came into his
[52:03] presence right in their own environment
[52:05] and found the message to be true was
[52:08] Vindicated there how it must have made
[52:10] those men feel to find that God had done
[52:12] this great thing of them
[52:15] amen so that's the shepherd's message
[52:18] amen that Messiah is on the earth
[52:22] now praise the
[52:24] Lord amen
[52:27] so we we can see now that following the
[52:30] angel the Angel's voice will lead you to
[52:33] the promised word to the word made
[52:37] flesh
[52:40] Hallelujah along the way you're going to
[52:41] get naysayers along the way you're going
[52:44] to get people that tell you the land is
[52:46] filled with giants but there's also
[52:49] evidence of milk and an amen they're
[52:51] carrying grapes
[52:55] amen amen amen so watch what voice you
[52:58] are listening to because 12 Spies were
[53:02] sent to Canaan one from each
[53:05] tribe but 10 came back with an evil
[53:09] report that we are not able to take the
[53:11] land but only two said we are more than
[53:14] able amen hallelujah that was Joshua and
[53:18] Caleb praise the Lord so we find
[53:21] included in the story is the specifics
[53:23] of the Angel's visitation finding Jesus
[53:26] rep in a Manger in swaddling cloths the
[53:28] angel LED them to the word made
[53:31] flesh so I'm driving that for a point
[53:34] now because we're going to come to the
[53:35] Highlight where the angel is now driving
[53:39] us to find the word made flesh in our
[53:41] lives if we don't see the word made
[53:44] flesh in our lives there is no Rapture
[53:46] that's
[53:47] right
[53:49] amen amen amen let's come to our own
[53:52] manger this morning
[53:57] praise the Lord amen the angel LED them
[54:01] amen the angel of God in this day is not
[54:03] going to lead you to A Jesus in a manger
[54:06] but to A Jesus in bright
[54:08] form cuz Jesus is now revealing himself
[54:10] through you and
[54:11] I so we have a parallel to the first
[54:14] coming in the second coming of Jesus
[54:17] John was the Forerunner of the first
[54:18] coming William Bram was a forerunner of
[54:21] the second
[54:22] coming John turned the hearts of the
[54:24] fathers to the children William br turn
[54:26] the heart of the children to the fathers
[54:29] amen amen praise the Lord now we know
[54:32] that Jesus came to redeem us by paying
[54:34] the price with his own blood he ascends
[54:36] to us to intercede for 2,000 years amen
[54:39] he's making
[54:41] intercession to those names that were
[54:43] written in the book from before the
[54:44] foundation of the world
[54:46] amen amen and Revelation 5 he takes back
[54:49] the title deed to man's Redemption and
[54:51] in Revelation 10 he brings it back to
[54:53] the Earth amen he brings man the
[54:57] original amen inheritance to take man
[55:00] back to the original condition bringing
[55:02] them back to fellowship bringing them
[55:04] back to Dominion bringing them back to
[55:06] eternal life and eternal life requires a
[55:08] new body I can't have eternal life in
[55:11] this body so God is going to change this
[55:14] body amen we shall be changed I say we
[55:17] shall be changed we shall be changed
[55:21] amen changed from Mortal to immortality
[55:24] in the twinkling of an eye
[55:26] praise the Lord amen so John pointed
[55:29] them to the word made
[55:33] flesh he says Behold the Lamb of God who
[55:36] takes away the sins of the world John
[55:39] the first Forerunner pointed them to the
[55:42] word made flesh
[55:45] Jesus ran and pointed Amen to a word
[55:49] born a word formed bride sir he always
[55:53] prophesied about this bride
[55:57] because John the Baptist was amen a
[56:00] forerunner of the
[56:03] head yes I want you to get
[56:06] this Jesus Christ and his bride are one
[56:09] body one unit John was Pro was was a
[56:13] forerunner of the head William Brandon
[56:16] was the Forerunner amen of the body of
[56:19] Christ praise the Lord amen calm your
[56:22] religious demon down we read the quote
[56:24] now amen praise the Lord amen
[56:28] this formation of the word born bride
[56:30] was a
[56:31] process now we know we the word born
[56:34] bride just didn't come about yes sir
[56:38] because we know amen that the ride had
[56:40] gone out riding yeah and the cankerworm
[56:43] caterpillar palmor and Locust had eaten
[56:46] up the church it had all died down right
[56:50] amen but God raised up a Luther with
[56:53] justification yeah this is now the
[56:55] forming of the Bride
[56:56] yeah amen he raised up a Wesley with
[56:59] sanctification he raised up the
[57:01] Pentecostals with the restoration of the
[57:02] gifts three stages of the restoration
[57:06] but he wasn't going to leave us there on
[57:07] the bench of the Jordan he was going to
[57:09] take us all the way into the revealed
[57:11] promised word of today by sending
[57:14] Malachi 4:5 and 6 by sending Revelation
[57:17] 10 to bring us all the way into the land
[57:19] of our
[57:20] inheritance amen so the people who are
[57:23] now exposed Amen to the preaching of the
[57:25] Shepherds amen sermons and the angels
[57:28] that bring the revelation of God yeah
[57:31] yeah amen now remember the Angels
[57:33] brought the teaching the Shepherds
[57:35] brought the
[57:36] preaching praise the Lord and they
[57:39] preached for two years messah King is on
[57:43] earth
[57:44] now what have we've been preaching since
[57:46] Revelation sounded amen Revelation 10
[57:48] sounded if since 1963 we've been trying
[57:51] to tell the world Amen that Messiah is
[57:54] come back with a shout

[58:07] people of
[58:09] God we have a sure word of Prophecy yes

[59:44] kind of news gets to the
[59:45] king but here they were asking there's

[1:02:42] things to the world to make you settle
[1:02:44] into a latery and lukewarm spirit amen
[1:02:46] to not get infused with the word to not

[1:02:55] life life to get so clogged down amen
[1:02:57] and bugged down with the cares of this
[1:03:00] life that the Angel's message has no

[1:03:27] into the greatest message that has ever
[1:03:29] struck the face of the Earth no other
[1:03:31] group of people have a message with the
[1:03:34] title deed that Adam lost in the hands
[1:03:37] not even the the apostles at Pentecost
[1:03:40] could say that they had the title deed
[1:03:41] back in their hands because it was not
[1:03:43] released at that time the word the full
[1:03:46] word was released now in the end time
[1:03:48] through Revelation
[1:03:50] 107 amen amen amen praise the Lord am
[1:03:57] amen praise the Lord
[1:04:00] amen amen amen hallu let's get to that
[1:04:04] first quote there in the
[1:04:05] Rapture now watch we don't have time to
[1:04:08] get into all of it there's a quote there
[1:04:11] maybe you'll find it if you can he says
[1:04:14] the word as is in the bride as it is in
[1:04:18] Mary which word was in Mary
[1:04:22] am Jesus
[1:04:24] Christ who put that word in
[1:04:26] Mary the Holy
[1:04:29] Ghost the Holy Ghost created a sperm and
[1:04:33] put it inside the womb of Mary amen
[1:04:37] think of how powerful that
[1:04:39] is think of this holy ghost that you
[1:04:42] have the Holy Ghost itself has creative
[1:04:47] power yes
[1:04:49] sir amen the Holy Ghost living in you as
[1:04:53] creative power am yes how how about we
[1:04:56] unleash him how about we give him full
[1:05:00] access praise the
[1:05:02] Lord
[1:05:05] now just like how the Holy Ghost put the
[1:05:08] seed in Mary to bring forth a son
[1:05:11] physical
[1:05:13] sonen the angel of God which is the Holy
[1:05:15] Ghost has come
[1:05:18] again now that the bride is been
[1:05:21] resurrected the head was
[1:05:24] resurrected now the body has been
[1:05:26] resurrected from
[1:05:27] denominationalism from religions of the
[1:05:29] earth God has resurrected the bride
[1:05:32] remember the message I don't have time
[1:05:33] to get into all what a resurrection that
[1:05:36] was and he says what a resurrection this
[1:05:38] is to be quickened to
[1:05:41] lifeall so he says now Jesus wants
[1:05:45] fruit of for
[1:05:47] himself his wife must bring forth the
[1:05:50] kind of children that he is so Jesus
[1:05:53] doesn't want you to be a beautiful wife
[1:05:57] just dressed in your Royal apparel he
[1:05:59] wants you to get
[1:06:03] pregnant
[1:06:05] hello amen his wife must bring forth the
[1:06:08] kind of children that he is somebody
[1:06:10] tell me what he is starts with w he is
[1:06:13] the word so the kind of children that we
[1:06:16] must produce is word
[1:06:17] children then if it doesn't bring forth
[1:06:20] children bright children wor children
[1:06:23] then it's the denominational child
[1:06:27] praise the Lord amen then her first love
[1:06:30] for the world and denomination she's
[1:06:32] gone back to death and it can't bring
[1:06:34] forth the real genuine born again
[1:06:35] Christian cuz there's nothing there to
[1:06:37] bring it forth so Jesus hasn't come Amen
[1:06:41] to find a Barren wife yes sir very
[1:06:44] clearly in the Rapture messages one of
[1:06:46] the last messages he says Jesus wants
[1:06:48] fruit for himself Jesus wants children
[1:06:51] word children bright children amen
[1:06:54] praise the Lord
[1:06:56] yeah he says in the message now the
[1:06:59] spoken word is the Original Seed that's
[1:07:01] what's the matter today you want some
[1:07:03] kind of phony makeup with screaming
[1:07:06] jumping speaking in tongues something
[1:07:09] instead of waiting for the real word to
[1:07:11] be made manifest through the
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:14] bride them kind that takes the word is
[1:07:18] God's true bride bringing forth
[1:07:22] children amen amen they can't can't die
[1:07:26] a child the bride brings forth on the
[1:07:28] word can't
[1:07:31] die because it's the word yes did you
[1:07:35] get it she can't die that child can't
[1:07:37] die because he's a word child he's a
[1:07:40] seed child he's an eternal child
[1:07:43] hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen
[1:07:47] yeah in the message I'm just trying to
[1:07:49] get all these quotes in amen so we can
[1:07:50] bring it to a close now at the as the
[1:07:53] end as the end time prophecies will rep
[1:07:55] repeat I believe as the first Forerunner
[1:07:58] came from the Wilderness and cried yeah
[1:08:00] now I was trying to show you this before
[1:08:02] that John the Baptist pointed to the
[1:08:05] Head William Brandon points to the body
[1:08:08] he is it now he's saying it here as the
[1:08:10] first for came from the Wilderness and
[1:08:12] cried Behold the Lamb of God the second
[1:08:14] Forerunner will probably do will
[1:08:17] probably do the same by pointing the
[1:08:19] people to a word born bride
[1:08:23] amen so both forerunners are pointing to
[1:08:26] one body yes sir one is pointing to the
[1:08:30] Head the other is pointing to the body
[1:08:33] everybody's understanding that point
[1:08:35] amen amen praise the Lord
[1:08:37] yes so he says the second Forerunner
[1:08:40] will probably do the same by pointing
[1:08:42] the people to a word born bride that's
[1:08:44] why he says they will come in church
[1:08:47] there's been churches churches Brides
[1:08:49] brides churches churches but they must
[1:08:51] come
[1:08:52] one right he says amen uh she be a super
[1:08:55] Church a super what is he doing pointing
[1:08:57] you to a word born
[1:08:59] bride doesn't he keep pointing
[1:09:01] you amen should be a super Church super
[1:09:04] race if she gets to recognize who she is
[1:09:07] what she stands for amen she can do the
[1:09:09] Greater Works Satan will be powerless
[1:09:11] before she'll be an invincible Army what
[1:09:14] is he doing pointing you to a word born
[1:09:16] bride amen amen hallelujah amen telling
[1:09:20] you she's bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:09:22] flesh Spirit of his Spirit she is him
[1:09:26] amen yes that the The Head and the body
[1:09:28] are not two it's
[1:09:30] one amen praise the Lord amen he says
[1:09:34] the bride of Christ will be pointed to
[1:09:36] the sky at the appearing of Jesus
[1:09:39] screaming Behold the Lamb of God will
[1:09:41] come forth from his lips God help us be
[1:09:44] ready for this near
[1:09:46] event hallelujah amen he says but you
[1:09:50] remember when it went down the grain
[1:09:52] began to ripen before that grain can
[1:09:54] ripen everything in the stalk had to be
[1:09:56] dead can't you see where we standing
[1:09:59] life is in the grain again what is it
[1:10:02] just exactly like the same grain that
[1:10:04] went into the ground the same Jesus
[1:10:10] in somebody read it for me the same
[1:10:13] Jesus
[1:10:16] in the same
[1:10:18] Jesus come on now that Jesus had healed
[1:10:22] the
[1:10:22] blind oh that Jesus that caused a man's
[1:10:25] hand that was with it to come forth that
[1:10:28] Jesus that turned water into wine that
[1:10:31] Jesus had raised up
[1:10:39] Lazarus the same Jesus in The Bride form
[1:10:45] amen
[1:10:48] same can you not change it
[1:10:50] brother I didn't have my Pro neutal to
[1:10:53] have that power there
[1:10:55] I like future life it's got amino
