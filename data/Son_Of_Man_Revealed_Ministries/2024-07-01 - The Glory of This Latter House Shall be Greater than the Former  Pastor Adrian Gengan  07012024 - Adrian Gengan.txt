name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen I trust that the new year is amen treating you well amen you know people say uh I want to see what the new year has in store for me no you need to speak what you want amen you don't leave it to chance amen God has put the power of the spoken word in your mouth amen nothing will happen if you the creator doesn't speak amen hallelujah if you know who's living in you then you know what I'm talking about the Creator amen and then I'm very excited to announce amen that our youngest member is in church this morning am is she hiding somewhere Zoe life amen hallelujah I don't know if she'll ever remember this but if she watches let's give her a good hand clap of Praise sister I mean Sister Sarah is back in church as well amen good to see you Sister Sarah TR you covering well amen when I saw you were out and about yesterday I was saying praise the Lord she's coming to church today amen hallelujah amen so we are thankful amen that the Lord was able to be with him amen through the birth of the baby and even now they can enjoy the benefits of that amen hallelujah you know it's God who gives life and we ought to appreciate life amen I know as they get older they frustrate you they work on your nerves amen but it's God's gift to us amen hallelujah you know you got to be good to them because in your older years you don't know what's going to happen to you amen and then the children will take care of you amen and the Bible says that you must honor your mother and father so that your days will be long upon the face of the Earth amen hallelujah so if some of you are living very long we know that you were honoring your mother and father amen praise the Lord so this morning we'll speak on the glory of the L house shall be greater than the former amen the glory of the latter house shall be greater than the former and our scripture reading will be AI 2:9 amen scripture reads the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former sayth the Lord of hosts now this is that sayith the Lord the brightest th seeth the Lord she keep still amen the glory of this L house shall be greater than the former sayi the Lord of hosts and in this place I will give Shalom amen say the Lord of hosts now we know in Shalom he took a right Shine for thy light has come amen so when he is giving Shalom he's giving us a seven seal light which gives us perfect peace amen when all Satan's schemes is uncovered and the Mystery of redemption is fully revealed to us it puts us at peace and it makes us joy joyful because the true meaning of joy is knowing the end result and remaining joyful amen hallelujah so that is a prophecy over us that the glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former amen Joel 2: 24:25 amen hallelujah I Pray by the time we read the scripture you're going to get into the spirit of this word amen hallelujah Joel 2: 24 says and the floor shall be full of wheat amen this is not talking about the temple that he's building the glory of the from the latter house this is you now your floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine Revelation amen and oil Holy Ghost there shall be an overflow yes and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmerworm my great Army which I sent amongst you so whatever happened through seven Church ages God is restoring the church to its former glory but not only to its former glory he says this house shall be greater amen amen amen amen you may be seated the Lord at blessings to the reading of his word amen so we know that the first house was Solomon's Temple just to bring in context you can put up that first verse we read again if you're looking for what what is the former house how am I going to be greater the former house was Solomon's Temple where the presence of the Lord came down amen now every time the glory of the Lord comes down he comes down when there's a sacrifice on the altar amen the presence of the Lord comes down to consume the sacrifice so what is the second temple now we know the Lord does not dwell in temples made with hands so the second temp Temple that the Lord is building we find here in 1 Corinthians 6:9 he says knowing not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen which is in you amen amen how if you got the Holy Ghost In You amen I don't want the Holy Ghost outside of me amen I I don't want the Holy Ghost on my flesh that's why you find people jumping and shouting amen but no life amen hallelujah I don't want the Holy Ghost only on my spirit amen but I want the Holy Ghost in my soul am amen that's the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and that is the true meaning of that quote if you can receive the word for your day and your age yes sir that's a sign you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the only way you can receive the word for your day is to receive it in your soul amen amen hallelujah because in the soul resides Faith or doubt amen and to doubt the message of the hour is not to receive the holy ghost in your soul but to receive the message of the hour is to receive the holy ghost in your soul give God praise amen that you have the Holy Ghost in your soul that's the difference between us and denominations some have it in the flesh some have it in the spirit amen some have it in the outer Court some have it in the inner court but we have taken it into the holiest of holiest amen amen amen second Corinthians 6:16 says what agreement at the temple of God with Idols now we just said that we are the temple of God so why are the idols set up in the temple of God Amen we have suckig as Idols amen we have musicians as Idols we have all kinds of things and people set set up as Idols in the temple of God he's saying what agreement at the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God and God had said I will dwell in them and walk in them amen amen amen if you're looking for God outside of you you are going to miss it God is walking in the midst of you and I will be their God and they shall be my people amen now you know that when somebody builds a house they's planning amen so we're talking about the glory of the latter of this latter house shall be greater than the former house yes so when somebody's building a house there's planning there's imagination there's creativity they have a vision of what they want you to look like then they employ a plan draw or an architect amen and they design what they have in their mind they put it down as a drawing then once that plan is passed they get the builders to go to work that's what the five4 ministry is doing building according to the blueprint that God had in the back part of his mind hallelujah amen God is using the fful Ministry to build his church to equip his church to empower the church amen hallelujah amen now the Lord says that we now we just said that we are the temple of God so if God designed us God had a thought of us God had an imagination of us amen then the Lord says we are fearfully and wonderfully made people may look down on you people may say all manner of things of you but you need declare the scripture don't believe a man's word you say I am fearfully and wonderfully made they say you're good for nothing say amen I am fearfully and wonderfully made amen amen the Lord says that he knows the plans that he has for you amen not to arm you but to give you a hope and a future so God has designed the plan so that we would reach glorification and nothing or no one can change the plan yes amen amen the same way in this life now you can choose the type of life you want on this Earth God has put the Power of Choice within you you're a free moral agent amen you can choose your career you can choose your partner you want to marry in this life it is all your choice yeah how many if you know the prophet of God teaches that you can choose to become whatever you want your current state that you are in now the financial State your marital State any state that you are in physically is because of the choices you made yes right amen nobody forced you even if if it was arranged marriage you had to agree to it right amen nobody put a gun to your head you could have said no so the prophet tells us you can't say no amen but in all your choices my encour enement to you is put God first amen you young people will will start to make many choices in life but put God first amen doesn't the scripture teach us seeking first the kingdom of God Amen you see if you go seeking material things according to the will of your own flesh maybe you'll achieve something but it may not be what God wanted for you maybe you'll achieve buying a three-bedroom house but maybe in God's economy he had a six-bedroom house for you but you went and pursued your own plan and now you got a three-bedroom house but in God's mind six-bedroom house amen hallelujah amen maybe you went and pursued your own way and you married Jezebel but in God's mind he had you married to Esther now you got to live with Jezebel all the days of your life why it's the choices you make amen so my encouragement to the young people run as far away as possible from Jezebel amen or that other woman who likes to stroke your hair what's her name Delilah she likes to stroke your hair and cut your locks off cut your power you know you know you must see them around the girl they're like a puppy powerless weak yes love okay love you can't go to church today okay love what did the prophet says petty coat government they're wearing their wife's pett coats what did you get for Christmas my wife bought me a new penic coat hey amen but God established it according to his word and we've got to come the biblical way yes amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord so whatever we choose to do in life put God first whatever you imagine to do in this life have the faith to Believe in Your Vision you know some of us wrote Visions down it didn't come to pass and now we are in impatience we are thinking that God is not working according to his plan you know God wrote A Vision down he gave his vision to Isaiah the prophet and he said a virgin shall conceive 800 years passed before that Vision came to pass he didn't write the name Mary there but God had already designed the woman that would make that Vision come to pass he says write the vision though it car wait for it for it must come to pass amen praise the Lord so the tearing the waiting does not mean it is not meant for you amen it does not mean that amen it's not meant for you but God will bring it to pass in the right time and the right season am you know there are five months Amen in the right time in the right season according to his will and his purpose for your life so don't grow weary in the waiting amen hallelujah don't stagger at the promise of God amen amen hallelujah in due time God will fulfill it the question question is can you remain patient in the midst of trial in the midst of waiting can you remain patient can you grow stronger in faith and can you remain joyful in the midst of trial giving praise to God amen amen in the midst of your physical sickness can you hold to the promise of the word and thank God for your healing even though you feel sick as a dog amen amen yes Lord that's the faith of Abraham yes amen maybe you can't walk but you say praise God I'm Healed maybe you can't see but you say praise God I'm healed amen maybe you SE no change in the physical symptoms but you declare by the stripes of Jesus I am healed amen praise the Lord hallelujah maybe you're unemployed now this is a hard thing for people to do to come out from the Physical Realm into the spiritual realm in the midst of your unemployment can you thank God for his provision can you thank God and say I thank you Lord that you are my God and you are my provider you are Jehovah Gyra and you remain faithful and I thank you for my job even though I physically do not have a job but I thank you for my job amen amen yes thank you Lord maybe you're just somebody that's not amen not not anything in your company now but you're trusting the Lord for promotion can you thank the Lord and already see yourself in the position you desire and thank the Lord that you are already managing it thank the Lord that you're already directing it thank the Lord that you're already opening a new business somebody receive this word in the name of Jesus Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord but it all starts with what you desire yes it all starts can you remain faithful amen amen if you say to this mountain amen hallelujah amen hallelujah don't remain stuck in your situation have some imagination have a vision have a goal in life have a purpose in life amen hallelujah you know God's not taking us from a natural body to a worse body God is taking us from one glory to the next Glory then there should be progress in the people of God am amen yes amen yes Lord amen didn't uh amen the Apostle say there beloved I wish that you prosper that you be in health and prosper he's talking about physical things even as your soul prospers spiritually I want you to prosper in the Natural Things So beloved I wish above all things that you being Health Amen in 2024 and that you prosper in all things Lord thank you Lord thank you Father amen praise the Lord amen thank God for his provision amen hallelujah when you have a problem with your children amen do you only speak the negative and say my child is like this my child is disobedient you are speaking what you are wanting amen what you are seeing you're not speaking Through The Eyes of Faith to say I thank you Lord that you've given me these children and Lord they are saved they are Sanctified they are serving you I desire the salvation of my two children in the name of Jesus Christ I receive it amen amen you got tell everyone they amen you got tell everybody that they are giving you problems and you confess the negative amen hallelujah but can you remain joyful and thank God for giving you Godly children you see that's the challenge that's the faith of Abraham to speak the things that you want not what you see not what you're going through amen hallelujah even in the midst of marital crisis can you thank the Lord that you have a marriage according to Ephesians chapter 5 amen can you thank the Lord that your husband is coming in alignment with the word of God can you thank the Lord that your wife is coming in alignment with the word of God Amen Hallelujah let me check when I was seeking the face of the Lord the Lord told me amen there's a spirit of stress come upon the people there's a spirit of anxiety come upon the people amen because we live in a stressed out age we live in a world full of anxiety amen and these things lead to diseases these things lead Amen to sicknesses and illnesses and ulcers and eye blood pressure and sugar diabetes amen all because of worry all because of stress but we come and that is a spirit yes but we are here to expose that spirit this morning amen we are here to expose the strong man in a house yes amen the spirit of depression come upon people they can't be joyful amen because they are so caught up in the problem of their mind yes and that becomes your oppression am and you want to serve the Lord but you are oppressed you come into the house of the Lord but you can't break free yeah because of Oppression because of demonic influence over your life amen but when you come into His presence there is fullness of joy and he whom the son of man is set free is's free indeed amen let me tell you the first step to your breakthrough start to praise the

mighty rushing wind coming amen amen yes Lord amen here what the prophet says we read this quote but I just want to continue reading it it says Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts now I want to declare to you that the book book of Acts was the glory of the former Church come on now they didn't have all the opening of the word they went out with one part of the word amen but at the end time amen hallelujah at the seven Church age the glory of the latter house people will be greater than the former house amen you say Greater Works than these shall you do than that's written in the book of Acts I declare to you the word of the Lord Greater Works and these shall you do yes amen oh thank you Lord God has not revealed all Seven Seals to us the mystery that was in the back part of his mind to reveal your true identity for you to be a weak defeated Church you're a glorious church amen wonderful thank you Father amen hallelujah in fact the prophet says you're a super Church Hallelujah yes the glory of the latter church is a super Church a super race hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord the prophet tells us about there's only a selected group of people that will not see death yes Enoch was one of them amen praise the Lord Elijah was another one amen praise the Lord the Old Testament saints that AR Rose was another one Jesus Christ amen Rose we know he was the corner the the Keystone of the Bible amen and then we come in this age the ones that will not see death a special class of people amen give God praise if you identif by yourself to death you shall have a body [Music] change it might sound ridiculous to us Amen to some of us amen but you shall not see death that's right amen your body shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eyej amen and then we know that Moses and Elijah yes sir amen hallelujah the prophesied wants to come yeah it tells us about the Book of Revelation how it exposes the Antichrist spirit that would come into the church defile it it this is now through the six Church ages making it lukewarm formal powerless you see how the glory left the church why Antichrist Spirit came in yeah you reading that quote there praise the Lord Brother Joshua so caught up in the service amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church amen and defile it making it lukewarm formal powerless he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for she can do the Greater Works amen she will be an invincible Army amenah amen if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her yesen amen you see God has an expectation I'm reading to you God's Vision about you yes God has an expectation for you yes am now as long as you remain in the flesh you are not going to come up to this right amen but I declare this is the Year of Jubilee amen amen this is the Year of Jubilee when the lame shall walk and the blind shall see amen the Lord shall set the captives free how through You by and through the members of the body of Christ he will finish the work he couldn't finish it all through that first to the Virgin Mary the prophet says but he says by and through the members of the body of Christ he will fulfill all that he prophesied to be done through that virgin bride Oh Glory Glory Glory glory amen thank you the only Glory that will reveal itself in this hour is through you and me I want there to sink in yes if God's to manifest himself on the earth in this time it's going to be through the body of Jesus Christ through the entire message people amen I tell you we are getting a revelation of it we are doing the Greater Works Satan is powerless before us how based on our Revelation you say Revelation yes that's why Jesus says the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against Revelation all hell is against this end time Revelation That's Why They Crucified that's why they mock it amen that's why they're trying Amen to amen speak against the cloud amen that's why they trying to speak against the prophet of the age and call him a liar Satan knows if he can amen put some negativity and doubt about the prophet amen people will start to leave the message but I tell you what he is doing amen he's helping God God fulfill his plan because Jesus said at that last time you let it grow till it's our time so Satan has just put into play and to progress and now God is gathering the tears that's why you see them leaving by The Hundreds the tears were grown with the wheat yes but people are leaving the message because their tears being bound for the fire yes amen and they cannot shame the glory of this L house amen they will make Believers in the church but God cannot have make believers who true genuine Believers so God has taken them away so that you can shine in your hidden Beauty amen amen amen hallelujah now listen to this Romans 3:22 what it says he's talking about righteousness yeah how righteousness couldn't come from the law and he says righteousness comes from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe so if you ever feeling unrighteous stop relying on your own righteousness if you're feeling unrighteous you're relying on your own righteousness the Bible says our righteousness is as filthy rags amen there's nothing you can do in this life to present yourself righteous before God the only way you present yourself righteous is to come in Christ amen yes amen through faith now you believe in Jesus Christ there is no distinction now watch what he says all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God what is his glory we have fallen from the glory of God here the prophet says you came like Adam like me you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted in order to stamp Temptation you had to bypass the theophany because of what Adam did Adam chose to follow the voice of his wife rather than follow the voice of God yes you see Brothers why it's so important Adam chose his wife the voice of his wife over the voice of God amen amen you had to bypass your theophany you had to come down here in the flesh to be tempted by sin he says but look when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin but he says when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have one waiting that's where we go that is the word amen praise the Lord how many if you have got one waiting how many if you have heard from your theop amen the prophet says we are bumping into into a theophany what is that meaning the blending in of Two Worlds the blending in of Dimensions amen every time you're getting Revelation about yourself that's you connecting with your theopen body amen you get a shock and you remember amen glimpses you're connecting with your theophany one day the two Dimensions will merge together yes that six Dimension has got to come onto the Earth amen your your theopen your body must come come to pick up your flesh body now what is the glory of God we're talking about the glory of God we said we shame his glory this year amen amen hallelujah the glory of God if you follow instruction if you follow what the spirit is saying you shall see the glory of God Amen yeah what I'm telling you you shall share in his glory you shall share in his glory amen if you follow the instruction yes amen he's taking us from one glory to another Glory 2023 opened up the supernatural the prophet in the seventh seal says when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ am amen come on now amen I don't know if you can say you saw the supernatural in 2023 amen so if the mind of Christ has come in type that up brother Josh Supernatural comes in mind of Christ did you get it amen he says when the supernatural comes in you'll find that in the seventh seal he says that's the mind of Christ why am I telling you that if we have seen the Supernatural come into the church I'm not talking about this local church only we've seen it sweep globally amen yes amen the Supernatural coming to the church he says that's the mind of Christ did we get it yeah there's it here in the seven seal may I just pass this to you it sounds like a bon is passing when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of [Music] Christ now what's the other quote you all know it the bride had has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word so I'm telling you if the mind of Christ has come in then we know what he wants done with the word amen so listen to me when I'm telling you that he's taking us into his glory realm he's taking us into his glory anointing H some of you don't believe me the same one who told you last year that this will be the most Supernatural for the CH year for the church he's telling you this will be the most glorious year for the church if you can follow the instruction amen amen thank you Lord you see people they they know where I'm heading with this because if I tell you you're going to see the glory of God you're going to have to surrender you're going to have to die to yourself Lord because the glory of God won't come into a filthy Temple an ungodly Temple the glory of God will come when the temple is clean amen you remember what Psalm 24 is who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord who shall come into the glory realm he that has Clean Hands and a pure heart that's Psalms 24 why does it follow Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd yes why does Psalm 24 take us into the glory realm who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord amen amen yes Lord amen so the glory of God is the visible manifestation of his attributes and his character his glory is revealed in creation doesn't the bible say that the Sun the moon the stars the oceans the fish the sea animal life plant life all display the glory of God Amen it's only man has fallen in sin yes they don't display the glory of God but they are born again Sons and Daughters of God coming into manifestation who are now displaying the glory of God Amen you see we read this last week that the glory of God is Mark [Music] 16 amen so how do you manifest the glory of God when you pray for the sick and they are healed yes when you pray for the ones that are bound and they are delivered you are manifesting the glory of God than you Lord amen amen amen hallelujah I don't want to go too much into it because sometimes it might sound like algebra to you but I hope you get what I'm saying yes the prophet says Mark 16 is the true church amen yes amen nothing can hide from the glory of God yes in fact doesn't the Bible say in Psalm 19 that the heavens declare the glory of God you want to see the glory of God put your Netflix off put your YouTube off put your games off and if you've never seen the glory of God go outside look at creation hallelujah what does it say psalm 19 the heavens declare the glory of God don't we sing all Heavens declare the glory of the RIS Lord what does it say the heavens declare the glory of God the firmament that's the heavens shows his handywork they see they are speaking day and to day they atate speech oh yes amen when the sun shines it's speaking that there's a Risen Sun amen when the moon comes out in its Glory it's telling you that in the absence of the sun there's a light on the earth amen the stars are shining brightly they are speaking it's saying day unto day they atth speech night unto night showeth knowledge amen there is no speech no language where their voice is not heard so no matter what language you speak you can hear the glory of God through creation just that people are so blinded didn't God try and I mean didn't the prophet show that man with the apple on that pole and he took the apple tree and he showed our life goes down to the root he showed the glory of God in in nature didn't that man that Wicked Man with that bleaching sound of that phone when he made that sound and the deer came out to look for its baby didn't he see the glory of God in creation didn't he break down and give his heart to the Lord Jesus Christ there the glory of the Lord is all around but people refuse to see it they follow the vain imaginations amen hallelujah now remember what we just read there now that all have fallen from the glory of God Romans 3:22 we were reading there right all have sinned and fallen short of the glory what is the key word fall they have fallen short but because of what Jesus Christ has done we don't have to fall short anymore amen come on now amen I'm not falling short anymore yes Lorden hey you got a scripture yes let's read Jude 1:24 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling amen there is one that's keeping me from falling amen you know what that means he's my support structure amen amen hallelujah what's keeping this thing from falling the support structure meaning if that was not there I would fall but Christ is my show foundation on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is think King sand unto him that is able to keep me from falling yes you say that there are things in life to make me fall to make me stumble yes there may be situation that may cause me to stumble but he is keeping me from falling amen what are you talking about lust is coming after you to make you fall but he is keeping you from falling A Hallelujah woman is coming after you to make you fall but he he is keeping you from falling amen yes Lord thank you Lord amen money is coming after you to make you fall but he is keeping you from falling popularity and fame is coming to make you fall but he is keeping you from falling oh I wish you could rejoice in the room yes Lord amen thank you Lord thank you Lord he is keeping you from falling and to present you faultless nobody's perfect because because you're living in the flesh you say that all the time we can't live in our Perfection none of us will be perfect on the Earth but that's outside of Christ that's outside of Christ talk if you ever talk that way that's outside of Christ talk if you are in Christ you are sinless spotless perfect thank you Lord amen spotless the Bible says without wrinkle thank you Father don't ever use language outside of Christian kingdom talk yes amen that's car talk yes I'm perfected in Christ amen the reason you talk like that is because you out of Christ oh thank you but I am sinless thank you I am perfect brother how you my righteousness is in Christ my perfection is in Christ my glory is in Christ amen amen amen you see how we can live in the glory it's in Christ amen there's no condemnation to those that are in Christ amen amen don't let Satan whisper to you you see what you're doing you see what you're doing as long as in your life you're going to have that sticky nature don't focus on the sticky nature focus on the Christ that's within you am thank you Lord uh BR I want to go denomination they say I'm as come as you are they don't ask me to be like [Music] you hey they stop singing the song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus or Liars they don't like that song anymore they want to be like some big name amen they all want to take on the spirit of their Pastor they all want to be wealthy they all want to be prosperous amen but yeah we want the Life of Christ amen amen hallelujah now you say can I really shame the glory of god let's see what Jesus prayed for us amen you know Jesus prayed yes let's see what our lord Jesus our husband prayed for Eve he says neither so he was praying for the 12 disciples you can read that but I want to pick it up from verse 20 he's saying neither do I pray for these disciples alone but for them also which are Shall Believe on me through their word yes can you identify with that Jesus is's praying for you yes that they may all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me amen so you see how you become part of the godhead oh come on now yes amen why you think there was a mystery that Revelation 10:7 had to reveal you think it was partial mystery what is Jesus saying here he's
