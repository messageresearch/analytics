power and authority Lord father pray Lord you know edify us and encourage us this morning we ask it in the Blessed name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with much Thanksgiving amen man blessed be the name of the Lord amen I get you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the one who was that is to come amen hallelujah amen I trust that everyone is well even as we draw one day closer to the coming of the Lord when we shall be changed from these vital creatures that we are into a glorified being that we are amen right now represented in the sixth Dimension is theophany bodies that are waiting for your release amen and I tell you the Bible says that all creation is groaning and they are a part of creation amen for 6 000 years man has gone into this dimension longing to come back to the earth into the ought to be conditioned and here we are the Bible says that all creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons and the daughters of God and we are living at the brink of that hour amen hallelujah so we greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Amen I trust that you are well amen hallelujah let's turn to the Bible Esther chapter 2 verse 16. who speak this morning amen the Fallen rise of a queen amen we're just taking nuggets you know this week after week we're just taking nuggets out of Esther amen Esther 2 verse 16 so Esther was taken unto King asaurus into his house in the tenth month which is the month of in the seventh year of his Reign so there's 10 7 amen under the message of 10 7 we go into the Kings Royal House in verse 17 and the King loved Esther above all women above all churches now and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the other virgins more than the other five who didn't have oil so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made a Queen instead of vasty [Music] right what happens after we become Queen don't we go to a married supper then see Verse 18 then the king made a great feast so that's likened unto the married supper and to all his princes and his servants even Esther's feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king amen so right there we notice one thing one Queen had fallen fasting and yet another king is risen Our Queen is risen Esther let's turn to Revelation 5 and 5 this is just to tie in how it's possible that we can rise up after a fall we find ourselves in a human condition subject to the five senses and it's really the five senses that are warring against the spirit man so then the prophet says we're backslide daily amen but here's a way that we can rise every day because of what happened here so there's a cry going out I'm not going to read it from all I'm just going from verse 5. who's worthy to take the book of redemption there was nobody found worthy they searched Heaven they searched fear they even searched beneath the Earth meaning they searched the realm of the Dead to see if there was a man who had gone by was worthy so they looked at Adam Abraham Isaac Jacob and all of these Great Men of God and no one was found worthy so yeah we'll pick it up in verse 5 when one of the Islanders said unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book notice it's in a past tense not is going to prevail but had prevailed Amen to open the book amen amen to open the book means to lose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four peace and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb yes as it had been slain having seven arms and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them ups and golden Wilds full of odors which are the praise of the Saints and they sang a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the Seal's day off for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people Nations and he had made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign in heaven we shall reign on the earth man's rightful position so because of that he puts us back into our rightful position because of the scene amen you may be seated the Lord and blessings to the reading of his word amen Hallelujah amen we look around the world today and we see that Society if we're going to say is collapsing but we can also say as totally collapsed if we look at the moral situation the economic situation the social situation the political situation they are on a downward spiral until they are going to end up in the bottomless pit in the Lake of Fire we notice the one that is responsible for putting them in this condition is Satan yeah when Satan was in heaven he tried to destabilize the kingdom of heaven and now that he was on the Earth we're talking about Genesis now he was trying to destabilize the Earth his attempts to destabilize in heaven got squashed amen and he got kicked out of heaven amen now that he's on the earth he's no longer the Royal Sheriff that surrounds the throne he's not the most beautiful angel but he is cast down to the Earth and is a spirit that can influence bodies and he found a serpent then he began to possess and he began to speak through the serpent amen and through the serpent he was trying to destabilize the Earth in heaven amen we said his plan was met with Fierce resistance and he could not Prevail over Michael and his angels now when it comes down to the Earth he does not have the kind of power and authority like man has because man was pleased ruler over the Earth man was God of the Earth God had made man ruler over the earth and the prophet will say this you'll find this in fundamental foundations of our faith I think it's sin maybe paragraph eight you'll begin to pick this up in fundamental foundations for Faith amen I didn't get my stick back so I would have given you the notes but it's fine just find it in fundamental foundations of Faith amen the prophet would say like this that he made Man Superior to anything on Earth he gave him the jurisdiction of everything on Earth to control everything men could control animal life he controlled the bird life the fish of the sea he controlled botany life he could speak to Wildlife and it would obey him he could speak to the waters amen yes yes Adam could speak to the wind and it could stop Adam could speak and say peace be still and the winds and the waves would have been here amen I want you to know that this is how man is supposed to be yes you and I are supposed to be in this position there's nobody else on the face of the Earth that'll be able to tell you where man fell from not even the denominations no the kind of authority that Adam had it's only the prophet that is unveiling that Adam Had Creative power and could speak these things into existence outside of the message nobody knows that children are supposed to come by the spoken word Hallelujah you're not going to learn in school you are only going to learn about a five cents man amen a flesh-body man the anatomy of a man the biology of a man that can dissect the man but you will never hear that man as his spirit amen amen they're gonna tell us that man has his soul but in the kingdom of God he tells us that we are a spirit being that was put into a body of Flesh and we possess a soul amen and the Soul like the prophet says is the nature of the spirit I ask you to examine the nature of your soul this morning because in the soul can either be Faith or doubt what is the nature and the condition of your soul is it full of Faith this morning or is it full of doubt and reasoning because that's what happened to cause the queen of Eden to fall he was a woman of faith she was living in a faith civilization she was watching Adam operating his gifting and his anointing yeah amen so we know that Adam and Eve never had to be sick they never had worries they never had gray hair they never had heartache never had fear never had to worry about death amen and the prophet would say every evening they would just climb into the arms of the father just like a child everything was his and whatever he asked for he got it everything obeyed him because he was a child of God and the prophet says the child is heir of all things now in paragraph verse paragraph nine you'll pick this up in the same message fundamental foundations for Faith he says man was a secondary God on Earth he was given power to control all things all elements of the Earth that was Adam Adam was given these great powers did we have another Adam in our day who could speak to the fish of the sea I give you back your life he could speak to the Flying piece and say do not harm me amen could he speak to the peace in the field yes the Raging Bull Adam reproduce again on the earth because of redemption's claims amen if the prophet was not taken of the Earth this man was like Enoch you don't believe me could read the time he was walking through that storm yes amen you remember the time he thought and he spoke to the storm and he cleared and then as it cleared he said he walked a little way and he went into Virgin Territory of wood Timber and he says in the next he was thinking about his wife Mira that he had married on October maybe 24th I think it was amen and he said he went there every year and he would just as a commemoration he would think about his wife and he said as he began to sit there he looked before he says tears was running down his eyes he was thinking about all of these things and he was looking at the steers falling on his gray whiskers and then in a moment in the twinkling of an eye he says he looked in front of him and he saw his young body this young man yes what caused him to change dimensions what caused him to change the atoms of his body if not an Enoch walk and he said appearing in front of him was who now you go and fathom that out shall we leave shall we change dimensions there is a realm that we can tap into and that's be where we are heading to right now amen but we've got to create that Faith civilization again yes amen amen he told us how to live in a world of perfect Faith which only us and God Alone he gave us the key ingredients too getting perfect Faith now we need to use it right in order to achieve this in the second coming of Christ okay sorry we got verse 9 there let's just stay there let's see where he failed right so he was a second regard on Earth he was given power to control all things all elements of fear that was Adam Adam was given these great powers then Adam then the power that he was given to reproduce himself is where he fell what is that the power to reproduce himself is where he fell now how did he fall he was not supposed to come via natural child bearing why sowing the seed into Eve he was supposed to buy the spoken word speak you know this book that we read about in Revelation 5 where the names were in he's supposed to speak every name in that book amen amen amen now what Adam failed to do Jesus Christ the last Adam the Redeemer is successfully reproducing his life amen why the spoken word because the spoken word is the original scene amen now the prophet would go on the same we read the sport last week in the second coming of Christ the church is married to Christ we are the wife of Christ bringing four children so what he failed to do we are doing bringing forth his very own life we are becoming Sons and Daughters of God until we reach full adoption amen we shall receive full adoption when we receive our body change we shall be in our ought to be conditioned in that body in a glorified body in the message the Rapture paragraph 99 he says Jesus wants fruit for himself his wife must bring forth the kind of children that he is now what kind of person is Jesus Jesus is God Jesus is the King of Kings and the Lord of lords amen Jesus he's holy Jesus is righteous Jesus is perfect amen and that's the kind of children that's the kind of life that we must bring forth perfection amen hallelujah in the message fundamental foundations of Faith again paragraph 26 he says God is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit now if he's depending on you let's open up our channels and let the Holy Spirit come in and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts amen he says revivals come okay have we got have we got back to the fundamental foundations of faith I want to get to this Fortune important so Fallen man lost certain things lost certain privileges he says now that is the beginning of man that's what God give him power over everything on Earth you may pick it up maybe from paragraph 11 if you can just check them he says that is the beginning of man that's what God gave him power over everything on Earth Earth fall but we're always telling you that Adam lost three things he lost power over the Earth he lost fellowship with God and he lost eternal life you'll pick this up in this culture he says through the fall he lost that power then it becomes unconscious of the fact that's what I try to tell you that normal man does not know that man supposed to possess the power and the authority he says it becomes unconscious of the fact so he lost fellowship with God now watch he says so through the fall he lost that power then it becomes unconscious to the fact and he says after losing his relationship and friendship fellowship with the father he lost that so he loses fellowship with God right and he says all of these great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now when man finally lost this what he lost in the fall Christ come as a redeemer did he ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he has eternal life now he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to Eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall so it Adam lost power over the Earth eternal life and fellowship of God when Jesus Christ he's taken the book in Revelation 5 and he's coming down with that same book in Revelation 10. then man must be restored back to fellowship with God men must be restored the power over the Earth and man must be restored back to eternal life yeah paragraph 11. see what he says the condition of a man who has his Avenues clogged up he says the thing of it is since he has restored man back to this place man lost his conscience of what the father put him on Earth to do in other words all of the plumbing as it was in our brain and the outlets the faith has been clogged up with business affair with home life domestic things now you're the spiritual being with such power and authority that we are trying to describe to you this morning but watch what's coming to Cloud the channels of this faith business affairs home life domestic things it's become so clogged up with that till God can't operate through those channels that he made for man now who is behind this the one that had come to destabilize the Earth the man wants to strip us of our ought to be conditioned amen but I want you to know no matter how sinful man is no matter what state man finds himself in if he's a son and daughter of a God Amen even in his Fallen condition he is still a son of God amen amen and at a certain time and season God is going to blast through every one of those club channels amen so that the Holy Ghost can flow freely through him and he comes back to his right senses amen why because the price had been paid for his full Redemption God's not going to pay the price for our full Redemption and then leave us in a fallen condition he's going to come to empower us thank you amen hallelujah paragraph 12 I'm going to paraphrase some of this so God designed every the body of our bodies right he designed every organ he designed every part of the human body to function perfectly in order for men to live in order for you to live your heart has got to function properly your lung your liver your kidney if one of these things stop functioning you have a struggle to live yes and he goes on to eventually say this if God so designed the body of a man how much more has he designed and sit in order the body of Christ the church that if one of these organs or members of the body do not function properly the whole body suffers so how did he design the spiritual body he said he designed us to come together in Heavenly places in Christ and have these Supernatural walkings of God through gifts of the Spirit such as prophecy wisdom knowledge gift of healing and all these other different gifts is Outlets that God lets out his power and let out his Revelation to his people how is God going to work if you're following the prophet he's walking through the body to bring Revelation to the people and he says and not as an individual amen amen we do not do it as an individual he says but we as a unit we all together one great body of believers now if Satan by what he tried to do to destabilize the health he's so doubt and reasoning into Eve right if Satan could achieve so much without any reasoning with the law of sin and death that through Satan's command he can send forth cancer into a body and the prophet says man recognizes it and receives it follow what he's saying he says Satan sins artists we recognize it and we receive it a paragraph 13 now I think we are he says if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man how much more God to make his power with his power make his laws work in man amen yes how much more God to his children make his laws be recognized amongst his people of Divine Healing revelation power gifts manifestation of the spirits amen amen the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of Liberty of Christ has come to set us free from those things amen so we are nearing this time now where we are going to recognize these things he says there's been vain philosophies so for teachings to take the human mind and make it rebel against from the word of God now what are we talking about faith coming back to the church that's how this queen is going to rise up by faith and he says faith doesn't come by fasting Faith doesn't come back pain Faith doesn't come by reading a book all of that's good fasting praying reading a book but faith comes by settle something that's in the human heart what is that the word of God because Faith come about the hearing of the word [Music] paragraph 14 he says if we could throw ourselves completely to God and His will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ be in US them same operations of the spirit would work through us just as the Natural Things does just the same [Music] but how hard it is for the man to submit the flesh man he says we were created for purpose to control to rule and to praise God and live for God [Music] everything that is that God spoke in his word if received in the right Channel will meet you realize that word for whatever the promise behind it is God will do it he's obligated to do it amen he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you can have what you asked for right whatever you ask in my name that will I do he says paragraph 16 amen do you realize that if we go before God in Jesus name it's just the same as Jesus himself praying it isn't me praying anymore okay if I come in his name and he recognizes his name Jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that I do and then I go to the father in Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his Spirit praying through me and then I've got to receive what I asked for because he said and it's God's Own word amen amen so we look at Eve and we see that the fall took us away from perfect faith but Redemption brought us back to it now Faith is an unseen Force known only to the believer I don't know if you can say Amen I don't know if you told the doctors something by faith the doctor told you had this and you told them no I do not have that he is operating by his five senses and he's telling you by all that I studied and all the medical experience we've had over the last 6 000 years we have come to the conclusion of the matter that you will die because of this illness and you tell them through six thousand years my Heritage and my forefathers have passed down Faith to my civilization and through all my experiences I am telling you I shall not die but I shall live Amen to see the glory of God Amen and you can't understand what you are talking about you're telling doctor I do not believe your report amen and he asked you whose report will you believe and you shall tell him we shall believe the report of the Lord because his report says I am free his report is I am healed his report says victory amen we believe the report of the king that by his stripes we are healed amen amen so faith is the Unseen Force and Satan walking in the serpent in the Garden of Eden he can't see it but he can feel the sweet atmosphere and he said you know what something's got to be done to change the atmosphere in this place because he cannot live in an atmosphere of faith Satan is paralyzed in an atmosphere of faith and I want to believe that that this place this morning and atmosphere of Faith where Satan is paralyzed and all sickness and demons were free yes Lord amen amen I want you to know that right now there's an unseen Force going through this building it's operating it's at six cents but right now there's also other things flowing through this room other channels flowing through this room I'm gonna describe it for you now we live in a modern age of Technology where I'm going to bring it up to date the prophet will talk about telegrams I'm going to talk about maybe a WhatsApp or your phone that you can send a picture or a text or a video instantly even to the father most part of the Earth now I want to let the younger people know that this was not always possible if you wanted to contact somebody in another country a few years ago you had to write them a letter right this is history lesson for you guys now you have to write them a letter you have to go to the Post Office and buy a stamp you have to put that stamp on that letter and you had to post it off it used to get shipped or if you wanted to send it via airmail you could send it and it could take them maybe a couple of weeks or a month then they must read your letter and they didn't Blue Tick you all right right they add the courtesy they would respond now they must write back to you they must go back to the post office they must put that stamp on that and post it back come on another ship back to you so if you had a few questions you better ask in one letter otherwise it's going to be a back and forth but I'm showing you how science has evolved [Music] so rapidly over this last few years you know young people not even the young people most of you sitting here you didn't have cell phones 20 years ago maybe 25 years ago 30 years ago you didn't have this device in your pocket how are these signals being sent how is that picture if I send it right now you can receive it instantly it's called ether waves can you see it but yet you see that beautiful picture you see that video in full color how did it travel from here to there how is that text being transmitted to that screen if we were connected via Bluetooth Bluetooth would be an unseen Force but you'll be project projecting that image I'm trying to make it so that you understand how faith is a sense that's not seen but yet can be so tangible can be experienced amen amen amen so it moves through into waves yet no man can see that picture moving that video moving but you know this Machinery that can see it because if you commit a crime they can take your cell phone and they can see where that thing originated from the document the video and all the channels it went through right why the prophet says because it's too fast for the human eye but there's a force and he says he says there's still a force even though it's unseen to the human eye right and the continent is delivered to your phone like I try to explain now in paragraph 19 let's go there he says if the natural laws of God which is electricity and these things are honest and controlled in the correct way to do these things how much more the power of God and the Holy Ghost can do once passing through the human heart by faith how long did man take to get to the stage because of research and church and study but faith is as old as time yet man does not want to go to the tried and tested thing that God had given him to empower him now Adam I want three people to read for me today I just want to compare something right we're going to compare the serpent we're going to convey God and we're going to compare Eve all right who wants to play the serpent in this drama nobody amen I want somebody to read Genesis 3 1. right the rameshuri Genesis 3 1. for the Joshua you can read you can play God Genesis 2 16. okay yeah let's ask Mr Sarah to play the eve Genesis 3 verse 2. we're just going to compare some scriptures to see how Satan had sowed his fertility right now yeah that Faith civilization the atmosphere is charged with faith in that Garden right Eve says this thing is bothering me and Adam speaks that mountain out of existence Eve says the sun is too hot here and Adam speaks and he can make a tree grow over ahead and give a shame it's a faith civilization but one day he comes home and he finds this queen he's looking for his Queen Adam looking for his Queen and he finds that in a fallen condition the serpent had deceived like we said on Wednesday because remember the beast at the end will deceive the whole Earth except those names that are written right so here there's the population of two in the Garden of Eden and it deceives 50 of the population he deceives Eve and Eve says that the serpent beguiled me the word beguiled means to be Charmed to be enchanted in a deceptive way he knew how to charm he knew how to Deceiver so the way he presented the word to her caused it to reason let's read brother Ramesh Genesis 3 1. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord and he said unto the woman hey and God said they shall not eat of every tree of the God okay stop there he is asking the woman a Christian he's saying as God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden he knows how to initiate conversation he knows how to work with the human he knows how to start a conversation amen and they are coming with reasonings in the end time so what do you think about the cloud of 63 what do you think about Revelation he's trying to open up that channel of communication that's what the shepherd was trying to do he knew if you went directly to the what he was going to tell her she would have shut him down but he's working walking now the reasoning Channel oh he says as God said You shall not eat your favorite tree of the God for the Joshua you read 216 let's see now we're now going back in chapter two to see what God really said Genesis 2 16. every tree of the garden thou mayest really 17 out of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eateth thereof thou shall surely die so God did not say you must eat mustn't eat of every tree right what did God say of every tree you can eat in the garden he said but at the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil thou must not eat so one tree they must not eat and the day you eat day off you shall surely die let's see so that was an interjection to remind you what God really said the question is asked me did God say man was eat not eat of every tree let's see if Eve responds correctly and if she's staying behind the word princess the Sarah from three two and three three [Music] so she answered correctly she quoted back the word of God this was not a deceived Church up until this point this was a woman was under subjection she knew the word of God she says no no she corrected him by her answer and said not every dream we made of all the fruits of the tree in the garden but of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die so she quoted back the word of God correctly this is where Satan now injects his own Doctrine all right and he injects his own reasoning and he takes God's Own word and he puts one word to it and it's a three four now and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die so here is introducing his own teaching and gospel is reasoning a new light that he is presenting and now he goes on to expand his teaching you know how some people do they take one quote of the prophet and they can preach an entire sermon based on the entire imagination foreign we've seen it how many of you can testify they'll take one quote and then the rest of it is vain imaginations watch now what he does he says for God not know in the day that you eat day off then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil they were already like God yes God said let us make man in our own image and likeness we just explained to you that Adam was an amateur God on the Earth he's saying you shall be like God now he says don't you want to know good and evil Revelation 5 5 says and one of the elders said to me weep not the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David and prevailed to open the book to loose the seals thereof that word prevailed means to be more powerful or more Superior how did he prevail what was the prevailing walk of the Lamb amen because when Adam lost the title to the Earth So Adam comes looking for his Queen he finds his Queen in a fallen condition he knows that when God comes in the cool of the day he's going to see Eve in this condition and he's going to kill her so in order to save Eve he comes to Eve's rescue amen and he shows his seed into Eve knowing that if his sin isn't if God cannot kill him because that seed is a part of hell so he does the work of a Kinsman to redeem his own bride now I want to tell you that the modern day people would have said divorce Eve but it was not so in the beginning Jesus said out of the oddness of your heart Moses commanded you to give a decree of divorcement was Adam entitled to divorce her did he have grounds to divorcer but it was not so in the beginning amen so he didn't divorce her God can now watch God comes into the garden and he's looking for his children and the Bible says he says Adam Adam where are thou because he couldn't find him in that Faith civilization anymore they were running to and fro in the garden trying to find coverings finally they found fig leaves it's nice big leaves they sold it together and they covered themselves with fig Leaf religion you know the rest of the story you can read it God looking at the condition of man and when man fell he got stripped off his power he got stripped off his inheritance and it went up back to God power over the Earth went back to God amen Fellowship was taken away and man lost eternal life so we see when the title deed went back to the original owner it was placed in the book of redemption and all the names that were supposed to come via the spoken word of Adam these names were placed in the book because these names were the ones that were in the back part of God's mind and these were the names that were predestined from before the foundation of the world amen let's go to the bridge message paragraph 228 talking now I'm skipping here because we got to go over time amen so I'm showing you the work of a redeemer now when God comes in the Garden of Eden he cannot go and do the work of a Kinsman because he's still in spirit form it's not your time for being to be manifested in the flesh everybody is following yes so in order to to to stay is right away because his wealth is so great that he will kill Adam and Eve for disobeying the world but he makes a partial atonement a temporary sacrifice it takes his lamb and he kills the lamb and his wrath is dead and he takes the skin off that lamb and he clothed the children and here they are not clothed bloody bleeding Lamb's skin cloth walking to Eden waiting for judgment amen Hallelujah it says in paragraph 228 the lamb is the only mediator he was the one that came forth he's been back here interceding until his blood out of tone for every person and the lamb knows what's written in the book aren't you glad that he knows your name amen that's why you are seated here this morning because he called my name he knew from the foundation of the world their names were in there so he stood back here and done the medatorial work till everyone that's been put in the book has been redeemed and it's finished [Music] it's a finished work it was the blood of the Lamb or the blood of the Lamb it was the blood of the Lamb amen that rescued me Sanctified me cleanse me delivered me [Music] amen so yes there's one amen the Bible describes him as having seven horns and seven eyes the prophet in 231 will go to describe what these horns are he says that this was the protection to a seven Church ages seven arms with the seven churches the ages because that was the Lamb's protection we didn't make it on our own strength Paul didn't make it in his own strength neither did iranius Martin Luther Colombo Wesley Branham make it on their own strength but it was the protection of the Lamb those seven arms have been protecting the Saints he says he protected his rights on Earth was a God sent group of people that protected sea the Horn of the Lamb aren't you glad that we are under the protection of the arm and the Seven eyes amen seven eyes have been watching two seven Church ages guiding the church what are these seven eyes the seven messengers of God two of the seven Church ages the seven seers amen this lamb had seven arms on each on at an eye amen what is it Christ and his bride Hallelujah amen this should be the name of the Lord did you catch it amen God's protection coming over the church amen let me say it again the lamb had seven horns that's seven olives he says were the seven Church ages and he says seven eyes who are these seven eyes messages Prophets follow my thoughts where is the eyes in the head or in the body hello come on now are these seven messages a part of the Royal Queen of Heaven that's why he emphasizes the next point there and he says Christ and his bride amen the protection is coming via the body that's why you've got to receive a prophet you received a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward amen God who is blessing the church God is protecting the church but the protection is coming to the party so you cannot reject the eyes that were coming he says Christ and the bride seven Church ages out of there were seven prophets that were sent forth seven seers the last one must be a Seer amen so we find that no Angelic being go to 238 no Angelic being could take the place either it could only be the bloody Lamb of God that could walk out amen and take this now hear what the prophet says here brother this is the most Sublime thing in the scripture he says out of all scripture this is the most Sublime thing in Scripture because this was supposed to be done in Eden the claiming work the most Sublime thing remember in Eden it was a partial temporary remedy manner to continue powerless on the Earth how many of you know I have for Abraham being Miracles show me in the Bible Isaac bring miracles operating in power and authority show me Jonah did all of him die so they didn't have eternal life so bear that to live for 4 000 years until Jesus Christ came in on the scene powerless the only blessing that man had was because God had made a covenant with men and if they kept his word they would be blessed but they had no Authority and power over the Earth they were dying and going down through the grave so no angel could do it 239 he says it belongs to the lamb God's law required he's the one to hold it he required the Kinsmen Redeemer and the lamb come out holding it he says I am the Kinsman I am the Redeemer I made intercession for them now I have come to claim their rights for them even this morning some people are not taking back their rights but I want you to know that lamb has come to claim it on your behalf amen the lamb has already claimed you're healing on your behalf now you've got to take it amen listen to what he says I've come to claim their rights for them because there was just a search down and you couldn't go and claim it I can't Proclaim it on their behalf amen there's only one I've come to claim their rights they have a right to everything that lost in the fall I've paid the price I am the mediator my blood was shed I have become man and I did this in order to get that church back again the one I first saw before the foundation of the world I purposed it I spoke it amen nobody was able to take it but I went down and done it myself I am the Kinsman I become kinsful and he takes the book 243 he says what a Sublime statement or act Sublime means inspirational beautiful amen so we do not have to give our allegiance to the Pope we do not have to give our allegiance to the Imam the grand Iman do you know just September in September they met again and they signed the final document I'm talking about the religious world right the pope met with all the leaders of the world so what the prophet prophesied that the spoke will do they have signed the final document I want you to go listen to it the final document that was signed where the pope is speaking and watch how they're addressing governments and they're telling politicians what they expect of them right the last time we preached on this we we just we told you that in order to control the world's population you cannot control them through politics because man is very religious them billions of Catholics millions of Muslims Christians so if you control them through religion it's easier than controlling them because politics is one man's idea you got Democrats you've got Republicans you got the Socialists you've got so many different things going on but when they come now and they say that we are all of one religion we all serve the same God we can unite under this why are you fussing about he's saying all of us are praying to the one God that's what the pope is saying and you know about that new church that's being built where they got a mosque you know a church and a Jewish temple the synagogue right I know so when is 255 let's go quick now and close up he says let's follow this now sometimes you know the property same things but we got to read it slow he says now he comes from here at this last seal did you get it what is the last seal there's only seven right Seven Seals so it's the seventh seal so is that now apart so what is he talking about Revelation 5 coming to take the book claim it so Revelation 5 is linked to Revelation 10 bringing the book to the Earth yes so the last seal is what there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour but we are not seeing the silence right now because everyone is screaming they're shouting Worthy is the Lamb because that was slain so that's not the silence in Revelation 5. Revelation is very noisy right but he's tying this to that seventh seal there's something that causes heaven to be silent yes he says and now he comes from here at the last at this last seal his normal mediator he is King now what does he do if he's King he has to have subjects by God's grace I believe some of them are sitting here this morning and his subjects his name that has been redeemed have we been redeemed amen they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption now he walks forth from a mediator where death put us in the grave he comes forth with the rights amen then 266 he says the seals was broke in the last Church age so now he's typing something here when was the seals broke in the LA in the seven churches to reveal these truth the lamb broke the seals revealed it to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his brain he wants to bring his subjects to him now 268 he comes to get his subjects he revealed his Secrets they saw it amen amen amen yes you got it 268. listen to what he says he came he came to get his subjects did he hear him come or church yes did he come to get his subjects he revealed his Secrets yes was the mystery of God revealed amen and all the other lucians and they saw it where is he now if you read the next line you know exactly what chapter he's in and he says at and time is no more at that time he's in Revelation 10. when the angel lifts up his hand to heaven he says time has run out it's finished he leaves the throne to be an intercessor as a slain lamb to be a lion king to bring the world to judgment who has rejected his message yes amen follow his thought now amen the prophet says when he came down to execute amateur tribulation upon the people amen Hallelujah let me tell you something if it had not been for Revelation 10 the serpent at the end would have swept you up look at all the churches are deceived but I want you to know amen as he was about to deceive you and come to make his final move on you down comes the angel of Revelation 10 and he shuts those beasts up [Music] amen now watch if you didn't catch what I was saying there how did he infiltrate Eden through a serpent how was he infiltrating the nations of the earth and deceiving them through true beasts to the Roman Catholic church and through the USA because God's Avenue is always to walk with man and take me is a copycat so he also works through Myan now okay so he comes to shut down those two systems amen answer what until judgment he said like Daniel said 272 he says no we're not the same shall judge the Earth judgment was said books were open Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands of thousands ministered to him king and queen and then another book was open which was the book of life that's for the church and the queen and king stood there notice Royal titles being used this is the hour for the Royal Queen of Heaven and the royal king of Heaven to be United amen amen 278 let's just finish on this now he says he leaves the throne as an intercessor right bring to bring the world into judgment now watch I gotta drop this in quickly so that you tie it in when the prophet is receiving these messages and you remember you threw that rock up in the air and he says judgment is fixing to strike right and he says Alaska almost sunk he says that was amateur tribulations and he says and it won't stop okay so if you're wondering where's tribulation what do you think is going on in the world right now now the reason why we are focusing on this if Russia is so fixed on fulfilling their part of the prophecy if the U.S is so fixed on fulfilling their part of the prophecy if the pope is so fixed and they are hard at work in uniting all the religions of the world and fulfilling their part of the prophecy this bride must be fixed and set her heart on her part of the prophecy amen amen he says here in choose 279 then claims his inheritance what's his inheritance the church the bride he claims it in 280 then he disposes of his contestant Satan he throws him in the lake of fire with all those things which inspired by Satan to reject his word of redemption he is King now Mercy is still on the throne oh for those of you who thought I was saying that when he left the throne and mercy was over no no no no no no Mercy is wherever the lamb goes [Music] amen isn't he's telling you now he's King now Mercy is still on the throne don't you reject his offer even this morning don't you reject his offer amen so you can you can read what a time of rejoicing there was in heaven now to bring this to a close let's close this now in maybe a minute or two Adam was looking for his Queen and he found it in the Fallen condition when this bride when this last Adam he's not the second Adam the Bible called him actually the last era when this last Adam comes in the end of time the church is supposed to be built out for seven Church ages and he comes looking for his Queen he finds it in a condition miserable wretched naked blind and the Bible says you don't even know it and he's knocking at the door open up to me trying to cover herself but there's a very significant portion let's go to Revelation 3 22 then 321. there's a portion there that is tied to us because there's a remedy for that woman that's in that condition and that's what we have done amen let's go to verse 18. so 17 says talks about the woman and the condition she was in right saying I'm increased with Goods that need of nothing but thou wretched miserable poor blind naked but here's the remedy I counsel of Thee just like Adam didn't put away Eve he was trying to reason with him he says I counsel of Thee bye of me gold tried in the fire that thou makes me Rich white Raymond that thou Mays be clothed that the shame of your nakedness do not appear and anoint that eyes with eye self that thou mayest see amen look at Father's Love even right at the end when he finds her like a prostitute yeah and he says as many as I love I just rebuke and I chase them if you're finding my words hard and offensive even week after week from all the preachers he's saying if you find this rebuke God I love you I rebuke you I chasing you be zealously off and repent amen even in that condition Jesus is reaching out to them Oh What A Savior this is what a redeemer looking for his Queen and then he gives them the promise about overcoming he's saying if you overcome you can sit with me in my throne amen so he when he's coming to take the title deed in Revelation God is Not content that the title deed is reclaimed and the lamb himself is not happy to just take everything for himself but the same God that came down to find Adam in the cool of the day came down in Revelation 10 to find a people that he can take the title deep back to and what is he coming to do he is coming to empower Batman he's coming to re-empower man and put him back in his ought to be condition this is what the work of Redemption is all about to pay the price of redemption so that man can be restored back to power and authority over the Earth have eternal life and fellowship with God now he comes to take his bride amen let's go to 229 there in the bridge he says he comes to take his bride he comes as Queen he is look he comes as king he is looking for his Queen in this book is the whole secret of it wrapped up around Seven Seals and I want you to know only we have this revelation of the Seven Seals amen Satan cause if fall but God came to empower this Eve with full Authority and dominion over the Earth God is one who empowers his people this is the type of King he is he empowers his Queen he wants man his bride to operate from the position he placed them in with the authority that was given to them amen he has come down in Revelation 10 looking for his Queen and he found her he located her and he told her take this book of redemption and eat your part it couldn't have been one man that ate the book if one man hit the book then how are you going to eat but John typed the bride so you eat your portion and you become everything that God manifested you to be on the earth I leave my portion and become everything that God manifested me to be on the Earth I'll prophesy my part you prophesy your past amen and together we are this one big powerful Queen and that's the rise that's the fall of a queen in Eden and there's the rise of a queen in Satan's Eden amen the rise of the most glorious queen that you will ever see and you know what he said this people I'm gonna take them out in style when I go to pick up to take it to the wedding some like horses and chariots and some like the Lamborghini and some like the drop top when they're going to the wedding supper I'm going to provide a transportation
