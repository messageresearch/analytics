[15:31] and mighty name of our lord and savior
[15:33] jesus christ amen
[15:43] that's a pretty good idea okay
[15:46] we have a subject matter here this
[15:47] morning
[15:49] on the gene of god the genealogy of god
[15:51] the gene of god amen amen
[15:54] and i trust the lord who wrote the word
[15:56] and anything that we need to say
[15:58] we need to say what the prophet said
[16:01] you know
[16:02] anything
[16:03] and uh and if there's any
[16:06] uh mystery or revelation
[16:09] or whatever it's got to be scriptural
[16:11] amen and it's going to be understanding
[16:13] hallelujah i believe that we are
[16:16] the children of god amen and we'll catch
[16:19] the revelation yes we'll catch that
[16:21] mystery with the understanding that god
[16:24] has in store amen
[16:26] amen you've got your bible we'll turn to
[16:29] the book of genesis
[16:31] chapter one
[16:34] hallelujah amen
[16:37] you know many times we read the bible
[16:40] but we need to read the bible with the
[16:42] understanding yeah that god has given us
[16:45] the prophet has given us yes because the
[16:47] prophet unveils
[16:49] unfolds
[16:50] and give to us the word of life that we
[16:52] may be sustained amen
[16:55] praise the lord hallelujah
[16:57] glory to god
[16:59] and the bible says in genesis 1 26
[17:05] the bible says
[17:06] and god said
[17:08] this is what god said amen
[17:11] nobody else god said
[17:13] let us make man in our image
[17:16] now i want you to catch the concept
[17:19] of what god has said
[17:21] in terms
[17:22] of what the word says and we go further
[17:25] amen
[17:26] after our likeness
[17:28] and let them have dominion over the fish
[17:31] of the sea and over the flower of the
[17:34] egg and over the kettle and over all the
[17:37] earth and over every creeping thing that
[17:40] creepeth upon the earth
[17:42] is that what the bible says amen but now
[17:45] when he says let us and god said let us
[17:47] make man in our image we need to
[17:50] understand the genealogy and the
[17:53] phraseology of the genesis account of
[17:57] what he is trying to say to us and the
[18:00] only way that we could understand is
[18:02] this is through a prophet through the
[18:04] prophet of malachi 4 revelation 10 1-7
[18:09] what has been written and how it has
[18:12] been unrailed in the ministry of a
[18:15] prophetic ministry that has come our way
[18:18] yes amen
[18:20] 27.
[18:21] so god created man
[18:24] in his own enemy
[18:26] first he said let us make man in our
[18:29] image
[18:31] but in 27 it says so god created man in
[18:35] his own image
[18:38] in the image of god created he him male
[18:42] and female created
[18:45] them
[18:46] shall we pray
[18:47] dear heavenly father
[18:50] your words has been read
[18:53] it takes your spirit
[18:54] to unveil
[18:56] what's in your word of god
[18:58] it's been laying there for 6 000 years
[19:01] but father
[19:02] this morning
[19:04] at the son of man revealed ministries we
[19:07] pray dear god that you may yet again
[19:10] unveil the hidden mystery amen of god
[19:14] into
[19:15] the children of your praise
[19:17] may you use the mortal lips of clay
[19:20] that's standing in the helpdesk of god
[19:22] that when you speak father the
[19:25] theophonic words of your realization be
[19:28] made manifest through the spirit to the
[19:31] children of your praise bless us now
[19:33] father we turn the service over to you
[19:36] in jesus christ's name and all shall say
[19:39] amen praise the lord you may take the
[19:41] comfort of your sin amen
[19:55] hallelujah amen
[20:00] yes he's just prepared again just to get
[20:02] in on the body
[20:04] praise the lord amen you're happy amen
[20:07] and i'm so glad
[20:10] that uh the church out here is
[20:12] progressing yes in revelation and in
[20:14] shock
[20:15] i'm so glad to hear many messages that
[20:17] are coming on the help desk of god
[20:20] that god is using the ministers in the
[20:22] church testimonies in the church amen
[20:25] amen and uh having uh
[20:28] your pastor here and having the rest of
[20:31] the ministers that are here i'm so glad
[20:33] that uh things are taking a new turn and
[20:36] bringing you all into a condition that
[20:38] you could be conditioned for the great
[20:41] rapture the grandchildren could be
[20:43] instilled in in your amen
[20:46] so it takes the grace of god
[20:48] and the power of god
[20:50] and the gift of god that is in you to
[20:53] bring to pass those things that god has
[20:56] instilled
[20:57] amen
[20:58] in each and every one of you amen i'm so
[21:01] glad that even brother ramesh i never
[21:02] knew that he was a good song leader
[21:06] i should have stolen him from those days
[21:07] in the stream
[21:09] and i gave the message and then he gave
[21:10] me a hebrew book i see he's standing out
[21:13] here like a hebrew the coaches just
[21:16] coming in and just singing the
[21:19] the wonderful psalms and the the songs
[21:22] that just to create an atmosphere of
[21:24] worship
[21:25] it takes that great gift to be made
[21:27] manifest amen
[21:39] so we want to speak okay as we're
[21:40] getting ready we want to speak about the
[21:42] gene of god
[21:44] amen
[21:45] now
[21:46] here we find in the book of genesis
[21:49] in the beginning
[21:52] god created the heavens and the earth
[21:55] quite correct
[21:57] and then we find in john 1 1 it says in
[22:00] the beginning was the word the word was
[22:03] with god and the word was god
[22:07] and the word must be fresh and dwelt
[22:09] amongst us i'm not quite correct now
[22:12] when we look at these things with these
[22:14] things the the word of the lord and the
[22:16] understanding of the word of the lord
[22:18] and we find that the blade was
[22:21] predestinated before the foundation of
[22:23] the
[22:24] world so if the blind was predestinated
[22:28] before the foundation of the world then
[22:30] we need to have some format
[22:33] of understanding the predestinated
[22:36] will of god in our lives that we are
[22:40] called unto the mystical body the church
[22:44] of the living god the bride of jesus
[22:46] christ amen
[22:48] so now
[22:51] we just okay
[22:56] praise the lord amen
[23:01] hallelujah amen
[23:05] all right praise the lord amen
[23:12] so we need to know who god is
[23:15] we need to know who we are
[23:17] amen if we know who we are
[23:20] through the message through christianity
[23:23] we will know god we will understand god
[23:26] and we will know how to worship him and
[23:29] praise him and all the contexts are you
[23:31] would be in our judgment
[23:33] so
[23:34] now what i'm trying to tell you is this
[23:36] that god
[23:38] is a great god
[23:40] and god
[23:46] god is an object of worship amen
[23:49] before he needed to worship he had
[23:51] something in his mind
[23:54] he had you in his mind yes
[23:57] and if he had you in his mind
[24:00] he need to do something
[24:02] to bring you on this side of eternity
[24:06] right
[24:07] from
[24:08] celestial
[24:10] to telesco
[24:11] so that the terrestrial will understand
[24:14] the
[24:15] celestial concept the theophonic concept
[24:19] of of the word of god
[24:21] and then the understanding that comes to
[24:24] you now even as we have read the word of
[24:27] god in genesis 1 26 and
[24:31] and god said let us make man in our
[24:34] image yes amen
[24:36] the thought of bringing this man
[24:39] in our image
[24:41] was a twofold thought
[24:43] of
[24:44] expression why do you say this process
[24:47] because he said and i and he said
[24:51] let them have dominion of the fish of
[24:53] the sea is it natural yes
[24:57] when they say let us make man
[24:59] in our image was it natural or spiritual
[25:04] so he had a
[25:07] concept
[25:08] of dividing
[25:10] his spirit
[25:12] from the spiritual
[25:14] to the natural so that the natural could
[25:17] work out the natural
[25:19] and realize that there is something that
[25:23] god has
[25:24] in store for us
[25:26] amen okay
[25:30] the gene of god
[25:32] all right the first creation of man
[25:35] as a theophany being
[25:37] as a theophany being the first creation
[25:40] of man as a theophany being
[25:43] he was a spirit man he was the word body
[25:46] yes amen okay he said let us make man in
[25:49] our image and when we go into the
[25:52] concept of
[25:53] understanding what he said he spoke to
[25:56] the spirit and when they made that man
[25:58] in his image amen then he said let us
[26:01] make man in our own image yes
[26:05] you know if you realize who you are
[26:07] today hallelujah it will create an
[26:10] atmosphere
[26:12] of great
[26:13] worship amen of great understanding
[26:17] of great make a shift from the natural
[26:20] to the spiritual
[26:22] we cannot divide our attention to the
[26:25] things that god had in store for us yes
[26:30] there's no division there's no
[26:32] difference of opinion
[26:34] the same god with the same idea with the
[26:38] same mind as transposed his thoughts
[26:42] towards you and towards me
[26:44] through a prophetic ministry to come up
[26:47] higher
[26:48] in the realms of dimension so that we
[26:51] will be able to pick and understand the
[26:55] concept of god amen
[26:58] now when he said you let us make man
[27:01] in our image
[27:02] after our likeness
[27:06] let them have dominion
[27:08] over the fish of the sea
[27:10] over the fowl of the earth
[27:13] over every creeping thing that creeps
[27:15] upon the earth
[27:16] so god created man
[27:19] in his own image
[27:21] in the image of god created in him
[27:25] male and female created
[27:28] he again
[27:30] can you say amen amen
[27:32] [Music]
[27:33] all right praise the lord the second
[27:35] creation
[27:38] the second creation
[27:40] of man
[27:41] as a fresh being
[27:43] you
[27:44] and i
[27:46] watch
[27:48] and the lord god formed them at the dust
[27:51] of the ground
[27:53] and break unto his nostrils the breath
[27:56] of life
[27:57] and man became a living soul
[28:01] man became
[28:03] a living
[28:05] son amen
[28:06] okay
[28:07] the importance
[28:09] of that living show
[28:12] is something of vital importance to you
[28:16] and to me yes yes amen okay
[28:20] that show is our theophany
[28:23] when he brought that out in the
[28:25] beginning
[28:26] he said now he took from the ground
[28:29] he made this man
[28:31] and he made that perfect man am i quite
[28:33] correct
[28:35] yet after a while the genesis account he
[28:37] said
[28:38] it was not good for man to be
[28:42] alone so where was he
[28:46] eve was in the perfect man
[28:50] he was in the perfect man
[28:52] so god had a purpose
[28:55] in that purpose he had a plan in that
[28:58] plan he had a person veteran
[29:01] and the patent needs to be expressed by
[29:04] the plan
[29:05] so his fulfillment
[29:07] of what god has instilled to be made
[29:10] manifest that we may get the results to
[29:13] a prophetic ministry what has meant
[29:16] through the pages of the scriptures to
[29:19] unveil the characteristics of god in our
[29:23] life amen praise the lord amen
[29:26] hallelujah now we find
[29:29] that uh
[29:32] amen praise the lord
[29:34] the dean of god
[29:36] and the gene of man
[29:38] the gene of god is heavenly yes amen i
[29:42] believe we are heavenly yes we are
[29:45] seated in christ jesus in heavenly
[29:47] places
[29:48] brother branham says such a believer's
[29:50] position in christ amen so if we are in
[29:53] the believer's position in christ
[29:56] automatically we are alleviated from the
[29:59] natural cause to a spiritual dimension
[30:03] to hear from a theophany what he has
[30:05] installed in our soul so that we could
[30:09] have rejoicing in so many ways to know
[30:14] that he is a god of reality to make us a
[30:17] son and a daughter of god
[30:21] okay he the gene of god was heavenly
[30:24] the gene of land was empty
[30:27] there is a natural body
[30:30] and there is a spiritual body
[30:34] and so it is written the first
[30:37] the first
[30:38] man adam
[30:39] was made a living soul
[30:42] and the last adam was made a quickening
[30:46] spirit
[30:46] [Music]
[30:48] hallelujah
[30:50] let let your hearts be troubled
[30:53] you believe in god amen
[30:55] where i go
[30:56] you shall come also amen
[30:58] i will send you another comforter
[31:02] the comforter who is the comforter the

[33:21] that has been uh in us through our
[33:24] father and to our mother
[33:27] nobody can here can say that they didn't
[33:29] go to the doctors

[35:37] pass away
[35:38] we are the word bright if we have the
[35:40] white bread we have the word if we have
[35:42] the word
[35:49] amen
[35:50] for we know that if our earthly house of
[35:52] this tabernacle which is all we have a
[35:55] building of god you have a building of
[35:58] god and and house not made with hands
[36:03] not from your father and mother
[36:05] not made with hands
[36:08] eternally in the heavens
[36:11] so in this
[36:13] for in this we grow
[36:15] earnestly
[36:17] desiring to be clothed
[36:19] upon with the house which is from
[36:24] amen our desire a favorite desire to
[36:27] please god and cry to reach out in the
[36:31] try to reach out in the spirit and the
[36:34] passion to know his word that is why you
[36:37] are here is to know his word that is why
[36:40] you are here to exercise that word that
[36:43] is why you are here so that the word
[36:45] make manifest will be the very image
[36:49] succumbing to the things that god has
[36:51] instilled for you
[36:57] praise the lord
[37:00] now we come to you here
[37:02] who is this
[37:04] melchizedek
[37:06] now he says here
[37:09] you bypassed your theophany
[37:12] in the beginning now we have shown you
[37:14] the picture there was elohim
[37:17] hello him and his thoughts
[37:19] the expression
[37:20] he said the only way that i could make a
[37:23] way for the bride now and this is what
[37:25] i'm going to do
[37:28] but you have bypassed the tiafari
[37:31] and become fresh man
[37:34] to be tempted by sin
[37:37] how do you like that
[37:39] and then
[37:41] if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved
[37:45] we have one already waiting
[37:48] yes we have looked yet these bodies
[37:51] but the very fact
[37:53] that you are here
[37:55] you're exercising
[37:57] your god-given rights by rapturing faith
[38:01] to understand
[38:02] and to learn the concept
[38:05] of what the spirit is saying
[38:08] for you for today
[38:11] with the understanding with that
[38:13] understanding
[38:14] that you will develop
[38:17] like a character
[38:19] through the message of this hour
[38:21] to become that son and the daughter of
[38:24] god
[38:27] we have not yet in his bodies but god is
[38:29] preparing yeah
[38:33] he says but look
[38:36] where this body receives the spirit of
[38:39] god
[38:41] when this body
[38:42] your body
[38:44] receives the spirit of god
[38:47] the immortal life
[38:49] inside of you
[38:52] he throws this body
[38:54] in subjection to god amen
[38:58] that's why you say the things that i
[39:00] used to do i do them no more amen
[39:04] because your realization
[39:06] of godship of hatred
[39:08] is with an understanding that you need
[39:11] to live a life that is totally worthy of
[39:14] the gospel of jesus christ a life of
[39:17] righteousness yes a life that is
[39:20] pleasing unto god
[39:22] and amen praise the lord so
[39:26] okay now watch this
[39:30] has not taken
[39:32] place as we read here also yeah who is
[39:35] this
[39:38] and if you are here in the air which
[39:40] means speaks of one thing
[39:43] what is a parable a parable is an
[39:45] earthly story with a heavenly meaning
[39:48] amen what is
[39:50] the scripture the scripture
[39:52] requires a mystery requires a scripture
[39:56] brother branham brought that mystery in
[39:58] scriptural notation so that we will have
[40:01] a better understanding of what he has
[40:03] said and who is this melchizedek
[40:06] and if you are here in the air and it
[40:08] speaks about the rapture you take the
[40:11] you take the body to meet the theatre
[40:13] where you are and cut up and go to meet
[40:16] the lord in the air amen so there will
[40:18] be a glorified body yes you will be
[40:22] there because now you understand you are
[40:25] going for the reading supper
[40:28] but you don't seem to understand you are
[40:31] married already amen
[40:33] amen if you are married already and if
[40:37] you're married to christ
[40:39] you put on a new nature amen you put on
[40:42] a new name yes your desires of the flesh
[40:45] go away amen your desire of the spirit
[40:48] comes in you are not in another
[40:50] engagement amen you change the seventh
[40:53] gear in overdrive you are moving into a
[40:56] highway of holiness where there's no
[40:59] bumps where there's no humps where
[41:02] there's no nothing your travel is a
[41:05] travel that god has entrusted you to go
[41:09] with and you are making the trouble a
[41:12] joyous one in the life that you are
[41:15] leading with your family today amen amen
[41:20] praise the lord
[41:21] are you happy amen
[41:25] the gene of god is celestial
[41:28] the gene of god is terroristic
[41:32] okay yes
[41:35] so now
[41:38] in first corinthians 15 40
[41:41] there is also celestial bodies
[41:45] god made sense to your bodies you know
[41:48] the nine planets
[41:49] uh
[41:52] uh saturn uranus neptune
[41:55] pluto and all these
[41:57] planets these are spear bodies and he
[41:59] also made terrestrial bodies yes you are
[42:02] celestial

[42:11] you are enjoying your work
[42:14] you are enjoying where you go
[42:16] you're enjoying what you're doing
[42:19] you understand amen but there is
[42:21] something in that enjoyment that you
[42:23] need to know
[42:25] you need to understand the concept of
[42:28] the word of god amen
[42:30] so when we are eating
[42:32] we are eating the word
[42:35] the nutrients of the word
[42:37] will have the values to succumb
[42:41] to your soul so that the nature
[42:44] of your soul will be
[42:46] the nature of god
[42:49] amen there won't be any difference yes
[42:52] don't be any different the church that
[42:53] is here in phoenix the church that is in
[42:56] australia the church that is in german
[43:00] and throughout the entire universe the
[43:02] world
[43:03] will have one revelation amen
[43:06] and that revelation must be scriptural
[43:09] yes that revelation that god has given
[43:11] through the prophets must stand amen
[43:14] there won't be any difference of opinion
[43:16] there won't be this and death i think so
[43:19] i will do this i will do that you take
[43:21] the word as it is
[43:24] you develop a sense the supersense in
[43:26] your life and the supersense will give
[43:29] to you the added advantage of what you
[43:32] need to know what was in those standards
[43:34] no one knows what we need to know it
[43:36] will take a profit
[43:38] and god bless you amen
[43:41] there are also celestial bodies and
[43:43] bodies telesteel
[43:45] but the glory of the celestial is one
[43:49] and the glory of the terestial is
[43:52] another
[43:53] are you with me church amen amen but
[43:55] when this it says but then when that
[43:59] body a kind of a celestial body when it
[44:02] returns back to the
[44:06] earth it picks up the substance that it
[44:10] once lived in yes amen
[44:15] you see we all have ones that are passed
[44:18] on
[44:20] that are in the graves
[44:22] okay are you with me hang on
[44:27] it is but then when that body a kind of
[44:30] a celestial body this is a kind of
[44:36] when it returns back to the earth
[44:39] it picks up the substance that it once
[44:41] lived in
[44:43] right it's once lived in
[44:47] we know first thessalonians 4 16
[44:50] when the trumpet of the lord shall sound
[44:53] amen
[44:54] who is going to rise amen
[44:58] that celestia will come
[45:01] and pick up
[45:04] like the cup and what does he say
[45:06] he picks up the substance that it once
[45:08] lived in and then it becomes a glorified
[45:12] body
[45:14] that body
[45:16] is the one that will see the lord jesus
[45:19] in his resurrected bodies
[45:22] now first thessalonians 4 16 and 17
[45:28] and the seventh seal will culminate yes
[45:32] in
[45:34] the manner in which we have just read
[45:38] and said it will be the physical
[45:41] corporal return of our lord jesus amen
[45:45] amen
[45:46] there are some that will not taste death
[45:49] that will be changed amen amen and the
[45:51] changing of your bodies into the
[45:53] glorification to go and have that
[45:56] wedding supper will be a joy that all

[46:02] a good white man
[46:04] i understood by revelation amen
[46:07] i moved in the word of god
[46:10] and god has made a way for me
[46:13] so the genealogy of god was being
[46:16] expressed in his thoughts in the
[46:18] manifestation as we go through and read
[46:22] to see it to say that what a perfect
[46:25] body that god has given you amen amen
[46:31] he gave a perfect spiritual
[46:34] body amen

[46:54] wonderful country you made me everything
[46:56] would be okay yeah i took my timer that
[46:58] did this but she won't say what curry
[47:00] powder what condiment she is till you

[47:16] the very same image of christ amen and
[47:19] the image of christ that is going to be
[47:21] exercised in your life and in my life
[47:24] through the son of man ministry where
[47:26] there will be the expression of god in
[47:30] this entire amen
[47:35] what your celestial body is somewhere
[47:38] else is what you are reflecting
[47:43] raise the lord brother sister
[47:45] in the spirit land what you are is what
[47:49] you are amen
[47:53] we could have done many things
[47:56] on a sunday morning yes
[47:59] but why we are not doing it
[48:02] because there is something
[48:04] inside of us telling us no matter what
[48:07] you know sometimes you'll get your
[48:08] husband but you know what's cool
[48:11] let's sleep
[48:12] with the blanket whatever it is no no no
[48:14] no we gotta go we report the chat

[48:40] from and where i am

[49:15] many ladies you spoke to your way
[49:18] how many ladies you spoke to your
[49:20] husband
[49:22] how many ladies you spoke to your mother
[49:25] how many lasers
[49:29] we were born in sin in
[49:31] shape and iniquity
[49:33] knowing what is wrong and still doing it

[49:39] visit that don't do this don't do that
[49:41] you still want to do it

[49:53] 2 7
[49:54] eve account amen that has come up where

[50:20] i have planted it
[50:22] apollo says wanted but it is god that

[50:28] in john first john 3 verses 9 who who
[50:32] whosoever is born of god does not commit

[51:09] we have a different nature
[51:12] we have a nature of god
[51:14] it's a sinless nature
[51:17] that is what people can't understand
[51:18] they brew history they give this to you

[52:14] and in that expression of self
[52:23] and then you are recharged
[52:26] by the spirit of almighty god where now
[52:29] the battery of the devil is running

[1:03:23] when we come to the fourth dimension
[1:03:26] sense
[1:03:28] we know what's the concept when you meet
[1:03:30] the heavenly bodies and all that kind of

[1:04:44] where celestial bodies of sinners go
[1:04:47] when they die
[1:04:49] that's where sinners go
[1:04:50] i'm not interested in denominations i'm
[1:04:52] not interested in all those kind of
[1:04:54] things they know where they go the
[1:04:55] sinners whatsoever they know where they
[1:04:57] go
[1:04:58] we have a lifestyle
[1:05:01] we have a dress code
[1:05:02] we have a word code amen we are being
[1:05:05] appetized by the word of god amen by the
[1:05:08] faithful ministry which have the same
[1:05:11] revelation of the word of god instilled
[1:05:14] in the gift of god to express the
[1:05:17] sentiment from the helpdesk of god for
[1:05:20] the nutrients of the congregants to
[1:05:22] build up the burden and to the stature
[1:05:25] of the perfect image of god
[1:05:28] amen
[1:05:33] then when it comes to sixth dimension
[1:05:35] paradise where celestial bodies of
[1:05:37] christians go when they die
[1:05:40] that's why we you know we before time
[1:05:43] god knows the time that you're born the

[1:06:11] see your loved one or whatever in the
[1:06:13] natural sense of what you're living look
[1:06:16] at the spiritual aspect of the sixth
[1:06:18] dimension where celestial bodies of
[1:06:20] christians go when they die
[1:06:22] and
[1:06:23] they are in a better place
[1:06:25] we are in a difficult place
[1:06:28] we await in the balance and found one
[1:06:30] thing right
[1:06:32] let the expression of our faith
[1:06:34] and the belief in the word
[1:06:37] expresses the spirit of righteousness
[1:06:40] that will succumb
[1:06:41] to our theophonic realization in the
[1:06:44] hope that we come from god and go to god
[1:06:48] amen come on our church
[1:06:51] then in the seventh dimension that's
[1:06:54] where god is
[1:06:55] now the gene of god possesses the zoe
[1:06:59] light
[1:07:00] you possess the zoe life

[1:07:13] aspect of the world
[1:07:16] the chin of god needs the new blood
[1:07:18] that's where we were but we need the new
[1:07:21] birth
[1:07:22] now let's see
[1:07:23] romans 8 30 moreover whom he did
[1:07:27] predestinate them he also called amen
[1:07:31] amen we were in him before the
[1:07:33] foundation of the world yes
[1:07:35] we were predestinated
[1:07:37] if we were predestinated he called us
[1:07:40] if he called us there was a call
[1:07:43] there was a trumpet call
[1:07:45] there was a jubilee call for you and me
[1:07:47] come on say amen
[1:07:49] so we are here not by mistake
[1:07:51] we are here not by mistaking the message
[1:07:54] we are here by the will and the purpose
[1:07:56] of god amen and the will and the purpose
[1:07:59] of god is to make sure that you get in
[1:08:02] the right church
[1:08:03] the recording faith that is instilled in
[1:08:06] your soul will succumb to the
[1:08:08] to the things of god according to
[1:08:11] scripture according to the message of
[1:08:14] the hour amen amen oh wonderful jesus
[1:08:19] wonderful jesus
[1:08:21] jesus answered verily verily i say unto
[1:08:24] thee
[1:08:25] except a man be born of war and of the
[1:08:27] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[1:08:30] of god
[1:08:31] what is the kingdom of god
[1:08:33] the kingdom of god
[1:08:35] is the word made power in you and me
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:40] is the word with power
[1:08:43] in you and in me
[1:08:48] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:08:50] and that which is born of the spirit is
[1:08:52] spilled
[1:08:54] so we born of the spirit
[1:08:57] we've been baptized in the name of jesus
[1:08:59] christ amen we received the new nature
[1:09:02] we transferred ourselves from the gene
[1:09:05] of man to the gene of god
[1:09:09] we have a zoe life amen and zoey life in
[1:09:12] the expression of god in this generation
[1:09:16] jesus christ on two feet again on this
[1:09:19] earth

[1:09:23] ministry
[1:09:24] jesus christ who is the word amen
[1:09:28] hallelujah amen let's go
[1:09:30] now the king of god is the real you you
[1:09:33] have a new nature
[1:09:34] the gene of man the negative view the
[1:09:37] only nature
[1:09:40] because now listen very carefully now
[1:09:43] give to me of your undivided attention
[1:09:47] let me ever think of what we don't mind
[1:09:50] give to me of your undivided attention
[1:09:58] praise the lord
[1:10:01] here this is what the prophet says in
[1:10:03] communion
[1:10:05] because i was born of charles and ella
[1:10:08] branham
[1:10:12] in the nature i was a sinner
[1:10:15] came to the world a liar
[1:10:18] and all the habits of the world
[1:10:20] laid right in me
[1:10:25] but down in there too
[1:10:30] but down
[1:10:31] in there too
[1:10:35] was another nature
[1:10:39] right
[1:10:41] was another nature
[1:10:45] present
[1:10:46] predestinated
[1:10:48] was in there
[1:10:50] was in there by god
[1:10:53] in the same body the two natures look at
[1:10:57] the diagram there
[1:11:00] the gene of god the genome in the two
[1:11:02] natures
[1:11:03] watch here what is real
[1:11:13] two natures in there well i only
[1:11:17] catered
[1:11:18] to one
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:21] you
[1:11:22] only
[1:11:23] catered for one he had the natural and
[1:11:28] the spiritual
[1:11:29] superimposed
[1:11:32] and now he divided
[1:11:35] the superimposed image
[1:11:39] to the dream
[1:11:41] of god
[1:11:42] which is the zoe life
[1:11:44] and you say amen amen
[1:11:46] as in good i good as a baby
[1:11:50] first thing you know i became a liar
[1:11:52] became everything else that's a sinner
[1:11:55] because i raised up that way but down in
[1:11:58] there was a little speck of life
[1:12:01] all the time hallelujah amen amen you
[1:12:05] are born in
[1:12:06] shape and iniquity come into this world
[1:12:09] speaking life
[1:12:10] but way down in there in the soul was a
[1:12:14] speck of light
[1:12:17] you never realized it till now that god
[1:12:20] was with you god was your robot god was
[1:12:25] monitoring you god was making a way for
[1:12:28] you you couldn't understand it
[1:12:31] so in the later later scriptures like a
[1:12:33] time he said when he was there matured
[1:12:37] and moving on into the word realm he
[1:12:39] says i am no more the son of charles and
[1:12:43] ella branham
[1:12:46] then paul said when it please god who
[1:12:49] separated me from my mother's womb i
[1:12:51] conferred not with spirits amen
[1:12:54] he knew the spirit that he had brother
[1:12:57] branham knew that the spirit that he had
[1:12:59] so he had to work out they had to work
[1:13:02] out the celebration with fear and in
[1:13:04] trembling by the predestination and will
[1:13:07] and aspect of god to know that they are
[1:13:10] the son and the daughter of god
[1:13:12] hallelujah
[1:13:13] a prophetic ministry has to be made
[1:13:16] manifest
[1:13:20] okay praise the lord
[1:13:22] let's go
[1:13:24] now watch i said give me your undivided
[1:13:27] attention
[1:13:28] the nature of your soul is
[1:13:32] two dots is god
[1:13:36] if you're born again
[1:13:39] if you're born again
[1:13:41] right the nature of your soul
[1:13:44] is of god
[1:13:46] you've got god inside of you
[1:13:50] amen
[1:13:52] say amen
[1:13:53] you've got god inside of you
[1:13:56] god is taking care of you yes
[1:13:59] god loves you
[1:14:01] god takes you to work
[1:14:03] god helps you in your family
[1:14:05] god supplies all your need according to
[1:14:07] the riches and glory
[1:14:09] god makes all these things for you
[1:14:11] because you're god inside of you
[1:14:17] then he says if it's not it's of the
[1:14:19] world
[1:14:21] but now watch what he says
[1:14:23] now what it says now watch it
[1:14:26] in this body we have this five
[1:14:29] uh senses that succumb to this body that
[1:14:33] brought you down all the time we don't
[1:14:34] want to delve into that
[1:14:36] once we got the baptism of the holy
[1:14:38] ghost the holy ghost makes way for you
[1:14:40] to the word and the word creates an
[1:14:42] atmosphere and a generic uh
[1:14:46] generic and a generic answer for you to
[1:14:49] know that god is pleased with you and
[1:14:53] god is making a way for you because you
[1:14:55] are for ordained of god
[1:14:57] so the body really now we are not
[1:14:59] interested in can you say amen
[1:15:02] amen
[1:15:03] that contacts the outside earth
[1:15:06] praise the lord amen the spirit now
[1:15:08] we're not interested
[1:15:10] memory conscience
[1:15:12] affection
[1:15:13] reasoning
[1:15:15] imagination we're not interested that
[1:15:17] takes you away
[1:15:19] you can be in the body you can be lost
[1:15:21] you can be in the spirit you can be lost
[1:15:23] but if you have the holy ghost you can't
[1:15:25] be lost amen come on now church you have
[1:15:28] your soul in your soul
[1:15:30] your soul is your control tower of faith
[1:15:32] or doubt amen right now he said the
[1:15:36] children is the soul and that's
[1:15:38] predestinated by god that's where the
[1:15:40] real seed germ lays is in death amen now
[1:15:46] watch this guy
[1:15:48] on the board satan
[1:15:50] what he's doing he's creating
[1:15:53] a man is creating doubt look at that
[1:15:56] arrow is going to doubt
[1:15:58] look at the gene of god what happens
[1:16:00] there and the word body where it comes
[1:16:02] to it comes to flint
[1:16:04] amen it comes to faith what type of
[1:16:07] thing like
[1:16:09] hallelujah
[1:16:10] that killing every faith lies in the
[1:16:12] message
[1:16:14] that should effect lies in their message
[1:16:16] we're not talking about the common faith

[1:19:10] creation that was made like this
[1:19:13] creation this way this manner in which
[1:19:16] god has prepared you to stand on the
[1:19:20] side of eternity
[1:19:24] but the main thing now
[1:19:25] is to the soul which will never die yes
[1:19:29] your will never die hurry

[1:19:47] with
[1:19:49] god amen amen
[1:19:52] can you see what i mean yeah
[1:19:55] your soul will never die
[1:19:58] it is not this outside sea tastes fear
[1:20:00] smell and here it
[1:20:02] isn't it's subject to death and will die
[1:20:07] but the inside part of you
[1:20:09] down in here inside that is a person
[1:20:12] that cannot die
[1:20:15] see
[1:20:16] and that's a person that the new life
[1:20:18] starts from
[1:20:20] from this new birth and it builds
[1:20:22] another person you are
[1:20:24] around that life
[1:20:29] that's why people can't understand you
[1:20:33] people can't understand you
[1:20:35] because
[1:20:36] they don't understand god
[1:20:39] we understand ourselves
[1:20:41] because we understand god
[1:20:44] you were never a sinner
[1:20:47] come and say amen
[1:20:51] you will never listen right
[1:20:54] let's see
[1:20:55] invisible unity
[1:20:58] you never sinned in the first place
[1:21:01] god don't even know
[1:21:04] it's the sea of forgetfulness
[1:21:06] you never did it
[1:21:09] you were accused of it by the accuser
[1:21:13] but really
[1:21:14] from the beginning you were
[1:21:16] predestinated to be a son of a daughter
[1:21:19] of god
[1:21:20] amen
[1:21:23] you are standing there washed
[1:21:25] and your old book of divorcements put
[1:21:28] away and is dead
[1:21:30] absolutely out of existence even in the
[1:21:35] mind of god
[1:21:39] god don't even remember
[1:21:40] it hallelujah god don't even remember it
[1:21:48] you are the virtuous bride of christ
[1:21:50] amen say amen amen what's in the blood
[1:21:53] of christ
[1:21:54] gracious
[1:21:55] virtuous sinless son of god staring with
[1:21:59] a pure unadulterated
[1:22:02] adulterated underdecorated redwood that
[1:22:05] he washed by the water
[1:22:07] of his own blood
[1:22:09] that became flesh and manifested that he
[1:22:12] might take you
[1:22:14] which were predestinated in the buddhism
[1:22:16] of the father before the beginning the
[1:22:19] same as he
[1:22:21] was amen
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:31] let's go further
[1:22:33] it's not your fault if you did anything
[1:22:36] who's going to blame you
[1:22:39] let's see
[1:22:42] how did you come to do this
[1:22:45] it's not your fault
[1:22:46] you are deceived into it by your first
[1:22:49] marriage
[1:22:50] to your
[1:22:51] adulterous parent e
[1:22:55] so
[1:22:56] nobody can say
[1:22:59] you come you did not convert it
[1:23:02] we come up here with this place
[1:23:04] because of you
[1:23:06] you look you're driving nicely you're
[1:23:08] looking through the window
[1:23:10] you carry on now what's that your eyes
[1:23:12] is going there
[1:23:14] and now you see all this in your way
[1:23:16] just gives you a bang there one time
[1:23:18] don't
[1:23:25] it's no fault of your own
[1:23:28] but your natural birth you come after e
[1:23:31] who committed adultery
[1:23:34] that's the reason you was born an adult
[1:23:38] you were a sinner to begin with
[1:23:40] say amen that's right
[1:23:43] you was deceived into it say amen
[1:23:46] you had no no it ain't your fault
[1:23:49] you never did it because that is the
[1:23:52] germ that was in you was to be you
[1:23:55] before the foundation of the world god
[1:23:57] put your name in the lamb's book of life
[1:24:00] hallelujah
[1:24:05] please be the god hallelujah
[1:24:08] amen and amen
[1:24:10] the bible said death if that soul won't
[1:24:13] do as it did say do he will even destroy
[1:24:16] the soul but
[1:24:18] you see
[1:24:19] he can't destroy himself
[1:24:23] and remain calm yes that's right
[1:24:25] so if that show is of the world it has
[1:24:28] to be destroyed but if it's eternal with
[1:24:31] god it never did begin
[1:24:34] because it's part of god
[1:24:36] it can never be destroyed amen the
[1:24:39] church ought to see you
[1:24:42] amen
[1:24:44] what the church had to see that
[1:24:49] now what i'm trying to tell you
[1:24:52] is define
[1:24:55] the laws
[1:24:56] of the genealogy

[1:25:15] rapturing faith
[1:25:17] in the spiritual sense of understanding
[1:25:21] that rapturing fate
[1:25:23] is instilled in us is making a way for
[1:25:26] us to develop
[1:25:28] the spiritual
[1:25:30] characteristics of god in us
[1:25:34] to move
