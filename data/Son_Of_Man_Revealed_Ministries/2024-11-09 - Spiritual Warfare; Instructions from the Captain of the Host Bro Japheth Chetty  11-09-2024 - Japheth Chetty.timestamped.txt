[0:00] amen everybody feeling good in the house
[0:01] of the Lord amen amen welcome you all in
[0:04] the precious name of our Lord and Savior
[0:06] Jesus Christ amen our sooncoming King
[0:10] he's worthy of the highest praise amen
[0:12] how many of you are looking forward to
[0:13] the service tonight amen our midweek
[0:15] service to come and worship the Lord in
[0:17] our prayer meeting amen where we come to
[0:19] pray and dedicate Our Lives to the Lord
[0:21] and also the prayer request amen of the
[0:24] Saints not only the local church but the
[0:26] Saints at large amen hallelujah so amen
[0:29] if you've seen what's happening amen all
[0:31] around us we can see the signs of the
[0:33] time all around us yes amen and if you
[0:38] noted the continuity of the messages
[0:40] that were coming out and also what is
[0:43] happening in the physical Israel you'll
[0:45] see everything is falling in
[0:47] line amen so there was just something I
[0:51] needed to say Amen on Sunday because I
[0:52] was kind of rushing through the end part
[0:55] you know when the pool is here and then
[0:57] you don't get to your message but then
[1:00] if you notice I took like 5 minutes at
[1:02] the end to explain the Philadelphia
[1:04] Corridor amen
[1:07] so I in my opening statements you
[1:10] remembered I told you that USA under aab
[1:14] Prophet says was typing Israel amen
[1:18] hallelujah so I was trying to show you
[1:20] that the Philadelphia border is
[1:21] affecting physical Israel spiritual
[1:24] Israel which is us and USA and what I
[1:29] meant to tell you was that Philadelphia
[1:31] is very important in the US elections
[1:34] right if you
[1:37] watch if you watch where they held the
[1:39] debate yesterday it was in Philadelphia
[1:42] amen so it's another Corridor they
[1:44] realize in the USA that's the corridor
[1:47] they got to get to win the
[1:49] election physically Israel has got to
[1:52] guard the Philadelphian Corridor and
[1:54] spiritual Israel the six Church AG we've
[1:58] got to guard that brotherly love
[2:00] Corridor amen so you can see all three
[2:02] things are tying in line Lord and one of
[2:04] the things they said that you remember
[2:06] the 100 ostriches were already released
[2:09] now netan if you look listen to his
[2:10] speech he says the moment we attacked
[2:14] Rafa the moment we went after Rafa they
[2:17] released the hostages the moment we went
[2:19] after healing Rafa means healer the
[2:22] moment we engaged healing demon powers
[2:25] up to hallelujah amen hallelujah amen so
[2:28] I just needed to tell you that amen that
[2:30] these three things are happening the
[2:32] Philadelphia amen election amen they
[2:34] must win Pennsylvania Philadelphia to
[2:37] win the election amen and they must
[2:39] guard Philadelphia and if you not to
[2:42] there six hostages were found
[2:44] Philadelphia is a six Church Age The
[2:46] Prophet says it's an overlap to the
[2:48] seventh Church age he says the seventh
[2:51] Church age is a very short age it's a
[2:53] overlap a continuation of that sixth
[2:55] stage which is brotherly love amen and
[2:59] it's very important because you find
[3:01] Brotherly Love is a thing that is
[3:03] lacking amen Brotherly Love is the thing
[3:07] that is lacking but we've got to protect
[3:09] that Corridor we've got to guard that
[3:11] amen let's stand together as we receive
[3:13] amen our brother Jeff who's going to
[3:14] share the word of the Lord amen you just

[5:57] as we go to war because we you know that
[6:00] your Prophet Tau us Lord when the word
[6:01] has been spoken oh God there is a war
[6:04] that takes place in the spiritual realm
[6:06] oh godu and so father right now we take
[6:08] control of every Spirit oh God every
[6:10] hindering spirit that we want to come
[6:12] Lord and hinder the service tonight
[6:14] father we cast it out in Jesus name
[6:17] father for it is written whatever we
[6:18] bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven
[6:21] amen whatever we loose on Earth shall be
[6:23] Loos in heaven and Lord father I pray
[6:25] Lord that the minds of your people now

[6:49] bread oh god father I pray you silence
[6:51] me oh God to my own thoughts my own
[6:54] opinions my own desires oh God and I
[6:57] pray that you will speak tonight in
[6:58] Jesus name father we ask these things oh
[7:01] Lord amen amen hallelujah amen amen
[7:05] let's open to the word of God
[7:10] hallelujah amen let's turn to First
[7:13] Timothy chapter
[7:18] 1 amen so as I said I was not here on
[7:21] Sunday so I did not hear what was
[7:24] preached on
[7:25] Sunday
[7:27] amen so and neither did I listen to the
[7:29] recording because it hasn't been
[7:31] uploaded as yet amen but I'm excited
[7:35] because after preparing my message
[7:38] yesterday I spoke to
[7:40] pastor and he told me that on Sunday he
[7:43] preached on the Amen on the Philadelphia
[7:46] Corridor and the three
[7:48] goals amen and the message that the lord
[7:51] gave me is directly in line with
[7:53] that so you might hear me repeating a
[7:56] few things that you've already heard
[7:59] amen but that's just the angel of the
[8:01] Lord confirming amen because like I said
[8:04] I haven't heard anything of what was
[8:06] preached on
[8:07] Sunday and you will see exactly what has
[8:09] been spoken tonight even by Pastor is
[8:11] even in my notes amen so you'll see that
[8:13] the angel of the Lord is confirming the
[8:15] same thing amen
[8:17] amen amen so let's just be attentive to
[8:20] the Lord you know sometimes the Lord
[8:21] uses can use a different gift to bring
[8:24] things in different ways amen but the
[8:26] inspiration is drawing from the same
[8:28] Fountain amen so first Timothy
[8:32] 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[8:35] Commandment of God Our Savior and Lord
[8:38] Jesus Christ which is Our Hope verse two
[8:42] unto Timothy my my own son in the faith
[8:46] grace mercy and peace from God our
[8:49] Father and Jesus Christ Our Lord so Paul
[8:51] is addressing this letter this letter to
[8:53] Timothy and he's calling Timothy his own
[8:56] son in the faith in other words Timothy
[8:59] had come into a place of sunship to Paul
[9:02] Timothy had come into a place of
[9:04] adoption amen he had come to a sunship
[9:07] amen Verse 18 Paul now says uh to him
[9:12] this charge I commit unto thee and again
[9:14] he calls him
[9:16] son according to the prophecies which
[9:19] went before on thee am man so Paul is
[9:22] telling him that there's been prophecies
[9:23] over your life yes there's been
[9:26] prophecies that has gone on over this
[9:28] bride amen Hallelujah that thou by them
[9:33] by what by those prophecies mightest War
[9:36] a good Warfare amen amen so Paul is
[9:39] telling him you are not called to a
[9:41] flowery bed of ease but Paul is telling
[9:44] him you are called to Warfare amen and
[9:46] he saying by these prophecies that have
[9:48] been prophesied over your life why good
[9:52] Warfare so the bride of Christ now is
[9:54] coming into sunship coming to adoption
[9:58] and there's been prophecies over this
[9:59] bride yes amen but by those prophecies
[10:02] now this bride is called to Warfare amen
[10:05] this bride is called to spiritual war
[10:07] amen she is not called yet just to play
[10:09] church amen but she is called into
[10:11] spiritual warfare amen so God add His
[10:14] blessings to the reading of the word you
[10:15] may be seated amen amen amen and for a
[10:19] topic tonight we want to just speak on
[10:21] strategic Warfare instructions from the
[10:24] captain of the host amen amen
[10:27] instructions from the captain of we know
[10:29] who the captain of the host is is the
[10:31] Angel of the Lord and we know who the
[10:33] angel is because we've been walking with
[10:35] him amen we connected to the angel amen
[10:38] and in this end time there has to be a
[10:40] connection to that angel amen there
[10:43] can't just be a connection to a church
[10:46] messenger there has to be a connection
[10:49] to the angel who brought the message to
[10:51] the messenger amen so Paul here is amen
[10:56] can I say handing over the the batt to
[11:00] to his son Timothy he's referring in
[11:02] referring to him in
[11:05] sunship because Paul you know was the
[11:07] first church a messenger and he was like
[11:10] a fatherly figure to Timothy yeah and
[11:13] Paul brought him up into spiritual
[11:15] maturity teaching him the foundational
[11:17] things of Christianity bringing him into
[11:19] a strong foundation so that he could
[11:21] grow up spiritually amen amen yes and so
[11:25] now when Paul is addressing this letter
[11:27] to him he is telling him that amen he is
[11:32] charged amen he's giving Timothy a
[11:34] charge amen it's just not a normal
[11:36] letter but he's giving him an
[11:38] instruction a charge yes and he's saying
[11:40] that you have to fight a good Warfare
[11:42] amen amen you cannot just sit with what
[11:45] I've thought you but you have to fight
[11:48] this war amen amen now you'll find
[11:51] usually in adoption there is usually a
[11:54] passing of the Baton there's usually a
[11:57] passing over you know in the when when
[12:00] we hear of the parable of adoption in
[12:02] the old tradition the father when the
[12:05] son comes up to a stage of maturity the
[12:08] father now wants to pass on the Baton to
[12:10] the son he wants to pass on the business
[12:12] the family name and so forth The
[12:14] Inheritance to the son there's a passing
[12:16] on and in so doing he passes he passes
[12:20] on his inheritance he passes on his
[12:23] status he passes on his authority amen
[12:26] and we find that this pattern happens
[12:28] throughout the Bible you'll see for
[12:30] example with Elijah and Elisha Elijah
[12:33] now passes on the mantle to
[12:35] Elisha and so Elisha is now robed with
[12:38] this mantle amen he's passing on the
[12:41] Baton to him and now Elisha is able to
[12:44] fulfill a double portion of the ministry
[12:47] because the Bon has been passed to
[12:50] him amen you'll see that for example in
[12:53] Jacob and Joseph Jacob puts on a Cod of
[12:56] Many Colors on on Joseph
[12:59] and he passes on the B to Joseph and we
[13:02] know Joseph tpes Perfection Joseph comes
[13:05] up into spiritual maturity into
[13:08] Perfection you see there's always a
[13:10] passing on in
[13:11] adoption you see with Moses and
[13:15] Joshua Moses passes on the torch to
[13:18] Joshua and then Joshua comes into an
[13:20] Ephesian amen Joshua comes into
[13:22] spiritual maturity Joshua comes into his
[13:25] position and then when he comes into his
[13:28] position he's able to speak he's able to
[13:30] control things the the he's able to
[13:32] control nature he's able to fight Wars
[13:35] am but notice how when the Baton is
[13:38] passed and adoption comes it brings you
[13:40] to Warfare
[13:44] [Music]
[13:45] amen amen so just like that now Paul now
[13:48] he's passing it on to Timothy and he's
[13:50] saying I charge you to fight a good
[13:52] Warfare but you're not just to fight
[13:54] anyhow you are to fight this Warfare
[13:57] with the prophecies that has already
[13:59] gone over your life amen amen because
[14:02] there's prophecies that this bride will
[14:03] be an invincible Army Hallelujah you see
[14:06] there's prophecies amen that this bride
[14:08] amen that Satan will not be able to
[14:10] touch this bride he said this bride will
[14:13] not fall like the first bride did amen
[14:15] amen but there's prophecies that this
[14:17] bride will succeed will overcome because
[14:20] the Bible says to him that overcometh
[14:22] will I grant to sit on my Throne so who
[14:25] is to fulfill that it's the bride of
[14:28] Christ
[14:29] so as the blood is coming into
[14:32] adoption there's a there's been a
[14:34] passing on you see there was a prophet
[14:37] in the age who came to spiritual
[14:39] maturity as the first wave sheep being
[14:41] waved amen he comes so much into
[14:45] spiritual adoption that amen even one
[14:47] day he started to have a body change
[14:49] amen amen he started to have an
[14:51] experience of a change amen but amen God
[14:54] had to take him off the scene but in so
[14:55] doing he passes on the torch to us amen
[14:59] the Bride of the age because he said the
[15:01] bride under a Messenger will be the
[15:03] final voice to the final age so he
[15:06] passes on the torch to the bride of
[15:07] Christ and so the bride in this passing
[15:10] over now also has to come into adoption
[15:13] but why because she has to come into
[15:15] spiritual warfare there's a war that's
[15:17] taking place and you cannot have little
[15:20] children fighting in a war they've got
[15:22] to be spiritually mature Sons and
[15:24] Daughters of God they've got to be
[15:26] trained in battle amen they've got to be
[15:29] experienced amen they got to have a
[15:32] backside of a desert experience David
[15:34] before he could face Goliath had to have
[15:36] his experiences now that was the
[15:39] difference that is what gave David the
[15:41] confidence to go and face Goliath it
[15:44] might have been a different story maybe
[15:45] if David never had no experiences but
[15:48] now David was able to go into war
[15:50] because of those
[15:52] experiences you see so in order for you
[15:54] to get into this war you have to come
[15:56] into spiritual adoption
[15:59] you cannot come as a baby in Christ and
[16:01] now go straight into battle the Lord
[16:03] takes you through a training camp and
[16:06] who's the general of the army amen is
[16:07] the Angel of the Lord amen he starts you
[16:10] off on boot camp because who's the guide
[16:12] who's the choor amen starts you up from
[16:15] a young age and and he's bringing you up
[16:17] bringing you up but when you reach a
[16:19] certain level where you are not able to
[16:21] enter the Army to fight amen he's no
[16:24] longer a tutor he's not the general of
[16:26] the army and now he's giving out Maring
[16:29] orders amen amen and now you have to
[16:33] take marching orders if you are in the
[16:35] Army amen you cannot have a soldier
[16:38] who's trying to pull rank yes amen you
[16:41] cannot have a soldier who's disobedient
[16:43] to the
[16:45] general amen yes because why the general
[16:50] has a plan the general is has a
[16:54] strategic Warfare the general has a
[16:57] strategic method of how to take over
[16:59] territories yes amen the general also
[17:03] has the most experience in the camp amen
[17:06] he's fought many wars he's had many
[17:09] victories sometimes this might be a
[17:11] soldier's first war but he is not alone
[17:13] he is under a general amen who has had
[17:16] many wars in fact this General has had
[17:18] no defeats amen he's only known Victory
[17:22] amen amen aren't you glad so when you
[17:25] are facing trials now when you are
[17:27] facing battles know that there's a
[17:29] general standing with you that has not
[17:31] known defeat amen amen hallelujah so you
[17:35] cannot be defeated amen but you have to
[17:37] follow the General's
[17:39] orders now sometimes the general might
[17:43] give you orders that you might not like
[17:46] it might not be easy orders sometimes a
[17:48] general might ask the soldier to go
[17:50] beyond Enemy
[17:52] Lines hey man it's not an easy thing in
[17:55] fact sometimes it can feel like a
[17:57] suicide mission to go beyond Enemy Lines
[18:01] but there is a reason for the order amen
[18:04] and if you come under obedience to the
[18:06] general you are sure bound to win the
[18:08] war amen amen there's there's strategic
[18:12] operations coming down amen maybe
[18:15] sometimes there's an operation Amen to
[18:17] tactically go into a specific unit to do
[18:19] a specific rescue amen it sounds like a
[18:23] dangerous thing to that Soldier but he
[18:25] is relying in the in his confidence in
[18:28] the general
[18:29] amen amen I don't know if you've seen
[18:31] soldiers but they have extreme
[18:33] confidence in their
[18:34] leaders in fact they obey their leaders
[18:37] more than they will maybe even the
[18:39] president they General to them is more
[18:42] than the president amen the Commandments
[18:44] that they receive amen they follow it as
[18:48] is you have to have confidence in his
[18:51] orders amen now imagine going to war and
[18:54] you don't have confidence in your
[18:56] general imagine the amount of fear
[18:59] you're going to have going into war but
[19:01] you because you don't have confidence in
[19:03] the one that's leading you amen a
[19:06] typical example is
[19:08] Saul amen he was so fearful there that
[19:12] the Israeli Army could not have
[19:13] confidence in him against
[19:16] Goliath they could not have confidence
[19:18] in him why because he are so fearful but
[19:20] when David come in the camp and he did
[19:22] what he did am man he slayed Goliath
[19:25] then they were able to have confidence
[19:27] and then they were able to go and attack
[19:29] the armies yes amen see so you got to
[19:32] have confidence in who is leading you so
[19:35] that is why in this hour it is so
[19:37] important to know who is leading you
[19:39] amen there should be no Shadow of Doubt
[19:42] in your mind that the angel of the Lord
[19:44] is present amen there should be no
[19:46] Shadow of Doubt amen that the angel of
[19:47] the Lord is leading
[19:49] us because the moment you doubt that
[19:52] you've already lost the wall yeah the
[19:55] moment you the moment you doubt that
[19:56] Satan has got the victory over your life
[19:59] amen
[20:03] amen now as I said on Sunday you've
[20:06] already heard amen Pastor speaking on
[20:09] Amen the Philadelphia Corridor and these
[20:12] goals that the the prime minister of
[20:15] Israel had set amen and we just want to
[20:18] talk about it just a little bit just as
[20:19] a revision amen just to amen affirm
[20:23] those things that have been said and
[20:24] maybe the angel might even the angel of
[20:26] the Lord might bring it in a different
[20:28] light tonight amen
[20:30] amen so we know that when Israel went to
[20:33] war when Joshua for example was leading
[20:35] Israel he was not leading Israel alone
[20:37] the angel of the Lord met him right yes
[20:40] and the angel of the Lord came as the
[20:41] captain of the host yes so Joshua is
[20:44] able to win all of his Wars because the
[20:46] angel of the Lord was with him amen amen
[20:50] now we know that the angel of the Lord
[20:53] also now is still working Amen in
[20:56] natural
[20:57] Israel yes now you might say why is the
[20:59] Angel of the Lord working in natural
[21:01] Israel they are not serving God remember
[21:04] natural Israel might not necessarily be
[21:06] the 144,000 meaning the armies the
[21:09] soldiers and so forth we don't know who
[21:11] the 144,000 is so you might ask okay but
[21:14] then why would the angel lead
[21:17] them amen now we know in the Book of
[21:22] Revelation the Bible tells us that the
[21:24] angel is the one controlling the Ws he's
[21:26] the one that's holding back the Ws and
[21:28] holding the winds and
[21:30] strife so the angel has to be in control
[21:33] of what's going on because if the angel
[21:35] is not in control World War I can SP can
[21:38] spark sooner than it
[21:39] should because the angel is instructed
[21:42] to hold back the Ws and the winds and
[21:43] strife amen amen so he has to be in
[21:46] control of what's happening because
[21:48] World War I cannot happen until the
[21:51] bride leaves the scene yes and until the
[21:54] 144,000 are sealed amen amen so has to
[21:58] be in control of what's happening
[22:01] because if the W was just left to man
[22:03] and man in his own Wicked devices World
[22:06] War I would have already taken place
[22:08] because man is continually
[22:10] evil because they've already got the
[22:13] artillery to spark World War I so what's
[22:16] holding them back is the Angel of the
[22:19] Lord so we know he is in control of what
[22:21] is happening so when you see for example
[22:24] the video of prime minister uh uh netan
[22:28] speaking
[22:29] you should know that if he is
[22:31] giv tactical instruction and goals of
[22:34] what they want to accomplish in a
[22:36] natural War you should know that the
[22:39] angel of the Lord is basically telling
[22:41] us the same thing in the spiritual realm
[22:43] amen he's accomplishing the same thing
[22:46] in our spiritual warfare
[22:48] yes amen amen now we don't have to go
[22:51] into the the digital footprint of the
[22:54] Angel amen amen and and how long the
[22:57] video was you can see by the very
[22:59] contents of it that the angel of the
[23:01] Lord is is directing
[23:04] things
[23:06] amen so if we go over
[23:13] it you know before we go into these
[23:16] goals that he was talking about you know
[23:19] the the other thing that we've been
[23:21] speaking about over the weeks is the
[23:22] image that we've come up to which is the
[23:24] image of Kings and Priests amen now if
[23:27] you notice
[23:29] the image of kings and and Priests both
[23:32] are involved in war yes because the king
[23:35] is the one that leading the war and the
[23:38] levitical order the priesthood is the
[23:40] one that goes
[23:41] first in the war so the image that God
[23:44] is bringing you up into Kings and
[23:46] Priests is an image for
[23:48] war it's an image that's putting you in
[23:52] war
[23:55] amen and now you know when the prophet
[23:57] had the preview of the bride now here he
[23:59] is seen the preview of the Bride but
[24:01] what were they marching to yes Onward
[24:04] Christian
[24:05] Soldiers amen so this bride is marching
[24:08] unto War amen amen it's not a bride that
[24:11] is here Amen to look just pretty amen
[24:14] all in a bride's outfit it's a bride
[24:17] that is prepared for
[24:19] walk it's a bride that is an invincible
[24:23] Army she's a force to be reckoned with
[24:26] amen amen yes H
[24:31] amen now even in our own lives you know
[24:34] we're talking about the bride
[24:36] collectively but even in our own lives
[24:38] we are called to war every day yes you
[24:41] know the very lives we live every day we
[24:43] are facing trials the prophet tells us
[24:46] we have an
[24:47] enemy amen we have amen someone that we
[24:51] is opposing us every day from the time
[24:54] we wake up till the time we go to bed we
[24:56] have an enemy that is opposing us yes
[24:59] amen opposing us through our very own
[25:01] flesh sometimes amen it doesn't just
[25:04] have to be someone else opposing you
[25:06] sometimes he opposes us through our own
[25:07] flesh through our own mind yes and we're
[25:11] going to talk tonight later on about the
[25:13] tactics of the enemy amen because if you
[25:16] are going into war with an enemy you
[25:18] have to know the enemy's tactics amen
[25:21] you can't go into a w
[25:23] blind amen you have to have you know in
[25:27] in why you get secret intelligence that
[25:29] will come and tell you what the enemy is
[25:31] doing they are able to go into Beyond
[25:34] Enemy Lines like Joshua and Caleb for
[25:36] example they're able to spy out what the
[25:38] enemy is doing and they come back with
[25:41] secret intelligence so that now you can
[25:43] prepare for war and and even we read in
[25:46] the in Kings how the King was angry
[25:50] because God was telling Elisha what what
[25:53] what the King was speaking in his
[25:55] bedroom and everything that he was
[25:57] plotting and planning God was telling
[25:59] Elisha and we had a prophet in this day
[26:02] amen that could tell us what the enemy
[26:04] is plotting could expose the enemy's
[26:07] tactics so that now when we as the bread
[26:10] go to war we are not going unprepared
[26:12] amen amen we know exactly what his
[26:14] tactics are
[26:16] amen
[26:18] amen so here the prime minister is is
[26:22] addressing the people and you know he
[26:29] he starts off there by by saying
[26:31] something very
[26:36] interesting can just get
[26:41] that he says I want to talk to you today
[26:45] about some of the things we must do to
[26:47] achieve the goal right and and he says
[26:51] what is it is to extricate evil from our
[26:54] midst now he's emphasizing that this is
[26:57] something we must do yes you see
[27:01] extracting Satan from our lives is
[27:03] something that we must do getting rid of
[27:06] the enemy in our lives in the church in
[27:08] the bride of Christ is something we must
[27:10] do it is not optional amen it's
[27:13] something that we must do amen when the
[27:16] enemy has laid all of these attacks
[27:19] against the bride of Christ against our
[27:21] families against our own
[27:24] lives what we must do is get rid of the
[27:27] enemy yes yes amen we are not called to
[27:29] negotiate with the
[27:31] Enemy amen we are not called to talk
[27:34] peace talks with the Enemy amen this
[27:36] bride is called to destroy the enemy
[27:40] amen not to negotiate because remember
[27:43] the prophet told us don't try and see
[27:45] how close you can get to Satan don't try
[27:47] and see how close you can play around
[27:49] with
[27:50] sin he said because the enemy will take
[27:52] you for a further ride than you
[27:54] anticipated amen but now our job is not
[27:57] to negotiate with him mess around with
[27:58] him but to destroy him yes so he says
[28:01] this is something we must do amen we
[28:04] must get rid of Hamas that's what he
[28:06] says yes amen and then he goes into uh
[28:11] into the goals and stuff but he says how
[28:13] did this thing start off he says it
[28:15] started off when we let go of the
[28:17] borders because they were once in
[28:19] control of the borders right you would
[28:21] have heard this on Sunday I'm sure they
[28:23] were once in control of the borders but
[28:26] they began to let go of these borders
[28:28] after the 2005 disengagement
[28:31] agreements amen so just like that the
[28:34] prophet had laid up the borders because
[28:37] he's given us the full word amen he laid
[28:40] out Church order and Doctrine he laid
[28:42] out all the borders for us amen amen but
[28:45] they come a laxing amen because of the
[28:47] spirit of lateria they come a relaxation
[28:51] because of the spirit of the age and
[28:53] what happened people started to let down
[28:55] the
[28:55] borders amen we started get lukewarm in
[28:59] the message now we're not talking about
[29:00] the church world tonight we're not
[29:02] talking about the denominations they are
[29:04] already a curse system amen he not going
[29:07] to do us any good to talk about them
[29:08] anymore amen we are interested in the
[29:11] bride of Christ we are interested in the
[29:13] message of the hour and you find that
[29:16] the people began to let down the bars
[29:18] amen the things that they once stood for
[29:20] in the early years where they stood
[29:22] strong people began to get relaxed in it
[29:25] and now that leave room for the enemy to
[29:27] come in yes amen now you can think of
[29:32] various examples of where they let down
[29:34] the borders amen all the way down from
[29:36] the individual life amen to the church
[29:39] itself locally amen and to the body of
[29:43] Christ you can think of various examples
[29:45] they let down the bars in Doctrine
[29:46] started to come up with strange
[29:48] teachings started to come up with
[29:49] strange doctrines amen preachers want to
[29:52] make a name for themselves instead of
[29:54] equipping the people amen the preachers
[29:56] want to start to make a name for them
[29:58] the they get some good inspiration they
[30:00] want to think highly about like
[30:02] something good about but meanwhile God
[30:05] is just trying to bring a word to his
[30:06] people but they start to get it up in
[30:09] their
[30:10] head amen and so instead of the people
[30:13] getting equipped amen the man is
[30:17] elevated amen various examples of sin
[30:20] creeping in the church amen you all
[30:23] around the world you begin to see sin
[30:25] creeping in the message of the hour you
[30:27] begin to see people amen letting down
[30:29] the bars amen like the prophet used to
[30:31] sing that song Amen we let down the bars
[30:33] we let down the bars amen and that's how
[30:35] the gods got
[30:37] in and that's how Hamas got in amen and
[30:41] before that they were not able to
[30:43] smuggle in weapons and all of these
[30:45] things amen because Israel was in
[30:47] control of it amen but when they let
[30:51] down the when they let the corridors go
[30:53] now they started to bring in all the
[30:55] weapons bring in all the missiles and
[30:57] bring in all of these things that they
[31:00] were controlled before not to
[31:02] do and now when they brought in these
[31:05] things the very same things now that
[31:08] they settle smuggling is being used to
[31:10] combat
[31:13] Israel amen and we know that when we are
[31:16] allow sat now remember the prophet said
[31:19] that Satan cannot touch you as long as
[31:21] you sealed with the Holy Ghost and the
[31:23] prophet says that the only way that
[31:24] Satan can get to you is if you come out
[31:27] of the the Holy Ghost and you remember
[31:30] the prophet said now you can grieve the
[31:32] Holy Ghost is that right and he said the
[31:34] Holy Ghost is a gentleman and when you
[31:37] grieve him he takes his flight and the
[31:39] prophet said then you got to pray him
[31:40] back amen so so you see so by letting
[31:44] down the bars that's how we let Satan
[31:46] in so long as we were sealed and we
[31:49] remained in the Holy Ghost we remained
[31:51] within our safe corridors the enemy was
[31:54] not able to get
[31:55] in but the prophet says Dre back amen
[31:59] amen don't live without the Holy Ghost
[32:02] amen there should be a continual check
[32:04] amen to see whether we've grieve the
[32:06] Holy Ghost because remember the prophet
[32:08] says as long as we are living in this
[32:10] pierced house amen there's going to be
[32:12] things we do sometimes that we don't
[32:13] want to do like Paul says the thing that
[32:16] I hate I find myself doing and when we
[32:18] do that we grieve the Holy Ghost but we
[32:20] got to pray him back into our lives we
[32:23] got to check constantly is the Holy
[32:25] Ghost in me we got to check constantly
[32:27] have I grieve the Holy Ghost have I said
[32:30] something that has grieved him I have I
[32:32] done something that has grieved him
[32:34] don't live without the Holy Ghost Amen
[32:36] in fact there shouldn't be a day that
[32:38] the Holy Ghost is not Upon Us amen every
[32:41] second every hour amen meditates upon
[32:43] these things amen amen because the Holy
[32:47] Ghost is our protection it's our seal oh
[32:50] amen remember when the seal is upon the
[32:52] car it cannot be touched until it
[32:54] reaches its
[32:56] destination amen
[32:59] so they began to let down these
[33:00] corridors and that's how the the enemy
[33:02] got
[33:03] in
[33:06] amen and so he says the first goal amen
[33:11] when he goes now into the goals he says
[33:12] the first goal is to destroy the enemy
[33:15] yes and to destroy its military power
[33:18] his military might which is Hamas amen
[33:21] right that's I'm pretty sure amen you'll
[33:23] know now what the goals are and we
[33:26] already know amen what's been preached
[33:28] the last few weeks amen we were
[33:30] instructed by the angel of the Lord to
[33:32] utterly kill and destroy amen amen you
[33:37] see we cannot leave leave room for the
[33:39] enemy to
[33:41] remain you know when Israel went into
[33:43] war like under Saul and God instructed
[33:47] him to destroy everything yes yes and
[33:50] Saul would be disobedient and he
[33:51] wouldn't obey God and sometimes he'll
[33:54] keep maybe he'll keep the slaves or the
[33:56] woman or the the the spoils and Riches
[33:59] of the land but God's instruction is to
[34:01] utterly destroy amen amen it's to
[34:05] disintegrate amen you know like the
[34:07] prophet said when you take your sin and
[34:10] you put it like that ink in that uh
[34:12] bottle of ink uh the bleach it utterly
[34:15] disintegrates
[34:17] it amen so they ought to be amen utter
[34:21] destroying of the enemy yes they
[34:23] shouldn't be amen the enemy in our lives
[34:26] amen we shouldn't give room for the
[34:28] enemy in our lives that's what I'm
[34:29] trying to say Amen in fact we've had
[34:32] enough of the enemy we've had enough of
[34:35] him trying Amen to work in our lives
[34:38] we've had enough of him trying to bring
[34:39] sickness Upon Our Lives we had enough of
[34:42] him trying to bring false doctrin into
[34:44] the church amen we've had enough of him
[34:46] trying to rob our
[34:48] inheritance amen because every time the
[34:51] enemy amen wants to bring doubt wants to
[34:53] bring reasoning he is robbing you of
[34:55] your inheritance because if he can get
[34:57] you to live under fear if he can get you
[35:00] to live amen under stress and anxiety
[35:03] Then you can't operate in faith amen and
[35:05] the only way you can access your
[35:07] inheritance is to operate in faith amen
[35:10] amen so if we leave the enemy to
[35:12] continue with these things we are going
[35:14] to be robbed of our inheritance amen
[35:17] amen and you see Israel by leaving these
[35:20] enemies amen it eventually resulted in
[35:23] this massacre of October 7th and the
[35:25] continued was since then yes
[35:28] and they brought it upon themselves by
[35:30] letting down the
[35:32] borders amen so we got to destroy the
[35:35] enemy
[35:37] amen now if you going to amen what's the
[35:40] what's the next goal then the ne the
[35:43] next goal is said was to rescue the
[35:45] hostages that were
[35:47] taken amen the the next goal was to
[35:51] rescue those that were taken on October
[35:54] 7th now the angel is giving Specific
[35:57] Instructions yeah we are called amen not
[35:59] to just sit amen and and to hear the
[36:02] word but we got to go after our brothers
[36:04] and
[36:06] sisters because Abraham when lot amen
[36:09] was taken captive Abraham got to work he
[36:12] began to get all of his servants he
[36:14] began to get into a time of of warfare
[36:16] amen and he went to rescue lot now
[36:20] Abraham could have said amen this lot
[36:23] you know lot hadn't come in amen lot
[36:26] chose to go down to Sodom and he chose
[36:27] to get lukewarm and he chose to uh go
[36:31] that route so he must live with it but
[36:33] no Abraham having a spirit of Christ
[36:35] upon him which is a spirit to save which
[36:38] is a savior spirit amen went to rescue
[36:41] lot amen even in the time when God
[36:44] wanted to destroy Sodom and gomorra
[36:47] Abraham pleaded
[36:49] yes so we are called Amen to rescue the
[36:53] hostages yes now some of us some of us
[36:55] get the wrong attitude sometimes
[36:58] you know when someone begins to
[37:00] backslide or or they fall into sin or
[37:02] maybe they leave the church they leave
[37:03] the message and we begin to talk about
[37:06] them instead of being
[37:08] concerned instead of going to rescue
[37:11] amen we begin to talk about them we say
[37:13] no this person look how he left the
[37:15] message yeah maybe this person was not
[37:18] called we say look how this person fell
[37:20] in sin they claim to be in the message
[37:22] see see how this person fell in sin or
[37:24] look at that Minister his son he's
[37:26] preaching the church but a son or
[37:28] daughter is doing this what is it we are
[37:31] watching the enemy take our own hostages
[37:34] and instead of going after our hostages
[37:37] we are condemning them now it's not them
[37:40] the enemy is taking remember what is
[37:42] Hamas it's a violent Force the enemy is
[37:44] taking them by violent force and now
[37:47] they are riant on the military force of
[37:50] Israel spiritually Israel to rescue them
[37:53] because remember not everyone is called
[37:55] to be in the Army amen there's a special
[37:58] military force that is designed to
[38:00] rescue hostages amen you you'll find
[38:03] that they have these special forces amen
[38:05] like amen the special force in USA they
[38:08] call the Delta Force they were spe
[38:12] specifically designed to go into certain
[38:14] conditions like where they are to go
[38:15] into Pakistan to find Ben Laden amen
[38:19] they are these special forces that are
[38:20] trained to go beyond Enemy Lines to
[38:22] rescue hostages or to kill terrorists
[38:25] amen they're specifically trained for
[38:27] that so when we find now our own is
[38:30] taken by hostage these special forces
[38:34] that is there now to rescue them amen
[38:37] amen you've got intercessor you got
[38:39] someone who is skilled with the word
[38:40] amen that can take the word and maybe
[38:42] bring back bring them back by the word
[38:44] amen you got someone who is amen skilled
[38:46] in interceding you got someone that is
[38:49] skilled at fasting you got all of these
[38:52] different spiritual forces but instead
[38:54] of going to these forces to rescue the
[38:56] hostages we condemn
[38:59] them amen now remember we know all the
[39:02] stories in the Bible Esther amen was
[39:04] preserved for a time of preservation to
[39:06] save
[39:07] life
[39:09] amen and notice when Abra when Abraham
[39:12] went to meet lot uh sorry went to rescue
[39:15] lot he went into
[39:17] Warfare and upon his victory who did he
[39:20] meet he then comes to King and priest am
[39:24] he then comes to the image it's linked
[39:26] to Warfare amen oh yes you see he then
[39:30] after having the victory he meets mezd
[39:34] amen King and priest
[39:36] amen but he had to go into spiritual
[39:39] warfare amen or should I say for him
[39:41] natural Warfare but for our spiritual
[39:44] warfare it's linked to the image it's
[39:47] linked to your
[39:50] adoption amen but you have to rescue the
[39:53] hostages amen we cannot leave now
[39:56] imagine and some of us maybe would have
[39:58] said this as well when uh October 7th
[40:01] when they were taken captive they said
[40:03] look at these Israelites they were at a
[40:05] rave party they deserve it why they were
[40:08] there having partying and being in the
[40:09] world and having a rave party they
[40:11] deserve it now imagine Israel sit back
[40:14] and say no we're not going to rescue
[40:15] them party in the world they in a r
[40:19] party we don't need to rescue them is
[40:20] that the approach that Israel took no no
[40:24] Israel said they are our own amen it was
[40:28] their
[40:29] nationality yes amen and as the bride we
[40:32] have a nationality we have Heavenly
[40:35] origion Hallelujah am we have the same
[40:38] nationality so no matter whether they
[40:40] fell in sin whether they left the church
[40:41] whether they did this whether they did
[40:43] that amen our job the instruction is
[40:46] remember the instruction is coming out
[40:47] from the general of the army rescue the
[40:49] hostages amen amen your family members
[40:52] that maybe are not saved it is your duty
[40:55] to rescue them amen amen did not Paul
[40:57] say by the unbelieving husband the wife
[40:59] will be saved by Sorry by the believing
[41:01] husband the unbelieving wife will be
[41:03] saved and vice versa it is your duty to
[41:07] save them don't leave them to die yes
[41:11] remember you we might condemn them and
[41:13] say oh they're not in the message they
[41:14] don't believe like we believe see how
[41:16] they love see how they dress but what
[41:18] they're taken by a violent
[41:21] Force amen and we are the military to
[41:24] take it back amen amen Hallelujah so
[41:28] amen the instruction from the angel is
[41:30] rescue the hostages amen what was the
[41:32] next
[41:34] goal amen the next goal amen was to
[41:43] sorry amen when he comes to the next
[41:45] goal I'm paraphrasing he says the next
[41:48] goal is to ensure that this never
[41:49] happens again amen they are not going to
[41:52] give Hamas amen this opportunity to do
[41:54] it again now what I find interesting
[41:58] you know or before we get to that amen
[42:01] this is why when when when we have a
[42:05] victory amen or even in Divine Healing
[42:07] when you have healing or when you are
[42:09] delivered of an evil spirit the prophet
[42:12] said now that evil spirit goes around
[42:15] yes and if he comes back and the strong
[42:17] man of the house is not there he comes
[42:20] back with seven worst
[42:21] demons amen so what he saying now is now
[42:24] that we've taken back the corridor we've
[42:26] taken back amen these territories we
[42:30] cannot give it back because if Hamas
[42:32] comes back then and we are not there to
[42:33] control it Hamas is going to get
[42:35] stronger and they're going to do what
[42:37] and remember what Hamas mission is to
[42:40] continue with the massacre they said
[42:42] they are not going to stop with it yes
[42:45] so that is why the prophet teaches us
[42:48] when you are delivered of a spirit you
[42:49] got to make sure the strong man of the
[42:50] house is there you got to make sure you
[42:52] receive the Holy Spirit you got to make
[42:53] sure that you are
[42:55] sealed amen because you got to ensure
[42:58] man that the territory now think now
[43:00] about the territory that we've been
[43:01] taking back in recent services in recent
[43:04] weeks in recent months think about the
[43:06] lands that we have been taken back think
[43:08] about the territory we've been taken
[43:10] back you cannot leave that unguarded now
[43:12] amen it doesn't mean because you took it
[43:14] over that's the end of it amen you got
[43:16] to protect it now you got to protect
[43:18] what you took back because it was yours
[43:20] in the first place it was your
[43:22] inheritance in the first place so you
[43:24] got to guard it now so that the enemy
[43:26] cannot take it again
[43:27] yes oh yes Lord because if you don't
[43:30] he's going to come back with more
[43:32] ammunition he's going to come back with
[43:34] more demon
[43:35] Spirits amen now what is the enemy's
[43:39] military might the prophet says that
[43:42] there's been 200 million demons
[43:44] Unleashed upon the earth now this is the
[43:47] enemy's military
[43:48] might and this is what is Waging War
[43:51] against us every day that is why you got
[43:53] to keep your borders guarded the
[43:55] territory that we have taken back the
[43:57] Holy Ghost Divine Healing and all of
[44:00] these things now you know Pastor made
[44:02] mention of Rafa and I had this in my
[44:04] notes it's very interesting
[44:07] because they say that all along when
[44:10] they were trying to make deals with
[44:12] Hamas Hamas didn't want to release
[44:15] hostages yes but the moment they took
[44:18] Rafa
[44:19] yes he said they felt the pressure and
[44:23] they began to release
[44:25] hostages amen and the moment we
[44:27] connected with the angel of the Lord the
[44:28] first thing we took back was Divine
[44:30] Healing amen amen the first thing we
[44:33] took back if you remember last year what
[44:35] was the first thing we took back last
[44:37] year was Divine
[44:38] Healing we said far too long the church
[44:41] has gone on without Divine Healing in
[44:44] fact The Message Church began to get so
[44:46] lukewarm the enemy had them so wrapped
[44:48] up that they began to think Divine
[44:50] Healing is not does not even apply to
[44:53] us amen they began to say you know they
[44:56] can wrap it up very nicely he began to
[44:59] say no Divine Healing was for the you
[45:02] know the prophet's day he had the first
[45:03] pull he had this gift you know they can
[45:06] wrap it up very nicely yes but remember
[45:09] if there's no Divine Healing there is no
[45:12] Resurrection if there's no Divine
[45:14] Healing there's no
[45:16] Rapture because you can't have faith for
[45:18] a Rapture if there's no faith for Divine
[45:20] Healing yes now that is not
[45:24] conditional yes
[45:27] that is a guarantee if you do not have
[45:29] faith for Divine Healing you will not
[45:30] have faith for a Rapture you will not
[45:32] have faith for a body change because
[45:34] Divine Healing is the earnest of the
[45:36] body
[45:37] change so if you are saying Divine
[45:40] Healing was only for the prophet what
[45:42] you are saying is that the Rapture is
[45:43] only for the prophet what you are saying
[45:46] is that the body change is only for the
[45:48] prophet and yes he will rise he will
[45:50] have a body change but what about you
[45:53] yes amen you've got to have faith for it
[45:56] right So Divine Healing was the first
[45:58] thing we took that is why Divine Healing
[45:59] is so important it's because it's the
[46:02] earnest of the body
[46:04] change and that is the first territory
[46:06] we took
[46:07] back and I want you to
[46:10] notice that the moment we took back that
[46:14] territory the enemy now in the Demon
[46:17] World started to feel the pressure yes
[46:20] yes amen amen started to feel the
[46:23] attacks amen started to feel our
[46:26] military might
[46:28] because now the bride now started to get
[46:30] a confidence about herself amen the
[46:33] bride was no longer scared yes Lord the
[46:35] bride was no longer an invisible Army
[46:37] she was now an invincible army yes amen
[46:41] the bride started to take back territory
[46:43] and the enemy began to say what is
[46:45] happening here now we thought we had
[46:48] them yes amen we thought we took that
[46:52] territory of Divine Healing what is
[46:55] happening we thought we had them convert
[46:57] that Divine Healing was only for the
[46:59] prophet we thought we had them convinced
[47:01] that Divine Healing is only a minor so
[47:03] we don't have to Major on a
[47:07] minina amen but the bride began to take
[47:10] it back oh yes now notice he said how do
[47:14] they take over Rafa he said they took
[47:17] over Rafa with air strikes and which
[47:20] animal kills it pray from the air air
[47:23] strikes amen the eagle amen it's an
[47:26] eagle
[47:28] amen so eag anointing come down in this
[47:30] age am Amen to take that raer
[47:34] withes amen what is the eagle anointing
[47:36] amen which is the anointing to see the
[47:38] anointing to understand the anointing to
[47:41] perceive what the word of God is saying
[47:43] that these promises are for us amen is
[47:46] the eagle anointing with air strikes
[47:48] amen that could take over Rafa
[47:50] Hallelujah and notice when they now when
[47:53] they take over
[47:55] Rafa the in fact let's read this article
[47:58] because I find this article very
[48:02] interesting this is another this is
[48:05] another
[48:19] article so on 6 May
[48:22] 2024 Israel began a military offensive
[48:26] in and around the city of Rafa as part
[48:30] as part Israel initially planned to
[48:32] launch a two division sweep across the
[48:34] se you have to have the Dynamics and the
[48:36] mechanics Amen to operate Divine leing
[48:39] you can't only have one because it's a
[48:40] supernatural happening amen so you have
[48:42] to have the Dynamics and the mechanics
[48:45] but notice this now but this is what
[48:48] Israel wanted to do but US President Joe
[48:51] Biden considered a major attack into
[48:54] Rafa a red line
[48:56] now we know who America is typing and
[48:59] who does America speak on behalf of Amen
[49:02] we know the Beast amen who he's speaking
[49:05] on behalf of Amen it's the system amen
[49:08] of the Antichrist system amen the Beast
[49:11] amen and he now says Israel must not do
[49:15] this because a major attack on Rafa is a
[49:17] red line that cannot be crossed so this
[49:20] system now hey man this beast and this
[49:23] dragon is saying no you cannot get get
[49:25] Divine Healing back
[49:27] it say no you can have every other thing
[49:29] you can have you know you have all these
[49:31] teachings you have the word you have the
[49:32] Mysteries and all of these things but
[49:34] you cannot get the supernatural back
[49:36] it's a red line you cannot
[49:39] cross that is what they are
[49:41] saying and now look they forced Israel
[49:45] to reduce the operation to capturing the
[49:48] border to seal off arms smuggling into
[49:50] Gaza and and rely on targeted raids into
[49:55] Rafa so pressure come from the system
[49:58] now
[49:58] remember how does Rome control the world
[50:01] it's not just the pope coming and saying
[50:02] do this do that they control it through
[50:05] the system of the whole world it's in
[50:07] politics it's in the job world it's in
[50:09] education it's in Hollywood it's
[50:11] everywhere that's how they control
[50:13] everything right so they began to put
[50:16] the pressure so that our spiritual
[50:18] Israel is not forced to take a backseat
[50:20] now they don't want to engage with the
[50:23] supernatural they don't want to engage
[50:25] in Divine Healing
[50:27] but look Israel now sends because the
[50:29] whole of Israel can't do it they can't
[50:31] go with such a big attack they send
[50:33] targeted raids into Rafa amen targeted
[50:36] forces because certain groups of people
[50:38] began to realize who they are certain
[50:41] groups of people began to realize that
[50:43] the Supernatural is for us certain
[50:45] groups of people begin to realize amen
[50:47] that there's another Unseen World with
[50:49] us and that there's a connection to the
[50:51] Unseen World so that we can do a
[50:53] targeted raid to Rafa amen amen amen so
[50:56] so they began never mind the rest the
[50:59] rest of the church world might not get
[51:01] into the supernatural as yet never mind
[51:03] the rest of the messy churches might not
[51:05] get into the supernatural as yet but a
[51:07] spiritual targeted raid has happened
[51:10] amen and that cannot open the door for
[51:12] the rest to come
[51:14] in
[51:21] amen now this is the time when you know
[51:24] our Heathen Nation so that Africa and
[51:27] this was the time when they started to
[51:28] take Israel out to the international
[51:30] court of justice and and and things like
[51:32] that and we know that whoever blesses
[51:34] Israel is blessed whoever curses Israel
[51:36] is is cursed so our country is cursed
[51:40] amen that is why you know we if you're
[51:44] trying to to succeed in the natural in
[51:47] the economy of South Africa now if you
[51:50] relying on your own strength if you
[51:52] relying on your own merits your
[51:54] qualifications your degree
[51:57] and your job and all of these things
[51:58] you're going to utterly fail because now
[52:00] South Africa is cursed the economy is
[52:02] cursed everything is cursed the only way
[52:04] you can succeed is by Gyra by relying on
[52:09] Gyra not relying on South African
[52:11] economy because they are cursed yes
[52:15] amen amen but there's something there's
[52:19] something I want to see about sou South
[52:21] Africa when I come to a court uh later
[52:23] on about what they did here
[52:34] amen so those were the goals now that
[52:36] that the Prime Minister amen said that
[52:38] this is what they want to achieve now in
[52:42] in in the spiritual and I don't want to
[52:44] be too much longer I just want to go
[52:46] through some quotes amen just to to show
[52:48] you amen the enemy's tactics amen so
[52:50] that we are prepared for it but just to
[52:52] say in the spiritual there has to be
[52:55] goals that we need to achieve in this
[52:58] war in this fight there has to be things
[53:00] that we have to achieve we're not living
[53:01] here aimlessly amen God is not the
[53:04] author of confusion he doesn't do things
[53:07] haphazardly and there's a reason why he
[53:09] sent the captain of the
[53:11] host amen there's specific things he
[53:14] wants to achieve so we got to be aligned
[53:17] with these goals we got to come into
[53:19] connection with the angel so we are
[53:20] aligned with what God wants to achieve
[53:22] amen now if you're only going to be
[53:23] focused on achieving your own goals
[53:26] achieving what you want to achieve in
[53:27] this life then you're not going to be
[53:29] aligned with his
[53:31] goals amen and if you're not going to be
[53:33] aligned in his goals how are you going
[53:35] to benefit from when he takes back
[53:38] territories you're trying to achieve
[53:40] things in this natural life he is
[53:41] showing you now hey I'm taking you to
[53:44] achieve territories where you can speak
[53:46] things territories where you control
[53:48] things territories where you don't have
[53:50] to go and now you want to do things in
[53:52] the flesh and try and obtain things in
[53:53] the natural he's showing you spiritual
[53:55] laws like Jesus said take no thought for
[53:58] what you would eat or or wear tomorrow
[54:00] these are spiritual laws that he's
[54:02] bringing to you to say don't focus on
[54:04] those things focus on my goals the
[54:07] kingdom focus on what I want to achieve
[54:10] because when you do that then you have
[54:12] access to all of these
[54:14] things when you focus on the kingdom
[54:17] goals you start to have access to
[54:19] everything you have need
[54:21] of because the prophet says every
[54:23] Redemptive blessing was paid for amen
[54:27] now just to go very quickly on what are
[54:31] the enemy's tactics amen we are fighting
[54:35] we said 200 million demons but there
[54:37] tactics that he works by and remember we
[54:39] said how we had a prophet in this day
[54:41] who could expose the tactics yes and the
[54:44] prophet now started to preach
[54:46] demonology and started to show us how
[54:48] the enemy Works he started to show us
[54:51] how the how the enemy Works firstly In
[54:53] the Flesh realm amen through sickness
[54:57] amen and how he can bring sicknesses and
[54:59] he shows us now how sicknesses start to
[55:01] start amen how a demon Spirit man is's
[55:04] just waiting there for some kind of
[55:06] opening in your body to try and
[55:09] pervert he's showing us the tactics of
[55:11] the enemy yes amen then for example a
[55:14] cancer he says can start off from just a
[55:16] bruise the enemy he says there's white
[55:19] soldiers they're trying to heal that
[55:21] that portion of your body that was cut
[55:23] but then the demon Spirit tries to
[55:24] infiltrate that
[55:27] and then he starts to multiply cell upon
[55:29] cell these are his tactics of how he
[55:32] gets us in the
[55:34] flesh and the prophet is exposing this
[55:36] amen because then if we know how he
[55:38] operates we know how to combat him
[55:41] because then we know if the if he if
[55:43] sickness is a spirit we know that okay
[55:46] then that's the easy solution Jesus said
[55:48] we have the authority to cast out
[55:50] Spirits yes amen if that's the tactic
[55:53] the enemy wants to work by then we have
[55:55] a tactic of how to go on the offensive
[55:58] amen we don't have to live with that
[56:00] sickness we can bind that sickness we
[56:02] can cast out that evil spirit yes see
[56:06] these are the tactics of the enemy now
[56:08] we got to know how to combat that yes
[56:11] and then he says the enemy now can also
[56:13] work in the in in your spirit in your
[56:15] mind and he starts to bring doubt and
[56:18] reasoning or he starts to bring
[56:20] complexes upon you amen you start to
[56:23] feel all these complexes like everything
[56:26] is against you the world is against you
[56:28] your parents are against you everyone's
[56:30] against you he starts to make you doubt
[56:33] yourself amen the moment you do
[56:35] something wrong he's there to pounce at
[56:36] you and say see you said you're a
[56:38] Believer but you did this what it's the
[56:41] enemy's
[56:43] tactics and the prophet now is showing
[56:46] us how to combat that and remember our
[56:50] our strongest weapon is this amen cuz
[56:54] when the enemy comes and tells us no you
[56:56] see how you sinning see how you fell
[56:58] you're not a child of God but you can
[56:59] say but there's no condemnation Amen to
[57:02] them who are in Christ Jesus amen he
[57:05] that is born of God cannot commit
[57:07] sin you are only lying amen amen but
[57:11] that's how the enemy Works amen maybe
[57:14] you went to some kind of a hard
[57:16] relationship maybe it's a boyfriend and
[57:18] a girlfriend and you broke up and had a
[57:21] a big heartbreak now the enemy wants to
[57:24] use that wants to use that to open up
[57:27] that soul in your
[57:28] heart amen and many times you think oh
[57:32] you know it was just a natural
[57:34] relationship and you know it never work
[57:36] out and you think in in lines of
[57:38] Hollywood but no it's something that the
[57:41] enemy use to bring hurt in your heart
[57:44] amen it is something that because these
[57:46] are his tactics it is something that the
[57:48] enemy is using to break your heart
[57:51] because once you break your heart amen
[57:53] there's no faith there now because
[57:54] you're depressed you start now watch how
[57:58] the moment they go to these youngsters
[58:00] go to break up now they start to get
[58:01] suicidal thoughts they started to get
[58:04] all these thoughts they're not good
[58:05] enough they feel they're not good enough
[58:07] because they were rejected they feel
[58:09] that maybe um they are inferior all of
[58:12] these thoughts now start to build up
[58:14] because the enemy is playing now using
[58:17] this as a tactic because if he can get
[58:19] you to doubt yourself from the natural
[58:21] then how do you progress in the
[58:25] spiritual he's playing with your
[58:27] reasoning he's playing with your mind
[58:28] he's playing with your spirit but these
[58:29] are tactics of the enemy amen so don't
[58:32] be deceived by the tactics of the enemy
[58:34] cuz Jesus said he is the one that heals
[58:36] the Brokenhearted amen amen so don't be
[58:39] deceived by tactics you know that's what
[58:43] he uses you know the prophet said for
[58:44] example an ungodly woman is a tool in
[58:47] the hands of the enemy in fact he said
[58:49] she is designed by him for that purpose
[58:52] is to tear you
[58:55] down you see these are the tactics that
[58:57] the enemy
[58:59] uses then to go on further into
[59:01] demonology the prophet then says now the
[59:03] enemy also works in the religious realm
[59:06] amen and we know how amen sorry I just
[59:09] need to put my password here you know
[59:11] how the enemy works in the religious
[59:13] realm and leaving aside the
[59:15] denominational world the enemy started
[59:17] to creeping into the message realm
[59:18] started to bring all these false
[59:19] teachings false
[59:22] doctrines and making you believe all
[59:24] these amen things that the prophet never
[59:27] said right he this is his tactics of how
[59:30] he's working in
[59:32] demonology and amen let's let's just go
[59:35] through a few quotes amen so we amen can
[59:37] see what the prophet says about it
[59:39] amen the prophet says and demons are
[59:42] tormentors that torment
[59:44] us now there is demons that comes into
[59:47] the soul of man and and that is in the
[59:50] phraseology that would be the demon that
[59:54] comes into the soul is something that t
[59:56] tments the
[59:57] soul and the prophet says now all
[59:59] sickness we find first that all sickness
[1:00:01] comes from the devil God is not the
[1:00:04] author of sickness amen so get out of
[1:00:06] your mind amen that God Amen God allow
[1:00:10] yes God allows it but God never bring it
[1:00:12] upon you that's what I'm trying to say
[1:00:14] no sickness comes from God God sometimes
[1:00:17] permits Satan to put sickness on you as
[1:00:19] a whooped to bring you back so this is
[1:00:21] the only time that God permits sickness
[1:00:23] upon you is when you went away remember
[1:00:25] we said Satan can only get you if you
[1:00:27] leave the Holy Ghost so because of that
[1:00:29] God puts him upon you as a who to bring
[1:00:31] you back into the house of the
[1:00:33] Lord amen but any other time if you are
[1:00:36] serving God
[1:00:38] Faithfully then that is not God allowing
[1:00:41] sickness upon you that is the enemy
[1:00:42] attacking
[1:00:44] you amen it comes from the
[1:00:47] devil God permits death because of
[1:00:50] disobedient God permits death as one
[1:00:53] writer said all that death can do God
[1:00:56] harnessed into a buggy and pulls us into
[1:00:58] the presence of God a Believer so God as
[1:01:01] well never bring death he permits it but
[1:01:04] he never bring death yes and that is why
[1:01:07] he saying God because he never bring
[1:01:10] death and because he permits it he
[1:01:12] harnessed the power of death to bring
[1:01:13] you into his presence as a open
[1:01:18] door now the prophet says well that's
[1:01:20] the same thing takes place when a demon
[1:01:22] is cast out of a sick person the first
[1:01:25] few days now we know this how the
[1:01:27] prophet say you start to feel good amen
[1:01:30] you start to feel like you well you are
[1:01:32] healed you start to feel all those
[1:01:34] things but after a few days you start to
[1:01:35] feel worse and the prophet is explaining
[1:01:38] to us that that is the time we got to
[1:01:39] believe the most amen because in fact
[1:01:42] that is proof that you've been healed
[1:01:44] when you start to feel worse because the
[1:01:46] spirit has left that body the demon
[1:01:48] Spirit has left that body and whatever
[1:01:50] is in there needs to die
[1:01:54] out but in the moment you doubt there
[1:01:57] that's when the demon comes back and the
[1:01:59] prophet said he comes back with worse
[1:02:00] Spirits yes yes right and now when we
[1:02:03] talking about this don't only think
[1:02:05] about your normal sicknesses think amen
[1:02:08] God has healed us from spiritual
[1:02:11] Amnesia God has healed the body of
[1:02:14] Christ God has healed us from all of
[1:02:17] these things of doubting the word and
[1:02:19] doubting amen who we are and God has
[1:02:22] healed us of all of that but the moment
[1:02:25] you give room for Satan he's going to
[1:02:27] come back with more doubt more
[1:02:30] reasoning
[1:02:32] amen now this is what I wanted to get to
[1:02:35] about South
[1:02:37] Africa remember I said that South Africa
[1:02:41] very strangely was the one to go and
[1:02:44] take Israel to
[1:02:47] court
[1:02:50] sorry so South Africa very strangely was
[1:02:53] the one to go and take Israel to a court
[1:02:56] right and now let's see why South Africa
[1:02:58] did
[1:02:59] that amen for those of you who think it
[1:03:02] was just a natural happening or just a
[1:03:04] coincidental thing it's
[1:03:07] not amen the prophet is is saying here
[1:03:11] is he he in the prayer line right and he
[1:03:14] says how do you do sister our Master is
[1:03:17] Lovely isn't he now I do not know at
[1:03:21] this time what's wrong with you but
[1:03:22] you're a Believer and there's something
[1:03:24] out in the audience pulling the same way
[1:03:27] now it's a kindred spirit so the prophet
[1:03:30] is praying over the sister but there's a
[1:03:33] kindred spirit in the audience that's
[1:03:35] pulling the prophecy is pulling
[1:03:38] him and he says it's something moving
[1:03:42] the same thing that you have see spirits
[1:03:44] are
[1:03:46] Kindred just like you've heard birds of
[1:03:48] a feather you know the same flock
[1:03:50] together see they go together and Demon
[1:03:53] power demonology is works the same
[1:03:56] manner and you standing here you my
[1:03:59] sister you suffering and we
[1:04:02] strangers it's someone sitting right in
[1:04:05] there with the same thing you have and
[1:04:07] it's bothering me now Prophet saying
[1:04:08] it's bothering
[1:04:10] me in other words it's distracting the
[1:04:13] prophet yes and the prophet asked the
[1:04:16] sister and said would you turn this way
[1:04:18] just a moment you look to me I want to
[1:04:21] talk to you just a moment kind of get my
[1:04:24] back to the case so the the prophet
[1:04:26] turns his back to this other case
[1:04:28] because it's distracting
[1:04:30] him and and he says I want to talk to
[1:04:32] you a moment it bothers me I can't see
[1:04:36] what it is and it's pulling it's a
[1:04:37] kindred here here's what it is you are
[1:04:40] human and I am human and each one of us
[1:04:43] are are possessed with a spirit and now
[1:04:45] they in here come to me for Faith and
[1:04:49] you are suffering and in you is a spirit
[1:04:51] of sickness or something or whatever it
[1:04:53] is if I can get you to believe it's got
[1:04:56] to leave you and that's the reason it
[1:04:59] fights so that's what makes it such a
[1:05:01] pull it's got a kindred spirit out they
[1:05:03] pulling the same way for help the demon
[1:05:07] Spirit knows it's in
[1:05:08] trouble because you've already healed so
[1:05:12] the prophet is talking about this
[1:05:13] kindred spirit now why do I bring this
[1:05:15] is
[1:05:17] because here is natural Israel now
[1:05:19] fighting a spiritual war I'm sorry
[1:05:21] fighting a natural War right and
[1:05:24] spiritually Israel here South Africa is
[1:05:26] fighting a war and these demon Spirits
[1:05:29] now a kindred spirit amen cannot take it
[1:05:32] so much so that they not they want to go
[1:05:34] and fight with Israel and take Israel
[1:05:36] Accord why they have no business to do
[1:05:38] it but it's a kindred spirit calling for
[1:05:40] help because they spiritual warfare in
[1:05:42] the front of South Africa that's
[1:05:44] happening and they cannot take it in
[1:05:47] these demon powers cannot take it in the
[1:05:48] spiritual realm so they are they have to
[1:05:51] go all the way now to fight natural
[1:05:53] Israel in the court
[1:05:56] what other reason do they have there's
[1:05:57] no other
[1:05:59] reason but it's because the Demon World
[1:06:01] is feeling such pressure and remember
[1:06:03] the prophet said that each each
[1:06:06] government each King was controlled by
[1:06:08] Spirits amen now if we are fighting a
[1:06:11] Warfare yeah who is the leader of the
[1:06:13] land is the government right besides the
[1:06:15] president because president changes but
[1:06:17] it's the government right it's that that
[1:06:21] offers so if that Spirit cannot take the
[1:06:24] spiritual violence that's happen to them
[1:06:26] in their own land they are now calling
[1:06:28] out for help and now wanting to fight
[1:06:30] this in natural
[1:06:31] Israel and that is what the prophet is
[1:06:33] saying they are kindred spirits and this
[1:06:36] is why South Africa did
[1:06:39] this so you see that is why you got to
[1:06:43] understand who we are in this hour and
[1:06:45] what we are what we are doing we are not
[1:06:47] just here playing church we are winning
[1:06:50] spiritual victories we are taking back
[1:06:53] spiritual territories we are coning amen
[1:06:56] don't just think of this as a small now
[1:06:58] I'm not trying to say that we are the
[1:07:01] only Pebble amongst the bunch I'm not
[1:07:04] trying to say that we are unique and God
[1:07:06] is only moving in us what I'm trying to
[1:07:08] say is I cannot talk for other
[1:07:10] assemblies I can only talk for what God
[1:07:12] is doing here I am present here I know
[1:07:14] what God is doing here so I can talk for
[1:07:17] what God is doing here but what I can
[1:07:19] say is that after months of what God was
[1:07:22] saying here only after months it started
[1:07:24] to go around the world because remember
[1:07:27] everyone Services is recorded so you
[1:07:30] know what's happening
[1:07:31] around amen
[1:07:34] but what I'm trying to say is don't take
[1:07:37] for granted what God is doing here
[1:07:38] because we are a small group of
[1:07:41] people amen the angel of the Lord is
[1:07:43] here instructing us every week and we
[1:07:45] are taking back territory every week we
[1:07:48] are taking back victories every week
[1:07:50] amen and if I can just get to this quot
[1:07:52] amen the enemy is making me really
[1:07:54] struggle with this laptop
[1:07:56] cuz I don't have my MacBook here
[1:08:05] today you know I I find these quotes
[1:08:08] very interesting you know the the
[1:08:10] prophet sometimes he says
[1:08:16] things now watch this right now as I
[1:08:19] said I'm not saying that there's
[1:08:20] anything unique about us well there is
[1:08:23] something unique about the whole bride
[1:08:24] but I'm not saying God is only moving
[1:08:26] amongst us I'm just talking about what
[1:08:28] God is doing
[1:08:30] here amen the prophet is saying then
[1:08:34] after a while I saw a vision when I was
[1:08:37] in America and it came to me and I
[1:08:39] returned me back to Africa it returned
[1:08:41] me back to Africa and it showed me the
[1:08:44] same meeting sitting there in front of
[1:08:46] Durban and the first meeting faded away
[1:08:48] into history talking about when he came
[1:08:50] the first
[1:08:51] time going towards the West the second
[1:08:55] meeting rose up and when it did it was
[1:08:57] still larger than the first meeting the
[1:08:59] first meeting and I heard a scream now
[1:09:02] this is not just a normal vision you can
[1:09:04] see that something very unique is
[1:09:06] happening here he says I heard a scream
[1:09:08] and an angel was coming out of Heaven
[1:09:11] talking about Durban
[1:09:12] now he had a great
[1:09:15] light and the angel of the Lord which
[1:09:17] stands by us here always stands by my
[1:09:20] right over on this side it was standing
[1:09:23] there where in Durban
[1:09:27] it was Ming around and I seen this man
[1:09:30] standing under him he's now the prophet
[1:09:33] says it's not a vision it's just as real
[1:09:35] as you are talking to
[1:09:39] me the man is just standing there just
[1:09:42] the same as you are and his voice amen
[1:09:45] as you would hear mine but a vision
[1:09:48] something that breaks before you the
[1:09:50] prophet just explains a vision now look
[1:09:52] in verse very strikingly in verse 23
[1:09:55] sorry in chapter uh paragraph
[1:09:57] 23 he says so he told me what was going
[1:10:01] to take place and he said that the angel
[1:10:04] came down and he told me to turn and
[1:10:07] look this way and I look towards India
[1:10:11] now I don't say it in India but it's
[1:10:14] near they were the Indian
[1:10:18] people in paragraph 23 the angel is
[1:10:21] saying look this way to Durban the
[1:10:24] Indian people now many people many
[1:10:27] Skeptics use this quote to say the
[1:10:29] prophet was a false prophet because yeah
[1:10:31] he talks about the meeting of 300,000
[1:10:33] people and they use this as a the
[1:10:36] Skeptics use this to say no it never
[1:10:38] happened there was no meeting with
[1:10:39] 300,000 people now what am I trying to
[1:10:41] say I'm not I'm not trying to say that
[1:10:43] this is the Fulfillment of that court
[1:10:45] I'm not yet to make excuses for the
[1:10:47] prophet or to try and defend the prophet
[1:10:49] because God backs up his own word god
[1:10:51] vindicates his word by making it come to
[1:10:53] pass but what I'm trying to see I'm
[1:10:55] showing you a
[1:10:57] type in paragraph 23 is the Angel is
[1:11:00] telling him turn to Duran to the Indian
[1:11:02] people and in the year 2023 the angel of
[1:11:05] the Lord met with us
[1:11:07] amen and notice he's saying this in
[1:11:11] demonology in the spiritual realm where
[1:11:14] I told you he's talking about spiritual
[1:11:16] warfare in the spiritual
[1:11:19] realm amen so are we here in Durban
[1:11:22] fighting a spiritual warfare against the
[1:11:25] spiritual real and taking back victories
[1:11:28] amen under the angel of the
[1:11:31] Lord amen now I'm not going to make a
[1:11:33] doctrine of that you can think what you
[1:11:35] want to of it I'm just reading a
[1:11:38] quote amen so just a last quote Amen in
[1:11:42] closing amen
[1:11:46] so we in Warfare and God's Heroes has
[1:11:50] always had Warfare and you little church
