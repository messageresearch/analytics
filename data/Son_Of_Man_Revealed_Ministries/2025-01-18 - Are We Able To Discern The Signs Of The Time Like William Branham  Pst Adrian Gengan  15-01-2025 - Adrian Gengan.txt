he found us worthy to reveal himself to us amen so welcome back to our Wednesday night meetings amen we were off for 4 weeks brother jaff praise the Lord amen so it's good to be back with Believers of light precious Faith amen and we're going to get into some uh serious stuff amen praise the Lord amen even as we see the day fast approaching we can speak on the word of God Amen let's turn to our Bible Matthew chapter 24 we'll read from verse three and as they sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world Amen now Jesus would go on to talk about all the signs amen but 202 24:24 says for there shall arise false Christ false prophets F and shall show great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect amen so that that's one of the signs amen and then we'll find in verse 30 he says there shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven now we know Jesus Christ is not coming a son of man again he's coming as son of David so what is the sign of the son of man amen so he's saying but where shall it appear where shall it appear it shall appear in the heavens 1963 the sign appears in the heavens amen praise the Lord and then there shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great glory amen praise the Lord verse 36 says but of that day and that hour knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be amen hallelujah then then he goes to tell you how amen two will be grinding in the field amen he'll come and take one and leave one amen so the Lord keeps on going on into Matthew 25 the Lord are blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen for amen just want to go through a few of the prophets amen messages and what we are looking at is we don't want to become desensitized and things are happening all around us and because we are so focused on the natural side of life that we miss the signs of his coming we miss the signs amen because they ask Jesus for the signs and Jesus detail to them if you go and read the whole of Matthew 24 and 25 Jesus is detailing amen what would be the conditions of the earth amen now I want to start by reading what a prophet is many times people are confused at what a prophet is and even amongst the message folks you'll hear them saying a prophet is a modern day preacher but I want the prophet's definition of what a prophet is because we are all modern day preacher preachers but we are not prophets amen you'll find they read the quote halfway that a modern day preacher is a prophet but let's see what the prophet of God is saying amen he says now we might speak here just for a minute what is a prophet now in the English term according to the English terms it means preacher that's the English terms but in the Hebrew terms it's called SE amen I want us to be very clear because I want us to realize what kind of ministry we are associated with amen and isia was one that who had the interpretation of the written word and he forsaw things that was to come and when he spoke of the things that was to come and proved he was a sea then he knowed they know he had the right interpretation of the scripture because God through him manifested the written scripture for that day amen don't be slothful wake up amen so he he's is uh trying to tell us this definition of a prophet is so serious we mustn't be slaughtered we must wake up and listen to what he is saying because you get many people call themselves prophets amen don't be slothful wake up that was the plain identification a SE a for teller or teller forth and the only way way that they know he was getting the right interpretation to the scripture because what he said come to pass amen then they know he was called of God God said that and they noticed that it did it did come right back in continuity with the word for that day amen so we find our Prophet said many things and if he is a true Prophet they must it must come to pass and we know without a shadow of a doubt it's been revealed to us that he is a true Prophet he's a scriptural Prophet amen he's a Vindicated Prophet amen praise the Lord so the things that he spoke we want to look for it amen and also because we are a prophetic class of people be able to see how he saw things so that we can be able to discern it the same way amen because the Bride is a prophetic voice on the earth now the prophet of God will tell us here I want to show you that God can use signs in the heavens and when we see signs in the heavens we should not take it as a natural phenomenon yes right amen hallelujah he says the wise men that came from Babylon they were studying the Stars they were astronomers they studied the Stars they seen these three stars line up now the three stars lining up had a meaning ham sham and Jeff star that they were born under lined up and they knew these scientific Believers watched the Heavenly beings how they moved and when they seen those stars coming to line over Jerusalem for for if there was at Babylon they look right straight towards Jerusalem towards the West to see it and when they seen that com in they knew when those stars come in line with one another now this is the definition of stars coming in line the Messiah was on the earth amen so the lining up of stars and the lining up of planets have meaning but if we are so caught up in the Natural Things of life we will just take it as Natural Things amen but the ones that are studying it a prophet of God would amen tell you that these things means something is happening on the earth God first shows it in the heavens Hallelujah and when we see Israel now watch he's not only showing you the Stars he's showing you a scriptural sign as well Israel going home the Holy Ghost poured out in the churches the economical move of going together the Council of churches and things the Roman Catholics Protestants uniting together that's another sign he says the Messiah is going to come to catch away his bride now for many years the prophet had laid it out how the pope was going to unite all religions through the years we have watched it unfold we even had the chance to preach it as prophecy but it can no longer be preached as prophecy because it has already been fulfilled yes the final document of world religions has already been signed 3 years ago yes that's why you find the pope no longer going around and meeting with all religious leader that has already been done they've already signed amen you watch now the pope is accepting all religions all kinds of worship amen so watch what the prophet is saying now the stars in the heavens lining up Messiah is on Earth Israel going to the Homeland Church receiving the Holy Ghost amen the Catholics Protestants and all religions you in together it's a sign that the Messiah is going to come and catch his way way his bride and he says and God is sending gifts to create a in us a faith that will move us out of here yes am amen someday into a Rapture and what are these gifts Healing The Sick opening the eyes of the blind raising up the dead because the gospel come can't be preached without manifestation yes amen as much as we are preaching the revelation of the word of God there has got to be a manifestation to follow the word of God because Dynamics and mechanics go together praise the Lord and now notice now we are talking when what we are talking about we want to see evidence if we are saying we have the revelation of the word the signs the Wonders the miracles must accompany the ministry and have we seen that accompany the ministry have you seen healings miracles signs and wonders amen hallelujah amen hallelujah Great Signs in the heavens above now watch he's going to continue now he's showing you more evidence Great Signs in the heavens above Angels coming in a constellation and scientists looking off at it predicted months before it happened there it was there it is in Life Magazine told months before before it happened seven angels come down the complete revelation of the six sealed mystery of God would be unfolded and there it was just exactly like he said predicted before it happened now many of us when we look at this picture by now we have digested it and it has become common but this is one of the greatest signs am Hallelujah not only is it a sign it is the start of the returning of the coming of the Lord because he shall descend with a shout yes so this started the Rapture cycle this started the second coming of the Lord amen he shall descend with a shout amen next will come the voice of the Archangel to call out the sleeping Saints amen so this is no ordinary event neither should we look upon this picture as an ordinary Picture This should excite us every time we look at it because he said the prophet says that's our Lord up there amen amen amen so let's not become desensitized to what has been happening within the framework of the message of the hour let's start to place Great Value upon things that have been revealed to us yes amen hallelujah praise the Lord he says and they look around they find all kind of Mystic signs and call them supernatural beings of some kind now you would know about 2 or 3 months ago for the first time they held a hearing in the US about UFOs unidentified flying objects and they were stating specific incidents where fighter pilots had seen these these great big amen things go past them faster than their planes faster than the speed of light they couldn't explain it and it's the first time they've had a public hearing about it you can find it on YouTube you can listen to it the experiences he says they are seeing some kind of Mystic sites call them supernatural beings they call it flying sources fearful signs in the skies on Earth signs the signs point what are these signs now he's telling us what are these signs he says the signs pointing us that the coming of the Lord Jesus is at hand amen Hallelujah he says watch Israel is a nation of her own he going back to another side she's got her own Nation her own flag six point star of David oldest flag in the world flies again for the first time about 2500 years they got their own Army own currency amen represented in the United Nations amen first time for 2500 years Hallelujah so when the prophet of God is teaching us to look at signs he's teaching us how to look at Heavenly Bodies he's teaching us how to re read when politics come into play Israel becomes a nation now notice what Jesus said when you see the Fig Tree begin to put forth its Birds know that amen hallelujah and then he also say that this generation shall not pass away which Generation The Generation that sees Israel go back to her Homeland so when she starts to put forth fig leaves is in Spring but he says know that summer is at end summer is when the fruit is on the tree Hallelujah he says this generation shall not pass away until all these things be fulfilled hallelujah amen praise the Lord now we know a generation is 40 years and a generation pass aways passes away at 80 years so if you go do the math you'll see what the year is when did Israel become a nation you add 80 years to that because that's the time that that generation which Sayes the return of Israel to the Homeland will start to pass away praise the Lord amen amen now the reason why I'm saying this things are happening all around us at such rapid speed and we don't give a thought to it because we are one about making five R to buy something to eat we are worried about making money we are worried about amen taking care the of the Affairs of Our Lives which is we should be taking care of these things but our focus should be more spiritual amen amen our focus should be our eyes fixed when we reading the news when we are seeing the signs Amen in the heavens we reading the news we seeing politics we should be seeing it because the whole world was open to us amen things happening to us and you're the prophet would say something in the message the angel of the Lord he says over on the east coast they are hollering at me why are you going to the West Coast everybody pulls out to Los Angeles maybe that's God's place now why is he saying maybe that's God's place somebody tell me where zza Street Revival took place see maybe we don't know but it was in Los Angeles Aza Street was in Los Angeles or he's still in Los Angeles and what signified isza Street the power of God came down amen you read about isza Street read about isza Street go and read about isza Street it was a start of the age 1906 started the age now that was a sign the start of the age amen William amen you know William yeah William started 1906 another William was born 1909 amen hallelujah they were there to do do the will of I am amen that's William amen broken up Will i Am praise the Lord amen so do your own work right read about isza Street read about isza Street you read about isza Street amen all the young ones I'm asking you to read about theza Street praise the lord it's important the history is important it started there in Los Angeles and we know anytime the Holy Ghost pours out it's the fire of God pouring out the fire of God spread from Los Angeles yes praise the Lord amen maybe that's God's place that's right he says right here is probably where judgment will strike is this a prophet yes amen amen right here is probably where judgment will strike and that's right let's get ready my this will probably be the first Place it'll be hit amen come on somebody you're looking for [Music] judgments the prophet of God is saying this will probably be the first now watch something about this Prophet let's read again righte here is probably where judgment will strike that's right let's get ready now why would he say my he's seeing something this will probably be the first place it'll be hit right in here amen oh Church of God hold to God's unchanging hand pray praise the Lord so if judgments are coming upon the Earth where is it going to hit first praise the Lord he says look here my friend if God lets America get by with Big Time Frolic to be just if America can go free without receiving judgment a just God will have to resurrect Sodom and gomorah and apologize for sinking them he owes Sodom and gomorah an apology if he don't receive judgment look what's going on in Sodom and Gomorrah and man as vice versa with his body has run around with women and women with men until you get the modern steps of these things and if you don't you can get them that perversion is on a rage another sign yes yes am just when you think the morals can't get any lower they get lower until even it's claimed that a great percentage of our capital is homosexual and that's proving true even now praise the Lord it's on such a range in big cities like Los Angeles till I think each year it goes over 20% from the year before narcotics opium smoking cigarettes how about you say oh that's normal things he's saying it's signs they get these little teenage girls out give them marijuana what do they do tell them a little friendly drink till it's got to a place they don't know that raises passions in human life little boys and girls till they becoming completely insane I say they have become completely insane before if a woman wanted to be an ungodly woman and a prostitute you knew where to find her now in their own bedrooms they are prostitutes amen they have a little camera on from the from their bedrooms they're broadcasting to the wall they prostitution people are making millions and millions doing this business amen [Music] hallelujah and Sons and Daughters of God should not be indulging in this kind of material praise the Lord he says I was reading your paper today this little teenage couple down there killing nine people not a sign if that boy would have come to Christ by a Godly mother and father they wouldn't have took place it's parent delinquency cuz instead of a is now how did it start brother Brandon here was here's how it starts instead of a mother staying home taking care of her babies like she ought to she gets some babysitter to do it and she's out to the ballroom somewhere some big cocktail party and then call yourself a Christian shame on you you can't be by your fruits you are known true that poor little baby they say go talk to most homosexuals if not all of them you will find that they were molested as a child these are proper steps something perverted them Hallelujah in amen I'm glad I only read people are so shy to even agree with what I am saying amen people are shy to agree with what I'm saying it's as if they don't know these things but perversion is all around but we shouldn't get caught up in this perversion amen It's The Sign of Sodom amen hallelujah Abraham wasn't sneaking once in a while down to Sodom to have a good time he wasn't going there on a Friday night to watch mov movies with lot amen praise the Lord amen amen now the prophet of God did something to start judgment upon Los Angeles you would know about this amen you that read the message he says he was standing beside a great canyon eight or 10 times higher than this building he says fire came down from the heavens so God does God have fire can God start fires amen hallelujah does God have Hil Stones can God assist in battles you'll find there in the Battle of Joshua amen there the hailstones killed more than Joshua's Army praise the Lord Fire come down from Heavens like a worldwind now you go and see this fire that started they're talking about a fire tornado go see this there in the news M they call it fire tornadoes are you hear what the prophet is saying now fire come down from heaven like a worldwind just a few feet above where I was standing ripped the Rocks right out of the mountains went on through cut the tops of mcet trees amen everyone running trying to get under the trucks it went back again clapped like a great Thunder went back to the skies again come down he done there three times and when he it was all over they come and asked what did it mean I said I don't want to tell you it was a judgment sign in a few days a great earthquake is going to strike on the west and it won't stop somebody say it won't stop stop amen that that earthquake that struck there on the west is not stopped the prophet says it won't stop California Los Angeles will sink amen it's going down she'll slide right into the ocean and two days after that the Alaskan earthquake shook Alaska and then the last meeting I had in California while speaking didn't know nothing happened till I got on the street so the prophet was under inspiration you can pick it up in the message the prophet is speaking and at the end of the service he's he to prophesy and he says capernium capernium the city that's called by the name of angels that's Los Angeles mean City of Angels Fallen Angels right not the angels of God you've exalted yourself into heaven because that's not the City of Angels of God's angels amen I better leave where the city of God's angels is you may not believe me you've exalted yourself into heaven but you'll be brought down into hell for if the mighty work has been done in Sodom that's been done in you it would have been standing till this day that's the prophet speaking now he says now the last few days is a great roaring popping here come out a paper of science it's all Anor it's got to go under they just know it and the water will come Plum back into the salt and sea now if you're interested go and read about the salt and sea go see where it is go see how he is saying what the water will come right back into the salt and sea praise the Lord the prophet is giving details he's not prophesying I see somewhere that something is going to happen he's giving names he's giving specifics amen praise the Lord Los Angeles is doomed for judgment I tell you before it happens now watch something the earthquake he's talking about already happened then he goes down he says Los Angeles is do doomed for judgment I tell you before it happens that you may know when it does happen I never spoke that by myself and I've never had to tell him I've never had him tell me one thing but what happened and you can bear record of that I went out amen I listened went back such as scriptures Jesus said the same words amen now he says the same God that put Sodom in the sea for its sins the same God that put capernium in the sea for his sins the same God who put Los Angeles in the sea for its sin that city of corruption now many of you would have seen the clip the Golden Globes Award the whole St making a joke yes amen that mom's got so many mentions paston crew got so many mentions and she so proudly saying God got zero mentions and then she talks about she says it's not shocking or not surprising in this Godless city that was January 6th January 7th the fire started amen now note that Los Angeles is a big city it's one of the largest cities amen if you go and read at the magnitude of the fire it was a small portion of Los Angeles compared to the entire state but there were five fires that started amen praise the Lord the same God that put Sodom Under the Sea capernum Under the Sea is the same God that's going to put Los Angeles in the sea for its sin the city of corruption praise the Lord and you know that's where these demon possessed singers the demon possessed actors amen so don't ever become fans of demon possessed people don't have crush on a demon possessed person amen never mind how much they make your heart drop amen no matter how cute they are God don't dwell in Beauty that's right amen amen the prophet of God says I don't care if the guy's feet stinks like a what he says when the Caleb is laughing the feet smells brother no praise the Lord like a skun or one of these things he says if he's a born again Christian amen because water soap will sorted out praise the Lord he says don't care now that how he Combs his hair and how he's got cute amen she's got cute toes amen there some guys who only look at toes if she got one crooked toe doesn't want her amen don't want have nothing to do with her praise the Lord he says you don't choose your wife that way you can have the most beautiful wife the prophet says a Beauty will fade amen as time goes on beauty Fades praise the Lord so he says if you fell in love with a pretty set of eyes those eyes will start to dim praise the Lord a goodlooking face he says you'll start to wrinkle but he says go for character choose character praise the Lord amen I want to skip the next one there amen and get down to the next one just to reiterate some things here the prophet is showing us about signs he says you've seen it in the radio you've seen it on television it's been in the newspaper flying sources everywhere and the Pentagon let it out the other day it wasn't fictitious they even showed it on television how they caught these sources with intelligent light that come from hanging over the Pentagon all over Washington and they caught it on radar had Pilots up there that come right in around them surround them and move away with lightning speed and intelligent what is it Jesus said there would be fearful signs sights in the heavens man's heart failing for fear perplexity of times distress between nations don't you see that seed time is here now the hours time so he's saying all of these signs are showing you that there's a word born bride I'm going to summarize what he's saying there's a bride coming to maturity when you see these signs amen increasing you know the bride is coming to maturity praise the Lord amen so he he goes on to tell you amen about I want to get down to paragraph 79 okay maybe just before that I just want to read something that amen I'm going to close now but I want to read something maybe 78 we get to the next quote the he says now what happened we see a RW in the paper across the televisions out across the Nations where five Stars just fell in line with the world what's five a number of Grace every time those stars come that then something happens on the earth what taken place five stars fell in introducing of what since then just look at what's been taking place Germany almost washed off the map so he's showing you God he's showing you the sign in the heaven first some of the Magi said that the world would burst like a watermelon even distressful things prophesied by them for the last days look what taken place England the other day had a storm that blowed away 70,000 houses in one day I am trying to show you the prophet is looking at what we call natural disasters and phenomenon and he's showing you that it's scripture coming to pass amen he's talking about hes being washed away in England he's talking about Germany being washed away flooding that's what he's talking about have we had floods here in der South Africa amen but don't we take these things as climate change they put a word on it they put a word on it climate change but it is God showing us signs in the heavens the judgments of God are striking the Earth yes amen but so I'm trying to say that these things are to make us being more prepared and waiting now for because the Lord is going to come to change our bodies oh yes Lord praise the Lord amen 70,000 houses in one day now you would you can do the steps you can see how many people would died now in the fires how many homes were destroyed amen I'm just trying to connect and show you that the prophet placed judgment upon that City and when the prophet places judgment upon his City it must come to pass disasters everywhere California Los Angeles like to be like to washed into the ocean what is it beginning of Sorrows earthquakes has picked up everywhere what is it five stars come in line Grace God's grace what happened now watch he going to give you a clue now these five stars coming in line see what he says here now five stars God's Grace what happened an infant Church Hallelujah Pride infancy that the power of God is begin to fall on her am amen so would there be another sign to show the church coming to maturity if he showed a sign in the infancy amen if five stars came in line to show the [Music] infancy will they line again for the maturity yes praise the Lord the bride in its infancy that the power of God has began to fall an infant Church a bride infancy that the power of God is begin to fall on her she is taking form a bride for this bride gr that three stars meant his Perfection of the heavenly father of the Trinity becoming one on earth amongst us God's offices becoming one office what happened now it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the the word of God now if you were looking at the stars you would never know this meaning but yeah the problem of God is giving you the meaning of the Stars lining up amen the church coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing a approach might not believe that but it's the word just the same what's happening he says I'm closing I might say this friends the church is coming forth God's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle and she's predestinated God said he would have it that makes it right who's a member I don't know I'm trusting to be myself I'm trusting you are a member but he's going to have a body without spot a wrinkle and I believe that the latterday signs and things that's happening every one of them is peeling together to show that Christ is ready to come for this bride amen amen amen praise the Lord God in his word made manifest in a man the perfect man so is God in his word coming again and making himself manifested in a bride amen praise the Lord I'm just trying to hit the highlights of this word amen I believe it's the announcement now they'll come a day that won't be called day or night but but in the evening time it shall be light amen he tells you that Civilization travels from the East to the West praise the Lord he says that same Sun that shines that shines with the same power upon Pentecost to ripen the seed that he planted the same sun is shining now in the Western Hemisphere to ripen the seed that's been planted to bring forth a bride the evening Light gospel will bring forth a bride right the next one he says now of us would think that power cuts and blackouts is a sign most of us would write esom a letter or go on the false thing there report of fault blackouts are a sign the prophet in the Rapture message now isn't it strange that not long ago on the East Coast a big the big black out ah but they didn't have enough they didn't have enough energy right now all this city uh this entire place that the fires all the electrical wires and everything got burned there's blackouts there they couldn't understand it Texas blacked out last week they couldn't they can't understand it don't you realize that that's a sign don't you know the nations are breaking Israel is in a Homeland and these signs are indicating that we are at the end the same time it's blacking out don't you know that's a sign the prophet said but there'll be there shall be light in the evening time that the light will come forth in the evening time when the blackouts and things are going the way they are now look at it how it blacked out the pope just come over here remember up at the Tabernacle you got the tapes amen how the Lord showed there exactly what those Church ages would be how they would be I had them draw out on the board then church ages draw out on the board if the Holy Spirit didn't come down in a big Pillar of Fire went right back there on the wall and draw it out itself with three or 400 people sitting looking at it and just as a pop started over here the moon Sumer blacked out and they took their pictures the same way that it was dra up in the heavens on the platform right so the prophet is saying he walked up 13 steps amen went to the made a trip on the 13th walked up 13 steps serve communion to 13 to a nation that's a number 13 blackouts coming everywhere don't you see where we at we at the end time amen there's no difference in time than what it was now he says but when you see these things begin to happen raise up your head get ready something could happen at any time Christ come for his church praise the Lord one more thing here about how this is the last quote I'm going to read he says then Jesus Christ said in his ministry when this gospel has been preached to all the world ham Shem and Jeff's people then he would come again now those planets Heavenly planets as they move around they separated now those planets they separated right they've never been on the earth since known but every so 100 years they cross their Cycles like this if they happen to be an astronomer here you might know what she's talking about I don't he says they cross like that and in Comm commemoration of the greatest gift that was ever given to mankind when God gave his son on earth when these planets cross themselves again why he said he sends another gift to the Earth so he's talking about this astronomer that was talking to him on the bus he says you were born on the crossing of that time and said that's the reason I knew it praise the Lord so when we are looking at all of these signs we shouldn't become like all things are continuing the same it's not if we look I'm going to eat some highlights now if we look at the progression of events that has transpired I want you to see that these were not ordinary things that took place on the earth the legalization of homosexuality was no ordinary thing you know that took place under the Obama Administration and then he got fil with the rest of the Western world even South Africa legalized it but that's a sign of Sodom don't ever become comfortable with it I don't care whether it's your cousin your brother your sister whereever it is we can't become comfortable with sin if they don't get their life together and repent you are going to be separated from them eternally forever one day amen so we should never compromise with sin praise the Lord I know some of you are inclusive people they teach you these things at workplace so that thing becomes part of your culture yeah you know we must respect all people eh God told Abraham separate yourself amen how about they nice people my best friend watch that Spirit don't jump on you then you'll become good friends praise the Lord the prophet says don't see how close you can get to sin see how far away the woman that was delivered from a dance hall she sto to hear the music it says before she knew it she was in the arms of her man dancing demon Spirit got onto her you know the story if you don't know it please start to read the messages we are living in a serious time and a serious hour am praise the Lord the rise of women in politics wasn't this all part of the Visions the rise of woman in politics and in the church praise the Lord those are signs
