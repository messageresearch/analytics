[21:11] Ephesians and is bringing out a
[21:14] remarkable statement
[21:16] not only a statement to the Ephesians

[21:30] the word through a prophetic Ministry
[21:33] amen yes

[22:57] has brought us
[22:59] so that we will learn

[24:33] word now is embedded in the hearts of
[24:36] the Bride yes to be established in the
[24:39] unity and in the fight towards the
[24:42] mystical body of understanding that we
[24:45] are one in Christ amen come on Church

[24:51] okay and those things that cannot be

[25:06] kingdom that cannot be shook or moved
[25:09] that that's the kingdom of God
[25:15] hallelujah amen
[25:17] I love that amen and a message token he
[25:20] says here every promise in the Bible is
[25:24] yours yes amen it belongs to you amen
[25:28] when this token is upon you and God has
[25:32] sealed you now we want to check
[25:35] ourselves just for a moment amen
[25:41] when God has given you the true baptism
[25:44] of the Holy Spirit
[25:46] then the life of Jesus Christ
[25:50] is within you amen
[25:52] you see how important it is to receive
[25:57] the Holy Ghost yes amen the promise is
[26:00] given unto you and to your children even
[26:04] as many as the Lord thy God shall come
[26:08] amen
[26:09] praise the Lord amen
[26:12] when God give me the true baptism of the
[26:15] Holy Ghost then the light of Jesus
[26:18] Christ is within you now that's true
[26:21] amen
[26:22] and every Theologian will have to admit
[26:27] that yes we got no room for theologians
[26:32] yes amen
[26:33] we are moved by the influence and the
[26:36] characteristic of the Holy Spirit within
[26:39] us in the time frame of Grace to utilize
[26:43] the god-given gift to work out our
[26:46] salvation with fear and internally yes
[26:49] amen hallelujah
[26:53] Amen to me it's the new birth yeah amen
[26:57] we need the new bird
[26:59] the new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[27:02] Christ
[27:03] personality
[27:05] now if we have not the new birth
[27:09] then something is drastically wrong in
[27:14] the manner in which we have been placed
[27:17] in
[27:18] so we need a repentance yes we need
[27:22] something to say a lot nevertheless not
[27:26] Marvel but let your will be done I need
[27:29] a new background I want to make Heaven
[27:31] Lord I want to drive to Heaven Lord yes
[27:33] what shall I do amen with Jesus which is
[27:37] called the Christ
[27:40] and everything that Jesus purchased
[27:44] and promised you
[27:46] in the Bible
[27:48] is yours yes
[27:50] it's your property because it's faithful
[27:54] amen Life Is Mine
[27:58] he paid for it yes life is yours he paid
[28:02] for it healing is mine he paid for it
[28:06] amen healing is yours he paid for it
[28:10] Freedom Is Mine amen he paid for it yes
[28:14] Heaven Is Mine amen he paid for it he
[28:19] has paid the price amen hallelujah
[28:23] everything he purchased belongs to the
[28:27] man that holds the token amen
[28:31] amen he says pass my token
[28:36] upon the streetcar on the day of the
[28:40] judgment
[28:42] wonderful
[28:43] streetcar you remember brother Brandon
[28:46] says in the message entitled the token
[28:49] and then it goes there he says that
[28:52] inspector has to inspect the vehicle
[28:54] make sure everything is tied right yes
[28:57] sits right the bones and this and that
[28:59] is all corrected for it to go into a
[29:03] journey amen so therefore we are also
[29:07] tried and tested
[29:09] in order for us to have the token yes
[29:13] amen we need to display it with the
[29:16] sincerity in in our hearts to understand
[29:19] and know that the Bible principle of
[29:23] receiving the Holy Ghost will be the
[29:26] very nature of Jesus Christ amen amen
[29:32] Hallelujah
[29:33] praise be to God hallelujah
[29:37] right amen
[29:39] he displays himself through you amen
[29:45] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[29:48] yes when you recognize the token the
[29:53] life that it took for the blood to speak
[30:00] there's no other ways that you could get
[30:02] to it amen beside the message of the
[30:05] hours there was a prophetic Ministry and
[30:08] the United Ministry had to come
[30:11] and now everybody says well now okay
[30:16] because the son of man revealed
[30:17] Ministries out here
[30:19] we got the spoken with
[30:21] Ministries in Stanger
[30:23] Durban and surrounding areas they have
[30:26] fellowship and different areas now
[30:29] you're with me yes amen I won't miss out
[30:32] on party Elizabeth also we have the same
[30:35] Spoken Word Fellowship or whatever
[30:37] but the reason
[30:40] why I bring this to you
[30:44] and our subject matter is the mystical
[30:47] body
[30:49] we need to hear what the spirit of God
[30:54] is saying amen it will take a five four
[30:58] minutes amen under the inspiration and
[31:01] revelation of the word of God to inspire
[31:06] your faith that is deep within you Amen
[31:09] to mobilize the effort to a
[31:12] characteristic power of Christ vested in
[31:16] your life and in my life amen
[31:20] too
[31:22] [Music]
[31:23] okay communion
[31:25] we are all watch this
[31:29] we are all by one Spirit baptized into
[31:33] one body amen you know the reason why I
[31:37] said you there are diversities of
[31:39] churches
[31:41] what are they believing today are they
[31:45] believing that which brother Branham has
[31:48] brought in the revealed word for the
[31:50] hour or are they going into a different
[31:54] road map of understanding I think it is
[31:58] so I think it is that I think it is that
[32:01] it is presuming
[32:03] presuming if you venture without
[32:06] Authority yes
[32:08] yes you and brother Branham went and got
[32:11] a clear-cut decision when he went into
[32:13] the woods to get his sermons and
[32:15] whatsoever when God inspired him he came
[32:19] with the same inspiration and divided
[32:22] the word of God into the hearts of men
[32:24] women and children amen so that they
[32:28] will be able to enhance and realize that
[32:31] God is speaking amen praise the Lord

[32:55] same
[32:56] amen
[32:58] yes what was in those standards t24 no
[33:03] one knows but we need to know it will
[33:06] take a profit yeah
[33:08] and the prophet is a Divine revealer of
[33:12] the word of God Amen so the
[33:14] interpretation validated by the
[33:17] scripture and answers a characteristic
[33:20] down payment for the Bride of Jesus
[33:23] Christ to walk in the Highway of
[33:26] Holiness where the footsteps of the
[33:29] righteous is added up the Lord
[33:33] thank you
[33:36] for by one Spirit are we all baptized
[33:38] into one body so
[33:41] what I have
[33:43] you have yes what you have they will
[33:47] have amen they won't be
[33:50] they won't be
[33:53] a difference
[33:54] of opinion
[33:56] to which the scripture amen amen
[34:00] and mystery requires a scripture yes yes
[34:04] a scripture requires a revelation and a
[34:09] revelation
[34:10] requires the manifestation of the
[34:14] scripture in your life and in my life
[34:16] amen come on say Amen
[34:19] okay
[34:21] we want to find out now what is mystica
[34:28] it's having
[34:30] a spiritual meaning
[34:33] or reality that is neither apparent to
[34:38] the senses nor obvious to the
[34:41] intelligence
[34:43] this message is not the intelligence of
[34:47] man yes this message is the intelligence
[34:51] of God Amen let them put Let the mind
[34:55] that was in Christ now in now be in you
[34:59] yes amen it will take the mind of the
[35:02] word of God your mind in spiritual uh

[35:09] scripture for you to have amen undivided
[35:14] attention towards his stewardship at all
[35:17] times amen I say this at all times we
[35:21] cannot play with this message amen
[35:23] Brothers
[35:24] if we are hung in the mystical body
[35:27] wherever you are in your homes Durban

[36:02] on Earth amen so that we could not fall
[36:06] into the uh divided opinions of uh uh of
[36:12] men
[36:14] that's why Paul said I did not come into
[36:17] like Excellency of man's Wisdom but I
[36:21] came under the power and demonstration
[36:24] of the holy spirit amen so the holy
[36:27] spirit gives a divine intervention and a
[36:30] Divine uh revelation of the word to tell

[48:39] pray for leadership
[48:43] you know
[48:47] like I preached on streets I preach on a
[48:49] call down individual
[48:52] under divine
[48:54] leadership

[49:01] leadership
[49:02] and God calls us man yeah God sent you
[49:07] Elijah
[49:08] God said I have chosen you you have not

[49:22] give you all these things so that you
[49:25] will be able to be a child a son and a

[49:31] Faith could be instilled in the hearts
[49:34] of men women and children
[49:36] praise the Lord hallelujah
[49:43] he says here now I can't believe that
[49:45] God would ever take such a thing in his
[49:48] church he speaks about another
[49:50] cleanliness you know all this other kind
[49:52] of thought and whatever it is because
[49:54] it's got to be born of the spirit of God
[49:57] and then cleansed before it can be
[50:01] called his
[50:03] amen
[50:04] can you say amen amen amen so what we
[50:07] have done
[50:09] even baptized when you see the Holy
[50:12] Ghost
[50:13] the Holy Ghost comes makes a way for you
[50:15] and me teaches us how to live how to
[50:19] hack how to understand how to love your
[50:21] enemies how to you know love them they
[50:24] respectfully use you all these kind of
[50:26] things why because it's love it takes
[50:28] perfect Divine love to get there and we
[50:31] need to work it how are we going to work
[50:33] it by the word of God Amen praise the
[50:36] Lord just get down on Earth and pray I
[50:38] know it's difficult but there is some
[50:41] place yes that you could do something
[50:44] that he can do something for you
[50:48] the mystical Body of Christ
[50:51] we are baptized into it
[50:54] by the baptism
[50:56] of the Holy Ghost
[50:58] without that
[51:00] you cannot make it
[51:02] can you say amen amen amen the Holy
[51:05] Ghost is important friends
[51:07] very very important
[51:10] you've got to be born again of the
[51:13] spirit of God or you'll never be able to
[51:15] come on Fellowship grounds with our God
[51:18] Almighty himself
[51:21] um come on
[51:24] for it only upon the basis of the shaped
[51:27] blood that he received any believer amen
[51:31] we have been received say amen amen amen
[51:34] [Music]
[51:37] how can you believe when nothing there
[51:40] to believe
[51:42] our mind
[51:44] that's what's happening with the
[51:46] churches of the message of the hour
[51:47] today
[51:49] I'm not propagated I'm not trying to say
[51:52] this debt on the other but there is a
[51:54] church yes
[51:56] that is called out
[51:57] [Music]
[51:58] in spiritual baptism
[52:01] under the influence of the Holy Ghost
[52:03] amen
[52:04] will have Divine interpretation of the
[52:07] word amen and she will lay in the
[52:10] presence of almighty God to be righteous
[52:13] amen Commando Church
[52:16] Hallelujah
[52:20] it says now he says here as I said
[52:23] mental mental consumption
[52:26] we did not come
[52:30] we did not come
[52:32] by Me by a concept that we think it is
[52:37] no we didn't come
[52:40] we did not come by the rebirth
[52:45] we've come
[52:47] because we were seed yes yes only the
[52:53] election
[52:54] can have that revelation
[52:57] and grow in the power and strength of
[53:01] Jesus Christ amen
[53:08] now because this is what he says
[53:12] he said just a caramel mine through
[53:15] mental conception you can't do it that's
[53:17] a reason people don't believe in Divine
[53:19] uh in Divine Healing because they never
[53:23] walked into that blood stream to The
[53:25] Fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:30] okay you've got an intellectual Faith oh
[53:34] you believe the word and you mix it and
[53:36] make it suit your theology but once you
[53:39] come into the kingdom of God to the
[53:41] blood of the Lord Jesus meeting upon the
[53:43] shed blood brought through the testimony
[53:46] the public testimony of the Clemson
[53:49] blood of the Lord you are in here in
[53:51] Fellowship where God can't bless you
[53:54] amen
[53:56] yes and you can shout and praise the
[54:00] Lord and the powers of God working why
[54:03] in God himself his own body
[54:08] the mystical body of the Lord Jesus
[54:11] Christ here on Earth operating upon the
[54:15] basis of the shed blood
[54:19] oh heavens amen thank you Jesus
[54:22] thank you Jesus
[54:24] see what I mean not upon the braces of
[54:26] the Methodist Baptist a Pentecostal
[54:30] church or any other church not upon the
[54:33] basis of water baptism although it's
[54:35] good it's all right but not upon the
[54:39] basis of water baptism look upon the
[54:41] basis of draining a church
[54:47] joining a church is good but it's upon
[54:50] the braces of the shed blood amen
[54:53] you make a fellowship with the church
[54:56] the congregation but you will never have
[54:59] fellowship with God till you come on his
[55:03] basis his terms amen his term
[55:09] is through the blood yes
[55:14] and through the blood you become a part
[55:17] of him
[55:18] into the same
[55:20] cell
[55:22] that he came out of
[55:26] the same cell
[55:28] that came and went into virgin birth
[55:30] Mary the blood of God
[55:34] and I as I said
[55:37] as the bright and bright room is one
[55:40] that same cell that was in Jesus is the
[55:43] same cell that is in you
[55:49] right
[55:50] and the Very present and part of God
[55:53] comes into you
[55:56] so you came here not because just you
[55:59] want to become yes yes he made it
[56:02] possible amen that you could be here
[56:05] you hear his word not my will but his
[56:10] word when he speaks through the bottle
[56:13] lips of clay where the Branham said it's
[56:16] deity speaking amen amen and you are
[56:20] seated in Christ Jesus in Heavenly
[56:22] places amen what is that a believer's
[56:26] position in Christ amen
[56:31] hallelujah amen by faith you purchase it
[56:34] and that same holy spirit that was in
[56:37] the Lord Jesus Christ comes into you
[56:41] amen
[56:42] and then you are Sons and Daughters of
[56:45] God abducted by the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:49] into the body of Christ

[56:54] amen
[56:57] he's such a wonderful God
[56:59] that he showed you every way according
[57:03] to the scriptures
[57:05] and how he took a prophetic Ministry
[57:08] to bring light into our hearts
[57:11] that we will be able through that light
[57:14] understand
[57:16] the verbatim of the word of God that has
[57:19] been entrusted to us in the end time
[57:23] [Music]

[57:54] body now amen the body of the
[57:57] resurrected ones from sin into life amen
[58:02] it's no longer I get limit but Christ
[58:05] that liveth in me we don't sin anymore
[58:08] we are living a life that is worthy of
[58:12] the gospel God has separated us from a
[58:15] life of sin to eternal life by the word
[58:18] of God to be substantiated on the
[58:21] minutes of divine fellowship with him
[58:24] the person of Jesus Christ in the
[58:26] mystical body amen
[58:32] he is in the mystical body now the body
[58:34] of the resurrected ones from sin into

[58:51] human flesh where he could touch but he
[58:54] was born of Burden then out there giving
[58:57] his life to be crucified to cleanse
[59:01] sinful men and he could live right among
[59:04] men what love that God has for men yes
[59:09] that he unfolded himself down to make a
[59:14] clean place that he could live and love

[59:38] help us oh God
[59:40] especially your church
[59:43] them that baptized into that mystery
[59:46] Body of Christ

[59:52] you said as a son of man ascended up
[59:57] so shall his body Ascend up
[1:00:00] and he is the head his church is the
[1:00:04] body of God it's the head that guides
[1:00:09] the body let the headship of the word

[1:00:42] amen we are just enjoying laying in his
[1:00:45] presence yet the Church of the Living
[1:00:47] God so that he could speak to us the
[1:00:50] Divine uh word of God that will
[1:00:53] establish Us in the faith that we may
[1:00:55] work out and go into another higher
[1:00:59] dimension in the power of Grace
[1:01:03] um
[1:01:04] now
[1:01:08] don't get the Rapture of the church and
[1:01:11] the white Throne judgment mixed up
[1:01:16] because the Rapture of the church there
[1:01:19] is no judgment
[1:01:21] there's no judgment
[1:01:23] Revelation 10 came down
[1:01:26] 101 came down the Earthly Angel was on
[1:01:30] Earth at the time of his coming
[1:01:32] judgment is over
[1:01:35] everything is over
[1:01:38] you got no judgment
[1:01:40] you're cleansed by the blood amen
[1:01:42] amen you're woven into
[1:01:45] the uh I should say the sting of the
[1:01:49] blood of the Common Thread which is the
[1:01:52] blood of Jesus Christ a fabric that you
[1:01:55] are using Amen to clothe you to have a
[1:02:00] better understanding that God and Murphy
[1:02:03] is with you yes
[1:02:09] Hallelujah
[1:02:11] I love him
[1:02:12] you love him amen so the mystical he
[1:02:16] says but the mystical is not the
[1:02:18] denominations
[1:02:20] don't have anything to do with the
[1:02:23] denominations
[1:02:24] [Music]
[1:02:26] you're a church that's why we don't
[1:02:28] treat Church
[1:02:29] we need to be serious if I want to
[1:02:32] worship God I need to be serious amen
[1:02:33] yes if I want my family to be saved I
[1:02:36] need to do things right yes my wife
[1:02:38] wants to do things like my husband needs
[1:02:40] to do things but my children need to do
[1:02:42] things like everybody needs to do things
[1:02:44] right then all will be all right yeah
[1:02:46] they're down on your knees and pray you
[1:02:48] know when we were young and the children
[1:02:50] were going to school what a privilege it
[1:02:53] was to to get them done under in the
[1:02:56] lounge and then get down on our knees
[1:02:58] read the Bible and pray and seek God's
[1:03:02] intervention for our lives
[1:03:04] as they grow they go to school they go
[1:03:07] to universities they go here they go
[1:03:10] there and they connect themselves in
[1:03:13] different things suno related the
[1:03:15] lukewarmness comes in
[1:03:17] so we need to throw the word of the word
[1:03:22] to read Kindle
[1:03:24] the want of the fires of God
[1:03:28] to be removed to remove those things
[1:03:31] that easily beset them to be a living
[1:03:35] testimony for Jesus Christ
[1:03:40] Hallelujah
[1:03:44] the mystical body of Jesus Christ by one
[1:03:47] Spirit right we are all immersed into
[1:03:50] his one body
[1:03:52] then the token is on the door for you
[1:03:54] are in Christ
[1:03:56] and he was the one your sacrifice who
[1:04:00] stood the judgment
[1:04:02] and when God looks upon that he can't do
[1:04:09] anything amen applied the token he can't
[1:04:13] do a thing
[1:04:15] you are just as safe as you can be
[1:04:19] because God and Christ is the self
[1:04:23] same person
[1:04:26] the spirit being made flesh
[1:04:32] dwell Among Us
[1:04:34] and there is god with his own
[1:04:37] with his own self and you his own
[1:04:40] children into the body

[1:05:05] of his spirit
[1:05:07] down from yourself

[1:05:11] this very message which is the baptism
[1:05:14] of the Holy Ghost to take you into the
[1:05:17] dimensional power of Grace to learn and
[1:05:22] understand that it is concerning the
[1:05:25] word of the Lord the message of the hour
[1:05:27] in our day that we are living in amen
[1:05:31] huh
[1:05:33] it says now you can hear the word
[1:05:35] preached you can look at it and admit
[1:05:38] that it's right
[1:05:40] Cain did
