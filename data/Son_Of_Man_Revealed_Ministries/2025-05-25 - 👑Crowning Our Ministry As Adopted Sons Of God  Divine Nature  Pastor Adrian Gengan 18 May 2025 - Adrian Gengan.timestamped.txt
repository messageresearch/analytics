[0:06] Amen. Father, we thank you, Lord, that
[0:08] you have chosen us. You've called us,
[0:10] Father, Lord, for such a time as this.
[0:13] We excited in our hearts, Lord, when we
[0:14] see the time and the season that we are
[0:16] living in, oh God, knowing that we are
[0:18] the closing of the Gentile dispensation,
[0:20] oh God. And father, how it behooves us,
[0:22] Lord, to seek your face, Lord, to Lord,
[0:25] be dedicated to you, oh God, and keep
[0:27] our lampstream and burning and be ready,
[0:30] oh God, for that time, oh God, when you
[0:32] shall come and change these vile bodies,
[0:34] oh God, these mortal bodies from mortal
[0:36] to immortality, oh God. And Lord, you've
[0:39] sent us a word to give us rapturing
[0:40] faith, oh God. And I pray, Lord, even as
[0:43] we come together this morning with our
[0:44] little licks of fire, oh God, that Lord,
[0:46] we can rejoice around your word, rejoice
[0:49] around your truth, oh God. Father,
[0:50] because greater is he that's in us than
[0:52] he that's in the world, oh God. We know
[0:54] that no weapon formed against us shall
[0:56] prosper, oh God. You are God who watches
[0:58] over us, who cares for us, who loves us.
[1:00] Oh God, and we give you praise and
[1:02] worship this morning and adore your
[1:04] mighty name, oh God. I pray, Lord, that
[1:06] you'll receive the songs of Zion that
[1:08] have been sung, oh God. I pray Lord that
[1:10] your name will be greatly exalted oh
[1:12] God. And I pray Lord that you would
[1:13] receive the worship, receive our praise,
[1:16] receive our thanksgiving, oh God. And
[1:18] now even as we come Lord to sit at your
[1:20] feet and hear your word. I pray Lord
[1:21] you'll break the bread of life. We ask
[1:23] it now in the mighty name of our Lord
[1:25] and Savior Jesus Christ with much
[1:27] thanksgiving. Amen. Amen. I greet you
[1:30] all in the precious the holy name of our
[1:32] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Our
[1:35] Lord, he's a sovereign God. He's a
[1:37] sovereign king. Amen. And you know, we
[1:40] are baptized into the kingdom and every
[1:42] kingdom has a king and every kingdom has
[1:45] a law. Amen. So, we want to be able to
[1:47] operate in these principles. Amen. So,
[1:49] we welcome every one of you in the house
[1:51] of the Lord. Amen. Brother Joshua and
[1:53] his family are not here this morning.
[1:54] Brother Joshua's preaching at Tabernacle
[1:57] this morning. Amen. So, we pray that the
[1:59] Lord will be with them. Bless them
[2:01] there. Amen. We also have Sister
[2:02] Matilda. Amen. Visiting with us. Amen.
[2:05] She asked to be to come to church this
[2:07] morning. A dad's been here. Amen. She's
[2:09] been here. Amen. She's reminding me a
[2:11] few years ago when we did the baptism.
[2:13] Amen. I don't know if you remember that.
[2:15] So, let's welcome Sister Matilda. Amen.
[2:18] Praise the Lord. So, dad worked shifts.
[2:21] Amen. So, he's was unable to come, but
[2:23] I'm praying, Amen. One of these days
[2:24] he'll be able to come to the service.
[2:26] Amen. So, we pray, Amen, the Lord will
[2:29] bless you this morning and speak to your
[2:31] heart. Amen. Praise the Lord. You ready
[2:32] for the word of the Lord? Amen. Let's
[2:35] get to Amen. There's a portion of
[2:36] scripture in Luke chapter
[2:43] 15. Hallelujah. Luke chapter 15 from
[2:47] verse 11. It says, "A certain man had
[2:50] two sons and the younger of them said to
[2:52] his father, father, give me the portion
[2:55] of goods that faith to me and he divided
[2:59] unto them his
[3:00] living." And not many days after the
[3:03] youngest son gathered allto together and
[3:04] took his journey into a far country and
[3:07] there wasted his substance with
[3:09] righteous righteous living. And when he
[3:12] had spent all there arose a mighty
[3:15] famine in the land and he began to be in
[3:17] want. Amen. You know there's a famine in
[3:19] the land. Amen. Not for food only but
[3:22] for the word of God. Amen. So there's a
[3:25] famine in the land. And he went and
[3:27] joined himself to a citizen of that
[3:29] country and sent him into his fields to
[3:33] feed swine. So he Amen. He he went to
[3:35] some denomination. He went to a
[3:36] Leodysian church. Amen. And he would
[3:39] fain and filled his belly with the ask
[3:41] of the swine. Amen. That the swine did
[3:44] eat and no man gave unto him. You can
[3:48] see that's all they have to offer. Amen.
[3:52] And when he came to himself, he said,
[3:54] "How many hired servants of my father
[3:56] have bread enough to spare, and I perish
[3:59] with
[4:01] hunger? And I will arise and go to my
[4:03] father, and I will say unto him, Father,
[4:05] I have sinned against heaven and before
[4:08] thee, and am no more worthy to be called
[4:10] thy son. Make me as one of thy hired
[4:13] servants." And he arose and came to his
[4:16] father. But when he was yet a great way
[4:19] off, his father saw him and had
[4:21] compassion and ran and fell on his neck
[4:24] and kissed him. And the son said unto
[4:27] him, "Father, I have sinned against
[4:29] heaven and in thy sight, and am no more
[4:32] worthy to be called thy son." But the
[4:34] father said to the servants, "Bring
[4:36] forth the best robe, and put it on him,
[4:39] and put a ring on his hand, and shoe on
[4:41] his feet. And bring thither either the
[4:44] fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat
[4:46] and be merry. For this my son was dead,
[4:49] and he's alive again. He was lost and is
[4:52] found." And they began to be merry.
[4:55] Amen. The Lord had blessings through the
[4:57] reading of his word. You may be seated.
[4:58] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[5:08] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, amen.
[5:11] We'll be looking at a few things this
[5:12] morning. I may not be able to get to
[5:14] everything, but I might deal with one
[5:15] aspect.
[5:17] Amen. And this is we are living in a
[5:21] time at the crowning of our ministry as
[5:23] adopted sons of God.
[5:27] Amen. It's the crowning of our ministry.
[5:31] And the final crown that will be given
[5:33] to us is the changing of the body. That
[5:36] will be the final process in the stages
[5:38] of adoption.
[5:40] Hallelujah. When you're seeing the
[5:42] father give the son a new robe, that is
[5:45] speaking of a new body.
[5:48] Amen. So we are changing from a earthly
[5:52] robe from a mortal robe to a heavenly
[5:54] robe. Amen. So what we're dealing with
[5:58] today may be just divine nature. Amen.
[6:02] So I want you to follow this and if
[6:03] you're writing it down in order for us
[6:05] to become to our crowning of our
[6:07] ministry, there are stages which we are
[6:10] going to
[6:11] follow. First it's got to deal with
[6:13] divine
[6:14] nature. Amen. And where does nature come
[6:18] from? It comes from the seed.
[6:21] Amen. Nature comes from the
[6:23] characteristics of a seed. So whatever
[6:26] seed I give you to plant and if you
[6:28] plant it in the ground in the right kind
[6:31] of conditions in the right kind of
[6:33] atmosphere you are going to get the
[6:36] potentials that's laying in that seed.
[6:38] If I gave you an orange seed and you
[6:40] planted that orange seed I can't come to
[6:42] you and expect to get avocados.
[6:46] Amen. So we what we are seeing is the
[6:49] nature of the
[6:50] seed. Now last week we were dealing with
[6:53] a few thoughts. Amen. And maybe we'll
[6:55] continue with some of those thoughts is
[6:56] that we as sons and daughters of God
[6:59] have come predestinated on the earth.
[7:03] Amen. God has predestinated us. And I
[7:07] want you to see something very beautiful
[7:08] that the Lord has
[7:10] done because you know you know our
[7:13] brother Brandham. Now I don't have
[7:14] quotes here to show it to you but I'm
[7:16] going to reference a few things. Amen.
[7:18] So I you can go home and do the
[7:20] homework. How's that?
[7:23] Amen. So I'll just preach it this
[7:26] morning and you can go home and
[7:28] reference it. So a lot of it is coming
[7:30] from the spoken word is the original
[7:31] seed invisible union and marriage of the
[7:34] lamb and all of those messages.
[7:36] Amen. So what happened was Satan got to
[7:41] Eve before Adam got to her.
[7:45] Amen. Adam was Eve's guide. Adam was
[7:48] Eve's spirit of truth.
[7:51] Adam was the one she should have
[7:53] consulted, but she left the guide. Adam
[7:56] was her teacher. She left the teacher.
[7:59] Amen. And she went off reasoning with
[8:03] the serpent instead of going back to her
[8:05] guide and her teacher and her spirit of
[8:08] truth. But she left it. Amen. And the
[8:11] the prophet is telling us that Adam's
[8:13] bride fell.
[8:16] Then he's telling us that when Jesus
[8:18] came on the earth that he found that his
[8:20] bride was already impregnated with
[8:22] creeds and dogmas. No matter how he
[8:25] tried to speak to the scribes and the
[8:26] Pharisees, they were already
[8:28] indoctrinated. They had mixed the word
[8:30] with their creeds and their
[8:32] dogmas. And no matter how he tried to
[8:34] explain the word to them, they had
[8:36] already taken seed and
[8:39] conception. Amen. But what's a beautiful
[8:42] thing the Lord has done. He said that
[8:44] this end time people, this end time
[8:46] bride, she won't fall like that first
[8:48] Eve.
[8:50] Now, if we asked ourselves why, why
[8:52] won't she fall like that first Eve?
[8:55] Number one, she won't stand for creeds
[8:57] and dogmas. She'll only take the pure
[8:59] word of God. She won't take a
[9:02] denominational idea. And she will never
[9:04] leave the guide, the teacher, the Holy
[9:06] Ghost.
[9:08] Amen. But I want to show you what the
[9:10] prophet is saying. why really she can't
[9:12] take another man's
[9:14] seat. And it's only in 1965 when the
[9:17] prophet is about to leave the scene, he
[9:19] starts to talk about gene seed. Now, if
[9:22] you type that up in your message search,
[9:24] just type that word gene or gene seed
[9:27] and look in 1965 and don't look before
[9:30] that because you'll get a lot of Gene
[9:31] Norman. Now, you don't want to read
[9:33] about Gene Norman, right? But the first
[9:36] time he's introducing the thought about
[9:37] gene seed is in 1965.
[9:41] And he starts to tell us that the gene
[9:43] seed has to deal with the nature and the
[9:46] character. And he says that we were
[9:48] predestinated with that gene seed within
[9:50] us.
[9:52] Which means we as the wife of the Lord
[9:54] Jesus Christ already came pregnant.
[9:57] Oh, come on.
[10:01] He already predestinated us with this
[10:03] gene seed.
[10:05] So which means that no and you know that
[10:07] once a woman receives seed that home is
[10:11] shut. No other man's seed can get in
[10:13] there. So seeds of discrepancy can't get
[10:16] to this bride. So somebody can
[10:19] fellowship in a denomination for years
[10:21] and years and years but she will never
[10:23] take the seed of that denomination
[10:25] because she already has a gene seed.
[10:30] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. What are they
[10:33] waiting for? They are waiting for the
[10:35] right conditions, the right atmosphere.
[10:38] Amen. To birth that gene seed. That's
[10:41] like the eagle in the barnyard story.
[10:43] Hallelujah. No matter how long the eagle
[10:46] was in the barnyard, it never got to its
[10:49] full potentials until it heard a scream.
[10:53] Until it heard an eagle scream. Amen.
[10:55] Hallelujah. The prophet describes it in
[10:57] three ways. He says the first time mama
[10:59] eagle screamed this bird on the earth
[11:02] started to recognize I don't belong
[11:04] here. Let me backtrack for those of you
[11:06] who don't know the story. Sometimes you
[11:08] preach things and you think everybody
[11:09] knows it. There was a farmer. Amen. He
[11:13] used to have a chicken chicken
[11:16] uh pen whatever you call it. But one day
[11:20] he got a eagle egg and he put it under
[11:23] the end to
[11:24] etch. Amen. So that eagle etched in a
[11:28] chicken yard and it got and when it was
[11:31] born, Amen. it started to mingle with
[11:33] all the other chickens, little chicks
[11:37] and they tried to feed it the chicken
[11:39] food and it got accustomed to that kind
[11:41] of living. And you know how the the
[11:43] prophet says it it depends how you train
[11:46] your mind
[11:48] because if you think you are limited to
[11:50] this
[11:51] condition, that's the way you'll stay.
[11:53] So this bird never knew it had the
[11:55] ability to
[11:58] fly. Amen. It was earthbound like the
[12:00] chickens, like the environment it is
[12:02] growing around. So watch your
[12:04] environment that you are growing around.
[12:07] Watch the friends you keep. Amen. Watch
[12:10] the type of atmosphere you are
[12:12] around. Amen. Because what we are
[12:15] carrying within us is one of the most
[12:17] important things for the end time people
[12:20] that gene seed. Now if we don't expose
[12:23] that gene seed to the right conditions,
[12:25] we are going to be amen destabilizing
[12:28] God's plan. We are going to be
[12:31] corrupting that seed that's within
[12:34] us. So amen. So this chicken was there
[12:37] always uh sorry the eagle was in the
[12:39] with the chickens always. But one day as
[12:42] this chick as this eagle started to
[12:44] grow, he heard an eagle screaming in the
[12:46] skies. Amen.
[12:49] Now, this chicken, this eagle, while it
[12:51] was in the chicken yard, it always felt
[12:53] uncomfortable. It always felt like it
[12:56] didn't belong there. Amen. When the
[12:58] chickens were clucking, this one had a
[13:00] different cry.
[13:05] Amen. And he started to question them.
[13:08] Why do you all do sprinkling of
[13:10] baptism? And they decided to say, what's
[13:13] wrong with you? This is the way we've
[13:15] always done it here.
[13:19] Amen. So when it heard that cry, brother
[13:23] Brandham says that was the first pull.
[13:25] Something inside recognized,
[13:28] hey, something within me is connecting
[13:31] to that cry out there. Now think of
[13:34] where you were when God calls you.
[13:36] Something connected that you are a child
[13:38] of God. Then you've got to leave every
[13:41] other thing, religion and every other
[13:43] thing and connect with that voice.
[13:46] So remember what was drawing him out of
[13:48] the chicken yard was the voice. So never
[13:51] lose connection with the voice. Amen.
[13:54] Always keep connection with the voice.
[13:57] And brother Brandham is telling us that
[13:59] our connection with the supernatural
[14:01] realm is prayer. So never lose our
[14:04] connection with prayer.
[14:06] So that was the first pull. And and when
[14:08] he heard that eagle cry, Amen. he looked
[14:11] up. Amen. And then the second time,
[14:14] Amen. One day he was there in the
[14:16] chicken yard and he got a great big
[14:20] swoop. The eagle swooped through the
[14:22] chicken yard. Second pull, discernment
[14:24] of spirit. That eagle, Amen. That wind
[14:27] just lifted that bird up a bit.
[14:30] Amen. That wind just swept that eagle up
[14:33] and now it's sitting on the fence. Now
[14:36] under the second pull, you're sitting on
[14:38] the fence. You can You got a choice. You
[14:40] can either go back to the chicken
[14:45] yard or you can wait for the third pull.
[14:51] Amen. Hallelujah. So, if you're sitting
[14:53] on the fence this morning, make sure
[14:56] you're balanced
[14:57] well. And don't fall back into the
[15:00] chicken yard. Amen. Because the third
[15:02] pull is coming to pull you out into the
[15:04] heavenlies. So, mama eagle makes another
[15:06] swoop around that chicken yard. Amen.
[15:08] And she tells that eagle, "Why don't you
[15:10] try to flap your wings this time? I'm
[15:13] bringing about a mighty rushing wind.
[15:15] I'm bringing about my presence through
[15:16] the third pole, through a word that will
[15:18] quicken you." Amen. But you've got to
[15:20] spread your wings and fly. So, mama
[15:22] eagle comes around that chicken yard one
[15:24] more time and she makes a great big
[15:26] swoop. Amen. And this time, the bird
[15:28] starts to fly. Amen.
[15:31] As it flaps its wings, it's learning how
[15:33] to glide. Amen. And then it's soaring
[15:36] high and high until those denominational
[15:39] chickens become something but a little
[15:41] speck.
[15:44] Amen. And as that bird is flying
[15:47] high, they're singing. Amen. I have
[15:51] decided to follow Jesus.
[15:55] No turning back. No turning back. You
[15:59] can take the whole world, but give me
[16:01] Jesus. Hey, it seems lonely out here in
[16:04] the sky. You take the whole world, but
[16:06] give me Jesus. It seems like a lonely
[16:09] walk, but you take the whole world, but
[16:11] give me Jesus. It seems like I must
[16:14] forsake my friends and my families to
[16:15] follow Jesus and the truth, but give me
[16:17] Jesus.
[16:21] Now, when you're when you discover that
[16:23] you got a gene seed within you, when you
[16:26] discover that you're a son of God, that
[16:28] you're a child of God, and you responded
[16:30] to the call, I want you to know that God
[16:33] takes personal responsibility of you.
[16:37] God will never leave you nor forsake
[16:39] you. Amen. You are God's personal
[16:42] property. You are his child. He will
[16:45] always take care of you. Thank you,
[16:47] Lord. Amen. And it is God's
[16:48] responsibility when he places you in his
[16:51] kingdom. And that's why he says when you
[16:53] seek the kingdom, when you seek the Holy
[16:55] Ghost, he says don't worry about all
[16:57] these things. You see your clothing,
[16:59] your food, and all that you have need
[17:00] of, it will be added to you. Amen.
[17:03] Hallelujah. And when God adds and he
[17:05] starts to give it to you, Amen. you
[17:07] can't contain his blessings. You've just
[17:09] got to enjoy his blessings. Amen.
[17:12] Hallelujah. So, I want you to understand
[17:15] this morning. I'll say it again. God has
[17:17] taken personal responsibility over you.
[17:20] God takes personal responsibility over
[17:22] your soul. God takes personal
[17:23] responsibility over your life. So don't
[17:26] be thinking that God has forgotten you.
[17:28] God will never forget you. Amen.
[17:35] Philippians 4:19 says, "But my God shall
[17:38] supply all your need according to his
[17:41] riches in glory by Christ Jesus."
[17:44] So God is working to to give us
[17:47] everything we desire in this life.
[17:49] Amen. But you know why? Why sometimes
[17:52] they are limited in in opening up to us.
[17:54] God is molding character
[17:57] and God is developing character the
[18:00] nature that he's given us now because
[18:02] once that gene seed starts to birth it
[18:05] is now going to manifest the nature and
[18:07] he's dealing with divine nature first.
[18:09] So like I was telling you you need to
[18:11] write this down. First comes divine
[18:13] nature when that seed comes to life.
[18:18] Then he's going to develop divine
[18:20] character.
[18:22] And out of divine character is going to
[18:24] come divine power.
[18:27] And out of divine power, you're going to
[18:29] see the glory of Adam back on the earth.
[18:33] So it's first the divine nature which is
[18:36] working on. And that's why you'll see
[18:38] he's given us divine nature. And I told
[18:41] you what the acronym means for DNA. It's
[18:44] not it's not the local scientific
[18:48] term. DNA means divine nature
[18:53] attributes. Amen. Praise the Lord. So
[18:57] Philippians 4:19 says, "My God shall
[18:59] supply all your need according to his
[19:01] riches in glory by Christ Jesus."
[19:05] Now when you say, now how many of you
[19:07] know that all means all?
[19:11] Hallelujah.
[19:12] All means all. So if you know that
[19:15] you're a son of God, I want you to make
[19:17] a demand on God.
[19:22] Jesus said you have not because you ask
[19:24] not. And if you ask, you ask, you miss.
[19:28] He said ask and you shall receive.
[19:31] Seek and you shall find. Knock and the
[19:33] door shall be opened unto you.
[19:36] Hallelujah. We need to strip ourselves
[19:38] of pride. You know, sometimes you can be
[19:40] in a household, but you can have pride.
[19:43] Pride to ask your
[19:44] father, pride to ask your mother, and
[19:47] you're asking everyone else to go ask
[19:50] them because we have pride to humble
[19:53] ourselves. The Bible says, "Humble
[19:55] yourselves before the Lord." Amen. Let
[19:58] us drop our
[19:59] attitudes. Let us drop Amen. uh all
[20:02] these things that we have. Sometimes God
[20:04] is working on our nature but we are so
[20:08] arrogant. We are so
[20:10] prideful. Amen. We have anger issues.
[20:14] We have Amen. problems with the flesh.
[20:18] And the spirit man needs to overcome the
[20:20] flesh man.
[20:22] Hallelujah. Don't let me pull my camera
[20:24] out again and show you what the problem
[20:26] is.
[20:32] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[20:34] Because brother Brandham says enemy
[20:36] number one, he was pointing to his
[20:38] flesh. He says this is the guy that's
[20:40] stopping me from coming to everything
[20:42] that I need to be. So we're dealing
[20:44] tonight this morning with just the
[20:46] divine nature. So the divine nature
[20:49] can't be the same nature of the world.
[20:50] But like you got a anger problem and a
[20:53] temper problem like a bus. The prophet
[20:55] says, you know, the prophet also had an
[20:58] anger problem, a temper one time. Amen.
[21:01] That person shot his dog and he went
[21:03] grabbed his rifle. He said, "I'll kill
[21:06] this man." He said, "This he took your
[21:08] life. I'll take his life." And he was
[21:11] determined and he was going after this
[21:13] man to kill him. But he said his father
[21:15] caught a hold of him, gave him a nice
[21:18] hiding. I think in the spiritual realm
[21:21] too sometimes father aba father needs to
[21:23] catch a hold of us and give us a nice
[21:28] spanking because we feel we are right in
[21:30] our own eyes. Let me tell you something
[21:32] if you are not accountable to somebody
[21:34] and you can't take correction something
[21:35] is wrong with your spirit.
[21:39] If you can't take correction from
[21:40] anybody or somebody something is wrong
[21:42] with your spirit. Every time somebody
[21:44] tries to correct you you always got a
[21:46] problem and you say no but I Why don't
[21:48] you keep quiet? Hear what they are
[21:50] saying and say Lord is this you working
[21:53] on my you know Lord the Lord can use any
[21:55] situation
[21:58] daily situations we are going through
[22:00] the Lord is using those situations to
[22:02] mold me and shape me you're saying Lord
[22:05] give me patience give me temperance now
[22:06] he presents you to a problem and you're
[22:08] going and you're giving this person and
[22:09] you're hammering them and you're kicking
[22:13] them then you're going again and you're
[22:15] saying Lord teach me Lord your ways
[22:17] teach me give me your nature the next
[22:19] time they come up and then you do the
[22:20] same thing. You're not learning your
[22:21] lesson. So the Lord's going to keep you
[22:24] in a holding pattern. And when he keeps
[22:26] you in that holding pattern, blessings
[22:27] are cut off from you. Provision is cut
[22:30] off from you.
[22:34] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So to deal
[22:37] with the divine nature, God is going to
[22:39] mold us and shape us. Hallelujah. Praise
[22:43] the Lord. We can't contaminate the seed.
[22:47] The gene seed must be preserved and must
[22:50] be nurtured in the right atmosphere of
[22:52] the word of God. And right now, even
[22:54] some people can't take correction.
[22:56] They're getting angry right now. Spirits
[22:58] are raging right now because that's a
[23:00] demon spirit. That's a evil spirit.
[23:03] Hallelujah.
[23:05] Praise the Lord. The Bible says, "Do not
[23:08] rebuke an
[23:09] elder." Now, that's Bible. It says,
[23:12] "Regard the older woman as mothers, the
[23:15] younger woman as sisters."
[23:18] Hallelujah. The Bible says, "If you
[23:20] offend one of my little
[23:22] ones," he says, "If your brother is
[23:24] offended at you, why don't you go to
[23:26] your brother and say, "I'm sorry."
[23:30] Amen. Praise the
[23:33] Lord. Why don't we apply the word in all
[23:37] things? We're dealing with divine
[23:38] nature. Now remember, we all want divine
[23:41] character, divine power, divine
[23:43] glory, but we don't want to sort out the
[23:45] divine
[23:47] nature. We always are saying they're
[23:51] lucky I'm not that old person. Hey, I
[23:53] would have finished them. Which means
[23:55] you never really
[23:58] changed. And you only speak like that in
[24:00] the presence of believers because if
[24:02] that person wasn't around, the believer
[24:04] wasn't around, you probably would have
[24:06] sought them out.
[24:08] And in this day and age, you can break a
[24:11] person's spirit more with words than
[24:13] with just a physical beating.
[24:16] Fire in the tongue.
[24:19] Yeah, you're having bri. You just call
[24:22] that person to speak
[24:25] there. You don't need matches. They'll
[24:28] spit fire
[24:29] there. Praise the Lord. What is the
[24:33] problem? Why are you so angry?
[24:39] Why are you so
[24:41] upset? Now, the Bible says if you allow
[24:45] the word of God to take root in your
[24:47] life, it'll calm your spirit down.
[24:50] Amen. It'll calm your spirit down.
[24:54] And it's proven, science has proven
[24:56] this, that Christians who go to
[24:58] church are the least stress are the most
[25:01] stress-free
[25:03] people, most calm people. Because you
[25:06] can't tell me the word of God is now
[25:08] making you
[25:10] enraged.
[25:13] No. Amen. The word of God is a light.
[25:17] Amen. Light drives away darkness.
[25:21] Amen. The fruits of the spirit. Amen.
[25:24] Let's read that in
[25:25] Galatians. Now, who here would say they
[25:28] got the Holy Spirit? Can I see your
[25:29] hands? And please, everyone listen to me
[25:31] when I say raise your hands. Amen.
[25:33] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[25:34] Everyone's working good this morning.
[25:36] Amen. I see you all want to finish
[25:38] early. That's my incentive. When you
[25:41] listen to me and you obey me, then hey,
[25:42] I I finish
[25:46] early. Praise the
[25:51] Lord. Let's go to Galatians chapter 5
[25:54] and read from verse
[25:59] 22. Maybe we need to read from a bit
[26:02] further up.
[26:04] Let's read from verse 18. Now we just
[26:06] all raised our hand. We got the Holy
[26:08] Spirit. It says, "If you be led by the
[26:10] spirit of the spirit, you are not under
[26:12] the law." Now the works of the flesh are
[26:14] manifest which are these. Now watch the
[26:16] works of the flesh.
[26:18] Adultery,
[26:19] fornication, uncleanness, lchivousness,
[26:23] idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
[26:27] emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
[26:33] heresies. Hey, it doesn't stop there.
[26:35] more envyings, murders, drunkenness,
[26:39] rellings, and such like, of the which I
[26:42] tell you before, as I have also told you
[26:46] in time past, that they which do such
[26:48] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[26:51] God. So, we can't be doing any of these
[26:54] things and and claim to be in the
[26:56] kingdom of God. Right? Here's the point
[26:59] we want to get to in verse 22. The fruit
[27:01] of the spirit is love.
[27:06] joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
[27:11] goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.
[27:16] Against such there is no
[27:20] law. And they that are Christ have
[27:22] crucified the flesh with the affections
[27:24] and lust. If we live in the spirit, let
[27:27] us also walk in the spirit. Now, let's
[27:30] just talk about fruit of the spirit.
[27:34] He's not talking about seed of the
[27:37] spirit. Hallelujah. Which means that
[27:40] when we have been baptized with the Holy
[27:41] Ghost, it will grow from a seed
[27:45] form to a mature state where the Holy
[27:48] Ghost has grown up in you and you're now
[27:52] bearing
[27:52] fruit. So when people come to your tree,
[27:56] let me ask you, how is your garden this
[27:59] morning? How is your tree? Because
[28:02] whatsoever man seweth, that sow also
[28:05] shall he reap. So if you're going to sow
[28:08] anger, what do you think is on your
[28:11] tree? If you're going to sow pride, what
[28:13] do you think is on your tree? If you're
[28:16] going to sow disrespect, what do you
[28:18] think is on your
[28:20] tree? Hallelujah.
[28:24] But if the spirit of Christ be in us,
[28:26] he's saying when the Holy Ghost is fully
[28:28] matured in our life, when somebody comes
[28:30] from to eat of your tree, they're going
[28:32] to find the fruit of love.
[28:37] Hallelujah. And sometimes you don't have
[28:39] to wait for them to come and eat the
[28:41] fruit of your tree because you are
[28:43] bearing such fruit. You can say, "Such
[28:46] as I have, give I unto thee." And you
[28:48] can love somebody. Hallelujah. That's
[28:50] why Jesus said, "Now listen to this. Why
[28:53] would you consider your brothers and
[28:54] your sisters here your enemies when
[28:57] you're going to live with them forever?"
[28:58] But Jesus goes as far as saying, "Love
[29:00] your
[29:04] enemies." Love your enemies. Not, "I
[29:08] will never let it be known from this day
[29:10] forth. They shall never hear my voice
[29:12] again. I will never speak to them
[29:14] again." You think you're Pharaoh.
[29:18] You're writing decrees and laws. You
[29:21] know how Pharaoh said it in the Ten
[29:22] Commandments? He didn't want to see the
[29:24] face of Moses
[29:25] again. Now you're writing laws and
[29:28] decrees. From this day forth, you cut
[29:31] off from my family. You are not my son
[29:33] anymore. Why are you saying things like
[29:36] that? Imagine if Ay Wright said those
[29:40] things instead of saying you are my son,
[29:43] you are my daughter and you will never
[29:45] lose that position. No matter how far
[29:48] away you get from me, I will always love
[29:50] you.
[29:52] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[29:54] Now, love is something that goes beyond
[29:59] faith. Faith, you can move mountains.
[30:01] The prophet says, even the Bible says in
[30:04] first Corinthians, he says, "But if you
[30:06] don't have love, you are
[30:08] nothing." You are nothing. So, you can,
[30:12] the prophet is saying, you can pray for
[30:13] the sick and they can be healed. But
[30:15] they got healed. uh not because you were
[30:17] right. They got healed because of
[30:19] faith. You operated the
[30:22] scripture. Amen.
[30:26] Now they come and they're eating of your
[30:28] fruit. But you don't, like I said, they
[30:31] don't always have to come pluck your
[30:32] fruit. You can go with joy around
[30:34] them. Joy is also a
[30:37] fruit. Amen.
[30:39] Peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
[30:43] goodness, faith. Now take the word all
[30:44] of these words. You can't longsuffer
[30:46] with your brother, the prophet saying,
[30:48] but God is longsuffering with you.
[30:51] You're looking at their one fault and
[30:52] you're criticizing them, but you're
[30:54] sitting there with your own faults. And
[30:56] God must forgive you.
[30:59] Hey, everywhere you go, you got a
[31:05] halo. Amen. You got a halo everywhere
[31:07] you
[31:08] go. And you can look down on
[31:12] everyone. Hallelujah.
[31:15] This person is doing this. This person
[31:17] is doing
[31:19] this. That is not the spirit. Fruit of
[31:22] the spirit.
[31:24] Longsuffering. You know what's
[31:26] longsuffering? The word describes it
[31:29] long. Some people got
[31:34] shortsuffering. Praise the Lord. Now,
[31:39] meekness. Isn't a lamb's likened to
[31:41] meekness? Lambs are meek. You saw a
[31:45] goat. How many of you saw some Tik Tok
[31:47] videos? The goat coming for the people.
[31:50] They go bump into them. The guy tries to
[31:53] dodge it. It goes circles around. It
[31:54] come back. It bump into
[31:56] them. Now we are we are sheep of God,
[31:59] not goats.
[32:03] Praise the Lord. Temperance.
[32:07] Ah
[32:10] temperance. Against such there is no
[32:12] law. How many of you are saying, "Lord,
[32:14] help me with my
[32:17] love. Help me with my joy. Help me with
[32:20] my peace, my longsuffering, my
[32:23] gentleness, my goodness, and faith."
[32:25] Faith is also a fruit of the spirit.
[32:28] People focus more on one fruit
[32:31] only. Amen. Some people are only
[32:34] planting for faith. But he's saying
[32:36] faith is a fruit of the spirit,
[32:38] meekness, temperance. Now remember when
[32:41] we are preaching these things we are
[32:42] preaching it for the development of the
[32:44] body of Christ
[32:46] because these things are hindering the
[32:48] growth for you coming to full adoption.
[32:53] Hallelujah. We're dealing with the
[32:55] nature and like we are saying when the
[32:58] seed is planted the fruit of the spirit
[33:00] amen is love. You're getting all of
[33:02] these fruits on the tree. All of these
[33:05] fruits. Praise the Lord.
[33:12] So when God takes personal
[33:14] responsibility for you, he is concerned
[33:16] about your well-being and how you are
[33:18] developing as a son. Therefore, he puts
[33:20] the Holy Spirit in you which is your
[33:22] guide, your teacher, the spirit of truth
[33:24] to give a report back to him how you are
[33:27] progressing. But the Holy Spirit will
[33:29] also come to give a report on the f to
[33:31] the father on your different stages in
[33:33] the journey.
[33:35] What does my son have need of? Because
[33:38] amen, I'll supply all of his needs. But
[33:41] sometimes you're only going and asking
[33:42] God for money. Sometimes you're only
[33:45] asking God for a certain thing, but God
[33:47] says he wants to supply all of your
[33:49] needs. So which means if you're lacking
[33:51] the fruit of the spirit, he also wants
[33:53] to supply that. If you are lacking
[33:56] spiritual things, he also wants to
[33:57] supply that. Amen. Hallelujah. As much
[34:00] as God is concerned about your natural
[34:02] needs, he's concerned about your
[34:04] spiritual needs. And God has taken
[34:06] responsibility over your spiritual needs
[34:08] as well.
[34:12] You come of age, you're looking for a
[34:14] young man, you're looking for a wife.
[34:16] Amen. To settle down, God says he'll
[34:17] supply all your needs.
[34:21] Amen. As you progress, you need a house,
[34:23] you need a car, God says he supply all
[34:25] your needs. You can't change scripture.
[34:28] Philippians 4:19 said, "My God shall
[34:30] supply all your needs." In the in the
[34:33] book of Psalm verse 50 and 10, it says,
[34:36] "For every beast of the forest is mine,
[34:38] and the cattle upon a thousand hills.
[34:42] Praise the Lord."
[34:45] So everything on this earth is the
[34:47] Lord's. We've got to recognize that we
[34:50] are sons and as sons we can make a claim
[34:52] to father.
[34:54] Hallelujah. You see that we just read
[34:56] there about that rich young ruler and we
[34:58] read how he was down in that pig pen.
[35:01] But something about him knew that he was
[35:04] tied to his
[35:06] father. And he said, "Even the servants
[35:09] in my father's house have more food."
[35:12] Amen. They have bread to spare. But here
[35:15] I'm eating pig's
[35:17] food. Now I want I want you to say God
[35:20] wants to elevate your life this morning.
[35:23] God wants to take you from whatever
[35:24] condition you are in now. Even if you
[35:26] think it's okay condition, it doesn't
[35:28] mean that's where God wants you. Yes,
[35:30] God wants you at a higher level. Thank
[35:32] you, Lord.
[35:35] Now, I'm going to say this. We have
[35:37] received the word. How many of us can
[35:38] say we have received the word? But I'm
[35:41] asking, have we become the word?
[35:44] Receiving is one thing, but have we
[35:46] become the word? We have received the
[35:49] truth. Have we believed the truth? Now,
[35:53] the question is, not only that, when
[35:55] Jesus said, "I am the way, I am the
[35:57] truth, and I am the life.
[36:00] His bride is now the
[36:05] way. His bride is now the truth on the
[36:08] earth. And his bride is now the life
[36:11] upon the earth. If we don't understand
[36:14] that we are the way, the truth and the
[36:16] life right
[36:18] now that we represent God's grace upon
[36:21] the earth, then we don't understand the
[36:23] second for mystery purpose that is its
[36:25] Christ in bright form. that when we are
[36:28] making the statements, it is Christ in
[36:30] us that are making the statements.
[36:32] Christ is still the way. Christ is still
[36:34] the truth and Christ is still the life.
[36:37] But now you are seeing it in bright
[36:38] form.
[36:43] We have received the living bread of
[36:45] life. We have eaten the bread of life.
[36:47] Now the question is, have we become the
[36:49] bread of life so others can eat?
[36:54] Amen. Jesus said he is the way to life.
[36:58] We walk in this way to life. The
[37:00] question is have we become the way for
[37:02] others to follow? Have we become the
[37:05] other the way so others we can lead
[37:07] others to
[37:08] life? You see everything that pertain to
[37:11] Jesus Christ in the masculine form is
[37:13] now pertaining to the bride because it's
[37:15] Christ in her in bride form.
[37:19] Hallelujah.
[37:24] He says when we when we are filled with
[37:26] the Holy Spirit we become partakers of
[37:28] the divine not a partaker of the church
[37:31] but partaker of divine nature. The
[37:34] divine nature changing your old vile
[37:36] nature into a nature that loves God. One
[37:39] time we didn't love God but now the Holy
[37:42] Spirit has come within us. We love God.
[37:44] Amen.
[37:46] We believe every word that he said is
[37:49] the truth accepting it as your own
[37:51] personal gift from God. The word of God
[37:53] is his personal gift to us.
[37:56] When a believer comes like that, God
[37:58] gives him a checkbook for any redemptive
[38:01] blessing he died for. If you want to
[38:03] read the blessings you can claim, it's
[38:05] in this book, the book called the Bible.
[38:09] And he says, "You receive a checkbook
[38:11] when you come like this for any
[38:13] redemptive blessing that Amen. that he
[38:17] died for." And Jesus name is signed at
[38:19] the bottom of it. Praise the Lord. You
[38:22] see, here's a
[38:26] check. Lord,
[38:31] help. Here's a
[38:34] check. It says it's signed Jesus Christ
[38:37] at the bottom. Yeah, it's signed
[38:39] here.
[38:43] Now, it's written, "Whosoever believeth
[38:46] in
[38:47] me," that's the one that can cash the
[38:50] check. If you believe on the Lord Jesus
[38:52] Christ, the only place that's left for
[38:55] you to fill is for you to fill what you
[38:58] want.
[39:01] Which means in our modern language, he
[39:03] gave you a blank check.
[39:07] Praise the Lord. Now we can choose to
[39:09] write 50 rand there. We can choose to
[39:12] draw
[39:15] sparingly or we can
[39:19] say I'm a co-air with Jesus and every
[39:23] promise in the book is mine. Every
[39:25] chapter, every verse and every line and
[39:28] we can make a claim based on the word of
[39:30] God. So listen what he says. He says
[39:35] every redemptive blessing he died for
[39:37] and Jesus name is signed at the bottom
[39:38] of it. Are you afraid to fill it
[39:41] out? If you're afraid to fill it out,
[39:44] you're a
[39:45] coward because which means you don't
[39:47] believe the word. You don't believe
[39:49] there's money in the
[39:51] bank.
[39:53] Amen. You don't believe there's money in
[39:55] the bank. You don't believe God can send
[39:58] a camel train
[40:01] to get a Rebecca for you. You don't
[40:04] believe that God can send a camel train
[40:06] to get a Isaac for you.
[40:08] Hallelujah.
[40:12] You don't believe like Lot that God can
[40:14] take care of you where you are right
[40:15] now. So you're looking at Sodom and
[40:17] you're looking at Gomorrah and you're
[40:18] saying, "Let me go and make my place, my
[40:20] dwelling there." But look at how God
[40:22] blessed Abraham.
[40:24] God can come to where you are and
[40:26] blessed your surroundings.
[40:30] You're afraid to fill it out. You're a
[40:31] coward. You can you never have come in
[40:34] contact with God. But once you get in
[40:36] contact with God and the Holy Spirit
[40:38] makes Christ real to your heart. You're
[40:41] not afraid to take God at his word any
[40:43] time to believe cuz you've been in
[40:45] contact with the supernatural. You come
[40:47] back into fellowship. You come back in
[40:50] reconciliation through the blood and
[40:52] believe God. And you know you've been in
[40:54] his divine
[40:55] presence. Praise the
[40:58] Lord.
[41:03] Hallelujah. Now a son who's walking like
[41:05] this controls
[41:09] atmospheres. A son who recognizes his
[41:12] position. You as a son and daughter of
[41:13] God, you control situations
[41:16] with your
[41:18] presence. Hallelujah. And faith can't
[41:21] work up in an emotional
[41:23] state. So your spirit has to remain
[41:26] calm. Praise the Lord. So which means
[41:30] that the next emergency you are going to
[41:32] encounter, how are you encountering that
[41:35] emergency? Are you all
[41:39] panicked? Are you calling for your ma?
[41:43] Are you calling yama? What are you
[41:45] saying at your next emergency? How are
[41:48] you approaching it as a son of
[41:50] God? Because a son and a daughter of God
[41:53] controls
[41:55] everything controls
[41:57] atmospheres, controls situations,
[42:00] controls circumstances. He is not
[42:02] wrestling with flesh and blood. When
[42:04] when your boss comes against you and
[42:06] he's and he's riing and he's raging,
[42:07] your coworker and and you cut off on the
[42:10] street and somebody's is swearing at
[42:12] you, he's not Amen. governed by his
[42:15] external influences.
[42:17] He's just hearing these things and it's
[42:19] bouncing off of him like water off a
[42:21] duck's back because he's covered with an
[42:24] oil, the Holy Ghost oil.
[42:28] So, which means you don't respond to
[42:30] their utterances because that's Satan
[42:32] working to rile you up.
[42:35] Praise the
[42:36] Lord. So, we are controlling everything.
[42:39] You walk into a room and you control
[42:41] atmospheres. You walk into a room and
[42:44] people are squabbbling and fighting. You
[42:45] change the atmosphere because of the
[42:47] presence you
[42:50] carry. You become peacemaker.
[42:54] Hallelujah.
[42:56] Praise the Lord. He's not looking at
[42:58] everything with with carnal eyes but
[43:00] with spiritual eyes. And he's discerning
[43:03] spirits. Praise the Lord. That the two
[43:05] that man that came there to crush every
[43:07] bone in the prophet's body, prophet was
[43:09] able to discern his spirit.
[43:14] Somebody tell you something. Come here.
[43:17] Who you think you're talking
[43:19] to? We always want to react out of the
[43:22] flesh first. Praise the Lord. Amen. The
[43:27] only thunder some people know is they
[43:28] say, "I'll give you one
[43:33] thunder."
[43:35] Amen. What is this? Old nature creeping
[43:38] up. The Bible says, "Behold, Amen. You
[43:41] are a new creation.
[43:43] We sing that song. I'm a new
[43:46] creation. I'm a brand new
[43:49] man. Old things have passed away. I'm
[43:53] born again. More than a conqueror.
[43:57] That's who I am. I'm a new creation. I'm
[44:01] a brand new man.
[44:03] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[44:06] So which means that this person that's
[44:08] controlling atmospheres and and
[44:11] situations, he's not working in
[44:14] anxiety. He's not working in stress.
[44:17] He's not working in
[44:19] fear. You know this the slightest
[44:21] symptom we get, we diagnose
[44:24] ourselves because some of us don't have
[44:26] medical aid. We go to Dr.
[44:29] Google and Dr. Google can be a wide
[44:31] range of what the symptoms you're
[44:34] feeling.
[44:35] and you go for the worst
[44:37] one.
[44:39] Hey, see what Dr. Google is telling me.
[44:42] This must be right. You never even go
[44:45] see a physical GP. You believe
[44:49] Google and you're telling everyone now
[44:52] Google said
[44:55] this. Working in stress, you don't know
[44:58] what he's doing to your body.
[45:02] Prophet says you know worry causes
[45:05] cancer causes sicknesses in our body.
[45:08] We're carrying this worry carrying this
[45:10] fear carrying this anxiety. Amen. But a
[45:14] son is perfectly calm in the midst of
[45:17] the storm. He remains perfectly calm.
[45:19] Others are telling you why why are you
[45:21] sitting
[45:23] here? Why are you not doing
[45:25] something? You're not understanding that
[45:28] person is the son of God and he's
[45:30] controlling atmospheres right now.
[45:34] External influences of demon powers are
[45:36] not going to make him get flustered.
[45:38] He's going to stand up there like a son
[45:40] of God now over that situation and he's
[45:43] going to
[45:46] speak. Praise the Lord. We are going to
[45:49] speak and change atmospheres. So which
[45:52] means our words has power to change an
[45:54] atmosphere. Amen. Go into a volatile
[45:57] room where there's anger and strife and
[45:58] worry. Your words are going to change an
[46:00] atmosphere.
[46:03] You're looking at work and you're
[46:05] looking. The business is not coming in
[46:06] this month. You are not stressed.
[46:08] Neither are you worried. As a son of
[46:10] God, you stand there in your perfect
[46:12] position and you start to thank the Lord
[46:15] for the orders that are coming through,
[46:16] for the business that is coming through.
[46:22] All businesses have budgets. All
[46:24] businesses have targets. You look there
[46:26] on your board and you see what your
[46:27] target is and you thank the father that
[46:29] you have already rece achieved your
[46:31] target for the month.
[46:34] But it's one day before month end. I
[46:36] don't care if it's one day before month
[46:37] end or if it is the day of month end. If
[46:40] you are trusting God to meet you at the
[46:42] point of your needle,
[46:46] Lord, I as your son of God have set this
[46:48] target.
[46:52] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[46:55] You speak I'm talking about the divine
[46:57] nature now. Amen. We've only got time to
[47:00] speak about divine nature right now. But
[47:03] divine nature makes you operate like
[47:05] your father.
[47:08] That's what DNA is. That's what genetic
[47:10] is. That's what gene seed is. Praise the
[47:12] Lord. You speak and you create. Amen.
[47:17] Hallelujah.
[47:18] The prophet says when a son is adopted,
[47:21] you see like what we read there in Luke
[47:22] 15, the father gave him a ring. The
[47:25] father gave him a rope and the father
[47:27] said kill the fatted calf. He says for
[47:30] my son which was dead is now
[47:35] alive. Do you know when you're not
[47:37] making a claim in your father's kingdom,
[47:39] the father thinks you're
[47:44] dead. But he came back to make a claim.
[47:48] Because let me tell you, whether he was
[47:50] making claim as a son or claim on the
[47:53] servants's goods, it was still the
[47:54] father's goods.
[47:58] He thought it'll go in a sneaky way. I
[48:00] want what the servants's got. But even
[48:02] what the servants got is the father's.
[48:08] So the father is saying, "You are my
[48:09] son. You carry my genetics within you."
[48:14] The father doesn't even answer him.
[48:17] He just starts to instruct. This is my
[48:20] boy. You see this? This is my boy.
[48:24] This is my boy.
[48:29] No accusing voice could come before the
[48:31] father.
[48:32] Hallelujah.
[48:35] The accusing voice comes after the
[48:36] adoption. Oh, come on.
[48:39] After he places the robe, after he kills
[48:42] a fed calf, after he gives him a ring,
[48:45] after he adopts him, people get jealous,
[48:48] people get anxiety and stress. Amen. I
[48:52] was you all
[48:54] along. You never killed a cow for
[48:58] me.
[49:00] Amen. It's too late.
[49:03] Now he says whoever this son because
[49:05] he's come to adoption now he can
[49:09] fire that person was in the company 40
[49:12] years if that son now comes and he says
[49:15] you know what you are doing a very bad
[49:17] job
[49:18] here you're
[49:20] fired his firing is as good as a father
[49:23] firing and if he comes now and he says
[49:26] you know what you've been here for 40
[49:27] years which means you're now 65 it's
[49:29] time for you to
[49:31] retire you started this company when
[49:33] you're 25, you've been here 40 years,
[49:36] you're
[49:37] 65, it's time for you to retire. He
[49:40] brings a young man
[49:42] in. He can hire who he wants to hire and
[49:45] fire who he wants to
[49:47] fire. Then he goes to conducting
[49:49] father's business and he says the his
[49:52] signature on the check is as good as the
[49:54] father's. Praise the
[49:57] Lord. Amen.
[50:03] Let's close on
[50:06] this. Last week we were
[50:08] speaking on Peter and John. Peter and
[50:11] John we were telling you is the statue
[50:12] of a perfect man. Hallelujah. From faith
[50:16] to love. Statue of a perfect man coming
[50:19] before there. And somebody made a claim
[50:21] on them. Arms, arms, arms. Somebody was
[50:24] asking. So if somebody's asking a son
[50:27] and daughter of God who is now carries
[50:29] the divine nature of God, you always
[50:31] have something to
[50:33] give. Why are you always thinking
[50:35] monetary? Let me ask you
[50:39] that. The first thing we do is say I got
[50:42] no money. But Peter never told the man
[50:45] silver, silver and gold have I none and
[50:47] walked
[50:48] away. What he had, he said, such as I
[50:51] have give I unto thee. Yeah. So even if
[50:56] somebody's asking you for money and you
[50:58] don't have it, who said you mustn't
[50:59] impart what you
[51:03] have, a divine nature son of God, Peter
[51:07] and John, the fullness of the stature of
[51:09] the perfect man, he's saying, "I don't
[51:11] have what you are asking me for, but I'm
[51:13] going to give you what I
[51:18] have." Hallelujah. People come to your
[51:20] house, they knock there. Can I have some
[51:22] food? You say you don't have food. You
[51:24] say, "Okay, I don't have food, but I've
[51:26] got
[51:28] this." Praise the Lord. So, which means
[51:32] that the the son operating in divine
[51:34] nature is always giving off the fruit of
[51:36] his tree.
[51:40] Hallelujah. Praise the
[51:42] Lord. So, I don't have what you are
[51:45] asking of me, but I can pray for you.
[51:48] That's what Peter and John did. They
[51:50] said, "Such as I have, give I unto thee,
[51:53] and I'm going to meet your greater
[51:56] need." Praise the Lord. Who's going to
[51:59] rise up to that? Who's going to rise up
[52:02] to that? Amen. Hallelujah. Namas, watch
[52:05] how far some people are going to change
[52:06] their giving. That's how humans are.
[52:10] Instead of now giving what they have,
[52:11] they say, "I'd rather give them the five
[52:15] rand." The five rand is easier to give.
[52:18] The 10 rand is easier to give than for
[52:20] you to give something
[52:24] supernatural. Let me say that again.
[52:26] Some people didn't catch it. Some people
[52:29] are going to find it easier to now start
[52:31] giving
[52:32] monetary than to give
[52:37] spiritually because the flesh man always
[52:39] wants to rise
[52:41] up. The prophet says you go to the
[52:43] garage there and the Bowser boy is
[52:45] filling your car. when he comes around.
[52:48] Amen. He says you witness to him. He
[52:51] says you witness to the milkman. He says
[52:54] you witness to your friends at work. He
[52:56] says the the mother doing her duties at
[52:59] home and raising up their child. How
[53:00] many of you know you won't always see
[53:02] the manifestation in high powerful
[53:04] situations like praying for the sick,
[53:06] the glory revealed, like cripples
[53:08] healed. But he says when you are you are
[53:11] a mother at home raising your child, he
[53:12] says there's a manifestation.
[53:16] You are manifesting the son of God
[53:18] again. When you are fulfilling your role
[53:20] and your duty, you're witnessing on the
[53:23] roadside, witnessing to your friends,
[53:25] your loved one. He says there's a
[53:26] manifestation. You are manifesting
[53:28] Christ.
[53:31] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. They ask
[53:34] him a question. Will everyone be able to
[53:36] operate like this? He says no. He says
[53:39] not everyone will have the faith to pray
[53:40] for the blind
[53:42] eyes. He says there because they are
[53:44] different levels of
[53:46] faith. He says but you can manifest your
[53:50] part sometimes you know our what's our
[53:53] part sisters have more of this they have
[53:58] charity they have affection they have
[54:00] love they are thinking hey you know
[54:03] what brother Romesh is staying
[54:06] alone let me cook a nice meal for him
[54:08] and give it to him.
[54:10] Hey, there's a manifestation right
[54:14] there. I know you're saying amen
[54:20] internally.
[54:22] Hallelujah. Let me bake a cake. What I
[54:25] have, what the Lord has given
[54:28] me is just to bake a cake.
[54:32] Even if it's the last oil and meal I
[54:34] have, my manifestation is to bake this
[54:37] cake and give it to the servant of
[54:44] God.
[54:46] Practical
[54:49] manifestation. Hey, I thought we were
[54:51] going to finish on a high here with some
[54:52] amens and some hallelujah.
[54:55] Praise the Lord.
[54:57] I I know you're probably thinking right
[55:01] now, amen. Cuz I'm showing you different
[55:04] forms of
[55:06] manifestation. My gift the Lord has
[55:08] given me for the Kenzo is to make
[55:11] pickle. I make pickle mango and I know
[55:15] brother Sunonny loves pickle mango. So
[55:18] next week I'm bringing him I'm not I'm
[55:20] not putting a claim on you can I don't
[55:23] know if brother Sunny likes pickle
[55:24] mango, right?
[55:27] Maybe he likes lime pickle. I don't
[55:28] know. But I'm trying to show you
[55:31] whatsoever you have,
[55:34] the little you have, you can extend love
[55:37] to somebody and say, "Brother, this is
[55:39] all I
[55:41] have. Can I give this to
[55:45] you?" Amen. Praise the Lord.
[55:50] Some people don't brother Clive maybe
[55:53] don't know how to manifest it but maybe
[55:55] he heard your tap is
[55:57] leaking but now he's got the expertise
[55:59] and the skill such as I have give I unto
[56:02] thee and he comes and he says you know
[56:04] what I'm coming to sort that
[56:07] tap praise the
[56:11] Lord whatsoever the Lord has blessed us
[56:15] with we can use that to be a blessing to
[56:18] others
[56:19] Praise the Lord.
[56:21] The Lord gave me 100,000
[56:25] rand. Now, everyone loves this
[56:28] one. Now, you want to manifest and you
[56:31] say, you know what? Now, don't be like
[56:33] that one and go tell the person the Lord
[56:36] told me you must give me 50,000
[56:39] rand. And that person going to say,
[56:41] funny, the Lord didn't tell me that.
[56:47] Amen. But it must come from your heart.
[56:50] You see a need. You see your brother in
[56:52] need. They can't pay their rent. They
[56:54] can't pay their light account. You
[56:56] overheard the conversation. Hey, I'm
[56:58] behind in my rent. You go and do
[57:00] something for them quietly.
[57:04] Amen. You heard somebody saying they
[57:06] don't have bread. You become their
[57:09] source. There's a manifestation. Amen.
[57:12] So, let me close with this. Hallelujah.
[57:18] So these men, I'm going to dramatize it
[57:20] now as we close. Remember the scribes
[57:22] and the Pharisees wondered about these
[57:24] men. We read the scripture on Wednesday
[57:25] too. They took note that these men had
[57:27] been with
[57:30] Jesus. So which means they did an
[57:34] analysis. They did a test.
[57:39] You're getting it. Brother Romesh also
[57:41] always quick because he's right here up
[57:43] front. always he gets it first. They did
[57:46] a
[57:47] test and their results came back. This
[57:51] men had been with Jesus.
[57:53] They operating like Jesus.
[57:56] Something is wrong because we killed
[57:58] Jesus.
[58:00] We put him in a tomb. We don't know what
[58:03] happened to him, but the soldiers we
[58:05] placed there told us that an angel came
[58:07] and he opened the tomb and Jesus rose
[58:09] from the dead. And we paid those
[58:10] soldiers to keep quiet.
[58:14] Now, how come they're standing before
[58:15] you? These men look
[58:17] different, but they're acting like
[58:19] Jesus.
[58:21] When they speak, things are happening
[58:23] like Jesus did.
[58:25] We thought we got rid of one Jesus. Now
[58:27] they're standing here. Peter and John,
[58:29] who's just like Jesus.
[58:32] So, which means they did a DNA test.
[58:39] And when Jesus was in the tomb, when
[58:41] they killed him, they did a DNA test
[58:43] because Jesus always claimed that God
[58:45] was his father. So the first DNA test
[58:48] they did was on Jesus Christ. They said,
[58:50] "Now we got him. He's dead." They took a
[58:53] sample, went to their labs, and they
[58:55] tested this thing. They ran it through
[58:57] their database, and they found no match
[59:01] because all their database had was
[59:03] earthly fathers.
[59:07] Praise the Lord.
[59:11] Praise the Lord. So, they couldn't trace
[59:13] his DNA back to
[59:15] Joseph. That's what they found. They I'm
[59:19] dramatizing this. Please allow me the
[59:21] liberty to dramatize it. They they they
[59:24] thought they were going to finally find
[59:26] that his birth was traced back to
[59:28] Joseph, but they couldn't find human DNA
[59:31] in him.
[59:33] So they wondered was God his father?
[59:36] Really? Remember this Roman soldier when
[59:39] he died in the that it went dark in the
[59:41] middle of the day. He said truly this
[59:42] was the son of God.
[59:47] Peter I mean the pilot even said I find
[59:50] no fault with this man. He's got perfect
[59:52] DNA.
[59:58] Hallelujah. Yes.
[1:00:01] So now they had Jesus's DNA sample. Now
[1:00:04] they caught Peter and John and they
[1:00:05] threw them in
[1:00:07] prison. Praise the
[1:00:11] Lord. They threw them in prison and they
[1:00:13] took samples from them and they tested
[1:00:16] their DNA. How come these men were able
[1:00:19] to speak and this man
[1:00:22] arose? Let's test their DNA. see maybe
[1:00:26] something they got supernatural power or
[1:00:28] something here. So they started to do a
[1:00:30] DNA test on them and the results came
[1:00:33] back and they found something
[1:00:37] astonishing. Remember these men had just
[1:00:39] been baptized with the Holy
[1:00:41] Ghost. So which means they were no
[1:00:43] longer the
[1:00:44] son. What's was Simon's father's name?
[1:00:47] Barjonah. He was no longer the son of
[1:00:49] Bjona. And John was no longer the sons
[1:00:52] of of uh Zebedee. They couldn't trace
[1:00:56] him. They said, "But we know your
[1:00:57] father, but your DNA is not tracing back
[1:01:00] to Baja.
[1:01:02] Your DNA is not tracing back to
[1:01:04] Zebedee." In fact, when we are looking
[1:01:06] at the sample, your sample is exactly
[1:01:08] like Jesus.
[1:01:13] The DNA results are coming the same. We
[1:01:16] can find no earthly trace.
[1:01:19] Your DNA results are the same. We find
[1:01:21] the same faith that was in you is in
[1:01:23] Jesus. The same virtue in you is in
[1:01:25] Jesus. The same temperance in you is in
[1:01:27] Jesus. The same knowledge in you is in
[1:01:29] Jesus. The same godliness in you is in
[1:01:32] Jesus. The same brotherly kindness in
[1:01:34] you is in Jesus. The same love that's in
[1:01:36] you is in Jesus. The DNA results came
[1:01:38] back the same.
[1:01:42] Because of the gene seed.
[1:01:46] I'll close by saying this again. Maybe
[1:01:48] you didn't catch it earlier. God sealed
[1:01:50] your womb by sending you with the DNA
[1:01:52] seed that you can take no earthly seed
[1:01:55] of any man-made creed or dogma. Let's
[1:01:57] stand. Give God a good ankle clap of
[1:01:59] praise. Amen.
[1:02:01] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Crowning
[1:02:05] our ministry as adopted sons of God. So
[1:02:08] I say maybe some of us still have work
[1:02:10] to do in the aspect of divine nature.
[1:02:12] Let's get rid of anger, temperance. I
[1:02:14] mean, let's get rid of anger and and uh
[1:02:16] this illtempers and and all of these
[1:02:18] backbitings and gossipings and fightings
[1:02:21] and those are not natures of the sons of
[1:02:24] God. Now, no, you know, sometimes the
[1:02:27] flesh man is the prophet says sticky
[1:02:29] nature is always there. But you stop
[1:02:31] immediately and say, "No, no, no, no.
[1:02:32] Something is wrong. Lord, this thing is
[1:02:35] going to bow to me today."
[1:02:38] This nature is going to bow to me today.
[1:02:40] I will not allow this to dominate my
[1:02:42] life.
[1:02:45] Praise the
[1:02:48] Lord. Praise the
[1:02:50] Lord. Amen. Let's just sing and glorify
[1:02:53] his
[1:02:54] name. Amen. The father is identifying
[1:02:58] you as his
[1:02:59] son. You as the bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:02] Christ, the wife, the prophet says, you
[1:03:05] will not fall like the first Eve fell
[1:03:08] because your womb has been sealed with
[1:03:10] the gene seed. It's time to bring it in
[1:03:13] the right atmosphere, in the right
[1:03:16] conditions. Now remember what I said. If
[1:03:18] you can't take correction from anyone,
[1:03:20] there's something wrong. So which means
[1:03:22] you must be accountable to
[1:03:25] somebody. Who is the person that you are
[1:03:27] accountable to that you can go when you
[1:03:30] know you're wrong and you say, you know
[1:03:31] what, brother, I did this wrong. I know
[1:03:34] I'm wrong. Who are you accountable
[1:03:37] to? Amen.
[1:03:40] Can we find such a person that we can
[1:03:42] say you know what the Bible says why
[1:03:44] don't you confess your faults one to
[1:03:45] another I can go to brother Romesh you
[1:03:48] know what brother Romesh yesterday I
[1:03:49] came over the situation and this person
[1:03:51] made me so angry this is not a true
[1:03:53] story now I'm just dramatizing
[1:03:57] it I came across this situation and this
[1:03:59] person made me so angry and I lost my
[1:04:02] temper with him but that's not who I
[1:04:04] want to be you see I'm having a
[1:04:06] heart-to- heart conversation with you
[1:04:07] that's not who I want to be I know My
[1:04:09] father is. Amen. So I can we pray
[1:04:11] together and pray that I bring this
[1:04:14] thing under
[1:04:15] subjection.
[1:04:20] Amen. Hallelujah. Some of you need to
[1:04:23] give your bush knife back to
[1:04:25] Bobby. Amen. He phoned and he asked for
[1:04:28] it
[1:04:31] back. Let's get rid of all carnal
[1:04:33] nature. If we truly want to see sons of
[1:04:35] God arise, we first start with divine
[1:04:41] nature. Divine nature first. Out of
[1:04:44] nature will come
[1:04:45] character. Praise the Lord. But we just
[1:04:47] dealt with divine nature this morning.
[1:04:52] Amen. Let's just sing. Give me a key
[1:04:54] there. Amen. Praise the Lord. Glory be
[1:04:57] to his name.
[1:05:04] Hallelujah. Thank you
[1:05:07] Jesus. Oh, praise the Lord.
