we shall see our loved ones and that's what the power of the Cross did amen hallelujah though sin came to M the plan of God and death came in but Jesus Christ came to take the sting of death away amen hallelujah and he says because I live you shall live also amen so we know they are resting in a gor glorious body amen a Heavenly Body and we look forward to that day when we shall be reunited with him amen any other visitors we welcome you in Jesus name amen let's turn to our Bible I want to speak this morning for a little thought amen glimpses of the god man and speaking on allowing your Revelation to find expression because whatever we believe you must become yes we can't be professors of the word we can't be only professing things we need to become what we are now preaching about we need to become what we are teaching about amen hallelujah so let's turn to Genesis 126 we'll take our Origins from there amen been dealing with the scripture for a while [Music] amen Genesis 12 126 reads and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea the foul of the air over the cattle over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so now God is God of the heavens and he going to give man rule over the Earth God will do nothing upon the earth except he work through a man amen amen let's turn to Psalm 115 to confirm that amen praise the Lord psalm 115:15 Psalm 115:15 says you are blessed of the Lord which made Heaven and Earth amen you are blessed of the Lord which made Heaven and Earth the heavens even the heavens are the Lords but the Earth had he given to the children of men amen everybody reading that in the Bible amen who does the heavens belong toen and who was the earth given to man that's why he said let them have dominion amen the Lord had blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Hallelujah so we are moving now in our journey to perfect Faith amen amen now is not the time to back down now is not the time to settle down Now's the Time to move full steam ahead amen into what God has called us to do in this time and season amen we have a commission we have a mandate that we need to fulfill on the earth and don't let your life expire without you fulfilling God's plan for your life amen all of us have a mandate all of us have a commission from the Lord something that the Lord wants to use us for and we can't allow ourselves to go to the Grave for those potentials hidden and locked up amen amen hallelujah so we got to ask ourselves Lord what's your plan for me reveal it to me so that I can fulfill your plan because no man knows his days on the earth amen so we must be quick amen we must be swift to to work while we can amen amen hallelujah so we're looking here and and we were looking at aren't you glad that you were made in the image of God amen amen I when I read that it just makes me so excited I wasn't made in the image of an animal I wasn't made in the image of a monkey or chimpanzee but God thought about me amen he formed me in the back part of his mind from before the foundation of the world and he said let us make man in our own image meaning that the that God would make man is from his own self amen we are from the God's substance amen this man will function like God that's what amen likeness means to function like God Made In His Image to have his character and his nature so the only one the closest that the people on the Earth will see to God's love is your love the closest that God they will see to God's faith is your faith amen amen so we have got to present hope to Dying World we have got to present the gospel to a Dying World because out there they are hopeless out there they are searching for answers and the only ones that have the answer is the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so Deuteronomy 11:24 says and now he's talking here to the children of Israel Moses and Joshua he says every place where are The Souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours amen amen amen hallelujah yes he's not talking about somebody sitting idly he's talking about a person who is walking into Victory he's not talking about somebody who's comfortable being seated in a place and allowing other people to fight battles when he's saying every place where on the souls of your foot shall tread shall be yours God is expecting movement from you amen God is expecting you to advance the kingdom yes amen God is expecting you to ascend the Heavenly Realm yes Wonder amen there are dimensions to the Holy Ghost and some people are just satisfied with just a baby process yes amen hallelujah but there are dimensions to the Holy Ghost which we must Ascend and allow him to have his full expression through usen amen every place where on the souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours so Joshua had a work to do Joshua can't sit in a house Joshua must be on the Move amen amen Joshua must be conquering territory amen now when the Lord is speaking to Joshua in Joshua 1:8 he's telling him that the book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth amen so you've got to keep the word on your mouth amen you've got to keep the word of God on your lips amen amen you've got to speak the word of God because the word of God is the most powerful weapon given to a Believer he'll defeat Satan any time any place on any grounds any Circ circumstance can you say Amen to that amen so the book of the Lord shall not depart from thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate there in day and night Glory oh what a what a call we've been asked to come now now remember this is preparation for the battle amen this is now the instruction before he's winning battles before he's conquering territories he's telling you to First learn the word of the Lord keep it in your mouth you can't go into battle based on your own words right you've got to know the word of Goden amen hallelujah so he's saying don't let it depart from your mouth meditate therein day and night amen he's not asking you to meditate on Netflix day and night he's not asking you to meditate on movies or worldly music or things of this world day and night but he's asking you to meditate on the word of the Lord that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein you see every action of ours are based on the word of God and what's written in the word of God that's how we begin to function like God amen amen we become the word made flesh for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous you see a lot of people want that second part they want prosperity in life they want success in life but they don't want the word of God Amen he's showing you the paths of success in your life amen amen meditate on the word keep it in your mouth do according to all that the word is written then Thou shalt have make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success amen hallelujah have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest amen amen praise the Lord Lord now Joshua is going with this word what a word to go out into battle with what a word from the Lord for Joshua his son to say my son I'm going to be with you be thou strong and courageous keep the word of the Lord and I'm going to fight your battles amen so here we find in Joshua chapter 10 now amen Joshua is going into battle and we find here Joshua is going to call on the name we're speaking on glimpses of the god man we speaking on man having Dominion yes now he's in the midst of a heated battle and the Sun is going down amen and he needs light he says if we allow them this enemies to go and regroup and refresh themselves amen they're going to amen be able to fight stronger so he says I have need of the sun to be there I have need of light amen so a Son of God comes into his position oh yes a super anointing comes over Joshua amen amen he just met the angel of the Lord the captain of the host hallelujah praise the Lord GL and he stands in his position as a son yes he knows that the Earth is given to the son Children of Men and he stands there and he begins to speak to the Son and the Bible says then Joshua spake then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he says son stand thou still upon gibian now he does only speak to the sun he speaks to the moon and moon in the valley of aelon amen and the sun Stood Still your words carry power amen Earth responds when you speak amen a Son of God in a position Earth has got to respond to your voice amen we don't realize what power we carry within us when we are filled with the Holy Ghost amen we are Sons and Daughters of the most high God we carry the authority with all of Heaven backing us up amen I don't know whether you believe that or not amen but a son and daughter of God Amen the most powerful force on the earth no demon power can stand before you amen amen Lord praise the Lord amen you were made to be amen a ruler of the earth you were made to have dominion over the Earth and you can't tell me we lost there through the fall then you missed Redemption amen you miss Jesus Christ coming to pay the price for our Redemption because Redemption means to bring you back to your former State AMJ amen amen so don't weaken what Jesus Christ has done don't weaken the blood don't weaken the cross amen because of your unbelief and your lack of faith amen my God is more than able this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever Glory hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah amen I I don't like hanging around intellectual people amen I don't like hanging around psychologists amen I'm talking about doctor degrees in the Christian kingdom amen I'm here with people with an experience amen people who know what they are talking about amen not just professing it from the pilit amen but I've been on the battlefield I've seen the sick being healed amen I've seen amen hands being straightened amen I've have some experience with the gospel I haven't come to preach the word in only but in the power and demonstration amen away with amen church amen doctrines and ideologies that just want to teach it as a Doctrine amen we are here Amen to preach Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection amen amen amen praise the Lord yeah the Bible says amen and the sun Stood Still and the moon stay heavenly bodies of God can even obey you come on now yes bodies can obey your voice yes wonderful praise the Lord until the people have Avenged themselves upon so that that Sun and the Moon stayed there until they avenge themselves upon their enemies amen what about your situation you pray today and the symptom is relieved but you have not fully Avenged that sickness you have not fully Avenged that disease amen you walk away thinking that you must live with it amen that demon power that's in your body illegally has got to leave amen human powers can't attach themselves to your body illegally amen you've got to give them ation notice yes amen amen amen amen hallelujah you know most people as soon as the symptoms ease off a bit they quite comfortable amen and as we get older we think that these things are part of old age and we have to live with it I tell you you don't have to live with it amen we have testimonies where God healed a 80y old man would die iabetes high blood pressure amen and having a sight problem wearing glasses he got prayed for the next morning he wakes up and nobody Sleeps with glasses so he notices amen that he don't have glasses on but he can see clearly I'm giving you a testimony the brother is alive right now you can go and get the testimony amen he goes to check his blood pressure goes to check his sugar levels he had even ulcers he had alers amen all of it completely healed by one prayer the power of the holy ghost moving to his body amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen maybe you never experienced the power of God I tell you raise up the level of your faith this morning amen you'll experience a glimpse of a God man here this morning amen amen and he says there was no day like that before or before it or after it that the Lord aren unto the voice of a man amen God never told him to speak to that moon to the sun he needed it yeah he needed it what is it that you have need of stop being so feeble about your request amen Jesus said you receive not because you ask aiss you've got to ask in the authority of a son amen knowing that you have already received that which you have asked for amen that's true Faith thank you Lord true faith is already knowing you have received what you have asked for amen Lord you know the Bible says God's word will not return void andto him you've got to believe the words coming out of your mouth will not turn empty amen amen hallelujah here's another man we will maybe will speak on a few minutes amen the man called Peter the day Peter let his faith loose a bit Glory you'll see a glimpse of a God man amen just to back it up John 1 140 just to show you who this Peter is one of the two which CH John's speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first finded his own brother Simon and said unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ now you remember that in Matthew chapter 16 Jesus is going to ask him who do you say I am so now the seed is already planted in Peter who this is do you see it in the word does he not tell Jesus Thou Art the Christ but where is he getting the teaching from so he's walking around with this revelation of who Jesus is yes because Andrew introduces this he says we have found the Messiah which being interpreted the Christ and he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah but you know what I I see you with potential amen I think I need to change your name amen yes hallelujah amen the name you got now is okay maybe your Earthly mother and father gave you that name but I see a potential in you Peter amen I see I can work with someone like you you may be rough around the edges you may be not fitting into the norm of society you may be a sinking fisherman amen you know Peter was a wild guy the Bible says he went fishing naked and things like this you know he wasn't your polished guy with a suit amen you know Peter was a bit rough there when they came to Jesus in the Garden of Eden he cut the servant's ear off amen I need a Peter in my life amen hallelujah and you know Jesus took all the evidence away amen Jesus put that ear back because it was a capital punishment for him to cut off the high priest servant's ear they would have killed Peter there so Jesus took away the evidence amen hallelujah he can take away any evidence of sickness disease or illness even before your next doctor's appointment somebody receive that even before your next doctor's appointment amen there will be no trace of it even the doctors will be baffled he'll take away every evidence of it thank you you'll even fight with the doctor and say you told me I had this thing wonderful thank you amen amen Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah thou sht be called sephus which is by interpretation a stone now we know that Peter had a revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and that was amen that Revelation was the revelation of who Jesus Christ was amen so we find here in Matthew chapter 16 we'll go to that point now verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou are John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets amen you see they were delving into the Bible but they couldn't scripturally identify Jesus they bypassed Isaiah 9 Isaiah 7 amen they're bypassing Isaiah 61 amen they're bypassing all of these scriptures and he says to them who do you I need to know who youth say that I am I'm ask you who do you say that Jesus is am and Simon answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Amen and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon B Jonah for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven amen amen every Revelation comes from above amen didn't Jesus say that to you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom Hallelujah and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock what rock he wasn't going to build it upon Peter like the Catholic Church says the Catholic Church misinterprets the scripture and he says Peter was the Rock and he built the church upon Peter so Peter was the first pope that's an incorrect reading of that verse amen when he says Upon This Rock he's meaning the Revelation that you have Peter I'm going to build my kingdom my church I will build my church now notice there personal I will build my church Jesus Takes responsibility for his own church amen this is not my church Hallelujah this is the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ no Pastor no Bishop no Archbishop has claims over the heritage of God amen amen it is God's Church it is Jesus church he says I will build my church amen glory to God Amen Hallelujah I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it what is the it Revelation yes the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against your revelation of who Jesus Christ is amen amen you know what that is I me if you can see that Jesus is speaking a prophetic word yes amen that even 2,000 years may pass but the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against the revelation of the believer wonderful amen that's a prophetic word spoke spoken over his church amen Jesus building a strong powerful Church Jesus building an invincible Army amen the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you because you're an invincible Army amen hallelujah a supernatural Army that can never defeat be defeated that can withstand the attack from the enemy amen withstand the attack from the Gates of Hell amen sometimes you maybe can feel the attacked from the gates of hell they come against you amen yes amen the gates of hell are coming against you Jesus said that the kingdom of God suffereth violence and the violent take it by force I want you to know that the kingdom of God is within you so when the kingdom of God is suffering violence they are coming against [Music] you amen hallelujah but no people Buckle Under Pressure they think oh no I just need to be a bit worldly I just don't need to be so sold out to Jesus Christ I don't need to be a fanatic for Jesus Christ amen I can live my life and enjoy life on the [Music] earth amen people don't realize that they ought to be amen not their own they are bought with a price they are bought with the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you owe your life to Jesus you owe your life young man young woman to serve the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen maybe you're thinking you got your own life amen ahead of you and why can't you just take things easy amen your friends are doing this and your family is doing this amen but why don't you stand out for Jesus amen stand out for Jesus amen yes thank you Lord the gates of hell where are they coming to I said they're coming to you because the kingdom of God is within you amen so they're coming now the gates of hell are coming against you you feeling the pressure from all sides amen hallelujah but where what who are you you Mount Zion so the gates of hell are coming among are coming against Mount Zion yes amen that's what the Bible says amen and and here in Isaiah 14 it says it's coming against the sides of the north yes Satan said I will sit upon the sides of the north the sides of the north is Mount Zion a type of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but you are going to overcome that now I want you to pay attention to Isaiah 4 14: 13 if you go and look at that interpretation of sit that word doesn't mean just I will sit upon the sides of the north that word sit means to marry go look it up he says I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north meaning that Satan wants to take you in for his wife that's right the same thing he did in the Garden of Eden through the serpent before Adam got to to his wife he got to Eve amen so with this with Jesus Christ is called the last Adam so he wants to make a move on the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ and he wants to sit upon the Mount of the congregation Amen on the sides of the north amen but the Bible prophesies and said you want to sit on the sides of the north you'll be brought down to the pit amen hallelujah God won't allow anyone to touch his bride God won't allow want to touch his people amen so a prophetic word is spoken over you the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you you shall overcome every attack of the enemy you will defeat Satan and his army with the word of God that has been released to you amen the word that you carry the Revelation that you carry amen defeats the Gates of Hell makes Satan powerless before you the reason why Satan is not powerless before you you don't speak the word yes amen you've got to take the word into the Battleground amen amen there is no fear no doubt no reasoning there's nothing in this bride that Satan can work through Satan can only work through doubt Satan can only work through fear Satan can only work through reasoning but amen the word of God comes to take away all of that so Satan can find nothing that he can work through amen amen hallelujah and how does God Work hello him God can only work by his word that's his law he works by the logos he finds expression through the logos so therefore he puts his word in you so that he can work through you he can only find expression through the word so if you've got things inside of you beside the word God can't work amen amen praise the Lord and the bride is built on the word amen we know the bride lives by the word the bride moves by the word the bride breaths by the word of God Amen you talk about a military might and strength you shall see this when the bride is fully clothed with the word of God a military army amenallah yeah in Mark 9:23 Jesus is saying if thou can believe some things are possible to you no we don't believe in certain things some things are Beyond us we Opera in a much higher level so we scratch out things that we don't agree with amen if thou can't believe all things amen all things are possible yes young boy young girl brothers and sisters I don't care how small that thing is you may be thinking it's an insignificant thing but God says all things amen are possible to God who believes sorry to God that believes all things are possible to him that believeth Mark 11:23 what does it says if you go to pray and you ask God and God says to the mountain be thou removed right Mark 11:23 says that that you are weak and hopeless and you're so feeble in this life go to God in prayer and if God says to the mountain be thou removed what does it say so God's name is whosoever who's that whosoever amen whosoever shall say unto this mountain this obstacle this circumstance amen be thou removed that is not somebody like a that's a voice of authority amen be thou removed cast into the sea but here's the key anyone can speak right anyone can speak here's the key you speak but he says don't doubt in his heart there's the key now but believe those those things which he he saith not what God saith which he saith shall come to pass and he shall have whatsoever he saith amen God wants you to have confidence in your own word yes God has equipped you with his word he has confidence in you as a son and he wants you to speak over your situation death and life lay in the power of the tongue yes so what are you speaking you know why you speak that way or don't speak lack of speaking is because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks so you got to go and look at your heart condition what is the condition of my heart amen because out of the abundance of my heart I am going to speak yes amen so your heart can't be fearful Matthew 17:20 nothing shall be impossible unto you yes nothing shall be impossible unto you amen amen so here we we were reading there in Matthew chapter 16 and verse 19 says I will give unto you the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou bind on Earth shall be bound in [Music] heaven God is telling you you a son and daughter of God if you bind something on the earth I'll even honor your word in heaven oh church can you see what Authority you carry amen can you see what you carry amen you're a son and daughter of God and God wants to place the responsibility upon you stop being childish stop being a babe in Christ amen you need to grow up to maturity tell your neighbor grow up amen tell your neighbor to grow up grow up we have to grow up in Christ Ephesians 4 says we must grow up up in the things of Christ amen amen amen now in the time of need what do we do what are we called to do according to the word run to the pastor because Mark 16 says if the pastor lays down upon the sick they shall recover never mind now you went to visit the hospital right you went visiting ours you went 2 to 4 because you're free now you went 2 to 4 to the hospital you went there you spoke about all the other stories how you feeling this that you see you got them into the emotions and when you left you said don't worry I'll tell my pastor to come pray for you I'll tell my pastor to come pray for you you know my aunt passed away last week we went to the hospital brother Joshua was there some of the family members were there there's other people came there they didn't care that we were there they were leaving and they asked can we pray before we leave that is having confidence in what you believe now I'll have you know that was a sister not a mage sister but she knew she had the confidence in a prayer wonderful am now I ask you not to make you feel bad how many of you would have done that would you have felt embarrassed would you have felt ah what they going to think about me or do you feel like you represent the kingdom you carry the kingdom within you amen amen and you tell them no I don't care how simple your prayer is even if you don't know how to pray you can quote back the word of God therefore you've got to know the word you can even quote Mark 16 Lord your word says if I lay hands upon the sick they shall recover won't you come and honor your word I'm a Believer and I'm laying hands upon the sick we need spiritually strong Sons and Daughters of God Amen we can't be 30 40 years amen with the revealed word of the hour and operating with no Authority no power you know even in the natural for you to become qualified in something you study three years to get a degree 3 years only to get a degree how many of you have been in the Christian faith more than 3 years amen now in the 3 years you must study all of that manual whatever books they give you right you must study the material they give you after 3 years they put you through a test in an [Music] exam and after 3 years if you pass that exam when you are now in practice you no longer rely on the material because why you are now the material am hallelu so I ask you in your Christian faith why would you qualified 20 years 15 years 10 years going on in faith but walking around as a son with no Authority amen can't give hope to the Hopeless no can't give strength to the feeble amen something is wrong then now we need to ask ourselves am I really a part of the kingdom of God am I really a part of God's program in my life or am I just a church member because you can't just be a church member and you can die like that and you that you won't be functioning in his kingdom right amen and that's a pitiful sight yeah amen that's a sad thing to happen to us amen be strong be strong Christians somebody in the home gets sick you be the one to pray yes whether it's your husband don't feel shy whether it's a wife pray you see we've got to recognize the grace that we carry the anointing that we carry and if you and I can't recognize it in one another the outside world won't recognize it if you and I cannot respect that here the outside world cannot respect it because when it comes to spiritual warfare there is Rank and Authority that's how the kingdom operates the Centurion detailed it for us when he went to Jesus he said I speak I'm a man I'm a I have I'm a man who's under Authority but I also I have authority over 100 men I speak to one and he goes and does it now now here in the kingdom of God if the Deacon tells somebody something you get who you think he is hey I know the pastor so long I know the pastor more long than him it don't matter you know the pastor you follow the authority of the church amen amen hallelujah now when the word is coming strong like the previous pastor he wasn't so hard like this amen you've got to understand how the kingdom operates Hallelujah they are principalities yes they are powers amen hallelujah and if we can't operate in that level of authority and I'm sad to say this but some of us don't know how to function with that level of respect and Authority if you want to see the go to the denominational world and you'll see it evident there they respect the man of God because they know he carries an anointing now how much more us will know that Ephesians 4 is a fivefold Ministry a gift of God that He gave some Apostles teachers prophets pastors evangelists to the church for the edification Amen to bring us into the stature of Christ amen let's just get to the part will close amen now this man is packing Peter he's packing this revelation of who Jesus is and he's going to come into a time now we'll pick it up here in uh Amen in the Book of Matthew chapter 14 we'll read from verse 22 we're going to close with this point now so amen pay attention and straight way Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship so I don't have time to detail this later so I'm going to pick up the highlights now God put them in that position Jesus put them on the ship so don't care what your situation is don't blame God God has put you there for a reason oh yes he wants to see how you function he wants to see how you handle the situation God put all Jesus put all of his 12 disciples there on the ship and to go before him unto the other side where he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea amen I want to tie this with end time events as well very quickly amen now notice in the midst of the sea because in Revelation 13 there's a beast rising from the midst of the sea right but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves and the wind was contrary now we know that winds means Wars and strife I'm trying to show you it's when end time condition people that will rise up like Peter now come on this is not just a Bible story because watch what the next verse says so winds means Wars and strife that means spiritual warfare and in the fourth watch in the fourth right in the Fourth Watch Jesus went unto them walking on the sea amen Jesus is coming at the fourth watch the time when the fourth hor Rider is coming coming the time when all hell he's following the rider amen I'm now in Revelation chapter 4 chapter 3 amen you know that's Revelation chapter 3 amen hallelujah sorry Revelation chapter 6 where he's talking about the Riders amen so he's in the fourth watch but remember there's a fourth anointing which is the flying eagle and there's a fourth Us Rider but here Jesus comes unto them in the fourth hour that fourth hour what of the night is between 3: and 6:00 in the morning Hallelujah when is 3 and six just before 6 and N just before the Rapture hallelujah praise the Lord follow me now and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight away Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou but me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to get to to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind was boisterous he was afraid and began to sink and he cried saying Lord save me now I want you to picture the scene as we close now all other 11 disciples are there as well but only one man rises up the Church of Jesus Christ is on the ship together they are settled there these men have been through Troublesome waters before because if you notice in this story they are not crying out to Jesus for help the only reason they cried out they thought it was a spirit coming towards them and they got afraid they were not crying out to Jesus Lord save us this was not the time when Jesus was asleep on the boat when Jesus said care when they told Jesus carest thou not that we perish this was another time am so they had been these men were fishermen some of them so they had known how to handle the waters but the winds were boisterous Wars and strife coming upon them I'm talking about supernatural Warfare coming against the body of Christ and the 11 disciples are content staying in the boat so the Bible says when he saw that the wind was boisterous he was afraid what happened he took his eyes off of Jesus right and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore do thou doubt and when they were come in when they were come into the ship the wind seized amen then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth Thou Art the Son of God hallelujah amen now I just want to go to the Beast of the sea there in Revelation chap 13 to show you that this was no ordinary storm Jesus saw all of Satan saw all of them together on the ship and he thought I could kill them all in one shot I'll kill the entire church and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority and it was given unto him to make war with the sins and to overcome them so winds we said means Wars and strife amen praise the Lord now before we get into that story a little bit I want to read this quote he says that in this life we are Body Soul and Spirit right we operate by five senses see taste feel smell and hear given to contact your Earthly home they were not given to contact your heavenly home these there's actually six senses in human body see taste feel smell here and Faith his faith sets his destination now your faith is going to set your destination for your life amen faith is a substance of things hoped for evidence of things you do not see taste feel smell or ear but by faith when he catches the word it sends him into a dimension that makes it so real to him till it's just as good as he's got in his hand he knows it's going to happen that's what happened here now to Peter now my question to you is are you comfortable in the message boat amen are you comfortable going with the crowd because there's no move of God in the boat nobody asked Peter to get out of the boat Jesus never called him out of the boat it was himself that desired to go to where Jesus was he knew it was better where Jesus was than it was in the boat he knew it's safer to be where Jesus was than to be in the boat amen amen now the other 11 may have said Peter what are you doing come back in the boat come back to safety we know the safety of the message we know the safety of our doctrines why do you want to be like a god man now the Bible says that they were terrified when they saw Jesus walking on the water and Jesus said it is I Be not Afraid only one man responded to that am amen who the rock of Revelation because faith is a revelation amen and Upon This Rock I will build my church am amen even though the winds are beating on your boat even though the winds are beating on your ship are you still comfortable with your situation amen you know the safer option would have been for Peter to remain in the boat because the waves were high rather than jump in the water amen it was safer to stay in the boat Hallelujah but he saw the master of the wind walking on water now notice something about Peter he never marveled he never stood there and said I will stand back now and witness this great Jesus walking on water Peter immediately knew that this was the Redeemer and to redeem means to bring back to your original condition so he never stood there to admire Jesus walking on the water he said if Jesus can do it I can do it if Jesus can walk on water I can walk on wateren yes Peter don't step out the Bible says he stepped down out of the boat and he must have put his first foot in the water and the message church was calling don't step out onto faith stay with theology it's safer here but Peter dared to be bold amen Peter dared Amen to step out onto the waters by faith amen amen hallelujah let's read that again what he says here he says and pet when Peter screams Lord if it be thou put me come to unto thee on the water yes and he just needed one word Jesus didn't say a whole lot of words Jesus said come amen now that word come is very important because when he said come and Peter responded Peter the super anointing Came Upon Peter and he was caught up into a f Dimension a world that people knew nothing about after that Peter was not the same amen because Peter Peter stepped into the world of perfect Faith the disciples thought he was ordinary the disciples thought he was crazy I'm asking you don't allow people to end your faith if youve got the faith to step out onto water don't allow others to stop you I'm talking about even in your personal life if God has revealed something to you don't allow the naysayers to hold you [Applause] back God called you to do it and sometimes you might you might be the only one that has that word from the Lord like Abraham God may have only spoken to you and you are the only one that can carry out the assignment amen so I must put out every other voice and listen to the voice of God that same word that said come he's the same one in Revelation 4 that says John come up come amen glory to God amen hallelujah amen what is that the world of perfect Faith amen the world of perfect Faith Amen Hallelujah Jesus lived in this world of perfect Faith amen so don't be comfortable in the boat amen hallelujah who has coming to Jesus I mean sorry who has coming to the disciples Jesus and we know that Jesus is the essence of love and the Bible says in 1 John 4:18 there is no fear love but perfect love casted out fear so Jesus coming to them took away their fear Hallelujah so in the midst of your fears can you recognize his voice in the midst of your sickness can you call out to Jesus and say Lord If It Be Your Will can I come out of the sickness thank you Jesus Peter wanted to come out of the boat because the boat was the problem because the boat was swaying in the water that's how life is life is like the waves it's Rocky sometimes it's not smooth sailing all the time amen people are tossed to and fro amen all kinds of things happening to people so Peter wanted to step out by faith amen hallelujah in the midst of your fear can you recognize the voice of God God put in that situation for a purpose if Peter was not put in that situation that Faith would have never been released we just read in the Bible Jesus asked them to go into the ship and we know that Jesus knew things he would have known that storm is coming but he allowed them to go through that season he allowed them to go through that trial why there was a nugget to be polished there now I know you know in the Human Condition most of us are very pessimistic most of us love to go through that verse where Peter fell down in the water you know why we like when others are mediocre like us people don't like to see the others Thrive like to see everyone mediocre amen you know what should have happened there all other 11 should have jumped into the water as well nobody no amens all other 11 should have been inspired by that faith and stepped onto the water but the others stayed back on the ship amen praise the Lord so there's a quote here that says where there is Faith there is love where there is love there is peace where there is peace there is God where God is there is want for nothing more so your faith will be tested your faith must be tested God put Abraham through a test he put all the Old Testament Saints through a test because he wants you to come forth now in your Eden Beauty every Son of God must be child trained must be tested must be tried so I want you to handle your your training like a Son of God I want you to be victorious over every situation that you're encountering amen doesn't matter that 200 million demons have been Unleashed upon you from the river Euphrates amen 200 million demons are let loose upon the Earth and you you're thinking where are these 200 million demons yet you're fighting cancer yet you're fighting heart disease yet you're fighting eye blood pressure yet you're fighting mental battles yet you're fighting mind battles amen all manner of sicknesses coming upon

don't understand that those are demon powers you get big demon demons and you get little imps as well they come and attach themselves to your body illegally amen amen so now they come there you know what spot they come your movie spot because they know now there's no faith there you saying how come these external things that I do are affecting me spiritually you are a three-dimensional being and each one affects the other you can't do things in the flesh and it not affect your spirit man and your soul so now the little room you left for the devil you know when you're going in your car young

slick and the fingers can do the walking and you surf over into your porn Pages allowing demon powers to come in allowing all spirits of lust to come in spirit of lust pride of life lust of the eyes lust of the flesh the pride of life and then we wonder why the people are cankered it's coming in infiltrating subtly amen amen praise the Lord I said this the last time you know that Jesus said that if you look upon a woman to last after people don't like that scripture they say I wish King James never put that there why never Strike it out he has already committed adultery Wither in his heart now we' got some people who have surpassed Solomon with his thousand wives they last up to Every Woman they see so now they got more wives than Solomon because every day they're looking at 100 women so they in a record level now Hallelujah can't you give us a better word now encourage us I'm encouraging to get out of futh yes amen get out of nonsense amen you wonder why you can't have the victory in Christ why you can't have the power of the Holy Ghost flow through your life amen why you can't pray amen amen hallelujah hallelujah people can't pray people can't read their Bible people can't amen set aside time for God God why demon powers are invading you they coming in the waves are tossed against your ship amen and you're being swept by every wind of Doctrine amen hallelujah but I want you to know that you possess within you the spirit of the Flying Eagle now you can SW above the things of the world Amen get into Christ get into the word overcome by the word amen when all of these things come to pull you down the storms of life this is the age of uncertainty you can't rely on stock markets you can't rely on your job you can't rely on these things the only thing you can rely on
