[6:30] Bibles uh we'll take from 1 Corinthians
[6:34] 13 verse
[6:37] 9 let me
[6:40] just read it from
[6:44] here for we know in part and we prophesy
[6:48] in part yes but but when that which is
[6:54] perfect is come
[6:56] amen then that which is in part shall be
[7:00] done away
[7:01] amen when I was a child I spake as a
[7:07] child I understood as a
[7:10] child I thought as a child but when I
[7:14] became a man yes amen we believe we
[7:18] reach maturity in this hour amen amen
[7:21] amen we had to start our work with
[7:23] justification sanctification baptism of
[7:26] the Holy Ghost the the the Christian
[7:28] walk is a progressive
[7:30] walk amen but now when you become a man
[7:34] I put away childish things
[7:37] amen amen so it's not just about coming
[7:40] to I'm just a Christian I have to go to
[7:41] church I have to have a long hair I have
[7:44] to have a long dress I have to have
[7:45] church order not just that
[7:47] anymore for now we see through a glass
[7:50] Darkly but then face to face amen face
[7:55] to face that means the word is in front
[7:57] of you the angel of God appear to you
[8:00] amenah now I know in
[8:03] part but then shall I know even as also
[8:10] I am known amen amen so you are known
[8:14] amen and the only person that knows you
[8:17] is God and the only person that going to
[8:20] show you your true identity is God
[8:23] himself hallelujah amen Psalms 139 1-4
[8:28] says
[8:30] Psalm chapter 139 reading from verse 1
[8:33] to4 it says oh Lord thou has searched me
[8:37] and known me amen thou knowest my Downs
[8:42] sitting and my
[8:44] Uprising thou understanded my thought a
[8:47] far off you see when he went on Calvary
[8:50] he knew all things even before the
[8:52] foundation of the world before you can
[8:54] be manifested on the earth in you your
[8:56] whole
[8:58] life thou compassed me my path and my
[9:02] lying down and are acquainted with all
[9:04] my ways amen therefore we have to always
[9:08] acknowledge the presence of God Amen he
[9:11] knows all things amen for there is not a
[9:15] word in my tongue but L Lord thou
[9:18] knowest it all together whatever you
[9:21] speak in your closet whatever you speak
[9:22] in secret God knows it all
[9:25] Hallelujah so that is why you have to
[9:27] always be conscient of presence but if
[9:31] you got the Holy Ghost even if you
[9:33] thought the wrong thoughts even if you
[9:34] spoke the wrong thing the Holy Ghost
[9:36] there to navate your life bring you back
[9:39] to correction through his word amen amen
[9:43] Let's uh thank God for the reading of
[9:45] his word you may be
[9:48] seated just read a quote
[9:52] quickly the prophet of God in question
[9:55] and answers 64 he
[9:57] says it is referring to 1 Corinthians
[10:00] 133 says when that which is perfect is
[10:02] come that which is in part shall be done
[10:04] away with so all these little things of
[10:06] jumping up and down like a kid trying to
[10:09] talk in tongues and all these other
[10:10] things which when that which is perfect
[10:14] yes and do we have
[10:17] today and sorry and we do have today by
[10:21] God's help yes the perfect
[10:25] interpretation of the word with Divine
[10:28] vindication
[10:29] amen no other age was the word perfectly
[10:35] interpret interpreted with Divine
[10:38] Vindication as in this
[10:41] age amen we not waiting for another
[10:44] interpretation of the word because
[10:46] there's already been a perfect
[10:48] interpretation of the word and therefore
[10:51] the true five4 Ministry is going to take
[10:54] the same word yes amen they're not going
[10:57] to interpret it in another way they're
[10:59] going to make sense to it in other words
[11:01] they're going to bring that word in a
[11:02] present condition amen for the present
[11:05] time for a present people amen amen then
[11:11] that which is in part is done away
[11:15] with when I was a child I spake as a
[11:17] child understood as a child but when I
[11:19] became a man I put away childish things
[11:21] amen I go to preaching and then didn't
[11:24] okay speaking about these things so what
[11:26] he saying we have the perfect
[11:29] interpretation of the word with Divine
[11:32] Vindication so in other words what you
[11:34] have is not a
[11:37] message for childish people
[11:40] yes amen remember the prophet done the
[11:45] ABCs but he was waiting for the message
[11:48] amen the message was for the people that
[11:51] will already come getting ready for the
[11:54] edstone amen they've already buils when
[11:57] now the mind of Christ can come in them
[12:00] amen amen now you can't have the mind of
[12:04] Christ until it comes to the adoption
[12:07] age because the mind of Christ has to
[12:09] come to a mature people amen amen that
[12:12] will understand mature things there was
[12:15] a time when Jesus was on the earth under
[12:17] the first two pools doing Mighty
[12:19] miracles signs and wonders feeding the
[12:21] multitude and so forth but then he come
[12:24] when he comes down he's opening the word
[12:26] these things are only revealed to his
[12:28] inner circle yes to his disciples
[12:31] amen it wasn't for everybody amen so
[12:35] these things are revealed to God's
[12:36] predestinated people amen them that were
[12:40] part of him before the foundations of
[12:43] the world right this is not a public
[12:46] show amen yes amen yes it's spoken in
[12:49] public the message is gone around the
[12:52] world yes but it's not the revelation of
[12:55] it yes amen amen the understanding of it
[12:59] is not for everybody am the plain
[13:03] language of
[13:04] it which is in such Simplicity is not
[13:07] for the whole world Amen it's only for
[13:10] the predestinated yes so he's speaking
[13:12] on a little thought this
[13:15] evening I I now know even as I have been
[13:20] fully known yes amen I now
[13:26] know there was a time we didn't know
[13:30] as we have been fully
[13:31] known but there's a
[13:34] season when the angel of the Lord must
[13:36] come to you
[13:38] yes and fully reveal
[13:41] yourself your part of the scripture amen
[13:45] amen amen there was a season when we had
[13:49] to see that God sent us a prophet there
[13:52] was a season we had to identify what
[13:55] Malachi 4 and 5 came to do yes but now
[13:59] is a season for what you are meant to do
[14:02] amen amen now is a season to understand
[14:05] your scripture because you cannot walk
[14:07] in perfect Faith unless you see yourself
[14:11] in the scripture amen amen and
[14:14] Perfection can only come through Oneness
[14:17] amen you know what I'm saying Perfection
[14:19] comes in other words you have to become
[14:21] one with the
[14:25] word so he's saying we speaking on I now
[14:29] know even as I've been fully known amen
[14:32] cuz God deals with us through election
[14:36] amen God that's how God has always been
[14:39] dealing with things when God chose
[14:41] Israel in the natural he dealt with them
[14:43] through election when he chose Abraham
[14:45] when he was dwelling in the land of the
[14:49] the
[14:51] Chans down there in Babylon he chose him
[14:54] by
[14:57] election when he chose Jacob in the womb
[14:59] he wases by election
[15:02] amen and everything God does he chooses
[15:05] by election that's how he shows his love
[15:07] to us amen
[15:09] amen and we out of this message out of
[15:13] the the The Awakening out of the the
[15:16] word coming to awaken us to take us out
[15:18] of spiritual
[15:20] Amnesia we just thought we were just
[15:22] Christians or some whatever wherever we
[15:25] were and even when we come in the
[15:27] message we just thought yes God sent a
[15:29] prophet he brought proper Church order
[15:31] and doctr which is different from all
[15:32] the other churches which is that's how a
[15:35] Christian Life should be which is sweet
[15:37] because everything is with the Bible
[15:39] this property showing us woman shouldn't
[15:41] preach and all these things these are
[15:43] all in line with scripture that is
[15:44] beautiful and that is sweet and it was
[15:47] good for the season because God word
[15:50] called for a total separation from
[15:51] unbelief yes amen so they had to be
[15:54] cleaning up from out of
[15:57] Egypt amen
[15:59] amen but before entering the
[16:02] Land There have to come circumcision

[16:07] wilderness and not born in Egypt yes

[16:12] Joshua had to get them
[16:13] circumcised to enter the land amen and
[16:16] what the Holy Ghost you're not entering
[16:18] the land
[16:20] amen and the Holy Ghost is not a fancy
[16:23] subjects I'm talking about the true
[16:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[16:27] dwelling in you is not a popular subject
[16:30] am not a popular subject in modern times
[16:32] that we are living in because the Holy
[16:35] Ghost come to the same oldfashioned
[16:36] gospel amen the Holy Ghost hasn't
[16:38] changed his ways the Holy Ghost still
[16:41] ate sin the Holy Ghost is still holy the
[16:43] Holy Ghost still requires only clean
[16:46] lives the Holy Ghost still require
[16:48] consecrated
[16:50] lives amen the pattern is always the
[16:52] same the Holy Ghost still calls you to
[16:55] be an ODOT ball he still calls for a
[16:57] separation from unbelief
[17:00] amen amen he still wants us to separate
[17:03] from the things of the world am because
[17:06] he wants to show you you see the devil
[17:08] keeps wants to remind you that you
[17:10] belong to Mr and Mrs so and
[17:12] so still remind you you come from the
[17:15] chti family you come from the Naidu

[17:21] that you are in that family born in
[17:23] poverty you are the family you had a bad
[17:25] name the that's what the devil wants to
[17:28] do
[17:29] yes but the Holy Ghost wants to remind
[17:32] you you are no longer the son of Charles
[17:36] and Ella Bram you are a son and daughter
[17:40] of God the word has come to make you
[17:42] known as you was
[17:44] known as you are fully
[17:47] known amen it's like
[17:50] that like that
[17:53] slave out there from
[17:57] Africa he was a slave but what made him
[18:01] different from everybody else oh yes he
[18:03] ate the same food like everybody else
[18:06] slept in the same place like everybody
[18:08] else we are like everyone
[18:11] else in terms of that we are trapped in
[18:14] the P
[18:15] house we are living in this world like
[18:18] everyone else we are facing the same
[18:20] Spirits like everybody else we not
[18:23] immune to those things we are facing the
[18:25] same Lan Spirits like everybody else but
[18:29] what makes us different we recognize our
[18:32] identity amen the word has come down to
[18:35] awaken us to our true
[18:37] identity that you are Eternal beings
[18:41] that you are Spirit beings trapped in a
[18:43] flesh body hallelujah amen you're not a
[18:46] you're not a human body with a spirit in
[18:49] it you are a spirit being trapped In the
[18:51] Flesh
[18:53] body therefore you can defy the natural
[18:57] that's the the you can defy
[19:00] Supernatural defy things of world like
[19:03] sicknesses and so forth how do you do
[19:05] that you don't deal with them through
[19:07] your five senses if you are a
[19:09] supernatural being you deal with it
[19:11] supernaturally you recognize Spirits

[19:15] around you you deal with it
[19:17] supernaturally yes you got people with
[19:19] demon spirits around you deal with it
[19:21] supernaturally

[19:27] you in the flesh
[19:29] he wants to always remind you of your
[19:32] failures in the flesh he doesn't want to
[19:35] make you think about what God did for
[19:37] you he doesn't want you to remember he
[19:39] doesn't want you to have this revelation
[19:41] of who you truly are yes because when

[24:05] pool
[24:06] amen yes amen we have the opening of the
[24:10] word not just any word yes we talking

[24:17] the word open you began to see your name
[24:18] in the book yes and now when you and
[24:22] this is the hour when you saw when you
[24:24] saw that then you began to see yourself

[24:41] that's my type he's speaking about Sarah
[24:43] that's my type he's speaking about all
[24:45] these things in a word is my
[24:47] type thou must prophesy again that is me
[24:50] he's showing John they come up a little
[24:52] higher that is me and you began to see
[24:55] that is you then you began to see
[24:59] that yes I was in the written
[25:00] word but now I am the manifested word I
[25:05] am the word made flesh in this
[25:09] hour what what said John John the
[25:12] Baptist apart when he was there on the
[25:13] earth he didn't go say I'm the son of so
[25:17] and so yes he identified I'm the one
[25:20] crying out in the wilderness amen
[25:23] prepare ye the way of the Lord he
[25:25] identified himself in the scripture when
[25:28] the the prophet came he identified
[25:29] himself with the scripture when Jesus
[25:31] was on Earth he took the word and he
[25:33] identified himself in the
[25:36] word so that's what sets you apart amen
[25:39] when you began to see that you are the
[25:41] word made flesh in this hour
[25:44] yes and then if you are the word made
[25:46] flesh in this
[25:47] our then the things that Jesus did you
[25:50] must do also because Christ is the
[25:52] mystery of God revealed and who is the
[25:55] mystery of Christ you and I yes we was
[25:58] the great mystery of Christ hidden in
[26:01] there all along when Christ was doing

[26:10] amen yes from the beginning when he was
[26:13] doing the Redemptive work right there
[26:15] even when he SL slew the lamb and when
[26:17] he put Adam and Eve together it was
[26:19] always Christ and the bride it was
[26:21] always Christ and the bride in
[26:25] everything so everything that Christ did
[26:28] he had you in his thoughts you was the
[26:30] mystery behind it amen but now when you
[26:33] see yourself in the scripture is no
[26:34] longer a mystery amen because now it
[26:37] becomes reality yes it becomes the word
[26:41] made flesh it becomes it becomes now God

[26:52] person Ministry anymore in a many
[26:55] membered body amen the Mystic IAL body
[26:58] of Jesus Christ the body that's from
[27:01] every nation from every tribe every
[27:04] tongue and every Kindred the prophet saw
[27:06] it in a vision amen yes
[27:08] amen and he saw his
[27:12] church so we began to see
[27:19] ourselves let's open to St John

[27:29] St John chap 10
[27:31] 10:3 I and my father are
[27:34] one and then the Jews took up stones
[27:37] again to Stone him and Jesus answered
[27:40] them many good works have I showed you
[27:42] from my father for which of those Works
[27:45] do you Stone me the Jews answered him
[27:47] saying for a good work we stoned the not
[27:50] you see another words when you going to
[27:53] go out pray for the sick and they're
[27:56] going to receive healing they own
[27:58] persecute you for that they don't
[28:00] crucify you for
[28:02] that when you go and do good works
[28:05] speaking nice to things to them they w't
[28:07] do all that but see what it says here
[28:10] but for Blas for me and because that
[28:12] thou being a
[28:14] man make it thyself God
[28:19] yes you see it's hard for people to look
[28:22] Beyond the
[28:23] Veil and I'd be living that hour and now
[28:27] when you began to see I I am more than a
[28:28] normal human being yes amen I am Adam
[28:33] restored again
[28:36] yes I am a Son of God amen amen not a
[28:41] son and daughter of mortal
[28:44] beings but of an eternal God Amen yes

[29:01] is a spirit man amen God is a spirit

[29:09] amen now what is the truth Jesus said if
[29:12] you love me you'll keep my word and my
[29:15] word will not be Grievious he said Thy
[29:17] word is truth amen he said I am the way
[29:21] the truth and the life amen now see when

[29:27] said I am the way amen not I was the way
[29:31] he said I am the way the truth and the
[29:37] life so he's a present God
[29:41] Amen so he says but for bless for me
[29:45] because thou being a man maketh thyself
[29:48] God yes and I can tell you now people
[29:51] will expect they will respect you you
[29:54] got a nice Ministry praying for the sick

[30:34] man because why they are looking at
[30:37] you they're looking at the veil they're
[30:40] looking at the flesh body that you are
[30:42] trapped in they're not looking Beyond
[30:44] the Veil and
[30:46] therefore you know why people don't
[30:48] appreciate the why can't people can't
[30:50] appreciate the true word in the
[30:51] S people look at a monister preaching
[30:54] and they look at the
[30:56] veil they don't look Beyond the veil and
[30:58] say God in that man amen it's not the
[31:01] man that's speaking but God speaking
[31:03] through the man
[31:05] amen these things that we hearing is is
[31:08] not a man but God speaking through the
[31:10] man's voice vocals yes if you want to
[31:14] really appreciate God you got to look
[31:15] Beyond the Veil and understand God by
[31:17] his characteristics amen yes his
[31:20] characteristics are always the same so
[31:23] Jesus answered them said it is not
[31:25] written in your law I said ye are gods
[31:27] if you call them Gods unto whom the word
[31:29] of God came and the scripture cannot be
[31:33] broken yes
[31:35] amen so let me ask you something now who
[31:38] is the word of the Lord coming to in
[31:40] this these days he's coming to the bride
[31:42] thou must prophesy again so who is the
[31:45] bride in this hour amen amateure
[31:49] Gods M Jesus Christ the body of Christ
[31:54] Christ is the head Christ as a body yes
[31:58] Christ as a body that was resurrected in
[32:00] his hour through the words amen yes when
[32:03] the seals were broken amen there was a
[32:05] resurrection amen of the body of Christ
[32:09] amen the body was laying dormant all
[32:11] this time the seals broke and the body
[32:14] came forth amen amen cuz it was a rising
[32:18] of the S so
[32:21] n
[32:23] amen he is the greater light she's the
[32:26] Lesser light she the Moonlight he is the
[32:29] sunlight amen
[32:33] am so the scripture cannot be broken see
[32:36] of him whom the father has Sanctified
[32:38] and sent into the world thou blasphemist
[32:41] because I said I am the Son of
[32:46] God so now for you to identify yourself
[32:50] you are forsaking your Earthly fleshly
[32:52] things and you saying I am a son I am a
[32:55] daughter of God Amen you think it's easy
[32:58] for the people to grasp when you are
[33:00] saying I'm forsaking this flesh I am
[33:03] forsaking my worldly pleasures I'm
[33:05] forsaking the things of this world when
[33:08] you are saying I am I'm from another
[33:10] kingdom my kingdom does not operate like
[33:12] your kingdom amen amen I'm a citizen of
[33:16] another kingdom amen I'm a citizen of a
[33:19] kingdom that is eternal a citizen that
[33:21] can a kingdom that cannot perish in your
[33:24] kingdom you might have democracy in your
[33:27] kingdom you might you you might have
[33:28] your own rights to say what you want to
[33:30] say but in my kingdom my my God has his
[33:35] domain amen yes and he have subjects in
[33:38] his kingdom amen amen and he tell you
[33:40] subject you go there you go there you
[33:42] have this power you have this Authority
[33:45] you have that Authority that is my
[33:47] father's house amen and right now my
[33:50] father's business and I'm operating
[33:52] under my father's Authority in his
[33:54] kingdom from his
[33:56] kingdom you might be operating in this
[33:59] domain but this domain is
[34:01] temporary this domain is inferior to
[34:04] your
[34:05] kingdom amen because when he went on the
[34:08] other side he saw much more Superior
[34:10] things but one of these days there's
[34:12] going to be a renovation yes and he's
[34:15] going to become a superior Kingdom
[34:18] amen but right now this world has been
[34:20] weakened that's why the Bible
[34:22] says God will destroy them that destroy
[34:25] the world this Earth
[34:28] so you find that sin has weakened this
[34:31] Earth Satan has become the god of this
[34:33] evil age taking him 6,000 years to
[34:36] weaken the
[34:38] Earth you see when you see who you are
[34:42] then you begin to see other people
[34:44] around you you begin to see spirits in
[34:46] man when you begin to see that you are a
[34:48] spirit man dwelling in the flesh body
[34:51] then you begin to see Spirit dwelling in
[34:54] bodies yeah because then you have
[34:56] discernments because the spirit within
[34:58] you can discern the spirit within other
[35:00] people that have evil spirits in them
[35:03] and the evil spirits in them will
[35:04] discern the spirit in you the evil
[35:07] spirit wouldn't want to sit around you
[35:09] yeah I'm not talking when you stop
[35:11] talking fleshly things when you stop
[35:13] talking worldly things when you start
[35:15] talking like a son and daughter of God
[35:18] watch the evil spirits reacting yes amen
[35:22] amen you understand what I'm talking
[35:23] about amen start talking like your
[35:25] father amen start talking like
[35:30] Jesus he knew who he was he brought when
[35:33] he spoke he spoke with authority he was
[35:36] convinced of his own word so when you
[35:38] speaking the word you must be convinced
[35:39] of the word
[35:43] amen and he
[35:47] says but if I
[35:49] do do ye believe me not believe the
[35:52] works that you may know and believe that
[35:54] the father is in me and I am I in
[35:58] him so even though they can't understand
[36:02] what you're saying but they must see the
[36:04] manifestation yes they must see The
[36:06] Works in
[36:07] you they must see Christ again amen if
[36:11] we saying we have Christ then they must
[36:12] are you identify Christ Is In You by his
[36:15] characteristics he's the same yesterday
[36:17] today and forever amen we cannot keep
[36:20] saying Christ Hebrews 138 Hebrews 138
[36:23] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[36:24] and forever so we Pro professing to be
[36:27] Sons and Daughters of God then they must
[36:30] believe the works that is being done to
[36:32] us but if there's no Works being done
[36:34] then there's something wrong with our
[36:37] confession amen then we need to
[36:39] reevaluate what we
[36:41] confessing or unless we not even
[36:44] confessing you get what I'm saying
[36:47] because if you got confidence you'll
[36:48] confess yes you'll confess that you are
[36:51] a Christian amen you will not be ashamed
[36:53] to be a
[36:54] Christian no matter where you are no
[36:56] matter which you belong to you'll not be
[36:59] ashamed to identify yourself as a
[37:01] Christian you'll not be identified to
[37:04] not be ashamed to identify listen I'm
[37:06] not like your normal people I'm not like
[37:08] every other human being there's
[37:10] something different about me amen but
[37:13] let them see the difference in your life
[37:14] amen let them see the way you speak let
[37:16] them understand why you have this hope
[37:19] in a time when there's no hope you know
[37:21] we living such a time people have no
[37:22] hope anymore you have conversations
[37:25] around you everyone is negative negative
[37:27] about every situation whether it's their
[37:29] work whether it's politics whether it's
[37:32] their family whether it's their
[37:33] marriages whether it's whatever topic
[37:35] you can think about everything is
[37:38] negative because why Christ was put out
[37:41] of this world they rejected Christ when
[37:44] he come in this day Christ the hope of
[37:46] glory was
[37:48] rejected so when everyone is negative
[37:50] let them see why you have this hope amen
[37:52] let them see why you have this Joy let
[37:55] them see why you have this peace because
[37:58] the peace that Christ gives you no man
[37:59] can give
[38:00] you amen he can give you unspeakable joy
[38:05] he can give you peace that surpasses all
[38:07] understanding surpasses all human
[38:12] understanding John 14:18 says I will not
[38:15] leave you comfortless I will come to
[38:19] you yet a little while and the world
[38:21] seeth me no more but ye see me because I
[38:26] live ye shall live
[38:28] also ask
[38:31] yourself if we can see him in this hour
[38:35] and we can see the things that we are
[38:37] doing so what does it mean he said I
[38:39] will not leave you
[38:42] comfortless
[38:43] amen yet the world can't see him can the
[38:46] world see what has happened can the
[38:48] world see that the Rapture has begun can
[38:50] the world see the shout went forth can
[38:53] the world see that a mighty Angel come
[38:55] down no
[38:58] so if you can see that he said but the
[39:00] world will not see me but we can see him
[39:03] in the way he manifesting himself how
[39:05] when the two men from him was walking
[39:07] with him he walked with them the entire
[39:09] day but when we came and broke the bread
[39:13] which he's typing the word the way he
[39:15] brought forth the word they began to
[39:17] recognize that this is him amen
[39:21] amen so he said at that day you shall
[39:24] know that I am in my father
[39:28] and Y in me and I
[39:33] personal in
[39:36] you which day in this day amen yes in

[39:46] this day because this is the day the
[39:48] title lead has come down the headstone
[39:51] has come down to come to the body amen
[39:54] The Headstone has come to connect with
[39:56] the body and when the when the headstone
[39:58] has come down now the body knows what he
[40:00] wants done with the word now the body
[40:03] understands the purpose now the body
[40:06] understand amen how to manifest his
[40:11] word because he
[40:14] says he that had my Commandments and
[40:16] keepeth
[40:18] them he it is that loveth
[40:22] me how many people fight against this
[40:24] word how many people persecute this word
[40:28] but you got the word why you keeping the
[40:30] word amen the word told you to love
[40:33] whatever it tells you speaks about from

[41:02] loved of my father and I will love him
[41:05] and will manifest myself to him you see

[45:54] word
[45:55] yes there's so much more to it amen and
[45:59] we pray for more revelation of his
[46:03] word you might say but the prophet
[46:05] preached in the message there's so much
[46:06] in that message you might read the
[46:08] message over and over again but as you
[46:10] keep going you begin to see more things
[46:12] and more things and it becomes fresh to
[46:15] you it becomes in the present time amen

[46:34] to pile the water will try to force
[46:36] itself out that's the way the holy
[46:38] spirit is trying to force itself into
[46:43] you like that like trying to get you to
[46:46] believe it I know that's the truth can
[46:49] you believe that the Holy Ghost once to
[46:51] come to you
[46:53] amen you just have to surrender yourself
[46:55] to him and say Lord fill me up with more
[46:59] and more of you Lord

[47:07] word
[47:07] sparingly this word that he's given us
[47:09] the seven cause meal he's got so much
[47:12] more to give to us there's so much more
[47:15] that he wants to use us with Amen in
[47:17] this hour in this late in this closing
[47:19] hour where we are about to leave this
[47:21] earth when we about to pass the B
[47:25] over
[47:27] it's up to us amen yes to surrender
[47:30] ourselves to it's up to us to come to a
[47:32] realization am as we were fully
[47:35] known don't let the devil make us keep
[47:38] thinking in our flesh don't look at your
[47:40] brother and sister look at them in the
[47:41] flesh look at it as them as a son and
[47:44] daughter of God amen amen look at the
[47:47] Believers that son and daughters of God
[47:49] look at them as a bride of
[47:50] Christ no matter where they are around
[47:53] the world look at them as the bride of
[47:55] Christ as the body of Christ in this
[47:57] hour the one that's taking the word out
[47:59] in this
[48:01] hour amen because they and look at the
[48:03] Ministers of this gospel is our carriers
[48:05] of the Gospel until the Rapture takes
[48:07] place
[48:10] amen amen what a you know what a thing
[48:14] it is to to be in a 54 Ministry this
[48:18] hour because it carrying the gospel to
[48:20] the rapure takes place because there's
[48:22] no other age after this this is the last
[48:25] and last of the there's no other Gentile
[48:28] age after
[48:33] this 1 John 32 says beloved beloved now
[48:38] are we the sons of God yes and he do not
[48:42] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[48:46] that when he shall appear we shall be
[48:49] like
[48:49] him for we shall see him as he is amen
[48:54] what did he live in a glorified body
[48:58] amen and when we shall see him we will
[49:01] be in the glorified body but when he
[49:03] appeared to us in his hour he come in
[49:06] the form of the word amen and we
[49:08] recognize it through the
[49:12] word so all the preaching all the
[49:14] teaching and everything else he had done
[49:16] had failed but when he revealed
[49:19] himself doing the same thing he did
[49:22] before his crucifixion they knew it was
[49:25] him
[49:27] you see so when you
[49:30] see the word being manifested to you you
[49:33] know that is Christ speaking to you yes
[49:36] amen amen but if you if you're drawing
[49:39] from a from a broken
[49:43] system and you're drinking water that
[49:45] was
[49:46] stagnant where all the wiggle tales and
[49:48] so forth came in there then there's
[49:51] something wrong there yes amen but if
[49:54] you're drinking from the Fountain of
[49:55] Life amen
[49:57] Fresh Living
[49:58] Water amen fresh word then you see God
[50:02] identified himself yes you see the
[50:05] characteristics of Christ
[50:08] amen he said it's a total separation we
[50:10] not to go back into the world no more
[50:13] what have anything to do with the world
[50:14] but CLE only unto God Jesus is coming
[50:18] after a bride a woman a church that
[50:21] separated from the things of the world
[50:23] or the cares of the world she separated
[50:25] from the Fashions of the Modern Age that
[50:27] we live in she's separated from the
[50:29] cares and traditions of churches she is
[50:31] separated only to God and God is the
[50:34] word and as husband and wife is one so
[50:36] does the bride and the word become one
[50:39] amen for the word is living through the
[50:41] bride that's our that's a credentials
[50:44] that's a
[50:46] identification amen that's our true
[50:50] identification yes I know now even as I
[50:53] have been fully known amen amen there
[50:56] was a time time in season I was walking
[50:58] in the things of the
[50:59] flesh there was a time in season I
[51:01] thought I was just a normal Christian
[51:03] there was a time in season I was just
[51:05] happy with I believe that it was God
[51:07] sent a prophet there was a time and
[51:09] season I was happy with that and I was
[51:11] satisfied with that there was a time and
[51:13] season I was satisfied that now I
[51:15] believe in proper Church order and
[51:17] Doctrine it was good because why that's
[51:20] how a Christian should be yes it was
[51:22] proper Christian behavior and it was
[51:24] according to the Bible but it wasn't
[51:27] good
[51:28] enough because now I I'm a man I've
[51:31] grown in the word yes so as a man I must
[51:34] speak as a man and as a man I need
[51:37] strong
[51:38] Meats I need a diet for a mature
[51:41] Christian yes I need a diet that will
[51:43] take me and walk into another dimension
[51:46] amen I need to eat food that's going to
[51:49] change his body from this Earthly
[51:52] Dimension to a Heavenly
[51:55] dimension
[51:58] amen but now the word is come in the
[52:01] season to show me who I really am Amen
[52:05] to show me and I'm not just someone who
[52:07] came and just received the word and
[52:09] yes but I'm somebody that is part of the
[52:12] scriptures I'm somebody that is part of
[52:14] redemption amen I'm somebody that walked
[52:18] when God was walking in the Garden of
[52:20] Eden I was walking there with him amen
[52:23] when God said let there be light I was
[52:25] in his thoughts yes when he said let
[52:27] there be light when God was creating the
[52:29] heavens and the Beautiful M the earth
[52:32] and the Beautiful creation the the
[52:33] mountain the Seas the forest and all
[52:35] these beautiful things I was in his
[52:38] thoughts that he created it for me amen
[52:42] and when man is destroying the Earth and
[52:44] God is writing the scriptures through
[52:45] the through His prophets and he said God
[52:48] and he said I to destroy man for
[52:49] destroying the Earth God had me in his
[52:51] thoughts he saw that his Earth is not a
[52:53] foot dwelling place for me when he went
[52:55] on Calvary because of what Satan has
[52:57] done and he took man and put him in a
[53:00] fallen State and he was going to go
[53:02] there when the body was laying in the
[53:06] Tomb and then he went down in his still
[53:08] off the body and when he went to the
[53:09] Souls Lost in prison then went and took
[53:11] the keys from Satan for dead and the
[53:14] grave I was in his thoughts amen amen
[53:18] when he went and defeated Satan and he
[53:19] paid the price I was in his
[53:24] thoughts when the pierced him on his
[53:26] side
[53:27] and he said father it is
[53:29] finished I was in his thoughts
[53:32] am amen so now I know even as I have
[53:36] been fully
[53:37] known because I was in the mind of
[53:40] Christ amen I was in the Eternal
[53:43] thoughts of
[53:44] God and now when I became manifested on
[53:47] the earth I see myself walking out of
[53:49] the scriptures oh thank you Lord I see
[53:52] my brothers and sisters walking out of
[53:54] the scriptures thank you Lord where my
[53:55] brother and sisters is coming walking
[53:57] believing the word rejoicing the word I
[53:59] said that is a son and daughter of God
[54:01] amen amen when I see a 54 Ministry is
[54:04] standing here I said that is Christ
[54:07] speaking to that man amen amen that is
[54:10] Christ speaking to me through his
[54:12] gift I see the gift of God in that
[54:15] person yes I look Beyond the Veil amen
[54:19] than when you say when you see a brother
[54:20] and sister coming to having his faults
[54:22] and failure said Lord Satan you will not
[54:25] put my brother down amen you will not
[54:26] keep my brother down there that is my
[54:29] brother that is my sister they are son
[54:31] and daughter of God they are paid with a
[54:33] price yes because why you are convinced
[54:38] of this message and now you are
[54:40] concerned when you seeing this world
[54:42] dying out in his sin and you seeing
[54:44] Souls that are being lost souls that are
[54:46] going to hell you cannot be quiet you
[54:49] are concerned for them amen because
[54:51] those that are full with the Holy Ghost
[54:53] are crying and sighing for the
[54:54] abomination of the L amen amen what is
[54:57] that the spirit of Christ in
[55:00] you because why everything that Christ
[55:03] was you are amen all that was in God he
[55:07] pour into Christ all that was in Christ
[55:10] he pour into his
[55:13] church he left us in his hour in the
[55:16] most difficult age to do the Greater
[55:20] Works Amen in the most hardest
[55:24] age to do the Greater
[55:27] Works but in it is in this age there
[55:31] will be a people that will not see dead
[55:35] there'll be a people that will literally
[55:38] changed from Mortal to immortality amen
[55:42] there'll be a people that will have a
[55:44] walk that like Enoch walked with God
[55:47] this people will walk with God how do
[55:49] they walk with God when they recognize
[55:51] that they are the temple of God God in
[55:53] them amen Walking with God yes that's
[55:57] how you're walking with God God dwelling
[56:00] in you you better make it comfortable
[56:02] for him because the Holy Spirit takes
[56:05] his flight the M of the life is not
[56:08] right so you want to make it comfortable
[56:10] for the Holy Spirit to dwell in you
[56:12] recognize be conscious of his presence
[56:15] always and God is mindful that the flesh
[56:19] wants to fail but that is why title just
[56:21] come down to make us have dominion say
[56:26] like Adam could say you Mountain go
[56:28] there you tree go there you bird you
[56:30] belong there you tiger you belong there
[56:33] you lion you be away from
[56:37] there you say yourself you start having
[56:40] dominion over your own Earth so you
[56:41] don't belong here you go out Satan you
[56:45] demon that's coming to influency you go
[56:47] out you demon that's coming you get away
[56:49] from
[56:51] me amen you start to have dominion over
[56:54] this flesh first over this Earth
[56:57] amen the sixing element this is the
[56:59] earth you start having dominion
[57:02] over because why you see the
[57:06] entire Plan of Redemption you see the
[57:08] temple of God in your brother you see
[57:11] the temple of God in your sister God
[57:14] dwelling in a many membered body amen
[57:18] you love him
[57:19] amen amen I know now even as I've been
[57:23] fully
[57:25] known man you wouldn't have known this
[57:27] without the revelation of the word
[57:28] without the opening of the word yes
[57:30] without this it was a partial
[57:32] realization yes but now is the hour you
[57:35] come to a perfect realization
[57:38] amen didn't Paul say I prophesy in
[57:42] part amen we know in part we prophesy in
[57:46] part you also had a partial realization
[57:49] but when you come into a perfect
[57:50] realization of who you are then you
[57:54] began to see the responsibility that
[57:56] lays within you the responsibility lays
[57:59] within me because unto whom much is
[58:01] given much is required
[58:11] amen we don't have much time before the
[58:14] Lord will come
[58:15] again we don't have much time amen we
[58:18] can see the signs all around us
[58:23] yes we can see what is happening in
[58:27] Russia Prophet said watch Russia watch
[58:30] Russia watch Russia we can see the
[58:33] condition in America we can see where
[58:35] that's going we can see the whole world
[58:37] turning against
[58:40] Israel when the time will come when
[58:43] everyone will hate Israel persecute
[58:45] Israel no one will stand for her yes and
[58:48] they will start to cry out to
[58:51] him and that is and watch when Israel
[58:54] cries out go back to the book of in
[58:56] Exodus in the first
[58:58] Exodus the Lord said to Moses I heard
[59:01] the
[59:02] Cry of the children of Israel and the
[59:04] task Masters how they cried about the
[59:06] task Masters and so forth and then he
[59:09] remembered he said I remember the
[59:13] Covenant so God won't forget the
[59:16] Covenant when they cry
[59:20] out so can you imagine how late it is in
[59:23] this can you imagine what's left for us
[59:28] that is why there's no other age and no
[59:30] other this is a season where God is
[59:32] showing us things rapidly this is the
[59:35] season where he's bringing us now to our
[59:37] full
[59:38] responsibility if I could put it that
[59:40] way that is why he's showing us who we
[59:41] are that's why he's showing us that we
[59:43] were fully known he's showing us our
[59:46] true
[59:47] potential maybe there was a time we
[59:49] didn't see our true
[59:51] potential and that is why that slave he
[59:54] didn't want to act like every other
[59:55] slave he conducted himself different
[59:58] because he knew his true
[1:00:00] potentials he knew that no matter that
[1:00:03] he kept here maybe a temporary period he
[1:00:05] belongs to a place yes and in the place
[1:00:09] that he belongs to his father was the
[1:00:11] king of the
[1:00:13] tribe and he is the king son that
[1:00:17] identity can never be taken away from
[1:00:18] him amen he was born with an identity
[1:00:22] yes Lord we might be trapped in the SP
[1:00:24] to we might be not known well in society
[1:00:28] we might not be popular in society in
[1:00:30] this world we not be might not be
[1:00:32] popular with the things of this world
[1:00:35] but we know who we truly are amen the
[1:00:37] word has come to show us who we are
[1:00:40] truly are amen that we are son and
[1:00:43] daughter not of a king but of the
[1:00:47] king
[1:00:49] amen and all the and all the things that
[1:00:52] we can see with our spiritual eyes when
[1:00:54] your eyes open you say but are just
[1:00:56] temporal thing people are just feeding
[1:00:58] their lives off for living for 70 years
[1:01:01] 80 years 90 years old 95 people are
[1:01:03] living older now 90 95 98 people are
[1:01:07] living like that now but is death how
[1:01:09] can you compare that to Eternity amen
[1:01:12] people are selling their souls for
[1:01:15] eternity but God has come to show us
[1:01:18] that we already been sealed yes you know
[1:01:21] what that means when you are seal now
[1:01:23] you must go to your destination that
[1:01:26] seal can only break at the destination
[1:01:28] yes it's sealed no one else can break
[1:01:30] that seal because no man sealed you but
[1:01:33] you are sealed with the Holy ghosten if
[1:01:35] the Holy Ghost seals you it's good to go
[1:01:39] it's a good genine product it must go to
[1:01:41] the destination
[1:01:43] amen so we are seal until the day of our
[1:01:48] Redemption we have the down payment amen
[1:01:52] that's the earners of our inheritance
[1:01:53] amen we have the earners of our
[1:01:55] inheritance down payment showing us here
[1:01:57] the proof here the proof of your
[1:01:59] inheritance yes here the proof Esa I've
[1:02:02] given you to half of the kingdom yes
[1:02:05] it's up to you to take it now it's up to
[1:02:07] you to speak now it's up to you to write
[1:02:09] your own
[1:02:13] law amen amen
[1:02:16] amen he's given us the responsibility of
[1:02:19] his work yes he's opened the full
[1:02:21] potential of Heaven to us amen he
[1:02:25] blessed us with all what Paul said he
[1:02:27] blessed us with all spiritual blessing
[1:02:29] the full potential is open to us in this
[1:02:32] hour because he knows that these are a
[1:02:35] responsible people he placed that
[1:02:38] responsibility of his word to us amen
