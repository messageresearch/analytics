amongst the Believers amen amen if you got your BBL this morning we'll turn to the Book of Matthew 12 we read from verse 38-42 and the Lord has been blessing us week after week so we just want to see what he has in store for us this morning amen Matthew 12: 38-42 then the certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil an adulterous generation seeked after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth the men of Neva shall rise in judgment with with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here amen the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here amen amen you may be seated also turn to the Book of Revelation 10:1 and I saw another another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillers of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice when as when a lion roar it and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices amen so we know that we are awakened by the seven amen we've given our true identification we see the mystery of ourselves under the mystery of the Seven Seals amen amen and the Thunders come to reveal those Mysteries amen which were those Thunders were revealed under the Seven Seals and I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders answered and R them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that lived forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets amen so here here the prophet had to come into an age when these Thunders had to be revealed amen so he was preserved for a specific age amen amen we had the the age of reformers yes but in this age all the mystery of God has been revealed Amen in this age the word has been unlocked to us in this age we see ourselves in the scripture we see that hiden mystery because the prophet of God preaches the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he say is Christ you have to see Christ in every page of the book amen and the Mystery hid in Christ was the bride amen now at the time when the prophet is preaching it many wasn't catching it because it wasn't meant for that hour but this is the hour where that mystery is unlocked that everything the Prophet come to do and the the purpose that he came on the earth for was to call out a bride yes and he's preaching a message specifically for a bride amen amen and the voice which are heard from heav spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is opening the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it this is asked now and eat it up and it shall make thy belly butter but it shall be in the mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I heaten it my belly was bter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen so we thank God that God sent us this Prophet because without this Prophet on the earth the word of the Lord must come to a prophet amen when Jesus came he had to present himself to the prophets at the River Jordan because the word of the God must come to the prophets yes so that is the order of God Amen and this Prophet have to receive this word this Mysteries couldn't be unlocked without a prophet on the Earth but a prophet to be on the Earth when the mighty Angel comes down and the reason he being receiving this word is for a specific people oh yes amen amen and he's going to preach this word and it's going to be stored up until the hour amen when the when the time is growing now amen then the fivefold is going to take the same words amen because everything must be in the word everything that a true fivefold preaches must be contained in the message and the fivefold is going to come under the same Spirits because it's the same Holy Ghost they going to be anointed to preach this gospel amen and they're going to now make sense to this words they're going to bring it in the present hour amen amen they're going to take this word that the prophet have preach because the prophet one day he saying to bully Paul did you did you catch that did you catch what I preach he said yes Dad he said buly Paul did you really catch it did you really understand what I preach then the prophet looked at him and he looked at the prophet and said no dad he said not many people caught that because there was a specific all that he was preaching at that time was was locked up for the now time amen thank you Lord yes so you see why the Church the true church or the body needs the five4 ministry yes amen there's a specific role for the five4 ministry to build this body Amen to bring her to Perfection until she is perfected amen amen we speaking a topic this morning the presence of God unrecognized you know the prophet preaches the message the presence pres of God unrecognized and for the subtit subtitle we preaching the Holy Ghost is the sign of his appearing amen the Holy Ghost must be displayed in every age amen but in this age he comes down in his fullness amen yes he says the prophet of God says we know him now as much as our Liber liting senses can let us but one day it will be face to face that is for this age he is coming at the end of this age how many believe we at the End of the Age amen amen so he says partial realization will be made perfect realization am completed realization Hallelujah we have been looking through a glass Darkly but soon it will be face to face amen we have been going from glory to glory amen but soon it will be right in the glory amen and in his glory will shine amen amen this is where the glory the Shina glory of the Lord has come down in his Temple yes because his Temple fly framed together from all parts of the world this body has come now to a place where the Shak Glory has come down to dwell in her and His glory be projected through her amen and he says in his glory will shine we shall be like him Hallelujah wondrously like him Jesus our savior Divine isn't that wonderful we are complete in him amen this is true he would not lie to us about that but one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we will be all swallowed up in life then we realize realization amen what hour we living in he says in 1 Corinthians 13 says for when that which is perfect is that which is in part shall be done away with so all these things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication amen yes amen that couldn't come down until 1963 yes when the mighty Angel comes down amen and he had to come to a prophet yes to bring the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication was that word Vindicated with a pull of fire was that word Vindicated with a cloud amen and with signs and wonders amen then that which is perfect is done away with sorry that which is in part is done away with amen when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things oh lord is my salvation secure do we have eternal security childish things by now you should know that you are passed from Death unto life amen you were born in sin shaped in iniquity your spirit the spirit dropped into a flesh body a body that's going to die but when it's but the je are being a of God you cannot die amen so therefore he gives you his spirits amen through Redemption through the blood of Jesus Christ you have now received his life amen and now when you have received the new birth youart from Death that you pass from this body the death the dead body the by the fall of Man a body that's deaking youart from De unto life amen amen nothing can now you can never be lost if if you that's what the seventh Thunders come to do come to show you your true identification that you're an eternal being being an eternal being how can you be lost if you lost means you're going to be become a temporal being Eternal being can never be lost you might be saying but no I'm in such a condition right now look at my life it's all messed up you are looking at you are not looking at your life the way God looks at it you are looking at the your life the way Satan is playing it on your mind Satan is reminding you of temporal things Satan is reminding you of your temporal failures your temporal falls in the flesh because you are living in a temporal body that's deing in a body that at fals and failures a body that's not perfected but when you come into Christ you are pass from Death unto life so that's why Paul is saying when then that which is part is done away when I was a child I spake as a child now you don't speak as a child anymore you speak now as a mature Son of God because this is the age of adoption amen where you come to maturity you learned everything about Father's Kingdom you learned everything about the way father does things in his kingdom yes amen and now the tror the Holy Ghost amen amen he comes to give a good report that this child can come now in a rightful position this child is now come to maturity they are they can come now and have signing Powers they can speak they can speak through your using your name amen they can speak with your Authority amen and therefore now when you pray you know how to pray amen yes amen when now when you pray you pray with confidence the thing that you asking God for you know that when you speak it must come to pass amen when you speak you know that he hears you when you speak you are speaking with authority you are speaking with confidence that Lord you say I have need of this or my brother has need of that you know that when you speak it it must come to pass amen so let's speak now we speaking about the presence of God unrecognized the prophet of God says the unrecognized presence what could these people be thinking off God is always it's been the way every time he come when Jesus was here the first time he said you whiten and you garnish the walls and the tombs of the prophets and you put them in there see something happens it passes by and God hides it from the eyes of wise and prudent and reveals it to babe s such as will learn now Jesus thanked the father for doing such it goes right by the people and they don't know it he says now in the days of the prophets what happened they did the same thing they didn't recognize them till they had done come Ministry had finished took out of that they elected and then after that they were gone they recognized that they had been a prophet amongst them Jesus he came to the Earth andow with him was the father God I and my father are one my father dwelleth in me it's not me that doeth the works but my father and if I do not the works of my father believe me not amen now if you notice when he came about 11 19th of the world knew that he was uh do not World knew that he was even even on Earth at that time and yet the savior of the world and then they never recognized who he was even the churches or no one else atly knew atly until they had crucified him buried him and Rose on the third day before they ever know who he was it comes in and goes out and people does not recognize it until it's passed and they because it never fits their Theology and it never f the time of the day see what it is they're always living in a glare of another age yeah amen so we find that the same thing is happening today amen as it happened in Jesus day as it happened all the other times when they had the prophets on the earth They Crucified the prophets and when the prophets when the days of the Prophet go past then they garnish the tombs the same thing happened today when Willam brandham was here he he wasn't recognized he wasn't well received when he brought forth the word he was well received under the first two pools but when he came to the opening of the word it was it wasn't well received amen amen and now that the property is of the scene now the we we have a message world and people around the world have recognized this message amen but some people are still living in the glare of another age now he has come to do his part revelation 7 but there's a revelation 10 8-11 amen amen he was preaching specifically for us he was speaking for people in another time and the people that receive this word must go forth amen they must take the book amen they must prophesy again amen but once again when God is now coming amongst them because remember the Holy Ghost is a sign of of his appearing now when the Holy Ghost comes down that means God is here amongst his people when the Holy Ghost is now in a many membered body under John 14:12 says Greater Works than these ye shall do amen now that's the presence of God that's unrecognized in this hour we have many theologians that came and you can interpret the word and show you the things that will happen in the scriptures and show you what happened in the prophet's time but they can't see that the prophet they can't catch the mystery of Christ The Mystery of God the mystery was the bride the mystery was the body amen amen the mystery was the body to be made perfect the mystery was the body for the final work because she becomes the final voice in the final age amen the word was Tau up that when she recognized it and she becomes like him the more she becomes into His Image she'll become that Invincible Army she'll become that super race she'll become that super church amen she'll become the one without spot without blemish amen she'll be the one doing the Greater Works she'll be the one that can forgive sins you say oh my word forgive sins yes yes the Bible said even even she's going to be judging the Earth don't you know that the saint shall judge the Earth on that day on the Judgment Day they going to people going to become there maybe they never Reed the message never receive the word but he said don't you know if you give a glass of water to one of these my little ones you shall surely not lose your reward amen but if you offend one of these my little ones it's better for a mstone to be hang on you right so you see it's going to be a fierce thing on the day of judgment this bride that is in such humility right now she's not recognized in the world she doesn't have the pump of the world she's not recognized in the church world but she's the super Church she's rising up in power right now in this hour amen she's displaying his characteristics she become the continuation of the book of Acts amen but this is not for the public show this is for the specific people amen amen she's going to go out and there might be people that will come to her that people will need healing people will need help and she will be there on display but it's not for the public show it say here 1 Corinthians 13 says when that which is perfect is come okay I read that he says the reason they didn't accept Jesus because they were living in the glare of the law and when Jesus came was not contrary to the law but come to fulfill the law well they couldn't accept him because his message wasn't exactly the way they had it all treated out and it was called all them traditions and he didn't come according to their Traditions he didn't come he didn't keep to their tradition and really he upset it toy it up and done things that was contrary to it in so much that they thought he was breaking up the churches and they couldn't receive him because of his message yes and we all know today that he come exactly in the line of God's prophecy but they didn't know it then and it could happen again and we wouldn't know it I imagine if you would actually appear tonight it would be so contrary to what we've all got figured out up on our charts in our schools and things it would be a very few would recognize what's going on he said it would be that how he come yes amen and now when he's appearing once again amen how is he appearing now through a many member body yes he's appearing through his body amen but they cannot see Beyond the Veil amen people are looking at the veil they are looking at here's normal people on the Earth yes people with faults and failures but they're not looking Beyond the Veil that God is doing a work right now through this body amen amen they're not recognizing the presence of God dwelling in there yes amen such an hour if that can be recognized now can you imagine what a church this would be yes amen can can you imagine what a powerful church this would be when this church recognizes right now I'm talking about the entire body of Christ in such a Unity come and recognize that the presence of God is right now dwelling in her amen that she is the final voice right now that she is the hope to a dying generation amen she is the Hope for cancer she is the Hope for TB she is the Hope for heart disease she is the Hope for diabetes she is the Hope for for for the backslider she is the Hope for the person that the viol sinner right now who everybody gave up on Amen she's the Power House of God she's the M piece of God Amen she is the continuation of the book of Acts amen now Jesus there so scripturally identified by the scriptures and the scribes and the Pharisees of that day could could not recognize him you see where Jesus were identified by the scriptures yes she must be identified with the scriptures she must see herself in the word she must I trust we seeing ourselves in the word amen we're not seeing ourselves as just people that are called Christians coming to church uh marking oursel present in a assembly with the people but we see ourselves in the word amen yes amen and when we see oursel in the word we recognize what we ought to do amen we recognize his instructions for us and how is the instruction is coming is coming through the five4 ministry making us live lives that are not contrary to the word making us become so surrendered to Jesus amen that we separate oursel from the things of the world we don't dress up like the people of the world we don't act like the people of the world world because we recognize that we are a different bunch of people amen yes the world is OD the oddballs to us and we are OD Balls to the world Amen he says the Pharisees of that day couldn't did not recognize him why didn't they why didn't they do it because they had it figured out some other way that's where Jesus told them search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they the testify of me now we come exactly with the scriptures but they figured it out maybe that it would come the Messiah would probably do what Moses did or what Noah did build them ark or something but reason he come the way he did they hadn't figured it out in the scriptures with their traditions did not teach them so the people were so confused they didn't know what was going on he said look at the day we living in what's promised for this day what are we we moved on up the pillar of fire moves and the children of Israel moved with the pillar of fire or they went back to Egypt we've got to move with the word amen amen if we don't move with the word we don't recognize what the holy spirit is doing in his hour that he might as well go back to Egypt you might as well go back to the word cuz God don't remain stagnant the Holy Ghost is always on the move the Holy Ghost is always doing a new thing but the sad part is when the Holy Ghost is doing a new thing and is impacting the and he wants to have an impact people don't the presence of God becomes unrecognized because why is not in the popular theory of the day amen M people have their own mindset of the way God works but if you just surrender to the holy spirit amen because people who are a gene of God have passed from De sin brought Jesus Paid the price to redeem us back amen his Spirit come upon us now we we know that as I said earlier we born in a body that contains death everything about his body is negative everything about his body is going to outside the spirit of God outside the Holy Ghost is going to put you in a problem amen but under the new birth we have passed from Death unto life yes those that are quickened we have the earnest of the change inside of us right now amen we are quickened by this words the Holy Spirit come with a quickening power amen amen yes our body now is turning Heavenly amen amen yes it doesn't it doesn't feel for the things of the Earthly things amen because out of the earth we come just like our God is going to renovate this Earth one day he's renovating this body the Holy Ghost comes with fire in this hour amen amen the Holy Ghost comes with fire and he's renovating this body amen amen he's turning into a new body amen amen he's taking out all the things he's burning up all the sin burning up all changing your nature changing the way you think amen changing the way you you do things amen hallelujah making it a foot dwelling place for the Holy Ghost to dwell in because God is going to come and Rule and reign with the Saints in the Millennium and a new in the Millennium and after the Millennium is going to renovate the Earth and when he renovates the Earth it becomes a foot Dwelling Place For Us amen just like that now you must renovate this Earth amen we worried about that Earth but we start with this Earth amen and when he does that when he turns us Heavenly who's on display it's the glory of God that is on display amen amen is the glory of God displayed because why remember all these years God never had out outside of the prophet of God in this hour God never had a mouthpiece the church was his own mouthpiece but God needed somebody to become its mouthpiece amen and now we got a people that become his mouthpiece amen yes amen because she becomes In His Image yes he says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen don't let anyone say us otherwise because he says is a continuation of the book of Acts that mean there must be Progressive amen yes it must come to great because the Bible say we change from Glory unto glory amen but the Book of Revelation shows out that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lwam formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people amen could get the true revelation of the true church and what she is amen amen he's emphasizing the part on what she is yeah because that's this the hour now Jesus know who he was so the brandom knew who he was amen yes but she needs to know what she is amen what she stands for amen and that she can do the Greater Works oh thank you she will be an invincible Army amen and if they get a true revelation of the true Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discerned and withad the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen he will be as definitely twed today as when Christ WTO stood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan ate Revelation yes but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them so you see the mystery behind this is everything is pointing us to another age Satan will always allow that he's happy he satisfied that you can preach to of another age gone by Satan will be satisfied when you preach about something in the bygone days and say in those days we did this in those days we did that but what Satan hates amen when you recognize what the Holy Ghost is doing in his hour amen when you catch the move of the spirit and when you are in the move of the spirit Satan hates it because he knows if you catch the move of the spirit he will become powerless yes amen amen when you catch the move of the spirit he cannot stand against you amen when you catch the move of the spirit then you recognize God's mandate amen then you recognize what God is doing doing in his hour thank amen he says oh the greatest pleasure I know of is to be is to pray until I can realize that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it I think that ought to be the TR of the church is the presence of the Holy Spirit seeing the god that made the promise standing amongst us feel his presence and see his word and Vindicated it ought to give Faith to make cripples walk blind see de hear dumb speak amen amen this is the hour where you recognize now is not only with you he is in you amen yes amen and when you can recognize that he's in you he's recognized in your brother he's in your sister he's amongst each one of you then you all look at your brother's Falls you w look at your sister's Falls amen you will look at the presence of God living in your brother all you will see is God in them yes Lord amen the accuser of the brother go and accuse you accuse your brother he accuses your sister we are not part of him amen we are part of Christ amen when you see a brother you see a Son of God when you see a sister you see a daughter of God thank you Lord amen you see God in them you see Christ in them that's who you see when I look at you I see Christ you look at me you should be seeing Christ yes amen amen Christ in you the hope of glory am and then what he said you'll do it'll give you Faith to what to make cripples walk to make the blind see to make the deaf here to make the dumb speak why it's giving you that Faith because you recognize that is now Christ in a body amen the body is just the veil but if you're looking within the veil you see Christ Pro rejected through the body you become reflective of Christ amen amen oh only the presence of God can be recognized see what he says here from a little group of the true seed of the word of God of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dog by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin but the Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest now if the Word of Promise has come to us this Mary in this age so who is the word is he himself for what for him to be made manifest so when you receive the word he must be made manifest amen amen so what it is when you see yourself walking out of scripture you become that manifested word in this hour and when you become the manifested word then Satan is all shocked Satan don't know what to do he's left powerless because why you see yourself through the scripture because Satan cannot break scripture amen so I mean sorry Satan cannot change scripture he cannot change God's word God's word is y and amen it's settled amen so when you walk out of the scripture you're walking out of God's word which cannot be changed amen Satan can only pervert but he can't change God's original word amen yes amen so if you're working out the promise of your day there's nothing Satan can do because that is your promise for your day when you see your promise for your day Satan become powerless before you cuz he says he himself acted at a time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that brought her the message but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled at the time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her to the members of the Virgin bride sorry the members of the Virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head see she's come now the through the fivefold ministry bringing the word being built up coming to The Headstone amen amen she comes and she comes under headship amen she comes under Authority she sorry she comes subjection to the Head she recognizes the authority and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our body are subject to our heads but notice the harmony of the father father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 5:19 the armony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it and never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even de for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again he said yeah is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the Bride As the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus say the Lord amen amen so are we waiting for someone else to come and say thus say the Lord or she has thus say the Lord It's the bride amen the many member body she has thus say the Lord amen because she has his potentials yes amen then if she has th say the Lord what she speaks must come to pass because thus say the Lord but she won't speak until it's impressed upon her by his spirit because she recognizes his presence amen she recognizes the the Holy Spirit working within her she doesn't work contrary to the spirit she works with the spirit amen she's in Partnership she's in connection with the Holy Spirit and therefore now when she speak she's speaking under that connection with the spirit amen she has thus say the Lord she performs the command of the word in his name for she has th say the Lord then the word is Quicken by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harest serving his purpose those in the bride do only his Willen no no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saved the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride you see Jesus had to do his part then he brings on the prophet on the scene to do his part yes amen amen the word of the Lord comes to the prophet Revelation 101 coming to Revelation 10:7 then imparting it onto Revelation 10 8-11 amen yes then she must now prophesy she's got her part yes amen amen and when she does her part it must be the continuation of the book of Acts oh yes Lord amen it cannot be a dead Church it cannot be a powerless Church yes because then that that makes God's word a alive cuz he said he'll be a super Church it'll be a super race he'll be an invincible Army she'll do the Greater Works John 14:12 so that if that word has to be come to pass when who change must it be come to pass it must be now because this is the final age right after this the gospel must go back to the Jews amen and you'll find that right now when God is dealing with his bride when he's working amongst her the prayers pres of God will be unrecognized it's only after she leaves then the Jews will be preaching about this bride yes they will preaching there was a bride on the earth amen she come under a messenger oh yes she had a prophet yes she received the word for age amen and she become one with the word hallelujah and she was the one John 14:12 was doing the Greater Works amen amen and great Mighty things were done in a day there's going to be a people that's going to be preaching after she's gone but right now it's time for us to rise up because the Bible says arise and shine the light has come the glory of the Lord is WR upon you amen amen God is living amongst us God is living amongst our brothers our sisters God is living amongst the many membered body around the world right now amen amen each one has a different Ministry but each one is part of the same body and if they got the same holy spirit that rais Jesus from the dead then it's ring the quickening power it's going to Quicken this Mortal body amen we all waiting for the Holy Spirit to Quicken this Mortal body but right now the holy spirit is quickening the spiritual body amen the holy spirit is already quickening with the quickening power he quickened his body she's not laying dant anymore it's her time to raise up the church is dead the church world is dead the people are starving the people don't have hope yes the people are eating from a garbage can right amen they're trying to impress the world they're trying to bring people in the church but bringing the world in the church trying to attract them with the world but this bride will not do that amen yes this bride has an unadulterated word she wouldn't compromise with the word we don't bring the world in the church to attract Sinners amen because why it's the anointing that will break the Yoke of bondage this this bride is Anointed with the anointed word for the age and it's the anointing that will break every yoke of bondage it's the anointing that will break the Yoke of bondage the thing that sat is Bing the people would when the when the true bride is speaking amen she will speak with authority and B The Works of the enemy yes Lord thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen amen thank you Lord she don't need you can't come if you want to they want to bring the world bring the people in and attract them with the things of the world to try and save them that won't happen the Catholic Church tried that and it failed do you know that then the Catholic Church says let us bring some of our Pagan beliefs some of our pagan traditions in maybe our Pagan Brothers will be saved for 2,000 years none of them got saved they went more into the world they went more into paganism you cannot bring the world into the church amen you take the church you take the world out of the church by washing them with the Waters of the world Amen so he says he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministries so now his Works he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time 2024 for this specific time don't look at this as something gone by he left this time he left this work for this bride a special work for her a quick short work for this specific time amen amen and he's working with us from from the time we received recognize what he's doing amongst us amen yes he said if you only could do that tonight people if we could only realize that he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose I want you to put in this now amen he's appearing to us for one purpose yes that's to realize our desire that we have in him to us but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence now he's going answer and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest amen amen not the promised word of Moses age or any of the other ages the promise of the word for this age amen amen so that's how you recognize his presence what he promised he said there will be a super Church there will be a super race there'll be an invincible Army she'll there'll be a church that will be a continuation of the book of Acts that's the promise for this time amen just read quote number n the same as it is today people will take the real gospel where the Holy Ghost is coming in and the power and glory of God releasing sinners from sin and making them free and baptize them in the Holy Ghost and Healing The Sick and showing signs and wonders and people will walk away say ha now you know what my church believes that's nonsense you are forfeiting you are selling your birth rights another Esau is that same as it is today people will take the real gospel with sorry so he says you see what happens people can't when when when God is doing something in the now and people want to Forfeit these blessings amen because why people are scared to take what he's giving us in because it's a responsibility amen yes to receive this word for this hour to recognize to to to be in connection what the holy spirit is doing in this hour there is a responsibility and the responsibility is a separation amen is a call for a total separation from all unbelief from worldly things from worldly desires and L surrendering oursel to Christ it takes a consecration because now you are recognizing who you are and if you're recognizing who you are and what your mandate is because you have a mandate to fulfill you have a purpose that you have put here in this hour like esta said have I been say have I been sa preserved for such a time as this for the preservation of life yeah have you been kept for such a time like this amen when the world is in a Sodom condition yes Lord the church world have compromised with Sodom they brought Sodom in the church and the world is s in such a Sodom condition man is afraid to speak the truth yeah are you going to be a people that will stand with the truth are you going to be a church that will stand with the word and say no amen that's not what the Bible says the B does not profess these things this is how the Bible say a woman should dress up a woman shouldn't be preaching a woman should know a position yes this is what the Bible say about a man should do how a man should treat his family how the man is now the provider of his home amen can you stand up with that word and say no this is what the word says yes there will be a people because he said so amen he prophet ided and God's word must come to pass God is not a man that he should lie amen and when God is doing all these things look at the things that God is doing taking the church to higher Heights yes amen but it's a time where the presence of God being unrecognized he don't be recognized it's not popular yes there'll also be Pharisees and Sadducees who kept the law who kept the message but they can't recognize what God is doing in the now amen yes they was faithful to the word kept it to the letter kept the message to the letter kept Church order and Doctrine to the letter but the Bible says the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life amen because why they fail to recognize the move of the Holy Spirit but the holy Spirit every time the presence of God is unrecognized the Holy Ghost is the sign of his appearing amen and are you recognize the Holy Ghost goes back to his word the Holy Ghost brings quickening power the Holy Ghost brings life to the word the Holy Ghost bring a manifestation of the word amen the Holy Ghost don't take you to a day gone by the Holy Ghost is on the move you find the children of Israel when the pull of fire move they move they have to move they might have the C they might be comfortable but when the Holy when the when the P of fire moves they move that's the Holy Ghost amen so when the Holy Ghost moves we move amen and now we have to recognize the move of the spirit where the move of the spirit is now the move of the spirit is in you and I is in your brother is in your sister the move of the spirit is in a many membered body because why why there must be a Greater Works there's a crying out right now right now you got families you got neighbors you got work colleagues you got schoolmates College friends right now in distress yeah what hope do they have they're going to they can't rely on the governments they can't rely on the on their families they can't r on their wealth the wealth will fail them yes they can't on the hell the hell can fail him overnight yes what do they have to rely on Amen but you and I have the answer oh yes Lord Jesus is the answer for the world today amen and where is Jesus Jesus is in you and I amen amen if they see if the only way they can see Jesus is you it's through you so if I can put it this way you are the answer to the world today that's what I'm trying to tell you you are the answer to this dying generation amen you are the solution to the problems amen but look Beyond the Veil today don't look at your brother and your sister through the Earthly eyes look at them through God's word look at them through the promise of God's word look at your husband look at your wife and see what the scripture says about them hey man that they are sons and daughters of God the Holy Ghost is come down in this day amen a mighty Angel come down you know it's amazing coming to the uh we having a special service on Wednesday you know when when I just be brother adri and I just started preaching it was round about that time when all the critics started coming about the cloud picking on the cloud R about the time we started preaching and I remember we were in a Minister's meeting and people and the ministers were talking about another Minister that were giving his version of the cloud and were coming out and they they were trying to like you know white wash it the agent said no I got the evidence I said if someone speak somebody is speaking directly about against the cloud listen to this and that's when we took our stand and he said when the prophet preaches the cloud he takes you to scripture and if something is in scripture Satan can't come against it that's right so just like that if we are in scripture then our part can't be taken out you can't add to this word you can't take out from this word we got to fulfill our paths you've got to recognize who you are in the word you got to recognize that you are the one stepping out of the word right now you become the manifested word in his hour so when someone comes against the word we got to take a stand no matter who it is amen we are not yet to compromise with the word we're not yet to win the favor of man yes amen we are here to win the favor of God we are here because we are part of God we can we cannot be separated from God and he is the word and we cannot be separated from the word so we are here to stand with his word amen no matter what we can lose friends we can lose Fellowship it doesn't matter we stay with the word amen and when we recognize what God is doing in this hour what his word said will happen in this hour and we see it we stay with the words amen no matter what the critics the critics will come the critic will say why you laughing so much on the Holy Ghost in This Hour why you laughing on the on the things because God is amongst us yeah amen we're not looking at a day gone by we recognize that the prophet was there for a specific purpose storing up a food for a specific people and I can say I am one of them amen you can say you are one of them amen that the word was stored up for us hallelujah will will become the Fulfillment of the words that we are no longer in a partial realization we are in a perfect realization hallah amen recognizing what is doing what God is doing in this hour recognizing the move of the spirit in this hour recognizing the Holy Ghost working in me working in you amen amen we are become his mouthpiece we want to do the works he wants to do if we don't surrender ourselves to him what is's going going to use in his hour because he selected us for his hour amen amen he's relying upon you and me right amen I mean that God has always relied upon man God has always used man yes he had to separate His prophets you know you know the stories of the Prophet when the prophet would listen to his mother-in-law and wouldn't go out what happened to him he had to face the consequences for that when he had to come to Der South Africa and he listened to the ministers yet he didn't want to listen to them because the Holy Spirit wanted him to come to Duran South Africa but when he went to Cape Town and Johannesburg what the what happened to him so just like that we got to stay with what God once we got to stay with his word amen it might not be popular it might not be in the best interest of everybody but let it be in the best interest of God Amen he said that's the reason they didn't accept Jesus because they were living in the glare of the law and when Jesus came was not contrary to the law but come to fulfill the law well they couldn't accept him because his message wasn't exactly the way they all had Creed it out and it was called then Traditions he didn't come according to the Traditions he didn't come didn't keep their tradition and really it accept it and toy it up and done things that was contrary to in so much that they thought he was breaking up the churches and they couldn't receive him because of his message and we all know today that he come exactly in the line of God's prophecy but they didn't know it then and he said that it could happen again we wouldn't know it and we wouldn't know wouldn't know H I imagine if we he would actually appear tonight it would be so contrary to what we all got figured up that's what I read right so if you had to people have got God they think they got God figured out but God is not like that God is a spirit amen and a spirit moving and dwelling in his body in bodies the 200 million demons on the Earth right now let loose God permitted them to be let loose but those Spirits those demons cannot do anything without working with bodies people in power people residents people in medicine bringing all these viruses and so forth all these scientists and so forth who you think is influencing them amen who you think is influencing those bodies those 200 million demons in the midst of wars and so forth those 200 million demons all those people that are doing evil on the Earth all those people that bring in the Sodom condition those are demons yes amen Sodom was destroyed but Spirits don't die the people in Sodom died but those demon Spirits were laying for a time like this it was laying there but now they on the earth once again influence you think man just decided today I want to sin no they are influenced by evil power that is why in the time of the Millennium there there will be other people there living for the Thousand Years yet we'll be in within the they won't be with us but there will be peace because Satan will be bound amen now if Satan is bound they can't do nothing but little the minut is let loose then all the evil that within them will come forth so just like that these people were here they were predestinated for those purposes because there wasn't it wasn't part of God but now those 200 million demons are using those bodies now just like that God is God is in us the holy spirit in US using us for his purpose amen fulfilling his word his word must be fulfilled God's word must come to pass every part of God's word must come to pass amen yes just like that every promise in God's word belongs to you yes if you believe by faith healing belongs to you then you receive healing amen yes you believe by faith he said do not take thought of what food you're going to eat what clothes you're going to wear your father knows the things that you have need of you know that is Jehovah J your provider then he'll provide the thing that you have need of Amen yes amen but the reason you receive it not because you ask not and when you ask you ask without believing oh thank you but if you believe and then you ask thank you Lord by faith thank you Lord that whatever you ask you shall receive it yes amen you want a better job you ask by faith ask your father that's right because jobs come from your father amen jobs don't come by contact the people of the world get jobs with context and bribery and Corruption yeah you get jobs through your father

yes that's God knows the things that his children have made of the prophet of God said God wants us to have a house his children to have a car he wants to put a smile on his children's face yes amen amen he knows the things that we have need of that's right thank you Lord that's our father amen but you got to recognize where he is right now living amongst you amen recognize your brother and sister for that amen don't look at the false yeah because we receive the father come and says we're living in hour of walking in perfect love if you're living in perfect love I mean God is love everything about him is love and if God is love we must be love amen but not love like the people of the world that's the temporal love we talking about an unconditional love amen and aapo love amen it's different from the world the love of God is different when God looks at us God don't love us because we did something for him God loves us unconditionally amen the things that we do for God is an appreciation the prophet said for the things that he did for us oh thank you he loved us with an unconditional love thank you Lord he saw he didn't look he looked at our because remember we you already born in we already come in the sinful condition he looked beyond that amen he said these are my children he died for us he purchased us with his blood don't let the devil hold you bondage the
