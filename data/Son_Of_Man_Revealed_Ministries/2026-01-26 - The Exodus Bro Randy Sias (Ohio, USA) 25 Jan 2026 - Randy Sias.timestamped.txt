[0:00] Everyone's
[0:01] well.
[0:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And rejoicing in the Lord.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Rejoice in the Lord
[0:07] always."
[0:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; And again, I say rejoice.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. The human heart was made to be
[0:12] happy.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; The human heart was made to rejoice.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; And then when our father reveals himself
[0:18] to us,
[0:19] &gt;&gt; he reveals our true identity, our
[0:21] purpose. Amen. What we are called for in
[0:23] this life.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he reveals our earthly
[0:27] journey.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God's provided way in
[0:31] this time and hour is for us to serve
[0:33] him. Amen. Not in a Lutheran age, Wesian
[0:36] age, a Pentecostal age,
[0:38] &gt;&gt; but in the present time and season, the
[0:41] message of the hour. Amen. Where he has
[0:43] come to turn our hearts back to the
[0:45] faith of the original Pentecostal
[0:47] fathers.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Now remember the faith, we must have
[0:50] that same faith.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All the preaching, all the
[0:53] teaching and everything, if it doesn't
[0:55] produce the life doesn't produce the
[0:57] faith, then something is missing.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; If we don't see ourselves walking like
[1:03] the disciples walked.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost
[1:07] &gt;&gt; in action.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet says the Holy Ghost is the
[1:10] action in us.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; So even as we examine our lives, see if
[1:14] we are sensitive to that still small
[1:16] voice and if we can hear the spirit
[1:18] speak to us and lead us and guide us. He
[1:20] was sent to lead us. The prophet says, I
[1:23] wonder why they ever got away from the
[1:25] Holy Ghost which was sent to lead and
[1:27] guide the church.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, but they set up other
[1:31] ministers and they set up programs and
[1:33] they set up so many things that will
[1:35] take the place of the Holy Ghost.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you know the prophet
[1:39] finally tells us that the dynamics of
[1:42] this church will be a refilling of the
[1:44] Holy Ghost.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; A refilling. So even this morning, even
[1:48] as you come with your hearts, amen, in
[1:51] humbleness before the Lord, just empty
[1:54] out every thought.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; And right now, just say, "Lord, I have
[1:56] this expectation that you're going to
[1:58] speak to me."
[1:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God meets expectation.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; You know, there were many times Jesus
[2:06] and his disciples were walking along.
[2:09] Can you imagine blind Bartameus,
[2:13] he heard, the Bible says he heard the
[2:14] noise. Amen. And he asked them, "What is
[2:18] this noise?"
[2:20] &gt;&gt; He could have chose to remain silent.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; But when he understood that it was Jesus
[2:25] passing by,
[2:27] &gt;&gt; he said, "Son of David," he cried out.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; Now, if you if you're paying attention
[2:33] there, he said, "What is his noise?" So,
[2:34] there's a lot of noise.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet says, "Wherever
[2:37] Jesus is, there's a lot of noise."
[2:39] &gt;&gt; So, in the midst of the noise,
[2:40] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Barame's voice was louder than all of
[2:43] them that it caught the ears of Jesus.
[2:45] Amen. Oh yes.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; So in the midst of all the noise this
[2:48] morning, can you cry out? He is passing
[2:51] by this morning.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; You touch, reach out and touch him.
[2:54] Amen. So we are so blessed and
[2:56] privileged to have our pastor uh he's no
[2:59] no longer a pastor, former pastor Randy
[3:02] Sas. Am I saying that correctly?
[3:05] &gt;&gt; Saias. Amen. Let's give our dear pastor
[3:07] a hand. Welcome. [applause]
[3:10] Amen. I believe pastor is 75.
[3:15] 75 years old and still on the mission
[3:18] field.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's formerly a pastor of a church
[3:21] in Ohio in the USA. Not Ayo,
[3:25] Ohio. [clears throat]
[3:26] Ohio, USA. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; And uh his [clears throat] dad was a
[3:32] former pastor there. He went on to the
[3:34] mission field. Amen. Then he was the
[3:36] pastor of the church and now he's gone
[3:38] onto the mission field. Now the prophet
[3:40] says a missionary is an apostle.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't know why they stopped
[3:45] using the name apostle, but they call
[3:47] themselves missionary. But if you're
[3:49] looking for his gifting or his
[3:51] identification in the scripture, he's an
[3:53] apostle."
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'd like to welcome our dear
[3:56] apostle this morning. I know he doesn't
[3:58] like the title or the name, but that is
[4:01] a scriptural reference to it. Praise the
[4:03] Lord. So, amen. He's been a blessing in
[4:06] the services that he's had thus far.
[4:08] I'll leave the rest of the introduction
[4:09] for our dear brother to come and
[4:11] introduce himself. and as the spirit
[4:13] leads. Amen. So, just want to welcome
[4:15] our dear sisters visiting with us this
[4:17] morning. Pray that you be blessed in the
[4:18] house of the Lord. Even our brother Tim
[4:19] at the back there. Amen. God will bless
[4:21] you and I pray you'll be blessed. How
[4:23] many of you have come at expectation?
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God's going to meet that
[4:27] expectation.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; If we come and say, "Lord, I refuse to
[4:30] leave here unless you bless me, unless
[4:32] you speak to me.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; We come with persistence.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; He will hear us."
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so dear pastor, we give you a
[4:38] liberty this morning to speak even as
[4:40] the spirit gives utterance. Let's stand
[4:42] together and sing. There's room at the
[4:43] cross, room at the cross for you. Though
[4:46] millions have come, there is still room
[4:48] for one
[4:50] &gt;&gt; and there's room at the cross for you.
[4:53] There's room
[4:55] at the cross [music]
[4:58] for [singing] you. Amen.
[5:03] [music]
[5:05] There's [singing] room
[5:07] at [music] the cross
[5:10] for [singing]
[5:11] you.

[5:44] for [singing and music] you.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[5:52] at the cross
[5:55] [music and singing] for you.
[6:00] And no

[7:09] &gt;&gt; Dear gracious heavenly father.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; As we come to you in the precious name
[7:18] of Jesus Christ.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, [music]
[7:23] &gt;&gt; we love that name, Lord. Yes.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; I've experienced, Father, being in a
[7:29] public place and walking around and hear
[7:33] somebody say the name of Jesus and my
[7:36] heart jumps.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; And I think he who is used that
[7:40] wonderful.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.

[7:46] &gt;&gt; Because that name means so
[7:48] [clears throat] very much to us.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] I'm thankful to be able to
[7:54] be here, Lord Jesus,
[7:56] &gt;&gt; with another [music] part of the family
[7:58] of God. A part of the family I have
[8:00] never met before.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; But Lord, we are all of one family.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; And you are our father.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; We all have one message to come and
[8:13] follow after your word.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; I pray that you will bless us this
[8:17] evening.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; May you use your servant, Lord, and
[8:21] bring bread of life. Lord, I could do
[8:23] nothing without you.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; I've seen you walk with me, Lord, and
[8:27] guide me through the years. And I'm
[8:30] asking once again that you will stand
[8:32] with [music] me, Lord.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; This poor servant, Lord, that bows his
[8:36] head, Lord, humbly before you.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Knowing, Lord Jesus, that you are our
[8:41] strength, our breath, you are our life,
[8:45] you are wisdom, Lord. You are everything
[8:47] to us. Amen.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; So now we commit this service into your
[8:51] hands. Continue to bless each one that
[8:54] is here. In Jesus name we pray.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord Jesus.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Let's open our
[9:03] [clears throat] our Bibles to uh Exodus
[9:06] 12 if you would. Thank you physicians.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; We love the Lord very much with all of
[9:16] our hearts. since uh I've been serving
[9:18] the Lord for
[9:20] at least about 55 years now
[9:23] &gt;&gt; and uh back in 1971
[9:29] uh I dedicated my life to the Lord. I
[9:31] was 21 years old and uh received the
[9:35] baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; From my childhood, I was looking for
[9:40] something. I knew I needed it and I was
[9:43] at the altar many times praying. But
[9:46] this particular time I had just come
[9:48] back uh from Vietnam. I had been in the
[9:51] military. I had come back from Vietnam
[9:53] and there's some meetings.
[9:56] And uh when I went into those meetings,
[9:58] the power of God come in so strong. And
[10:00] I [clears throat] came in with a desire
[10:02] that I have to have God.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; And when I walked out of the meetings, I
[10:07] was walking around for four months
[10:09] saying, "What is different? Something
[10:11] has happened to me." And I realized that
[10:14] Lord, the Lord come into my heart. It
[10:16] changed me and I had such a hunger and a
[10:19] thirst to serve God. And that has never
[10:22] left me till this.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; If any of you today do not have the
[10:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost, you think you
[10:29] have it. It's not what you think.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; When you receive the baptism of the Holy
[10:34] Ghost, there's a change. It comes in
[10:36] your heart.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; And you know that change is there.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And someone would say to you,
[10:43] "Well, I don't believe that you have it.
[10:45] I don't believe you have the spirit of
[10:46] God."
[10:47] &gt;&gt; I know. I could say you weren't there.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; You don't know what I was. You don't
[10:52] know how God changed.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; I know what happened to me.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have to believe it because it
[10:59] wasn't for you. It was for me.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that needs to know whether
[11:04] it is correct or not.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh
[11:09] [clears throat] we'll read this portion
[11:10] of scripture and we'll have you to be
[11:12] seated. In Exodus 12, we're going to
[11:16] read verses 36- 38.
[11:21] And the Lord gave the people favor in
[11:23] the sight of the Egyptians, so that they
[11:26] lent unto them such things as they
[11:29] required. and they spoiled the
[11:32] Egyptians, which means they took of the
[11:34] things that they had the Egyptians had
[11:36] to be able to go on their journey. And
[11:39] the children of Israel journeyed from
[11:41] Ramsy's to uh Sukon and uh about 600,000
[11:47] on on foot that were men besides
[11:51] children and a mix see it didn't didn't
[11:54] me didn't mention the women in other
[11:56] words there's children and women that is
[11:58] in there which comes out actually we
[12:00] understand it was about 2 million people
[12:02] that came out
[12:04] &gt;&gt; yes
[12:04] &gt;&gt; and it says here in verse 38 and a mixed
[12:07] multitude went up also again and flocks
[12:11] and herds even uh very much cattle.
[12:15] Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh let's
[12:17] [clears throat] also look over into
[12:19] Numbers if you would. One verse of
[12:20] scripture.
[12:26] Numbers
[12:33] and that will be uh chapter 11. I'm
[12:37] sorry.
[12:43] one verse here in verse number four.
[12:46] Numbers 11:4.
[12:54] And the mixed multitude that was among
[12:56] them fell to fell to lusting. And the
[13:00] children of Israel also wept again and
[13:04] said, "Who shall give us flesh to eat?"
[13:07] May the Lord bless his word. You may be
[13:09] seated.
[13:15] Praise the Lord. [clears throat]
[13:18] We're going to title this today simply
[13:22] uh the uh the Exodus.
[13:26] And uh because everything we're going to
[13:28] be speaking about uh it's around the
[13:32] thoughts of the Exodus.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:35] And as I said uh had speaking last night
[13:40] I said uh that God always has a purpose
[13:43] in what he does.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; And uh the difficulty is that many times
[13:48] people do not understand the purpose.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; When they came out of Egypt they were
[13:55] very very happy people when they came
[13:58] out. [clears throat]
[14:01] uh because they are living leaving
[14:02] living a very difficult life.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Uh just a small quote here from uh 1964
[14:10] proving his word. Brother Ben says,
[14:12] "Yes, Joseph had much to go through
[14:16] uh to go down into Egypt, but God
[14:19] brought him out just exactly like he
[14:22] said. A very beautiful pipe of today. If
[14:26] we had time to go into it, I believe we
[14:30] have before uh here at the tabernacle
[14:33] went through uh I've gone through those
[14:35] thoughts. But God kept his word because
[14:39] uh they had to stay stay there in Egypt.
[14:43] It was hard for those Hebrew children
[14:46] down there in Egyptian bond Egypt which
[14:50] had been blessed and given the fruit of
[14:53] the land. the best place go to find out
[14:58] that they had to become slaves and those
[15:01] mothers to have to uh give into the h
[15:04] hands of the the Egyptian soldiers uh
[15:07] the fruit of the womb. In other words,
[15:09] that the the women, the Jewish women had
[15:13] to give up their children to the
[15:15] Egyptians that they would become
[15:16] soldiers, the fruit of the womb of their
[15:19] darling children baby and see him stand
[15:23] there, take a big knife and uh just cut
[15:27] it open and throw it over uh onto the
[15:30] ground, feed it to the the uh the
[15:32] gators, the crocodiles. Now it was hard
[15:36] thing to them to have to go through
[15:39] that.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. So it was they went from being a a
[15:43] Jewish people but they ended up going
[15:47] down into Egypt and it become to be a
[15:50] very hard life
[15:52] &gt;&gt; and very difficult and many times in
[15:55] pastoring I pastored for 47 years and
[15:58] there many have asked me well why did
[16:01] you resign and it was very simple is the
[16:04] Lord spoke to me and told me to resign.
[16:06] Yes,
[16:07] &gt;&gt; I um it was asked me, you know, the
[16:10] giving thoughts about possibly resigning
[16:13] and I thought I had responded with the
[16:15] words that I will never resign until the
[16:18] Holy Spirit speaks to me. And uh I've
[16:22] tried to resign before and the Lord
[16:24] would not let me. And uh I I knew that
[16:28] if I tried to do it again, he the Lord's
[16:31] going to stop me. So, he's going to have
[16:33] to speak to me directly.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Well, the very next night something
[16:38] happened and took place and confirmed
[16:41] that was actually the will of God and I
[16:44] just couldn't believe that I am actually
[16:47] supposed to resign
[16:49] really. It was a shock to me and uh so
[16:55] therefore in the next uh next while
[16:58] while I'm not going to give you all the
[17:00] details but um uh it took a while it was
[17:03] a little over a year before I actually
[17:06] resigned because when God tells you to
[17:08] do something there is a time
[17:10] &gt;&gt; to do it. [clears throat]
[17:12] &gt;&gt; There is the will of God and then
[17:14] there's a time for the will of God.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible tells us that the dead
[17:18] in Christ will rise first and we who
[17:20] remain shall be changed. But there's a
[17:22] time for that to take place.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; And so we're waiting on the on the the
[17:28] timing of of God.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; And so that uh as I was looking to the
[17:34] Lord, it looked it came to be uh a
[17:37] little over a year and it came to
[17:40] January 1st, 2023 is when I resigned.
[17:43] Then after that I was praying to the
[17:46] Lord Lord what shall I do? I've resigned
[17:49] my position. I've taken all the
[17:51] authority and given it over to the uh uh
[17:55] uh present pastor now uh which is uh
[17:59] accepted by 100% of the people and uh he
[18:04] has the church and what am I supposed to
[18:06] do? What do I do? Well, the Lord sent
[18:08] somebody from another state and came and
[18:11] preached in our area. I went to that
[18:13] meeting and the Lord told me exactly
[18:15] right there in that message. Even the
[18:17] title of the message, I was wrestling
[18:20] with the will of God. Lord, what do I
[18:22] do? What do I do? And he comes to the
[18:24] pulpit and he says, the title of the
[18:26] message tonight is finding the will of
[18:28] God.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; And so, I've had those things happen.
[18:35] And I have other testimonies where the
[18:38] Lord has come directly and spoken to me.
[18:40] And I find that is very important that
[18:43] we keep our eyes on the Lord regardless
[18:46] of what the circumstance.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; God always has a plan. When things are
[18:53] in its worst
[18:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the when the when the
[18:59] time is very very dark
[19:04] &gt;&gt; and you think Satan has come and taken
[19:07] completely control, it's all in the plan
[19:10] of God.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Satan can do nothing but follow the
[19:17] blueprint of God.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Anything he does falls right in line
[19:24] with the plan of God.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan will go and do something and
[19:28] God has said, "Yep, I've been waiting
[19:30] for that.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; I knew you were going to do this."
[19:34] &gt;&gt; And so when we begin to learn that we
[19:36] are pre uh children of the king and that
[19:40] we are walking with him and he loves us
[19:42] very much.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; So now it gives us a courage that when
[19:46] we get very sick,
[19:48] &gt;&gt; I've had some uh uh physical conditions
[19:51] and they were had been very bad for me.
[19:54] But in the midst of it all, I said, "No,
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, I know you called me to walk with
[20:00] you."
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; You told me in your word that you have
[20:03] healed me.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; This thing has to go. The body
[20:07] [applause] has to obey.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; It has to obey because you have said so.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; The devil, you have called me to preach
[20:17] the gospel and I can't preach the gospel
[20:19] in this condition. So therefore,
[20:21] something has to change. Amen.
[20:24] Wonderful. [applause]
[20:24] &gt;&gt; I don't care about the pain. I don't
[20:26] care about the symptoms. I don't care
[20:28] about anything. I know that God is going
[20:31] to bring a change. I'm standing here.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; That change. Amen.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make any difference what the
[20:40] circumstance.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It was uh uh sometime
[20:45] in about last July. Uh, I was planning
[20:49] to go to the Congo
[20:51] and uh uh the the Congolese embassy had
[20:57] my passport and had not issued my visa
[21:00] and I only had a a few days before like
[21:04] about uh
[21:06] just about 7 to 10 days before I'm
[21:09] leaving and uh I they have not even
[21:13] informed me. They've had it for a couple
[21:15] of months and they have not even
[21:17] informed me of what the status of my
[21:19] passport is. So I told my wife, I said,
[21:22] I'm going to have to go to Washington,
[21:24] Washington DC, which is uh it's a 7-hour
[21:27] drive for me. And uh I'm going to have
[21:30] to go to Washington tomorrow. And she
[21:32] says, "Washington?" I says, "Yes." I
[21:34] says, "I have to get that passport and
[21:36] that visa." I said, "What am I going to
[21:38] do?" And I was all nervous about it. And
[21:41] I'm thinking, "What am I going to do?
[21:42] I've already paid for the tickets and
[21:44] I'm going to lose the money for the
[21:45] tickets and and what if they don't give
[21:47] me the passport? What if I don't have
[21:48] the visa? What if they my brain is just
[21:50] running away?
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; And I just stopped and I just uh pulled
[21:55] back and I said, "No, I don't care what
[21:58] the situation is. God has always taken
[22:01] care of everything."
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; He's always taking care of everything.
[22:07] And I said, "So somehow it'll work out,
[22:10] but that doesn't stop the brain."
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[22:13] &gt;&gt; the brain is still going on and thinking
[22:15] and thinking.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; And why I'm giving you just a little bit
[22:19] a little bit of my testimony is to
[22:21] encourage you regardless of what you're
[22:24] going through.
[22:26] God is an omnipotent God.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; He He care if he cares for the sparrows,
[22:32] he cares for you.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; So, never think that he's very far away.
[22:37] He knows everything that you're going
[22:40] through.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Amen.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, also along with going on
[22:44] that trip, I knew that I was going to
[22:46] have some expenses and I didn't have the
[22:49] money for those expenses. And, uh, so I
[22:53] I I here at this particular time, I am
[22:56] very concerned about this passport. So,
[23:00] I know that in Washington there's a
[23:02] church that is there. I thought, well, I
[23:04] haven't seen the pastor in a long time.
[23:06] I'm going to go to church there that
[23:07] night and visit the pastor and then I'm
[23:09] going to go and take care of that
[23:10] business about the passport. So, I do
[23:13] that and uh I go to the uh uh church
[23:17] there and have fellowship with the
[23:19] pastor and the people there. It was a
[23:21] wonderful time with the Lord. And I'm
[23:23] walking out and uh we pastor and I were
[23:25] the last ones. We were talking so much
[23:27] and I'm about to walk out the door and
[23:30] uh the pastor says, "Brother, here
[23:31] here's something for your missionary
[23:33] trip." And he gives me $2,000. You don't
[23:36] know what it is, so I'll tell you how
[23:37] much it was.
[23:40] Uh he gave me $2,000. I said, "Brother,"
[23:42] he said, "No, no, no, no, no. You take
[23:44] this. You take this for the for the work
[23:46] of God." And uh I did not expect that.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking for that.
[23:54] I I had no idea that this was going to
[23:57] happen, but I needed that.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; You understand what's happening?
[24:04] &gt;&gt; God arranged it. I had to go for that
[24:06] passport, but there was somebody else
[24:08] who's going to give a donation to help
[24:10] me on the trip. But everything was just
[24:12] working working out.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I when I got there's so
[24:18] many details and I'm going to make it
[24:20] short because we have other things we
[24:22] want to talk about.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; But as I'm as I'm I'm now I actually I
[24:26] was leave left home and I was about
[24:28] maybe about halfway to Washington and uh
[24:31] No, no, no, no. I was just leaving my
[24:33] home and I was headed to Washington. I'm
[24:36] determined I'm going to make this trip
[24:38] and I get a a phone call from
[24:40] Washington.
[24:42] A phone call from No, no, no.
[24:45] Stop think.
[24:48] You ever have that problem?
[24:50] [laughter]
[24:53] Your brain just goes off.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; No. I got a phone call from the Congo,
[24:59] [clears throat] Democratic Republic of
[25:00] Congo, and the brother in the Congo
[25:03] says, "I hear you got trouble with your
[25:05] visa."
[25:07] Uh, yes. He says, "I'm going to make a
[25:09] phone call for you."
[25:11] And he says, "People are going to be
[25:13] calling you to get that thing
[25:14] straightened around." Really?
[25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; You understand? I'm [laughter] just
[25:19] leaving my home.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; He doesn't know I'm on my way. But he
[25:23] calls me and says, "I hear you have
[25:25] trouble getting your visa." I said,
[25:26] "Yes, I do."
[25:29] &gt;&gt; And so when I did go to the uh the
[25:32] embassy, they had to sit there for a
[25:35] little while, but it was all
[25:36] straightened around. All in all, I'm on
[25:39] my way back home. I got another $2,000
[25:41] for the trip. Everything is paid for,
[25:44] taken care of, because when I got to the
[25:46] Congo, I had a $2,000 uh to $2,400 bill
[25:51] that needed to be paid for different
[25:53] experience expenses that were there
[25:55] &gt;&gt; and so on. But the Lord took care of all
[25:58] the expenses. I got [applause] my
[25:59] passport. I got my visa for everything.
[26:03] But brother Randy, Brother Randy saying,
[26:05] "What am I going to do? What am I going
[26:06] to do? I don't know how I'm going to pay
[26:07] for this. I don't know about the visa. I
[26:09] don't know about the pastor. What am I
[26:10] going to do?
[26:11] &gt;&gt; See, I'm just like me and you are.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; But [clears throat] what we have to do,
[26:15] we have to get a hold of ourselves.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; God is not going to stop you.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; He's not going to stop your brain.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; You have to deny yourself.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Deny your own thought
[26:32] &gt;&gt; and turn back to the word of God and
[26:34] say, "He will take care of it."
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. He will give. He is in fact
[26:41] as far as healing goes. He has already
[26:44] healed me.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; God cannot heal you.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Let that get into your heart this
[26:51] morning.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; God cannot heal you. He can't do
[26:55] something he's already done.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Well, why is this con condition going
[27:00] on? It's because you don't believe. Oh,
[27:02] I do believe. No, no, no, no, no. You
[27:05] think you believe.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You asking the question, why is
[27:09] this continuing on? Is confessing
[27:12] unbelief.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; If you believe, there's no question.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; It's finished.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; I believe it's done.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; And the devil can wrestle that away from
[27:25] me.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So life is very
[27:30] difficult. uh there the the people there
[27:33] in Egypt they had a very very difficult
[27:36] time. Uh it it wasn't an easy life.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Uh maybe some of you I'm not sure this
[27:44] is my first time in uh uh in South
[27:47] Africa. There's a brother a brother
[27:49] brother Arun Kumar who heard I was in
[27:52] India and he was I heard that I was
[27:55] going to uh uh South Africa and he told
[27:59] me he said you go to South Africa I'm
[28:01] going with you want to go with me he
[28:03] said yes so he is here in South Africa
[28:08] and uh but he's been tr troubled with
[28:11] bronchitis he's having a very difficult
[28:13] time right at this moment and I told him
[28:16] I said you know Brother, I said the
[28:19] children of God, they uh they they
[28:23] suffer persecution and they suffer
[28:25] trouble. Life is full of trouble.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, brother. Yes, life is
[28:30] full of trouble." I said, "But we've
[28:32] read the end of the book."
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; We know what the end is going to be.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; You see, and if we really believe his
[28:40] word, we know what the outcome is going
[28:43] to be.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:44] Well, if I got this condition, what if I
[28:47] die? You're still healed.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; You think God is going to receive cake
[28:53] take in a sick body? No. No. No. No. No.
[28:56] No. No. No. No.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; You just stepped from here. You stepped
[29:00] into his glory and you're going to be
[29:02] perfect. Everything.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; You don't have to. You're you're you're
[29:06] healed one way or another. It doesn't
[29:08] make you It doesn't change anything.
[29:12] Glory to his holy name. And so you see
[29:15] when they were coming out of Egypt, this
[29:17] was a a uh a a a time a a a time had
[29:22] come because God had given Moses Abraham
[29:25] a promise. And that promise was that
[29:29] your seed will be in a a land that they
[29:31] are strangers of and they won't be
[29:33] there. But I will bring them out uh in
[29:36] the fourth generation and I will bring
[29:38] them out and take them into a promised
[29:41] land.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Now this many this period of time has
[29:45] gone by and now they have been in the uh
[29:48] in Egypt for 400 years and the only life
[29:52] that they know is slavery.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; That is all that they know.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; They don't know anything else. And I'm
[29:59] going to jump ahead of our story. They
[30:02] don't know anything about fighting.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; They don't know anything about being
[30:06] soldiers.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; And you see before we come to Christ,
[30:11] the only thing that we know is this
[30:13] world. The only thing that we know is to
[30:16] live life the best way we know how. But
[30:19] when you come to Christ, Christ wants to
[30:22] live in us.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; He wants to live his life in us.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; St. Paul said it's not I that lives but
[30:30] it's Christ that lives [clears throat]
[30:32] within me.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; And this is God's ultimate goal that he
[30:37] would be be in us.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; And so as we are in this world uh and we
[30:44] don't know anything about God, it is
[30:46] very very difficult just like uh uh they
[30:49] were there in Egypt. They didn't know
[30:52] anything else. If you tell them about
[30:54] the promised land, they can't even
[30:56] imagine what this promised land is going
[30:58] to be about. And God, you tell people
[31:01] about this glory in this message. And
[31:05] people can't comprehend the glory that
[31:08] is there.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; And many people that are are have come
[31:12] into the land, this is actually further
[31:14] into the story, [laughter] but many
[31:16] people have come into the land and they
[31:18] still don't understand what God has for
[31:21] them.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. you know that they went into the
[31:24] promised land and they did not drive out
[31:26] the enemy.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; They said, "Well, you know, they're
[31:29] they're good people. We're not going to
[31:31] drive them out." No, no, no, no. You are
[31:33] not to sit down and and and and develop
[31:36] a life
[31:38] of compromise with the enemy.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; You are to drive them out. This land
[31:44] belongs to you
[31:45] &gt;&gt; and no one else is supposed to be there.
[31:48] But they did not understand the purpose
[31:50] of God though they are in the land. And
[31:53] it's the same way where people have come
[31:54] into the message they don't know the
[31:57] complete [laughter] purpose of God in
[31:59] what we are to become. Yes. You see?
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so as they are are are
[32:06] going to to come out, we know very very
[32:09] much the story about how that the Lord
[32:11] had spoken to Moses and uh uh God made
[32:15] Moses
[32:17] God.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Before the people. I know when this uh
[32:21] this was the Lord brought this greatly
[32:23] to my attention. I came to my our
[32:26] assembly at home. I was still pastoring
[32:28] and I had told them that uh uh I said
[32:32] Moses was God. And I just laid it there.
[32:34] I says Moses was God. And the church
[32:38] went quiet. My my assembly doesn't just
[32:41] shout just over for no reason at all.
[32:43] And they went quiet. I said, "You're
[32:46] quiet. You should be praising the Lord."
[32:48] I And I emphasized AND SAID AGAIN,
[32:51] "MOSES WAS GOD." OH, because I I just
[32:55] could sense their mind. But oh, he was a
[32:57] man. He's not God. But no, no, no, no.
[33:00] Mo God called him God. So therefore, he
[33:05] was God before the people.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Even even now you're wondering which
[33:11] which direction is he going?
[33:15] &gt;&gt; You're already wondering just like they
[33:17] had done. But you see, God had taken
[33:19] this man and lifted him up. This sinner
[33:23] lifted him up to a position that he was
[33:27] God.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; He was so much God that he rebuked God.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; And he said that don't kill them because
[33:35] if you killed them, they're going to say
[33:37] you were able to bring them out of
[33:39] Egypt, but you couldn't take them into
[33:40] the promised land. And the Lord said,
[33:43] "AT YOUR WORD, I will do."
[33:46] &gt;&gt; I will DO ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU HAVE
[33:49] SAID.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. God listened to Moses.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; When did a man ever rebuke God? Nobody
[33:56] has ever done that, but Moses did.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Exactly. True.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; And and brother Ben said that uh God had
[34:05] to listen to Moses because he made Moses
[34:09] God. Yeah.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; So now we as we study the story of
[34:15] Moses, we find out Moses said God had
[34:18] spoken to him that he would rise up
[34:20] another prophet likened unto himself.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; So then therefore there's going to be
[34:25] another prophet that's going to be rise
[34:28] up who is also going to be God before
[34:31] the people.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:33] But you see as brother Brandon very
[34:36] plainly says if you go back to faith is
[34:38] a substance that's in 1947
[34:41] you find out that he says there he says
[34:44] was Moses God uh was it Moses or was it
[34:49] God in Moses that delivered the people?
[34:53] &gt;&gt; It was God in Moses.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't Moses but it was God. What
[35:00] made Moses God? The word was placed in
[35:04] Moses.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; That's what made him God.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; We know that the Lord uh even through
[35:10] this message has told us that we are uh
[35:13] Messiah.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; We are we are made gods.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; As we go along here, let let me just
[35:24] kind of give you some insight. When
[35:26] brother Brandham was uh the Lord told
[35:29] brother Brandham to speak to the
[35:31] squirrels and he spoke to the squirrels
[35:34] and spoke not to but created that
[35:37] squirrels were created.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; And we know the storm. We know that he
[35:41] spoke to the bull the bees. He spoke to
[35:44] the storm.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; He spoke uh about his wife having a
[35:48] tumor. The Lord said you say say what
[35:51] you will and it'll be done. He says when
[35:53] they go to put the knife to her side
[35:55] that the tumor will be gone. And that's
[35:57] exactly what happened.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; What was God doing in those moments?
[36:02] &gt;&gt; He was making it was for us.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; He was making him God.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Now many people have [laughter] taken
[36:14] this too far.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is God. No. Brother
[36:17] Brandham was a man.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; But you see what makes the difference is
[36:22] God in the man.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; God is using the man. What makes the
[36:26] differences in in your life is God in
[36:28] you.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; It's no longer you where it's God in you
[36:32] doing the work.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[36:35] &gt;&gt; People put too much emphasis on brother
[36:37] Brandham. Brother Brandham is in the
[36:39] grave.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; You see, but the God that was in brother
[36:42] Brandham is still here. Amen. Amen. And
[36:44] he wants that work the same way in your
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; You [clears throat] have a circumstance
[36:50] that that you have and uh uh he wants
[36:54] you to speak to the circumstances.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; If you're like I had to do body, you've
[37:01] got to change. You've got this situation
[37:03] in I got this situation in the body.
[37:05] BONNIE, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE cuz the Bible
[37:07] says you you have to change. Yes.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; And well, brother, that means we can
[37:13] speak anytime we want.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; If you watch Brother Renom that when he
[37:20] spoke,
[37:22] it was always by the leadership of God.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you don't let your mind
[37:27] stray. Don't don't think I'm just
[37:29] talking here.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; I'm talk I'm talking about a level that
[37:34] God is calling all of us to.
[37:38] Yes.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; You know that the Bible says,
[37:45] well, let me say this verse. How many
[37:47] times have we prayed and say asking the
[37:49] Lord, we we desire the Lord to do this
[37:52] situation?
[37:55] How many have done that? How many pray
[37:56] that Lord, I'm praying.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Let me see your hand.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Ah, that's it. Don't get
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I I did.
[38:09] No, you see, we have prayed, BUT THE
[38:11] BIBLE SAYS that we when he was
[38:14] crucified, he said, "It is finished."
[38:16] And he rose to the right hand of the
[38:19] father.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he sat down.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; And what is he doing there
[38:30] &gt;&gt; when he sat down?
[38:32] waiting,
[38:35] &gt;&gt; waiting that every enemy will become his
[38:38] foottool. It doesn't say he was going to
[38:40] get up.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I want you to do this. No, no,
[38:45] no, no, no. You do.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT GOD IS LOOKING FOR. IF HE
[38:53] WERE TO stand right here and he said,
[38:55] "LORD, I HAVE THIS. WOULD YOU DO THIS
[38:56] FOR ME?" HE SAID, "NO, you do it."
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. SAY, LORD, I DON'T HAVE ANY
[39:02] POWER. HE SAYS, I GAVE YOU THE POWER.
[39:05] [applause]
[39:07] &gt;&gt; I gave you everything that you need.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; I GAVE YOU THE PROMISE. I GAVE YOU MY
[39:12] SPIRIT. WHAT MORE CAN I DO FOR YOU?
[39:16] &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You have the power to
[39:19] overcome.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, as we see uh in
[39:25] every church age, the the promise is to
[39:27] to overcome. Yes.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; If you can't be an overcomer, you can't
[39:32] be one of his
[39:34] &gt;&gt; because he only has overcome.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; So, here they are coming out of Egypt.
[39:41] [clears throat]
[39:42] &gt;&gt; And oh my, they are so happy they're
[39:45] coming out of Egypt. They're excited.
[39:47] Now, people come into the we come into
[39:51] come to Christ and we're just uh in a
[39:53] big jubilee time. It's so rejoicing, but
[39:56] we have no idea the trials that we're
[39:58] going to run into.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; And especially I I remember many years
[40:02] ago that the air was just buzzing. This
[40:05] was a
[40:08] uh a period of time that was much before
[40:11] any of you were born. But the air was
[40:14] buzzing with the message.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; People were listening to the message and
[40:19] reading the books of the message and
[40:21] talking about the message. Oh my. Praise
[40:23] the Lord. Glory to God. And now we have
[40:26] so many uh uh factions and so many
[40:29] divisions in the message and one
[40:31] believes this and one believes that and
[40:33] they have all their different ideas and
[40:36] so much confusion has come and uh many
[40:39] of us can hardly believe that we would
[40:42] come to all of this.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Exactly true. And [clears throat] today
[40:48] as like our brother, the pastor and I
[40:51] were talking last night and we were
[40:53] talking and asking the question, is it
[40:56] possible that God, the angel of the Lord
[40:59] can be right in our midst and people are
[41:02] not sensing it. I Yes, brother. That's
[41:05] exactly true.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord was walking right
[41:08] in our midst. And because this is a new
[41:11] generation.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[41:14] You see, and we become, and using the
[41:17] pastor's uh uh uh terminology, we become
[41:20] desensitized.
[41:22] We're not uh sensitive enough to know
[41:26] God is in our midst.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; And wherever wherever Jesus was,
[41:33] something happened. [applause]
[41:35] [cheering]
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Something.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Demons didn't like to be around you.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PHARISEES DIDN'T LIKE HIM.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Everywhere he
[41:48] everywhere he went, if he was blind,
[41:50] he's no longer blind. If he's deaf, he's
[41:52] no longer dead. If he was dead, HE'S NO
[41:54] LONGER DEAD.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Something always [cheering and applause]
[41:57] happened.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; And many times WE CAN COME TO CHURCH AND
[42:00] the the spirit of God IS MOVING AMONGST
[42:03] US AND WE GO BACK IN the same condition.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Why does that happen?
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN? IS BECAUSE WE'RE
[42:12] DESENSITIZED.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; YES,
[42:14] &gt;&gt; brother Brennan. I listen I studied
[42:16] brother Brennan uh and I watched him
[42:19] very closely and I HEAR HIM COMPELLING
[42:21] THE PEOPLE CRYING OUT TO THE PEOPLE.
[42:24] HE'S HERE my friend. He's here. Just
[42:26] believe. [laughter] Just believe he's
[42:28] here. He's here. And I hear that heart
[42:31] groaning AND KNOWING THAT GOD HIMSELF,
[42:35] HE SAID, "DON'T YOU SEE THIS light
[42:36] standing over here?
[42:39] &gt;&gt; HE'S RIGHT HERE. IS MOVING IN THE
[42:41] BUILDING.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; YES.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; I know that uh in one of the services he
[42:48] was going to uh uh get into the message
[42:51] and he he he said, "Let's turn to uh
[42:54] such and such a a portion in the
[42:56] scriptures and uh uh they were turning
[42:59] there and he stopped." Oh, you sister
[43:02] there in the back. He says, "Something
[43:04] just happened to you."
[43:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't read the scriptures. He hasn't
[43:08] even started preaching. Yes,
[43:10] &gt;&gt; sister. You're in the back. Something
[43:11] just happened to you.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; You felt something, didn't you? And uh
[43:15] he said, "He just healed you."
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "You just touched the throne of
[43:20] God." I said, "Look at that." You see,
[43:23] that person wasn't waiting on the
[43:25] preaching.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. They weren't waiting on worship.
[43:28] They weren't waiting for hands to be
[43:29] laid on them. They knew God was in the
[43:32] building and they reached out and
[43:34] touched God and got their their
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, we become so de
[43:40] desensitized
[43:42] and we're always waiting on something.
[43:45] You don't have to wait.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; One day I hope our life changed. WHY
[43:50] DON'T WE START NOW?
[43:51] &gt;&gt; YES.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T WE START TODAY?
[43:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Instead of staying in Egypt, WE
[43:56] HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. LET'S GET OUT.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; YES.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; God sent the deliverer.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. SO THEY'RE GOING OUT OF
[44:04] EGYPT AND NOW THEY ARE JUST so happy. We
[44:08] are no longer going to be slaves. We
[44:09] don't have to make any more bricks. It
[44:12] becomes so boring. They've been making
[44:14] bricks every day. Every day. And
[44:17] building a kingdom for somebody else.
[44:20] Now we're not going to be here for be a
[44:22] slave anymore. We're going out. And now
[44:24] they come down to the Red Sea. Uh the
[44:26] very place God wants them to be because
[44:28] they have to go through their baptism.
[44:30] Yes,
[44:30] &gt;&gt; there's mountains on the either side of
[44:32] it and the Egyptians are behind and what
[44:34] do they do? They begin to complain and
[44:37] they say, "OH, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
[44:39] We're going to die. We're going to die.
[44:40] We should have stayed in Egypt. You mean
[44:42] you want to go back to being a slave?
[44:46] &gt;&gt; He just set you free. But look, WE'RE
[44:48] GOING TO DIE. LOOK AT THE CONDITION THAT
[44:50] WE'RE IN. Didn't he uh protect you from
[44:54] the plagues? Amen. Was there any flies
[44:56] in your house? [laughter] Amen. Was
[44:58] there was there any darkness in your
[45:00] house? You look at the supernatural THAT
[45:03] HAPPENED. YOU MEAN GOD cannot take care
[45:05] of you here? THAT'S THE PROBLEM OF US.
[45:08] WE we see many signs. WE SEE THE
[45:11] EVIDENCE OF GOD WORKING. BUT WHEN WE GET
[45:13] INTO THE MOMENT, WE CANNOT BELIEVE GOD
[45:16] for the moment.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT DID MOSES SAY? HE SAID, "BE
[45:24] STILL." YES.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; And that's one of the major things we
[45:26] need to do in our walk with God. WE NEED
[45:29] TO SETTLE our spirit down. We need to
[45:32] SETTLE DOWN AND START FOCUSING ON THE
[45:34] PURPOSE THAT GOD HAS IN OUR LIFE AND THE
[45:37] VICTORY THAT HE HAS GIVEN UNTO US. He
[45:40] said, "BE STILL AND WATCH."
[45:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WATCH THE SALVATION OF GOD.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO? YOU DON'T
[45:47] HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BUT WATCH
[45:49] [screaming] GOD AT WORK. [applause]
[45:51] [cheering]
[45:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ONCE GOD MANIFEST HIS WORD.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, where where's OUR ESCAPE
[46:02] WHEN THEY DID NOT KNOW the escape
[46:05] &gt;&gt; is in front of them.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; They couldn't see it.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Because the escape was in the Red Sea.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; And when uh when Moses had uh stretched
[46:18] out the staff and through the night, the
[46:20] waters opened up. They in the morning
[46:23] they were very surprised to see this
[46:25] path through the through the waters.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So there they go. And you
[46:31] know it's such a complete
[46:34] [clears throat] supernatural thing that
[46:36] took place. Yes. Yes. Yes. Opening up
[46:38] the waters. But listen
[46:41] though that ground should have been
[46:43] muddy.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; That ground has laid under that water
[46:50] for ages. Yes.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; And it should have been muddy and it was
[46:54] dust.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; God sucked all the water out. They
[46:59] didn't even get [applause] any mud on
[47:00] their shoes.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; And they walk to the other side. And
[47:05] when THEY GET OVER NOW, [screaming] THEY
[47:07] REJOICE. AND I could see Moses. Uh, now
[47:10] you rejoice.
[47:13] You weren't rejoicing on the other side.
[47:16] But after you see God, God can come and
[47:19] deliver you. now that you're going to
[47:20] rejoice. You should have known what God
[47:23] could do before that.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; So the next time you run into a
[47:27] situation and it looks like uh that
[47:30] there is no hope.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand there is hope.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; You know that happened to brother
[47:38] Brennan.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; You know when his first wife died, you
[47:41] know what her name was?
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Hope.
[47:45] And he was miserable because hope was
[47:49] gone.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; And he was so depressed and discouraged
[47:55] because hope was gone that God had to
[48:00] take him to the other side and show him
[48:03] hope still lives.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; We get into the same situation.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; We think there's no hope. Hope still
[48:13] exists. Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Exactly true. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[48:19] [clears throat]
[48:20] Amen.
[48:23] We may be a child. We may be an heir,
[48:28] but we do not know how to cross
[48:32] uh access the glory and the power of
[48:37] God. You see, that is the the problem
[48:40] with the people through the ages.
[48:42] that God calls unto his people, but the
[48:45] people of God do not know how to access
[48:48] that power, that glory.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; It's very simple.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; It's very simple. And it just takes
[48:56] faith.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; But you have to understand what faith
[49:00] is.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Faith does not ask questions.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; It doesn't ask questions. Faith just
[49:09] sees the word, says that's it. Yes.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; I will ask you this.
[49:18] How many know without a doubt in your
[49:20] heart that God sent a prophet in this
[49:23] day?
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; You think that's not important to lift
[49:30] your hand, but the devil seeing whether
[49:32] you lift your hand, whether you believe
[49:33] it or not.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:35] You see, [clears throat] you you want
[49:36] you want to let Satan know anytime
[49:38] you're asked a question like that, you
[49:39] need to let Satan see, I'm a believer.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; See that hand right there? I'm a
[49:44] believer.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; So, you believe that he has uh he God
[49:48] has sent a prophet in his day. Can
[49:50] somebody talk you out of that?
[49:53] &gt;&gt; No. You really believe that?
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Why?
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; What is it that's in your heart?
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, Lord. that says I know.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[50:08] &gt;&gt; And no one you know that no one can
[50:10] change your thoughts. Some of the
[50:12] younger ones they might say well yeah I
[50:14] believe it but I I don't know. I don't
[50:16] know a lot about this stuff. They just
[50:18] need to be more secure.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; But you see many of us have come to a
[50:23] place we are anchored. I'm using that as
[50:25] an example.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. that uh we have become so anchored
[50:30] that that faith cannot be moved.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; You cannot move me over that. I know
[50:37] that this is thus said the Lord.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Well, you don't realize you're wrong.
[50:42] Look, just leave me alone.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; I believe this and it's not changing.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; No matter what you say, you're wasting
[50:50] your time.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; You see, that is faith. Yes.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Faith does not question.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Faith does not reason.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; And to access the glory and the power of
[51:03] God, that's the kind of faith you have
[51:05] to use.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, sir.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; And when you begin to ask questions and
[51:10] uh uh like saying, "Well, why isn't
[51:12] there changes? Why isn't something
[51:14] happening?" That's Satan attacking you
[51:16] and he's shaking your faith.
[51:20] And you see, he was he said he would
[51:22] shake the heavens and the earth and he's
[51:24] going to shake you.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And the trial of your faith is more
[51:28] precious than gold. So the question is,
[51:32] do you really have faith or is it just
[51:34] your imagination?
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when they came out, they did
[51:40] not know about the [clears throat]
[51:44] I'm sorry. They didn't know uh about the
[51:47] glory of God. They just the only thing
[51:49] they could see is the moment we're at
[51:51] the Red Sea. We're going to we're going
[51:53] to die. They come to the waters of Myra
[51:55] next and that they're oh, we're here.
[51:57] The waters are poisoned. We're going to
[51:59] die. Each moment, each step that they
[52:02] took, they come to a an obstacle and oh,
[52:05] we're in trouble. What are we going to
[52:06] do? What are we going to do? It was
[52:08] because it was a mixed multitude.
[52:11] Yes.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Not everybody's going to be a believer.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; And out of that out of that group that
[52:18] were coming was we understand that there
[52:20] were two million. That's why you
[52:22] remember brother Brandham preached a one
[52:23] in a million.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; There are two million that come out and
[52:27] out of that there was only two that
[52:29] believe.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; There's only two that believe. So it
[52:35] came out with a mixed mixed multitude.
[52:38] And we are not to walk with God and uh
[52:43] and walk with the Lord and say, "Well,
[52:45] my brother over here, he believes like
[52:47] that and you know, I got respect to him.
[52:49] I have fellowship with the the brother
[52:51] and so this is this is what must be
[52:54] right. He believes a little differently,
[52:56] but I'm going to lean to what he is
[52:58] saying because it must be right." No,
[53:01] no, no, no. It's you and God.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; It's you and God. You have to have a
[53:07] personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[53:10] It's not what the other brother thinks,
[53:11] the other sister thinks. It has to be
[53:14] you and God.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that that's the only way
[53:19] that faith can be anchored in Jesus
[53:21] Christ that you are in tune with God. Am
[53:24] I making any sense?
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to his holy name.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; You see, people were uh uh God is
[53:32] desiring. He's bringing us not only from
[53:35] denominational world uh he's bringing us
[53:38] from just the world of sin and bringing
[53:40] in us into something that is magnificent
[53:44] and glorious.
[53:46] Hallelujah. And uh [clears throat]
[53:51] give me a second here.
[54:07] in [clears throat] the message uh
[54:10] uh the great warrior Joshua
[54:14] it's in 1955
[54:16] he says and now uh God [clears throat]
[54:20] uh God told Moses go out now and look
[54:24] around and get a man out of every tribe
[54:27] and send them over into the promised
[54:30] land
[54:32] just a a few days after he had left the
[54:35] Egypt. Send them over now and spy out
[54:38] the land and then come back and give a
[54:41] report.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. COME BACK AND GIVE A testimony of
[54:45] what you experienced about being in that
[54:47] land. And when they went over across the
[54:50] little river Jordan and went over into
[54:53] the promised land and begin to look
[54:56] around to see whether it was a lean or
[54:59] whether uh it was a good
[55:04] down Yes, we're down at uh we're in
[55:08] paragraph 19 right now.
[55:14] And when they went out over across the
[55:16] little river Jordan and went over into
[55:18] the promised land and begin to look
[55:20] around to see whether it was lean or
[55:23] whether it was good or whether it was of
[55:25] grapes or whether it was of fruits, when
[55:28] they come back, they climbed up uh and
[55:31] cut down a a bunch of grapes that taken
[55:34] two men uh to pack them. But a bunch of
[55:38] grapes, I think of a land with a curse
[55:41] on it.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[55:43] &gt;&gt; uh uh will grow something like that.
[55:46] What would it grow when the curse is off
[55:49] of it?
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; My my my
[55:55] &gt;&gt; it was under the enemy. See, it was
[55:57] under the dominion of the uh uh of the
[56:01] um Canaanites.
[56:04] And now the the Jews were going to come
[56:06] in and take over the lion land. And if
[56:10] it uh is uh producing grapes as such
[56:14] under the Canaanites, what is it going
[56:16] to do under the blessings of God?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; I think if a land they curse, it will
[56:21] grow grow something like that that will
[56:23] go to grow when the curse is off. Uh
[56:26] here they come back. But when they
[56:28] looked over into the land and seen all
[56:30] the Philistines and the Amorites and the
[56:32] Hivites and the parasites and all of
[56:34] those fellows all walled up and sitting
[56:37] in their big kingdoms and so forth, they
[56:39] they quivered or they were afraid in the
[56:43] in their boots, they come back and said,
[56:45] "Oh, when we when they called a council
[56:49] and brought all the children of Israel
[56:51] out, beautiful type now, and they took
[56:53] up and said, uh, the land is beautiful.
[56:55] It's wonderful. It would be good if we
[56:58] could uh have a revival like that. But
[57:01] when we just can't do it, we just can't
[57:05] do it. That's all. Oh, we're just a prey
[57:08] to them. Uh say my Well, they're they're
[57:13] way bigger. They are bigger. They're
[57:15] giants. Why? They're giants and so
[57:17] forth. And they're walled in and it's
[57:21] impossible for us to take them. Oh, why
[57:23] did you bring us out of our churches out
[57:26] into this kind of land? And exactly what
[57:29] I am talking about is when they come
[57:31] into this promised land, they have all
[57:34] these reasoning, [clears throat] all of
[57:36] these questions that are going on. God
[57:40] wants us to go in there and he's telling
[57:41] us there are many blessings that are
[57:43] there and we see that it is true. But
[57:47] why uh h how are we going to do it?
[57:50] because the devil attacks me. I have so
[57:53] many demons around me and I don't know
[57:55] what to do. I have this trial. I have
[57:58] that trial and I don't know if I'm going
[58:00] to make it because I have to fight here
[58:02] and I have to fight there. But you see
[58:04] the uh the Lord had already told us
[58:06] resist the enemy and he will flee from.
[58:09] Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, instead of complaining
[58:12] about our trials, complaining about the
[58:15] situation, we should recognize that we
[58:18] are fulfilling the promises [laughter]
[58:20] of God that have been made from ages in
[58:24] the past.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; We are fulfilling scriptures today.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; You [laughter] are sitting here
[58:30] fulfilling scriptures.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T REALIZE IT, BUT YOU ARE
[58:36] FULFILLING SCRIPTURES.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE GOD HAS SAID THERE WILL BE
[58:41] A PEOPLE THAT WILL COME AND BELIEVE THIS
[58:44] MESSAGE.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise the Lord. I want you
[58:50] to notice this come in my mind just then
[58:54] when Moses sent those 10 spies over. It
[58:58] was in in the harvest of grapes, harvest
[59:01] time.
[59:03] perfect type of Pentecost, first fruits,
[59:06] Pentecost in and in in gathering, first
[59:08] harvest. And when they was at Kadesh
[59:11] Barnea at judgment, you know why? I know
[59:14] that for me that was always a confusing
[59:17] thing when brother Brandon would say
[59:18] this that going to Kadesh Barnea, it's
[59:21] the judgment. Why? Why is that the
[59:24] judgment?
[59:25] Because they had to make a decision.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:30] And God was going to judge them for
[59:33] their decision.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Is this land worthy to take?
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And they and to to embrace.
[59:46] And they made a decision and said, "No,
[59:49] it is not worth it. It's not worth our
[59:52] efforts." Do you realize how much
[59:55] energy, how much effort we have to fight
[59:58] giants?
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to fight
[1:00:02] demons.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; We all have to fight demons.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; But you know, as I said last night, is
[1:00:13] that one person, one soul
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; armed with the the word of God, the Holy
[1:00:20] Spirit in this message.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:22] All of those demons are no match for
[1:00:25] that one.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And in this age, there's
[1:00:32] 200,000,000
[1:00:34] more demons
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; than what there was in ages past.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; That is 200 million demons on top of
[1:00:43] what was what there was. WHAT CHANCE?
[1:00:45] WHAT OPPORTUNITY DO WE REALLY HAVE?
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; But you see what God has given us. All
[1:00:51] of those demons,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; are no match for one another.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has given us such power to
[1:00:59] make them all free.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we're able to set
[1:01:05] your
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; and sit here in the presence of God
[1:01:09] because of that power he has given unto
[1:01:11] us.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; There are many pe I I I know of people
[1:01:16] that have come in and out of church for
[1:01:19] many years. uh uh in in our uh place at
[1:01:24] home and they come into church and they
[1:01:27] wanted to serve the Lord and what
[1:01:29] happened the world pulled them back out.
[1:01:30] They came back in again and they've
[1:01:33] tried to serve the Lord and the world
[1:01:35] pulled them back out again. They cannot
[1:01:37] re resist the demons that are pulling on
[1:01:41] them. And one man I'm thinking about how
[1:01:44] many it's been probably 35 years or so
[1:01:47] that this man come in contact with the
[1:01:49] message and he he was out in he come to
[1:01:52] the message went out into the world and
[1:01:54] he come back again and then one day he
[1:01:56] just disappeared and he was gone and and
[1:01:59] I never got any word from him. I don't
[1:02:00] know where he went to or anything like
[1:02:03] that. And uh I think what happened? He
[1:02:06] was doing so well listening to the word
[1:02:08] of God and the glory of God moving in
[1:02:10] his moving in his life and uh and yet
[1:02:14] still he could not did not have the
[1:02:16] strength to continue on with Jesus. We
[1:02:19] have to fight demons.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; But it's not a problem.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; I think it might be Yeah, I think it
[1:02:29] just come back on.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; There's something loose. It's It's now
[1:02:34] back on.
[1:02:38] It wasn't my brain [laughter]
[1:02:41] for a change.
[1:02:46] You keep an eye on me, brother.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You see, I spoke
[1:02:52] last night about gratitude. We should be
[1:02:55] very grateful for what the Lord is has
[1:02:57] done for us.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Don't you feel that way?
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; To think you he called you.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. by you.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Are you something special? If you look
[1:03:08] in the mirror, if you're like me, I
[1:03:09] said, "Oh, Randy, you're a wretched
[1:03:11] soul. You're you're you're a very
[1:03:13] important preacher." But Jesus loved
[1:03:15] you.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus loved me.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And I'm so grateful that the Lord would
[1:03:21] call me.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; And you know, I I I look on myself and I
[1:03:25] don't see myself as a very I I don't see
[1:03:28] myself as a very good person. I get many
[1:03:31] compliments and uh many times being
[1:03:33] called such a a man of God and I I have
[1:03:36] to bow my head and I said Lord it's only
[1:03:39] by your grace
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; I I I am actually actually nothing and
[1:03:45] in all of what I am to think that the
[1:03:48] Lord loved me anyway but you know I I
[1:03:51] learned why he loves me.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:55] why he loves me. And this is not our
[1:03:57] subject for today, but uh why he loves
[1:04:01] me is because like Mary, when Mary was
[1:04:03] told that she was going to have a child
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; without a man,
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; she believed it.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; She believed an impossible message.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; And God always comes with an impossible
[1:04:22] message.
[1:04:24] A message that's hard to believe by the
[1:04:26] world, but it's still true.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And when Mary uh uh uh heard the message
[1:04:35] from the angel, she took it and she
[1:04:37] believed it with all of her heart.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; And when this message came to me, I have
[1:04:42] to bow my head, Lord, I believe this
[1:04:44] message. I know it is true. I know it's
[1:04:47] thus sayeth the Lord, and I'm staying
[1:04:49] with it. And I realized that's the
[1:04:52] reason why the Lord chose me.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why the Lord would
[1:04:56] choose you because before the
[1:04:58] foundations of the world, he already
[1:05:00] knew you were going to take this path
[1:05:02] and cling to the word of God.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Let's say praise the Lord.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause]
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's say praise the Lord again.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; So, let's finish this here. And uh
[1:05:16] and when they was at Kadesh Barnea at
[1:05:18] the at the judgment, then it was to be
[1:05:21] determined on whether they could go over
[1:05:23] and get the Holy Spirit or not into the
[1:05:26] land of promise. Where they promise? Uh
[1:05:29] yet you say, "Is that a promise?" And
[1:05:31] yes, Peter said, "Repent and be baptized
[1:05:33] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:05:35] Christ for the remission of your sins.
[1:05:37] You shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:05:39] Ghost. for the promise is unto you and
[1:05:41] to your children and to them that are
[1:05:43] far far off. Uh uh even Chicago as many
[1:05:47] as the Lord your God shall call. We got
[1:05:50] too many people to saying uh it's too
[1:05:53] hard. We can't do it. We can it's
[1:05:57] harvest. This is the reason that they
[1:06:00] got this big bunch of grapes and brought
[1:06:02] it back for for a heaven. I can see
[1:06:06] Caleb and Joshua with that on their
[1:06:08] shoulders, marching down through there,
[1:06:10] just singing the Jubilee song. Uh they
[1:06:14] had the evidence. They could prove that
[1:06:16] it was a good land. They brought it back
[1:06:19] and give all the children a grape. Now,
[1:06:22] I like this part here. They give all
[1:06:24] they brought it back and give all the
[1:06:27] children a grape if they wanted one off
[1:06:31] of one cluster. Just look what a bunch
[1:06:34] of of grapes uh that they had. Now
[1:06:37] Joshua and Caleb, but when they heard
[1:06:39] all this murmuring, the people saying,
[1:06:42] "Oh, it can't be done. It can't be."
[1:06:44] Caleb run out in the midst of the people
[1:06:47] and quiet them and said, "It yes, it can
[1:06:51] be done."
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Joshua stood by him and certainly uh it
[1:06:56] can be. God's given it to us. Amen. I I
[1:06:59] like that. Yes, sir. What was it? They
[1:07:03] were potentially born in Christ. They
[1:07:06] had a knowledge of the word and the word
[1:07:09] become manifested. Remember, every one
[1:07:12] of those Israelites had the word of God
[1:07:15] preached to them.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Every one of them had the word of God
[1:07:20] preached to them. But it only had taken
[1:07:23] effect upon Caleb and Joshua to realize
[1:07:26] what it was all about.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so what we find is
[1:07:30] taking place.
[1:07:33] What we find is taking place, they came
[1:07:35] up to that promised land and at Kadesh
[1:07:38] Barnea there are those that made a
[1:07:40] decision that we cannot go into the
[1:07:42] land. So what happens? They wandered
[1:07:44] around in the wilderness for 40 years
[1:07:46] and they those died
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; and God raised up a new generation. Now,
[1:07:51] as they come up, I want you to picture
[1:07:54] as we're coming near a close now, I want
[1:07:57] you to take notice as they come up to
[1:07:59] the promised land,
[1:08:01] they had not matured.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; They were slaves.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And they had not matured because they
[1:08:11] were going to have to become warriors.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; They were going to have to fight.
[1:08:19] You see those that are in the kingdom of
[1:08:21] God that those especially those that are
[1:08:23] going to walk in this message, you're
[1:08:25] going to have to be a warrior.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; And every demon is going to hell going
[1:08:30] to try to keep you from walking in this
[1:08:32] message. That's right.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; For me, the many years I've just so
[1:08:38] thankful for the faith that the Lord has
[1:08:39] given me and I was speaking about it
[1:08:42] last night and share it with you. You
[1:08:44] know the cloud in 1963.
[1:08:46] They are telling us that today that was
[1:08:48] not a cloud.
[1:08:52] It's not a cloud. Uh or uh I'm sorry.
[1:08:56] It's not seven angels. It's not seven
[1:08:58] angels. It's a rocket that created the
[1:09:01] cloud.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; And I I was telling the church at home,
[1:09:08] I said, "Well, they're saying it is a
[1:09:10] rocket that it that did all of this."
[1:09:13] And uh but I have to say this, praise
[1:09:16] the Lord for the rocket.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Well, why would you say praise the Lord
[1:09:22] for rocket? Because it's a supernatural
[1:09:24] rocket.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; If you turn the picture, it still shows
[1:09:28] Christ.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; You can't change that.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; And you see it that you have to be a
[1:09:35] warrior in this message. Many people in
[1:09:38] the message are not maturing.
[1:09:42] And what is happening? They become
[1:09:44] people that are in the in in the gospel
[1:09:47] and we are deceiving ourselves and we're
[1:09:50] rejoicing and praising. You remember
[1:09:52] brother Ben said that about a boy that
[1:09:55] was in the graveyard and he's whistling
[1:09:57] as he goes through the graveyard. And
[1:09:59] what he's trying to do, he's trying to
[1:10:00] encourage himself because he is afraid
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; and he hasn't got the courage of what uh
[1:10:08] uh what one would expect. And his
[1:10:12] whistling shows that. And people today,
[1:10:13] they're shouting and praising the Lord
[1:10:15] and just so happy. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:17] Thank God we're in the light. Show and
[1:10:19] so on. But you see, you have to be a
[1:10:22] warrior.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; You can't deceive your way into the
[1:10:27] kingdom of God. It doesn't work.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; It You see, we can we can listen to the
[1:10:33] teachings, and we're getting a little
[1:10:35] little deeper here. We you can listen to
[1:10:38] the teachings and and all of this, but
[1:10:40] God wants to work in your life. He wants
[1:10:42] to make a warrior out of you.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; And not just walk around and praise the
[1:10:49] Lord. We're free. We're not in the
[1:10:51] world. We're not in the organization,
[1:10:52] but we're in the message. But what's the
[1:10:54] purpose?
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES GOD WANT TO MAKE OUT OF YOU?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT A SLAVE ANYMORE. THEN WHAT ARE
[1:11:03] YOU?
[1:11:05] WHAT DOES GOD WANT TO MAKE OUT OF YOU?
[1:11:07] WHAT DOES HE WANT TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE?
[1:11:10] He pro he PICKED THIS UP OUT OF THE
[1:11:12] WORLD. Many of you young maybe grew up
[1:11:14] in a Christian home, but still God wants
[1:11:18] to make something out OF YOU. AND WHAT
[1:11:20] DOES GOD WANT TO DO WITH YOU?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He wants you to make
[1:11:25] you a powerhouse.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; A VESSEL THAT IS FULL OF POWER THAT
[1:11:31] DEMONS are afraid of.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] Amen. Glory to God.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And see, when they came, there was only
[1:11:38] two THAT GOD HAD FULFILLED THAT WORK IN
[1:11:42] THEM BECAUSE JOSHUA AND CALEB, and if
[1:11:45] you'll notice that Caleb means dog
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; or a gentile,
[1:11:50] and the other one was uh standing there
[1:11:53] was Joshua, but Joshua didn't speak. It
[1:11:56] was Caleb doing the speaking.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Joshua means Jesus.
[1:12:01] You see, these were the Jews that came
[1:12:03] out. But who is actually going to go in
[1:12:06] and take that promised land? It's going
[1:12:08] to be the Gentiles walking with Jesus is
[1:12:11] going to go in and take the promised
[1:12:13] land.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; GOD HAD TO RAISE UP A NEW GROUP of
[1:12:16] people that were willing to go across
[1:12:19] the the Jordan.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; And Joshua said, "We are more than
[1:12:26] able." Well, when this new group came
[1:12:28] up, they were believers and knew that
[1:12:30] they could cross the river. BUT WHEN
[1:12:32] THEY CAME TO THE RIVER, what's the
[1:12:34] river's name? Jordan.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Death.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; When they came to death, the Bible says
[1:12:41] it was a harvest time. And Jordan was
[1:12:43] overflowing.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; AND JORDAN IS SAYING, "YOU'RE NOT GOING
[1:12:48] TO PASS OVER. You cannot. YOU STEP IN
[1:12:52] HERE and I will sweep you away."
[1:12:55] You remember in Revelations 12, it said
[1:12:57] the dragon opened up his mouth and sent
[1:13:00] a a a flood.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; After the woman, there is a flood at
[1:13:05] harvest time. And they're wanting now to
[1:13:08] go over in the across the river, go into
[1:13:11] the promised land. And the ene the the
[1:13:13] the Jordan is full waiting to sweep away
[1:13:17] the people of God.
[1:13:19] But they the the Lord said, "Call the
[1:13:21] priest, BRING THE ARK of the covenant
[1:13:23] and tell them to go and stand in the
[1:13:25] Jordan." And those uh those priests went
[1:13:28] out and they stood right there in the
[1:13:30] Jordan.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; We are NOT MOVING
[1:13:35] JORDAN. We are here and we are going to
[1:13:37] Passover and we have the ark of the
[1:13:39] covenant here.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You see friends, all of
[1:13:43] these events
[1:13:45] have a message.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And that message is for you.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; These are not just stories.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; This is a message.
[1:13:55] And we can see ourselves in these events
[1:13:59] taking place.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Jordan is standing there and does not
[1:14:03] want them to cross. But they the Lord
[1:14:05] told him, "Take the ark of the covenant,
[1:14:07] stand in the Jordan, and watch what
[1:14:09] happens." The Jordan opened up and they
[1:14:12] crossed over on dry ground.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. They they get to the
[1:14:17] other side. And after they get to the
[1:14:19] other side, Joshua uh tells them, "We're
[1:14:22] going to stop right here and we're going
[1:14:24] to have a ceremony. We're going to have
[1:14:25] circumcision.
[1:14:27] We can't live in this land without
[1:14:30] circumcision."
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need the baptism of the
[1:14:34] Holy Ghost.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; We need a meeting of getting the baptism
[1:14:38] of the Holy Ghost. We can't live in this
[1:14:40] land without the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:42] Ghost.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. And so there they
[1:14:45] are. They had the they went through the
[1:14:47] time of circumcision. And now they're
[1:14:49] going along. They come up to Jericho.
[1:14:51] And uh uh and here is the time of uh
[1:14:55] [clears throat]
[1:14:56] uh uh uh Gideon
[1:15:00] uh Joshua. And he is standing there.
[1:15:04] [clears throat]
[1:15:05] And what happens? Uh all of a sudden I'm
[1:15:08] getting
[1:15:10] I'm I'm going to lay down my pride here.
[1:15:13] It was uh Joshua at Jericho or Gideon.
[1:15:18] Joshua. Thank you. See, just smack the
[1:15:21] devil right in the head. I'm going to
[1:15:23] lay down my pride and I'm going to find
[1:15:24] out the answers. Yet, I I get
[1:15:27] embarrassed when these things happen.
[1:15:29] When my thoughts start to get blurred,
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about, but I my
[1:15:34] thoughts start getting blurred and I get
[1:15:35] embarrassed and I thought, I've learned
[1:15:38] Satan just get away. What's the answer
[1:15:40] to this? Okay, now we can go on. Joshua
[1:15:43] was standing there and see the point is
[1:15:46] is that uh this angel brother Benham
[1:15:49] said there was an angel leaning against
[1:15:51] the wall with a sword in his hand
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; and Joshua came up to him and says are
[1:15:55] you for us or are you for our adversary
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; and he says I'm none I am the captain of
[1:16:02] the Lord of hosts
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; and what he was saying he says I am the
[1:16:06] captain of Israel you did not cross
[1:16:09] Jordan brotherham says that that a uh
[1:16:11] that angel was Jesus Christ.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see THAT? THEY DIDN'T
[1:16:16] CROSS OVER THE JORDAN uh on their own.
[1:16:18] It was that angel that brought them
[1:16:20] across the Jordan. I am the captain. I
[1:16:23] brought you across the Jordan. I brought
[1:16:25] you through the waters of Myra. I was
[1:16:27] the one that was with you at that time.
[1:16:29] I was with Abraham when he came out of
[1:16:31] Caldes. I was with with this one when
[1:16:34] they were doing that. I was with this
[1:16:35] one. I am the captain of the host.
[1:16:39] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And the
[1:16:41] captain of the host is here now.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; AND HE WALKS AMONGST US. AND IT IS JESUS
[1:16:46] CHRIST.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; HE'S STANDING THERE WITH HIS sword in
[1:16:49] his HAND WAITING TO CHOP EVERY DEVIL TO
[1:16:51] PIECES.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; OH, praise the name of the Lord. TO KNOW
[1:16:54] THAT THAT LIVING JESUS CHRIST is here
[1:16:57] amongst us just as well.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. NOW AFTER THE DEATH OF
[1:17:01] JOSHUA WHERE WE COME TO A TIME THERE WAS
[1:17:03] A GENERATION that rose up that did not
[1:17:06] know God and did not know the works of
[1:17:10] God. And I am believing today that we're
[1:17:12] in that type of generation. Though we're
[1:17:15] in the message, CHILDREN HAVE GROWN UP
[1:17:17] IN THE MESSAGE BUT DO NOT KNOW THE works
[1:17:20] of God nor of the knowing God himself.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AMEN. PRAISE THE LORD. BUT
[1:17:28] THE THING of it is Jesus Christ is the
[1:17:31] same yesterday, today and
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE COME THIS FAR ONLY BY THE GRACE
[1:17:38] of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; There are many things we can talk about.
[1:17:43] We can get into uh uh uh talking about
[1:17:47] the seven seals and the seven church
[1:17:49] ages and many different things that we
[1:17:51] could we could talk about. But friends,
[1:17:54] YOU IF WE CANNOT LIVE A simple Christian
[1:17:57] life,
[1:17:59] ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS don't mean
[1:18:00] anything.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; If we can sit down and explain all the
[1:18:07] details about the message and you don't
[1:18:10] have victory in your life,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; it's no good.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; As I've been talking here, maybe you're
[1:18:16] thinking, "Well, Brother Ry's preaching
[1:18:17] a very simple message today. Did you
[1:18:21] want something complicated?
[1:18:24] Did you want something uh something that
[1:18:26] takes us that deep far into the message
[1:18:29] or or something like that? What were you
[1:18:31] looking for?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; But you see, just to get something to
[1:18:35] give you something that will reach into
[1:18:37] your heart that you'll go home say,
[1:18:39] "Lord,
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; I want to be a soldier for God.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; I want to be a soldier in this message.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be like these people
[1:18:47] that [clears throat] came out and come
[1:18:48] into coming to the promised land and
[1:18:50] they're so weak. You know, when they
[1:18:52] brought the uh evidence back, evidence
[1:18:55] back from the promised land and here the
[1:18:58] evidence was there. Those 10 spies did
[1:19:00] not look at that evidence. They only
[1:19:02] looked at the giants in the land.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; And today, people do not look at the
[1:19:07] evidence in the in the in the message.
[1:19:10] They don't look where the people have
[1:19:12] raised from the dead. They don't look
[1:19:14] the critics don't look at uh the
[1:19:16] healings that have taken place and all
[1:19:18] the events that have happened. They're
[1:19:20] not looking at that. THEY ONLY CAN FIND
[1:19:23] SOME CRITICISM about the message.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; They're not looking at the evidence. And
[1:19:28] friends, God has given us so much
[1:19:32] evidence.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO WALK WITH GOD.
[1:19:36] [screaming]
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD IN THIS DAY, WE SHOULD LIFT
[1:19:40] OUR HANDS UH ON THE BASIS. LORD, YOU'RE
[1:19:45] STILL A LIVING GOD. You're still so
[1:19:48] gracious and powerful, LORD. OUR OUR
[1:19:52] SICKNESS IS HEALED. OUR DELIVERANCE IS
[1:19:55] THERE, LORD. EVERYTHING THAT WAS IS
[1:19:57] STILL HERE AND YOU'RE WALKING AMONGST
[1:20:00] US, LORD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR loving
[1:20:03] us.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; We should HAVE SUCH A A RELATIONSHIP
[1:20:07] WITH JESUS. Brother Benham says in a
[1:20:09] ministry called fellowship, he said when
[1:20:12] men uh lost their fellowship with God,
[1:20:14] they become a wanderer. And we've have
[1:20:16] too many wanderers in the message. We're
[1:20:19] wandering around and don't know what
[1:20:21] we're doing. We should have purpose in
[1:20:23] our life. I want to be like Jesus.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; I want to be uh walk in that same power
[1:20:29] and that same glory. I WANT TO BE WHAT
[1:20:31] HE WANTS.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. [applause] Can I
[1:20:35] ask that the instruments would come?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to his name.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the name
[1:20:46] of Jesus.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:51] Hallelujah.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; There's so many things we can speak. You
[1:20:56] know,
[1:20:57] after studying the message for for for
[1:21:01] so many years
[1:21:03] and I come to the pulpit, what what am I
[1:21:05] going to tell the people? What what am I
[1:21:07] going to talk about?
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; But what I want to do, I want to give
[1:21:12] you something that can help you. Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Look, we got young people sitting here.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; What are you going to talk to them about
[1:21:20] the seals?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; We talk to them about the seven
[1:21:24] churches. They don't know anything much
[1:21:26] about those kind of things. But if I can
[1:21:29] give you something that everybody can
[1:21:32] relate to
[1:21:35] that is so important.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Anybody been sick and party in the last
[1:21:42] couple of days? Anybody been sick
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; here? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We're going to
[1:21:48] pray for you. We're not going to have a
[1:21:49] prayer line, but we're going to pray for
[1:21:51] you.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; When we pray, you want to take God's
[1:21:55] word. [applause]
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; You're healing now.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. You can play something soft. I
[1:22:02] appreciate that.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; You want to take God at his word.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're going to finish this today.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; When I go home, I'm not going to wrestle
[1:22:16] anymore.
[1:22:18] [music]
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; You might, one of you might say, well,
[1:22:25] brother, I don't have any issues in my
[1:22:27] life.
[1:22:29] [music] And you can just turn to the
[1:22:30] Lord say, Lord, I am so grateful for
[1:22:33] what you have done for me.
[1:22:36] You called me out, Lord.
[1:22:40] I'm only sitting here today because of
[1:22:43] your grace. [music]
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; I'm only sitting here because I love you
[1:22:49] so much, Lord. [music] You have done so
[1:22:51] much for me. Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you for what you've done for
[1:22:56] [music] me, Jesus.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:23:01] [music]
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; That songwriter that wrote the song,
[1:23:05] Amazing Grace, he had a [music] real
[1:23:07] revelation. Amazing grace. How sweet
[1:23:12] the sound [music]
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; that saved a wretch like me.
