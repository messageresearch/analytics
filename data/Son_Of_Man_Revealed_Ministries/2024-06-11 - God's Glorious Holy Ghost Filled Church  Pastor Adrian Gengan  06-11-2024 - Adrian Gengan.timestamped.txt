[2:23] all in the precious name of our Lord and
[2:25] Savior Jesus Christ amen amen Our God
[2:28] who is worthy of praise yes amen amen
[2:33] hallelujah amen so there's so much we
[2:35] can talk about amen but when we talk
[2:39] about him he's the all consuming one
[2:41] amen he fills us up so let's just get to
[2:44] the word of God we'll read our scripture
[2:46] you can have your seats let's go to
[2:48] Ephesians chap
[2:51] 5:25 it's maybe too loud for me I start
[2:54] screaming
[2:55] you amen Ephesians 5:25
[3:02] husbands love your
[3:04] wives even as Christ also loved the
[3:07] church now he's going to go into why
[3:08] Christ loved the church even as Christ
[3:11] also loved the church and gave himself
[3:14] for
[3:15] it amen amen so Christ's love was a
[3:18] sacrificial love yes that he might
[3:21] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[3:24] of Water by the word amen so remember
[3:27] the holy ghost at this time being poured
[3:28] out is by the word
[3:30] to receive the word for your age amen
[3:33] the prophet says that's your
[3:34] identification that you have the Seal of
[3:36] God which is the Holy Ghost amen so he's
[3:39] sending the word to sanctify and cleanse
[3:41] it to this bride why he wants to present
[3:45] that he might present
[3:47] it to himself a glorious church amen not
[3:52] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[3:56] but that it should be holy and without
[3:58] blemish amen the L A blessings to the
[4:00] reading of his word you may be
[4:02] seated let's go to the book of St
[4:04] [Music]
[4:13] [Music]
[4:15] John St John chapter
[4:17] 14 Hallelujah we read from verse
[4:21] 12 verily verily I say unto you he that
[4:26] believeth on me the works that I do
[4:29] shall he do also amen amen and Greater
[4:34] Works than these shall he do because I
[4:37] go unto my
[4:39] father amen what a
[4:42] promise amen now that are to fill every
[4:46] son and daughter of God with an
[4:49] expectation because if we reading the
[4:52] Bible and we are seeing the mighty works
[4:54] that Jesus Christ had done if we reading
[4:57] with just a denominational mind
[5:00] or just a natural conception you can
[5:03] Marvel at the mighty works that Jesus
[5:07] did but here Jesus is turning it back
[5:09] around to us and saying you are going to
[5:11] do Greater Works amen amen amen because
[5:15] I'm going to my father praise the Lord
[5:19] now one would think that's impossible to
[5:21] do but then if Jesus says something he's
[5:25] going to back it up amen amen amen he's
[5:27] going to equip his church
[5:30] if he's going to have a glorious Church
[5:32] he's got to give her the material to
[5:34] equip her and make her into this amen
[5:37] now we can't leave scriptures
[5:39] unfulfilled the prophet of God in
[5:41] telling us this is's telling us that
[5:42] when Jesus Christ came he was the
[5:44] manifestation of God in
[5:47] flesh and all that was in God he poured
[5:49] into Christ yes and all that was in
[5:52] Christ he now is poured into his church
[5:54] amen amen hallelujah so there's got to
[5:57] be he left us with an expectation
[6:01] amen Jesus Christ left us with an
[6:05] expectation amen now if Jesus Christ
[6:08] healed the sick heal the blind the mute
[6:12] the deaf the
[6:14] crippled the expectation that he leaves
[6:17] with us is that you're going to do
[6:18] Greater Works than
[6:20] these amen amen yes hallelujah thank you
[6:24] Lord now the prophet of God is telling
[6:26] us that Jesus Christ won't leave if
[6:29] doesn't do the same things that he's
[6:31] doing back in the Bible days here again
[6:34] then he's not fully manifesting his word
[6:37] he says if there is no manifestation
[6:39] because remember everything you hear
[6:41] Jesus say we must say
[6:43] amen amen that's right because Jesus
[6:46] came to show us the Adam man so when
[6:48] Jesus is telling them if you don't
[6:50] believe me my message I'm preaching now
[6:53] we have a message as John the bride if
[6:55] you don't believe me believe the works
[6:57] that I do amen amen so we we can't be
[7:00] that group of people who are saying only
[7:02] believe what we are
[7:04] professing right we can speak the same
[7:06] words of Jesus and say if you don't
[7:08] believe the words that I saying believe
[7:10] me for the very
[7:12] Works amen for I am come out of Jesus
[7:15] Jesus said he was come out of the father
[7:17] but the bride can now say for I am come
[7:19] out of the sight of Jesus as a
[7:23] manifestation amen praise the Lord so
[7:25] amen just to give it a title amen
[7:27] because these things go on YouTube God's
[7:29] glorious holy ghost fill church amen
[7:32] that's what he's looking for a glorious
[7:34] holy ghost fill church now sometimes the
[7:38] main thing we leave out looking for
[7:41] other promises but yet it's so simple
[7:43] and it's in the main thing amen now if
[7:46] God is going to equip a church he's
[7:48] going to send the Holy Ghost to equip
[7:49] the church right amen so we we're
[7:52] looking around now and we can see that
[7:54] world events are transpiring at a rapid
[7:56] rate amen just today
[8:00] or yesterday maybe you know that the
[8:02] prime minister of Israel he dismissed or
[8:04] he fired the defense minister amen and
[8:08] upon reading further into it amen the
[8:10] defense minister was the one who is in
[8:13] charge of the military tactics of the
[8:15] country
[8:16] yes and he is concerned Amen to protect
[8:19] Israel he is their main Defender right
[8:24] so the Prime Minister didn't want to
[8:26] agree to certain things that this
[8:27] Minister was doing and one of the things
[8:29] was he didn't this Minister of Defense
[8:32] wants
[8:34] all to enlist in the Army all illegible
[8:38] yes whether you're Orthodox or
[8:41] not now remember we got Orthodox message
[8:44] people
[8:46] too we got
[8:49] Orthodox and we got the regular ones
[8:53] right now I think it's
[8:56] significant he said everyone must enlist
[8:59] if you're elgible to enlist in the Army
[9:01] Israel is at War we need you to come
[9:03] into the army and every we been
[9:06] preaching that everyone must come into
[9:08] the army of Jesus Christ we can't have
[9:10] people living civilian lives and the
[9:11] others are in the army of Christ all
[9:14] must come in and net doesn't want to
[9:17] agree to that and he's defending the
[9:19] Orthodox Jews and he doesn't want them
[9:20] to
[9:21] enlist so that became a contention the
[9:24] other contention is he's saying you
[9:27] destroyed Gaz and there's no longer to
[9:28] keep fighting in G
[9:29] move to the sides of the
[9:31] [Music]
[9:32] north he says take out your your
[9:35] greatest enemy first which is esbah
[9:37] rather than focusing on a mass which is
[9:39] like a finished organization right
[9:42] now amen now watch strategically in the
[9:45] natural how it's happening and watch
[9:47] because we know that the that the attack
[9:49] upon the bride is coming from the sides
[9:50] of the north he wants to sit upon the
[9:53] Mount of the congregation on the sides
[9:55] of the
[9:56] north so here he is trying to to give
[10:01] advice but they see it as a conflict and
[10:04] he says we can't see eye to eye I'm
[10:06] going to dismiss you amen so don't be
[10:10] dismissive of the Holy Spirit when he's
[10:13] bringing in a work amen if he is telling
[10:16] you get your greatest enemy
[10:20] first amen hallelujah the prophet of God
[10:24] yeah in the message believest thou this
[10:25] he says it's the Jews time right it's
[10:28] the Jews time right at hand
[10:32] now and the Gentiles are ending
[10:35] out because they just went on
[10:38] out they rejecting Christ they're
[10:41] rejecting their signs they're rejecting
[10:44] everything that's called Godly and
[10:47] branded as some kind of telepathy or
[10:50] devil
[10:51] power they're blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[10:54] and sealing themselves away from God and
[10:57] God will take that Minority
[10:59] after a while and will raise it up into
[11:02] a powerful church
[11:05] amen and then turn the spirit to the
[11:10] Jews now we can't say that God has
[11:12] stopped working with the church right
[11:15] because we've seen a powerful Prophet I
[11:18] don't if you can say we've seen a
[11:19] powerful
[11:20] Prophet but have we really seen that
[11:23] powerful
[11:25] church amen now remember he says Christ
[11:28] in the true church will will be a
[11:30] continuation of the book of Acts but a
[11:34] continuation doesn't mean a mimic yes it
[11:39] means it will continue meaning it will
[11:42] progress amen yes because the greater
[11:44] the Revelation the greater the Power
[11:46] released to the
[11:48] church amen praise the Lord so our
[11:51] expectation is higher amen so he says he
[11:54] going to take this minority group and
[11:55] raise it into a powerful church and then
[11:58] turn the spirits to the Jews and take
[12:00] the Gentile Church home she is in the
[12:03] making now well we're at the end time
[12:06] nearly now he's saying that in 60s that
[12:08] we're nearly at the end time amen praise
[12:10] the Lord so if God now remember when God
[12:13] was fully expressed to Jesus he left us
[12:15] with a promise that the church is going
[12:17] to do Greater
[12:19] Works right that was the son of man
[12:22] everybody agreed Jesus was the son of
[12:24] man now in re in in the Book of Luke
[12:27] 17:30 he telling you even thus shall it
[12:30] be in the days when the son of man is
[12:32] revealed yes so the prophet of God would
[12:35] tell us that he was a son of man
[12:37] revealing the son of man yes amen
[12:41] everybody's following when you're
[12:42] looking at the prophet and his his
[12:44] powerful anointing that's upon Him amen
[12:47] that is Christ in brother Brandon amen
[12:51] yes it is a son of man that's revealing
[12:53] the son of man am that's why he can
[12:55] stand with his back turned to the
[12:56] audience and discern them again showing
[12:59] it's Genesis 18 Again yes it's God in
[13:02] flesh again that's right amen okay but
[13:04] follow the train of thought when he goes
[13:06] off the scene there's got to be a group
[13:08] of people that come in after him and
[13:11] Greater Works than these shall he do
[13:13] amen because it's the same son of man
[13:15] that just left the Earth yeah yes thank
[13:18] you
[13:21] amen so his message you'll find
[13:25] here the prophet I'm I'm going to read a
[13:27] bit here and tell you he says the only
[13:31] way we can make meaningful purposeful
[13:34] contribution into the kingdom of God is
[13:36] through the Holy Ghost amen amen amen
[13:39] not of our own merits
[13:41] now we we can only make meaningful
[13:44] contributions to the kingdom of God
[13:46] through the Holy Ghost amen outside of
[13:49] the Holy Ghost it's our own ability
[13:51] trying to follow a
[13:55] religion he makes a powerful statement
[13:57] sh in the Statue of a perfect man he
[14:00] says Christ never sent me to build
[14:03] organization so he never sent brother
[14:05] Brandon to build a messy
[14:08] Church Christ sent me to build
[14:10] individuals to the statue of Jesus
[14:14] Christ that they might be the PowerHouse
[14:17] and the dwelling place of the spirit now
[14:20] it doesn't stop there I'm going to go
[14:22] into
[14:23] this every one of us must be a
[14:27] Powerhouse that Dwelling Place of the
[14:30] holy spirit amen how is he doing it he's
[14:33] got a comma and he says by his word
[14:37] glory
[14:40] amen because if we are feeling like the
[14:42] opening of the word came and we can't
[14:44] see the effect of it or the purpose of
[14:46] it you're missing the point of brother
[14:48] brandham coming with a message because
[14:51] by the word he's going to build a
[14:53] Powerhouse he's going to build the
[14:55] individual up so that is why we've got
[14:58] to keep feeding on the word he says
[15:00] you're not feeding on the words of a man
[15:03] you're feeding on the body word of the
[15:05] son of man yes Hallelujah he says by his
[15:09] word see build the individual to that
[15:13] place amen so we can't get to be a
[15:16] powerful Army a glorious Church without
[15:18] the word yes the purpose of sending the
[15:21] word amen is to raise up this powerful
[15:24] Army amen but then we shouldn't amen we
[15:27] shouldn't belittle the word or and push
[15:29] it aside and say there's no meaning or
[15:31] no effect right especially when brother
[15:34] Bram labeled so much Amen in the early
[15:37] days and he says it wasn't in the early
[15:39] years of going out in the evangelism
[15:41] field and The Healing Ministry he said
[15:43] it was when I came with a
[15:45] message so which means it's the opening
[15:47] of the word amen it's the revelation of
[15:49] the Seven Seals amen it's the revelation
[15:51] of the church ages and all of these
[15:53] wonderful truths that we have Christ The
[15:55] Mystery of God revealed it takes the
[15:57] entire word now to build faith in a
[16:01] people amen amen so what is that the
[16:05] Holy Ghost working through the
[16:07] word
[16:10] amen so remember we are individuals
[16:13] being built into a Powerhouse of God not
[16:15] to build an organization to a greater
[16:18] denomination but to build individuals to
[16:21] Sons and Daughters of God that's the
[16:25] idea right add to your faith virtue
[16:28] virtue knowledge well now we are coming
[16:31] to a place he says when we begin to say
[16:34] we don't have to accept that today he
[16:37] says you do have to it must
[16:41] be now I'm asking us because we all
[16:44] interested parties here amen we all say
[16:46] we believe the word of God this word
[16:49] that we say we believe how much of time
[16:52] are we spending with the word of God
[16:54] Amen that's right amen hallelujah amen
[16:58] Maybe if I ask you to preach you might
[17:01] take time to go and study and read a
[17:03] scripture read some scriptures to gather
[17:06] a thought build a sermon around it but
[17:09] our our study of the word and our
[17:11] reading of the word should not be just
[17:13] for platform
[17:15] performance
[17:17] yes there's got to be a time of
[17:19] meditation a time where we can spend
[17:21] reading the word amen amen a time of
[17:24] personal growth if we are thinking that
[17:27] we we're only going to set aside a
[17:28] Sunday or a wedes day for spiritual
[17:30] growth we are going to be
[17:33] defeated amen this should be the
[17:38] Overflow we talk about overflow yes our
[17:41] reading the word and our prayer time and
[17:43] our worship time the Sunday morning and
[17:45] the Wednesday should be our overflow the
[17:48] extra amen thank you Lord it should not
[17:51] be our filling portion right amen amen
[17:55] hallelujah so we we are the most
[17:57] privileged people in the FI face of the
[17:59] Earth to have the books and the tapes in
[18:01] all formats yes right it's at the tip of
[18:05] our finger amen it's at
[18:07] the it's at our
[18:10] fingertips amen we have full access to
[18:13] it but I'm asking you again how much of
[18:15] time do we really spend with it because
[18:19] that will determine how much of value we
[18:21] place on
[18:21] [Music]
[18:23] it
[18:24] amen now the purpose of me asking that
[18:27] question is not to bring condemnation
[18:29] but he should really look and see hey
[18:31] I'm not doing that which means that
[18:36] would supposed to be our first love our
[18:38] our first love is being
[18:40] removed yes that which was sent to give
[18:42] us faith for Rapture our focus is taken
[18:46] away amen praise the Lord amen he says
[18:50] there's always been something about the
[18:52] church that isn't just exactly right cuz
[18:55] we know that's the devil it seems like
[18:58] there's been a lacking somewhere among
[19:00] the people I have my own ideas and we
[19:04] have beat at the bridge and beat these
[19:07] walls as hard as we could but yet in all
[19:10] of it we've been unsuccessful to Beat
[19:12] Down the Walls of the
[19:14] opposition yet I'm so glad that we got
[19:16] some bomb holes in it
[19:18] anyhow that someday this Great Wall of
[19:21] indifference amongst the people will
[19:22] fall down and God's Great United Army
[19:26] will March in one great Forefront with
[19:28] one one great Banner of the Lord Jesus
[19:30] Christ Hallelujah that's my sincere hope
[19:33] amen amen so as hard as we've been
[19:35] preaching amen since last year since
[19:37] this year maybe amen we haven't made
[19:39] much impact to tear down walls but I
[19:41] pray amen we've we've sent enough bombs
[19:43] to at least blast some holes into it
[19:46] amen to there some stirring of the
[19:48] moving of the spirit amen you've
[19:50] probably seen some sort of spiritual
[19:52] growth within your life but I'm asking
[19:54] us let's press forward amen let's give
[19:56] more let's surrender more yes amen
[20:01] amen the prophet is saying now and I'm
[20:03] driving a point with this God intended
[20:05] the church to be a powerful
[20:09] Church a glorious church amen a church
[20:13] that the whole world could look upon as
[20:16] a bride of Christ well accepted and
[20:18] espoused and to live in such an
[20:20] atmosphere and conduct itself in such a
[20:23] way that God would be proud of this
[20:25] church to present you to Christ at the
[20:27] coming of the Lord
[20:29] amen now who can say that we have
[20:35] arrived who can say we have arrived
[20:37] there he says God intended this church
[20:39] to be a powerful Church a glorious
[20:42] Church a church that the whole world
[20:44] could look upon as a
[20:47] bride you know what we hear this is what
[20:50] we hear when somebody from the outside
[20:52] looks in brother Bram was such a
[20:54] powerful man of
[20:55] God right he moved in the prophetic he
[20:58] moved in the miraculous signs and
[21:00] wonders we know that he walked with
[21:02] Christ even TL Osborne says when I saw
[21:04] that man I saw Jesus
[21:08] Christ you know what they
[21:10] say we saw God Walk Through This Man
[21:14] what happened to the message church
[21:17] right that's right whereas now you what
[21:21] he's saying again he's saying he wants
[21:23] the whole world to see the bride of
[21:25] Christ amen amen
[21:29] I I I really think that the message
[21:31] church is settled for religion that's
[21:34] right that's
[21:36] true we're happy to come to church on a
[21:38] Sunday and a wedness day and we are safe
[21:41] in our comfort zone thinking the message
[21:43] is right and I'm safe there's no uh
[21:46] nothing required on my
[21:49] part
[21:51] amen but they if we if we really are
[21:55] honest with ourselves we'll know there's
[21:56] something lacking amen
[21:59] amen he says but we find out many times
[22:02] that with good intentions that people
[22:04] are trying to make themselves act like
[22:07] Christians they're trying to say well I
[22:09] know I am thus and I must live this way
[22:12] now if the church could not look at it
[22:14] that way God never intended Christianity
[22:18] to be governed by denominations neither
[22:20] by Creeds if God only allowed or
[22:23] intended for the church to be governed
[22:26] by Creeds denominations and
[22:28] intellectuals then we do not need the
[22:30] holy spirit in the church that's
[22:34] right I'm going to make a statement I
[22:36] think that the Holy
[22:39] Ghost is not welcome in most
[22:44] churches we have a program that we want
[22:46] to run yes we have men preaching that's
[22:50] not seeking the Holy Ghost for word that
[22:52] is present tense right amen
[22:56] hallelujah we can we can easily go into
[22:59] the messages and pull out any portion
[23:01] and come and people will be satisfied if
[23:03] we read quotes the entire
[23:06] service with no Holy Ghost conviction
[23:09] right amen praise the
[23:12] Lord you know in every in every area of
[23:15] study there is a there is a theory part
[23:18] that's right and and I know in the last
[23:20] two weeks I've really been preaching the
[23:22] theory of faith hope and charity but
[23:25] I've got to lay the mechanics before we
[23:27] can get into the
[23:29] Dynamics amen teaching is very important
[23:33] I'm trying to show you through the
[23:34] scriptures
[23:35] first about faith hope and
[23:38] charity before you can start to see it
[23:40] practically in our lives remember
[23:43] whatever we're preaching now is to equip
[23:44] you to that powerful Church yes it's not
[23:46] for Theory so we are preaching the
[23:49] mechanics of it yeah the mechanics but I
[23:52] tell you so that the Holy Ghost can move
[23:54] upon it in the Dynamics and bring it to
[23:56] life in your in your own personal life
[23:58] amen and you're going to see
[24:00] it yes Lord you're going to see a shift
[24:04] in the church in your life when you can
[24:07] apply these
[24:08] truths amen amen hallelujah the Holy
[24:11] Ghost is going to go into some things to
[24:13] take you into high dimensions of himself
[24:15] amen amen because the Holy Ghost can't
[24:18] exist outside of your body amen the Holy
[24:21] Ghost was meant to to empower You by
[24:24] coming into you amen amen the Holy Ghost
[24:27] can't empow EMP power you amen he can
[24:30] Empower you to a certain level by coming
[24:32] on your flesh you can jump you can shout
[24:34] you can sing you can move you can
[24:37] dance but he can only have a certain
[24:39] work there he can come upon your spirit
[24:42] amen he can have a certain work there
[24:45] but unless he gets into that genius
[24:47] Soul that's where he can have the most
[24:49] powerful
[24:51] influence amen
[24:53] hallelujah I I'm not going to be too
[24:55] long amen because it's our Wednesday
[24:56] night prayer meeting I intend to finish
[24:58] very shortly amen so catch while the
[25:00] spirit is speaking amen amen and I am
[25:04] saying amen we we need to move into this
[25:06] Dimension now right we can't be
[25:09] satisfied in living you know like a
[25:12] batted eagle flying in low
[25:14] altitudes amen
[25:20] amen right we don't want religion amen
[25:23] amen we don't want to be in the safety
[25:26] of our walls
[25:28] right no we are we why why do you think
[25:31] we are there's a cry and a groan pushing
[25:34] out prayer meeting all night prayer
[25:37] meeting amen more of the spirit of God
[25:41] more of this Lord Jesus I tell you
[25:43] what's consuming us we are satisfied
[25:46] just chasing money you know when God
[25:49] When God says that you can't serve God
[25:53] and he doesn't say the devil right
[25:58] because you'll either serve God or
[25:59] you'll go chasing
[26:01] money and all of us go to work for what
[26:04] because you love your
[26:06] boss you love the people that you work
[26:09] with what are you
[26:11] chasing you are chasing that
[26:14] money right now to chase that money you
[26:18] will not miss
[26:21] work you will not miss
[26:23] work you will miss church but you will
[26:26] not miss work
[26:29] so where who Do You Love
[26:32] More who do we love
[26:35] more amen
[26:38] amen what do we where are Works
[26:42] concentrated more so if we're putting
[26:44] God here and money here in all our
[26:47] activity for 30 days where is most of
[26:50] our energy and
[26:52] focus is it upon the
[26:55] money or is it upon God
[26:59] now remember you can have
[27:01] both because the the common thing is oh
[27:04] Lord if you only give me more time no
[27:06] but but if God gave you 10
[27:09] minutes what are you doing with that 10
[27:11] minutes Lord if you only give me a
[27:13] certain thing I will go across the world
[27:15] but you can't go across the
[27:18] street Lord if I only had an hour but
[27:21] you got 10
[27:22] minutes and we're doing nothing with it
[27:26] so I know you know these things I'm just
[27:28] showing you God's principles are this
[27:31] that amen he wants us to be accountable
[27:33] amen because he's a God who demands
[27:36] return amen he's a God who loves
[27:38] investment and he loves return Yes you
[27:41] know the story about the talents he's a
[27:43] God who loves investment and he's a God
[27:46] who loves
[27:48] returns amen praise the Lord amen so in
[27:53] all that we are doing let us be good
[27:54] stewards amen the most powerful message
[27:58] to make us the most powerful
[28:00] church yet there's a there's a
[28:03] disconnect you know what it is it's a
[28:06] bad
[28:08] connection when you don't have good
[28:10] connection you don't get good
[28:12] signal when you got a te the cable the
[28:15] current is not flowing properly amen
[28:18] you're losing current praise the Lord
[28:21] let's move now to finish now amen
[28:23] hallelujah
[28:31] he says in the word I find that God did
[28:33] not intend the church to be governed by
[28:35] intellectual or by the Theology of man
[28:38] but by the Holy Spirit was given to the
[28:40] church to govern and control the body of
[28:43] Christ now may be thinking that that
[28:46] sounds too
[28:49] simple he's saying the Holy Ghost was
[28:51] sent to govern and control the body of
[28:56] Christ and I think in doing that with
[28:59] that in mind and in God's program we
[29:01] will never be successful no matter how
[29:04] good our intentions are until we get
[29:06] back into the center of God's program
[29:08] where the holy spirit
[29:12] amen
[29:15] amen so we can't mix intellectuals with
[29:18] the word amen he says when the Holy
[29:22] Spirit desires to do a thing and degrade
[29:24] something or lift something up it causes
[29:27] petty jealousy among the people which
[29:29] proves they haven't got the Holy Spirit
[29:32] every man would want to be in his place
[29:35] now in this the people as a reason
[29:37] because they've seen so many
[29:39] denominations different dictators as it
[29:41] was and he he says it your spiritual
[29:44] dictators in the
[29:47] church but the Holy Ghost has placed
[29:50] each one into the body of Christ and we
[29:52] are helpless to maneuver without every
[29:54] member of the body we have to have my
[29:57] hands my arms my mouth my eyes
[30:00] everything that's in me has to operate
[30:03] and make my body function
[30:06] perfectly and then if God wanted his
[30:08] body the church to be governed by this
[30:10] by his Spirit there's got to be some way
[30:14] or some program that we've got to enter
[30:16] into that other than what we already
[30:18] have am so we're driving to a point now
[30:22] to show you how is God going to get this
[30:24] church a powerful Church how is God
[30:26] going to get a super Church how is God
[30:28] going to get make us a Powerhouse of
[30:32] God it's the main
[30:35] thing it's the thing that we need to ask
[30:37] ourselves even as many years as we've
[30:39] been in the message have you received
[30:41] the Holy Ghost since you believed
[30:44] amen thank you Lord amen let's start
[30:47] with that
[30:48] question I want you to think about this
[30:51] right now and ask yourself have I
[30:53] received the Holy Ghost since I believed
[31:00] amen he says shame on you who profess to
[31:02] be Christian and rely on such things for
[31:05] Joy when the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost
[31:07] Gospel is nothing but one big Power
[31:09] House of Joy the Holy Ghost is a perfect
[31:13] intoxication for every man that's got
[31:15] the blues you will take a drink of the
[31:17] Gospel of Jesus Christ be filled with
[31:19] the Holy Ghost you are drunk until you
[31:21] leave this world joy unspeakable and
[31:24] full of Glory a constant stimulation
[31:28] constant intoxication drunk day and
[31:31] night that's the word of God Amen now
[31:34] watch now he's not separating the holy
[31:36] ghost from the word of
[31:42] God
[31:49] Amen he says if you can see God moving
[31:51] in the church listen to how he says this
[31:54] now and I want you to catch this
[31:56] church I really want you to catch it
[31:58] because we are moving in a direction
[32:01] where amen from this direction we are
[32:04] talking about moving into an Enoch walk
[32:06] and from an Enoch walk we have to leave
[32:08] this
[32:09] world Amen so I really want you to catch
[32:12] what he's saying he says the church is
[32:14] supposed to be predestinated unto
[32:16] adoption of
[32:19] children where God can take a man and
[32:22] adopt him into the family give him
[32:25] something
[32:28] that first try that and see if it's
[32:30] right the Bible said try the spirit this
[32:33] man claims a certain thing try it and
[32:35] see if it's right if it's right move
[32:38] right with it
[32:41] amen thank you Lord amen if Exodus 23:23
[32:45] is right the angel of God leading the
[32:46] church and if you determine it is right
[32:48] then move with it in the Third Exodus
[32:50] amen amen
[32:52] hallelujah amen
[32:55] yes then say Lord send us something else
[33:00] see he says don't be satisfied with that
[33:01] one thing Lord send us something else
[33:04] keep moving see just keep moving till
[33:07] every fellow takes his place then you're
[33:09] going to see the Church of God begin to
[33:11] get its place amen
[33:15] amen amen the time of us thinking that
[33:18] everything I want to place it upon the
[33:20] ministry is over the ministry wants to
[33:23] place it back on you amen because the
[33:25] ministry needs to see you develop into
[33:27] your full potential
[33:28] amen hallelujah the ministry amen can be
[33:31] at R when you become the super church
[33:33] and the super race when you are the ones
[33:35] going two by two amen going into the
[33:37] streets amen going and ministering to
[33:39] people
[33:41] amenah let me ask you in your circle of
[33:43] friends and families do you see people
[33:45] that need to be ministered to people
[33:47] that are hurting that are broken how
[33:50] about we start there with the evangelism
[33:51] tool amen and say Brothers this person
[33:54] you know they are most open to you
[33:56] because they they trust you
[33:58] that's right and when they down and and
[34:00] maybe need help amen tell them can I get
[34:02] the brothers to come and pray for
[34:05] you can I get them to come and witness
[34:07] to you we we trying to go out amen and
[34:10] blast them with speakers and they but
[34:12] they in our own circles there may be
[34:14] people in
[34:16] need I saying we have resources and
[34:19] we're not using them that's right amen
[34:21] because now we are ashamed we don't want
[34:24] everybody around us to think we are too
[34:25] spiritual
[34:29] amen the first thing you should say when
[34:31] somebody is telling you something he's
[34:32] not hey I know this doctor and I know
[34:34] this person and I know this person can
[34:36] help
[34:37] you you should go spiritual first amen
[34:40] amen you should Ascend the spiritual
[34:42] realm first amen amen and I I really
[34:46] want you to take that to heart amen amen
[34:50] because you can put the ministry to work
[34:52] you can put the brothers to work
[34:56] amen but as as long as we leave it up
[34:58] now to the ministry and let them carry
[35:00] on whatever they do is fine leave me and
[35:03] my family
[35:04] alone what we are finding is families
[35:06] are not growing spiritually yes that's
[35:09] right
[35:10] amen families are not growing
[35:12] spiritually they're coming to church
[35:14] week after week they're not growing
[35:17] spiritually because there's no
[35:19] implementation of what they hearing from
[35:21] the pulpit into their
[35:23] homes amen at home they allowed to live
[35:26] any kind of lives do any kind of things
[35:28] but here amen there's an expectation
[35:29] when they come to church so I'm saying
[35:32] we don't want that kind of religion
[35:34] that's so let's keep moving amen we got
[35:38] to keep he says get the Philistines to
[35:41] back off he says the shorts will go off
[35:43] the hair will grow down faces will be
[35:45] washed cigars missing when the church
[35:48] begins to get into its Mighty power when
[35:50] we have an an and Safa and a few of them
[35:53] you'll see when the Holy Ghost Church
[35:55] stands together in his power
[35:57] positionally placed as sons of God
[35:59] adopted into the family of God powerful
[36:01] Church standing there in its Glory oh
[36:03] that's what he's coming for Hallelujah
[36:06] I'll close with this quote now amen it's
[36:09] 5 minutes past 8 and we need to start
[36:11] praying amen he says now listen to this
[36:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts God
[36:16] back in man
[36:18] am
[36:20] Hallelujah now if you can only digest
[36:23] what he is saying there how can he put
[36:26] something back into you meaning it was
[36:28] there in the
[36:29] beginning
[36:33] amen okayy so what did Adam really lose
[36:36] yes amen we we say it uh uh how can I
[36:40] say out of intellect Adam lost the
[36:43] book what do you mean you had one
[36:48] book remember man's original Spirit was
[36:51] the Holy Spirit right amen God was
[36:54] condescending yeah right amen
[36:59] so he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:01] puts God back in man amen I can just
[37:05] read that and meditate on that for hours
[37:08] yes the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts
[37:11] God back in man then I can go to Genesis
[37:14] I can think I can think on the lives of
[37:17] all the prophets he says it was Christ
[37:19] in Moses Christ in Noah yes Christ in
[37:23] the prophets the the
[37:24] psalmist and I can look at the life of

[37:30] the life of brother Brandon God back in
[37:32] man am amen amen than Jesus going to
[37:37] read it again it's not too long I'm
[37:39] going to finish now the baptism of the
[37:41] Holy Ghost puts God back in man am to
[37:45] live in man and to restore a man to a
[37:48] state of communion with him again amen

[37:54] right amen that's the purpose of the
[37:57] Holy Ghost dwelling in you working out
[38:00] his plans to finish his Plan of
[38:03] Redemption amen amen now that's a
[38:06] sobering thought God needs to finish his
[38:09] Plan of Redemption but he requires man
[38:12] to finish
[38:13] it he needs the holy ghost in a man to
[38:17] finish the Plan of
[38:19] Redemption working through you making
[38:22] you a coworker with him
[38:25] amen amen that if you're writing it down
[38:29] in what was the Holy Ghost given for
[38:31] 59121
[38:33] 17
[38:35] amen so as as I'm closing now we can
[38:37] stand together let's stand together I
[38:41] want you to think on these things God
[38:44] wants a glorious holy ghost filled
[38:48] Church there can be no glory without the
[38:51] Holy
[38:53] Ghost amen
[38:57] we we can't be receiving the word of God
[39:00] without the Holy Ghost amen amen yes

[39:11] to the word of God the Holy Ghost In You
[39:13] amen hallelujah will punctuate every
[39:16] word of God with an
[39:18] amen in fact the Holy Ghost amen if you
[39:21] really allowing the Holy Ghost within
[39:23] you even now there should be a change
[39:26] within you amen because you are able to
[39:28] say Lord I am weighed tonight in the
[39:31] balances amen and I'm found wanting amen
[39:35] let's just take prayer life Lord I'm
[39:36] found wanting let's just take Bible
[39:38] reading Time Lord I'm found wanting
[39:40] let's take the reading the message of
[39:41] the hour listening to something I'm
[39:43] found wanting
[39:46] amen amen let's not be professors of the
[39:50] word
[39:52] yes the Bible says it this way don't be
[39:54] hearers of the word but be doers of the
[39:58] word amen I find amen we at this
[40:01] Junction time now where if we if we
[40:04] don't
[40:06] really if you read revelation 22 there
[40:09] it says oh let's just cut it off let him
[40:11] who filthy be
[40:14] filthy and let him who holy be
[40:18] holy
[40:19] amen we don't want to come to that time
[40:22] now where we hear the word of God and
[40:25] our conscience is seared with a hot ey
[40:28] and it has no effect on us we can't we
[40:32] can't even pray with
[40:35] tears we can't even pray with repentance
[40:38] we can't even pray amen for 10
[40:44] minutes and you know what we we can't
[40:47] even we don't even pretend that we can
[40:49] pray for longer you watch when we pray
[40:51] in the church 10 minutes flat and
[40:54] everyone's dead there's no groan of the
[40:57] spirit why we are trying to control the
[41:00] Holy
[41:01] Spirit when the Bible says that the Holy
[41:04] Ghost within us makes groanings on our
[41:08] behalf
[41:09] amen so forget what you know about
[41:12] Christianity forget what you think you
[41:14] know about how we should behave and act
[41:16] and right now I want you to begin to be
[41:18] able to say holy spirit I give you full
[41:21] control over my body my soul my
[41:25] spirit one time you come into His
[41:28] presence you'll never be the same again
[41:31] God wants a glorious Church Without spot
[41:34] without
[41:35] wrinkle if God were to Rapture you
[41:37] tonight will he be able to take you if
[41:39] he was
[41:40] coming amen amen
[41:44] hallelujah have we emptied out the world
[41:47] Lord have we emptied out our love for
[41:50] money have we emptied out amen our
[41:52] pursuit of material things
[41:55] yes and can can be focused and say Lord
[41:59] I realize that those are my
[42:00] responsibilities in life but I don't
[42:03] want that to be the main
[42:06] thing you know when there's a love for
[42:08] God and that's why I love listening to
[42:09] some testimonies of the early day
[42:12] Brothers they'll tell you they couldn't
[42:14] wait for their lunch break they couldn't
[42:16] wait to get alone and just maybe read a
[42:19] book or read the Bible it became their
[42:23] passion yes became their life after
[42:27] after after work they'll meet with
[42:31] Brothers they just wanted to be around
[42:33] the word amen where are our own
[42:36] experiences of
[42:38] that where where is our own love for
[42:42] that and now we have more technology
[42:44] that time they couldn't phone one
[42:46] another that time they they they
[42:49] couldn't WhatsApp one another they had
[42:51] to physically meet one another they'll
[42:53] tell you they used to go till 2:00 in
[42:55] the morning and they have to wake up
[42:57] again maybe at 5:00 in the morning what
[43:00] is that a passion because they met a
[43:03] reality they saw truth in the message
[43:05] they saw something in the message that
[43:07] changed their lives amen yes Lord
[43:13] yes we're our own
[43:17] experiences we can't have intellectual
[43:19] experiences or we can't be warmed by
[43:22] their
[43:23] fire young men brothers and sisters I'm
[43:27] challenging
[43:28] us what are we doing for the kingdom of
[43:32] God Amen just because we got 5 R we
[43:35] think we're
[43:36] okay we can buy a loaf of bread we can
