in the span when the whole world is unsure and they don't know where they're going and what's gonna happen and everything else but I'll say kept the state of the Word of God amen then to our faith is stay on the promised Word of God and then we thank Bob you know he spoken everything to us you know as I said this word of God the Bible tells us the past tells us of present and also telling us what's waiting in the future everything God has given us a big leg so everything all the answers he and the Word of God so faith is nesting on this world especially in these last days where the Word of God has been open to us I meant the true revelation has done so the am denominator Brian she's predestinated elected to receive and to be at this age she got for us and they say you know I put us in this age right other believers have gone through other ages but it put us here at this age and we believe the world and press on to the coming of the Lord we know there's a tribulation for the world waiting ahead and there's a rapture waiting also to catch us all raised alone so we believe by faith by grace our names are they in the Lamb's Book of Life see all whose names are not there they are the one girl did you see and but he says the one that names are they will not be deceived so we will stand with the way we weren't going to the systems of this world into the programs that everything else that by deception they don't even know they're gonna be snuck into it but we'll take a stand for the Word of God the Bible has filled believers entire create this money from their savage not well he's got the flu right well rule touch him and make away free also brother sorry he went to the hospital this past week and the desert check is he's for a couple for a few months he had you know respiratory problems and things like that but the dribbler tests and they found cysts some growth on his land right so is they will go back this Wednesday and they're gonna assess how they do not break him that because he's a complicated case you know what is chest and all the states and so it's a dicey thing so you was gone Wednesday to decide other than a afraid and then want to remove it so we just bring up a little bit for the Lord the Lord will make a way through I went on the internet and I checked about you know these system roads and all of the lungs and I live quite a bit so the left side of your lung is in two sections right that's what the same the left side is two sections the right side is three sections right let me show you there if there's a there's a growth in one particular spot then happy prophecy which they just cut it off as a weight and if it's on one section of the five on the left or right you can either take up the wrong section oh right and if you Beach taking off one side of the lung I can take up the whole side of the law after the person through loops right and gap in there to show the other one throws in there you know and also they do lung transplants you know actually see them also do a lung transplant they take out a lung from somebody else in and Transplant it into the person so it's a it's not a very serious thing but you know they go to cutting there and getting there and all these things and you know cut off that area where the growth is so let's say I pray the Lord will make a way for it and you know be with him and give him grace so he's going on Wednesday for the graces one day and when they could operate and all this thing so and also we got used that believers in the Phoenix Arizona the pastor there Ron Peterson and some members of his church he's got the virus and his wife has got the virus and he's living awesome is really in hospital now but is that the treatment now and he said it's really much fine but is that the treatment they are giving him the drugs that will shorten the space of time you stay in hospital see so this thing is to carry God and also in our country the juice everyday is just increasing all the time he's speaking now here in this school you know somebody writer number fifty sixty in one school and one school year one school one police station day and all these things in there so just growing and also set parts of the world also growing but we just pray God will keep us by his place so let's say said what we want to do I don't need Obama's big crowds and obviously as far as stay away from there and honestly you don't know where they see and who's got it so we just we gotta make so it was just a lot at this time and just keep playing I also love to see us also on Saturday the 4th of July sister Tipton they want to have their Thanksgiving selves you know be at a place where she lived some program yesterday other believers but they are living there they left us here the living Bay I will just think in this town you know what the Prophet went beyond the captain of time you never saw all the Christian from all the other ages you never saw Paul and everybody else he just saw the people that were saved Monday is ministry said there were millions of them millions see then you know yes the angel must Paul also be staying but waiting to be you know just about what he preached he says the apart also be tested see say praise God all agreed what Paul preached everything here at the Bible yes what is recording the Word of God he saw he was there yeah Malachi 4 so he called it the same and these ministries so we thank God we had a faithful leader amen he's fulfilled what he was said to do the work that was covered around him he was faithful of the word right till the end raised a lot so we also waiting to see him and all the saints of like precious faith that have gone on through the ages praise Allah what a glorious day and he says remember it's perfect on the other side mass the reason they're struggling because this perfection over this a mess so we thank God so you know struggles you know just know it's perfect on the inside what a glorious thing it is let's stand as a brother just I'm going to punish them to pray god bless you but and that's a blessing everything must be the world so we thank God the anointing and revelation we pray that we'll be pressed away [Music] oh Jesus in the end we all agree to a prayer to be blessed this morning if I met me yet to catch something on the present of the Almighty God Amen I don't believe yeah and just to gather and just to clear our functions yeah amen I think we're far beyond that now Rezo Amen we far beyond the traditions of coming to church imagine we are recognizing that we are deign to be in this age to be an appointed time to receive a message and it is appointed time and season we believe that we are here and ordained for a specific purpose amen and our purpose in this day is to meet the rapture in a man every age and it's own part to play out we come in this last stage and we are here received a message and to make the rapture amen so therefore now we can be seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen whatever you need this morning I don't know the lord knows is the same yesterday today and forever you can still design the hearts and thoughts of you nothing could be hid from him imagine the Lord knows everyone's heart the Lord knows everyone's needs even before you ask well we're gonna pray this morning and pray that he will meet you at your point of need wherever you may be even if you're steaming in whatever is your need this morning ye Jehovah Jireh or provider he drove our rough Rahila every redemptive blessings belongs to them there are part of him and if you believe that you are part of him this morning you have the rightful clings to those of the gym to play MLS pray our gracious God and loving father as we gathered here this morning in the way that you have described us to gather Lord yes in your provided place of worship in advance and we can gladly say within our hearts father then we're not yeah by man-made traditions man-made trees but we are here because you have you finally chose us to be here you have divinely call us by your elected love it's worth your election choosing of God and Lord even before the foundations of the earth you knew that we were cut out for the Aged sub generators and you knew that because we will come you're gonna give us an anointing people in this age of God and as we gathered yet this morning father each one with our various needs father we laid em at your feet right now I prayed all that you'll meet each one at their point of need Lord we know that you don't like you to see your children begging for bread we know that you don't like to see your children in pain and agony Oh God and therefore you could come down and become tangible you became the substance 2000 years ago so that you can be touched by the feelings upon women in the body and right now Lord you know the things that your true and are going through father and even as they put a petition before you right now this morning I pray right now Lord that you discern the heart and intents of their parts and you meet them Lord and they don't need father and I don't believe that we are speaking Lord to a god that killed your eyes you I live in God living amongst your people of are doing the very works that happen in the Bible you are in your dead father for you are the same yesterday today and forever father we give me the praise glory honor for that you have done for us - mom anymore Lord as we come down Lord to receive from you come and speak to us this morning come and feed our God the type of food that we need you know this the meat that we need in a season Lord coming season it correctly Oh God so it can be epic Isaac to us one day so that we can that just to the bar and Lord we can partake and Lord we can grow strength from eater by taking out into maturity about taking us from glory to glory oh god it come and speak to us this morning in Jesus name Amen amen glad to be none of God's money let's turn our Bibles to the book of John reading from chapter 14 verse 1 to 7 I mean Amen I believe that God has something to say to all this money I think what Ronnie does eat it on the nail the thing that he was just speaking on now so I believe the Holy Spirit knows what do you want to be a man a man in John chapter 40 reading from verses 1 to 7 Jesus speaking says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am they they a maybe also hmm and would I go you know and the way you know Thomas saith unto Him Lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way jesus said I say unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if he had known me yeah when you should have known my father also and from n for you know him and have seen him a man you may be seated we're gonna speak this morning on the thing there ought to be a man a man that's why I said pastor Ronnie just hit it on the nail this morning he and I don't believe that anything happened by chance I believe the Holy Spirit is in control and he knows what he wants said to his people so we can speak on a subject all the things that are to be amen and for the subtitle we'll call it in the junction of time a man knowing the junction of time amen even I believe it's very important to always know the time that you living in because you might miss something that is happening in the hour that you're living in amen you might look at something in the past and rejoice upon it you might look at something in the future and look forward towards it but you're not looking at what's happening right now in the present hour so we're looking at the things that have to be we know the prophets he said to us that reading from this it's a very familiar structure and everybody knows this to be a funeral message but the property looking is what you said you want to draw from the context of it we're not looking just at the checks let's look at it in the context let's look at the picture bigger picture of it what Jesus is speaking about you remember yeah what is when he's speaking the scripture in John chapter 14 in John chapter 13 is breaking bread and giving wine to the disciples amen and we know we can trace that that type of characteristics or that type of attribute he write to Abraham method equals day after the slaughter of the king amen to come and break the bread and wine and give red and white to Abraham amen and here's my Connecticut game and he is now to East he's coming now to this to the seed of Abraham so we find that Jesus life is fixing to leave the earth so what is trying to show them that life is not ended in depth remember he's come to spoil every power and principalities a mess it's come to crush Satan a madman you come to take the sting of death but he's saying to his disciples would I go you know and the way you know he said I go to prepare a place for you and I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there may be also so he tried to say he's not trying to say to them he has to go and create something now he knows because we know we only have bodies waiting for us but he has to prepare a way for them to get there he remember we bypassed I was the offerees and we come into this flesh body we can buy a wrong Union amen because of the wrong act that happened in the Garden of Eden and because of the wrong union of our first births we cannot go to where we supposed to go but Jesus said I'll go and prepare a place for you none of us I will make provision in the way you should come there and he's been making provision throughout the seven church ages amen he was the one in the book of Revelation and the seven star is an amen amen and each time each star represented a messenger of the age a man and in every age a message went forth and whatever when the people received the message he caught them they captured him and he came under the message of the age amen and they were saved in age hey man man and we find that each age and a messenger in each age word came forth amen and it caught the attention of the people what happened when the word was rejected so it isn't very interesting now Jesus is speaking about things that are to be and remember this message is linked to the rapture message he is actually a continuation of the message of the lecture remember what the Prophet was speaking on the message of the rapture he was in this place and he was keep getting eaten up to the end of the service mmm because of the time and but he had all these thoughts and he was a continuation of those thoughts and then he comes and preached this message things that ought to be amen amen so you know you've got to take it together amen so Jesus speaking to the disciples when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose doing a man in John 12:24 it says bitterly bitterly I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone it bringeth forth much food but if you die bring it forth much fruit so what are you trying to say if I thought he said he except I die I'll be the only one would have the awfully body if I don't make a way for you even if I don't make a way for you you are not going to get to that body I'll be the only one walking around after Libya with that body because jesus never buy pasta Stephanie amen he was the logos that came up from God amen he was the javanese the logos amen the same one that that Moses saw he saw the back part of the mat there was a deal for your God the same one that come to Abraham amen he wasn't one yeah but we bypassed all theophany we come into this world sorry to be tested and we were trapped into the space down amen we got trapped into the space dollars but now Jesus want to take out all the space dolls now you're saying in my father amen you are in the natural you are laying the kernel you are yeah the corruptible hey man you are yang the mortal but I'm going to show you the incorruptible I want to show you the immortal I want to show you not not not the house of mr. and mrs. so-and-so met in a game a union and you were born in I want to show you were holding my father's house are many mansions he say this yeah you say in my father's all these many kind of mansions I don't believe that when we get to heaven that we will be just everybody just look just exactly alike I don't believe it all we blondes or brunettes or little big or Giants I believe that God is a God of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains for little mountains he got planes he got gathered he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it and he made the seasons he made summer will just spring out him he made season each shallows he's a God of righty he made you in a variety some men are real prosperous and some are real dogmatic and others are fine I was a kind and you just find all different kinds of people amen enemies Kingdom see he said look at st. Peter and judging my Andrew Andrew is the prayer warrior just need only need all the time he and the Apostle Peter was one of those firebrands they preach and so fun and poor was most fallen alike and see Moses wrote the first four books of the old which he wrote the Old Testament the risk of it was the laws and kings and sons and so forth and what someone wrote of the prophets but Moses wrote the roles the first four books of the first four books of the Bible Genesis Exodus Leviticus and Deuteronomy do not run on me and then Paul wrote the New Testament that's true Matthew Mark Luke and John wrote the ex of what they can place so what but Paul separated law and grace and put it in his place yes he was the light of the New Testament he gave us the writings of the New Testament shedding the Word of God in order so he said I noticed many mansions many kind of mansions so what he's trying to show us now when he's talking about the many mansions he has different types of people live amen amen and you look at the there's millions of people out there that's gonna make this mansion they men from every Church change if you look at the dark age alone 68 million people were martyred every age every messanger the people under them that's why this problem when he went beyond the curtain of time he was gathered with these people and every messenger was gathered with a people of every age but the entire all those ages make up the body of Christ it make up all his mentioned amens but what it was it's the often easy man many theophanies coming together make you up dimension amen what he was forming his pyramid city amen and she was at dawn at the Bible book of Revelation says she was adorned as a bride a man coming down from heaven email because one of these days we know like what Jesus was in the year 2000 years ago he had to empty out paradise amen he had to empty attenders what are these days the six that I mentioned will have to be emptied out and you have to come and populate the earth amen because why there will be your earth that will be renovated there will be other than will be foot for it to dwell in and she loves to come and populate this earth I don't know when I've talked about population I don't mean they're common repopulate I'm talking but when there's no one else here you've got everything else is destroyed they will come in populated amen that will make up the population of the earth at a time even in the Millennium a man all this was either he's preaching his things things that have to be is pitching the rapture message but God at that time he didn't want it to be revealed so he you know today is not saying all these things like when Jesus was on you and he comes and says it in terrible form he's coming and speaking his thing but he wasn't our amen where there will be a bride on the earth amen where the seals are broken to her amen and nothing is it from an event the entire revolution that will be to her because why what he said I would say the King it was the Holy Ghost coming a great Haven the very same own egos that was there revealing the seals to him he's a very holy go that will come and feed us back this word again so we find that John 24 he said bitterly verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die the pilot alone if we die and bring it forth much it'll bring it forth much fruit now that the seals are broken and the Bible now to us it becomes a new book amen because everybody come to - it comes to make the Bible in plain view to us from Genesis to Revelation we start to see it in this context now we start to understand this this book of redemption we start to understand Christ is the mystery of God's revealed God's three for purpose plan that he had right from the beginning amen then he wanted to restore fallen air for the matter more than Adam fallen Eve and fallen Eden and he's working through this plan right through the Bible amen and we're looking at different characteristics in the by characters in the Bible we watch God calling on Abraham out of Babylon amen and he called him to a place that he didn't even know but Abraham by faith he went sojourn in a strange land even hey man but all this while he was searching for a city whose Buddha and make me his boy hey man he wanted you and he suffered to set for the city and we know that one day he had a visitation a man started first it was a voice speaking to him and then it was he's coming now into your free forum to speak to him so he met the king of that city a man when he comes into open forum what he's doing Abraham is meeting the king of the city Amos and he knows that is there does eternal city and he began to search for it hmm and he know that he was just so joining and so joining and he knew that it was a better place he was a better life amen because in Genesis 18 when he comes to it now is Elohim amen he comes to him and he promises them he come visit him at the time of life what happened after that there was a body change amen the fact there was a body change it showed to Abraham the day in the place he men Dave another place it is another dimension amen there is another place where you can have this body hey man because the experience that body change right there where did that body change come from what came from some from another world hey man what come from another dimension and come to him and being a prophet he saw he saw three of them but he said you're my lord he identified who years would amen in this day there was seven angels coming down but we recognize the mighty angel amen we like a knife boiling shall come down a man the mighty God and will before us yes amen the mighty God comes to Plainview in front of us hidden from the from the from the world amen just like when Jesus went across wounded when the Train of the temple the the Train of the for the cut-ins was was lately trainees the curtain was read between and they Jesus on the cross comes in plain view he but hidden to the people at that time given to the Jews at that time they were blinded and just like that he comes in plain view to us but he's hidden from the world he's hidden from the system man cannot see what happened people are talking about the coming of the Lord but we know that is the sequence of event that happens there's a sequence of events that must take place before the coming of the Lord we know that the rapture was the hidden must it was a cycle that had to happen amen but everyone speaking about the coming of the Lord everyone speaking about a repkin going to heaven how are you going to go there if there was no preparation for you II he said I go to prepare a place for you aren't you glad this morning that through all the faults and failures in the flesh to all the sin of mankind he is going to prepare a place for us and when you began to see that one going take that book in Revelation chapter 5 Amen that one that was fun worthy when you personally begin to see that you begin to take that book and you begin to see those seals broken amen and you'll begin to see that now I'll be the tone for hey man now I mean accounted for my name is let book and if my name is in that book you cannot be taken out you're not being doubt anymore who you are you'll not be wavering anymore you'll not be tossed to and fro you will recognize your position you will recognize that you are saved by a saving grace of God you will recognize that it was purely election you're like a night you know your predestinated in today's age for a purpose amen but we find exactly the crystals we look at people dying every day we'll get a body decaying every day we look at the bodies suffering we look at people getting older we look at all kind of diseases coming in pestilences and so forth but he is a better body there is one waiting day man me man there's one not matrons did one who chair the foundation hey hey man when we come in his first but he'd come from the this first but he comes from a life that started in the Garden of Eden it comes by perversion that comes from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil our first birth comes from perversion it comes from the body responds amen but this one has foundations and bodies speaking about it yeah because Paul meant a he went into the land and he began to see these things hey man for you Akhil himself you duty and his body and then he sees himself in another body even another body but isn't that body but he sees himself in another body but he wasn't lawful for him to speak there yes because he wasn't meant for the rage yes hey man he wasn't meant for him to speak at that time there to be an appointed time an appointed season where people will be anointed with a share of above the age and there will be anointed to receive it because they have to come in a age where there will be Eagles because everything else comes over he goes go then disintegrates you won't be able to digest it hey man you have to be an appointed time an appointed season when there be a people that is ready to take the flights amen aren't you glad this city has foundations but now we desire we honestly desire to be floated upon we grow me abundance that's what Polly saying policy needs now and this became he was taking injured place he was taken to the land and he's speaking here he said but now they desire a better place amen well I'd be designing that happy I'll be creaming I agreed not only feeling to be clothed upon with their clothing hey I'll be desiring to be clothed with that body don't we want to put up this body amen don't we want to are we saying to ourselves that we are the ones that come in this day not money did we receive the new birth but we are also going to see you amen a new body yes amen in the other age if they receive the new birth but in this age we which are live in the main I come in a age where without one you want to see the new birth but this pistols hey man he's gonna change for mortal three mortality amen we have a little see when you buddy hey man when he came to them when he came to Abraham amen when Son of Man comes to Abraham what happens you got the sign of the son of man and what happens did he receive a body change when he comes to the natural seed of Abraham 2,000 years ago what happened you received the new birth but when he comes to us the Royal seed of Abraham amen when he comes to other not royalty we will receive the new birth and a body change we will defy death amen we will say death way your sting grave where is your victory amen even though they died in Christ because some will go by the way of death yeah but what does it matter because they're going to be raised to - amen they will come up in corrupt the production will protein corruption amen so what are you where do you live where do you die things that have to be amen these things that I prepared for us I go to prepare a place for you easy to use disciples in other what you say less the corner wheat 42 Donna died abides alone he wants us to he said that I may come and receive you to myself he said that where I am there ye may be also where I am he's gonna be the glorified state they matter and he wants us to be there also in the 35 states he wants us to be clouded with another body amen oh don't you wish you can take off the clothing on now and go into the engine to the other body Amen at that body one of these days those theophanies is gonna empty out and it's been a duck tail with your body and it's gonna give you that glorification amen and that is why every day you are changing from glory unto glory because the very word that you receive in his day he's giving you the change amen he's changing every is quickening that quickening power is within you amen I mean what could have put us in DHE but he chose us to come in this age better and if he chose you to come in this year you must anoint you for this age to overcome you must be an overcomer like the other cameras in every age in every age they an overcoming be overcoming the agent wig caps amen and they will make up the millions they don't come and populate the earth amen amen can you believe that from seven Church ages they will come once there are silicium and there is no sense amen there's no suffering there's no pain you can't go there with Sidney madness it takes perfect fit together amen amen and the only way you can get perfect feet amen when this word comes known to you Amen this seven thunders come to utter their voices come to a weekly event he comes to position you he comes to give you a puppy face amen amen all the doggy of the world you didn't have a perfect faith yes why are the people tossed to and fro he he men now Gordo Knight from Israel what he's about to do when he was destroying Sodom and Gomorrah he went to Abraham and he said channa hide from an heir what I'm gonna do business amen he went and showed him in plain view what he's gonna do to Sodom and tomorrow and God not only anointed us in this age he come to reveal to us what really happened he come to reveal to us how sit-ins comfy schemes gonna work our sickness didn't deceive the nation's how in deceiving the people of the world and he comes to show us what the end result will be how he's been destroyed a certain fire so yeah we are in the temporal body where our bodies are aging with a body that decaying all type of sicknesses all type of diseases what happened those angels that lost the first inheritance then left a first estate they became fallen angels became cancer became hiv-aids became temple tuberculosis became all kind of diseases became all kind of things and now you've got a 200 million demons unleashed on the earth it's coming around weighing and making man's mind corruptible it's bringing possessing demon possessing people's minds making them do all kinds of evil things but while that is happening everyone has been unleashed on earth amen while that is helping get a pride she filled up for the j-man she received the message she sealed up to seal the big news to her hey man the field of her life have been shown to her and what happened she's been sealed up with a man you see when you think about the place they when you think about heaven when poor windy is on his place he proper went beyond the curtain of time he saw this place but the carnal mind think of it we think about a place like New York City we think about California we think about places that we have on earth we think about cars we think about anything but it's not like that amen it's a different civilization amen it's far far more superior than what we think what else our natural mind cannot fathom it amen that is why you here to be revealed to us and we're to go get one in this hour go inspire the land come and give us a good report I would saw some of you there when I was there so I wiped it I saw some of you read this day while I'm honored he's sort of day and he saw his body like unabated amen so that can't be Jesus talking about when creating a body for you then when that's already done a minute when he's talking about preparing a way for you to get there because you need a new birth to get it wound up by your first but you cannot get the first but will never get you there yes you must die to the whole nature the first husband must be put away amen the whole nature will be put away you need the new birth to get there amen what a promise we have we don't have a promise to come to do together and just become nominal Christians have a social gathering that we come to church in the form to clear your conscience amen we are created for a purpose Jesus was the first born of a new civilization amen he was there the show has a different yet different species we had different kind of people yes he come to speak to us about another place amen he come to speak up to a house about another body and that's why you wasn't up worrying about the temporal things when he was preaching around at that time you wasn't talking about temporal thing he was keep speaking about heaven he's speaking here and speak about other things he kept speaking about don't worry what man can do to the body but why do you get to the soul he said sell a ball if you find that pearl of great price set up all that you have and buy this pearl amen what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world but lose your soul even without preaching material things we're not pretty things that pertain to the five senses yet we know that all the all the blessings belongs to us they are blessings like healing and so forth the reason why we have healing because healing is a sign of showing that his body can be healed it's a science what here it's funny the section of showing us that one day this body gonna be totally use amen because why the spirit man you save the spirit my little me or the slash man has to die every day this flush man has to be put on a subjection every day daily you'll be tested there will you be tried yes for when you to understand all that a junction of time that you're living in now you realize now one of these days the sixth dimension must be emptied out amen are we making preparation are we getting our lives in order Amen are we still worried about pulling things on this earth I'm still worried about the carnal things are we still at the stage and saying Lord oh Lord I'm so unworthy Lord I'm so unworthy or did you realize it whether he was worthy one body you are you only lifted no one was for whatever he was the one there's nothing that you can do to make yourself buddy there's nothing that you can do you had a tuba to your stature yes what can you do to make yourself what II know what I found money he was the one never take the book even he chose you Thank You Man if you can see that if you haven't seen that it means those scenes happen be loosely hey man you still got the seals closed up amen God got him of every age a variety of people John 13 what he's doing there is breaking bread with the Last Supper giving bread and wine to his disciples he a man he and just before that just after that with John 14 where he is now he's speaking about a better place why is giving them bread and wine day because what is what is tapping is broken why you saying he's showing them how we didn't prepare this place for them he's through his body it's gonna be - a blood sacrifice amen and he's gonna be because of his broken body we only have to die and then he comes in John 14 you say I go to prepare a place for you so yeah in John 13 he's breaking bread to them and show him this is my body remember me he told us in remembrance of me so in showing them a symbol what going to happen and what it would take amen he's showing them so in other words you're showing them the things that are going to be now what is what is going to take to get there what it will take to be where he is it would take what he did for you then what you do for yourself amen he had to prepare a place for you he had to make a provision for you amen and that's what he did this what uh what was sealed up in your Seventh Seal is completely revealed II we don't know everything but every time you read the Bible now every time you open the word you becoming more plain to us who is revealing it is it our knowledge is it how intellect is it because we understand the Greek no it's the same Holy Ghost that's coming and revealing to us it's the same old ego that coming in speeding up the word and God chose men to preach the word and God is always gonna use man yes now he's bought the fivefold ministry day and they're gonna be preaching the word but the Holy Ghost have to personally deliver to you it means amen what was the message you made us look for he made us look for the rapture out of this message who speaks about the depth James dismiss it made us speak about a body chain amen he made us speak up on a body change how to get out of the order to get out of this dimension so another dimension just mess it made us think about immortality amen before all you think about is I love my life I do what I need to do yo come a time we have to die but this message suppose speaks to us about life beyond the dream he's a man and we find that this when he went to Abraham he had a body change when he went to the natural seed of Abraham Gary knew but when he comes to us in this day a man I'll only come a mighty angel come down from heaven amen he comes down with a stimulation of Revelation he meant me what do you say upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail hey man this bride is stimulated about emulation and he comes so not only will she have the new birth in this day that whatever would she have the token in his day but she's going to have a change of body amen that is something hard for the people to understand like it's same like when is aya the property hundred years before the birth of Christ a virgin shall conceive now being a property well you could say what God taught him to say the people are not going to believe how does gonna be a body change but he is going to be he'd happen in a period of time amen even every names time to Abraham and Sarah hey man they yield the Sarah yeah even today is one with a new name Amen when did I take place when Cheryl to see the new name he it was a body change amen and they wanted to see when you Damon asawa amen and that's the time now things there are to be amen what junction of time are we living in Paul speaking in 2nd Corinthians 5 to 7 so in this we growth earnestly desiring to be clothed in the formula which is from heaven we want to be close at all which is from heaven amen what how old is talking about what house in heaven that we have we have a house here at Jim Crow laws of corruptible house but there's a house which is in heaven and we decide to be clothed upon it up with a house from heaven amen the incorruptible amen we are earnestly desiring it we are being influenced by it amen every time you you are lining yourself to read a man every time you feel a you have this conviction or something he's speaking to you something to make you get closer to God and you feel you can hear your thoughts but you hear yourself the real self amen you yelling from the real you journey from the positive view this is the negative view that is in a battleground here but you are getting influence from the real you thank you and you're lining yourself you're getting influenced day by day but if you don't get influenced it means from above then you're getting influenced from beneath mm-hmm amen you can either get influenced from above companies but we're not partaking anymore after the new birth we don't party anymore from the bottomless pit amen we're not partaking from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil the one who taught foundations we are passing you from the one with foliation amen and once the church was foundation is built upon its abundant one Christ a man needs a solid rock the roots we stand hey man this is bull this body is built upon the foundation of Jesus Christ amen amen it's built upon the foundation from the tree of life not from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in him and when Paul went over there he saw one day that foundation he saw a husband give us a foundation he had no son nothing from this civilization even in other words there wasn't no cars there was no building that we see here nothing from a scientific make nothing that we think of scientifically a conditioned and so forth science make it was like that day you never see that hey man so what was Paul is saying up from this if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we already have one waiting amen it's justified of something that he experienced amen he's so funny it's just too many because he experienced this you went there and he saw you he didn't care now you know that the end result in a bead again I take his head out he's gonna be beheaded it wasn't a bother to him because you already saw amen anybody got the a new is buddy that's a you didn't care they can give us money because if this body dies it doesn't matter my body is there the perfect me is there yes I have all this struggling in looking if you wanted to read the book of back to life you if you read the letters of Paul properly you'll actually see that certain places kindly he's speaking about what he's suffering and how he's facilities are you got how you had to get whooped and so forth you could actually feel that Polly kinda the suffering that he went through in the flesh but he knew what waits in a mint so he was willing to sacrifice everything he didn't care because what awaits him is greater this present some swing is not worthy to be compared to what awaits you amen he went from the dust of this from this dust on the dust is body is made from the party from the chemicals of the cylinders from the dust to the celestial Amen the Stars a man of heaven the sons of God amen the showt come together the living Saints amen amen it was a three for purpose of God he teaches that in the rapture before the smithy things that ought to be a shout a voice attempting and it was a time and a season a specific time in this ministry then the shot had to take place revelation 10 wanted to take place at a specific time and what he was God using a prophet to preach to bring his message he meant there was a shout to gather the living scenes together but was all the words revealed at the time no he was still far there was just kept in time it was just a gathering time you just being full-time hmm but you're by the time when the Holy Ghost interrupts it I'll run this trail again hey buddy hey man he was an appointed time and season when you come and make this word claim you to us open up all these things that happen in Abraham's life open up all his things that happened between Abraham and Sarah between route between Iommi and Boaz and yes and yesterday and so forth hmm sure one story in the Bible a continuation amen God in continuation one story after the other amen they shot get it us to prepare us for what for translation fail me amen to go into the rapture because if there wasn't a message waiting for what was going together what was good the chain help us change his body he meant they had to be something he said I go to prepare a place for you these are the preparations that was being done for us amen you are the preparations being done for us to leave discussed out to leave what we were sucked in just this this time element amen the one that we come to be trying to be tested in and by being tried and means history one day we'll read will realize how much more the glory will be how much more rejoicing it will be amen you don't see it now but one day when you are dead side amen what do I need new body and you realize already went through all the sufferings that you went to all this things that tried you ingested you will be more rejoicing when you see what it brought forth amen when you see yourself in codification but how do we walk we don't want by sight we want by saying Amen we are fake civilization we don't worry about what we see we worked but what we do not see because the thing that on Cinnabar faith is second in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 he speaks about by faith Abraham sojourning strange learning but faith said I counted him worthy him and even when he does when he reveals he has hearts that will see all this time Abraham spoke about it I had a visitation and so far but now Sarah I experienced the designing of the heart and a fake posted up for email and she receives a new name amen then he come to reveal to you the mysteries of your life he did he come to break the seals of your life to you didn't it you need to identify to you you're not from here mmm yes you form another civilization baby you're not from this well you know of this world you are in this world but you're not of this world you come you are just coming as age for a purpose your communist age to be tried tested born again conquer Satan even to overcome Satan hidden and to take a flight amen we look at the junction of time that we had so many years of receiving dismissing the bride has been in the Bible for so many years the brand has been feasting on the word for a year but now we are on the junction of time all it was we received all the mechanics amen we receive all the word in of these days man it's time we're like must strike amen amen it's time for it's time for the Holy Ghost is Paquita spotted life in it may come to ignite that word to bring in that enemy amen yes that quickly power amen God's power of transformation he says now my unbelief in all of God's word has brought the seed of unholiness in Satan's even we are now entering in where Sydney is taking the tone and the Antichrist [Music] have we seen the junction of time now in an even on this earth he even of sin for budget religion he started not upon I am Satan I am I am the great angel not a man no not upon that but a point for watching God's Word that's how he started in the beginning the one with no foundation the one from the bottomless pits look what he done to the human race it brought us into depth the end result was depth one lie one lie being influenced from the bottomless pit which was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil right they in the Garden of Eden one life one perversion brought for the wrong births and the end result was death God said on that day each of the food we shall surely die and one day with the Lord is like a thousand years to us and the thousand years like one day he said on death days shall surely die no man has left for the thousand years but in the Millennium amen amen to the second hand amen - Christ him and he comes to prepare a place for us he comes to make a way for us amen this new birth now he's gonna take us now to a body change and that body will take us with a thousand years and beyond them hey man is gonna take us to eternity amen because that body come from the eternal thoughts of going this flesh body to drop in his time zone to a space of time but that body comes from the eternal total body comfort amen Oh God transform us today by your power by the renewing of our mind to turn from the media element of this world now on to the Word of God II and wait maybe be renewed by the transforming power of God upon the seated in our hearts that we believe and to creatures called sons and daughters of God amen that creatures come from this from this first but not creatures that are come from the beasts nature from the animal nature ever no creatures there are sons and daughters a body he says Jesus speaks in flesh and blood is not the wheel to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who I am and upon this rock I'll build my place of worship and the gates of Hell can shake you down amen amen he come to spoil the principalities come to spoil our powers and he come to anointing as our would anoint him to spoiled principalities the spoil powers to continue the work that he did because we become that body thus our he-man and we know that no matter what we going through is coming a time which is going to be the change he meant we find that everyone when they were faith they meant by faith Enoch walked with God II hey man he has a body change by faith amen he was a faith that God giving amen by faith Abraham sojourn in the strange let me but faith Paul was called out amen for me the full of fire of our faith he was healing in each but faith every Messenger was seized in the age go seven stars amen was healing age with a group of people by faith and we find that these over camels will come in the resurrection amen we're not going to see people that died in this generation only e we're going to see over comers from seven churches Amen come up in the resurrection because that seven that six dimension has to be emptied out amen it must be emptied out these are

bride is gonna take a flight one of these days will be floated with that body that we desiring that we honestly container containing to be closer relate because from the time we heard of it from the time it's revealed to us you know to be trapped in the space not anymore from the time it's revealed to you are desiring to be clothed relieved in your father's house amen many mansions different type

amen to give you praise and glory okay just to go further talking about Israel army of you at their news this morning anybody listen to the news on the radio Robin okay talk about Israel now our country is in a serious problem that is the government and other political parties because they are against Israel the bottle says those who bless Israel be bless those who curse Israel be cursed now because only uses foreign the supreme what's it called McRae McRae McRae my sister chief justice the Chief Justice is the highest authority Israel the highest authority he said he is for Israel and he says the Bible said was pray for Jerusalem and he quoted the scripture from the book of Psalm that you know I think he's steady lad or something and he said all those who bless Israel be blessed all those who cast is going to be cursed now as a chief justice the highest or in the code day now they are calling for him to resign that's in the news and they answer no because why they NC want to support the Palestinians but the Bible said those who can seize will be cursed so they don't stand for Israel the back in the Palestinians see so we thank god this our country is gone could that say yes they're gone just for the sake of the bride the bride would be yeah see so just a moment are they in the calling for him to resign the chief justice but he says listen dia the Bible says we must pray for his left we must pray for Jerusalem hasten things that are to do you know when the Prophet lost his first wife in the flood 1947 she actually died I think it was TB or something she actually died and they didn't want to let the proper to get to her but he says now I'm going to go to see her and then later down in the basement over there were all the dead bodies that she was dead I want the Prophet when they're shooting at me talking to us that she's dead all of us he opened the eyes and she looked up she says bull why did you call me back I was born entering the beautiful gates and there's beautiful birds flying around everywhere he said what are you talking about he says bull this is heaven you're preaching about it amen say there is a land over there then we had a chat she didn't say Oh bull you know what i'ma lighten up Lisa you know yeah can I get from here and go with you no she was you know she's gonna go she was just given that a grace of God to open that and never check with the Prophet and he had a chat and she said well promise me you won't preach to those people that those poor people he says that's a reason why this happened I was about to drink those beautiful gates and he called me they praise the Lord see that's what we went to Basel and see so he said lord help us we just want to believe in place on the devil so we were said ABBA but why must we believe this message you know is it only through this messy but the Prophet tells us those who believe no one's message only and no matter all the opposite occator him against noah and they didn't want to believe he said God said so God said so isn't it'll be a flood God said so so we can apply the same word today God said so amen those who come out of the ministry not this Minister malicious is barreling north this each junction of time see many mysteries in the world you know Jesus is preaching in Israel again not by their minds the teachers Jesus is preached in Israel I put some posted on what's up we must have seen those things and when they preaching Jesus please alone and the problem is the Word of God tells us where the gospel go back to the Jews how glorious is gonna be amen so we press on the devil give him all the glory give him all the praise see so he's going to see through this message that God raised up a prophet and those seven angels came down it was list now this is right there with the pasta around filthy listen they got the virus in Phoenix Arizona right their way see this thing happen that was in fresh stuff name they were in Phoenix see so it was right over there contact to the starting from the east go to the West plays along see so this message came to call out a bride that's why I said now when the profit will we have the capital of time he was a leader there was no other leaders for the bride day amen see so if our names who they will come for the problem said that word must strike that heart if we were predestined then we are picking a man we come to life amen so not everybody can believe this message people attend the back Sunday they have said all manner of things and and everything else but there's a predestined right and God brought us here for his glory he made us bypass of theosophy for his glory amen to show their enemy and he'll ever bright here place the rock so we press on the battle and give him all place I want to say brother crush on you you look terrific this morning I was going to say your work list you look at that lovely rose thing over there I mean even like a bridegroom phrase along I'm sitting there I
