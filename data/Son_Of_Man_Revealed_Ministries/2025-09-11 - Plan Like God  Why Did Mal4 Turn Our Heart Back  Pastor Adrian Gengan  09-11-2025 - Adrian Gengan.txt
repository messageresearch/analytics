TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm feeling a bit lightheaded. So, just pray God strength. I think it's the heat. &gt;&gt; Not many of you were here on Wednesday where I mentioned that I was brought up in a stormtrooper background. But nonetheless, I've seen God God's hand from a little baby. So, I can stand here confidently and say that I'm a living testimony of what God has done in my life and what he's still doing in my life. &gt;&gt; I pray this song will be a blessing.

You know, each one of us carry a measure of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you're not here, we definitely miss that portion of the faith that you're carrying. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And uh this morning, Amen. Want to welcome our brother Paul. Amen. Let's give him a hand as we welcome. Amen. Amen. Is visiting with us this morning. So we pray the Lord will bless him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we have uh brother Kenyan family up in Johannesburg this this weekend. Amen. So we pray that the Lord will be with them back safe traveling mercies. Amen. You ready for the word of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We also want to appreciate the song. Amen. Our sister Kim sang. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our life is a living &gt;&gt; breathing testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It must manifest from the pages of this book into flesh. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's turn to Revelation chapter 10. We'll read our portion of scripture there. Amen. If it had not been for Revelation 10, &gt;&gt; we wouldn't be sitting here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, young people, just pay attention to the scripture as well. This is the message that we believe. It says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, &gt;&gt; the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So everything about God now that the seventh angel has sounded, it's finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are living in that time and season now where it's finished. Let's turn to uh Amen. Deuteronomy 29:29. Praise the Lord. Deuteronomy 29:29 says, "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed belong unto us &gt;&gt; and to our children forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; That we may do all the words of this law. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the secret things that have been revealed to us by Revelation 10:7 belong to us and our children. &gt;&gt; And our children's children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So the Lord blessings through the reading of his word. You may be seated. We turn to one more portion of scripture. Psalm 84:10. Amen. also. Amen. Good to see our brother sitting in the back there. Amen. God bless you this morning. Amen. Psalm 84 and:e 10 says, "For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many of you can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. A day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Than to dwell in the tent of wickedness. &gt;&gt; For the Lord God is a son and a shield. &gt;&gt; For the Lord will give grace and glory. No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Some of you didn't uh comprehend that. &gt;&gt; No good thing &gt;&gt; will he uphold withhold from them that walk up rightly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is at this time he's not withholding anything from us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now last week we were speaking on God's planning. How God plans and we were showing you how planning is an attribute of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He planned redemption from before the foundation of the world. And we were looking at this now and we were just want to progress the thought a bit. Amen. And show you how God plans ahead of time. If we just look maybe at the story of David for a while. Amen. You know, God had planned David to be king. Amen. Before Goliath came in on the scene. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God planned ahead of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; God anointed ahead of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God didn't wait for Goliath to come in on the scene and then now try and look for a man. &gt;&gt; God had already trained a man. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; God had already prepared a man. &gt;&gt; God had already anointed a man. &gt;&gt; So when the time came the man can step forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God also did not wait for Saul to die before he anointed David to be king. Saul was now an ex &gt;&gt; anointed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But yet he's king, &gt;&gt; but he's no more anointed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this is a kingdom principle. We've got to understand kingdom principles. &gt;&gt; We find many churches are in disarray because the pastor died and the church doesn't know how to move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let's see how God plans. Yes. &gt;&gt; God planned ahead of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He made a way for the children of Israel by anointing another man. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew that Saul would not be able to meet the challenge of the hour. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, he raised a man, anointed him, &gt;&gt; and one day it looked like by chance, but this was not chance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, according to the Israelite people itself, they thought that the army of Israel was brave men, &gt;&gt; warriors. &gt;&gt; They were fighting the Philistines. That was THEIR IMPRESSION OF WHAT WAS GOING ON in the army. Remember, they didn't have cell phones. &gt;&gt; They didn't have somebody videoing there and showing these Israelites trembling in their boots. SO THEIR IMPRESSION OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE WAR scene was that the children of Israel were fighting &gt;&gt; and overcoming. &gt;&gt; Little did they know. Amen. And David now will give us an insight into how what was happening there on the scene &gt;&gt; because his father now creates an opportunity for him to go onto the front lines. BUT GOD IS GOING TO USE the situation to bring the anointed man TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; SO, it it LOOKS LIKE A SIMPLE ACT. Take an epha of roasted grain. Now, if you don't know what that is, some of you like fried meies. &gt;&gt; So, his father sent fried meies. &gt;&gt; Are we reading that? Okay, if you find that in the book, you'll see that he sent him roasted grain. He sent 10 loaves of bread and 10 cheese to the brothers at the camp. Amen. Now, this sending forth would lead him to his destiny. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever God is leading you, it's leading you to your destiny, &gt;&gt; TO YOUR PURPOSE, &gt;&gt; TO UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL THAT'S laying within you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO ASK OURSELVES, HOW ARE WE handling our current encounters, trials, and temptations and testing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, God plans ahead of time. So, God already let him have an encounter with the bear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he killed the bear. GOD LET HIM ENCOUNTER A LION AND HE KILLED A LION. He couldn't understand why God was presenting him challenges like this. &gt;&gt; Why such ferocious animals? &gt;&gt; Because there would be a ferocious &gt;&gt; Philistine. &gt;&gt; Amen. God was sending ferocious animals. God wasn't sending small little things over there. &gt;&gt; He sent a bear. &gt;&gt; He sent a lion. He's sending sickness your way. &gt;&gt; He's sending persecution your way. &gt;&gt; He's sending problem AFTER PROBLEM YOUR WAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You're wondering WHY YOU'RE IN THE SITUATION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD IS PREPARING YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; For your final victory over the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, your past experiences we are learning from this is preparing YOU FOR YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT'S LAYING AHEAD. &gt;&gt; SO, DON'T QUESTION GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OURS IS NOT TO QUESTION WHY. GOD KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, maybe you're questioning, Lord, why couldn't I grow UP IN A BETTER ENVIRONMENT? WHY COULDN'T I GROW up in a BETTER HOME? WHY COULDN'T MY CIRCUMSTANCES be different? David didn't go back to his father and say, "What can you know children of today?" &gt;&gt; Entitled. &gt;&gt; If it was a 21st century child, &gt;&gt; what they call them generation alpha, what what gen are we now? Autumn we in Gen 8 alpha they would have said what can't father you sending me there lion is coming you sending me there bear is coming you don't care for me &gt;&gt; today's children would have said that &gt;&gt; you're very irresponsible &gt;&gt; I'm going to call child line for you &gt;&gt; today's children would have done that &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; now you tell them before we should hiding &gt;&gt; now. You tell them go face the corner, they're crying. &gt;&gt; You give them a time out, they already crying. They can't handle pressure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he didn't question his father, why you put me out here to take care of the sheep? And remember, whatever God has given you, protect it with your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be a good steward of what GOD HAS GIVEN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS GIVEN charge over the sheep and he protected it with his very own life. &gt;&gt; God saw I can use a man like this. &gt;&gt; If he can risk his life to take care OF SHEEP, HOW MUCH MORE WILL HE LEAD MY PEOPLE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID I FOUND A MAN AFTER my own heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This man when he HAD SINNED LATER ON HE WAS ONE THAT OUT OF REPENTANCE AND HE SAID LORD TAKE NOT THY HOLY SPIRIT FROM ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RESTORE UNTO ME THE JOY OF THY SALVATION. LET'S CONTRAST THAT WITH SAUL. SAUL KNEW GOD HAD REJECTED HIM. BUT HE WAS SO PROUD. &gt;&gt; YOU WON'T READ SAUL SAYING, "LORD, OH, TAKE NOT THY HOLY spirit from me. &gt;&gt; Don't take your anointing from me, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; SOL DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF A HEART. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND IT HAS TO DO WITH CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO DON'T CRY AND ASK GOD WHY THE BEAR. &gt;&gt; DAVID DIDN'T SAY, "OH, YAMA, THE bear is coming and running." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He stood AND HE FACED THE CHALLENGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. What is God doing? Shaping and molding your character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Making you be able to handle the power that's going to be unleashed through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? There's a power going to be unleashed through you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because power, Saul had power without character. &gt;&gt; Let's take that example what the prophet says. Now Saul had power without character and he was not fit to rule. &gt;&gt; But David, David had power with character and he was fit to rule. So therefore God set him up as the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know Saul as well is a example of modern day preachers in the message as well. &gt;&gt; He came over there and Saul showed him his armor. &gt;&gt; The armor was for protection. Somebody tell me the word is for protection. The word is our protection. &gt;&gt; You agree? The word is our protection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saul could explain what the third pool can do. &gt;&gt; Are somebody listening to me? &gt;&gt; BUT SAUL HIMSELF AT THAT TIME, HE DIDN'T WHY DIDN'T HE HAVE THE ARMOR ON HIMSELF? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE BIBLE DESCRIBES SAUL, THE BIBLE SAYS HE WAS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE MOST SUITED man to take on Goliath. &gt;&gt; That's right. BUT IN THE TIME OF THE CHALLENGE OF THE HOUR, THIS MAN was without his armor, &gt;&gt; but he was busy explaining TO DAVID, YOU KNOW, IF YOU PUT ON this armor here, &gt;&gt; you can go out there and challenge him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't live higher than you preach. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me about the third pool if you can't manifest the third pool. Oh, brother, this is what the third pool can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Show me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How many years we going to hear about the third pull and what it can do? &gt;&gt; You don't have the armor on. He couldn't manifest what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; But he wanted somebody else to put on his armor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't take on somebody else's experience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we are learning here. Amen. That Saul had the mechanics, &gt;&gt; but he didn't have the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is this econom? &gt;&gt; Just check. It's a bit warm here. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Saul had the mechanics, but he didn't have the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He could explain to David the mechanics, but could not produce the dynamics. He could not manifest what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People can preach and explain to us the deep mysteries of God, but it must manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Saul, we are learning, was no longer the mouthpiece of God. &gt;&gt; We're going somewhere with this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Saul was no longer the mouthpiece of God. &gt;&gt; David was now the mouthpiece of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is God's program for 2025? &gt;&gt; God's program is being known, made known through you and me. If anybody wants TO SEE THE REVIVAL THAT'S HAPPENING, if anybody wants to know the program of God, YOU MUST POINT them to yourself. &gt;&gt; I am THE PROGRAM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I AM WHAT GOD IS CURRENTLY DOING ON THE EARTH RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; NOW, let's ask ourselves one question. Why did God Why did God send Malachi 4:5 and 6, the prophet Elijah the prophet? Put it up, brother. For those that maybe don't know it, the younger ones especially. Amen. Let's put up the scripture itself. Amen. It says, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord." Who is God going to send? Somebody say, "Me." Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, people think this scripture is about the prophet. &gt;&gt; He's talking to you. Behold, I sent you &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; William Brandom. &gt;&gt; Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm talking to you. I'm sending you a prophetic ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What is he going to do? He shall turn, we know this is twofold, right? The first part was John the Baptist. Turn the heart of the fathers to the children. And the second part, the heart of the children to their fathers, lest they come and smite the earth with a curse. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now pay attention to this. Ask ourselves now. Then why did God send Malachi 4 to turn our hearts back? &gt;&gt; Why must our hearts be turned back? &gt;&gt; Who wants to answer? &gt;&gt; Okay, everybody's everybody's reasoning now. Why did God send us a prophet to turn our hearts back? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now remember, God is a God of purpose. &gt;&gt; God is a God of a plan. He has a purpose in doing this. &gt;&gt; Amen. So why? Now we're going to take it from the prophet. How many of you want the prophet to answer it and not Adrien Genan? &gt;&gt; How many of you want the prophet to answer it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We've been given a prophetic gift for a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if I give you the answer, you're going to say, "See that Bruna, he's trying to inject something there." &gt;&gt; Let's see what the prophet says why our hearts are turned back. We might read a bit, but I want you to understand what we are reading. Amen. And see why. So the this is just a summary, right, of what the prophet is saying. It's taken from resume of the ages. And the prophet is saying, "For seven out of the for seven out of the seven ages, I have seen nothing but men esteeming their own word above mine." &gt;&gt; Hey, it mustn't happen in the message. Eh, &gt;&gt; people esteeming their word above God's word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, at this end of the age, I'm spewing you out of my mouth. Ladies here, &gt;&gt; gone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's all over. I'm going to speak. All right. Yes. I am here in the midst of the church. The amen of God, faithful and true, will reveal himself and it will be by my prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pay attention now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he reads Revelation 10:7. As it was, Amen. In the days of the voice of the seven messenger, when he shall be given the son, the mystery shall be finished. There it is. He's sending a vindicated prophet. He's sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years. He's sending someone who is so far from organization, education, world of religion that as John the Baptist and Elijah of old, he will hear only from God and he will have thus sayith the Lord and speak for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Watch how he's going to time Malachi 4 to this ministry. Now he will be God's mouthpiece as he as he had declared in Malachi 46 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers here. Now he will bring the elect of the last day that they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul. He will restore the truth as they had it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember that is dealing with Elijah the prophet &gt;&gt; what he will do. &gt;&gt; But we WANT TO SEE OUR PART IN IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He's going to go right next to our part now. How many of you ready for our part? &gt;&gt; Amen. And those elect with him in that day will be the ONES WHO TRULY MANIFEST THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Why is HE TURNING OUR HEARTS BACK? &gt;&gt; TO MANIFEST THE LORD. &gt;&gt; MANIFEST means to make known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Lord will be made known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Are we paying attention? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First part, they will truly manifest the Lord. Second part, be his body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Third part, BE HIS VOICE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Why is he turning our hearts? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To manifest him &gt;&gt; to be his body. &gt;&gt; TO BE HIS VOICE. DOES it end there? &gt;&gt; To do what? Perform his works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Hallelujah. Do you see it?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you now know why our hearts have been turned back? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet gives us the answer to make known Christ to be his body to be his voice and to perform his works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We tying this in with Saul not being the mouthpiece and us being the mouthpiece. We are the David of today, right? He says a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is. In the dark ages, the word was almost entirely lost to the people. But God sent Luther with the word. The Lutheran spoke for God at that time. They organized the pure word lost for organization tense towards dogma and creeds. Not simple word. They could no longer speak for God. &gt;&gt; Then God sent Wesley. Same thing happened. Right? Then now watch what he says. The people who took his revelation from God became living epistles read and known of all men for their generation. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we the living epistles ready and known for today? &gt;&gt; Amen. Pay attention now. Amen. When the Methodists failed, God raised up others so that it has gone on through the years until in this last day, there is again another people in the land. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has a plan. God knows what he's doing. There's a people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The church denominations now is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It's his own mouthpiece. God is turning on her. He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe me, THEY ARE ALREADY CONFOUNDED BY THIS PROPHET. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That part has already been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE CONFOUNDED BY THIS PROPHET. &gt;&gt; YEAH. Honest men when you find their reviews on YouTube, they can't understand how the power of God was used so mightily in this man was displayed so mightily through this man. &gt;&gt; They don't understand Luke 17:30, right? &gt;&gt; Why will he confound her through the prophet and the bride? The voice of God will be &gt;&gt; in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we know why our hearts have been turned back. The voice of God to be in us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. It says in Revelation verse 17, Amen. last chapter of Revelation verse 17, the spirit and the bride say come once more. The world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost. But of course the word bride will be repudiated. That means rejected as in the first age. &gt;&gt; Now he has cried out. I I put this part here because I want message people to wake up. He says he cried out in this last age. You have the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU HAVE MORE BIBLES THAN EVER. YOU HAVE MORE SPOKEN WORDS THAN EVER. But you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want. You are not interested in living it but debating it. This is the prophet. Now &gt;&gt; people are not interested in living this message but more interested in debating it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Concludes with this. God still has a voice for the people of the world. What is this voice given to us for now? Let's follow the thought. Why did he turn our hearts? We must be the voice of God. The mouthpiece of God, &gt;&gt; right? Why the mouthpiece of God? God. What is his who who is his voice for? Let me ask you that way. Who is his voice sent for? Now, let's follow the thought. The prophet was sent for you. When you become the mouthpiece, who are you sent for? The prophet is saying God still has a voice for the people of the world. &gt;&gt; Your voice is meant for the people of the &gt;&gt; world. Even as he has given a voice to the bride, the voice is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your voice is meant for the people of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Your voice is meant for the people of the world. &gt;&gt; You know me, I only like to fellowship with the believers. You know when you're eating food? How many of you eating chicken anytime or eating food and there's no salt? &gt;&gt; The other day I was eating food at work and the the food didn't have much salt in it. And I was looking for salt everywhere. I couldn't find salt. Jesus said, "You are the salt." &gt;&gt; You know how it felt the kale? I couldn't find salt anywhere. And I thought if I could only find some salt, this curry will taste so much better. &gt;&gt; And that's how the world feels. &gt;&gt; The world is eating nonsense. No salt. &gt;&gt; But you are the salt. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SALT, BUT THEY CAN'T FIND YOU. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope you're catching my analogy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; OR IF I COULD JUST HAVE SOME SALT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; My career would be better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're looking for you. YOU ARE THE SALT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WALKING IN GROSS DARKNESS. IF I COULD ONLY HAVE SOME LIGHT. JESUS SAID, "YOU ARE THE LIGHT." &gt;&gt; You know, me and me, I only fellowship with eagles. &gt;&gt; I only stay around the eagles. &gt;&gt; You're not like Jesus then. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They condemned Jesus. said, "Why are you there with the sinners?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; Let your light shine so before &gt;&gt; men. &gt;&gt; Your light must shine before men. &gt;&gt; You're blinding us here &gt;&gt; because all of us have light. Now you come with your own light. You know when you put headlights on and you moving there, you're blinding us &gt;&gt; because you're only bringing your light here and showing us how much you know here. &gt;&gt; That's right. Soon as you go in the world, you switch your torch off. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Me, I'm undercover agent. Nobody knows. No, I got light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You come in the church here, as soon as you enter the door, you switch your torch, you blind us. &gt;&gt; No, bro. That's not right. That's not right. Everything is not right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our light must shine outside. &gt;&gt; We must be a living testimony wherever we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You don't like that? But anyway, it's a word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he's going to give you a voice, but there must be something that accompanies the voice. &gt;&gt; He says, "This age started just at the turn of the 20th century as it was to be in the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost." &gt;&gt; We know that there must of necessity &gt;&gt; be a RETURN OF DYNAMIC POWER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's necessary right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. for there TO BE A RETURN OF DYNAMIC POWER. &gt;&gt; I'M TIRED OF A POWERLESS GOSPEL. TIRED OF A POWERLESS RELIGION. AMEN. WE NEED THE POWER of God back in the church &gt;&gt; like IT WAS AT PENTECOST. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT PENTECOST, READ THE BOOK OF ACTS. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; WE NEED THE POWER OF GOD TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THE CHURCH &gt;&gt; WHERE A MAN SITTING AT THE GATE beautiful and say, "OH, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HAVE MERCY on me. Give me something." &gt;&gt; Right. AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Give them something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter and John do not have money. &gt;&gt; But what they had, THEY GAVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; STOP TELLING PEOPLE YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Tell them I don't have the money, but what I have, I'm going TO GIVE YOU RIGHT NOW. PRAY FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GIVE THEM SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger of to this age in will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning. That is thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you know thus say the Lord don't fail? &gt;&gt; This is your prophet now. &gt;&gt; This is the last prophet to the Gentiles. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He is saying that they will return back to the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning. &gt;&gt; This is thus say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; This is uniting time. Amen. You see churches uniting. You see religions uniting. You see, Amen. nations uniting. The prophet of God is saying here, Amen. Amen. It's uniting time for God and his bride, too. &gt;&gt; I say this with respect and reverence. I believe the bride is called. I believe she's sealed into the kingdom of God. I believe the mechanics is there. They're waiting for the dynamics that will take her off the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're waiting for David to come. David brought the mechanics. Dynamics. &gt;&gt; Hey, David brought the dynamics to Israel that day. &gt;&gt; They are waiting for David to rise in on the scene. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. waiting for the dynamics to take off the earth into glory in the rapture. I believe with all my heart, we don't know how he's going to do it, but he's going to do it. He is the dynamics. Amen. We just become members of the machine of his body, forming ourselves into his image. We're going to with a purpose. Amen. Watch. Watch now what he says. We are forming ourselves into his image. And see him uniting himself with us in his works. How is he uniting himself with us? &gt;&gt; In his works. So where must the works be seen? Through me. &gt;&gt; With his love gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As he hands them out to us when at the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; Somebody read with me. He's going to hand out these love gifts at the wedding supper because you know a wedding ceremony has already taken place. Where do people bring the gifts? Somebody say to the reception. &gt;&gt; Some of you still owe people gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Where is he going to hand out the gifts? Love gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody read with me. &gt;&gt; Just before the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; So you mean now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THEN SAY, LORD, GIVE ME THE LOVE GIFTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let your works be displayed through me. I WANT THE LOVE GIFTS as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. What is this dynamics you're talking about? How many of you don't know what the dynamics is? &gt;&gt; How many of you want to know what the dynamics is? He's saying the must come dynamics to the church. &gt;&gt; Let's see what he's saying. The dynamics is the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People want to be refilled once once they want to be filled. Go read the book of Acts. They got fulfilled in got filled in acts chapter 2 but in acts chapter 4 they went for a refilling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He saying the dynamics coming to this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit &gt;&gt; that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body. &gt;&gt; The intelligence is coming down to unite with the body. &gt;&gt; If you don't know what that is the cloud of 1963 &gt;&gt; Christ has come down &gt;&gt; to unite with the body. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says as they are uniting with the body, the dynamics will become to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But when the head and body unites together, the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that. Even the dead &gt;&gt; that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of holiness, take a flight to the skies. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm say you now understand why our hearts were turned back. &gt;&gt; We must become the voice &gt;&gt; of God. Our voice is meant for the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And through us also our hearts are turned back so that the works of God can be seen through us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So give the Lord the best that we can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Here now the prophet of s he's talking about this woman. You remember who brought the spike out of oil ointment? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And washed his feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody remember that. &gt;&gt; She wanted the best. She said he's deserving of the best. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch our approach to Sunday morning church. When we coming to church on a Wednesday as well, give him our best. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come, you know, we go for interviews, suddenly we're looking for ties. &gt;&gt; We want to make an impression. You go for a wedding, you don't wear nonsense. You put on your suits. Even if you don't have other people getting married, you going buying new suits. &gt;&gt; Amen. The sisters going to buy new dress. Why? You want to look your best. &gt;&gt; You want to look the part. &gt;&gt; We come to church. People think you're going to play soccer. Where are you going? You're going to the beach. No, I'm going to church. Why you dressed like that? &gt;&gt; Give God your best. The prophet of God says it now. We must give him our best. &gt;&gt; We must do our best. Is this the prophet saying it? He is deserving of the best. And he is. Don't give him a little corner. &gt;&gt; Give him all you got. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm trying to encourage you now. &gt;&gt; He deserves the BEST THAT YOU'VE GOT AND THE BEST THAT you can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all she had. That's she know she got it. She know how she got it. You see, you know how she got this. She was a loose woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But whatever money she made, &gt;&gt; she took it and she bought something for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. She didn't argue with him about the price. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That wasn't it. She just wanted the best. And if I flip the script and I show you, Jesus didn't ask, "Hey lady, where you bought this thing? Where the money came from?" &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't ask this woman where this money came from. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No. No. You got it through some, you know, you I'm trying to put my holy voice. You know, this money came by unsolicitated ways. You know, in this church, we don't take that kind of funds. Judas, I'm not saying I want unsolicited funds. I'm showing you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why are you thinking about me now? &gt;&gt; I'm asking you to think about what Jesus did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't ask where you got this money from. &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give him your best. &gt;&gt; Give him your best. Right? Don't be uphazard about serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's read what the prophet is saying here. Jesus never went and died on the cross or some appazit affair. &gt;&gt; He didn't treat it uphazard. &gt;&gt; This is salvation. THIS IS LIFE ETERNAL. WHY MUST WE treat it up as it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Imagine he's saying now imagine Jesus went on the cross. Perhaps somebody might feel sorry because he died. &gt;&gt; That's what denominations are doing now. They're preaching an emotional message, &gt;&gt; preaching to your flesh. &gt;&gt; They want you to feel sorry &gt;&gt; because he died so he can so they come to get saved, &gt;&gt; right? God doesn't run his business like that. God runs his business by fornowledge &gt;&gt; knowing before the world was ever formed who was his own. &gt;&gt; So Jesus died on the cross for all those names that were written in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that God would ever run his office in an appazit way. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't run mine. You wouldn't run yours either. How are we running our affairs? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Haphazard. How are we running our businesses? Are we running it like kingdom businesses? Amen. Are we a man of our word? Are we keeping to our promise? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we Amen. Are we bringing distribute to the gospel? Remember, we are representing God in all areas of our lives. Yes. &gt;&gt; When we go to school, we are representative of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; When we go to work, we are representatives of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; When we go, Amen. to business, we are representatives of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll find this in the message. I don't have the quote here, but you're going to find there. God says, uh, the prophet says there, if God made you a farmer, he says you are now supposed to associate with your business associates and witness to Christ about them, &gt;&gt; to them about Christ. He says, if you made a housewife, you witness to the neighbors. You witness to your friends about Christ. In whatever position he placed you in, you are there to represent the kingdom. &gt;&gt; God never does nothing. Just like we do. We just kind of up as a people just stroll along. Well, if this happens, it's all right. It's illegal to not have a plan &gt;&gt; according to Egyptian municipality. &gt;&gt; It's illegal to build without a plan. Amen. &gt;&gt; In God's kingdom, it's illegal to not have a plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To have a purpose for your life. &gt;&gt; So, you can't just be like, "Ah, you know, whatever happens, what you doing?" Nah, nothing, man. &gt;&gt; We'll see. You know me, I'm waiting on the Lord. I don't know what you're waiting for. &gt;&gt; Do you know that's a spiritual saying? &gt;&gt; To sound spiritual now. You don't have an answer for the brew. So, to keep him quiet, you know me, I'm waiting on the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you don't like that, but when I leave the port now, then you're going to see what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We just kind of strolling along. Oh, what if this happens? It's all right. And if that happens, it's all right. But God has a real definite meaning for everything he does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe if we are his servants, we would obey him. I believe the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't be a hazard about our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? The message that we have is not an appazit message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the pearl of great price. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Don't live life aimlessly without a purpose. Don't be drifting AND EXPECT GOD TO be pleased with us. Some of us feel like now the the song leader must now come here and announce now because you made an appearance to church today. &gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, giving us a guest appearance today. &gt;&gt; And we want God to be pleased with us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Things are not working out right in our life. Let me tell you why. I'm not a rocket scientist, but I can tell you why. &gt;&gt; You're not faithful to the things of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing will work out right because you're not faithful to the things of God. &gt;&gt; What does the Bible say? All things work together for the good of them that &gt;&gt; No. Me, I love God, but you'll never find me in his house. I love him from far. Me, I love God from far, but you'll never find him there by the things of God. You'll never find him on a prayer meeting. I love God from far. Because me, my favorite song, the love of God is greater far. They misunderstood that words now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody smile. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're in your father's house. Relax. &gt;&gt; I don't know why you're getting stressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have fun anywhere else. You can't come here and rejoice in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some so religiously now like we said, you know, I'm waiting on the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, the only time you're supposed to wait on the Lord when you're weak. &gt;&gt; You apply that scripture for every other thing in your life. The Bible says they they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. So if you got no strength, go wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; But now some people are full of strength. They're still waiting. You're supposed to wait on the Lord when your strength is weak. Now, Moses looks so holy. I'll give you some examples now. You say, "Give me examples. I feel like a lawyer and I have to prove everything." Moses looks so holy and so righteous at the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Amen. Crying at the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; CRYING AT YOUR PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; CRYING AT YOUR SITUATION. &gt;&gt; CRYING AT YOUR MOUNTAIN FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD SENT you and commissioned you, Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you're crying to him like a baby. &gt;&gt; He chose you for this purpose. HE COMMISSIONED YOU FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND YOU'RE GOING CRYING. &gt;&gt; Exodus 14:E 13. He tells the people, now watch, he sounds brave. MINISTRY CAN SOUND BRAVE TOO. &gt;&gt; Easy to command the people, stand still. SEE THE SALVATION OF THE LORD. WHAT HE WILL SHOW YOU TODAY FOR THE Egyptians whom you have seen today. You shall see them no more forever. &gt;&gt; THE LORD SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU AND YOU SHALL hold your peace. &gt;&gt; Watch now the Lord the Lord says to Moses, why cries out to me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Speak to the children of Israel THAT THEY GO FORWARD. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE COMMISSIONED FOR THIS TIME AND SEASON. SPEAK AND GO FORWARD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You know me, I'm just waiting here. The pastor never come to visit me. I'm waiting for him to come. WHY ARE YOU WAITING? GOD GAVE YOU THE POWER. GOD GAVE YOU THE AUTHORITY TO HANDLE THE DEMONS IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; I wasn't there WHEN YOU ALLOWED THE DEMON TO BIND YOU. &gt;&gt; Now I must come and I've unbind you. &gt;&gt; You allowed the demon to bind you. TELL ME I'M NOT SPEAKING the truth. The prophet said, "Where you left Jesus, &gt;&gt; that's where you'll find him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; NOW, I MUST COME LIKE the inspector gadget now and look where you left Jesus. &gt;&gt; I don't KNOW WHERE YOU LEFT JESUS. YOU KNOW WHERE YOU LEFT JESUS. &gt;&gt; YOU GO BACK AND YOU FIND I AM NOT A DETECTIVE. NEITHER ARE THE BROTHERS here detectives to come and find out where you left Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know where you left Jesus. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAYS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN FIND HIM, GO BACK, FIND WHERE YOU LEFT HIM AND INVITE HIM BACK. SOMEBODY GIVE GOD PRAISE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You must come now and counsel. You know, brother, what's happening? I don't know. Now, you don't know and I how you expect me to know. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You stop being honest. You know, brother, I'm backslitting. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm backslitten. You know, I stopped serving the Lord for so long. &gt;&gt; Be honest. &gt;&gt; Be like David, a man after God's own heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why are you crying to me? Speak and go forward. Speak and go forward. Speak and go forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because footsteps mean possession. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, that's one example. I mustn't stand and wait. Speak and go forward." Well, let's put up Acts. ACTS CHAPTER 1. NOW, THIS WOULD BE A MARVELOUS THING TO BEHOLD. JESUS ASCENDING TO HEAVEN. But look what the angels tell them. You men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven? &gt;&gt; You know, this is a sight to behold. I'm witnessing the Lord Jesus Christ ascend to heaven. I want to take it in. The angels are coming to tell them immediately, "This part of the drama is over." &gt;&gt; Nobody's getting this. They are witnessing the Lord ascend to heaven. &gt;&gt; But the plan is not over yet. &gt;&gt; The story is NOT OVER YET. GOD DOESN'T WANT YOU TO stand still now and wait and say, "Wow, look at this thing here. This great sight." The angel come and immediately tell them, "Why are you gazing?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why are you gazing up into heaven? He says, "This same Jesus which is taken up from from you unto heaven shall come again in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven." So this part of the drama is over. Why are you gazing? They wanted to take it in. They were in awe, but the angels expected them to move on to the next part. Where were they supposed to be? In the upper room. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Some are still gazing at the Mustri cloud of 1963. &gt;&gt; I am just in awe of this. But now it's 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's 2025. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's time to take your be cut and your bell bottoms from the 60s and put it away. It's 2025. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why you gazing? Still trying to understand it. WHY ARE YOU GAZING? Some read the message after 40 years they still don't know what the message is about. &gt;&gt; Ever learning. Yes. &gt;&gt; Never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. &gt;&gt; Some still don't understand the mysteries. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You say, "Why are you saying I mustn't stand and wait?" Let's see how the prophet, God dealt with the prophet. &gt;&gt; Our prophet was very honest. &gt;&gt; He denied nothing. &gt;&gt; If God rebuked him, he put it there in a sermon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is standing in the gap. Remember my point now. Why are we waiting? &gt;&gt; Who you waiting for? What you waiting for? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're the prophet. Now I this is now the prophet detailing what happened to him. He says I was told you had called me to be a prophet and I want to live in the wilderness like the prophet. You see it sounds so spiritual. You know a lot of people say you know me I want to go full-time. They gone fulltime and they're half time. &gt;&gt; They're not doing anything fulltime. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They waking up late. They're having breakfast late. They're doing nothing for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hello. &gt;&gt; How many of you know if you're going fulltime, &gt;&gt; you must go wake up and start job 8:00? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; that's true. &gt;&gt; You're saying, "Hey, bro, why you making it out for yourself? When you go fulltime, they're going to hold you to this. &gt;&gt; Come on." &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hear what the prophet is saying. He is saying, "I want you to go in the wilderness like a prophet of the whole." Why he saying? See, I was using my own excuse so I could hunt is &gt;&gt; this is honest prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's saying he wants to eat. He's bluffing them. He's going in the wilderness like the prophet. But he's saying, "Hey, I want to go hunt." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My own good. And he said, "But that was the prophets of the Old Testament. You've been called there in a much higher office than that." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you have greater gifts and greater talents, but you've been called to a much higher place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Get out of the situation you're in right now. &gt;&gt; Let's read. He said you HAVE MORE GIFTS BESIDE THAT. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You have more gifts beside that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You were called to pray for the sick and preach the gospel. and the apo and in the apostolic form you know of greater things many great gifts &gt;&gt; he said why do you wait for me here we going now &gt;&gt; why do you wait for me to move every time you move &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; you know me I'm just waiting on the Lord the Lord finished commission you go into all the world &gt;&gt; preach the gospel &gt;&gt; make disciples of all men &gt;&gt; theord God already anointed you.

Go ask somebody now after the service. Go ask them. Jesus says, "The harvest is plentiful. &gt;&gt; My laborers are few." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Pray the Lord of the harvest will send laborers into the vineyard." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We need to pick the atmosphere up now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What it is? It's wrong to wait. It's wrong to wait.

God is looking for sons AND DAUGHTERS WHERE POWER WILL BE PUT INTO THE CHURCH. It will so anoint the people.

Hallelujah. The reason why we are not receiving back 100fold, the reason back why we are not seeing this, we are NOT GIVING OURSELVES AWAY BECAUSE THERE'S SCRIPTURE. THERE'S A LAW THAT SAYS GIVE. &gt;&gt; Luke 6:38. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason whatever situation we are find ourselves in right now is because of what we have sown. &gt;&gt; You reap what you sow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, you know in our own lives where we let down the bars. &gt;&gt; When we were letting down the bars, when we were after our own selves, we were sowing. &gt;&gt; You sow to the wind and now you're reaping a world win. &gt;&gt; You sowed for that. &gt;&gt; Now you're not happy about the harvest. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

Whatever you give to the Lord is going to come back to you 100fold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, he says God is good. He wants us to get the best that we have. I'm closing with this now. He wants us to get the best that we have. God wants you to have the best. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "God wants me to have the best." &gt;&gt; God wants me to have the best. &gt;&gt; We his children, he wants to give us the best that there is. Somebody said the message of the hour is the best thing you could ever give me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I know some of you are thinking about that uno you were looking at. &gt;&gt; God wants to give you the best. He gave you the best thing he could give you. &gt;&gt; Yes.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, then in all other areas of your life, &gt;&gt; I was telling brother Romesh the other day, remember our conversation? We were talking about gyra. We were talking about healer. You know, we very spiritual in other talks too. You know the material things don't matter to me. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; When he's coming with seven compound names. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he's Rafa, is he coming as Rafa? You need healing now. You're sick. Say you got cancer. How many of you need spiritual healing then? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Who needs spiritual healing when they got cancer in their body? &gt;&gt; Yes. How many of you will pray Lord heal me spiritually &gt;&gt; or do you need physical healing? &gt;&gt; So as Jehovah Rafa is coming to heal you physically &gt;&gt; nobody wants to walk with me &gt;&gt; when your peace and your joy is taken away. Jehovah shalom must he come spiritually and give you peace or must he come and give you physical peace &gt;&gt; salvation of your soul. &gt;&gt; What about gyra? Amen. &gt;&gt; Who knows what gyra is? &gt;&gt; Swami if you want to provide spiritual only &gt;&gt; or you think that's physical. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; No, because you know why? Uh because when Abraham was uh the pal when when Abraham was sacrificing there Isaac, they needed a spiritual lamb to come. &gt;&gt; What he needed? &gt;&gt; So why we talk spiritual? All the seven redemptive names are to meet men's physical needs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. God will bless us spiritually. In fact, we are defeating our words because Ephesians tells us we are already blessed. &gt;&gt; Is it 1:3? Ephesians 1:3. Hey, how can we go ask God for something it's already there? You know, we got very nice prayers. Lord, bless me. Lord, uh physically, but above all, spiritually. Hey, who prays that prayer? Come on now. Nobody wants to hear this truth. We are praying graffited prayers. &gt;&gt; You hear so spiritually. Lord bless us physically but above all spiritually. But you you are you are praying a prayer that hits the ceiling and come down because God says here we are blessed with all spiritual blessings already. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you don't need spiritual blessings. &gt;&gt; Who's hearing me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You already have spiritual blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you need physical? &gt;&gt; Somebody choking and saying what do you need? &gt;&gt; Physical. Hey, I'm just reading the Bible here. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath &gt;&gt; blessed us &gt;&gt; with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that prayer you heard some denominational person pray, please stop repeating it. &gt;&gt; And when you are praying, I want fresh prayers. &gt;&gt; You can't be praying every week and you're saying the same words. Every week you say the same prayer. That's not talking to father. Every week they make you pray. Every week you say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Prayer is communication. &gt;&gt; I'm saying what's on this every week he say to me. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Prayer is talking to your father. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Imagine every day you only have two words of hello. How are you? every day, 30 days in a month, 365 days a year, you only say hello, how are you? Hello, how are you? Hello, how are you? Same prayer. Prayer is supposed to be communication to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you're not supposed to be praying from your flesh, man. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be praying from your spirit man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I better get out the school picture. People waiting with daggers here for me. Amen. Proverbs 10 and verse4. This is a person now we slack. He become athlet that dealth with a slack hand. Lazy hand. &gt;&gt; Who's this person? Hey, I'm reading Bible. &gt;&gt; Some of you don't want to say amen to the Bible. &gt;&gt; He becometh poor that dealth with a slack hand. But the hand of the diligent maketh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be lazy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's trying to force his way into you. Everything he can. Ask abundantly that your joys might be full. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of you must try it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You got no joy. Jesus is saying, "Ask abundantly that your joy may be full." &gt;&gt; What's he trying to do? Force it to you. You're saying, "Pastor, why every week you're preaching this thing?" In some way, you're bringing it. I'm trying to force it into you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ask abundantly that your joy may be full. He wants his people to be happy. &gt;&gt; Ask great things believing for great things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are a city on the hill. High ambitions, expectations. &gt;&gt; If we see the blind receive it sight tonight, I want to see the dead raised tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be satisfied with one thing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Have higher expectation. I saw the blind man healed. I'm expecting resurrection of the dead. &gt;&gt; And I want you to just keep on believing for greater things. Who's believing for greater things? &gt;&gt; I want you to keep believing for greater things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm telling you, don't be satisfied with your current situation. &gt;&gt; David didn't run back and tell his father, you know, you you know, you couldn't you made me handle the bear. You made me handle the lion. Now, even worse, there there's one goliath there. Own your situation. &gt;&gt; God put you there for a reason. &gt;&gt; Come on. God put you there for a reason. God raised you up for this reason to defeat your &gt;&gt; Goliath. children to have the best that there is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, bro, I wish the prophet never said this. Some of you so offended. &gt;&gt; God thinks the same way about his children because he's a parent. He wants his children to have the best that there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're here to pray and hold with you together for the promises of God until you get your heart desired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are we here to do? We are here to pray and hold with you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because if two or more agree upon anything, &gt;&gt; we are here to hold together with you until you get your heart's desire. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you're sick, we are praying with you until you get your heart's desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're in lack or you need, we are here to hold and pray with you until you get your heart's desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we know that he will give it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one thing that we have to move up now is to supreme faith. &gt;&gt; You cannot have faith until you perfectly know what you're doing. You know, and there he describes faith. Now, he says faith is as good as you saying, I'm going to start the car. He says it's an act of faith. You just believe the car is going to start. He says, "Tomorrow I'll meet you at a certain place." That's an act of faith. You've done it so much &gt;&gt; because it's a regular routine with you. &gt;&gt; That's the way with the things of God. After you have trusted him and watched him do it so many things till it just becomes a regular routine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The supernatural becomes routine to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The supernatural becomes routine to you. &gt;&gt; The supernatural becomes part of your everyday life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the condition I think the church will be just before the coming of the Lord. Are we just before the coming of the Lord now? &gt;&gt; So the rapture will go right that way. The regular routine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And following the scriptures and the plans of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you are ready to receive now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to close. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you are ready to receive? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you this one thing and I'm closing. I promise you I'll be closed in the next couple minutes. When you go to Matthew 9:22, you'll see Jesus saying to the woman who touched the hem of his garment, "Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am saying this morning, it's going to take your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now, whatever you believe in the Lord for, trusting the Lord for, it's going to take your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Jesus faith that made a whole. &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "Daughter, thy faith &gt;&gt; had made thee whole." &gt;&gt; And the woman was whole from that hour. You hear what the prophet says? God hadn't shown him anything. God didn't show Jesus anything about this woman. That's right. But the woman's faith that touched that gift. &gt;&gt; When the Lord ascended on I, he gave gifts unto men. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you something here. Now, pay attention &gt;&gt; cuz you're going to receive something right now if you can touch the gift of God. &gt;&gt; What was it? The woman with her faith had contacted God through the son of God. &gt;&gt; Apply the same principle this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can contact God through his gift. &gt;&gt; The woman with her faith had contacted God through the son of God and had drawn from the son of God her &gt;&gt; that was the woman using God's gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear what he says now as I close. God gives things after preaching is &gt;&gt; so who's asking right now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's going to draw? &gt;&gt; Amen. right now. &gt;&gt; He says God gives things after preaching his word. &gt;&gt; Sending preachers, he puts gifts. He's not willing that any should perish. &gt;&gt; He wants you to what? Don't you read properly. He wants you to &gt;&gt; He wants you to be &gt;&gt; He died for what purpose? &gt;&gt; You mean he died for me to prosper? &gt;&gt; Hey, come on. Let's read. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read it again. He wants you to He wants you to be &gt;&gt; healthy. &gt;&gt; He died for that purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romesh Jesus died for you to prosper. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus died for you to be healthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He does everything that there is even appearing himself to prove it to you. And still some people sit back. See some people are sitting back now. Ah, you know, he's like a denomination preacher. Now, &gt;&gt; I am not a denomination preacher. I read all quotes to you. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, call the prophet a denominational preacher. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Was it my quotes? &gt;&gt; It was a prophet's quotes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I read back the prophet's quotes. &gt;&gt; So, if you are insulting me and calling me a denominational preacher, prosperity preacher, you are insulting the prophet. &gt;&gt; Hello. Come on. I'm picking up the spirit. That's why I'm dealing with it. &gt;&gt; Oh, preach it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it again. Let's stand. He wants &gt;&gt; Somebody say me. &gt;&gt; To prosper. &gt;&gt; He wants me. &gt;&gt; He wants me &gt;&gt; to be healthy. &gt;&gt; to be healthy. &gt;&gt; He died for that &gt;&gt; purpose. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But spirits don't die. I see. And still people sit back then say, "Well, it's mental telepathy. It's mind readading. It's of the devil." This is not of the devil. &gt;&gt; This is of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to drink and push out all of God's plan for your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Receive it. Receive it. Receive it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Remember what he said. The woman touched the M of his garment by using God's gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you want right now? &gt;&gt; The gift of God is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Undeniable.

You see, people only want prosperity of their soul.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Some I don't want to say this, but let me say it. I don't know if you're ready. &gt;&gt; Some people souls are in heavenly places, &gt;&gt; but physically in hell. Sure. &gt;&gt; But he says, "All things thou mayest prosper and be in health &gt;&gt; even as thy soul prosperth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let your soul be in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; You are a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing a song. Amen. Praise the Lord. How many of you ready to sing? &gt;&gt; Worship him. Give me G. Amen. Let's put up that song for the church. My heart can sing when I pause to remember. A heartache here is but a stepping stone along a trail that's winding all ways upwards. This trbled world is not my final. The things of earth, the things of earth will dim and lose its value. If we recall, if they just borrowed for a while and all the things that cause you to trouble, remember they will only a smile. Let's sing until then. But until then, my heart will go singing.
