========================================

[Music] of the Lord. And there were words that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. meet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. We see the day fast approaching. &gt;&gt; We see times changing, seasons changing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the bride is also changing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we beholding him, we are changing into his very own image and likeness. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just want to wish our brother Luke a very happy birthday. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give him a hand. Amen. Turned 66 today. Don't let his looks deceive you. Amen. So he turned 66 today. So we pray the Lord will continue to be with him and bless him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's turn to the Bible. Praise the Lord. One Kings. Let's go to the book of one kings chapter 17. Read from verse one there. Amen. And Elijah the Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab, "As the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand, there shall not be due nor rain these years, but according to my word." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we know that the word of the Lord comes to a prophet. When he's saying it's my word, Amen. You got to understand who he's speaking there. Now, &gt;&gt; it's God veiled in a prophet. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "But according to my word," you would hear the prophet go on and dramatize it. Amen. We'll drop down to verse 9 there. So, we know he's first sustained at the brook. Amen. That the brook dries up. And he says in verse 9, "Arise, get thee to Zerapath, which belongth to Zidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee." So he arose and went to Zerapath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks. And he called to her and said, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel that I may drink." And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her and said, "Bring me, I pray, be thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand." Amen. Let's pray. Father, we thank you, Lord, for your precious word. We know, Lord, in your word is life, oh God. Lord, you have drawn yourself out in pattern, in type, and shadow through your Bible, oh God. And Lord, even as we come this evening to draw from your word, I pray, Lord, that you would be, Lord, come down and Lord, break the bread of life to us, Lord. And I pray, Father, even as you'll meet the need of the people, oh God, while the word is being spoken, Lord, I pray you'll discern their hearts and speak to every heart, oh God. Lord, we welcome you into this place and we want to give you the preeminence, the glory, and the honor. We commit all things into your precious and mighty name for your glory and for your honor with much thanksgiving. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Praise the Lord. Amen. And then I want to get to John 6:32. I can put that Josh should get my notes. Amen. So he says John John 6:32. So remember what Elijah asked for. He asked for water and then he asked for bread. &gt;&gt; Now we know that Jesus says that he was the living water. And he says now we're going to read. Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is that true bread? If they asking Jesus, now tell us. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And giveth life unto the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life. &gt;&gt; He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. &gt;&gt; So it's always got to do with bread and water. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll never hunger, you'll never thirst. Amen. Then we'll get to that first quote there. He's the prophet saying the hungry people looked to him one day found him and found sustaining bread a type the hungry today can find the bread of life not find a creed you don't find a founder you don't find a reformer you find life when you find Christ the bread of life &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; amen so if we get back to our story here amen we are looking at God veil in Elijah &gt;&gt; and When God is veiled in a prophet, that is son of man. &gt;&gt; God in a prophet is son of man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When he said to Ezekiel, son of man, prophesy again. &gt;&gt; God in a prophet is son of man. &gt;&gt; He's veiled in a prophet. Amen. So he's coming to &gt;&gt; Now watch how the Bible describes her. He says, "For there I have commanded a widow." &gt;&gt; Now if you go into invisible union, the prophet of God is saying the first husband must be dead. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says your first denominational husband must be dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order for Christ to come now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And be interested in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you have read that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have time to go into all of the quotes, but Amen. You are well taught to know that in that message, he's talking about the first husband must be dead. &gt;&gt; So then this woman is the perfect condition. She's in the perfect condition for the word to come to because her first husband is dead. &gt;&gt; This woman is a type of the church. &gt;&gt; Now, you know that there's there's three I think it's in John 5:17. He says there's three that bear record in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he says there's three on earth. He says there's water, blood, and spirit. &gt;&gt; And the prophet is typing that with a birth. Yes. &gt;&gt; He says that the first thing breaks is water, &gt;&gt; then blood. Blood is typing sacrifice &gt;&gt; and then spirit. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we're finding here that he says, "Arise, get thee to Zerapath, which belonging to Zidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a woman, a widow woman, specific &gt;&gt; first husband dead, &gt;&gt; perfect bing ground for the world, &gt;&gt; to sustain thee." So, not only does a prophet have a message, he's got to have a port, another part of the word to respond to his message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet couldn't bring a message or powerful message without there being a woman to receive that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the woman was going to give life to the prophet's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a portion of the word left for us &gt;&gt; just like how Eliza went to the woman at the well &gt;&gt; now I didn't make a mistake there. &gt;&gt; Rebecca was the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; She was at the well. &gt;&gt; Was she a woman? &gt;&gt; So Elisa went to the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; And he said give me &gt;&gt; to drink. But there was a portion of the word that he didn't speak to her. &gt;&gt; But because she was the word for that day, &gt;&gt; she said, "Not only will I give you, I'll give to your camels." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a portion of the word left for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which we must fulfill. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things the prophet left unspoken. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says sealed. He says some things I should take to my grave. But there's a lady on the earth. There's a woman on the earth who has the unspoken part &gt;&gt; and she is fulfilling the unspoken part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we find here he gets to the widow woman. Perfect condition of the word now. And he says he came to the gate and he says behold the woman was gathering sticks. So this woman is also not a lazy woman. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; She's about doing the things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She's she's at work in action. Amen. She's gathering sticks. You know the prophet types the sticks and he says it's the cross. Amen. So watch now. He says, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in the vessel that I may drink." &gt;&gt; And watch as she was going to fetch it, which means she had justification. &gt;&gt; The first portion is water. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She had justification. &gt;&gt; She had water. She was going to fetch it. &gt;&gt; Which means she had she had been now at the stage of loser's message. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But she needed something more because there was a famine in the land. &gt;&gt; And we know there's another famine in the land. Not for bread or water, but now for the true word of God. &gt;&gt; In this day and age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we can't only have water is what I'm trying to tell you. We can't totally have justification. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are finding the evidence that she has water. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now many people want to know or they question now this thought that God said I have commanded a widow woman. You read that there in the Bible. &gt;&gt; But the question is where did God command the widow woman? &gt;&gt; How many of you have heard that? &gt;&gt; Where does God command the widow woman? &gt;&gt; Because there's no record of it. But I can see it right here. It's staring at us. &gt;&gt; Where God commands the widow woman. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So he called to her and he said to her, "Fetch me, I pray thee." That sounds like somebody commanding someone. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; But you'll miss it if you don't know that God is veiled in Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's the command right there. Fetch thee, I pray thee, little water in a vessel that I may drink. So he sees she going. Amen. In verse 11, and as she's going, he commands her again. &gt;&gt; He called, he says, "Bring me, I pray, the immortal of bread in thine hand." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is commanding the widow woman through Elijah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Don't think you are hearing the words of a man when you are hearing William Brandham speak. &gt;&gt; God is commanding this bride through the prophet. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People are looking for a portion where God now comes and speaks secretly to the woman. &gt;&gt; No, God is speaking through Elijah. &gt;&gt; And doesn't that sound like a command? &gt;&gt; Fetch me a water. &gt;&gt; Bring me a morsel of bread. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her and said, "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand." Now there's a portion now which she needs to progress through the next portion which is blood which is typing the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this woman must now go through sanctification. She must go to that portion of sacrificing what she has. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She must sacrifice what she has. And then she said as the Lord liveth. Now remember the cake is bread because what does he ask her for? He asked her for bread, &gt;&gt; right? So don't think now he said go to uh west what West bakery and buy cake. No, the cake they're talking about is bread. &gt;&gt; Because as the Lord liveth, I have not a cake bread, but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise. &gt;&gt; And behold, I am gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die. &gt;&gt; Well, with with with just justification alone, you are going to die. &gt;&gt; Amen. with that revelation of the word. They are dying. &gt;&gt; There is no life in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's all they're doing. They're gathering two sticks. They got the Hail Marys. &gt;&gt; They got their works. &gt;&gt; Amen. So right now she's in the phase of between Luther and Wesley. &gt;&gt; And she's gathering two sticks. She can go in and dress it for a son that we may eat it and die. Were they dead after Wesley? &gt;&gt; They needed some life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how the Isuza Street outpouring came out. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Elijah said unto her, now many people think that she went without a promise. &gt;&gt; Before she even goes to bed or before she even makes a decision to go and do this thing, there's a prophetic word spoken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He doesn't speak this after she brings the cake. &gt;&gt; He doesn't speak it after she bakes the bread. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To say now that you're obedient, your barrel won't run dry. No, the prophetic word is spoken first. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because the very next thing, remember she's still talking to him and saying, "I have I have a little bit of meal. I have a little bit of oil." Then he says, "Fear not. Go and do as thou has said. &gt;&gt; Go bake the cake." &gt;&gt; But make me there a little cake first. &gt;&gt; That is where the sacrifice is coming. &gt;&gt; Make room for the word. &gt;&gt; Pay attention to what the prophet has commanded. &gt;&gt; I ask you to bring me a cake first. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring it unto me and after make for thee and thy son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch. He doesn't stop there. Now, &gt;&gt; he's going to give the prophetic word. &gt;&gt; Amen. For thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel. &gt;&gt; The barrel of meal shall not waste. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither shall the truths of oil fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until the day of the Lord send it rain upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So look at the prophecies that our prophet has prophesied over us. &gt;&gt; This will be a super church, &gt;&gt; a super race, an invincible army. &gt;&gt; A prophetic word given to the church before she was even super. &gt;&gt; Before she's even a super race, a super church, an invincible army, a word is spoken over her. Now she needs to go forth and fulfill her creation of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So she's now going under a thus say the Lord commission. And she as she's baking the cake, what do you think? Her heart is rejoicing. &gt;&gt; I've got a prophet here who just told me if I bake this cake, if I sacrifice right now. Amen. Hallelujah. The barrel will not run dry. The pool of oil will not run dry. So follow the prophet's word, we are under a prophetic gift, under a prophetic anointing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Every day that we live, every step that we make, we under a prophetic anointing. We are following the prophet of the age. every word that he prophesied over us. Amen. He has prophesied. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That in this time of famine, we shall be sustained. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then see, watch now verse 15. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah. And she and he and the house did eat many days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad it came out this way. &gt;&gt; He didn't wait for the cake first to prophesy. &gt;&gt; He prophesied first. &gt;&gt; That's our God. I know that's my God of Abraham because he told Abraham, "Get thee out of thy country." &gt;&gt; Before even before he got out of his country, he said, "Get thee out of thy country. I shall make thee a great nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God always give a promise first. &gt;&gt; You always give the word first. But people don't want to follow the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; Now, didn't we have a prophet who was prophesying since 1933, &gt;&gt; seven major visions. &gt;&gt; He prophesied through the church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then as the prophecy was getting greater and revelation was coming greater, he was prophesying greater things over this portion of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, &gt;&gt; even before it happened. &gt;&gt; And she did according to the saying of Elijah, she and he and a house did eat many days. What was that? The sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So she had come through sanctification now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the proofs of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So reconsider how we approach the prophet's word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The prophet's message. &gt;&gt; It's the word of the Lord which he spake via William Brandham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So which means that remember this woman had a portion of meal &gt;&gt; which is typing now the she made a bread &gt;&gt; but her bread was not a living bread. &gt;&gt; She needed to connect with the prophet's message in order for her bread to become a living bread that would sustain her through the famine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; So which means Luther's message won't work. &gt;&gt; Wesley's message won't work. restoration of the gifts alone won't work. &gt;&gt; You've got to connect with the prophetic message &gt;&gt; in order for your whatever you have, your word, your portion of the word, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; to become a living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, it doesn't stop there because we said there's water, there's blood, but there must come forth spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says that uh mechanics alone is not good enough. &gt;&gt; The word alone in his revelation form is not good enough. He says there must come dynamics upon the mechanics. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost coming to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, we've been feeding on the word, but we need quickening power now. &gt;&gt; And he says the dynamics of this church is a refilling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord. So this woman is sitting at a state now where she has listened to the prophet's message. &gt;&gt; She has obeyed the prophet's message. She's witnessing the supernatural. &gt;&gt; The flour is not running out. The oil is not running out. She's able to sustain herself in the time of famine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But remember, through her first marriage, she has reproduced life. Yes, &gt;&gt; she's got a son. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, and let's go to verse 18. Okay. 17. And it came to pass after these things, after the supernatural, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick, and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him. No spirit. &gt;&gt; What leaves it when you die? &gt;&gt; Spirit. &gt;&gt; What are we looking for? The third portion of the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. We We have We showed you water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We showed you blood sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Now spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What have I to do with thee, oh man of God? Art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son? &gt;&gt; Now remember what we have said that Elijah the prophet is typing son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is a son of man revealing the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So now the boy dies spirit leaves him. &gt;&gt; The spirit left the church. &gt;&gt; But there must come forth life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he cried unto and said, "Oh," he said unto her, "Give me thy son." And he took him out of her bosom and carried him into a loft where he abodeed and laid him on his own bed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get into the presence of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to his voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. Never stop listening to the tapes. &gt;&gt; Never stop listen reading the books. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He took him into his environment. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He took him out of the arms of the woman. He took him out of the arms of the widow. Remember again, this is the life the the life of the woman reproduced. But this life can't be sustaining &gt;&gt; because this is the life from the Oh, I hope somebody gets what how the Lord is bringing it to me. &gt;&gt; The life of the woman's the the woman's first husband can't sustain itself in the presence of God &gt;&gt; in this portion of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the you must die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this boy is going to have a new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The boy is dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he's going to have a new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But how is the new birth coming? Through a prophetic ministry &gt;&gt; through Christ himself veiled in a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Life is coming to the church. The prophet says denominational rumors had him bound. Had the Holy Ghost bound for 2,000 years. But the evening messenger loose the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we got the and and and I don't know if you know the spirit of Elijah works five times. &gt;&gt; This is the original Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So all types of shadows he will lay down there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; So all the religious leaders of the world remember they had 400 prophets and all of these things. They couldn't deliver the boy. The boy died. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because his life was wrong. &gt;&gt; He was from the life of the first husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now that she had met the word, &gt;&gt; now she had connected with the word, &gt;&gt; the evidence of this boy that she had reproduced, the life that she had reproduced must die. &gt;&gt; You can't bring your denominational husband's son into the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your denominational son's ideas into the message. It won't mix. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have many people who have left denominations, but they bring the denominational ideas into the message of the hour. But under the message of the hour, that spirit must die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the prophet takes ownership of the son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He takes him. Now, what does he have? A dead son. &gt;&gt; Now remember, the son is typing the image that the woman reproduced. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. took him out of her bosom, carried him into the loft where a boat and laid him on his own bed and he cried unto the Lord and said, "Oh Lord my God, hast thou brought evil upon the widow whom with whom I sold by slaying a son?" Now watch what he does. He is son of man. &gt;&gt; And the boy must come into the image of son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Son of man doesn't end with the prophet. &gt;&gt; We ready the quote in proving his word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the bride now under a messenger becomes the final voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he stretched himself upon the child three times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And cried unto the Lord. Oh Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You'll find Elisha who is a type of Elijah with a double portion. When he's here with this dead boy, he places nose upon nose, eyes upon eyes. &gt;&gt; Where is he getting it? From this Elijah. &gt;&gt; He's stretching himself over the boy. Why? He's trying to make that boy come into his image and likeness. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Let the child's soul come into him again." The boy is dead. He needs to be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he's going to have a new birth now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Life come back to the boy. Life come back to the church. when this evening time messenger came and sounded the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't know what hit the church. They call him Amen. The They call him the the one who spearheaded the healing revival. But life had come back into the church. &gt;&gt; They had thought that days of miracles are gone and passed away. &gt;&gt; But life came back to the church &gt;&gt; in its infancy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then 1963. Amen. The giver of life himself was coming down to the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; he says, amen. That the the the no more just the gifts of the Holy Ghost, but the giver, the life of the life himself came down upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To connect with the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived. He came back to life. He had a new birth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him to his mother. And Elijah said, "See, thy son live." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bright tree was fully restored. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What the canker, the palmer, the caterpillar, and the locust had eaten. Amen. But I will restore, say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not by power &gt;&gt; and not by might but by my &gt;&gt; spirit. There's your water, blood, and spirit. Say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, it's only when you have a new birth. It's only when now at the end time message that when you see the sun risen again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please get this last verse. When you see the image of Christ on display again, &gt;&gt; watch what she says. &gt;&gt; Because the image is back on the earth, because the image is resurrected, I'm talking about you coming into the image and likeness of Christ. I'm talking about you being adopted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you being just like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. She says, "Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, &gt;&gt; and that the word of the Lord is in thy mouth is truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is the evidence of the prophet's message? &gt;&gt; When we become the word made flesh, &gt;&gt; when we see the life of Christ on display, by this I know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not by the miracle, signs, and wonders. She didn't say this when she saw the the meal. when she saw the flower reproduced, when she saw the oil reproduced, &gt;&gt; but when she saw the life resurrected, when she saw the spirit come back upon the boy, when she saw the life of Christ back on display, &gt;&gt; she said, "By this I know that thou art a man of God." &gt;&gt; So all that the prophet prophesied over us, when we start to see ourselves looking in the mirror now and they say, "Mama, that's me. I see myself. I'm becoming the word made flesh. By this I know." &gt;&gt; Amen. that everything the prophet of God spoke about, they want to see signs and wonders and miracles. Amen. But me becoming the word made flesh is giving life to the prophet's message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How is the word being made flesh? In secret, &gt;&gt; in your home, &gt;&gt; here in the church, the word of God is being preached into you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Little by little, you're being formed into the word image. You are coming just like Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And by this, by this I know that thou art a man of God. &gt;&gt; By this is the vindication of the prophet's message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When his life is resurrected in you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you're looking to ever bring evidence of the prophet's message, &gt;&gt; look for the life of Christ to be on display in your life. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't try and go and say, "Look what the prophet did here. Look what the prophet did there. She is a mighty." That's not the evidence. &gt;&gt; What is the woman saying the evidence is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By this the resurrection of the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Christ is formed in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the Apostle Paul says, "I travail. &gt;&gt; I travail." &gt;&gt; Yes. The five-fold ministry is in true veil until Christ be formed indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it just blesses our heart to see it in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To see this. Amen. How God typed it here in the Bible &gt;&gt; with the first Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Now when I was telling you about about Elijah and and the Lord saying through this through him I've commanded a blessing upon I've commanded the widow. It's the same thing like in Exodus when the Lord says I am come down. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you go to Exodus 3, you'll pick it up there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. If you go to Exodus chapter 3, you'll see there from verse 7. Amen. He says, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by the reason of their task masters, for I know their sorrows." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land. So I am going to do this. Yes. &gt;&gt; But if you drop down there to verse 10, you'll see how the Lord is going to do it. Come now, therefore, I will send thee. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I will send thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's God veiled in Moses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, it's the same principle. It's the same God who is now saying, I have commanded the widow woman. &gt;&gt; How is he going to command it? Through Elijah. &gt;&gt; You've read it so many times, but you've never seen it. as Elijah commanding the woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God through Elijah is commanding the woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What was happening here? The prophet says when two omnipotentans meet, two omnipotent were meeting, Elijah and the widow woman, &gt;&gt; two omnipotent, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; connecting. When you connect with the prophetic message, two omnipotence are meeting. Amen. Let's go to the last quote there, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, birth pains. Okay, let's just skip that one. Let's go to the one above that. I'll just close with this one. Amen. Praise the Lord. The Lutheran spoke for God at that time. So that was the water that she had. She was willing to give him the water. &gt;&gt; But they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and and not the simple word. They could no longer speak for God. Then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day. &gt;&gt; The people who took his revelation from God. Now apply this to your own life now because you taking the revelation from William Brham, right? It's coming from God. The people who took his revelation from God became the living epistles whether known of all men for their generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you, are you the living epistol? &gt;&gt; Rather known of all men for your generation. &gt;&gt; Every generation had a chance at the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we must become the living epistles &gt;&gt; for our generation. &gt;&gt; Let's follow the thought now. When the Methodists failed, God raised up others. And so has it gone on through the years until in this last day. There is again another people in the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who under their messenger &gt;&gt; will be the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you have followed the thought who was speaking through Elijah &gt;&gt; who was speaking through Elijah &gt;&gt; God. Don't be afraid to say who are speaking through Elijah. &gt;&gt; God who are speaking through Moses. &gt;&gt; God. So to be the final voice to the final age who is speaking through the bride. &gt;&gt; Come on now. I can take you to Ati's birthday. God spoke through her heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the people think we are ordinary people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we who have come through justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost and are now all the way in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We speak for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the final voice to the final age. Let's go to the next slide there. You'll see what he's saying here. Yes, sir. The church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It's its own mouthpiece. So God is turning on her. He will confound her the church through the prophet and the bride for the voice of who will be in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So why are we so &gt;&gt; so upset when other people are saying things about us? &gt;&gt; When we are carrying the voice of God &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; the voice of God will be Does it sound like prophecy? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Let's be honest. &gt;&gt; Does this sound like prophecy? Amen. &gt;&gt; The voice of God will be enough. &gt;&gt; Does it sound like, "Okay, go and do what you want to do. Bake me the cake first, but thus sayith the Lord, the barrel shall not run dry." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nor the fruit of oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The voice of God will be in her. This is thus sayith the Lord. And if it was thus said the Lord then when there was no bride, I say the bride is now standing in full formation. And the voice of God is in the bride. &gt;&gt; She is the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's continue. Yes, it is. For it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 7, the spirit and the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then again, we were telling you it's not the spirit and the bride is two separate beings. The spirit is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit is not meant to float around like some ghost on the earth. &gt;&gt; The spirit was sent on the day of Pentecost to tabernacle men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; So when the scripture is saying the spirit and the bride say come, it's not the spirit crying out here and the bride is disconnected crying out here. The spirit is in the bride. &gt;&gt; In that day you shall know as I was in the father, the father in me, I in you, you in me. The spirit is now tabernacled in this many membered body and they are crying out come [Music] &gt;&gt; once more. The world will hear direct from God. Now watch, if it's two separate, spirit and bride, but they're going to hear once more direct from God. Who are they going to hear from? The spirit of the bride, &gt;&gt; they're going to hear from one being. &gt;&gt; Because that's exactly what the second mystery purpose is. God &gt;&gt; expressing himself through his people. &gt;&gt; We are part of the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; When we reading Revelation 10:7 that this prophet will come and reveal the mystery of God, we are part of that mystery of God. God is now finally got an evil on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Every day the serpent is trying to tempt you, &gt;&gt; trying to deceive you, &gt;&gt; but you know what the prophet of God says? He sent you from heaven with a ring. &gt;&gt; We read it on Sunday. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; He sent you with the wedding band already from heaven. &gt;&gt; So that no one can flirt with you. They can see you spoken for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only that, he said he sent you predestinated &gt;&gt; with the CG. &gt;&gt; Amen. which means you're already pregnantated. &gt;&gt; You already have seed in you. &gt;&gt; That Satan can't put his seed in you. &gt;&gt; There's no seed of discrepancy can come into this bride because he sent you predestinated with your wedding ring and with your seed. &gt;&gt; He said this bride will not fall. He wasn't going to take a chance. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because Amen. He says Jehovah's bride fell. &gt;&gt; He said Jesus bride fell. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. through seven church ages they fell. But he said this bride at the end time, Amen. This bride that you and I are part of will not fall like he fell. &gt;&gt; Cuz God has already put his seed word in us. &gt;&gt; Once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost. So &gt;&gt; don't be afraid of your prophecy. Don't be afraid to speak &gt;&gt; because it is God speaking through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are hearing once more like what? Acts, we all marvel at Acts 2:38. Peter standing up there. He says they will hear once more like that. &gt;&gt; But they will not hear if we are silent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to go ahead with our prophecy. &gt;&gt; We've got to go ahead with what the Lord has commissioned us to do. Thou must prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're going to hear once more direct from God as at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; If you didn't get the whole message, how are they going to hear from God? God is veiled in you now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you are veiling God. You are veiling God. &gt;&gt; If we can only come to that realization, we will now have sacrifice. &gt;&gt; We will now surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how are they going to hear from God? They're going to hear from God. They will not hear from God unless you speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. He says once more the world the world &gt;&gt; will hear direct from God. &gt;&gt; Now if they are saying God is not speaking which means you are silent. &gt;&gt; Yes. True. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. Help us. &gt;&gt; Jesus is not coming back on the earth now to speak to them. &gt;&gt; He's saying once more they going to hear from God. &gt;&gt; Directly from God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How can you hear directly from God if he himself is not here? &gt;&gt; Come on. This is a serious hour people. &gt;&gt; How can we hear directly from God if we if he himself is not here? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, can somebody just ponder on that thought? &gt;&gt; How can the world hear directly from God if he himself is not here? &gt;&gt; Then you got to ask yourself, where is he? And then you got to say, "He's in me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; He is in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is Christ in me. &gt;&gt; The hope &gt;&gt; of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, it's becoming serious now. &gt;&gt; It's coming a serious hour when the responsibility is coming upon us. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you where we are failing. We are failing in sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We are failing in surrender. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We can't surrender. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. We we exalting the flesh too much. &gt;&gt; But we need to crucify the flesh. &gt;&gt; We need to surrender our lives. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we need to sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Spend time in his presence and say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; kill the son of the first husband." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Until it's no longer I that live, this boy must die. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; This widow's boy must die. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the prophet must come overshadow us &gt;&gt; and Christ be formed in me. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to say that this evening? &gt;&gt; Let's stand together and worship him. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we worship him. We give him praise. We give him glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, how powerful it is there typed in the first Elijah. &gt;&gt; And now we in the fourth Elijah's ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then it must reproduce itself. &gt;&gt; Son of man as must lay now. We must lay. That's why he says we must lay in the presence of the sunlight to ripen come into the image and likeness of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just talk to the Lord. Father, I pray Lord that you Lord, you heard what we said tonight. Oh God, I ask you to forgive me, to wash me, to cleanse me, to purify me, oh God. Lord, if I haven't allowed this full word to have its full effect upon my life, oh God, Father, I repent even now, oh God, and I say, Lord, help me to sacrifice more.

Oh, but just Lord, oh father, being a sacrificial lamb and being more like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, though they slap me, I'll turn my other sheep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No matter what men may do to me, &gt;&gt; oh father, like a lamb, &gt;&gt; I'm coming into your image and likeness, oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I give you glory. I give you praise. I give you honor, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, I pray, Lord, that your name will be glorified, oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord, hear the cry of your people, Father. &gt;&gt; I pray, Lord, don't meet us at the point of our need, oh God.

Amen. &gt;&gt; God spoke out of the prophet and spoke to the storm. God spoke out of the prophet and spoke squirrels into existence. What was it?

Father, even as your word has been opened up to us and revealed to us in this time and season who we are, oh God, &gt;&gt; Lord, if you were here in the flesh, but the Lord would come to Jesus and say, &gt;&gt; "Amen. &gt;&gt; I have need of thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Lord, even as we have just heard tonight, that is God in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I bring my dear brother before you, Lord.

Oh God, he's always stayed faithful to your word. Oh God, always stood up for the truth. Oh God, and that's a revelation, oh God, that you quicken that CG within him, oh God.
