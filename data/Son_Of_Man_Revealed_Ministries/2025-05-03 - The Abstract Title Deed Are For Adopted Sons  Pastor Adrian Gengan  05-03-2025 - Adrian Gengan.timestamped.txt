[2:18] anybody Genesis chapter 1 we'll read
[2:21] from verse
[2:24] 28 and God blessed them
[2:32] and God said unto them be fruitful and
[2:36] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[2:39] subdue
[2:40] it and have dominion over the fish of
[2:43] the sea and over the F of the air and
[2:46] over every living thing that moveth upon
[2:48] the Earth God said behold I have given
[2:50] you every herb bearing seed which is
[2:53] upon the face of all the Earth of every
[2:55] tree in the which is the fruit of a tree
[2:59] healing SE seed to you it shall be for
[3:02] meat and to every beast of the earth and
[3:05] to every foul of the air and to
[3:07] everything that creepeth upon the Earth
[3:10] wherein there is life I have given every
[3:13] green herb for meat and it was
[3:16] so amen let's also turn Amen to the book
[3:19] of
[3:23] Acts Acts chapter 2
[3:36] amen praise the
[3:42] Lord Acts chapter 2 we'll read
[3:47] from verse
[3:49] 38 then Peter said unto them
[3:53] repent now remember there are some
[3:55] action words here amen repent is an
[3:58] action word baptize is an action word
[4:01] amen then Peter said unto them repent
[4:04] and be baptized every one of you in the
[4:06] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[4:09] of sins so once that is done there's a
[4:12] promise attached and you shall receive
[4:14] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[4:17] promise is unto you now this is a
[4:19] promise how does God measure
[4:21] faithfulness by what we have done with
[4:23] promise for the promise is unto you and
[4:25] to your children and to all that are far
[4:28] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[4:31] shall call amen one more portion of
[4:33] scripture so that there is a promise
[4:35] that's an inheritance given to us
[4:37] Genesis chapter
[4:39] 13 after his separation from unbelief
[4:42] we'll read amen about Abraham we know we
[4:46] are Seed of Abraham children of Abraham
[4:50] After the Promise so Genesis chapter 13
[4:53] and verse 14 says now remember he's now
[4:57] separated from lot lot lot is typing the
[5:00] world and the Lord said unto Abraham
[5:02] after that lot was separated from him
[5:06] amen lift up now thine eyes and look
[5:09] from the place where thou art so the
[5:12] place where we are standing positionally
[5:14] now in 2025 let's look from there
[5:19] amen northward Southward Eastward and
[5:23] Westward so God is asking us to look in
[5:26] all directions amen amen because we are
[5:28] to possess all all things so he's
[5:30] telling him to look but let's see why is
[5:32] he telling him to
[5:34] look amen for all the land which thou
[5:37] see to thee will I give it amen and to
[5:41] thy seed forever and I will make thy
[5:45] seed as the dust of the earth so that if
[5:47] a man can number the dust of the earth
[5:49] then shall thy seed also be numbered
[5:52] arise and walk through the land now
[5:54] while we are reading this I want you to
[5:55] understand the land is the Holy
[5:58] Ghost so so when he's saying I'm giving
[6:00] you the land I I want you to look
[6:02] northward of the Holy Ghost Eastward
[6:04] Westward and Southward don't be one
[6:06] dimensional of the Holy Ghost we need to
[6:08] get into all dimensions of the Holy
[6:10] Ghost amen praise the Lord walk through
[6:13] the land the length of it the breadth of
[6:15] it for I will give it unto you don't
[6:17] just stop at speaking in tongues yes but
[6:19] move
[6:20] on Amen Hallelujah the Lord had
[6:23] blessings to the reading of his word you
[6:24] may be
[6:28] seated amen
[6:31] trust everyone is well amen hallelujah
[6:35] amen when we come into the house of the
[6:36] Lord remember uh we we're not back in
[6:40] the Ford mot days of the early days
[6:43] where they had this crank thing in the
[6:46] front of the car where we have to warm
[6:48] our engines you remember back in the day
[6:51] amen you had to sit in your car a little
[6:52] while and hidle the car now people don't
[6:55] do that anymore praise the Lord amen so
[6:58] I pray uh I am actually speaking about
[7:01] you I pray we don't have to warm engines
[7:03] amen amen but that uh each service is a
[7:06] continuity amen so we are speaking about
[7:09] the abstract titled deed which are for
[7:10] adopted Sons amen
[7:14] hallelujah now we know that God is
[7:16] giving something to
[7:18] Adam right and what he is giving him is
[7:21] an
[7:23] inheritance Adam can't say that he
[7:26] worked for what he received yes
[7:30] God is working through six days of
[7:34] creation what is an inheritance an
[7:37] inheritance is given to you
[7:40] am is everyone paying attention we the
[7:43] things that we work for is not our
[7:45] inheritance we worked for it and
[7:48] inheritance is somebody else gave it to
[7:50] you so God is working through six days
[7:53] of
[7:54] creation and then we read in Genesis 1
[7:57] from verse 28 he's now saying all all
[7:59] this I have created here on the earth I
[8:01] am giving it to you so inheritance is
[8:04] given for continuity that's right all
[8:08] that God worked to achieve he now
[8:11] placing it in the hand of his son and he
[8:13] wants
[8:16] continuity
[8:17] Hallelujah all of a man's labor all that
[8:20] he works for on the earth is for
[8:21] continuity he builds it up so that the
[8:24] Next
[8:24] Generation can live off the fruit of his
[8:27] labors amen amen amen
[8:33] hallelujah and The Inheritance is not
[8:35] meant to be
[8:38] Grievous The Inheritance is not made to
[8:41] make your life difficult The Inheritance
[8:43] is meant to be a
[8:45] blessing hallelujah amen so the one that
[8:49] is going to receive it is going to be
[8:50] blessed by The
[8:52] Inheritance
[8:53] amen and the one who is going to receive
[8:56] it is remember he has to live in The
[8:58] Inheritance
[9:00] yes so so what we are saying is God is
[9:02] measuring faithfulness now because when
[9:06] when the Lord comes in Matthew 25 and
[9:08] he's you have to give an account for
[9:10] what he's given to you and you don't
[9:12] give him in return he's giving you
[9:14] Revelation and you don't give him the
[9:16] manifestation back he's going to hold us
[9:19] accountable amen so to one he gave
[9:23] talents and the one gave him back he
[9:25] said Lord I've ascended all dimensions
[9:27] of the Holy Ghost yes and he said well
[9:30] done my good and faithful
[9:32] servant now remember why I'm saying that
[9:35] God measures faithfulness by what we
[9:37] have done with the promise so this man
[9:39] handled the promise well so God tells
[9:41] him well done my good and faithful
[9:44] servant so what we have done with what
[9:46] God has given us is how God will measure
[9:49] it back so if we give him that's
[9:52] anything in the gospel now remember we
[9:53] said God's kingdom works by
[9:56] multiplication God's kingdom works by
[9:58] addition yes
[10:02] amen so to inherit anything is not a
[10:07] right to inherit something is a
[10:09] privilege just because we're born into a
[10:12] household doesn't mean we have a right
[10:14] to The
[10:15] Inheritance it is the one the test is he
[10:17] called the testator the one that's given
[10:20] that owns it is it the testator the one
[10:22] that owns everything has a right who he
[10:25] wants to distribute his inheritance to
[10:29] so just because we bear the family name
[10:32] just because we're born in the house
[10:34] doesn't give us a right to The
[10:37] Inheritance
[10:39] hallelujah amen so we must realize that
[10:42] what's been given to us is a
[10:46] privilege hallelujah it's a privilege
[10:49] and something that somebody else toil
[10:52] for it somebody else labored for
[10:56] it price has been paid amen stripping
[11:00] with blood yes dripping with blood the
[11:04] Holy Ghost
[11:06] Gospel stripping with
[11:09] blood so there's a price that was paid
[11:12] yes amen the word that we have the
[11:15] Comfort we have of having the entire
[11:18] book open to us came with a price yes
[11:23] amen think of if you're reading there in
[11:26] Hebrews chapter 11 how they were
[11:28] slaughtered how they were slain how they
[11:30] wandered about in desert in sheep skin
[11:33] and in goat skin and how the gospel
[11:34] progressed yes amen then we come to the
[11:37] New Testament after this promise where
[11:40] the Holy Ghost is poured out that's the
[11:41] land that's being poured out to us now
[11:43] comes Satan with his R and he's trying
[11:46] to take away the word from the people
[11:49] and they gave up their lives yes and now
[11:51] the gospel amen slowly got
[11:54] diluted so I'm saying what we have is an
[11:57] inheritance when brother br came because
[12:00] his ministry was to release the title
[12:06] deed amen so what they toiled for what
[12:09] they labored for think of brother Bram
[12:11] how he
[12:12] struggled Amen in the early years going
[12:16] out into the field of evangelism the
[12:19] time time and season wasn't right yet so
[12:22] he's told do the work of an evangelist
[12:24] so he goes around with an healing
[12:26] Revival yes amen with the first and
[12:28] second pool with the bait Hallelujah
[12:32] trying to get them to come now so they
[12:33] can hear the word of God but at the
[12:35] third pool they all shut their doors he
[12:38] says when I'm preaching the seals he
[12:40] says I'll lose many of my friends yes so
[12:43] the sacrifice and all that he toiled and
[12:45] labored for Amen to get now leave his
[12:48] hometown leave his church and go there
[12:50] Into the Wilderness to receive the
[12:52] revelation of the Seven Seals amen it
[12:56] was a sacrifice it was a labor
[12:59] amen so if we are put on the will if we
[13:03] are put our names are put there it's a
[13:06] privilege amen hallelujah it's an honor
[13:10] yes because the one that is leaving me
[13:12] something they love
[13:17] me brother Bram had a love for the
[13:19] people of
[13:21] God
[13:23] Amen he toiled and he labored because he
[13:26] knew that God was using him to sew a
[13:27] seed so that there would be an Harvest
[13:30] now think of this great God who Who
[13:32] Loved Adam and he all that he created
[13:35] there in Genesis 1 he now gives him as
[13:37] an
[13:39] inheritance and when God gives an
[13:41] inheritance he's expecting
[13:44] multiplication amen didn't we just read
[13:47] that there in Genesis chapter 1 yes
[13:50] multiply yes amen God's first
[13:53] instruction to man is to multiply yes
[13:57] and
[13:59] amen he says multiply and replenish yes
[14:03] so inheritance is for
[14:06] multiplication yes and to be replenished
[14:10] yes Hallelujah so I'm asking again what
[14:13] are we doing with the promised word is
[14:15] it bringing forth
[14:17] multiplication when God is giving us
[14:19] something when God is putting something
[14:21] into our hands when we are are good
[14:23] stewards of the word when we are good
[14:25] stewards of finances God can multiply it
[14:28] yes but what we find is sometimes when
[14:31] it comes into our hand there's
[14:32] subtraction happening there's division
[14:34] happening because we are not operating
[14:36] under Kingdom law and principles we're
[14:38] operating under Satan's law which is
[14:40] subtraction and division yes hallelujah
[14:44] amen amen the Apostle is telling us that
[14:48] in stewards they must be accounted to be
[14:51] faithful stewards amen hallelujah amen
[14:55] so we find here that something was lost
[14:57] in the Garden of Eden we don't have time
[14:59] to go through the entire story it's a
[15:00] Wednesday night but you know that Adam
[15:03] was given eternal life yes Adam was
[15:06] given power over the
[15:08] Earth Adam had fellowship with God and
[15:11] he lost these three
[15:13] things he lost this
[15:15] inheritance the Holy Ghost left Adam yes
[15:19] in the Garden of Eden amen that was his
[15:22] rightful
[15:23] inheritance God in man right God in his
[15:27] people is a super amen amen so the Holy
[15:31] Ghost left Adam yes his inheritance
[15:35] praise the Lord and you know that there
[15:37] was a cherub put around the tree so that
[15:39] to guard the way back to the tree of
[15:41] life and and and brother Bram says that
[15:43] the tital deed now went back to the
[15:45] original owner that's the scene you're
[15:47] finding now that when the kinsman
[15:49] redeemer comes if if you go to
[15:51] Revelation 5 that's the scene you are
[15:54] seeing there the original owner is
[15:56] sitting with the inheritance to the
[15:58] Earth
[16:00] amen but this title deed don't belong in
[16:03] the
[16:04] heavens this title deed was given to man
[16:07] on the earth if you read Genesis 1: 28
[16:11] and onwards we just read that you will
[16:13] see where the inheritance is given to
[16:15] man yes
[16:17] Hallelujah so that's what was lost
[16:19] eternal life fellowship with God and
[16:21] dominion over the Earth so these are the
[16:24] things we are regaining yes amen
[16:27] hallelujah amen this is what we are
[16:30] striving for when we are talking about
[16:32] John standing there in Revelation 10 8-1
[16:36] and the angel is asking to take this
[16:38] title deed back what he's asking him to
[16:41] do is to take back his rightful claims
[16:44] to the Earth is to take back dominion
[16:47] over the Earth amen hallelujah is to
[16:50] regain your fellowship with God
[16:54] amen
[16:56] amen and to have eternal life amen
[17:00] praise the
[17:01] Lord so we we knew that there was a
[17:05] price to pay now this book is sitting
[17:08] there but there's a price and only a man
[17:10] from the earth yes the book was lost by
[17:13] a man yes and only a man's
[17:16] blood can redeem us back to our original
[17:20] inheritance so the prophet says that
[17:22] Propet after
[17:24] Prophet amen it looked like they could
[17:26] be the one but in the
[17:29] weakness Hallelujah it exposed their
[17:33] sinful nature so God couldn't God could
[17:35] only use them in a measure they were
[17:37] revealing Christ it was Christ in Moses
[17:40] Christ in Noah Christ in David Christ in
[17:44] Joseph I if you heard the prophet saying
[17:46] this in part in part in part they could
[17:49] only reveal him in part because of the
[17:52] human
[17:53] nature so God needed a perfect Son of
[17:56] God God needed a man with pure blood yes
[18:01] God could couldn't use ibr man to redeem
[18:03] it yes it re quied amen a sinless one a
[18:07] spotless one Hallelujah so God took amen
[18:11] God created the cell and he found a
[18:15] woman was amen able now to comply with
[18:18] the Angel's message she was prophesied
[18:20] in the Bible to come and near in Time
[18:23] season she's now on the earth ready to
[18:25] receive the promise from the angel
[18:27] Gabriel the holy H Spirit shall
[18:29] overshadow you amen I say even tonight
[18:32] the Holy Spirit shall overshadow you you
[18:34] shall bear a son amen and his name Shall
[18:37] be Called Jesus amen when Jesus is
[18:40] reproducing himself all his sons must
[18:42] bear his same name so if his name is
[18:45] Jesus and you are Mrs Jesus Christ if
[18:47] you are going to conceive and bring
[18:48] forth a son you are bringing forth
[18:50] another
[18:52] Jesus amen amen when the devil sees you
[18:55] he's confused yes amen at one time he
[18:59] was only facing one
[19:01] Jesus but now he's surrounded by an army
[19:03] of Jesus
[19:05] hallelujah amen amen he's pouring out
[19:08] his Spirit that's what we read there
[19:11] amen Jesus Christ came now on the earth
[19:13] you know John 3:16 is born on the Earth
[19:16] Hallelujah the sin spotless one and the
[19:19] voice comes at the Jordan there amen
[19:21] when he's older now and says this is my
[19:23] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[19:27] now because Satan Hur heard
[19:30] that he followed into the desert to see
[19:33] if he really believed what he heard at
[19:35] the Jordan yes to see if you really
[19:38] believe you as a Son of God this message
[19:40] came to give you your true identity so
[19:42] Satan follows you every day in your life
[19:45] to check whether you truly believe you
[19:46] are the Son of
[19:48] God yes amen whether you really believe
[19:51] that
[19:52] voice amen but this bride is not a
[19:55] denominational seed Hallelujah so she
[19:57] don't fall amen by Satan's schemes and
[20:00] she goes back to the word to say it is
[20:02] written it is written of me look at how
[20:05] many scriptures we read and it pertains
[20:07] to us it is written this is my
[20:09] inheritance it is written this is my
[20:11] promise it is written that I am here
[20:13] positioned on the earth now to take back
[20:15] my title
[20:17] deed so Satan has to flee amen praise
[20:21] the Lord amen amen so when Jesus he died
[20:26] and he he was buried we know he went to
[20:29] the fourth dimension and he took back
[20:32] the keys to death hell and the
[20:36] grave amen he defeated Satan because he
[20:39] was the one found worthy he's now
[20:42] sacrificing himself and his blood will
[20:45] now make an atonement for all of
[20:48] mankind but he's really after Adam's
[20:52] seed the names that were in the book am
[20:55] cuz Jesus said all that the father has
[20:57] given me will come to me and not one of
[20:59] them will be lost so he's after those
[21:02] names but his blood is enough to save
[21:04] the entire
[21:05] world yes sir amen his blood is enough
[21:10] powerful enough strong enough and
[21:12] brother brandom is saying that the blood
[21:14] of Jesus Christ is just as powerful
[21:16] today as if it was shed 10 minutes
[21:21] ago amen so the blood of Jesus still
[21:23] makes atonement for us hallelujah it
[21:25] still washes white as snow it's still
[21:28] cleanses amen amen oh precious is the
[21:32] flow that makes me white as
[21:35] snow amen nothing but the blood of
[21:39] Jesus so when we lost this now Jesus
[21:42] Christ now ascends now this is where
[21:44] denomination stop at the Ascension of
[21:48] Jesus he goes to heaven they don't know
[21:51] where he is Somewhere in Heaven and the
[21:54] Holy Ghost being poured out and their
[21:57] version of the Holy Ghost being poured
[21:58] out is speaking in tongues that's where
[22:00] they stop they have put a full
[22:04] stop the Holy Ghost being poured out he
[22:06] speaking in tongues right they believe
[22:08] in Mark 16 but Mark 16 is before Acts
[22:11] chapter 2 so they believe in Mark 16
[22:14] because they want physical
[22:16] manifestations amen hallelujah but
[22:19] remember what they are producing is an
[22:21] impersonation of Christianity am so they
[22:25] stop at Acts chapter 2
[22:28] where they spoke in unknown
[22:31] tongues and they know nothing about
[22:33] Jesus go now the Redeemer now must go to
[22:37] the one who's got the
[22:38] book Revelation chapter
[22:41] 5 and there's only one class of people
[22:43] called to Revelation 5 yes the class
[22:47] that's found in Revelation 4 was called
[22:50] up higher which is John
[22:53] yes amen now everyone knows that in
[22:56] Revelation 4:1 he says I Heard a Voice
[22:59] as a trumpet talking to me saying come
[23:01] up higher right now brother Bram says
[23:05] that's the Rapture everyone
[23:06] agree now we know if that is the rapture
[23:09] brother Brandon is saying Rapture
[23:11] happens in shout voice and Trump so John
[23:13] is caught up where is he caught up in
[23:15] the shout is he caught up in The Voice
[23:17] or is he caught up in the
[23:18] Trump for John to receive that
[23:21] Revelation he's caught up in the
[23:23] shout hallelujah everyone
[23:26] agrees if that is the rapture is's
[23:28] caught up in the shout yes and it's in
[23:30] the shout that the seals are
[23:34] revealed so brother Braham says that
[23:37] this I don't have time to read it you
[23:38] can read it in the breach message he
[23:40] says when when Jesus Christ now ascends
[23:43] to Heaven is the is playing the
[23:45] intercessory role he's now the high
[23:48] priest who makes intercession for seven
[23:51] Church ages Hallelujah you know the high
[23:54] priest went to the temple yes so he's
[23:57] making intercession for seven Church
[24:00] ages and when John gets to Heaven it's
[24:03] about the time of the end of the seven
[24:05] Church ages but he not out of the
[24:07] sanctuary yet that's why they can't find
[24:10] Jesus yes only the high priest could
[24:12] enter the holiest of
[24:15] holies amen so when they look through
[24:18] all of Heaven they look on the earth
[24:20] they look beneath the Earth they can't
[24:22] find one worthy but we know Jesus was
[24:26] worthy but they could not find him
[24:28] because no one could go into the holiest
[24:30] of holies they had to wait for the
[24:32] priest to come back out again amen yes
[24:35] amen so when his time of intercession is
[24:38] over he's coming back out of the
[24:40] sanctuary and now that strong
[24:42] angel that cherub with a flaming sword
[24:46] the one that was guarding the way back
[24:47] to the tree of life he saying who is
[24:49] worthy to take the
[24:53] book and now John starts to weep because
[24:55] no one was worthy but then Jesus coming
[24:57] back out of the Sanctuary they said
[24:59] Johan don't
[25:01] weep because the lion has
[25:04] prevailed praise the Lord yes now they
[25:08] see a lion but right there he changes
[25:11] his mask amen and when John turns to
[25:14] look he sees the one with a chang mask
[25:16] amen
[25:18] amen and he
[25:20] says amen he saw the lamb he says I
[25:24] turned to look and I saw a lamb as
[25:26] though it had been slain amen bleeding
[25:29] bloody yes blood still making atonement
[25:33] amen
[25:36] hallelujah now the I'm giving you a very
[25:39] amen I'm trying to break it down very
[25:41] briefly for you Jesus comes back out and
[25:43] he takes the title deed back brother
[25:46] brandom says that title deed now he
[25:48] sealed with Seven Seals amen so now you
[25:52] need somebody to break those seals amen
[25:55] so he's tying his ministry in with this
[25:58] to show a son of man revealing the son
[26:00] of man that God needs a prophet on the
[26:04] earth amen so the seals in heaven the
[26:07] seals in Revelation is broken in symbol
[26:11] form but the seals now in Revelation
[26:14] must be broken on the earth so that now
[26:17] come 63 when seven angels come down you
[26:19] know this picture was taken amen
[26:21] hallelujah seven angels come meet the
[26:23] prophet and they tell him amen you go
[26:25] back and preach the seals so what he's
[26:27] doing is unlocking the seals to the
[26:31] title deed of our Redemption now so
[26:34] everything that Adam lost is now being
[26:35] regained to us amen hallelujah amen now
[26:39] what is it what is an abstract title
[26:44] deed
[26:45] amen if I can Define it brother Bram
[26:48] says that an abstract title deed takes
[26:51] it all the way to the
[26:53] beginning so along the way it might have
[26:56] had other owners the deed
[27:00] amen let's take a car if you buy a
[27:04] secondhand car maybe you're the fourth
[27:06] owner maybe right now you have an
[27:09] original document with your name on it
[27:12] but on the eat system they can trace it
[27:15] back all different
[27:17] owners praise the Lord but he says what
[27:21] the abstract title did does it strikes
[27:23] off all the previous owners and it takes
[27:25] it back to its original condition
[27:28] praise the Lord so at one time when the
[27:31] word was being
[27:33] restored the Lutheran had claimed to the
[27:36] abstract yes they had one work of Grace
[27:39] yes the wans had another abstract yes
[27:44] sanctification the Pentecostals had
[27:46] another abstract so they they had the
[27:49] abstract being passed to them yes
[27:51] Hallelujah everyone's trying to get the
[27:53] point amen so they can make claims on
[27:56] the word yes but at the opening of that
[27:58] seven seal amen when the seals are now
[28:02] released and revealed to the bride it
[28:04] strikes off all other claims yes they
[28:06] can't make any claims to any part of the
[28:09] promise of God because now Jesus Christ
[28:12] himself comes to marry himself to a
[28:14] bride and he gives them full legal
[28:18] Authority thank you Lord
[28:21] amen so he strikes off every other claim
[28:24] to him and he calls them blasphemous
[28:28] names
[28:30] yes amen he says they are Blasphemous
[28:34] names oh Hallelujah these people put
[28:37] their names on their churches but he
[28:39] calls them Blasphemous
[28:41] names amen he doesn't recognize them he
[28:45] only recognizes those that are able to
[28:48] receive the word praise the Lord so all
[28:52] that we are losing eternal life
[28:54] fellowship with God and power over the
[28:56] Earth we are gaining back what for
[28:58] feated we are gaining
[29:01] back
[29:03] amen so we also know that Satan is
[29:06] called the God of this evil age amen but
[29:09] he is not our God hallelujah he's the
[29:12] God of this evil age amen he's the God
[29:15] of this
[29:16] world but we are not of this
[29:20] world Amen he's the God of this evil age
[29:23] but we are not part of the evil age we
[29:25] are called out into the bright age
[29:27] Hallelujah so Satan is not our God Satan
[29:30] may have control of
[29:33] governments but there is a resistance on
[29:35] the earth hallah he may control the
[29:38] whole Earth but there is a resistance on
[29:41] the earth do you know who forms a
[29:44] resistance an
[29:46] army an army is is forming a resistance
[29:50] remember he is governing the entire
[29:52] Earth he is controlling the entire Earth
[29:54] but there is a group of people on the
[29:56] Earth who he has no control over yes
[29:58] there's a group of people on the Earth
[30:00] who have formed a
[30:02] resistance the Bible says resist the
[30:04] devil and he will flee Hallelujah this
[30:06] is one Army he can't conquer yes this is
[30:09] one Army the Bible says he deceived the
[30:11] nations of the Earth but this is one
[30:13] people he can't deceive can you imagine
[30:16] all that he labored for amen he's being
[30:19] brought to North By God's
[30:21] Army all that he's pursuing on the Earth
[30:24] all that he's working to achieve on the
[30:26] earth one Army is defying him hallelujah
[30:31] praise the Lord thank you Lord well amen
[30:34] if you don't believe it that's why you
[30:35] won't say Amen the reason you won't say
[30:37] Amen is because you know you are
[30:39] stumbling every day you're not having
[30:41] the victory Hallelujah people can't have
[30:44] the victory in their lives why they
[30:46] still sin in their
[30:48] life amen there's still unbelief in
[30:50] their life so you find amen they start
[30:52] to
[30:54] crack amen start had a little pressure
[30:57] brother Rand says somebody's TOS
[30:59] you'll see if they're dead yes amen
[31:03] because he says the spirit of Christ is
[31:05] not one like that so we can't hide fruit
[31:09] yes brother Brandon says you can hide
[31:10] seed but you can't hide
[31:13] fruit he says by your fruits they are
[31:16] known so what we Proclaim God is not
[31:19] interested in what we are proclaiming
[31:21] I'm a message believer I'm a message
[31:23] believer show me amen yes sir how do you
[31:26] show me by the life that I live my
[31:29] everyday life thank you Lord yes amen
[31:32] everyday life how do I
[31:36] live praise the
[31:39] Lord are we cracking under
[31:43] pressure the slightest thing are we
[31:45] cracking pressure at work pressure at
[31:48] home pressure at
[31:50] school
[31:51] amen hallelujah because what's going to
[31:54] come out amen is going to reveal what's
[31:57] on the inside side am if we are finding
[32:00] flaw there's something wrong we need to
[32:03] check our experience brother brandom
[32:05] says now I wish we had the quotes here
[32:07] he says we need to check our prayer life
[32:10] you remember he says now when that when
[32:12] that conductor is coming now to check if
[32:14] that cut is packed properly what he says
[32:18] everything must be packed down tight he
[32:20] says there can't be anything loose there
[32:22] he says then he sees if we little loose
[32:24] about our prayer
[32:25] life if we loose about our Bible reading
[32:28] we little loose about our temper little
[32:31] loose about our patience little loose am
[32:35] he says then you can't seal the
[32:39] cart amen praise the Lord now watch what
[32:43] he said there loose about prayer life
[32:45] people think that's nothing loose about
[32:47] your Bible reading he says loose about
[32:49] your temper Ah that's nothing no God
[32:53] says it's something but the brand says
[32:54] he won't seal the cup
[32:59] praise the Lord now Satan has access to
[33:02] certain Realms of
[33:04] you because the flesh is not
[33:07] redeemed I don't if you think your flesh
[33:09] is
[33:12] redeemed this flesh is our bread
[33:16] yes Hallelujah that's why God is coming
[33:19] if you ever wondered why a body changed
[33:21] God has to change this body this was not
[33:24] our intended way to
[33:25] come so God has to change this body to
[33:29] fully redeem it that's why he says our
[33:32] full maturity is when we receive the
[33:34] body
[33:35] change thank you the full maturity yes
[33:39] amen because we need a new body if we
[33:41] are to operate like Adam we need a new
[33:43] body if we are to pass through walls you
[33:45] can't pass through walls with this body
[33:47] praise the
[33:49] Lord so Satan don't control this
[33:52] church Satan don't control Sons and
[33:54] Daughters of God Amen Hallelujah he may
[33:58] be the God of this world but I say even
[34:01] now even if you don't believe it even if
[34:02] you can't say amen I say you say an amen
[34:04] to itj he don't control this Army he
[34:07] don't control this child of
[34:09] God
[34:11] hallelujah and sometimes we can't be
[34:14] accommodating to the devil the prophet
[34:16] is saying if we receive an inheritance
[34:18] and we go there and we find people there
[34:21] occupying this house occupying our
[34:23] inheritance I say maybe there's occupant
[34:26] amongst your inheritance this night yes
[34:29] demon Power is coming to oppress you and
[34:31] you don't even know it amen demon power
[34:34] is whispering in your ears but you can't
[34:36] take every thought captive Under The
[34:38] Obedience of the Holy
[34:40] Ghost amen hallelujah amen amen he's The
[34:45] God Who has blinded the eyes of the
[34:48] world but he can't blind our eyes yes
[34:51] what are we what am I trying to tell you
[34:53] we are making Satan powerless that's
[34:56] right amen when see you he don't know
[34:58] what to do with
[35:00] you he don't know how to handle
[35:07] you I'm say it again when say I'm I'm
[35:11] I'm speaking to you and you ought to be
[35:13] conditioned when Satan sees you he don't
[35:15] know what to do with
[35:19] you the Bible says just one of us can
[35:22] put a thousand to flight two of us can
[35:25] send a legion flee
[35:27] hallelujah amen praise the
[35:31] Lord so he's the God of this Earth but
[35:34] he's not our
[35:35] God amen
[35:38] hallelujah our god is God Of Heaven and
[35:40] Earth Hallelujah he's just allowing them
[35:43] to run their cause for now because he's
[35:45] unfolding his Redemption plan praise the
[35:48] Lord so what we have got to do now if we
[35:50] find these people that have invaded Our
[35:52] Lives
[35:55] lies treachery
[35:58] amen
[36:00] unbelief cracks in our
[36:03] faith we've got to stand up and fight
[36:05] for what is ours
[36:08] am thank you
[36:10] Lord the Bible says we ought to be of he
[36:13] says the meek shall inherit the earth so
[36:16] we we don't fight he says can you
[36:18] imagine people struggling on the earth
[36:20] to buy a loaf of bread he says yet they
[36:23] own the entire thing Hallelujah he says
[36:26] they're struggling to pay their rent he
[36:27] says yet they own the entire
[36:29] thing he says Abraham was told he owns
[36:32] the entire thing but now he's struggling
[36:34] with cattl men he's struggling with lot
[36:37] he's struggling they're stealing his
[36:39] water they're fighting over water he
[36:42] says though he owns the whole thing yes
[36:45] yet it's a daily struggle he's living in
[36:47] a
[36:49] tent but he's heading towards the
[36:52] promise amen hallelujah so
[36:57] we've got to fight for our god-given
[36:59] rights amen we can't be pushed around by
[37:03] the devil
[37:05] yes
[37:06] amen demon powers coming to oppress us
[37:10] pushing us around pushing the sickness
[37:12] on us pushing this disease on us pushing
[37:15] this problem on us pushing this unbelief
[37:18] on us and we just accept it sometimes we
[37:21] don't even know but we are tools for the
[37:23] enemy
[37:28] why no discernment no spirit of
[37:31] discernment amongst us amen do you know
[37:35] that the Bible says that if you have
[37:37] done wrong against your brother he says
[37:39] you have to leave your
[37:41] gift make right with your brother and
[37:44] then present your gift amen but who does
[37:49] that that's why we talk about picking
[37:51] and choosing we pick and choose what we
[37:53] want so he's coming to push these things
[37:55] on us demon powers pushing amen we we
[37:59] we've got to now push back
[38:02] yes we've got to come to a point where
[38:04] enough is
[38:05] enough I will die to myself I will die
[38:09] to Pride do you know how hard that is
[38:13] that's why Jesus coming there now they
[38:15] think he's he's one coming now to rule
[38:16] on the earth and he's telling
[38:18] them turn the other
[38:24] cheek what we say today they will learn
[38:27] about the
[38:30] name
[38:35] amen where is turned the other
[38:38] cheek where is a man that I'd rather
[38:43] take the
[38:44] wrong I'd rather take the
[38:46] wrong to win my brother but we fight
[38:50] over doctrines divide don't even talk to
[38:52] one another over
[38:55] doctrines doctrines are probably don't
[38:57] even pertain to
[39:00] salvation but we
[39:03] fight you know the Bible talks about
[39:05] being angry Without a
[39:07] Cause praise the
[39:10] Lord so what he wants to do is
[39:12] negotiate Satan wants to negotiate
[39:15] regarding your
[39:16] inheritance I say that the the the the
[39:20] theme of the army of God this invincible
[39:24] Army is that there will be no
[39:26] negotiations yes
[39:28] we don't have hostage negotiators
[39:31] here Abraham was not willing to
[39:33] negotiate regarding his inheritance
[39:36] which was a lot Amen brother Bram says
[39:39] when everything was given to Abraham it
[39:41] included his property it included his
[39:44] relatives it included his cattle it
[39:47] included everything about his life come
[39:50] on I want you to get this everything
[39:52] about your life is included in your
[39:54] inheritance so when Satan is coming
[39:56] against any of those things you have the
[39:58] legal right to pursue and overtake it to
[40:03] regain it so what about your health it's
[40:06] a part of you it's a part of your
[40:08] inhabitance your lungs belong to you
[40:10] your heart Belong To You amen amen every
[40:13] fiber of your body Belongs to You Satan
[40:15] this is my inheritance you can't touch
[40:17] me am thank you Lord the thing is we are
[40:21] too accommodating for the
[40:24] devil because we're relying on science
[40:27] we are relying on Medical Aid instead of
[40:30] Miracle Aid we are relying on the things
[40:32] of this Earth instead of fixing our eyes
[40:34] Heavenly say I refuse to receive
[40:37] this sir amen hallelujah amen so when
[40:43] he's coming brother BR is saying he
[40:45] wants to negotiate you with you and tell
[40:47] you I'll tell you what we're going to do
[40:50] he says we ought to say you ain't going
[40:52] to do nothing am that's the way to talk
[40:55] back to him I know my position in Christ
[40:57] and you just might as well get away I
[40:59] ain't listening to you no more I got an
[41:06] inheritance sometimes the last thing we
[41:08] ever think about is the word of God when
[41:11] we have faced problem after problem
[41:13] challenge after challenge the word of
[41:15] God is the last thing on our mind
[41:16] because we are going into our flesh to
[41:18] think how we are going to solve
[41:20] something
[41:22] yes even if you don't have the scripture
[41:24] yet tell Satan I've got an inheritance
[41:27] in the word hallelujah let him know
[41:29] where your basis point is let him know
[41:31] where you standing on you are standing
[41:34] on the word you might find the scripture
[41:36] later but put him on notice right away
[41:39] Satan I have an
[41:41] inheritance I am not like any other age
[41:44] I am not like any other woman of the
[41:46] church I have the entire word open to me
[41:49] amen so in there I'm am going to find a
[41:51] weapon yes and I'm coming back to you
[41:54] I'm putting your notice now I have an in
[41:57] I've got the promised word I'm going
[41:59] into the word to find something that's
[42:01] going to blow you
[42:05] away but that's if we believe that the
[42:08] answer is in the word yes sir so when
[42:12] the Lord calls us now is's got to give
[42:13] us the abstract title deed so it's
[42:15] taking away every other
[42:18] claim praise the Lord and sometimes
[42:21] people are scared to use their rights
[42:24] what if it don't work no what ifs yes
[42:26] amen no what
[42:29] if when that man who son was uh falling
[42:34] into the fire and those disciples
[42:35] couldn't cast The Demon
[42:38] out he told Jesus if you are
[42:43] able if you are
[42:45] able Jesus said what do you mean if if
[42:49] you believe
[42:51] amen thank you Lord that's where Mark
[42:54] 9:23 comes in there he's trying to put
[42:58] if on Jesus Jesus says don't put a if on
[43:01] me I know my
[43:05] capabilities so he puts it back on him
[43:07] he says if you believe all things are
[43:10] possible to them that believe don't come
[43:12] to Jesus Oh only if if you will only do
[43:15] this
[43:16] no don't put it on Jesus as a if he is
[43:20] saying if you
[43:21] believe all things are
[43:23] possible amen so what we need to say God
[43:28] help us get our faith right because we
[43:30] can't be loing moving in low dimensions
[43:32] of
[43:34] Faith how long we going to walk around
[43:36] oh we have little faith yes we need to
[43:39] raise the standard of our faith we need
[43:41] to raise the level of our faith we also
[43:44] need to raise the level of our
[43:46] expectation you know if we don't expect
[43:48] anything good in this life we will
[43:49] receive nothing good in this life
[43:52] yes brother brand says you re you have
[43:56] not because you asked not
[43:58] am and he says we ask God with
[44:02] limitations praise the Lord
[44:04] yes so he says we got to get our faith
[44:07] in the right place in the right channel
[44:10] let's have high Ambitions to have high
[44:12] levels of
[44:14] faith not oh we have little faith but
[44:17] let's have high Ambitions to say that
[44:19] when Jesus looks at us and he's seeing
[44:21] our faith he says I have never seen such
