[1:45] pray Lord that you'll be with us now
[1:47] even as we further continue in Jesus
[1:49] name amen amen greetings in the most
[1:52] holy the most precious name of our Lord
[1:54] and Savior Jesus Christ hello somebody
[2:00] amen
[2:02] in the most holy the most precious name
[2:04] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[2:07] amen who is worthy to be praised amen
[2:10] greet your brother and sister amen say
[2:13] welcome into the house of the Lord amen
[2:15] amen amen hallelujah
[2:17] amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:21] glory be to his name
[2:25] amen
[2:26] it's always a tense time when you come
[2:28] into the pulpit
[2:29] amen
[2:31] and you watch how the spiritual start to
[2:33] manifest to die and distract the
[2:34] preacher now you don't be part of that
[2:36] Spirit that's going to distract the
[2:37] preacher right now because if you know
[2:39] anything ministers are temperamental
[2:41] people
[2:42] Elijah was a very temperamental man the
[2:45] prophet is amen because they're under
[2:47] the anointing and anything that triggers
[2:50] it they will Slaughter it there
[2:52] they don't care about your feelings
[2:55] if you need to be put in order they'll
[2:56] put you in order because the spirit of
[2:58] God is most important to us right now
[3:00] amen hallelujah we haven't come here in
[3:03] vain this is not a social club this is
[3:05] not something amen that we promote
[3:06] people to just come together amen but we
[3:09] are under the revealed word of the hour
[3:10] we come under the banner of the message
[3:12] of the hour amen amen amen praise the
[3:15] Lord he's worthy to be praised amen so
[3:18] amen let's turn to Mark chapter 9 verse
[3:21] 23 amen hallelujah Mark chapter 9 and
[3:24] verse 23 amen praise the Lord
[3:28] praise the Lord amen
[3:31] glory be to his name
[3:34] how many of you know it's the ninth
[3:36] month
[3:41] and what year is it
[3:46] now that which the Lord started at the
[3:48] beginning of the year
[3:51] nine months later
[3:54] whatever seed was sown in you
[3:57] if you haven't already received it
[4:00] let this be the month of your
[4:01] manifestation
[4:05] how many of you have received some of
[4:06] the visions and the things that you've
[4:08] asked the Lord for
[4:09] I mean if you're still waiting for some
[4:11] things to come to pass
[4:13] amen
[4:14] now in the natural if it takes nine
[4:16] months foresee that's sown into the
[4:19] right womb for it to develop and to be
[4:21] fully formed
[4:22] it must come forth
[4:25] we don't want any overtime babies
[4:28] neither do we want premature babies
[4:31] but that which the Lord had birthed
[4:33] within us and put within us
[4:35] it's time for the manifestation of it
[4:37] amen so Mark 9 and 23 says
[4:42] praise the Lord
[4:44] foreign
[4:46] to him
[4:48] if thou can't believe
[4:52] all things are possible to him that
[4:55] believeth
[4:57] now it's very important to understand
[4:59] that we can do nothing
[5:02] except believe
[5:04] amen
[5:06] many times we think that we need to get
[5:08] involved with something
[5:10] amen you may be seated
[5:12] the Lord had blessings you the reading
[5:13] of his word amen now pay very specific
[5:17] attention because when instruction is
[5:19] coming from the pulpit if you are not
[5:21] hearing what the minister is saying you
[5:23] will miss your blessing things will
[5:25] never come to pass in your life
[5:27] was Naaman asked to go and baptize in
[5:29] the River Jordan
[5:32] was that a specific instruction coming
[5:34] from the 5-4 ministry as long as he
[5:37] disobeyed it he never received his
[5:39] healing
[5:40] amen so angels are ministering Spirits
[5:44] coming through the fivefold ministry
[5:47] amen that's a quote of the Prophet amen
[5:50] hallelujah
[5:52] so you got to take specific instruction
[5:55] amen when the word of God is coming in
[5:58] order for you to live a fruitful and a
[6:00] successful life
[6:02] you can treat it casual and think it's
[6:04] just a word of a man amen and that's why
[6:06] you'll never see the manifestation
[6:08] amen so
[6:10] speaking something is one thing but
[6:12] Jesus is teaching Us in Mark 11 23 that
[6:15] man was supposed to be the the one who
[6:18] has dominion over the Earth
[6:20] he had no faith to believe his own word
[6:24] amen let's close that door he says
[6:27] if you believe
[6:30] what you have said
[6:32] shall come to pass
[6:37] now I want you to know Jesus did not say
[6:40] now I'm saying this for a specific
[6:42] reason because many times we think we
[6:44] need to get involved with the
[6:45] supernatural
[6:47] the only thing we need to do is
[6:48] cooperate with the spirit of God
[6:50] cooperate with the angel of God and
[6:53] believe the word it's already done
[6:56] if there's one thing I want you to
[6:58] understand it's already done at the
[6:59] cross of calvary
[7:01] there's nothing further you can do
[7:03] if you think okay I'm gonna get my
[7:05] healing by fasting and praying then
[7:07] that's you putting your own effort into
[7:08] it fasting and praying never healed
[7:11] anyone the only thing that heals what
[7:13] does fasting and praying do praying amen
[7:15] you're taking your prayer request before
[7:17] the Lord and fasting is bringing your
[7:19] flesh under subjection of the spirit man
[7:22] because the flesh is unbelief
[7:25] the flesh wants to disbelieve the things
[7:27] of God
[7:29] amen but the spirit man needs to rise up
[7:32] by faith and believe the things of God
[7:34] so fasting is to bring the body under
[7:36] subjection
[7:40] amen
[7:41] we need right teaching in the church
[7:43] because sometimes you come in the prayer
[7:45] line and and you think that Mark 16 is
[7:47] not effective and that your fasting and
[7:49] praying is more effective than mark 16.
[7:55] Mark 16 is the written word of God and
[7:57] it supersedes your natural fasting and
[7:59] praying
[8:00] the problem is the believing
[8:03] in John 3 16 if you put it up where's
[8:05] the quote the scriptures you put it up
[8:07] in John 3 16 does it say there God so
[8:10] loved the world
[8:11] that he gave his only begotten son that
[8:14] whosoever for goes to fasting and
[8:15] praying
[8:19] shall receive eternal life
[8:23] what must they do
[8:25] believe
[8:27] there is nothing you can do to your
[8:29] salvation to add to it
[8:32] there's nothing you can do to your
[8:33] healing to add to it
[8:36] foreign
[8:39] if the church gets this Revelation now
[8:41] she can do the Greater Works
[8:43] it was already done at Calvary
[8:46] but it seems that man does not want to
[8:48] believe these things
[8:50] we feel we need to go back to the law
[8:52] and add to it I need to do this my
[8:55] righteousness I need to do this
[8:59] but if you can just come to God and
[9:01] believe it Lord you said Lord but by
[9:03] your stripes I am already healed you say
[9:05] that on the cross when you bore my sin
[9:07] in your body on the cross my sin was
[9:10] taken away
[9:12] it was a Divine exchange that I
[9:15] understand you're sinless
[9:17] you see even with that we struggle
[9:20] that we confess things like I'm not
[9:22] perfect
[9:22] then you are not talking out of the
[9:24] abundance of your heart from the spirit
[9:26] man and thinking Looking Through The
[9:28] Eyes of Christ because Christ has made
[9:30] you perfect we say things like I am not
[9:33] righteous I am not perfect
[9:37] but then we are talking from a carnal
[9:39] point of view we are not looking to the
[9:41] finished work of the Cross and I stand
[9:43] here in his righteousness I stand you in
[9:45] his Perfection I stand you in his
[9:47] holiness
[9:51] amen praise the Lord
[9:53] amen hallelujah amen so
[9:58] let's get started that was just a warmer
[10:04] amen how many of you like warmers
[10:07] amen praise the Lord praise the Lord
[10:10] glory be to his name Amen Let me just
[10:12] give
[10:14] my notes to you then you can take this
[10:16] amen praise the Lord
[10:18] so we're looking at these three women
[10:21] and we were in Genesis Chapter 18 and we
[10:24] seem to have got a bit stuck there but
[10:26] it's fine because it's packed
[10:28] amen
[10:30] Genesis 18 he's packed
[10:33] and we find that
[10:35] Abraham is sitting at the plains of
[10:37] mamre if you go to Genesis 18 and we we
[10:40] learned already that a membrane means
[10:43] strength
[10:43] so he was now sitting at the place of
[10:45] strength
[10:47] when East strength was gone
[10:50] his strength is perfect
[10:53] when our strength is gone
[10:57] and this is what Abraham was singing
[10:58] that morning
[10:59] because in you now at the age of 99
[11:03] years old
[11:04] his strength was gone
[11:06] his ability to reproduce was gone
[11:10] but his strength is perfect
[11:12] when our strength is gone
[11:15] and Abraham was saying Sarah he'll carry
[11:18] us when we can't carry on
[11:22] amen
[11:25] Sarah was saying oh I don't know you
[11:27] know Sarah wasn't moving in faith in
[11:28] this time
[11:30] and she was saying hey I don't know and
[11:32] if you read this particular message you
[11:34] say Sarah was a little fussed that
[11:35] morning
[11:37] how many of you read that the prophet is
[11:40] dramatizing it and he says Sarah was a
[11:42] little fussed that morning
[11:43] and you know she was like thinking how
[11:46] Lot's wife has got this new dresses and
[11:48] the new fashions and here she's sitting
[11:50] in the desert
[11:54] amen here she's sitting in the desert
[11:57] while Lot's wife is enjoying the
[12:00] pleasures
[12:03] of Sodom and Gomorrah
[12:05] amen praise the Lord but we don't look
[12:08] to those things
[12:09] amen we look far above these things amen
[12:13] hallelujah praise the Lord
[12:18] now just for con so we remember we read
[12:20] that Genesis 18 right so he's sitting in
[12:22] the place of strength
[12:24] and I want to get to verse 10 there and
[12:26] this is
[12:27] so I'm going to speak a thought and
[12:29] maybe I'll title it the angel of the
[12:31] Lord performs a supernatural in another
[12:34] Mary
[12:36] amen
[12:38] the angel of the Lord right now is
[12:40] performing the supernatural in another
[12:42] Mary
[12:45] so 1810 he tells Abraham now you'll find
[12:48] the verses preceding this the Lord does
[12:51] not speak
[12:52] it's only Abraham moving into action and
[12:54] saying I'm going to do this I'm going to
[12:56] do this I'm going to do this I'm going
[12:57] to do this there's no word from Thee the
[13:00] angels
[13:03] when they finally settle down and they
[13:05] start to entertain his presence
[13:08] amen and yeah the prophet says that the
[13:11] house was in order therefore they they
[13:14] were amen candidates for the association
[13:17] to the ancient world
[13:20] they didn't have to go and hide
[13:22] magazines
[13:24] didn't have to put the TV off
[13:26] they didn't have to put the internet off
[13:31] amen
[13:33] and I'm if you know that he'll appear to
[13:35] you when you are thinking on him
[13:38] Abraham was not there on Google and uh
[13:41] looking at Facebook and looking at tick
[13:44] tock
[13:45] watching the clock tick tock tick tock
[13:48] tick tock so idle
[13:51] amen
[13:53] so either thinking and and they watch
[13:55] these things now because you'll hear it
[13:57] in your homes I'm so bored
[13:59] go watch a movie
[14:01] I'm so bored
[14:04] not once will we say could read this
[14:07] message I was blessed with this one
[14:10] or go read this chapter tell me what you
[14:13] think about it
[14:14] I'm so bored go listen to some music
[14:19] amen but obviously I'm not talking about
[14:21] you now I'm talking about Abraham and
[14:22] his family
[14:26] amen hallelujah we're not talking about
[14:28] anybody here amen hallelujah
[14:33] because
[14:34] you should see the Angelic looks around
[14:36] here
[14:37] I see those Halos amen maybe we can turn
[14:40] these monitors down a bit amen I see the
[14:42] Halos
[14:43] amen
[14:45] praise the Lord
[14:48] amen What Angels
[14:53] so here in verse 10 he says I will
[14:56] return
[14:58] and when he's coming back he's not
[14:59] coming without a vision without a goal
[15:01] without a purpose he is returning for a
[15:04] purpose
[15:07] I'm coming to thee according to the time
[15:09] of life
[15:10] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[15:15] now when you hear the word son you think
[15:17] about the Life of Christ
[15:19] that should be at the top of our mind it
[15:21] should be our goal
[15:25] we must produce the Life of Christ
[15:28] Sarah thy wife because yeah Isaac is
[15:30] going to type the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:33] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[15:36] Sarah heard it but Faith did not come by
[15:38] the hearing of this word
[15:40] she had to hear it again
[15:43] that's why the Bible says faith cometh
[15:45] by hearing and hearing
[15:50] there's a two hearing there
[15:53] the first time matchboxam curiosity that
[15:57] you laugh within yourself but at the
[15:59] second hearing amen hallelujah something
[16:02] raises up within you and Sarah judges
[16:04] him faithful
[16:09] Sarah heard it in the ten door she was
[16:11] behind him now we're going to drop two
[16:13] verse uh let's go 11 there Abraham and
[16:15] Sarah yeah re-emphasizing now that he's
[16:18] not going to be human interference Abram
[16:21] and Cyril were old and well-stricken in
[16:23] age and it seems to be with Sarah after
[16:26] the man of woman
[16:28] so what does it tell you she can't have
[16:29] children her body is old
[16:33] the prophet will go on to describe it
[16:34] you hear it in the messages the mug
[16:36] veins are dried up
[16:38] amen hallelujah
[16:40] she was past menopause so she couldn't
[16:43] physically according to science have a
[16:45] child
[16:47] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[16:49] saying after I am waxed old shall I have
[16:52] pleasure my Lord being old also
[16:56] some are thinking that I'm so old in the
[16:58] message you mean now I have to do
[17:00] certain things oh I'm too young in the
[17:02] message
[17:03] amen
[17:05] and the Lord said unto Abraham so
[17:08] everything is right now he's got the new
[17:09] name he's got the new nature the mystery
[17:12] of God is revealed to him everything he
[17:14] said in order for this Angelic
[17:16] visitation
[17:19] amen
[17:23] wherefore now here's the discernment
[17:25] with the back turned this is what the
[17:28] prophet is doing now according to Luke
[17:29] 17 30 as it was in the days
[17:33] so shall it be in the revealing of the
[17:36] son of man so the prophet would turn his
[17:38] back to the audience
[17:40] and you see your sister there on the
[17:42] left
[17:43] you have a tumor
[17:46] amen
[17:49] praise the Lord so the back turn to the
[17:52] tent he discerns Sarah's heart
[17:56] you watch even till today
[17:59] the people that want to move in an
[18:01] impersonation and an anointing study the
[18:04] life of William Branham
[18:06] in fact they studied more than you and I
[18:09] they study how to operate in the
[18:11] Supernatural you should hear them talk
[18:13] about it
[18:14] foreign
[18:16] because they're lusting after the gift
[18:18] after the anointing
[18:20] but they will never attain this level of
[18:22] anointing there's his guesswork because
[18:25] this was son of man being revealed
[18:27] through the prophet
[18:29] it was Jesus Christ being reproduced
[18:34] so he says shall I have now she laughs
[18:37] within herself but the love to carry
[18:40] some thoughts
[18:41] and the thoughts were he deserves what
[18:43] she was thinking now shall I of Surety
[18:46] be a child which I am hold
[18:49] now remember
[18:51] Abraham and the angel is having a
[18:54] conversation
[18:56] but
[18:58] the Lord is Discerning what Sarah is
[19:00] saying and suddenly he tells Abraham
[19:03] he's anything too hard for the Lord
[19:06] so Abraham is probably wondering what's
[19:07] happening here he doesn't know that
[19:09] Sarah's art is being discerned
[19:14] so he asked Abraham is anything too hard
[19:16] for the Lord
[19:18] and I don't think
[19:20] that the Lord's response
[19:24] was not with some kind of
[19:28] reprimand
[19:31] because somebody is just believing
[19:33] remember what
[19:35] what the prophet is teaching us now the
[19:37] Lord would have slower there
[19:39] for the unbelief
[19:42] he says but because of Abraham and that
[19:44] was the bidding ground for Isaac he
[19:47] couldn't kill her because the two were
[19:48] one Abraham and Sarah right is anything
[19:51] too hard for the Lord
[19:53] Abraham probably get startled
[19:56] at the appointed time I will return unto
[19:58] thee
[20:00] according to the time of life
[20:04] and Sarah shall have a son
[20:10] amen hallelujah
[20:13] praise the Lord
[20:15] amen
[20:15] oh glory be to his name amen
[20:19] Sarah thy wife shall have a son not
[20:21] eager
[20:22] not the Bond woman the free woman
[20:25] not that you know the national churches
[20:27] the free women
[20:32] amen then Sarah now watch she denied
[20:36] saying I laugh not
[20:38] for she was afraid
[20:40] and he said nay but thou teats laugh
[20:45] and that's all we hear about it
[20:48] amen the next year is when the Apostle
[20:50] Paul is talking about it and says Serve
[20:53] by faith Sarah judged him faithful
[20:59] amen why he discerned the heart she knew
[21:02] like the woman at the well nobody else
[21:05] knows that I taught these things nobody
[21:07] else knows about my life
[21:09] now I'm asking you is anything too out
[21:11] for the Lord some of you have given up
[21:14] on your prayer some of us have given up
[21:16] and you're believing
[21:17] on your trusting God some of you have
[21:20] decided that you're going to live with
[21:21] that sickness until death some of you
[21:24] have taken the doctor's report that this
[21:25] that's an incurable disease
[21:31] but is anything too hard for the Lord
[21:38] amen
[21:40] at the appointed time the Lord is going
[21:42] to touch you and deliver you what's your
[21:45] point of time God is waiting for you to
[21:47] believe
[21:48] Mark 9 23 if thou can't believe
[21:52] all things are possible
[21:58] amen
[22:00] now if you've been following the Angel's
[22:01] instruction from the beginning of the
[22:03] year you should be at a point now we are
[22:05] ready to believe all things are possible
[22:08] amen remember when the Lord is building
[22:11] he's not haphazard in his building
[22:13] we can't keep going back to the
[22:15] foundation
[22:17] even the Apostle Paul says it amen let
[22:20] us lay aside these things amen like
[22:22] baptisms and godheads and all of these
[22:24] things and let us move on to Perfection
[22:26] our goal is perfection
[22:33] amen praise the Lord so here we find an
[22:36] uh 89 year old woman
[22:38] that God is going to do a work now why
[22:41] is that chapter very important is
[22:42] because it's a hidden Mystery
[22:47] that these two nobody knows us now
[22:49] beside the message world
[22:51] because of a prophetic gift that Sarah
[22:54] and Abraham were changed back into a
[22:56] young body
[22:58] do you know that nobody else believes
[23:00] that besides you
[23:03] Sarah and Abraham were turned back into
[23:05] a young body
[23:08] amen so that is a type of what's going
[23:11] to happen to us now we have had that
[23:14] same Angel come back
[23:18] with a message to us
[23:20] so what is Genesis 18 from 1 to 15
[23:23] telling us about the creator of power of
[23:26] God
[23:28] and he's speaking the creator of power
[23:30] into you
[23:32] who spoke it
[23:35] did Abraham speak it
[23:38] who spoke creative power there
[23:42] I was not the one
[23:45] doing it
[23:46] I was only the vessel
[23:49] you'll tell him in the audience amen I
[23:52] don't know what the the angel just told
[23:53] you amen he's using my body you may have
[23:56] heard my voice but it was the angel of
[23:58] the Lord
[24:03] here in Luke 1 26 now
[24:06] the prophet is telling uh the the Bible
[24:08] here is writing and he's saying in the
[24:10] sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent
[24:13] from God unto a city of Galilee
[24:16] named Nazareth
[24:18] to a virgin espouse to a man whose name
[24:20] was Joseph right and the virgin's name
[24:23] was Mary now remember our topic is the
[24:26] Angel of the Lord is performing
[24:29] the supernatural in another Mary
[24:34] amen
[24:36] and the angel came in unto her and said
[24:38] hell
[24:39] Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with
[24:42] thee blessed are thou among women
[24:45] wouldn't you like to receive a
[24:46] salutation like that
[24:48] amen but you have received a salutation
[24:51] like that because you are another Mary
[24:55] amen amen
[24:58] the angels of God on earth now because
[25:00] of you
[25:02] or somebody now come on
[25:04] amen get your mind off of work get your
[25:07] mind off your chicken curry get your
[25:08] mind off your amen lunch amen focus on
[25:11] the things of God now these things are
[25:14] amen mean more to us than the Natural
[25:16] Things amen this is not for your soul
[25:18] this is now for your eternal life this
[25:21] is now for your new body and unless you
[25:23] connect with the Angel's message you
[25:25] will not receive the rapturing faith for
[25:26] this hour
[25:34] so I want you to know all of you believe
[25:36] the message of the hour you are highly
[25:38] favored amongst all you know I'm a
[25:39] national women
[25:48] and when he saw him she was troubled
[25:50] that he sing and cast to mind what man
[25:52] of salutation this should be
[25:54] right so she's not troubled at any other
[25:56] thing beside I mean you're calling me
[25:58] highly favored she's troubled at the
[26:01] saying and the angel said unto her fear
[26:03] not Mary for thou has found favor with
[26:05] god oh thank you Lord if you see
[26:08] yourself as Mary you start to Rejoice
[26:09] with these things now thank you Lord
[26:11] that I have found favor in your sight
[26:14] amen
[26:16] behold here's another one now who's this
[26:18] one talking the same one in Genesis 18.
[26:26] and the angel said unto her thou shall
[26:29] conceive in thy womb this is verse 31
[26:32] now and bring forth a son and his name
[26:35] Shall be Called Jesus
[26:38] first through Sarah it was a Shadow His
[26:40] Name Shall be Called Isaac now through
[26:43] Mary He Shall be Called Jesus
[26:48] oh and I can imagine
[26:50] can you imagine what an explosion there
[26:53] must have been in the Heavenly
[26:54] atmosphere at the first time this name
[26:55] was mentioned
[27:00] Faith cometh by the hearing of the word
[27:03] and the first time now somebody is
[27:05] hearing the name Jesus is Mary
[27:10] these other Jesus is out there
[27:13] but there's only one that believes
[27:15] there's only one Mary who believes the
[27:17] Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the
[27:20] new
[27:23] the others are trinitarians
[27:26] the others there's three unclean spirits
[27:29] like frogs who believes in a trinity
[27:30] gospel
[27:32] but there's only one woman who heard his
[27:35] name
[27:36] his name Shall be Called Jesus
[27:40] some of you think it's a Christmas
[27:41] message well Christmas is coming early
[27:47] receive the gifts
[27:51] don't wait for Christmas gifts the gifts
[27:53] is pouring itself out now

[28:00] and he shall be great oh thank you God
[28:02] that you are great he shall be called
[28:04] the son of the highest and the Lord God
[28:06] shall give unto him the Throne of his
[28:08] father David and he shall reign over the
[28:10] house of Jacob forever and his kingdom
[28:12] there shall be no end
[28:15] then sent Mary unto the angel how shall
[28:18] it be seeing I know no man
[28:22] and the angel answered unto and said
[28:24] unto her the Holy Ghost oh how we need
[28:27] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost shall come
[28:30] upon thee
[28:32] and the power of the highest shall
[28:34] overshadow thee
[28:36] therefore also that Holy thing
[28:39] which shall be born of thee shall be
[28:42] called the son of God
[28:44] amen
[28:46] and I want you to know that same Holy
[28:48] Ghost is here to birth The Life of
[28:50] Christ in you
[28:52] and Mary said now what's your response
[28:54] this is what makes Mary above all other
[28:57] women
[28:58] afraid to believe
[29:00] if thou can't believe
[29:01] then all things are possible
[29:04] and Mary said behold the handmaid of the
[29:06] Lord
[29:07] be it unto me according to Thy word I
[29:11] don't know if you want to say that this
[29:12] morning being unto me according to your
[29:14] word oh God I don't want to leave
[29:16] nothing out to God
[29:19] and the angel is satisfied and he
[29:21] departs from her it's as good as
[29:23] finished
[29:25] amen it's as good as finished
[29:33] the birth of the Supernatural is now
[29:35] going to perform in Mary what's
[29:36] happening
[29:37] yeah he's the spoken word
[29:40] there was not another time the spoken
[29:42] word came back the Angel's voice that
[29:44] said there
[29:49] in verse 35
[29:52] . in verse 31 and 35
[29:55] is the spoken word
[29:57] that is where the spoken word that is
[30:00] like what Adam was supposed to be
[30:02] speaking to Eve
[30:04] come on now let's go to Genesis Genesis
[30:07] there was not supposed to be a sexual
[30:09] affair
[30:10] to reproduce what you are seeing is what
[30:12] Adam is supposed to be doing he's
[30:14] supposed to go to Eve and say thou shalt
[30:17] have a son
[30:18] and his name Shall be Called Abel
[30:25] and Eve was supposed to say be it unto
[30:28] me
[30:29] according to Thy Word
[30:35] amen praise the Lord
[30:37] now let's go to our part
[30:39] we the Mary now
[30:41] and yo the same Angel talked to us
[30:43] Revelation 10 8.
[30:47] same Angel and we are so privileged to
[30:49] have a picture of it
[30:54] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[30:56] speak unto me again
[30:59] God can do it again
[31:01] I love it when he speaks to me again
[31:04] amen
[31:06] go and take the little book which is
[31:10] open in the hand of the angel with
[31:13] standard upon the sea and upon the Earth
[31:16] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[31:18] him give me the little book you see our
[31:21] association is directly with the angel
[31:23] of God
[31:25] you know we got married many elizabeths
[31:29] we got do you want to be an Elizabeth in
[31:31] the message of the hour or do you want
[31:33] to be a Mary
[31:37] because Elizabeth is only going to
[31:39] present
[31:40] John the Baptist
[31:43] but Mary is going to present the Christ
[31:47] we got many elizabeths presenting
[31:50] the second Forerunner
[31:54] come on religious message people
[31:57] we got many Elizabeth's in the message
[31:59] of the hour the only thing they talk
[32:01] about is John the Baptist
[32:07] but Mary another Mary
[32:11] when he's pick up your opinion right
[32:13] he's not saying as the word was in
[32:15] Elizabeth
[32:16] so shall the word be indeed
[32:19] he's saying as the word was in Mary
[32:24] so yeah give me the little book and he
[32:26] said take it instruction
[32:29] eat it
[32:33] and it shall make thy belly bitter and
[32:35] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[32:37] sometimes it feels like the faithful
[32:39] Ministry has to force your mouth open
[32:42] and push the word inside
[32:46] amen because of the unbelief of the
[32:48] people because of the spirits that's
[32:50] lingering around us amen that's bringing
[32:52] unbelief and fear and reasoning into the
[32:54] church this is supposed to be the most
[32:57] powerful Church the most Supernatural
[32:59] church amen with signs and wonders
[33:01] following amen
[33:02] not a dead Church a lazy Church a weak
[33:05] church and talking about the body of
[33:07] Jesus Christ the most powerful Army on
[33:09] the face of the Earth
[33:12] not artificial intelligence but Supreme
[33:14] intelligence they have the mind of
[33:17] Christ
[33:21] amen hallelujah
[33:23] and I took the book out of the Angel van
[33:25] and ate it up and it was in my mouth
[33:27] sweet as honey you see it's one thing to
[33:29] receive instruction
[33:31] it's another thing that you go and do it
[33:33] but John was the type of the bride goes
[33:36] and he takes that word they find these
[33:38] messages amen the scripture becomes more
[33:40] clear to them and they devour it amen
[33:45] it's sweet in your mouth you tell it to
[33:47] everybody but amen inside something it's
[33:50] killing the inner man oh sorry he's
[33:52] killing the outer man it's killing the
[33:54] flesh man
[33:56] it's bringing the flesh man under
[33:57] subjection
[34:00] sweet in your mouth but it's better in
[34:03] your belly in your flesh
[34:05] is the belly part of your flesh
[34:09] amen so my flesh is getting bitter
[34:13] my flesh is dying my flesh is rotting
[34:16] the more I eat of this word
[34:20] now it's not where it ends
[34:24] even if you go and read I don't have
[34:25] time right now because amen we need to
[34:27] move here if you go and read Luke one
[34:30] day after the angel comes to Mary after
[34:34] she meets Elizabeth
[34:36] go here Mary prophesying
[34:39] you know Mary prophesy
[34:42] so there's your homework go and read
[34:44] Luke chapter one and you'll see after
[34:46] she meets Elizabeth
[34:49] and the Babe leaps within Elizabeth
[34:52] Mary goes to prophesying
[34:55] come on that's the type now of this
[34:56] Revelation 10 11.
[34:58] Mary goes to prophesying maybe we should
[35:01] put it up because some of you won't go
[35:03] and read it
[35:04] amen put up Luke chapter one there let's
[35:07] find it after she meets Mary amen
[35:09] hallelujah
[35:11] praise the Lord
[35:13] some of you already said I'm not going
[35:14] to read it
[35:18] hey some of you already said I'll wait
[35:20] for Christmas to read it
[35:22] that's my Christmas stories
[35:24] amen let's put it up let's make time
[35:27] because it's very important to show you
[35:29] that as the word was in Mary and she
[35:31] went to prophesying now you saw John
[35:33] taking the book and the word is what is
[35:35] the word Jesus said the word is a
[35:37] this is direct Bible now the word is a
[35:40] seed
[35:43] so when John is taking the word he's
[35:45] receiving seed
[35:49] let me tell you something that this
[35:51] message of the hour that you eat can
[35:52] produce nothing else but the Life of
[35:54] Christ
[35:58] yes she's now prophesying and my soul
[36:01] don't magnify the Lord
[36:04] and my spirit had rejoiced in God my
[36:06] savior
[36:08] for here regard to the lowest state of
[36:10] his handmade and Beyond from henceforth
[36:12] all generations shall call me blessed
[36:16] right
[36:17] for he that is mighty had done to me
[36:19] great things and holy is his name
[36:21] watches and start to
[36:24] step up a prophecy now and his Mercy is
[36:26] on them that fear Him from generation to
[36:28] generation
[36:31] he had shown strength with his arm and
[36:33] he had scattered the proud in the
[36:35] imaginations of their hearts
[36:37] he had put down the mighty from the
[36:39] seats and exalted them of low degree
[36:43] he had filled the angry with good things
[36:45] and the rich he had sent empty away
[36:48] Jesus is not even born yet
[36:52] but she is seeing those things is
[36:54] already finished
[36:57] he had holy oh open helped his servant
[37:01] Israel in remembrance of his Mercy amen
[37:04] and it's as you speak to our fathers
[37:06] Abraham and to his seed forever
[37:09] amen
[37:12] so she goes to prophesy
[37:15] she's talking about it as it's a
[37:16] finished work
[37:18] amen
[37:19] she's only
[37:21] so Mary was
[37:22] I think she just at that time I just
[37:24] conceived
[37:26] Elizabeth was six months old when she
[37:28] meets the baby in Elizabeth
[37:30] was just six months old
[37:35] right not even six months old what am I
[37:37] saying she was caring for six months
[37:40] amen she was just catering for six
[37:43] months with child so look at how Mary
[37:45] goes to prophesy and that's the type
[37:47] here now I hope you can see it but
[37:49] clearly now
[37:51] that you are the Mary
[37:52] that is taking the book from the hand of
[37:54] the angel
[37:55] the same angel that spoke to Mary
[37:58] the same angel that spoke to Sarah
[38:03] how many angels Don't Die
[38:06] there's never been a funeral service for
[38:08] an angel
[38:09] amen hallelujah
[38:12] amen praise the Lord and I'm so glad
[38:15] that this morning the angel of the Lord
[38:18] that's here he's looking at you and
[38:19] saying you know what I last saw that
[38:21] faith in in Branham I lost saw that kind
[38:24] of faith in Paul

[38:28] Allah for that kind of faith
[38:30] in Mary

[39:53] another Mary okay so you got now verse
[39:56] 11 there of Revelation 10 thou must
[39:58] prophesy again before many peoples
[40:00] Nations tongues and kings
[40:03] amen so nine months has passed and it's
[40:06] time
[40:07] to do a spiritual sonogram
[40:10] you know what's the sonogram now brother
[40:11] Caleb
[40:13] you don't know what do you go for scans
[40:15] or you call it scan
[40:17] ultrasound you call it
[40:19] it's the same thing okay
[40:22] just update your memory there
[40:25] we are doing a spiritual sonogram
[40:30] and some of your sisters helped me you
[40:32] know there's some women who think they
[40:34] are pregnant and they're not
[40:36] what they call it
[40:38] is it Braxton something
[40:41] that's a phantom pregnancy
[40:44] do you know there's some women who
[40:46] actually believe that they are pregnant
[40:49] but when they go to the doctor they're
[40:51] not pregnant
[40:55] this is something you don't know these
[40:57] things right
[40:59] now
[41:01] we are doing a spiritual sonogram on you
[41:04] you know what that is some of you don't
[41:05] know what that is so
[41:07] a woman when she's pregnant after
[41:10] certain weeks how many weeks is it
[41:12] after how many weeks you go how many
[41:14] months come on sisters who had babies
[41:15] just tell me
[41:17] amen halleluia amen thank you Lord
[41:22] how many weeks
[41:27] 12 weeks okay now you go to the doctor
[41:31] they woke you up to this machine they
[41:33] put some gel there and they put this
[41:35] thing on you
[41:37] and then machine now projects an image
[41:42] and you can see some life
[41:45] and that doctor is going to town then
[41:47] he's measuring this and you can't see
[41:49] nothing there
[41:50] but he's saying you can see you saying
[41:52] yeah I can see it
[41:56] it's the leg here this is the leg you
[41:58] say yeah that's a leg bone this is this
[42:00] this is that you're believing everything
[42:01] he's saying
[42:03] amen now if you can believe the doctor
[42:06] that way how about you believe the
[42:07] ministers that way
[42:09] whatever they're showing you in the word
[42:10] about yourself
[42:12] even if you don't know what that they're
[42:14] telling you this is your leg you say yes
[42:15] that's my leg
[42:18] amen so they start to put that sonogram
[42:21] and they start to see that baby there
[42:23] then they can identify as heartbeat
[42:26] and they place it there that strategic
[42:28] point and they leave it there
[42:30] and okay that's another thing on another
[42:32] machine and it registers the heartbeat
[42:35] and they can tell you the heartbeat of
[42:36] the baby
[42:38] amen so I'm saying the holy spirit is
[42:41] here this morning and he's doing a
[42:42] spiritual sonogram
[42:47] it's been nine months
[42:49] but if your baby is only three months
[42:51] something is wrong
[42:53] developed three months
[42:56] some of it and what I am talking about
[42:58] is what you've been praying about
[43:01] because this is how man is
[43:04] man don't believe his own word
[43:06] but God is putting you back in that
[43:08] position
[43:09] if you can believe you know you believe
[43:11] unto salvation
[43:13] you just have to believe that Jesus did
[43:15] it all
[43:17] there's nothing else you can do but
[43:19] believe
[43:22] amen healing is the same way the prophet
[43:25] says if you can believe that the Lord
[43:27] has saved you he says it's the same
[43:29] thing that the Lord has healed you now I
[43:31] want you to know this and I'm making a
[43:32] strong statement here
[43:34] when Jesus Christ you know they say the
[43:37] 39 Stripes was for every disease
[43:40] why I'm saying it's a strong statement
[43:43] I even want heaven to hear this this
[43:45] morning
[43:46] that all manner of diseases were taken
[43:49] care of at the cross
[43:52] so there's not a sickness on the Earth
[43:54] today
[43:56] that Jesus Christ didn't pay the price
[43:58] for
[44:00] come on now
[44:01] I don't need to bring Jesus back down to
[44:04] earth and whoop him for one more
[44:05] sickness
[44:10] are you hearing what I'm saying
[44:12] don't think that your sickness is
[44:13] incurable if you are telling me your
[44:16] sickness is incurable you're telling me
[44:18] that I need to bring Jesus back on the
[44:19] earth now and give him one more stripe
[44:21] for that sickness
[44:24] that the doctor is saying is incurable
[44:27] tell him doctor you may say it's
[44:29] incurable but the Bible says that by his
[44:31] stripes I am healed
[44:37] and when Jesus resurrected again he
[44:39] resurrected in a glorified body and
[44:42] every wound on his back was healed he is
[44:45] not standing here with a gaping open
[44:46] wound
[44:48] every hoon is healed and body you've got
[44:51] to obey my confession
[44:53] now you really got to confess and
[44:54] believe don't stand there and confess
[44:56] with your mouth and you don't believe in
[44:57] your heart it won't work
[44:59] this is now instruction to the church
[45:02] when you speak you've got to believe in
[45:04] your heart confess with your mouth and
[45:06] believe in your heart
[45:07] stop thinking Jesus is a lucky charm you
[45:10] need to believe
[45:12] don't you think I'm just gonna hurt it
[45:13] casually and then you go on living a
[45:15] life of unbelief
[45:18] amen let's just get to our quotes
[45:20] quickly amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[45:22] praise the Lord

[45:33] even know what was the matter with him

[45:45] that little boy and called him told him

[47:46] Prophet is saying look Zechariah stayed
[47:48] right there when the angel left him he
[47:50] was stricken dumb you see Zacharias does
[47:52] believe the angel and he went down
[47:55] maybe that's why people can't say Amen
[47:57] they're just believing the Angel's
[47:59] message is coming fresh now they are
[48:01] disbelieving the Angel's message going
[48:02] to them from the pulpit
[48:04] so amen so sometimes amen maybe I get
[48:08] angry with you don't say Amen but maybe
[48:10] you're like Zacharias you struck dumb
[48:13] because of the unbelief in your heart

[52:14] been healed of this she had to believe
[52:16] the impossible you tell the doctor well

[52:48] prophet is saying is going to shock you
[52:50] because you think we're pulling out
[52:51] these things about spare parts missing

[53:31] but when you believe the impossible
[53:34] if the doctor says you've got cancer and
[53:36] you're dying you've got to believe the
[53:38] impossible to see new life take a hold
[53:40] of you
[53:42] so you never ever confess and tell
[53:45] anyone that I have cancer
[53:47] you tell everyone I have I don't know
[53:49] what the right term is
[53:51] for the cells but you tell them all my
[53:53] cells are healthy

[56:27] got no evidence of it
[56:31] only his word oh I like that I think
[56:34] right now stop wait a minute and I said
[56:37] I Don't Preach to everyone that lives
[56:39] right on the highway I have to go down
[56:41] the lane sometimes to pick up somebody
[56:43] you see that's what we're doing this
[56:45] morning we're coming down to you you
[56:47] thought you had to live with a certain
[56:48] thing you thought amen there's no hope
[56:50] for you
[56:52] amen you know I'm gonna say this now
[56:55] when the prophet is saying whatever it
[56:56] is some of us are thinking just in the
[56:58] realm of the five senses the body I am
[57:01] saying the holy spirit is going beneath
[57:02] that right now there's some that are
[57:04] struggling with loneliness here
[57:07] you know loneliness is a real thing that
[57:09] can lead to depression that can lead to
[57:11] anxiety make you insecure about yourself
[57:14] amen make you think that nobody loves
[57:17] you nobody cares about you but the holy
[57:19] spirit is Discerning your heart and he's
[57:21] telling you he can go into your spirit
[57:23] realm and heal your memory your
[57:25] conscience your imagination
[57:27] your affection
[57:31] amen
[57:34] you know in the night amen when you're
[57:36] crying yourself to sleep
[57:37] because you're feeling lonely
[57:40] and you think that nobody's for
[57:41] everyone's forgotten about you and
[57:43] nobody loves you
[57:44] you've forgotten that there's one who
[57:46] said I will never leave you nor forsake
[57:48] you
[57:49] lo I will be with you always
[57:51] amen hallelujah
[57:55] so drive out every negative word you
[57:57] don't receive any negative word and
[58:00] allow you to settle in your spirit when
[58:02] they tell you you are ugly when they
[58:04] tell you amen you are good for nothing
[58:05] when they tell you amen hallelujah all
[58:09] men of things I'm talking to you school
[58:10] children now because that's where
[58:11] bullying goes on
[58:13] and that's awaken and suppress your
[58:15] spirit man within you you can never rise
[58:17] up the child is never free
[58:19] you find the child goes into a shell and
[58:21] it becomes reserved because they are
[58:23] hearing words that have spoken to them
[58:27] and they never ever hear Mommy and Daddy
[58:30] tell them you are beautiful
[58:32] they never ever hear that you are the
[58:34] best thing that ever happened to me and
[58:36] they never hear those words I love you
[58:39] now I'm saying this because you younger
[58:42] folks here younger brothers and sisters
[58:43] you need to change that pattern
[58:46] because amongst the Indian Community it
[58:48] was a bit taboo to tell somebody you
[58:49] love them
[58:51] and maybe the Indian Community didn't
[58:53] express it or verbalize it that way
[58:56] they thought maybe by just doing things
[58:58] and providing for it that they'll be
[59:00] able to see my love expressed
[59:02] amen
[59:04] but we are living in the time of the
[59:05] spoken word
[59:08] amen
[59:10] because sometimes all the child can
[59:11] maybe just read is because when you're
[59:14] angry with them
[59:15] you don't keep quiet
[59:19] they they hear those words being coming
[59:21] out of your mouth
[59:22] now when you're happy with them they
[59:24] don't hear anything good
[59:27] you're like oh child read my mind father
[59:29] loves you from the depth of his heart
[59:34] we are living in the time of the spoken
[59:35] word
[59:36] how many of you want to break
[59:37] generational curses
[59:39] how many of you want to change the
[59:40] atmosphere
[59:41] Hallelujah
[59:43] praise the Lord praise the Lord you know
[59:45] when you're living in the Supernatural
[59:47] realm your flesh man you you do things
[59:50] with that hey this flesh man starts to
[59:52] get puzzled and sing hey what's wrong
[59:53] with this brother the sister

[59:58] son and tell son I'm proud of you
[1:00:01] I love you
[1:00:03] hey that sound is like you
[1:00:05] I need aircon here
[1:00:08] hey
[1:00:10] praise the Lord
[1:00:12] amen

[1:00:16] season now we're new hand new harm new
[1:00:19] lungs new stomach whatever it is God
[1:00:22] would do it for you if you take him at
[1:00:23] his word

[1:00:28] amen some of you trust in the Lord for a
[1:00:31] partner in this life
[1:00:34] you need to trust the Lord and seek him
[1:00:37] amen go read Genesis there 24.

[1:01:57] and she took it to the cell phone shop
[1:01:58] and they tried to repair it they
[1:01:59] couldn't repaid so she brought it back
[1:02:01] home and she prayed for the phone
[1:02:05] and she says the phone is working and
[1:02:06] that was a testimony now right so then
[1:02:09] that caught my attention now I said hey

[1:02:49] at my phone and I see the battery
[1:02:51] percentage is a certain number
[1:02:55] when I saw that the first thing that
[1:02:57] struck my mind was because remember the
[1:02:59] number is tied to the angel of the Lord
[1:03:00] the first thing that said I need to pull
[1:03:03] this thing I look at the phone and there
[1:03:04] it is charging

[1:03:15] something came there and sorted that
[1:03:17] phone out
[1:03:20] did he say whatever it is did Jesus say
[1:03:23] in Mark 9 23 put that scripture up again
[1:03:25] if thou can't believe
[1:03:28] only the things that I dictate to you
[1:03:31] shall be possible
[1:03:33] Jesus said all things are possible do
[1:03:37] you know that this is a scripture that
[1:03:39] they wrote that song only believe out of
[1:03:42] Mark 9 23.
[1:03:45] how many of you are remembering it Mark
[1:03:47] 9 23 remember this verse he thou can't
[1:03:50] believe all things are possible to him
[1:03:52] that believeth all things are possible
[1:03:55] to you
[1:03:58] amen you know there they was telling
[1:04:00] this MOS the prophet calls him most they
[1:04:03] was going to send him into this place
[1:04:05] and he says Moses you believe the word
[1:04:07] of God so much he says yes
[1:04:09] he says whatever what happens if I tell
[1:04:11] you run through this wall yeah
[1:04:12] he says I believe the word so much that
[1:04:15] if the word of God tells me that I need
[1:04:17] to run through that wall by the time I
[1:04:19] get to that wall there shall be a exit
[1:04:20] there a hole in the wall for me to go
[1:04:22] through it
[1:04:25] but now the psalmist said he put it
[1:04:28] there in Prophecy shall we leap over
[1:04:30] walls
[1:04:32] that leap of a walls means shall we
[1:04:33] change dimensions
[1:04:37] shall we run through a troop
[1:04:40] when the when he is writing it he's not
[1:04:43] aware that there's going to be 200
[1:04:44] million demons on the Earth
[1:04:46] a troop
[1:04:48] he's not aware that Revelation amen
[1:04:51] chapter 6 he's going to talk about the
[1:04:52] fourth house Rider who's a writer's name
[1:04:54] is death and Hell follows him
[1:04:56] and he's given power to kill with sword
[1:04:58] with famine
[1:05:00] amen
[1:05:03] so watch these things
[1:05:05] we are going to leap over a wall
[1:05:08] we are going to change dimensions
[1:05:10] amen before I believe before you see it
[1:05:13] change amen let's just go to this one
[1:05:15] quote here I have so much here but
[1:05:17] unfortunately
[1:05:19] I don't have time to go through all of
[1:05:20] it right now amen we'll take it up in
[1:05:22] another service
[1:05:25] amen praise the Lord
[1:05:41] praise the Lord amen
[1:05:44] let's go to that slide 17. we'll close
[1:05:46] on this one
[1:05:48] because we believe we are in another
[1:05:50] time like Enoch right he says now as we
[1:05:53] see the time that Nimrod had brought all
[1:05:55] the Confederation together have they
[1:05:57] brought one world religion now have you
[1:05:59] noticed how the pope has gone out of the
[1:06:00] spotlight
[1:06:01] you don't hear much about him because
[1:06:03] the peace agreements have all been
[1:06:05] signed the final agreement for world
[1:06:07] religions to unite has been signed
[1:06:09] already
[1:06:10] so who's in the news
[1:06:12] USA
[1:06:14] right
[1:06:15] remember it's that's Revelation 13 now
[1:06:18] and made all people come to Babylon and
[1:06:20] come into this great Confederation are
[1:06:22] we in another Babylon and the time of
[1:06:24] all evil going on between women sexually
[1:06:27] and so forth at the same time God had a
[1:06:30] witness on Earth Enoch
[1:06:32] we are the Enoch right who walked with
[1:06:34] God blameless and at the same time that
[1:06:37] evil was appearing Angels appeared on
[1:06:40] Earth
[1:06:41] now you didn't know that right
[1:06:43] you can't read that in the Bible
[1:06:47] hello
[1:06:49] but the prophet is telling you what
[1:06:51] happened to Enoch
[1:06:53] Angels appeared on the earth Angelic
[1:06:55] beings moved in to man
[1:07:01] amen
[1:07:06] praise the Lord
[1:07:07] our association with the angel of the
[1:07:09] Lord
[1:07:10] amen we told you that Mark 11 23 11 is
[1:07:14] the eleventh hour Gentile workers
[1:07:16] Exodus 23 23 behold I send my an angel
[1:07:19] before thee
[1:07:21] so our association with the Angelic
[1:07:23] world
[1:07:24] amen so just I pray amen you gleaned
[1:07:27] from that this morning that the angel of
[1:07:29] the Lord is on earth now to perform the
[1:07:31] supernatural in another Mary
[1:07:34] how many of you believe that
[1:07:36] amen that the Lord can do exceedingly
[1:07:39] abundantly in your heart in your life
[1:07:41] now I want you to get this anything you
[1:07:43] believe in the Lord for
[1:07:46] when you speak it check if it's just in
[1:07:49] your head I'm telling you this now to
[1:07:51] give you instruction check whether when
[1:07:54] you're speaking it
[1:07:56] don't leave it till you find it settled
[1:07:58] in your heart and you're at peace with
[1:08:00] it because the word of God says when you
[1:08:03] confess with your mouth
[1:08:04] and believe in your heart
[1:08:06] if you find you're confessing with your
[1:08:08] mouth and it's up here only then it's
[1:08:10] head knowledge it's head Faith nothing
[1:08:12] is going to happen
[1:08:13] so you've got to hear that word over
[1:08:15] again spend time with Mark 9 23 spend
[1:08:18] time with Mark 11 23 look at the
[1:08:20] scriptures of God that will build your
[1:08:22] faith
[1:08:23] for that situation
[1:08:25] the prophet says if you have need of
[1:08:26] healing he says focus on the scriptures
[1:08:28] that deal with healing
[1:08:30] call up Isaiah 53 call up 1 Peter 2 24
[1:08:33] read the scriptures
[1:08:36] read the gospels how Jesus healed
[1:08:39] surround yourself with the scriptures
[1:08:41] that deal with healing and your faith
[1:08:43] will increase
[1:08:46] amen
[1:08:48] so when you are praying for something
[1:08:50] didn't Jesus say if you believe in your
[1:08:52] heart
[1:08:54] so check that one thing because I find
[1:08:56] that's one thing that you yourself can
[1:08:58] know trigger whether that prayer is
[1:09:00] going to be answered or not because
[1:09:01] Jesus says believe that you have already
[1:09:03] received what you have asked for but
[1:09:06] you'll know if it's just here
[1:09:08] you're just praying it mindlessly oh
[1:09:10] Lord I heard the preacher saying that
[1:09:11] now how the past is saying this so I'm
[1:09:13] just going to pray Lord I believe I
[1:09:14] received it but let it settle in your
[1:09:17] heart
[1:09:17] if you can believe in your heart
[1:09:20] then you can have what you have said
[1:09:22] amen amen Give the Lord a good handclap
[1:09:25] of Praise amen
[1:09:28] let's Stand Together
[1:09:30] amen praise the Lord so the angel of the
[1:09:32] Lord is here right now
[1:09:34] to perform the supernatural in you in me
