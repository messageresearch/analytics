we have many things to reflect upon amen and if we track our spiritual journey through the year the Lord has been Faithfully leading us amen amen taking us into higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost amen amen and one thing about our God is not a backward God he's always forward moving amen he's got a plan he's got a program and he's pushing the church and moving the church amen if the church can only follow the angel of the Lord they will be led in the Supernatural yes amen if they are not following the angel of the Lord they'll be led into dry places into church Theology and church religion amen just settle for a good religion good morals amen but being led by the angel of God must be through a supernatural root amen so the church amen is on the move and we are thankful for what the Lord is doing not only here in Durban South Africa but what he is doing around the world we are seeing a sweeping Global move of the Lord Jesus Christ amen through the Holy Spirit In The Bride of Jesus Christ now is he building the church amen through his word amen that's why he revealed the word amen that's why Seven Seals had to be opened the entire Mysteries of the kingdom of God will revealed to an end time people now we can't place enough value on that that is the ultimate the opening of the word that's what Revelation 10:7 was about this Mighty Prophet would come amen and it would be an instrument used that God would reveal the word through him amen so we have all the mysteries of God now opened up to us we have water baptism we have goded amen we have church order we have marriage and divorce we have amen even future home amen we have things that are to be we have the Rapture the shout voice and Trump we can go on and on Amen who is this MZ we have all these wonderful mystery truths revealed to us amen and it's revealed to us for a purpose is because he's revealing his mind to his bride amen the mysteries of redemption being revealed to us amen so we welcome every one of you amen we have amen visiting with us is it brother aashan you said adash sorry brother adash Amen brother adash and sister Rebeca with their children here this morning amen if you're not familiar who that is that's a late Pastor uh Joseph amen that's his daughter amen let's welcome them this morning amen God bless you brother and I pray amen you'll be blessed this morning even as the word of God is being ministered amen hallelujah you'll find an Abiding Place in your heart to receive the word of God Amen so amen it let us use it as a time as well as we are going down now into the new year and winding up the old year is to track our spiritual journey and our spiritual progress amen uh maybe you are tracking other things in your life how much you made this year amen what you've achieved this year what you managed to buy I ask you sincerely don't reduce the gospel to material things amen that's right amen amen amen it's too precious to be reduced to material things amen I notice there's a there's a trend and a move yes the blessings of God are there but that's not why we were redeemed to buy a better house in a better car and to claim this and receive this that don't reduce God to that now that he called us into the message of the hour to give us things and make our life comfortable you're on the earth remember we at the closing scenes of the Gentile dispensation on amen amen so if anything we ought to be amen getting more urgent the Bible says even as we see the day fast approaching we are to gather more often amen we are to pray amen so if we starting with some basic things let's track our prayer life let's track our Bible reading that's right amen let's track our church attendance let's start with those Basics and see have we been faithful with the little things because God won't Overlook those things you know the prophet of God would teach us if you want to have a Revival he says start to read your Bible and pray every day amen now that's a that's a discipline that must be in still in a Believer we cannot force you to do that if you are interested in your spiritual growth these are the spiritual disciplines you will put in place in your life amen amen I also want to say that we are not having the service earlier to clear up your schedule for the day amen this is the day of worship yes amen amen Sunday is the day of worship amen amen so I just want to say that we are not doing that so that we can uh get Church out the way and have the rest of the day free it's not why we're doing it it's a day of worship in fact if the church calls for another service in the evening all the church should be here amen because it's a day of worship amen the uh the tradition was to gather on a Saturday on the Sabbath amen but when Jesus Christ came he rose on that first day of the week and after that the disciples started to gather on the Sunday amen amen amen in remembrance of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so it was always considered a day of worship and it also got amen entwined into our culture it's only in in a few years maybe 20 30 years now that they are opening stores on a Sunday prior to that everything would shut down nothing would be opened it was a day consecrated to the Lord for worship so when I ask you now you come into the house of the Lord this morning have you worshiped when the songs were being sung have you worshiped amen when the prayers were being offered amen many people think they're not a part of it when they when the brother is saying let us all Worship the Lord now let us start to pray amen that's your part of the service amen hallelujah so I don't want you to get the impression that I'm trying to make your life comfortable and get church out the way way so that you can do your own things it's a day of worship amen we are doing this because of the weather exclusively because of the weather to make it more comfortable for you to hear the word of God Amen so you know this day of worship was called the day of the Lord amen it's called The Lord's day am and John was caught up in the spirit on the Lord's day amen so he's receiving Revelation on the Lord's day amen so that's how important the Sunday amen this to honor the resurrection of the Lord is is now we are getting caught up in the Lord's day amen so always remember it's a day of worship it's a day of consecration amen once I leave these Church doors I I I can't forget about my Lord amen in fact the holy spirit in you won't make you forget even when you want to go home and you want to put a Netflix on or showx on or you're putting YouTube on the Holy Spirit In You checks you amen and you'd rather listen to a sermon than to indulge in entertainment yes amen amen that's the Holy Spirit now at work the Holy Spirit won't feed on social media and things of those things amen and make you feel comfortable with those things yes yes so that's a good sign to check have I got the Holy Spirit am I feeding on the right things amen am I feeding on the word of God is my heart constantly my mind constantly fixed on the Lord Jesus Christ I pray this morning you will have an experience with the Lord Jesus Christ you may have been in church you may have come to church for a long time but I pray this morning you will definitely have an experience with the Lord Jesus Christ amen that your life will never be the same from today on Amen so just an announcement for Tuesday service amen Tuesday is the 31 right it's our watch Night Service amen our crossover service going into 2025 so we'll start the service shop at 90000 p.m. Amen to give you enough time Amen to give you a testimony you know what I found this year that people are not ready for the sons of God you know Romans 8 says all creation is groaning and in travail waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the same scene that transpired 2,000 years ago is transpiring again people were not ready for the Son of God when Jesus came into the world it's the same condition again now people are not ready for the manifestation of the sons of God amen amen and I tell you I've experienced this so much and I've seen it amen it's like a a rejection of the sons of God when sons are moving in authority and power and the power of God to be displayed people are not ready for it people just want to be left alone with their lives because we're living in a comfortable age they earn enough money they got enough food they got enough clothing so people are not ready for the manifestation of the sons of God do you hear me what I'm saying amen amen people want to have a casual approach to it the only time they want to seek God is when they are sick is when they are going through financial problems that's the only time they look for God but I pray amen that won't be us say Lord try me and search my heart amen yes amen we really want to be Sons and Daughters of God we really want to be amen a part of his economy and a part of his kingdom we don't want to be playing church so we'll start the service at 900 p.m. and why I'm saying that you'll find that on W on Tuesday you'll see the Bible says that we ought to be giving praises to God it shouldn't be a forced to fear so if you're really thankful For What the Lord Has Done you come with your testimony you come with Praises you come with your song item amen and you start to Worship the Lord now some of you have already made up your mind you will not testify you will never praise the Lord I ask you to change your mindset amen come and give God praise amen amen if you want to thank anyone for the pasture and how the Lord has had his hand over your life then there's we are giving you the opportunity so we'll start the service at 9:00 p.m. amen the song service will start then we'll go into your amen songs your testimonies amen hallelujah the praise reports and start to reflect and thank the Lord for what he has done amen amen I challenge you if you if you've already determined you're too shy I tell you even write it down and come and give God praise this is not amen just kept for the older people even the young people the Lord may have walked somehow in your life spoken to you amen come and give God praise amen amen owe it to our Lord Jesus Christ to give him praise amen and I pray amen over the the year that we've been preaching even the ministering brothers that have been preaching that somehow amen you have grown spiritually your walk with the Lord has grown amen you have you have learned more about the kingdom of God Amen you've learned about amen the principles of God and how to apply it in your life amen amen amen why am I saying it this way is because you can't go through the first year of college and having gone through that year and then say you didn't achieve anything second year of college third year of college amen so years teaching Holy Ghost teaching how have you applied it to your life and how has it built you up amen if we are if we are just like uh being depleted after the service and then refilling another service something is wrong because the bride in Matthew 25 has a reserve tank yes amen there's a continual oil flowing continual word flowing amen so I pray amen that we'll come prepared for that and then amen you know that we generally have Fellowship after the service so you come prepared for that as well amen and we'll just have a wonderful time in the Lord and amen just celebrate amen our Lord Jesus Christ worship him give him glory while the world celebrates in their way yeah yeah we can worship our Lord amen amen enter the New Year the right way amen so come prepared we will take communion we will do foot washing amen and we will have a wonderful time of Fellowship amen let's stand together even as we sing a song Amen our brother Joshua will be sharing the word of God this morning so amen you just pull on the word of God you pull on the gift of God and I pray amen that even as the Holy Spirit

amen we give praise glory and honor to the name of Jesus Christ amen can you hear me now bless man this is much better what should should we go to the mic okay let's see how it goes can you hear me in the back amen amen if we got our Bibles this morning let's turn to the book of EX Exodus reading from chapter 24 verse 12 Exodus 24:12 amen uh we have come to the last Sunday of 2024 amen we thank God for the things that he's done for us in this year amen amen amen you know we have failed God many times in our lives but he never failed us he's always faithful amen and his word can never fail amen amen amen and we thank God for the many things that he's done the many blessings that he's blessed us with throughout this year as we tap along our spiritual journey you know on your spiritual journey no one is perfect you must fall on the way side but if you're a seed of God Amen you can't remain in that condition amen amen a seed of God must wake up amen and he must continue the journey the seed of God knows that he's searching for his City whose Builder and maker is God Amen of God know that he's a pilgrim amen so Journey he knows that he's not building his Empire in this world he know that his riches don't lie in this world Amen his treasures don't lie in in Earthly vessels Amen in Earth vessels because we're M and lust do corrupt but he's looking for an eternal City amen he's looking for the Eternal promise amen the book of Exodus reading from chapter 24 chapter 24 from verse 12 so just realizing Now it's 12 MTH in the year 2024 and the Lord said unto Moses come up to me into the mount and be there and I will give thee tables of stone and a law and Commandments which I have written amen that thou mayest teach them and Moses rose up and his minister Joshua and Moses went up into the Mount of God and he said unto the elders carry ye year for us until we come again unto you and behold Aaron and her are with you if any man have any matters to do let him come unto them and Moses went up into the mount and a cloud covered the mount and the glory of the Lord Abode upon Mount siai and the cloud covered in six days and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud amen it had to be the seven day amen amen in the seven day we know what happened God had to have a prophet amen and he had to be caught up in the mountain there in the cloud amen amen and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel and Moses went into the midst of the cloud didn't we have Propet that went into the mid of the cloud and get up into the Mounds and Moses was in the mount 40 days and 40 nights amen you may be seated where we proceed we also turn to the Book of Exodus 25 Exodus 25 and the Lord spoke spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children children of Israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart he shall take my offering oh he and this is the offering which they shall take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and Scarlet and fine linen and goats and RAM Sky skins dyed red and badges skin and shittam wood all for the light spices for anointing oil and for sweet incense ir ston and stones to be set in a heid and in the breastplate and and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them amen so here's the Lord's desire now he wants to make this uh Tabernacle that he may come and dwell amongst men amen amen but remember now he's not this is under the blood of bull and goats yeah he can't dwell in man but he has to dwell in a sanctuary in a holy place where now he can be amongst the people amen amen but that wasn't God's ultimate desire God don't want to just be amongst the people amen God want to be in the people amen so we also look at Exodus 34: 1-5 and the Lord said unto Moses you use the two tables of stone like unto the first and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first table which thou break us you know what happened there because after Moses received uh uh the tables uh the Commandments and he went to the people they was in disarray and they were worshiping this Idol and so forth and then Moses vexed in his Spirit had to break the stone but now this is the second time now and so and and the Lord said to him and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto Mount saai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount and no man shall come up with thee neither let any any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before the mount and he h two tables of stone like unto the first and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto Mount siai as the Lord had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone and the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord amen amen also very quickly we'll go to Second Corinthians Chapter 3 The Book of 2 Corinthians CH 3: 2 to8 Paul is saying Ye Ye are our Epistles written in our Arts known and read of all men for as much as they are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink yeah Paul is taking them to the Revelation amen that they are no no longer people that something to be written about amen but you are now a manifestation of what's written Amen in the days of Moses God was hiding behind bad of skin amen and there it was written the the word of God was put on tables of stone am amen but now it's written in as to be written now in the hearts of men amen amen and now the word of God now must come and it must come into the spirit of God must come into the hearts of men so men will walk out as the Living World amen amen but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the hearts and as such trust have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourself to think anything is of ourself but our sufficiency is of God Amen yes so we not relying upon ourselves that's why he said to Paul my grace is sufficient for thee if we rely upon any good of ourselves we are going to go backwards amen but we have to rely on the perfect work of Jesus Christ am and we got to submit to him we got to surrender to him that he now can dwell in the sanctuaries amen into this Tabernacle of Flesh amen who also had made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirits amen for the letter kill it but the spirit give it life people like to keep going back to the letter amen they like to go back to the written word which is important but it's not good to have just the written word without the spirit yes because the spirit will take the word and make it become projects it through your life amen if you got the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus if that spirit dwelt in you then that spirit makes that word manifested through your life amen that's you become the living Apostles read and known of all men amen at once it was written Apostles but now you have to become the Lively Stones you have to become the the living Apostles amen amenl amen but if the ministration of death written and engraved in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory as to be done away now look at that a chary glory but it was so powerful that Moses had to Veil his face because of the Contin of the glory of God yes how much more powerful it is now when God is dwelling in you and I amen which is it's very easy to believe that God was dwelling in Moses it's easy to believe that God came and manifested himself 2,000 years ago in human flesh but once more Amen in a many member body amen amen he must come again and manifest himself amen because if if it doesn't happen again that Jesus death was in vain amen but I tell you something Jesus death was not in vain God had his purpose God had his great purpose in the back part of his mind amen amen and had to achieve that purpose yes bring back man to his original condition amen amen so you see that how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more do the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory because the law condemned them right but now under righteousness we have no condemnation because we have received the message of our day if you didn't receive the message of our day you are in condemnation but when you receive the message that is given to you in this day there is now therefore no condemnation because when he when he comes down as a Mighty angel in Revelation 10:1 amen he comes down his judgment to the world but he comes down while there's an Earthly Angel Revelation 10:7 and those that will accept the message of the Earthly Angel Revelation 10:7 they now are know not in condemnation because that is pertaining to us which is revelation 108 to1 amen am amen amen for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that excelth for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remain is glorious yes seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and that as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their Minds were blinded for until this day remained the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their hearts nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away amen the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shouts am amen that's the time when the veil shall be taken away amen but those that don't come under this messenger of Malachi 4 those that don't receive the message under Revelation 10:7 the ve is still still there amen amen that's right but we all would open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen so you are also climbing up into this mountain amen into this spirit Mountain into the seven step of perfection amen amen because why you're climbing up to to come and be kept with the edstone amen amen amen because why you are uniting with the headstone amen that's why he said to the prophet I'll meet you in there amen that is not a public show amen that is when you come into a union with him that is Christ and the bride becoming one becoming one unit amen amen and get now Christ coming to dwell in the heart of man amen making it now amen a place where it is now sorry can I take this out are we using this amen so now Christ is now dwelling in the soul amen so we speaking this morning Christ in bright form the word made flesh once more amen amen you believe that amen it's the word made flesh once more yes amen amen there's a purpose why Jesus came 2,000 years ago amen amen that purpose was not to remain a baby in the manger yes that purpose was to bring a people yes as God was in flesh the word was made flesh so there must be a people where the word must be made flesh again amen and that was done as a type in this day in Son of Man Ministry amen but he didn't remain there amen because why God was God had a purpose that was just to show you that that was a type amen you know in everything that you make there must be a prototype amen but from that from that one that is made now they must be IDs that will come forth amen amen and they have been types and types and Shadow all to the Bible but there must be the perfect type amen there must be the end result amen there must be an end result where once again the word must be made flesh amen and now it is Christ in bright form in a many membered body amen amen so we find the word brought by a mighty angel in his day Revelation 101 it can it could only come to revelation 10:7 he couldn't go to any school or seminary he couldn't go to any other religious organization it had to come to a prophet because there's no greater order that the word of the Lord will come through amen God have given could have given it to Angels but this greatest order he said surely the Lord God will do nothing but reveal his secrets to his servants the prophets amen amen Amos 3:7 so it had to come through a prophets and those that will receive this prophet's message amen have the right now oh to become the M piece of God am they have the right now amen to become the ones that have went now that can climb up to the Mount of God where the glory of God can be shown through them amen amen so you find that the glory is shown being shown through this bride now amen but it's still it's you can see it but it's veil to the world Amen so we find that this world has made woman the god of the evil age Satan is the god of the evil age but woman has become their God Amen because they put woman on a ey pedestal yes they always esteem woman highest Amen in everything you see woman is become worshiped yes but there will also be a woman a proper woman amen because everything Satan does is pervert what God had his an original plan there's a woman who be God too amen hallelujah amen they can make woman the god they God but there'll also be a woman who be God because God will be in her amen and it w be us speaking it be God speaking through her it w be her body moving it be God working through her amen because God must work Christ came 2,000 years ago but now he's got a body amen he's got a body that he's using now he's got a body who who is the instrument for him amen who's fulfilling his purpose and our purpose is to fulfill God's mandate amen so this woman is moving and this woman will be God upon the Earth amen amen so if she is God upon the Earth where's The Mercy Seat amen The Mercy Seat has to be dwelling now in a many membered body amen The Mercy Seat of God Amen because why she's grace to the Earth the fact that she's still on the earth the Holy Ghost is still here amen the Holy Ghost will only go when she leaves the Earth the doors when the doors are shut the doors become shut to the Gentile dispensation when the bride leaves the Earth amen but until then the mercy seat is in the bride amen The Mercy Seat is in a many membered body amen can I read that quote he says now is the day of Mercy now let's come back let's go back in the Old Testament here just a little bit and find out what Mercy is go on back and see what happened to the stone the Throne of course is the Judgment seat and the reason today that there is Mercy is because The Mercy Seat is sprinkled with an atonement blood and as long as blood is on the Judgment seat then it is not judgment no more it's Mercy because something died to stay judgment if you see it say Amen as long as blood is on The Mercy Seat show that something died to hold judgment back but when the church is raptured The Mercy Seat becomes a judgment seat amen amen so the fact that the bride is on the earth Mercy seed is still on the earth amen amen amen but when she is raptured The Mercy Seat becomes a judgment seat amen amen so if the bride is carrying the mercies of God what Ministry do we have amen he says God became man he had to become kin folks and he couldn't be God and us sinners creations of his creation creative beings of his creation CA we couldn't be kin folks there so God became man that man might become God Amen yes God's purpose amen amen that man might become God yes amen amen amen we being men Sinners God became a sinner took our sins upon him knowing no sins yet was a sinner because our sins was placed upon him yes he become me that I might become him amen amen he become a sinner that I might become a Son of God hallelujah he become a sinner that you might become a Son of God and now we are Sons and Daughters of God God Amen because God was made kin folks and we and he took on the form of our flesh was born of a woman not another person God himself amen now if we took a form of our flesh then we are taking his form which is the word amen we are coming back to the word image amen amen he took our form so we can come into His form amen do you get that amen so the only way you can do that now is to come into a union with yes 1 Timothy 3:16 said without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh Amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh amen and the word made human being become a Kinsman he become a man oh he become death that through his death I might become life am he become a sinner that through his righteousness I might have become life he become poor that I through his poverty I might be made Rich he become what I was so that so that I might through his grace become what he is amen amen then talk about powers of God now that's exactly the scripture and that's what the scripture says that we might be what love the father shed upon us and shed upon us that we which we Sinners aliens away from God might be draw nigh unto God in so much that we become Sons and Daughters of God not servants the Gentile church is never a servant no sir the Gentile church is Son and Daughter amen you are Sons and Daughters of God who have received the Holy Ghost yes amen amen so you see that therefore you're finding in this hour God now is dwelling in a many membered body if somebody come and tell you God is in a one man then there's something wrong God is Not dwelling in a one man yes yes God has gifts they are gifted men upon the Earth there's men with anointings upon the Earth but God is Not dwelling in one man amen God is now his place his Tabernacle Tabernacle now in the body in the body of Christ which is the mystical body amen she's a Mystic to the world because her life is different she talks about different things she don't follow the traditions of man amen a life she's talking about Heavenly things she's talking about things that out of this world she's a Mystic to the world amen amen she's talking about having a body change amen she's talking about Never Growing Old Amen on the other side of having a new body who doesn't age amen amen she's talking about eternal life she's talking about she's talking about being an amateur God upon the Earth amen she's talking about having Redemptive blessings she's a Mystic to the world Amen she's different from every other human being yes amen so you find that Christ now is in this form so you find God no longer now in Badger skins that was for a period of time amen but in you and I amen the ones that have received the message of the hour yes the one that have received the token amen which is is the Holy Ghost because Lord remember now he can't dwell in you without the Holy Ghost amen it's the Holy Ghost In You amen amen when the Holy Ghost comes in you then God can use you when the Holy Ghost comes in you then God can fulfill his purpose amen God can't fulfill his purpose without his Spirit In You amen so you got to surrender yourself to him yes you got to yield yourself to him you got to submit to him amen that you can you have to you have to come to the realization that you was placed on the earth for a purpose oh yes amen that your body was meant to be the Tabernacle of God yes amen you are the Temple of the most high amen and if you are the temple of God then in you lies the mercy seats the mercies of God Amen that is staying judgment amen because right now judgment full Judgment of God could come upon the Earth but what is staying judgment you are on the earth yes and therefore we living in hour God allowed in this hour where hell is Unleashed on the earth amen God had to allow that why did God allow it in this hour because he knew that he's going to have an invincible Army in this hour he knew that he'll have a people amen he wants to show Satan The Showdown he want to show Satan I got a people that will believe my words that will accept my words amen that will live by my words yes and they I have become them to th000 years ago that they may become me amen yes Lord I did the Kinsman work for them I have redeemed them I have restored them I have restored them how when the message of the hour comes Amen to restore at all things amen amen he brought the unadulterated word in his hour am that will chop out every denominational ISM out amen and he can bring a people back to the pure word amen and bring them back take them out of traditions of man and bring them back to the pure word Lord amen he said so I have become them I took their place so that they can become me amen they can be the mouthpiece for me amen because my spirit is upon them amen my spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in him that same spirit is going to Quicken their mortal bodies amen amen you might see that is why God in you if the gene of God is in you and you wor but I'm stepped in this pest house that pest house is going to change that pest is going to be delivered amen that's the final part of the adoption in to amen where that body is going to be transformed that body is going to change from Mortal to immortality from corruption to incorruption amen yes L thank you Lord amen no other age could do it but in this day in this age when the full word has come down amen amen when the title lead has come back in the hands of the rightful owner amen title Le that to come back when when there are to be a people on the Earth when there are to be a prophet on the earth amen yes and this Prophet this people will receive this prophet and when they receive the prophet that is the Gateway amen amen that's the gateway to receive the title deed amen amen that's why John couldn't worship him because he said I am like your fellow brother and the prophet because why John was typing the bride amen and what he were seeing the prophet who brought the message of the hour Amen to come to a people amen because title deed has been restored in this hour amen that's why the prophet could go and preach up to Revelation 10 1-7 and left out each part the other part out because the other part has to be spoken by the M piece of God in this hour the one that become where the messenger and the message becomes one the one that has come receive the message of the day amen and the one had to say where they become the final voice they are the right now to take that scripture and say thou must prophesy again Hallelujah because why it's revealed to them amen the title de has been revealed to them the names in the book have been revealed to them the full Plan of Redemption has been restored back to them amen amen so God has taken what is done the stone that was word which was the word written on the stone and put in the ark behind bad of skin because that was that what was what was written the stone it was the word of God but it was in written form but it was written in stone amen now it was also put behind Bader skin not human skin yes amen but your heart amen inside of our heart it changed that's why you to say he took our Stony art and given us the heartart of Flesh amen because first you had to do transformation of that he had to change take our the the the way we thought the way we think about things the way we were uh because we are born under Flesh and Blood Amen in flesh and we are born out of sin amen come into the world speaking lives but you to CH change our heart of Flesh of stone to make it a heart of Flesh amen where we can receive him amen so behind your flesh and the spirit ministering there we find that God when when comes down there now he's be able to bring his word in us and we can say Amen to that word amen you might be thinking I'm just a normal person in the church I'm not a preacher I'm not in the fivefold ministry there was a sister called etes amen amen who could amen that word amen amen and then she could have whatsoever she desired because she had the right she created the right atmosphere in the house and she could receive that word and she could amen that word Hallelujah so when you receive that word when the world is rejecting the word when Jesus Christ is rejected once again who is Jesus the word amen rejected once again and when he's rejected once again you are receiving that word hallelujah but once again when you are are presenting yourself as the ambassador of Jesus Christ don't think you'll be accepted because you must take up your cross and follow him amen if Jesus was rejected so must you be rejected if you can to have everyone being very nice your family is being nice to you your friends being nice to you then there's something wrong if they don't see something different about your life yeah if they don't take you if they don't see I don't I don't mean that you're a mean person what I mean is if they don't see that you took a stand for the word amen because watch the difference watch the demons then when you take a stand for the word right yeah what the people that you think are your friends what the people that you think you are are your families watch when you take a stand for the truth then you'll see the other side that's right then when you have to have discernment and see demon Spirits dwelling in man just like our God is dwelling now in a many membered body demon Spirits are also dwelling in man yeah amen and the same demons that were in the people that rejected Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago must and the same ones that rejected the word when the prophet was preaching it did everything they could to to come against the prophets even the 400 ministers Tred to come against the ministry and all these things when you're coming against the word and all the hardship that his Prophet had to go through right that he took get in the end and we know what really happened there but we know that the word had to come forth nothing can stop the word from coming forth amen it was there preserved amen for a people amen and when his word has come forth it wasn't just a normal word it was a word that come with sweat amen with Blood Sweat and Tears amen a word that's come with Blood Sweat and Tears and we cannot be now in our comfort zones accepting this word this is not an ordinary word amen this is the word that is where God is saying now I become you amen I've taken your place right a thousand years ago I done the work of redemption for you that you can become me you have a purpose amen don't sh from your responsibility your responsibility is to be my body upon the Earth amen amen amen so if you are my body on the earth The Works that I did must you do also John 1412 huj and Greater Works than this ye shall do amen because now it can be done in more in a more measurable way because why it's in a many membered body just like the time when Moses got tired and his father-in-law said you know what you man one man can't do this alone you tie yourself out and then Moses had to transfer the gift to 70 other men so just like that it's just not a greater gift than Moses but just that more people now using the gift so just like that more people now taking out the works of Christ amen so the same works you have to measure the spirit amen The Same Spirit that was in Christ is dwelling in you that he must do the same works if that same spirit that was there in the apostles and he wrote book of Acts then this bride of Christ must write another book of Acts amen amen amen so you find that this is the hour where God must have man and woman on the earth where they will have dominion again amen all that they lost they must have dominion again it must be seen CH in flesh again amen you can't see yourself as an ordinary person amen you know we've got our sisters that dress up in a way that the world don't dress up they wear their hair the the world doesn't do it but if you sisters thinking is just done out of tradition or just to say no I want to be a holy person then there's something wrong but if you got a revelation of why you do it amen that you have show that you are a daughter of God that your values are different from the values of the earth if you got a revelation of that then that becomes a testimony that becomes a living apostal great know of all men and your men that conduct yourself differently is showing that we are different people on the Earth amen amen amen you have to recognize that you are the word of the hour amen that you are the word made flesh in this hour am you got to recognize your part of the scripture Jesus could walk in perfect faith when he took his part and he saw himself in the scripture and took the scriptures that pertain to himself William Brandon did the same thing the prophet of God took the scripture that pertained to him and saw himself in the word amen you can fulfill that by seeing yourself in the scripture and when you see yourself in the word you pray back God the word amen amen amen did Moses do that he take took God back to his own word when God wanted to told when God was W was so angry with the people of what they have done making this cough and so forth he wanted to destroy them and Moses is reminding god of the promises he made yes to Abraham Isaac amen and Jacob amen amen he's taking God back to his word amen so if you want anything on God take God back to his word amen God is obligated to his word amen he's not obligated to your feelings your emotions he's obligated to his word therefore you find that you know sometimes you get sometime you go and pray for you got a situation where you got financial problems or you got sickness upon you the first thing you do you want sympathy but take it to the word amen get your emotions out of the way yes sir amen that's right take the word amen leave your emotions your emotions can't help you what's done is done you are in a situation now you are in a crisis tion is your emotions is going to make the situation worse amen amen your your senses are your five senses and all the things that you feel taste smell he all is going to make it worse amen take the word of God Amen take the promises of God because it is yay and amen amen the promises of God can never fail it's the same yesterday today and forever am amen so we find that our life must be a sign amen when you're telling the people the people might misunderstand you don't be don't be faced by that tell them who you are that you are a son and daughter of God [Music] Amen tell them in the hour because you know for too long you're telling the people I'm just going to church I'm just a Christian I'm just going to church and they know you as a Christian tell them who you are that you a son and da daughter of God Amen that you have received a message in this day that will give you rapturing Faith amen that you received a word that come through a prophet according to the scripture sir amen and this word makes me different amen amen because why what makes you now rewrite the book of Acts because you come through the Water Way straight is the gates s t r a i g s r s t r a i t amen straights not the other straight G h t but AIT straight which is the Waterway amen yeah and you come through the Waterway to the true baptism when Jesus said go into all the world preaching the gospel baptize them in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost watch The Water Way in the book of Acts 238 is opening up repent every one of you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen amen so you come that way that unlocks now the book of Acts to you amen amen and when you come the right way receiving the message of the hour then it unlocks the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost can come now and work in your life yes the Holy Ghost is locked up don't let the people think tell you they got the Holy Ghost they got the gifts of the Spirit but the Holy Ghost himself amen they can't receive the Holy Ghost nobody has the Holy Ghost outside the message of the hour amen don't let the people come and tell you I'm born again I got the Holy Ghost yeah no one has the Holy Ghost goes outside the message of the hour amen amen because they didn't come on the right way amen so all the people out there they claim to have the Holy Ghost do not have the Holy Ghost it's only the ones where God is manifested now in human flesh yes Christ in bright form hall because she is carrying the Holy Ghost she was the one who said be unto me according to Thy word amen she was the Virgin bride amen amen she was the chosen one the predestinated one amen when she received an angel's message she received it yes she didn't question it yes hallelujah amen when she received the angel message she received it amen amen but then she didn't remain in that condition just receiving the word no the Holy Ghost had to overshadow her yes amen and then she had to come to a time of conception when she received it but from the conception she went on a journey she went on a 9 month Journey amen amen until the time she had to give birth to the Holy One amen so now what was hidden name there all these years is no longer hidden it's now being manifested amen so when you receive this word all the years it was hidden you were receiving and receiving the mechanics oh but it's the hour of the Dynamics amen amen this is the hour of the Dynamics it cannot be hidden anymore because why it was in seed form you received it but now in Fruit form amen it has to be shown forth that's right amen that is why now is the time you must prophesy again amen there was a time you received but now is a time where it's being manifested amen amen so we find that look at some scripture John 114 says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us the word that we received yeah it's easy to take that scripture and pointed back 2,000 years ago and the Word was made flesh but it is easy to receive that the word now that you received in this hour is made flesh you receive the word in this day is it made flesh amen yeah do you see yourself as that word that you received is now flesh amen or do you see your brother and sister you say no that brother I know him from there he's here oh do you see that's the word made flesh do you see Jehovah walking in two feets amen do you you see that oh do you see no that's my sister with all her faults that's my brother with all his faults it's time you look beyond that it's time you look beyond the flesh amen and you see that what the quote I just read that he become your he took your son that you can become him amen oh yes so that you can become God on the earth amen so that's your brother and sister God on the earth the word made flesh in this hour Ephesians 5:27 say that he might present it to himself amen a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle that's right or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish how can it be holy when it's because his holy ghost is in dwelling in you amen the holy God in a people so it's the act of the Holy Ghost that wrote the book of Acts the the acts of the Holy Ghost in the people amen the acts of the Holy Ghost In You amen Christ speaking through you Christ working through you Christ Healing The Sick through you amen Revelation 197 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready amen because why Matthew 25 what what what Matthew 25 says the ones that went to take the lamp that that oil in the lamp amen 25 says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened un 10 virgins which took the Lambs and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were wise took their lambs and took no oil with them but we but the wise took oil in their lambs with their sorry in their vessels with their lambs while the bridegroom tered they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom come go you out to meet him and all those virgins arose and Trimm their lambs and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our Lambs are gone out but this wise the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut so you see those that would go and be one with him Unite with him amen so right now although there was an invisible Union taking place it was invisible the world didn't see it but what becomes visible about it is the manifestation of the Union amen yes if there was a union taking place when we received the word the the the union between Christ and his bride the bride and the bridegroom it was an invisible Union but there must be a manifestation of what took place if the union had to have a conception and it had to reproduce Jesus Christ again so there must be a manifestation at one stage it was Private it was a private Union it was in invisible it was invisible to the world but what took place behind closed doors must be shown now in the open amen when this bride is fully manifesting Jesus Christ upon the Earth there must be an hour where she fully manifest Christ cuz she had the oil in the lamp amen she had an over overflow of oil which is the Holy Ghost that's right and if she got an overflow of the Holy Ghost it must be known amen it must be seen must be manifested amen because the very works that Jesus did you must do amen he come to reproduce himself that's what he come to do he has to reproduce himself again amen yes amen amen now that's what the invisible Union was about to come under a union and the others wouldn't come into Union with him so the prophet of God always say she is him in bright form amen the word made manifest in her she is a continuation of Christ Ministry on Earth just as Christ was veiled in human flesh the bride is veiled in human vessels but in his life it is his life his spirit and his word expressing itself themselves through her amen not your spirit his Spirit now you are submitting to him you are saying I die to Christ I I must die so that Christ can live in me amen you die to self you die to that old nature amen yes you become a prisoner of Christ so his life his spirit and his word must Express itself through you amen yes amen amen amen Ephesians 5:30 says for we are members of his body of his flesh of his bones amen the bride is not separate from Christ she is him in another form he just changed this form amen she's not a separate because that is why for you to become bride firstly the gene of God had to be in you amen amen you had to have representation when you receive the message there to be a deep calling to the Deep yes amen so we find that you are just it's just Christ in a different form now Christ was manifested in the son of man in in the days of William brandham that's good to show that but now it's hard for people to see now Christ is manifested in a different form which is the bright form it's easy to talk about any other Ministry but when it comes to the time when Christ is manifested in you then the responsibility comes upon you now there is a responsibility because it takes a consecrated life amen as I said the prophet had to go through tears to blood to sweat to bring this message forth now for Christ to be manifested you it's going to take the same thing it's going to take a consecrated life you can't be the same as the world yes yes God is calling us to be separate from the world it's not hard to be enticed it's very easy to be enticed by the world because sin is appetizing sin is waiting at the door but we got to he to the Holy Spirit we got to resist the devil amen we got to walk and stay under the covering of the word amen the minute we step out of the word and Satan got the right to take advantage of us but we must come back to the word hallelujah that is why a son and daughter of God can't stay and remain in a sinful condition yeah a son and daughter of God you don't have to keep telling him come back he must come back amen amen just as Eve was taken out of Adam the bride is taken from Christ sharing is nature and life we are partakers of this divine nature didn't Peter say that we are made partakers of this divine nature Amen in the Old Testament the word was veiled in the Tabernacle in Jesus day the world was veiled in human body but today the word the word is veiled in the brde yes amen 2 Corinthians 318 says but we all would open fa is beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from Glory unto glory amen amen so as we are receiving the word which is coming through the fivefold ministry that same word that we are eating of we are changing from Glory unto Glory your journey cannot remain stagnant there has to be a progression in your walk amen that word that we receive is changing us from Glory unto Glory that one of these days oh brother oh my dear sister one of these days that wretched body of yours amen oh that wretched body that one that's causing all the problem right now the greatest enemy that we have that's going to be delivered that's going to be changed that's what the B say we the Redemption of our bodies thank you Lord amen thank you Lord and therefore you are here right now you are changing into his image and you are reflecting back is glory amen as the word is unveiling Earth amen so must reflect back his body his glory sorry you must reflect back his glory that's why when when when God when Moses met with God and the glory of God shown upon because it was God in Moses amen Moses became God to the people and therefore when the people looked at him they could see the glory of God shining through him so when the people see you they must see the glory of God shining through you the must you that you're not an ordinary person and if you are a son and daughter of God you will take a side you'll take Sid with the word of Jesus you won't take sides with the world you'll take sides with the word amen so you find that in this hour the bride is making herself ready a dawn in the righteousness of the Saints amen because why we are the word living itself out that's why we can over when you are living the word out you overcome every deception of the enemy in this last days amen yes because why you stand on the unchanging word of God you have to manifest The Life of Christ by living a Victorious holy life amen and the token has to be applied because as you receive the Holy Spirit what is the holy spirit is the literal Life of Christ should carry the token which is the literal Life of Christ amen displaying the evidence of his resurrection hallelu because what is showing for the little you have to come into a union you have you have conception now the little Life of Christ is being show forth through you amen so in this last day amen this is the bride Christ in bright form amen amen hallelujah you want to see Jesus again it's Christ in bright form the word made flesh once more amen so don't think of yourself as an ordinary person don't think yourself think of yourself as just a church goer because then you will be following the traditions of man God God called us out of traditions amen he's come to break us out of traditions he's come to show you that you a son and daughter of God Amen he's come to show you that you are God on the earth he's come to show you that you are the vessel that is chosen in his honor in his power to be vessels of Honor amen vessels that he can manifest himself upon the Earth Christ must be displayed once again through this many membered body amen time is gone I have this quote that I never read but we pray that you got the message amen you caught the glimpse of the message this morning that Christ now in bright form the word made flesh once again bless you let's stand [Applause] amen you appreciate the word of the Lord amen amen let's give the Lord a good ank of Praise amen that was tremendous amen hallelujah amen that was the mystery being revealed amen the Christ ultimate expression is through his body amen hallelujah now amen let's make that personal now how many of us want to see that us coming to the image of Jesus then there's got to move from now the teaching the preaching to the application and that's going to be a daily surrender to say Lord make me more like you amen I want to be more and more like Jesus amen I want to be more and more like him amen so notice every time the word is made flesh the glory is put on display amen how many if you noticed that in in both scriptures the brother was reading every time the word is made flesh the word Glory Appears amen you notice that amen if you looked at St John 1:14 there the word was made flesh and immediately talks about glory in 2 Corinthians 3:18 it's talking about coming into his image and immediately the word Glory Appears am amen and what was the theme for this year we will share in his glory and the only way we can share in his glory is to come into the image h amen so amen thank you brother Joshua amen we were tremendously blessed with the word of God Amen let's sing and glorify his name he's worthy to be praised
