is he back in church and we praying for them as well hallelujah amen amen so god will give us a victory in manchester united continue to be faithful to the lord serve the lord and god will give us the victory amen god will give us the breakthrough amen says to victory sister maggie got the flu this morning so they're not here this morning we pray that the lord will bless them and give them a healing amen also brother jeffords is the kin experiencing headaches amen so we pray the lord will touch them amen and deliver them from their headaches but we're glad they can come into the house of the lord to hear the word of the lord this morning amen let's jump to our bibles this morning hallelujah i'm if you know every day with jesus is sweeter than the day before hallelujah amen let's turn to our bibles in the book of uh ephesians amen amen we'll speak this morning on the love covenant between mr and mrs jesus christ the love covenant between mr and mrs jesus christ amen ephesians 2 and 4 says but god who is rich in mercy amen for his great love wherewith he loved us hallelujah now there's no ordinary love the bible says great love wherewith he loved us and you know there's a connecting scripture that says greater love at no man than he that would lay down his life amen we see adam in the garden of eden now he laid down he was prepared to lay down his life for eve and he was locking up a secret about god's great love for us so for his great love wherewith he loved us and he didn't love us when we were perfect yes he didn't love us when we were polished up born again filled with the holy ghost let's read why we loved us even when we were dead in sin and quickened us together with christ by grace are he saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus the bride is not seated alone the bride is seated with a bright groom amen listen to 1 john 4 16 amen 1 john 4 16 hallelujah amen thank god for his greatness and his mercy amen yes amen 1 john 4 16 amen and we have known and believed the love that god had to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him amen [Music] hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world so we are god's representative here in the world right there there is no fear in love but perfect love casted out fear because fear had torment here that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say i have loved god and hated his brother he is a liar for he had not loved his brother whom he had seen how can he love god whom he had not seen and this commandment have we from him that he will love with god love his brother also now who is our brother is it just us in the message let's turn quickly brother caleb to genesis 4 9. now this you cannot dispute because we know that cain and abel did not come from the same father amen right but look at how god is addressing cain and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother amen is king serpent seed but god is saying where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper and again the lord is saying what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood cried unto me from the earth yes amen why all life comes from god is the giver of all life amen hallelujah so when we are projecting love it's not to be selective yes amen we are to love all men amen because even though the book of redemption is open to us and the seven seals are open to us how many of you have the lamb's book of life to see every name that's on the book amen we don't so we gotta preach the gospel and spread the gospel myth amen god add blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so we're looking at the left covenant between mr and mrs jesus christ notice they are a married couple mr and mrs jesus christ now the bible is written on words the prophet says but the bible is a love story to the church amen the bible is a love story in fact it is the greatest love story brother brandon goes on to say love in his great bosom went out to adam's fallen race and redeemed them through his son christ jesus amen now he says that a covenant is a strange thing amen when we make a covenant with one another in our modern day we shake hands amen that's a covenant then he goes on to explain that in the eastern orients how they institute when they made a covenant they killed a beast and they split the beast open and they stood between the dead beast and they wrote out their covenant i hereby say a certain certain thing then they take this agreement and they tear it into two pieces one piece is given to one man and the other piece is given to another man i know you're thinking about the chinese laundry man right now but this is brother brandon is giving us another illustration right he's talking about how you kill a beast and in the midst of the blood you ride out the covenant you tear it you give one to one man and you keep the other part so he says they take an oath over this dead beast to say let my body be as this dead beast if i don't keep this covenant now god was then in spirit how could god tear the spirit apart he couldn't but one day god was made flesh and dwelt amongst us amen the lord jesus christ emmanuel and then there calvary the covenant wrote with us amen with jesus own blood he took christ to calvary and tore him apart soul and body and he took his body and set it at the right hand of his majesty and sent the spirit on the earth to make a covenant to carry out the gospel amen so he goes on to say here that he's the same yesterday today and forever and the church is given a covenant and that covenant he says is the baptism of the holy ghost which is the seed of abraham bringing to us and god is making this covenant that every man that's called into the grace of god by the holy ghost amen we are called into this message by the grace of god through the holy spirit amen sometimes we wonder i don't know why jesus loved me i don't know how my lord god chose me but i'm thankful anyway but i'm only in this message by grace amen it's not him that willeth or him that runeth but it's god that showed mercy amen then he says amen you can have a piece of paper that just impersonates it so you can have a portion of that paper a portion of the holy spirit to impersonate the holy spirit that's what he's trying to convey but he says the same spirit that was on jesus christ has come back on his church doing the same signs the same wonders the same holy ghost the same power it's the covenant that god has given to them and jesus died in the evening time when the sun was going down confirming this covenant and the holy ghost is on the church tonight leading the church just like he did when he was here he was leading christ the same way the same ministry christ had is in his church tonight when jesus christ was on the earth the holy ghost could not be split into many member bodies the holy ghost tabernacled jesus alone he was the fullness of the goddess bodily amen there was none of the disciples that could receive the holy ghost when jesus was around and jesus commissioned him when he was going away stop preaching go to the upper room but for now stop preaching get to the upper room until you endure with power from one eye amen hallelujah sometimes that's what we need to do get away with god amen amen that's what we are searching after we in the backside of the desert and we know without a shadow of a doubt that no scoffer can shake us away from present-day truth and present-day reality [Music] amen hallelujah what is it it's our time it's true time amen they are just displaying what's on the inside of them amen hallelujah amen is lamb trimming time what are they doing when they are saying about the cloud about the pillar of fire they are telling you i have no oil in my lamp [Music] amen how do you see that give me some of your oil not so amen go to smiley joel and go to tv snakes amen and buy from them amen hallelujah amen so he says here in 113 now watch what how the devil tries to got the pentecostal people he says pentecostal people don't you see that you these others can't believe in that there's nothing in them to believe with but the trouble of it you've got it i want to say this morning message people you've got it amen and don't know it if the devil if you can't get it he can hide it from you and let not let you know you've got it he's got you licked [Music] see you can't fail hello you cannot fail jesus christ took of your care of your sins past present and future hallelujah did you hear what is here there's nothing you can do that can separate you from the love of god because jesus knew you your end your beginning to your end and he took care of the sin question amen as long as we have faith in the lord jesus christ you believe in his blood amen that cleanses us from our sin you keep walking with god amen hallelujah there's no way of failing you're abraham's seed god is sworn with an oath he takes you in there you are he's made his covenant hallelujah jesus christ he's his covenant he tore him apart at calvary received the body up and sent the holy ghost and when the resurrection come the same spirit that was in jesus christ is the only thing that will raise the body up to go to meet that one there that makes them husband and wife you see what i mean the bride is a covenant people unconditionally yes amen you are the only people that carry a a man like abraham one man alone in his generation had a covenant he had i will covenant you are the only people in this age that carries a covenant it's a love covenant amen you may say it's a blood covenant the love covenant made a way for the blood covenant amen the bride is a covenant people unconditionally god called you out of the world gave you the holy ghost the seed of abraham you are tonight with a blessed promise that if you are abraham's seed you have this promise in you you believe god regardless what takes place the holy ghost makes you believe it anyhow the spirit was upon christ is upon the church because there's the bride and the groom a little while and the world me no more yet you shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world the spirit and the body is taken up now he says if that same spirit that was in christ has to be new or it won't compare with this covenant he says aren't you happy tonight that you're baptized into the church of the first born of the living god that the very spirit that was in in christ is in the church tonight and you are a part of it by the holy ghost being dead in christ take on abraham's seed and that is according to the promise he says what are you scared about all devils in hell couldn't shake you nothing can shake you we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken now there's a difference between covenant love covenant love is what a person experiences as he enters into a relationship with god we call it in our human way of saying it unconditional love but it is god's covenant love there's a difference between a contract and a relationship amen there's a difference between a contract and a covenant a contract is a mutually beneficial relationship while a covenant is something you fulfill a contract is legally binding amen that's what the law was god's contract with man it was legally binding if you disobeyed what was in the contract you were doomed you could experience the wrath of god but aren't you glad for the love covenant the grace covenant amen so a contract exchanges one good for another while a covenant is giving oneself to the other so even in a marriage contract we don't focus too much on the marriage certificate itself even though some of us study day and night looking for the expiration date amen when love projects amen it overtakes every contract even if you're sad you know because of business and things like this people sign a what they call it lawyers help me what do they sign the lawyers don't want to help me a prenuptial what's it called anti-nuptial contract hey an anti-nuptial contract i think that's why they named themselves a and c they do not serve the people but a and c what is that that is not in it yes you sign it for the legal purposes but the law the love covenant in your relationship overrides every contract you are not focused and take this contract to your wife every time she displeases you look here missus what we signed how many of us do that we don't concentrate on the living law but love projects through that relationship amen when god is speaking to his prophet and he's blasting these denominational people for rejecting the word that is not directed to you his bride because you have not rejected him you have opened up the door amen and you have opened up and you have received his word into your heart amen what kind of a marriage will it be if the husband is constantly rebuking his wife amen oh we're gonna get lots of amens now what kind of a marriage will it be if the wife is constantly bickering nagging but love covers a multitude of sin amen amen even though the wife is terribly angry with you because she asked you to do something three weeks ago but she still makes your favorite meal she still treats you kind she still loves you amen even though when you fight she reminds you of what you did five years ago amen but love covers a multitude of sin amen the strength to hold on to your part of the promise get divorced amen let's start the song of solomon chapter 8 and verse 6. chapter 8 and verse 6 says set me as a strong heart now some of us may be able to understand that we know how strong death can be right he says love is as strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the calls thereof are called the fire which has a most vehement flame many waters cannot quench love neither can floods drown it if a man would give all his substance of his house for love it will be utterly content amen now god's covenant towards us is love covenant we know that in ephesians if we go to ephesians chapter 5 amen let's go there quickly ephesians chapter 5 as we take off in our sermon now amen ephesians chapter 5 he's telling us that christ is the head of the church right we know all of that we want to get to verse 25 he says husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious shirt not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so are meant to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever hated his own flesh but nourish it and cherished it even as the lord of the church amen now when a young man and a young girl a young couple they fall in love with one another there is a mutual attraction they fall in love with one another amen they begin to get to know one another more amen the prophet says their hearts start to beat as one amen i know some of you going back in memory like trying to go back and remember that feeling you want to sing that song when i remember amen they fall in love their hearts beat as one they want to know more about one another amen but they're not husband and wife yet but their love binds them together they have confidence in one another now if they really have confidence in one another you have faith in one another then they get married if you didn't have confidence in one another you'd better not marry her so very important you must have confidence in the woman that you are marrying you gotta have faith in her and here he says in the message perfect faith you can separate them put one extreme south one extreme north but that's still the love beats for one another no matter where they're at they're just as true to one another as they can be because they love one another and if you love the lord just not trying to dodge hell but you love the lord then you have faith in god amen so here's this young couple they meet one another the circumstances doesn't seem conducive for them to meet amen this is a man who is ready to get married and his father is looking for a bride for him now he owns a ranch and he owns oil wells he's a rich wealthy man he owned the kettle on a thousand heels amen his riches are unmeasurable immeasurable amen but they came one day to this little ranch and he came looking for a wife for his son now all the girls in the ranch got excited because this man came all the churches got excited amen they want you to attract the attention of this young man so they dressed up in their western outfits now you would know how the western outfits were amen you you women will probably know better this thing was nice and like whoa what they call it ballroom gowns they had the best designer clothes made amen but there was in this ranch a little cousin and she was an orphan she just done all the work for these other girls because they had to have their fingernails fixed and they didn't want to wash the dishes so she did the real hard work there's only one wife in this end time one woman who's doing the real true commission doing the real hard work the rest are in it further amen and finally when the sun came they went out and got an old western way shooting guns and carrying on and that night they had a great big dance this went on for two or three days then one night the boy stepped out of the place he went to rest a while from the dance from all the noise of the worship and this one girl kind of ragged looking she had a dish pan full of water she washed the dishes and he said i i don't think i've seen this girl before and he wonder where she comes from so he he tries to make his way towards her he sneaks out the back way and he gets down to where she was she was barefooted she stopped she held her head down she seen who it was and she was very shy she knew this great person and she was just the cousin to these other girls their father was the foreman on this big armor outfit she kept looking down she was ashamed of being barefooted he said what's your name she told him says why aren't you why ain't you out there where the rest of them and she kind of made excuses so the next night he watched fuller again god is watching your character amen god's not looking for flirters god's looking for real what you're carrying on everything amen he says i find a character in you that they don't have amen god don't waste time when he finds a character amen he asked the question amen all the young guys are paying attention here otherwise you're too slow you're what brother john smith brother branham he says i didn't know who brother branham was i went straight up to the father and i spoke to him and i asked him what they say you snooze you lose he says i find character in you that they don't have will you marry me she said i can't think of such a thing me said yes i couldn't find one in chicago i want a real life i want your wife with my character and the thing that i'm looking for i see it in you i'll get you and take you away from you you won't have to work like this no more i'll take you i'll go to chicago i'll build your home like you've never seen sounds familiar say john 14. she said i never had a home i'm a orphan he said i'll build your home a real one i'll be back now listen what he says he kept in track with him when did jesus make the promise before his ascension how did he keep in interact with us through seven messengers each one giving a word of warning to her and vanishing up amen it says he kept in track with her during the time a year she worked everything that she could saved enough money so what's his faith expressed if she really believed that he was coming back for her she had to get ready and herself it's ready and you know when she just played the wedding garment a cousin said why you poor silly kid you mean to think a man like that would have anything to do with you she said but he promised me that's where the church is standing this morning but he promised me he's coming back amen he promised me i believe his word oh it's just making a fool of you there's no literal coming of the lord jesus christ [Music] others believe that they have another gospel the seven pillars you must have heard about the seven pillars that you need to take strategic positions on the earth because when god sets up his kingdom on the earth you must have an influence over governments over the in the medical field in every high ranking field christians must go and study and become great intellectual people in the world so then when christ come back you can rule and reign with him sure if he'd have got somebody he would have got one of us with our fine polish buildings he will take us that's what looking for it amen people are not looking forward to it amen the apostle paul says looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of our lord and savior jesus christ what are you looking for amen are you looking for your name looking for and that will be preparing for the coming of our great and amen our great king who loves us he says so kept getting later and later the day finally arrived certain hour he was to beer so she dressed in a garment and that's where the bride don't like it amen why are you wearing your so hi look at seeds of discrepancy the invisible union of the bride amen the rapture things that are to be what kind of garment is this you don't have anything like seven steps we got it it's called statue of a perfect man but i don't like that one that one is not telling me any money better for them we got seven steps as well but they don't want it amen so she's dressed in the wedding clothes got things ready but they really did laugh there the girls heard nothing about it so it just was all mysterious thing to them can you see what he's saying he says it's a mysterious thing to them but this girl just in the face of all of it upon the basis of his word that he would be back for her they got you laughing they put their hands around one another and dancing you know poor little silly kid she just stood there not a bit of blush in her she was holding her flowers are you holding your flowers you got your bouquet you got your wedding dress on you got your bouquet now some of you are visually imagining this and it sounds laughable to you as well that the bride is dressed in the garments of the world for transportation [Music] the driver is not late wait the first part of she didn't listen to them i got five more minutes he'll be here or they just laughed and about the time the old clock ticked up to five minutes they heard the horses galloping amen amen stand rolling under the wheels the old bug board stopped the party stopped she jumped from between there amen out the door she went amen and she jumped out of the carriage and flew into his eyes go home the prophet says i know of another great promise like that i've gone to prepare a place for you coming back to receive he's saying now this time ticks away into eternity there i can almost see the angel standing there with his hands raised to the heavens amen shall be of these days be taken to the father's house let us think of these things as we go along now amen hallelujah now we said wouldn't jesus take one of these fine churches polish programs he goes on to say here if you're the right kind of husband and jesus is the right kind of aspirin he says there is no woman in the world you would love like your wife now these are love secrets that the lord is whispering to us this morning we're talking for the brand maybe referencing a natural love between a man and a woman but it's a spiritual meaning there's no woman in the world that he loves like you there might be other women might be fairer they might be prettier and so forth if you really love your wife there's something in there you don't notice what she looks like you love her you don't know why but you love her and women that you know something in you you know you love them well that's the same thing it is about faith you know it's going to happen that's not a shadow no matter how many would say contrary you still believe the same thing because that's genuine real faith amen now when we're talking about the love covenant between mister and this is jesus christ now any love want to have fellowship you can't keep them apart so the caleb don't look like you don't understand what i'm saying you know what it was like hey you didn't worry about your friends anymore all you knew was when she calls me [Music] do you know the feeling i'm talking about in love do you know that's divine love it's one of god's attributes that you are expressing on the earth god placed that love there [Music] amen they want to have fellowship your friends are complaining you don't spend time with us anymore but now when you watch your friend the same friend who's complaining when he meet someone nobody like him okay he forgot about his friends and you waiting there now you're saying even if i'm a lone ranger i'll arrange alone but wait till you see her that one amen all the talk will be forgotten he says before now they want to have fellowship but before they can enter into any contract there's got to be an agreement to the fellowship and it's based upon their pledges to each other they enter into a lifelong fellowship but before they can enter into a friendship there has to be an agreement first so he said all of that to say this when fellowship was broken between god and man there had to be some sort of agreement some sort of arrangement to restore again that lost fellowship and god found the plan it was through the blood of an innocent victim that god restored man back to fellowship with him again amen there have been many substitutes tried you'll find them in religions today they are called substitutes adam tried it we've tried to educate people we've tried all different forms but there's nothing that brings man back into fellowship with his maker but the blood of his son jesus christ it's the only appropriation god has is his blood an innocent victim died for a guilty person that brought fellowship back to god and man then adam covered by his blood could stand in the presence of god and worship again he says there's something about it when you speak of blood blood is life without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin you can have everything in the world you can have any kind of thing you always wish to any object to worship any creed amen to live by but you can never come into fellowship divine fellowship with god until you first come under the blood that's god's holy and ordained provided way for human beings to fellowship with him through the blood of his son the lord jesus christ that was his plan it's still god's plan it will forever be god's plan amen no other plan but through the shedding of blood amen so people have lost sight of god's plan and he says that's what's the matter with some families around here and everywhere else we think we can roll the sea of life without jesus without being in god's plan he says but you'll find out there'll be trouble in the little bark before you get too far you can't stem the tides of life without christ young people establish this in your heart you can never go through life without jesus christ make it the central theme of your life the first thing in the morning the last thing in the night amen he says put you out somewhere and give you some disease or sickness or your backslid something like that but remember he planned the rampance of glory sitting on high his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me amen believe me if god affection he said to you this love covenant he's got his eye on you nothing can harm you amen without him knowing about it satan may want to test you satan may want to try you but he's got to ask god permission first he is from everlasting to everlasting god he steps up and he watches you he sees where you're at he knows we're having this meeting he knows how concerned each one of us about it he knows your interest in him he knows your interest in the kingdom he knows where your heart is so he watches over his word it says you don't know what a heritage you have we're talking about this word of god the message of the hour we don't know what an heritage we have he says protect this protect it don't let anything keep amen amen now are we in love with jesus do we keep in love with jesus let's see how brother branham brings it down to test if you are really jesus he says now in this [Music] so let me give you context he was talking about the children of israel and they were complaining about the manna they wanted the garlics of egypt right they didn't value their present day message so now he's saying in the modern day it would be the complaints would be oh every wednesday night prayer meeting every sunday morning back to the church what do we hear the same thing the preachers stand up and preach songs go on back see then you're just going as a line of duty you're not a worshipper let's not beat around the bush some of us are not worshipers yet you serve god in your own terms when it's convenient for you can you hear the horses coming you can hear the horses coming but you don't want to come into the house of the lord to worship him the horse is going to ride right past you you're gonna run after the chariot you're gonna be singing swing low speed chariot that shout it's not gonna swing low for nobody house of correction checking up time i'm tired you tired you think jesus wasn't tired on the cross after carrying the cross when chapter gold gathers here being crucified you're a pen pusher at work doing admin work doing light work not even a construction worker [Music] a worshiper goes there to worship to express himself i don't want to express myself let's all stand up let's all raise our hands a worshiper goes there to worship to express himself before his god to praise god for his goodness to every word he hangs on to it just like a love affair if you're going with a girl because you knew it was a duty or going with a boy when you were young mama wants me to go with this guy but i just can't stand it how many of you like to be in a relationship like that your mother is forcing you to let this girl or your mother is forcing the boy or the girl to like this boy that's how he is equating it when you don't want to come into the house of the lord your mother is forcing you and bringing you to church your father forcing you bringing you to church your husband forcing you and bringing you to church he says you don't get nothing of him coming to see you in fact you don't want to clean up so even when she comes around you don't want to clean yourself because you're not interested you don't want to go see her why it's a horrible thing and when he's coming to see you you just wish he would hurry on go home that's the same way it is when why does he preach so long what about all the stuff and everything see you're not in love when you really hang on to every word as the spirit gave you warning this morning that might be what he's been talking to you about holding on it's eternal life to every word of god it says to go to lord can somebody say a man this morning then you're in love with christ you love to go well honey sunday morning again and get got to get down with them and leave the people they don't bore you why they're your brothers and sisters amen you get a sticker short gun molasses on a cold morning you don't run it just stays together clings tight right he says you stick together the colder it gets the tighter they stick and that's the way it ought to be with us when earthly friends forsaken still more closely to him clean and what we love it's not because we're somebody but christ in one another that we love you see it's the god in our beings that we love we love to come together right so you can read now we know that part of the third pull was in an unknown language you remember he says one part went off in an unknown language but love is an unknown language remember he said it won't be a public show right if we read first corinthians 13 and 1 i i'm going to read it because i know if i tell you to go read it at home some of the younger people won't go and read it at home so while they in church and i got the attention i speak with tons of men and angels some speak for tons of devils some got their own unknown language but he says though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not love i am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol though i have gift of prophecy and i understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains that sounds like the bride right that has the ability to do all of this and have not love i am nothing though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor even charitable words now and though i give my body to be burned and martyred and have not love your prophet did me nothing what is love love suffered long is kind love envied not love wanted not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly secret not our own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoice it not in iniquity but rejoice it in the truth bear with all things believeth all things hope at all things endure with all things love never fail it where there be prophecies they shall fail where there be tongues they will seize where they be knowledge it will vanish away but we know that love will never fail that's the definition of true love and that's the love covenant between mr and this is jesus christ what is he doing lovers husbands and wives young boys and young girls when they have an attraction to each other they have an unknown language they have a love language you must have heard about the language of love some of you know you know your wife give you that one look you know exactly what she means it's the love language but did she say anything it's an unknown language yeah he says now so we know nobody else knows what this love secret is but he says god's great mystery what the eternal god had as a mystery has now been unfolded in jesus christ given down to his church what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ jesus making love to the church his bride whispering secrets to her when you whisper to somebody nobody else can hear if they can hear you then you're not whispering he is whispering love secrets to you it's a whisper amen remember particle third pool not a public show he's whispering love secrets to you he's telling you that you are a hidden mystery locked up in the back part of god's mind he's telling you just as how eve was taken out of adam's side you were taken out of the side of the lord jesus christ and he's telling you that even as i am in the father the father in me i in you and you in me [Music] you see you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets get up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is that's what god christ is doing to the church he is letting her know the secrets marriage and divorce who is this malteser letting you know the secrets just the secrets not the flutters i mean his wife knows by having the revelation of his secret made known to them by his grace how is the sikh revelation of his secret made known by his grace how the grace of god now let's close with this god requires our response to his love covenant right he says if god when i was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he has seen something in me god seen something in you he has a reason to save you look at the people that's unsafe today look at the millions you could have took beside you but he took you the prophet says amen can you say amen he took you no one can take your place in god's economy no one can do it that is love to you no one can take your place you're in god's economy no one can do it that's love god's love covenant then won't you love write reach won't you love reach right back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is it's circumstances by this love that creates faith that god loves you and you love god mister and this is jesus christ in a love relationship amen you love one another and that brings the faith it can't keep from bringing out just exactly what god promised he would do perfect faith is pure just as perfect love is now when you love somebody you love your husband or you love your wife now there's no need of anybody telling you you don't because you do you know you do it how can you prove you do it i prove it by the way i live to him i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal honest husband and that proves to me that i love my wife and i love my husband your life proves what you are the same thing christianity does your faith you have confidence in one another it's pure it's something real you can't show it to somebody else yet you've got it your actions prove it when you got pure unadulterated faith like your love is to your companion then you prove it by the way you act you ain't complaining no more you know it's done just walk around no matter what the thing looks like what anybody else says you know what's happened you know that it's finished just as well as you know you love your husband and as well as you know you love love and faith has to go together they kin folks love produces faith so in closing what did we learn there is a love covenant between mr and mrs jesus christ some people only see the law part of the message the written contract the do's and the don'ts but the love covenant will make you follow all of that because you're not doing it because of the law you're doing it because you love jesus christ you follow everything he says because you love jesus christ that's your response back to god for his love to you and i now when we can accept that love covenant it says that love will produce faith you understand where we're going with this we are looking for rapturing faith is a hidden mystery that love produces faith it's a hidden mystery people are wondering how will i get rapturing faith brother branham says love produces faith so check your relationship with god this morning are
