Greetings in the mighty, the all powerful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Let's give our Lord and Savior a wonderful clap of praise. [applause and cheering] Amen. He is victorious. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to Amen. our Bible. Then we can be seated. Let's go to Luke 18:8. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I just want to read from the second part there. Amen. And it says, "Nevertheless, when the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God's not looking for how well we are dressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. How religious we are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The thing that moves God is faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wednesday, we were telling you, you can't pray to God and ask him for money because there's no money in heaven. &gt;&gt; Faith is the currency of heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Amen. So when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is faith enough in heaven, &gt;&gt; but he wants to find that kind of faith on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What kind of faith? Let's go to Mark 11:23. See the kind of faith that God is requiring in this time and season. &gt;&gt; Now, this is one level of faith. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mark 11:3 is 111. one level of faith. It says, "For verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, &gt;&gt; but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this is the kind of faith to remove things. Everybody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mark 11:23 is a faith to remove things. &gt;&gt; Remove every circumstance. &gt;&gt; Remove every doubt. &gt;&gt; Remove every fear. &gt;&gt; But this bride doesn't move with one level of faith only to remove things. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Romans chapter 4. We'll go to verse 17. There [clears throat] &gt;&gt; we've got power to also bring things on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only remove obstacles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 4:17, it says, "As it is written," talking about Abraham, "I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed." Who does he believe? God. &gt;&gt; Now, who quickened the dead? Somebody say God. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Now, he's talking, most people think that Abraham, this is talking about Abraham. This verse actually moves on to God now. So even God who quicken the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's the level of our faith. We call things which are not as though they were. &gt;&gt; Abraham was operating with this kind of faith as well. &gt;&gt; He started to call things which were not as though they were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he was GOING TO KILL ISAAC on the mountain, he said, "I and the lad shall return." &gt;&gt; Amen. He started to call it before it happened. &gt;&gt; So we have a ministry not just to speak things out of existence. We have a ministry to call things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord had blessings reading up. We're speaking this morning the world of perfect faith. How to operate in a world of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A word of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Are we living in a world of perfect faith? God's not going to ask you how many years you were in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's not going to ask you if you wore long dresses, &gt;&gt; even though those things are required. &gt;&gt; God's not going to ask you if you paid your tithes. &gt;&gt; God's looking for faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's looking for a people who are living in a world of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; And Christ has done it all. &gt;&gt; Because he says, while we were dead in our sins, Christ raised us up to be seated together with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In heavenly places. Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we are looking for a perfecting kind of faith. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a mustard seed faith. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a small level of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. After the opening of the word and after the prophetic gift has come, after the title deed of redemption to the earth has come, God is requiring a higher level of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we ALL KNOW THAT HOW DOES FAITH COME? Faith cometh. &gt;&gt; IT'S A CONTINUAL COMING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Cometh by the hearing. As you hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by the hearing. Hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. M &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the kind of faith THAT WE ARE TO BE generating because we are a faith generator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we hear the word of God, it's generating faith within us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And are we a 100 rand faith generator, thousand rand faith generator, million rand generator, &gt;&gt; or we a billion rand generator? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Because we generate faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; By what we are hearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now that he HAS UNFOLDED THE ENTIRE PLAN OF GOD, REVEALED ALL THE MYSTERIES of God, revealed the hidden mysteries in the back part of God's mind, and released to us back the spoken word. This ought TO BE THE GOD KIND of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the kind of faith we are looking for is Galatians 2:20. Now as you are writing the scriptures, you ought to be referencing the scriptures daily in your life because we are not operating on our own faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is no longer I that liveth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am crucified with Christ. &gt;&gt; So don't come looking for gan died. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Don't be so proud of our earthly names. Earthly names and earthly lineages carry curses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Earthly names and earthly lineages carry problems. &gt;&gt; Earthly names and earthly lineages through your bloodline can carry problems. &gt;&gt; BUT THE BIBLE IS DECLARING THAT I &gt;&gt; SAY I &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; AM CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST. &gt;&gt; So you can't find the old me &gt;&gt; because I'm a new creation &gt;&gt; and I'm A BRAND NEW MAN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS ARE PASSED AWAY. &gt;&gt; AND I'M BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO DON'T BE SO PROUD TO TELL people about that old man &gt;&gt; and what he did. YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE MAN AND WHAT HE DID. &gt;&gt; That old man was subject TO THE LAWS OF THE FLESH &gt;&gt; TO THE LAW OF sin &gt;&gt; to the curse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN CHRIST DIED, I DIED WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE AROSE, I ALSO AROSE WITH HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THE LIFE I NOW LIVE, LET'S HEAR WHAT THE APOSTLE PAUL IS SAYING. I am crucified with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So show me Naidu. &gt;&gt; Show me Moody. &gt;&gt; Show me Chatty. Show me Mir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then you're projecting flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know in our family, we're very proud of our name. No, you're projecting flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You ought to be proud of the family name. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT ALL heaven is named after. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; NOW I CAN ASCRIBE BLESSINGS TO THIS NAME. &gt;&gt; Now if I ONLY FOCUS ON AN EARTHLY NAME, WITH THE EARTHLY name I said comes all manners of sicknesses, diseases, problems and all of these kind of things. &gt;&gt; But with the heavenly name, &gt;&gt; I am summoning heaven. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY DO WE HAVE THOUGHTS ON THE EARTH? They are patterning an heavenly &gt;&gt; PATTERN BECAUSE IN THE COURTS OF HEAVEN, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD. &gt;&gt; IT WAS DETERMINED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, LORD. &gt;&gt; Why do you think Romans 8 starts out like that? Put Romans 8:1. What do you think Romans 8:1 starts out about? &gt;&gt; That there was an accuser who was accusing us. &gt;&gt; But Romans 8:1 says, THERE'S NOW THE THE KING MAKING JUDGMENT IN THE COURTS OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NOW. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, NO CONDEMNATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO THEM WHICH ARE IN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; Who walk NOT AFTER THE FLESH, THE FIVE SENSES, BUT after the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, IN THE COURTS OF HEAVEN, IT WAS DETERMINED YOU ARE NOT GUILTY. &gt;&gt; In the courts of heaven, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT YOU ARE BLAMELESS, &gt;&gt; THAT YOU ARE SPOTLESS, &gt;&gt; THAT YOU ARE WITHOUT WRINKLE. &gt;&gt; In the courts of heaven, IT WAS DETERMINED that you can't carry faith in your flesh. &gt;&gt; So where do we carry this billionaire faith? &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that in your soul &gt;&gt; there's two &gt;&gt; either faith or doubt. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in the realm of doubt is where the worries come, the anxiety comes, the anxiousness comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all those kind of things. So if we're operating in that, we are operating in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. But in the realm of the spirit, it says it's faith. We walk not after the flesh. &gt;&gt; So where do we carry this billionaire faith &gt;&gt; in our souls? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many faith billionaires are here? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Faith billionaires. &gt;&gt; Faith billionaires can call things from the unseen realm into the seen realm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith billionaires. If you want to be a national millionaire, billionaire, &gt;&gt; you first need to be a faith billionaire. &gt;&gt; You first got to operate in the things of God. &gt;&gt; You first got to make God show see that you are trustworthy. &gt;&gt; How many of you know if in the realm of finances, how many of you know if you want to understand what God can trust you with? &gt;&gt; How many of you know what what level God can trust you with? We work in South Africa here. We work in the realm of rents. &gt;&gt; In God's eyes, do you know how much he can trust you with? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you want me to tell you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But look at what you earning. &gt;&gt; That's how much God can trust you with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone understand? &gt;&gt; At this current level, that's all God can trust you with. Now, when he gives you that, we've got to know how to apply it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, God is look in the kingdom of God, God is a businessman. In the kingdom, when Jesus is giving his parables, he's looking for ROA or ROI, return on investment. He's looking that whatever he's given you, there's there's in numerous stories in the Bible that when he comes back, he's looking for return on investment. &gt;&gt; It's there in Matthew 25. &gt;&gt; He's there when he's talking about how he he he this king, Amen, uh uh left out his vineyard or his husbandry, amen, to people and then he even sent servants and they killed the servants. Then he sent his son, they killed the sons, then he went himself. &gt;&gt; He was looking for return on investment. Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Now, God wants to multiply and grow whatever he has given you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God wants to bless you exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ask or think. &gt;&gt; So, in the stewardship he's given you, he needs you to invest it wisely back into the things of God. That's why he's got Luke 6:38 there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't receive what you don't give. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we also got to be careful in how we handle the things of God. And do you know people are so consumed with voices? &gt;&gt; Voices &gt;&gt; they can't determine which is the spirit of God speaking to them. &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of God is speaking to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is giving us instruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's telling us, you know what? You are my disciple. You are my steward, my leg on the earth, my feet on the earth. I need you to go and do this for this brother. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because people are praying to God in heaven thinking that their out is going to come from heaven but God is going to steward his people on the earth his hands and his feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we shut out these voices and when we shut out these voices we are cutting off our blessing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Part of stewardship is also knowing how to receive. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we find in the early years of the prophet's ministry, I love the prophet because he's very honest. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In the early years of the prophet's ministry, he didn't understand how to receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until he got into problems with his ministry in terms of finances and he wanted to leave the field because he said to the Lord, "If I ever can't pay the bills, I'll leave quit the ministry." &gt;&gt; He was putting unnecessary pressure. &gt;&gt; Now, if people are only reading the first part of the ministry and the first part of the sports, they'll only attach to that and they'll look down upon giving. But then the Lord tells him the people need to have a part in the meeting. &gt;&gt; You're cutting off their supply and their blessing as well. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; yes, the Bible does say it is better to give than to receive. &gt;&gt; But receiving is also important &gt;&gt; because yeah, I I I can't remember the exact quote right now, but the prophet of God says a man came to him and wanted to give him an offering and he said no. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then he said, "But brother, you are robbing me of my blessing. But you're not receiving what I am giving to you. You are robbing me of my blessing. &gt;&gt; Then the prophet says, "Oh, I never swear that way." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So Luke 6:38 says, "What does he start out with? &gt;&gt; Take, &gt;&gt; take, &gt;&gt; take, &gt;&gt; receive." &gt;&gt; Sorry, &gt;&gt; some of you choking the sh. Come on now. [laughter] &gt;&gt; What does he say? &gt;&gt; Give &gt;&gt; and then it will be given you. &gt;&gt; Now the promise of God can never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Give &gt;&gt; it shall be given you &gt;&gt; good measure. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, Sister Kim loves this kind of message because she came out now. You see the jump with you in trouble. She's going to ask today. It shall be given to you good measure. My father don't give half measure. &gt;&gt; My father gives good measure. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know when you're packing a suitcase, money is light. &gt;&gt; It can rise very quickly. So he presses it down. &gt;&gt; You reading with me? &gt;&gt; Press it down, &gt;&gt; shaken together, &gt;&gt; and running over shall give to you. &gt;&gt; Come on. Who blessed Abraham? Go read the Bible carefully. Wherever whichever country people were you went to &gt;&gt; they started to bless him with cattle with things and all of that &gt;&gt; shall who give to you &gt;&gt; men &gt;&gt; men give into your bosom &gt;&gt; now we are of the understanding that we are employed by a boss &gt;&gt; and that our source if we are I'm trying to shift your understanding this morning that if we are thinking that our source comes from the company we work from we are sorry mistaken &gt;&gt; what your company identified is that you possess a certain skill, &gt;&gt; a certain talent. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So they are buying your service, &gt;&gt; you don't work for them. &gt;&gt; They make it seem like you work for them. But what they are really doing is paying you for your service, for your skill, for your understanding, which came from where? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Let's break it down further. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You think you got that skill and understanding by yourself? &gt;&gt; Who gave you the knowledge to learn? &gt;&gt; Who gave you the ability? who gave you the good health. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE REALLY TRACE IT BACK, OUR SOURCE IS &gt;&gt; ABA. &gt;&gt; OUR SOURCE IS GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because he gave me the breath of life. &gt;&gt; Who is Moses Corporation? &gt;&gt; Who is Renault? &gt;&gt; They're not my source. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God used his men &gt;&gt; to give into your bosom. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we shift mindsets? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, you are not governed by the contract you sign. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They wrote there, we'll consider an increase after 3 years. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can approach the courts of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You've got a higher power and a higher source. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Someone's not believing me yet. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I don't see everyone connecting here this morning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got a higher power and a higher source. &gt;&gt; You're not governed by local contracts written by men. &gt;&gt; I was sharing on Wednesday in the ranking of the spirit realm, it's God. Highest authority. &gt;&gt; Highest authority. Lowest authority is who? &gt;&gt; The men of the earth. &gt;&gt; Unsaved. &gt;&gt; They possess no rank, no authority. Demon powers possess more rank than them. That's why they possess them. &gt;&gt; Everyone understanding? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the highest is God. The lowest is the unsaved man, fallen man. &gt;&gt; Above fallen man is demon powers. Above demon powers is angelic beings &gt;&gt; and above angelic beings are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You go read what the prophet of God says. HE SAYS WHO IS MORE POWERFUL, an angel or a son of God. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT YOU'RE A SON OF GOD? A DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; So the kind of faith we are looking for was found Amen. In Galatians, I don't know why we went off in this direction. I wasn't going to go off in this tangent. We're talking about faith, the world of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [crying] &gt;&gt; It says Galatians 2:20, I have been crucified with Christ. So, you can't find the old me. Nevertheless, I live, but not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now this kind of faith that we are talking about I just want to read what the prophet of God is saying here. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you love the prophet of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] So he says here in the in the message perfect faith he's talking about Jesus right? Jesus had faith with his power. Remember last week we took this word power and we determined that in the Greek it's authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND EARTH IS GIVEN to me. &gt;&gt; He had faith with his power. &gt;&gt; Now the authority has been put into the people but what we are looking for the people to come INTO AND RAISE UP INTO FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO OPERATE THE AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; He said we read the scripture Wednesday too St. John 5:19. I can do nothing in myself. Why? He relied upon what he was. This is the crux of today's message. And so pay attention now. How did Jesus have faith? &gt;&gt; He relied on what &gt;&gt; he was. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, rely on what you want. &gt;&gt; Okay? Say it after me. rely &gt;&gt; on what God made you to be. &gt;&gt; What God made you to be &gt;&gt; that now puts you into another realm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what the problem with message people is? Message people believe everything written about Moses. They believe everything written about Elijah. They believe everything written about the prophets. &gt;&gt; They believe everything written about William Branom. Some have spent maybe their life's work to study and analyze the ministry of this great prophetic ministry. It's their life's work. 40 years they've spent trying to analyze how did God use this man in such a mighty way. &gt;&gt; But when it comes to understanding what God said about you, &gt;&gt; what God made you, &gt;&gt; people are poor in faith with that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [crying] He relied on what he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. [crying] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He relied in knowing that he was the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we the word made fresh? Now &gt;&gt; we must rely that we are the word now. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; He has faith in God who made him the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have faith in that God made us the word for this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was God the word and they was in him and that gave him faith because he understood his [snorts] &gt;&gt; what gave him faith. Please walk with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; It's a very simple message this morning. &gt;&gt; He understood his position. Yes. &gt;&gt; So understanding our position gives us a certain kind of faith. &gt;&gt; Understanding who we ARE WILL GIVE US UNSHAKABLE FAITH. &gt;&gt; He know what he was because the scripture had said he was this. &gt;&gt; So we have got to know what the scripture says concerning us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then our faith becomes unshakable. And here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if we've never operated in this level of faith or understanding, it's time we go and we study what the scriptures say about us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What the scriptures say concerning us. &gt;&gt; You see, we need to be like Simeon. Simeon wasn't like &gt;&gt; Simeon. I'm talking about Simeon in the Bible now who was waiting at the temple for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Do you know no prophet prophesied about it? &gt;&gt; There was nothing in the Bible that he could show the people. I'm waiting here according to this promise. It says the Holy Ghost revealed to Simeon, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; that he must stand in the temple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sons of God are led by the &gt;&gt; spirit of God. &gt;&gt; So he's going to reveal things in the word and we are also going to be led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this present time and season, &gt;&gt; amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knowed what he was because the scripture said he was this. And here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be. And he knew what he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we know what we are? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we know who we are? &gt;&gt; Do we know who lives in us? Do we know what faith operates in us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we also have to have the scriptural backing. &gt;&gt; So go and make this your study for the week. Write down every scripture that pertains to you. Write down every verse that pertains to you. &gt;&gt; That becomes what the word says about you &gt;&gt; that positions you &gt;&gt; that releases to you a certain faith because faith cometh by the hearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will receive a certain kind of a faith understanding the prophetic ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes. But when you if you want TO UNLOCK A GREATER level of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wednesday I was talking about Joseph. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know there are levels of faith and circumstances that can restrict at what level you operate at? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When he was in his father's house, he couldn't operate in the gifting and the anointing that was locked up in Joseph. Yes, &gt;&gt; IT WAS SUPPRESSED BECAUSE HE WAS A SPOILED BOY. &gt;&gt; YEAH, &gt;&gt; they didn't require him to do anything. &gt;&gt; He wasn't even allowed to go with his brothers to take care of the sheep &gt;&gt; and the cattle. But God would now create circumstances and opportunities to position him in part of his house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in part of his house, HE COULD ONLY UNLEASH A CERTAIN level of his ability and whatever anointing he had within him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. He couldn't unleash his full potential in part of his house. &gt;&gt; When they put him in the prison, it unlocked another level and a dimension of faith within him of anointing within him. But he couldn't unleash his full potential. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But when he was raised out of that prison, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; and put there at THE RIGHT HAND OF PHARAOH, &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND he was TOLD THAT, AMEN. YOUR WORD WILL BE &gt;&gt; SOUNDING THROUGHOUT ALL KINGDOMS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And there's no one's WORD ABOVE YOURS EXCEPT MINE. &gt;&gt; THEN JOSEPH COULD NOW UNLEASH HIS FULL POTENTIAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE HAD CONTROL OVER EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You go read Genesis 47. Joseph had control over everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They first came to Joseph and they tell Joseph, "We have need of grain." He says, "Well, you can buy it." When money failed and all their money was gone, they said, "Well, what good? Our money is now gone and now we're going to perish." She said, "Joseph, we can't hide from you. &gt;&gt; You've got to present yourself to God's provided way. &gt;&gt; God's provided way in this time and season is you and I." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every demon power must come subject to you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you go and read Genesis 47. Every single person came subject to Joseph. &gt;&gt; All things were under his feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Last week, Sunday we were talking about that that all things have been put under our feet. &gt;&gt; They even told Joseph, you know what? What good is our lives? Let us sell our lives to you. &gt;&gt; They sold their lands to him. They sold their cattle to him. And they said, we will become your servant. But Joseph now who is positioned there for the prosperity of the people. People people get nervous when you use the word prosperity. Do you know what the word prosperity means? to thrive. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To thrive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I need that's that is why John in one one John there the apostle Paul is apostle John is saying beloved I wish that above all things that you would prosper &gt;&gt; and be in health even as your &gt;&gt; so your soul must thrive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your soul must have abundance of what? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We just detailed a while ago that in the soul resides what? Faith. &gt;&gt; So in your soul, YOU MUST BE VERY PROSPEROUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF FAITH IN YOUR SOUL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because what did we where did we determine the container that's storing this faith that's generated? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the soul. &gt;&gt; Did we find the scripture? &gt;&gt; Amen. Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul. &gt;&gt; So soul prosperity means there's an abundance of faith being generated in your soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When somebody is saying even as meaning that the first two things depends on that last thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everybody understand that? &gt;&gt; The first two are conditional based on the prosperity of the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I would say this that the level of your prosperity in your health and prosper in all things depends on what kind of status you have in your soul in terms of faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If your bank balance in your faith realm in your soul is zero. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're going to have zero prosperity in all things &gt;&gt; and zero prosperity in your health. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says, "Even as your soul prospers, even as you gain this abundance of faith, even as you come into perfect faith, &gt;&gt; I want you to prosper in all things." Now, please don't put limitations on all. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, "Stop being an unbeliever." Come on. I want you to tell them &gt;&gt; not only on your left, sister. Tell them on your right. Everyone left and right. &gt;&gt; Some of you are afraid because you know the negativity is on this side here. So, you only go where you know the problem is. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Nobody's talking to Caleb yet. You told Hey, &gt;&gt; come on now. The problem is not in heaven. &gt;&gt; Where's the problem? &gt;&gt; The problem is on the earth. &gt;&gt; And the problem is sitting I won't tell you which side of you. &gt;&gt; It could be left, right, or inside. Right? So I won't tell you which side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet of God now is saying, how far did we get down that boat, brother? &gt;&gt; So we determined that there's another level of faith unleashed to us when we know who we are and what the word says about us. How many of you will go and make it your week's uh lesson to go and write down all the scriptures that pertain to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. because that's going to unleash another level of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh let's go to 65. &gt;&gt; 65. &gt;&gt; Therefore, if he relying on it upon what God had made him and if he did that, then why can't we rely on what God made us as believers? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why can't we rely on that? &gt;&gt; Amen. These signs shall follow them that believe. He had faith in what he was. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if you as a believer, you have faith in what you are. You are a believer. And if you've got faith in God, the Bible says it over in here. You see what you need to do? Know the scriptural reference. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's trying to tell you, you've got to know the word. &gt;&gt; What the word says about you. Then you go put that authority &gt;&gt; on the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Brandham says vision is not above the word. &gt;&gt; Gifts are not above the word. &gt;&gt; He says if a vision or something tells you contrary to the word he says you leave that and you stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you've got to have he says pay attention to this because message people are the most illiterate when it comes to knowing the scriptures. They know quotes. They know quotes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They can tell you quote, page number, this, that, paragraph, everything. But when it comes to the word, the written word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They'll say, you know, somewhere it's written over there. Where? Somewhere. Tell me the scripture. Quote me the scripture. Because here he's telling you, if you've got faith in God, the Bible says over in, and he puts that dot dot dot. He wants you to fill in the blank. Let's move on brother. If our hearts condemn us there, it brings another element now right. People can't operate. You know, we exclude oursel from things and blessings of God. We say, "Oh, brother, you know, I'm not right, so I can't come to church. &gt;&gt; You're operating on your own strength." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If we could ever do anything for ourselves, then Jesus didn't need to come. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, bro, things are not right. I think I'll just stay at home until things come right. Hey, you got another quartet. You better than he ever knew because you feel you can operate our own power and make things right within yourselves. &gt;&gt; Jesus already made things right for you. &gt;&gt; You need to submit to his plan, to his purpose, to his will and everything. &gt;&gt; He has made all things new. &gt;&gt; He has made all things right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If our hearts condemn us, then we can't have faith. But if our hearts don't condemn us, then we have faith. If we have confidence towards God, then you see, brother Brandon knows the scripture too. If you want to find, read that. It's found in St. John 3:21. I've got the scripture written down there. Notice, I mean, it's 1 John 3:21. If our hearts condemn us not, we have confidence towards God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But as long as you're doing things that's wrong, &gt;&gt; you can't have confidence towards God. &gt;&gt; You'll automatically know you're wrong. Now, that that uh prick in your heart to know that you're wrong is a good thing. &gt;&gt; It shows that your conscience has not been seared with a hot iron. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And you can still come under conviction of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The thing to do there is repent. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Repent means to turn away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll automatically know you're wrong. You're automatically putting yourself back there as a sinner by knowing that you're wrong. &gt;&gt; But when your heart down don't condemn you. You know you're a believer. There's nothing between you and God. You can ask what you will and know that it'll be given. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's the word that's given to you just like it was to those disciples. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what the Bram is. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what Moses is. &gt;&gt; Come on. Have faith in somebody else. &gt;&gt; But then why we are so affected by what other people do? You know they hurt me so bad over there. I can't go there. &gt;&gt; They hurt my feelings. &gt;&gt; So that person you got you had you know they you know I put so much confidence in them. How many of you heard people talk like that? &gt;&gt; I put my trust in them. &gt;&gt; Who told you to put your trust in man? &gt;&gt; Who told you to PUT YOUR TRUST IN SOME PASTOR? WHO TOLD YOU TO PUT YOUR TRUST IN SOME DEACON? WHO TOLD YOU TO put your trust IN ANYONE? PUT YOUR TRUST IN the Lord. &gt;&gt; TRUST IN THE LORD with all your heart. &gt;&gt; So many people stop going to church because they associate their hurt feelings now to that person to this world. That's why I can't go there. You're operating on the wrong level straight away. It says here, &gt;&gt; the only thing you have to do is have faith in what you are, &gt;&gt; not what the next person did, &gt;&gt; have faith in what the word says you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus had faith in the word of God that said he it is written of me. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, WHEN WE COME WITH THIS KIND OF UNDERSTANDING, &gt;&gt; LO, I COME IN THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "LO, I COME IN THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK." &gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE YOU TO REVELATION 10 AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK CAME DOWN TO THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK WAS PUT INTO MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK, YOU WERE GIVEN AN INVITATION TO COME AND EAT THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; Consume the book. &gt;&gt; So the volume OF THE BOOK IS WHERE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. So when YOU COME BEFORE A SITUATION, BEFORE YOUR LIFE PROBLEMS, YOU CAN SAY, "LO, I COME IN THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK. IT IS WRITTEN OF ME." [cheering] &gt;&gt; LORD, [applause] thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him. I am the bread of life that came from God out of heaven. I [clears throat] am the tree of life. I am all these. I am that I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know God is still I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you know why I am is manifesting right now? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what Christ the mystery OF GOD IS ALL ABOUT. &gt;&gt; I AM IS STILL BEING MANIFESTED. THAT'S WHY HE NEVER ATTACHED A NAME TO I AM. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because now I am is in a many MEMBERED BODY. &gt;&gt; I AM THAT I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah. Messiah means Christ. anointed one &gt;&gt; that the spirit of God was upon him. Now he said now I in myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in &gt;&gt; you. &gt;&gt; Somebody say me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It made it's made manifest for you a believer and a believer is the faith of God that moves in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not operating with human faith. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; It says the faith of God is moving in you. &gt;&gt; So allow the faith of God to HAVE EXPRESSION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALLOW THE FAITH OF GOD TO HAVE EXPRESSION. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's move. Amen. You like that. &gt;&gt; How many of you like that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, I like when you like it. Amen. I like teaching of where, how, to, what faith really is. &gt;&gt; So stop studying about every other person and start studying what the scripture says about you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's going to release your faith. &gt;&gt; What faith is that? God's faith in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's faith working through you. &gt;&gt; Knowing who he was without a shadow of a doubt. He knew he was the son of God. He knew it. For the word identified, the word of God identified who he was. He said, "If I do not the works of my father, then don't believe me. If I don't do them works, don't believe me. But if I do, then believe the works for they are the manifested pro word promised. Or if you could just wake up to that those sleeping just wake up. The prophet is trying to call you here. &gt;&gt; Some of you say you don't speak through the books and TJ is calling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, if you could just wake up to that a minute." You see the word itself identified who he was. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Who can condemn me of sin? Now, if you take Romans 8:1, you can also say, "Who can condemn me of sin?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:1 said, "There's thou therefore no condemnation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We read that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you can stand with that same scriptural authority. WHO CAN CONDEMN ME OF SIN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Not everyone's believing that. WHO CAN CONDEMN ME OF SIN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN OTHER WORDS, who can show that my life and my works don't fulfill exactly what the Messiah should do? Now, this is where we got a problem, right? This is where we got a problem because he's saying the works and his life fulfill exactly what Messiah should do. Now, we got a problem here because the prophet of the hour said detailed what the bride would be. Should be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Should be a super church. should be a super race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we seem to have a problem because the works and the life are not matching. &gt;&gt; So we need some spiritual diagnostics. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To identify the problem &gt;&gt; and do a service and a fix. &gt;&gt; And that's what the service is about this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; How to operate in that perfect faith. Know what the word SAYS ABOUT YOU. KNOW YOUR SCRIPTURES. Know what it says about you. &gt;&gt; Allow the faith of God to move in you. Then you'll see super church, super race. You'll see invincible army &gt;&gt; because it's not based upon the bride's EARTHLY MINISTRY. IT'S GOD WORKING THROUGH THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; Nobody could say nothing for he was. Then he had faith to believe then whatever he said it would happen. How many of you want to rise to that level of faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; That you can't do nothing but what God speaks through you. that whatever you say happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; But that's the WORLD OF PERFECT FAITH WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; That's heavenly places. &gt;&gt; I want to when I speak I I WANT TO HAVE SUCH CONFIDENCE. I WANT IT TO HAPPEN THEN AND THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he turned around and said, "The works that I do shall you do also." &gt;&gt; You watch Brother through this port now. He's contrasting Jesus and he's bringing it back to you. Jesus. And he's bringing it back to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the head and the body are one. Last week's sermon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Head and body are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The works that I do shall you do also. A little while and the world seeth me no more. Yet you shall see me. Yet you shall because I'll be with you even in you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Take no thought what you shall see. For it's not you that speak, it's thy father that dwelleth in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one who does the speaking and it's not me. It's the father that dwelleth in me. He doeth the work. See what I mean? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next one. Amen. He says, "Could you compare Christian today with them Christians of long ago? how the disciples walked in the power of the spirit, moved by the Holy Ghost, just a prisoner, as I preached the other night, a prisoner to the word and will of God. He couldn't even move until God moved him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you like to see a church rise like that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to. &gt;&gt; It's got to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's on the road now, I believe. &gt;&gt; Yes. For the word identify himself, what he was, and the same word identifies us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If a man loves me, he keeps my commandments. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's go to 76. Then if you abide in me and my word abide in you, so the word must be in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You abide in me, my word abide in you. Then ask what you will. He knew who he was. Therefore, he had faith. Faith can produce when he know what he was. Now, if you abide in me and my word abide in you, then you know who you are. Ask what you will. It'll be given you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. The prophet of God in the next part now as I'm speaking this, I want you to be able to confess this. Watch what he's saying now and watch how the spirit is moving because right now things are going to shift in your life. Something tells me that tonight's the end of your suffering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's ending right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you're going to do it. You'll go away here with something. Some of you, you're going away from here with something. &gt;&gt; You are not going away from here with nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter how much you come in emotion, how much you do that it won't work. SO DON'T COME AND CRY TEARS. HEAVEN IS NOT MOVED. THE COURTS OF HEAVEN ARE NOT MOVED BY TEARS. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's moved BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; FOR SOME of you that don't know, right now it's 11:23 &gt;&gt; right now. And that's why I say watch how the spirit is working to bring this in to watch. It's not moved by tears. It won't work until that perfect faith has manifested and identified itself in you &gt;&gt; as substance. Then nothing's going to shake you from it. Speak right now. Every sickness has to go. Every disease has to go. Every problem has to leave right now. But don't only speak out of existence. Speak into existence according to Romans 4:17. You call those things which are not as though they are. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. He says here if you had cancer the doctor told you you'd be dead before Monday morning your heart your respiration gone cancer's eating you up bloodstream become completely cancer something come with the substance of this genuine faith perfect faith was made substance in you'd say [laughter] &gt;&gt; where you going to laugh &gt;&gt; hey I'm looking for some John Ryan here &gt;&gt; who's got doctor's ointment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to go home and practice to laugh &gt;&gt; because you need to know how to laugh in his face now. &gt;&gt; What he says you'll do &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; in the car when you go back in the car? &gt;&gt; You laugh in his face. Were you giving a testimony last week, brother Amish? You're going for what test? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you call those things which are not as though they are. You said all test will come back clear. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And his test results came back clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen. How many of you here as a testimony were prayed for or you believed and had faith when you went to the doctor all your test results came clear? Stand up or raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Let me see. &gt;&gt; Raise them high. I want the people who don't see the witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you went for the test results, all came back clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says you must laugh in the doctor's face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what else? You can laugh at your zero bank balance. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Faith is a principle. It's a law. &gt;&gt; You can, &gt;&gt; come on, people of God. &gt;&gt; The same faith you have for Rafa, you must have for &gt;&gt; Gyra. &gt;&gt; So if you can laugh at sickness, &gt;&gt; you can laugh at zero bank balance. &gt;&gt; Because when you see it there, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; you must be dyslexic. You must see numbers that you can't that's not even there. &gt;&gt; That's how faith operates. &gt;&gt; You must be able to see numbers that's not even there. &gt;&gt; You must be able to see sales that's not even there. &gt;&gt; You must be able to see people coming to support your business that's not even there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you know people are buying stuff? &gt;&gt; So you are going to summon the courts of heaven that they must now buy from you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE BUYING STUFF. YEAH, &gt;&gt; they're buying it all everywhere. &gt;&gt; We are going to pray uncommon favor now &gt;&gt; that they all directed to you. &gt;&gt; What you need to do? Be able to handle the capacity. &gt;&gt; Don't pray for stuff and you can't handle it now. You're fumbling the oil. You're in a way. No, if you're asking God for something then otherwise what he's going to do release little by little until you can handle it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So that's why preparation for what you are asking is very important. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are praying the Lord, expand my business, expand my business, and you're there in a one uh small office over there, but you need a factory maybe &gt;&gt; to handle what God's going to give you. You know, Jabas, when he asked the Lord &gt;&gt; in 1 Chronicles chapter 4, he had the capacity to handle what he was asking God for. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Enlarge my borders, enlarge my territory," he wasn't asking God just for fancy. He knew that he had the potential to handle it. You see when is when I was asking here and I was actually going to say this but brother Sunonny confirmed it to me outside when I asked whoa wants to be a millionaire only brother Sunonny raised his hand and my next words going to follow I said I know what you're going to do with that million brother Sunonny but as soon as I stepped out there he told me what he confirmed it &gt;&gt; he said I want the million to give it back to the gospel &gt;&gt; but that's the right attitude &gt;&gt; that's the right motive Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's take it to souls. &gt;&gt; God don't want you to die and go to heaven alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants you to be a witness and take someone with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People love that thing. Amen. I came into this world with nothing. I'll go with nothing. Hey, take someone with you. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Give God praise. Amen. Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't be selfish. Okay, &gt;&gt; have a concern. &gt;&gt; I've just given you the key in this very simple message is how to operate on a higher dimension of faith and level of faith is by knowing what the word says about you. &gt;&gt; In all the years in the message, do you know the scriptures concerning yourself? &gt;&gt; Do [clears throat] you know where we are in that part of scripture? &gt;&gt; When you're reading Revelation 10, we didn't have time to go into it. Reading Revelation 10 1-1 there, do you know which part of that plan we are in? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we still waiting for the mighty angel to come down with the open book? &gt;&gt; Are we still waiting for Revelation 10:7 to sound? &gt;&gt; Are we still waiting for the angel to tell us come take the book? &gt;&gt; Are we still on our way to take the book? &gt;&gt; Or have we taken the book and eaten it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And are we now standing and prophesying again? Which part? We determine which part we are in. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Where are we? Know what the word says about us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, next next service, what we're going to do is we're going to have a quiz &gt;&gt; and we're going to ask you to tell us scriptures that's concerning you, &gt;&gt; concerning us, &gt;&gt; what's the scripture saying about me? &gt;&gt; Because the prophet is saying that's how to now position ourselves in that world of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; To know what the word says about us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, did everyone hear that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to do a general discussion and a quiz to ask you what the word says about you. &gt;&gt; And then you must give me your scripture, &gt;&gt; brother. Here in the scripture, it says this about me. Here it is written of me. Here it is written of me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen.
