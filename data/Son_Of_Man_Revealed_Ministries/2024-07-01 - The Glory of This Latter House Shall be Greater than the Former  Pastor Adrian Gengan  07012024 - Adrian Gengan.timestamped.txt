[5:57] says that you must honor your mother and
[5:59] father
[6:00] so that your days will be long upon the
[6:01] face of the Earth amen hallelujah so if
[6:04] some of you are living very long we know
[6:06] that you were honoring your mother and
[6:08] father amen praise the Lord so this
[6:11] morning we'll speak on the glory of the
[6:14] L house shall be greater than the former
[6:18] amen the glory of the latter house shall
[6:21] be greater than the former and our
[6:24] scripture reading will be AI
[6:28] 2:9
[6:40] amen scripture reads the glory of this
[6:44] latter house shall be greater than of
[6:47] the
[6:48] former sayth the Lord of hosts now this
[6:51] is that sayith the
[6:53] Lord the brightest th seeth the Lord she
[6:56] keep
[6:56] still
[6:58] amen the glory of this L house shall be
[7:01] greater than the former sayi the Lord of
[7:03] hosts and in this place I will give
[7:06] Shalom amen say the Lord of hosts now we
[7:10] know in Shalom he took a right Shine for
[7:13] thy light has come amen so when he is
[7:15] giving Shalom he's giving us a seven
[7:18] seal light which gives us perfect peace
[7:21] amen when all Satan's schemes is
[7:23] uncovered and the Mystery of redemption
[7:25] is fully revealed to us it puts us at
[7:27] peace and it makes us joy joyful because
[7:30] the true meaning of joy is knowing the
[7:32] end
[7:33] result and remaining joyful amen
[7:37] hallelujah so that is a prophecy over
[7:40] us that the glory of this latter house
[7:43] shall be greater than the former amen
[7:45] Joel 2: 24:25 amen hallelujah I Pray by
[7:50] the time we read the scripture you're
[7:51] going to get into the spirit of this
[7:53] word amen hallelujah Joel 2: 24 says and
[7:58] the floor shall be full of wheat
[8:02] amen this is not talking about the
[8:04] temple that he's building the glory of
[8:07] the from the latter house this is you
[8:10] now your floor shall be full of Wheat
[8:13] and the fat shall overflow with wine
[8:16] Revelation amen and oil Holy Ghost there
[8:20] shall be an overflow yes and I will
[8:23] restore to you the years that the Locust
[8:25] has eaten and the cankerworm and the
[8:28] caterpillar and the palmerworm my great
[8:31] Army which I sent amongst you so
[8:33] whatever happened through seven Church
[8:34] ages God is restoring the church to its
[8:37] former glory but not only to its former
[8:39] glory he says this house shall be
[8:41] greater amen amen amen amen you may be
[8:45] seated the Lord at blessings to the
[8:46] reading of his word amen so we know that
[8:49] the first house was Solomon's
[8:52] Temple just to bring in context you can
[8:54] put up that first verse we read again if
[8:58] you're looking for what what is the
[8:59] former house how am I going to be
[9:02] greater the former house was Solomon's
[9:04] Temple where the presence of the Lord
[9:06] came down amen now every time the glory
[9:10] of the Lord comes down he comes down
[9:12] when there's a sacrifice on the
[9:16] altar amen the presence of the Lord
[9:18] comes down to consume the
[9:21] sacrifice so what is the second temple
[9:24] now we know the Lord does not dwell in
[9:26] temples made with hands so the second
[9:28] temp Temple that the Lord is building we
[9:31] find here in 1 Corinthians 6:9 he says
[9:34] knowing not that your body is the Temple
[9:36] of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen which
[9:39] is in you amen amen how if you got the
[9:42] Holy Ghost In You amen I don't want the
[9:44] Holy Ghost outside of me amen I I don't
[9:47] want the Holy Ghost on my flesh that's
[9:49] why you find people jumping and shouting
[9:51] amen but no life amen hallelujah I don't
[9:54] want the Holy Ghost only on my spirit
[9:57] amen but I want the Holy Ghost in my
[9:59] soul
[10:00] am amen that's the true baptism of the
[10:03] Holy Ghost and that is the true meaning
[10:05] of that quote if you can receive the
[10:07] word for your day and your
[10:10] age yes sir that's a sign you got the
[10:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost because the
[10:14] only way you can receive the word for
[10:16] your day is to receive it in your soul
[10:19] amen amen hallelujah because in the soul
[10:22] resides Faith or doubt amen and to doubt
[10:25] the message of the hour is not to
[10:27] receive the holy ghost in your soul
[10:29] but to receive the message of the hour
[10:31] is to receive the holy ghost in your
[10:33] soul give God praise amen that you have
[10:36] the Holy Ghost in your
[10:38] soul that's the difference between us
[10:40] and denominations some have it in the
[10:42] flesh some have it in the spirit amen
[10:44] some have it in the outer Court some
[10:46] have it in the inner court but we have
[10:48] taken it into the holiest of holiest
[10:50] amen amen amen second Corinthians 6:16
[10:54] says what agreement at the temple of God
[10:57] with Idols now we just
[10:59] said that we are the temple of God so
[11:02] why are the idols set up in the temple
[11:04] of God Amen we have suckig as Idols amen
[11:08] we have musicians as Idols we have all
[11:10] kinds of things and people set set up as
[11:13] Idols in the temple of God he's saying
[11:17] what agreement at the temple of God with
[11:19] Idols for you are the Temple of the
[11:21] Living God and God had said I will dwell
[11:24] in them and walk in them amen amen amen
[11:28] if you're looking for God outside of you
[11:30] you are going to miss it God is walking
[11:32] in the midst of
[11:35] you and I will be their God and they
[11:37] shall be my
[11:39] people amen now you know that when
[11:42] somebody builds a house they's
[11:46] planning amen so we're talking about the
[11:49] glory of the latter of this latter house
[11:52] shall be greater than the former house
[11:54] yes so when somebody's building a house
[11:57] there's planning there's imagination
[12:00] there's creativity they have a vision of
[12:02] what they want you to look like then
[12:05] they employ a plan draw or an architect
[12:08] amen and they design what they have in
[12:11] their mind they put it down as a
[12:14] drawing then once that plan is passed
[12:17] they get the builders to go to
[12:19] work that's what the five4 ministry is
[12:21] doing building according to the
[12:23] blueprint that God had in the back part
[12:26] of his mind hallelujah amen God is using
[12:28] the fful Ministry to build his church to
[12:32] equip his church to empower the church
[12:36] amen
[12:37] hallelujah amen now the Lord says that
[12:41] we now we just said that we are the
[12:44] temple of God so if God designed us God
[12:46] had a thought of us God had an
[12:48] imagination of us amen then the Lord
[12:50] says we are fearfully and wonderfully
[12:54] made people may look down on you people
[12:57] may say all manner of things of you but
[12:59] you need declare the scripture don't
[13:01] believe a man's word you say I am
[13:03] fearfully and wonderfully made they say
[13:05] you're good for nothing say amen I am
[13:08] fearfully and wonderfully made
[13:10] amen amen the Lord says that he knows
[13:13] the plans that he has for
[13:16] you amen not to arm you but to give you
[13:20] a hope and a future so God has designed
[13:22] the plan so that we would reach
[13:24] glorification and nothing or no one can
[13:27] change the plan yes
[13:30] amen amen the same way in this life now
[13:33] you can choose the type of life you want
[13:36] on this Earth God has put the Power of
[13:38] Choice within you you're a free moral
[13:41] agent amen you can choose your career
[13:44] you can choose your partner you want to
[13:45] marry in this life it is all your choice
[13:50] yeah how many if you know the prophet of
[13:52] God teaches that you can choose to
[13:55] become whatever you want your current
[13:57] state that you are in now the financial
[14:00] State your marital State any state that
[14:02] you are in physically is because of the
[14:04] choices you made yes right amen nobody
[14:08] forced you even if if it was arranged
[14:11] marriage you had to agree to
[14:13] it right amen nobody put a gun to your
[14:18] head you could have said no so the
[14:20] prophet tells us you can't say
[14:23] no
[14:25] amen but in all your choices my encour
[14:28] enement to you is put God
[14:30] first amen you young people will will
[14:34] start to make many choices in life but
[14:37] put God
[14:38] first amen doesn't the scripture teach
[14:41] us seeking first the kingdom of God Amen
[14:45] you see if you go seeking material
[14:47] things according to the will of your own
[14:50] flesh maybe you'll achieve something but
[14:53] it may not be what God wanted for
[14:56] you maybe you'll achieve buying a
[14:59] three-bedroom house but maybe in God's
[15:01] economy he had a six-bedroom house for
[15:03] you but you went and pursued your own
[15:06] plan and now you got a three-bedroom
[15:08] house but in God's
[15:11] mind six-bedroom
[15:14] house amen hallelujah amen maybe you
[15:19] went and pursued your own way and you
[15:21] married
[15:22] Jezebel but in God's mind he had you
[15:24] married to
[15:26] Esther now you got to live with Jezebel
[15:28] all the days of your life why it's the
[15:31] choices you
[15:32] make amen so my encouragement to the
[15:35] young people run as far away as possible
[15:38] from
[15:39] Jezebel amen or that other woman who
[15:42] likes to stroke your
[15:44] hair what's her name
[15:47] Delilah she likes to stroke your hair
[15:50] and cut your locks off cut your power
[15:53] you know you know you must see them
[15:55] around the girl they're like a
[15:57] puppy
[15:59] powerless weak yes
[16:02] love okay
[16:04] love you can't go to church today okay
[16:10] love what did the prophet says petty
[16:13] coat

[16:17] pett
[16:19] coats what did you get for Christmas my
[16:22] wife bought me a new penic
[16:27] coat hey amen but God established it
[16:31] according to his word and we've got to
[16:32] come the biblical way yes amen amen
[16:36] hallelujah praise the Lord so whatever
[16:39] we choose to do in life put God first
[16:41] whatever you imagine to do in this life
[16:43] have the faith to Believe in Your Vision
[16:46] you know some of us wrote Visions down
[16:48] it didn't come to pass and now we are in
[16:52] impatience we are thinking that God is
[16:54] not working according to his plan you
[16:56] know God wrote A Vision down he gave his
[16:59] vision to Isaiah the prophet and he said
[17:01] a virgin shall conceive 800 years
[17:07] passed before that Vision came to pass
[17:11] he didn't write the name Mary there but
[17:13] God had already designed the woman that
[17:15] would make that Vision come to pass he
[17:18] says write the vision though it car wait
[17:21] for it for it must come to
[17:24] pass amen praise the Lord so the tearing
[17:28] the waiting does not mean it is not
[17:30] meant for you amen it does not mean that
[17:34] amen it's not meant for you but God will
[17:35] bring it to pass in the right time and
[17:37] the right season am you know there are

[29:47] law and he says righteousness comes from
[29:51] God comes through faith in Jesus Christ
[29:54] to all who believe so if you ever
[29:55] feeling unrighteous stop relying on your
[29:58] own
[29:59] righteousness if you're
[30:01] feeling unrighteous you're relying on
[30:04] your own righteousness the Bible says
[30:05] our righteousness is as filthy
[30:07] rags amen there's nothing you can do in
[30:10] this life to present yourself righteous

[30:54] chose to follow the voice of his wife
[30:56] rather than follow the voice of God
[30:59] yes you see Brothers why it's so
[31:06] important Adam

[31:12] wife the voice of his wife over the
[31:16] voice of
[31:18] God amen
[31:21] amen you had to bypass your theophany
[31:24] you had to come down here in the flesh
[31:26] to be tempted by sin
[31:28] he says but look when this body receives
[31:30] the spirit of God The Immortal Life
[31:32] inside of you it throws this body in
[31:34] subjection to God he that's born of God
[31:38] does not commit sin he cannot sin but he
[31:41] says when this life is finished here if
[31:43] this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we
[31:45] have one waiting that's where we go that
[31:48] is the word amen praise the Lord how
[31:51] many if you have got one waiting how
