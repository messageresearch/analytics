[Music] amen all right amen Psalms 20 128 and verse 1 reads amen blessed is everyone that fear of the Lord that walketh in his ways for Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands happy shall thou be and it shall be well with thee thy wife shall be a fruitful Vine by the sides of that house thy children like Olive plants round about thy table behold that thus shall the man be blessed the fear of the Lord the Lord shall Bless The Art of Zion and thou shall see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life yea Thou shalt see thy children's children and peace upon Israel amen what a glorious blessing amen now I don't want my wife to be scared when I read thy wife shall be a fruitful Vine by the size of that house amen the Lord has blessed us with three beautiful children and we want to return praise and honor to God this morning amen for a beautiful gift he's given us amen and that's what the dedication is to return the gift back to God Amen so the baby's name is amen and Everlast is the Hebrew origin it comes from the word Ari or Ari meaning lion and L meaning God so it means Lion of God Amen so in the Bible it was uh we don't know if it was I think it's a gender Mutual name but it was the son of God which was Jacob's first son amen ever lie so Ella is derived from the Hebrew element of L meaning God so Ella means God is my light amen so we got light of God and God is my light and Gengar means King of Kings and the Lord of lords whatever you want to make it means amen amen hallelujah because again is Christ in this hour Moses was Christ David was Christ I'm telling you gengan is Christ amen God bless you let's turn to Mark chapter 10 amen if the grandparents want to come and uh you're more than welcome let's call the grandparents forward and come stand here we'll get some pictures amen Hallelujah I was telling brother Joshua the other day about a year and a half ago I stood at a bedside and watched life leave a body and about four weeks ago or just three and a half weeks ago I stood at another bedside and watched life into her body and throughout the entire birth process when Carol mentioned to labor I could only think of things that are to be and who is this Melchizedek because he's teaching us how life comes into the body he's telling us how there's a spirit waiting to meet that body yes and when the baby takes that first breath Spirit enters their body so while Cameron was going through all the pain and the suffering I was just trying to understand what's going on in spiritual realm right there and I didn't want to miss that opportunity and it was a beautiful moment amen Mark chapter 10 verse 13 says and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it it was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put in put his hands upon them and bless them so the property is so bad in the Bible they brought little children to Jesus that he might bless them and he put hands upon them and we do the same he says we continue to do that let's just think bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus [Music] can we bow heads together how much gracious God and Heavenly Father we stand the Lord with this precious gift in our hands Lord we stand your honor father that you have entrusted us precious little gift to God Lord truly we can say Lord From the Bottom of our hearts that you give and you take away your lord and father even as you have given us Lord appearance this precious little gift to the ways in the admonition of Jesus Christ will God I pray you'll help us to be faithful parents about Jesus to raise up and nurture father in the atmosphere of the Lord Jesus Christ and Lord even as you said mother is the First Gospel Lord Jesus Lord to raise the child or teach the child away from the Lord we pray Lord that you bless Karen the Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for your hand upon her during the birth of God and Lord for giving us safe and successful delivery Lord Jesus we thank you for good health upon the Lord amen we also thank you for the baby Lord of Jesus the baby is in perfect helpful God Amen may you continue to be with all the days of our life may you be a protection yes Father we live in a wicked and an evil generation Lord but I pray O Lord that you will keep our Lord from every evil arm and danger father and may Lord you always look to you father as you always put you first in your amazing and Lord even as we read that scripture father Lord that they brought little children into you alone and father if you were here we would place that into your hands Lord Jesus but we stand here as representatives of you Lord Jesus and we come to you now father presenting her to you Lord Jesus we pray Lord that you would continue to be with the Lord may she grow in Grace Lord Jesus and keep the Lord in health of God and Father whatever the Satan may come to try and bring his schemes Lord we curse and we bind those schemes in our mighty name of Jesus Lord Jesus and we ask him to take his hands off of God's Property Lord Jesus into your hand and we dedicate him into your hand Lord for a life of service in your kingdom Lord we dedicate our life Ela Gengar in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with much Thanksgiving in our hearts amen yes [Music] foreign but it's one of the most beautiful feelings amen hallelujah and and unless we come like babes in Christ amen Christ wants to Hold Us in his bosom amen so amen let's stand for the reading of the word this morning for a little title will speak on Queen of Queens amen he's the king of kings and he has a wife so if he is the king of kings then we must be the queen of Queens amen [Music] Hallelujah amen let's turn to our Bible Esther chapter 2 verse 15. Esther chapter 2 and verse 15. now when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abby Hale the uncle of Mordecai which had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what a guy the King's chamberlained The Keeper of the woman appointed Hallelujah now we've got to see ourselves in that time we required nothing but what the seventh angel messenger had told us and yes to obtain favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her amen and this bride in this hour has favored so Esther was taken now not only did she find favor with all that looked upon her so remember she required nothing now she comes into the king's presence so Esther was taken into King azerus into his house Royal in the 10th month amen hallelujah notice now the scripture amen it's put them mathematically yes Revelation 10 7 is put them mathematically in order when John was writing Revelation 10 he didn't number it but God and the inspiration when they were numbering the Bible they numbered 10-7 so in the 10th month she was brought into the house which is the month of in the seventh year of his Reign Amen in the seventh year in the seventh Church age of the reign of Christ um this queen was brought into the house and the King loved yesterday above all the women above every denomination amen and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made a Queen instead of vashti then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even Esther's feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king and when he ascended on high he gave gifts unto men amen now what she required nothing let's just turn to First Timothy verse 2 and 9. Amen to see the kind of desire that Queen Esther had it says in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel would shame facelessness and sobriety not with braided hair of gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh woman professing godliness with good works let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach no serp authority over the man but to be in silence amen may the Lord a blessing should reading of his word you may be seated so queen of Queens the one who's married to the King of Kings we'll go to our first quotation which is found in Amen in the in the bridge message we find that the prophet is saying in paragraph 228 the lamb is the only mediator he was the one that came forth but what did he do now he's been back there interceding until his blood at a tone for every person and the lamb now knows what's written in the book he note from the foundation of the world their names were in there he stood back here and then the mediatorial work till everyone that's put in the book has been redeemed and it's finished now he walks out he's done the Kinsman walk he knows the Kinsman work was to testify before the elders you remember Boaz ticking off his shoe and so forth he has done all this now now this is the point I want to get to he says now he comes to take his bride so when he's coming in Revelation chapter 5 he is coming to take his bride he says amen he comes now as king he is looking for his Queen amen he says amen amen in this book is the old secret of it wrapped up around Seven Seals Seven Seals waiting for him to come amen now this Bride is a virtuous bride amen virtues mean that she is honest she is courageous she is compassionate she has generosity she has fidelity she has Integrity fairness amen and she has Prudence like the Bible tells us in Proverbs 31 that a husband is known in the gates didn't we just read the Kinsmen work that he was known in the gates the Bible says he's known in the gates ways centered amongst the Elders of the land and she make it fine linen and sell it yet she delivereth girdles unto Merchants strengthen honor our clothing she shall rejoice in time to come she opened her mouth with wisdom and in a tongue is the law of kindness should look it well to the ways of our household and he did not the bread of idleness amen the king's household is on the earth now amen Jesus prayed let thy kingdom come let thy will be done amen so the kingdom of God we must look well upon his household amen he says eat not the bread of idleness a children rise up and call her blessed a husband also and praise with her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excels them all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that filled the Lord she shall be praised give us the fruits of her hands and let your own words praise her in the gates now we know that marriage on the earth is a type of the Heavenly marriage between Christ and the church amen now in the natural marriage you'll find the prophet is telling us that a decision has to be made yes a young lady has to make a decision you young ladies that are unmarried one day you will have to make a decision some guy is going to approach you and ask you for your hand in marriage before that there may be other flirters come along other people who just want to maybe get to know you and maybe just kiss you a little bit and just hold your hand a little bit but you have a sacred virtue that's that's been entrusted to you that you have got to be virtuous and true to your husband even before you are married the same way the church amen so she has to make a decision whether she wants this young man and the young man has to make a decision whether he wants the young woman and the prophet says she must be the only woman in the world that you love and he must be the only man now that doesn't fade after you get married after five years after 10 years after 20 years she must still be the only woman you love oh I was expecting a stronger amen than death he must still be the only man that you love I know I know after 20 years of marriage it's hard to remember the love now you are living by grace when you were getting married you were married in love now you are married by grace anyone ask you how's your marriage by grace of the Lord Brother [Music] but we should never lose that affection for one another we should always be in love with one another and you know you know when when there's a distance being created between you and your wife anyone knows what stonewalling is you know when we stone wall one another you walk past like trains going past each other but let love abound disagreements will come amen but love will cover a multitude of sin amen hallelujah so remember that she must be the only woman you love and he must be the only man that you love and the prophet says it's the same way making a decision for Christ the first thing you have to do is make up your mind whether you're going to serve God and take him as your savior or you're not going to do it yes yes are you going to serve the world or are you going to serve Christ you have to make up your mind there has to be a decision made and after the decision is made the prophet says that engagement comes amen then you find that at the altar you make an engagement before that before this Union can be and that's the way it's what Christ Church has to be an engagement a pledge because you ain't a love of fear beautiful after that this promise is made For Your Precious Love climb the highest mountain now you can't climb up the bank when she tells you to weed the garden For Your Precious Love I'll swarm the deepest sea but you can't get a glass of water when she asks you hey there's got to be promises one another I want to tell you this morning your vowels until death do your part and it's a man's responsibility to provide for the home yes I know we are living in times where economic conditions are difficult and the wife has to work to assist the husband but the primary responsibility lies with the husband to take his responsibility and be a provider at home and that doesn't change as the years go on yeah amen she you have a responsibility to take care of your children don't let other men take care of your children if you have been praying for a job value the job that God has given you the moment people get jobs the next week they're complaining about the job but a week before they were fasting and praying Lord make a way for me give me this job they are quoting scriptures Lord I speak to this mountain now when the job is given to them they're lazy lazy do not want to work the Bible goes on to say if a man doesn't work he shouldn't eat en amen amen amen and I want to also emphasize that that promise and that responsibility is also till dead to your part amen amen what are we saying Christ is a great responsible provider he takes care of all of our needs according to his riches in glory he doesn't let us bid for stuff that's right but he provides according to our needs and our desires sometimes we do not have enough is because we do not ask him but we've got to come to God by faith and ask of him beautiful and I want you to know put your husband under Lotus that I am going to ask for big things didn't the didn't the propheties ask God for big things yeah yeah now who now what Ephesians 5 back to him sisters when he is quoting that you must be submissive quote Ephesians 5 back to him say as Christ is the head of the church the husband is the head of the wife so quote Ephesians back to him and when the prophet says ask God for big things tell him honey I cannot see God right now but you are God's representative on the earth and I see you as my head so I'm asking you for big things can you have that Faith this morning [Music] amen what will it do it will put him on his knees to say Lord my wife is trusting you my wife has this requirement Lord won't you open up the windows of Heaven father and provide for me and my household you are following a divine order and a Divine passion and if we know how to walk with God's divine order and divine pattern then we will be blessed amen hallelujah he says we start to make promises one to another he says Twitter if you marry me I promise I'll be loyal and true I will look upon no other woman or I look upon no other man and I'll do a duty as a wife we have children it'll be my duty as a mother I'll be a housekeeper all these promises has got to be made and should be in a correct wedding if that guy's gonna make you give promises stay away children because your word is your bond if the only question he ever asks you is will you marry me and he's made you no promise then you can't hold him to nothing because even The Vow is reciting there somebody is forcing him to recite that vow repeat after me the guy probably never been to church in his life he's coming into the message to marry you and now the past is telling him repeat after me I am mukhu take thee to be and he's just repeating everything why he wants you the prophet says listen all these promises has got to be made or should be in a correct wedding come on come on amen he says the same way when you come to Christ Lord if you will receive me into your kingdom I promise there you are I love you I'll be true to you I'll serve you day and night it's too bad we forget that but let's come back to our first love let's remember the promises of God amen we always want to remind God of his promises towards us how about we remember the time when we promised the Lord that we would serve him when we promise the Lord if he healed us we would serve him amen amen he says here listen I'll serve you day and night I'll fast and I'll pray I'll be loyal to you I'll bring my Tidings into the straw house I'll pray many times a day I'll do anything I'll pledge all my love to you that's what you should do that's exactly right where you promised that it should come from your heart not because Billy Graham or Oral Roberts said come say a sinner's prayer but there should be a true conviction of the heart there should be a true repentance of the Soul amen we've got to come and he says when we take that pledge that's in paragraph 89 now if we don't become part of him like a woman become part of the man or the man part of a woman then we are artificial Christians amen the prophet will go on now to tell you that you're not really married to that woman hello you could have a marriage certificate but he said if you are not connected together as one he says you are not really married to that woman listen to what he says now you might be loyal if you don't love your husband him 60 or 70 years old yes to the older people now if you don't love your wife uh 67 years old and you don't love him as good as you did in the beginning then you're really just raising his children amen he says that's the way too many churches are we're just taking the name of Christian Church pretending to be bride when it's artificial we're not connected with the Christ in any way we're like an artificial tooth artificial arm artificial eye and he says anything artificial we're just putting on but we can't put on Chris Christianity you've got to be connected with it amen and that's what's the matter he says with the denominational Church they had never come into a deep relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ they have not connected with him amen and they are artificial Church yes he says in 93 one thing sure friends we are not going to deceive Christ he knows his own amen so first decisions next engagement then promise then the ceremony that's when the bride takes the bridegroom's name amen she is no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom's name amen that's why I am titling it queen of Queens we have taken on his name yes amen he says when the church has the ceremony makes the promises then she takes the bridegroom's name she is no longer a church of the world she is the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I mean I don't mean by name I mean by birth by Nature by power of God by the revealed truth of God in the heart she becomes the Christian church at the great Universal Apostolic Christian Church she becomes part of Christ when she does that Christ injects into his own Spirit his own life and the Bible said so that Adam and Eve you are no longer tween but one and when the woman the church is married to Christ they are no longer two they are one question you his life has been brought to you then you become his bride listen he's going to emphasize this point and we're going to hit at it this morning he says another thing after these vows have been taken the ceremony has said my wife's name was broy before she was married she is no longer a boy she is Branham now she is no more boy she is Branham so when you're coming to Christ you know more of the world you are of Christ you cannot for the things of the world they are dead to you for he that loves the world or the things of the world the love of God is not in you amen hallelujah now taking his name many people want to take his name that's why in the message he tells you Blasphemous names we have many lodges that just took his name amen but they are artificial Christians they just have his name on the building amen Hallelujah but he says when we take his name we and he injects his life in us what is that injection of life it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's go to 101 there he says you can't become a Christian until Christ injects himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into you then you're connected with him yes amen the connection comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you're no longer trained you are one I and my father one you and I are one amen all that was in God according to Christ and all that was in Christ is born into you his church his beloved wife amen and that's why we don't have an artificial name we know the name of the Lord amen some don't know the name they're still wondering what's the name so they recite something that relates to the name they say in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost because they are not too clear what the name is but there's a revelation been given to the Bride of Jesus Christ then his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen now we are dead to the things of the world we are debt to denominational ideas and Creeds and dogmas we are dead to every tradition that comes into the message and we only have it here for the Master's Voice amen we are sitting with him in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen we are a different person a different personality because we are becoming New Creation hallelujah thank you Lord now in 104 it goes on to re-emphasize us and I'm getting to a scripture now just like the woman there's no more broad she's a Branham she goes by that name then there's been churches churches brights but they must come one who pays his name amen hallelujah let's turn to Isaiah 4 1. you see what this woman were after Isaiah 4 chapter 1. some of some brothers maybe know the scripture of my heart because they're waiting for a fulfillment of the scripture amen Isaiah 1 1 says and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and weigh our own apparel was the parable given to Esther only let us be called by thy name what are they after the name they just want to be called a Christian Church why it's a reproach take away our reproach seven women come through seven Church ages seven women claim to have his name but in the evening time it shall be light amen hallelujah in the evening time the great floodlights of Heaven were shown down upon the Earth and every denominational cockroach yet to SketchUp because the Rises Shine for thy light has come and he exposed every one of those churches as being spirits of antichrist amen yes amen that's right he exposed their skirts for the garments were spotted [Music] amen and he found a virtuous bride amen hallelujah he says amen listen to what he says the church needs he says the thing that 114 now if she only knew it being part of him with his spirit in her the words that I do shall you do also believe for it hello the what shall I do shall you do also amen amen greater than this shall you do for God for I go unto my father a little while and the world me no more yet you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world then it's question you you can together your heirs with him when Esther walked into the kingdom that day and a title changed and a name changed she'd not only changed title and name she changed everything about her she was once a proper living in Mordecai's house she was once an orphaned girl maybe with not much money but the day that ceremony took place The Riches of their Kingdom even to have was given to Esther and the same Royal grants has been open to the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ in this hour the problem with it we are not drawing fans from that account we have unlimited unkept resources this morning amen my my message to you this morning withdraw from Heaven's bent this morning you will not get insufficient funds there amen you will not get a message please contact your bank amen what amen but every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse and every line amen you speak the word the word will not return void but it will return unto you press down shaken together and running over hallelujah amen thank you Lord in 115 he says if Jesus was here on Earth what would he be doing he'll be doing the same things because he's the same yesterday today and forever but I want you to know he has left you in charge of the family business he's left you in charge of the royal household when a man leaves home the wife is in charge of the home he's left you in charge of the royal household and he didn't take his bank card with him because hallelujah amen such as I have give I unto thee amen amen hallelujah you remember amen hallelujah Caleb Caleb's daughter came to him after he had become possessor of the land and his inheritance amen you remember she got married and she came and said Dad give me the Apple Springs she was making a claim amen she maybe didn't fight today in her life but Caleb fought many battles inside Joshua amen but yet she comes and says Dad can you give me the upper Springs when he says amen my daughter thou has been well favored in my sight such as I have give eye unto thee not only do I give you the upper Springs but I give you the lower Springs amen amen amen amen Our God wants to bless us more than we desire to be blessed sometimes you know children when you want to bless them they become stubborn they become arrogant they don't want to hear what you got to say they're pulling their faces don't pull your face in the presence of God God wants to bless you more than you desire to be blessed God knows what you have need of yes you want some little toy from the shop but he wants to buy you a gold bar this morning [Music] it shall be performing Miracles you'll be doing exactly what he did when he was here on Earth because he remains the same yesterday today and forever [Music] amen that's like now watch as an admonition to the church he says when a woman gets married takes these vows and everything she becomes this man's husband a wife she's heir to all he's got yes I want you to go home and read that Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me now brother Caleb when you marry a community of property or brother Jefe Joshua when you married community of property and the man is there of all things who owns half of it does he need to give a concept I want you to go back and read Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me he was given a name above every other names amen the prophet says he was taken so high and placed above heavens of heavens [Music] right she's heir to all he's got yeah yeah and so forth but he says and there now watch is giving a message of warning but if she goes wild she starts off on a tantrum she starts running off after TD Jakes yeah and smiley Joel and what's this guy's name you don't know good I was trying to catch you there you learned from the last house amen what's this guy's name big rabbis you'll see them on YouTube as your pastor I want to tell you this morning the red effort is not assigned to you I label to tell you maybe in the last two Services the final sign given to the Gentile Church and he typed this with Genesis was the back turn to Sarah and the discernment of Sarah's art and he said you're seeing your final sign let me ask you this why are we getting excited about rare efforts when there's no Temple yeah what are they going to do with the red efforts nothing gonna cost them more grass they need Temple to be restored there's no Temple that is not a sign for us to be excited about why are we going over into the Book of Revelation 11 and looking for signs for what people want to buy parts and this is the tactic of the enemy what comes before revelation 11. people not ex not satisfied with revelation 10. Revelation 10 11 says Thou must prophesy again amen they don't want to do that they do not want to prophesy again they are looking for a false promise rated for in Israel why don't you send funds to feed them keep the red effort alive amen not only that it becomes idolatry let me tell you why because when you have revelation of the word it becomes idolatry to now sacrifice right what they are doing God's not going to accept you think God's going to accept that red effort when it's finally sacrificed what did the Apostle Paul labor to tell us that the law of the sacrifice was taken away and by one sacrifice through one blood Christ has redeemed all men by his blood amen I am telling you watch it very carefully and I'm telling this as your pastor it becomes idolatry it becomes Baal Pagan worship amen that's right and I'll say it again God is not going to accept the sacrifice of the ready for because when they begin to try and explain it to them Moses and Elijah is going to tell them hey guys isn't that what Feast of the trumpets is recognizing your day and its message hey they're gonna he's gonna tell them you missed it why are you sacrifice why are you killing this poor animal amen let's get back to our message that was just by the way amen so we know amen we are taking his name we value the name amen now [Music] we read that okay we stopped on 115. 116 he says what if a woman gets married takes all these vows and everything she becomes the man's wife she's heir to all he's God so forth and she goes wild she starts off on a tantrum starts running after other men not only that she starts sharing her love with others a man with his wife all the promises that has been made then she goes out and starts sharing her life with others a love and affection with others he says that's what too many so-called Christians do sharing your love with the world what she breaks it down playing dancing gambling staying home from praying meetings to watch television all kinds of worldly things that took place of the love of God in the church's heart she's gone on a tantrum she's gone wild she's gone out after other men she's sharing her love she'll take a tithing and she'll give it to the church she'll spend it on other things out there in the world instead of loving God the way she should and living for God and loving to come to church you almost have to persuade her to come right I don't need to say more you know week after week how we try and persuade you to come listen to the type of woman he's saying that you have to persuade to come the woman that's gone wild that's gone out after other men he says you have to persuade to come to church let's leave that he's going to have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle enough she's only Washed by the blood of his own self that's right see where we stand the waiting getting ready to come let's turn to Revelation chapter 19 and verse 6. he says then I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many Waters and the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth I want you to notice who is speaking now it's the voice of many Waters what does brother Brandon says it's the voice of the ministers crying out to the people what are they saying they further go on to say let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come Hallelujah and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she be a raid in fine linen yeah this is Esther now in time clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints anything to go and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called to the married supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God he says here in 172 Esther was to become a bride she didn't want none of the dawning of the world she wanted to go in to the king just like she was she adorned themselves like the Pentecostal or two with a Meek humble Spirit when all these fancy first ladies come by with their new Fandango things the king looked at them and put them in the chamber with the concubines but when this Ester coming to sight he got a glimpse of that sweet humble Meek Spirit he said that's her go get a crown and put it on her head that's it amen he says let them Adorn themselves with that kind of spirit not only the woman but the men too Adorn themselves with that kind of spirit then you become ready for the bride sweet Reverend Esther made her heart clean right he says we have to have wrinkle removers to get it out of our garments Esther cleaned herself she cleaned the heart that's what the church need a hard cleaning brother Branham asked the question how do you clean your heart brother Branham washed By the Waters of the word through the blood of Jesus Christ Esther Purge the heart before God walked with a Meek humble Spirit the church that's going to be the bride of Christ Esther refused worldly adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king Esther didn't want to Adorn herself with the modern apparel of the world that wouldn't look like a King's wife he says in 216 now the hour has come the bride has made itself ready oh made herself ready she laid aside all the things remember Esther was chosen the others were rejected and only those that's born again that's got the spirit of God will be chosen that day that the Crown of Glory will set upon ahead and the others will be rejected in 178 now in the message Israel and the church he says oh the Bride of Jesus Christ will be Mrs Jesus Christ Hallelujah baptized in his name baptized in his spirit in his name filled with his power robed in his righteousness Hallelujah there she is now and now notice that was the gentle bride in the message once more he says a name he says you say Amen name means nothing then why did God change Abram's name to Abraham why did he change Saul to Paul Simon's name to Peter why did he change his own name why did he change Jacob to Israel not until He restored the Lord not until he overcome now when Jesus overcome death hell and the grave the Bible says he had a new name and when Jacob overcome and if the church can overcome she will stop saying I am Methodist Baptist Presbyterian message believer when she can overcome her Creeds and the world that's drawn in her there she'll come back to the Bride of Jesus Christ misses Jesus Christ amen amen reclaim your name reclaim your inheritance amen let me tell you the name carries an anointing the name carries a blessing the name gives you access to the blessings amen so you are Mrs Jesus Christ you are the queen of queens and Jesus is your name you are Mrs Jesus Christ amen you are heir to the Royal Grant now I just want to describe what the Royal Grant is to you the Royal Grant is a fund that is set up to take care of the needs of the king and the Queen not only the king and the queen but the daughters the Dukes the duchesses the prince the princesses to take care of the royal household amen amen and Abraham was given access to this Royal ground the prophet says and he says we as the Bride of Jesus Christ have been given access to the Royal branch amen not only are we the queen of Queens we are the queen of his heart we hold a special place in the heart of almighty God Amen we are the darling of Heaven amen you are the darling of Heaven amen like the Bible says in Proverbs the heart of her husbands safely trusting her amen she is a lovely lady of the world we are not spoiling our Scots with the world Amen what are we doing we know that Christ is the word so we know how to care for the word we know what the value of the word is amen we know to hide the word in our hearts amen we know that what the prophet like the prophet says what he wants done with the word what are we doing we are about our father's business we are about our husband's business laboring to bring forth an increase amen whatever our hand touches like the Proverbs 31 Woman is blessed she has worked to express her faith we are not sitting idle in the house but we have Works to express our faith amen the faith she receives coming from the word of God we are being watered by the word day and night amen what are we doing we are feeding upon the body word of the son of man amen we know where to get fresh meat we are not eating a word from a day gone by but we are getting fresh meat every day eating and drinking daily from the inexhaustible Fountain of the Living God amen we do not run away from the fountain but we stay close to the fountain amen stays close to the sauce she understands that a Perfection is tied to the five office gifts because Ephesians 4 11 says for the Perfection of the Saints so she understands that a Perfection is tied to the office gifts amen so she has respect for death and because it's also for the Perfection of the Saints amen for it's also a duty to the word that she has respect for the office gifts she does not slander discuss gossip amen or criticize the gifts that he sent to her but rather she Embraces them prays for them knowing that these men under a great attack from the kingdom of Satan in this hour Satan and his kingdom as all the heroes and their guns pointed at the five form Ministry because of iPhone Ministry is given for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ and if that is God's protection over the church if that is God's stress way that's where the attack is going amen and we ask ourselves questions how come ministers are falling that is why they are being attacked yeah amen [Music] amen the greatest attack is coming upon them because if he can get the heads of churches what will happen to the body what will happen to the Sheep he will scatter the Sheep amen hallelujah so they and she understands how she needs to embrace these gifts amen because these men are packing the greatest message that will produce the greatest faith that is needed in the greatest hour to defeat Satan Satan's kingdom what kind of faith we need rapturing feet this Bride is a fruitful Vine we are not a Barren wife yes yes Hallelujah we are not a Barren wife yes Peter said told us that if these things abound in you you shall be neither Barren nor unfruitful right amen one time Sarah was a Barren wife one time Rebecca was a Barren wife one time Leah was a Barren wife one time Rachel was a Barren wife and one time this bride was a Barren wife but we thank God we are Isaac who prayed over our sin man who opened up our homes amen and we conceived of the word of God and we put into life and we are bringing life of his life Spirit of his Spirit word of his word amen amen thank you amen hallelujah amen how many of you got the Holy Spirit here this morning and if you believe you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen hallelujah then you are a fruitful lion thank you amen listen to what he says now in first Timothy 2 9 in the message to us that's the way the woman she the woman should test to be if you want to be pretty that what makes you pretty is a christ-like spirit adorned in modest apparel he says the holy spirit will make you act like the Bible make you stagger like a drunk man amen repent he the kingdom of God is at hand the Lord has sent Elijah the prophet Amen in Malachi 4 and he said if he did not send him he is going to Smite the Earth with a curse run into Christ while you can speed to the Rock Amen flee to the Ark of Safety while you can amen it'll make you happy the same way it'll make you go before Kings before people at work before your bosses and Proclaim that Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever amen it'll bring you to the fullness of the Statue of Christ he says you might shout you might speak with tongues run up and down dance in the spirits he said I've seen Hindus do that and Indians and everything else that don't mean nothing unless there's a life to back up what you're talking about power of the Holy Ghost to make Godly living people that's the bride of Christ so we're not looking for a walked up emotionalism but we are looking for people who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost who have a life to back up their jumping to back up their shouting to back up their hallelujahs all right okay am many many men but I want you to know you can't have one without the other yeah amen many many men Hallelujah he says your Esther wants was to become bride she didn't want none of the adorning of the world she wanted to go into the king just like she was she adorned themselves like the Pentecostal woman ought to I think we read that right amen now the prophet had a preview of The Bride in closing now you remember he says there I remember that night I seen the preview of the Bride I seen there there was a beautiful little lady just correctly dressed and things marching this way there was somebody standing by me in the vision there I am [Music] amen there was somebody standing by me in the vision and I seen they said the preview of the Bride I seen her go by they come on this side and went around I heard it coming church is coming up from this side become the Asian Church you talk about filth yet come the European Church all mine and then I heard rock and roll coming it was Miss America the church he didn't even have any clothes she had papers like newspapers gray hold in front of her dancing by rock and roll Miss America the church I stood there in the presence I thought oh God as a minister if that's the best we could do you know how it feels then I thought God hide me if I could just get away from here if all that we've done and that what we have to produce and then the woman passed by all doing kind of rocking things short hair painted faces and they passed by like that supposed to be virgins to Christ and when they pass by like that I turn my head you know with this holding in front of me it was disgraceful the back of him and there they was going like that and I turned my head to weeping I couldn't stand it in there him standing there and me that me a minister of the church and that's what I produced for him oh I couldn't look at that and just as soon as it went out every time one of them would come they go out a certain place then drop off and I just hear the sound as it went away then I heard something like a drum beat amen Onward Christian Soldiers marching us to war I looked and here comes that sainted bunch of little girls now before I go any further this is you the last and final group that he saw is you listen how he describes you now Saint a bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed they're hanging down way down their bed on their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the Gospel she was the word glory amen they look like one out of every nation I'm one of them one of them they had one from every nation represented there so there was a South African bride amen and by God's grace we are believing we are one of them look like one out of every nation I was looking at it as they passed by and seen them pass by and instead of going down they started going up amen we're going up to the high places going up to the high places amen we didn't drop off but we are going up I'm going up a Yonder to be with my Lord I noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying getting out of line I scream stay in line and the vision left me and I was standing in the room screaming stay in line Wonder Could it already be passed could the bride already be called is that what we're going through today now listen this is in the message the Rapture one of the few last messages he preached she has to be molded made into it the image of Christ that's the only thing it's in there it's in the word there cannot be anything added a woman with one hand like a man and the other woman with a paw like a dog it's got to be exactly word of the Lord like he is the word the bride is part of the bridegroom the woman is part of a husband so of course she's taken out of the husband he was taken was he part of Adam from his side and so is the bride not taken from a denomination but taken from the bosom of the word of God for this day amen so who were these people they're for getting out of state was it the Press Play movement was it the two Lords movement was it the note-taking communion movement okay who was getting out of Step got the prophet at the screen stay alive [Music] but like Sarah our faith we the bride have judged him faithful Amen to bring we know we are bringing to pass the promised land in our lives like Rebecca with an answer to Eliza's prayer we are the answer to Brennan's prayer we have left all that we know down in Babylon to follow Brennan to be married to Christ amen married to our Isaac which is the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah what did she do amen she got to work she got to feeding the camels and there's beasts represent a power amen and the Very power that we give water to and praise to Wanted Life praise word is the very thing that packs us into glory land to meet the bridegroom amen we are not like vasty who refuse to come out into the presence of the king amen we didn't refuse the King's Command but we are like Esther we have not spoiled our skirts with the garments of the world but we have chosen Morris the Peril of the world and we have been connected to him by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have recognized our position and our authority to come into the king's chamber for such a time as this in the hour of intercession and what is he doing he's Whispering love secrets to his lovely Queen preparing her for the final body change amen that will unite you with a king for when we shall see him we shall have a body like his own glorious body says the Bible amen who are we it needs the rising of the sun it says being the groom the bride has to come forth It's a part of him it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the Revelation that others that spoke of the Bride if he does something different from the groom it isn't the bride she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one woman taken from his side she has taken his Spirit the feminine Spirit from him

amen the same resurrection power the same healing power the same holy ghost power leads in you and I amen do you believe it this morning amen hallelujah what is it he's Whispering love secrets to his bride made only known to us by the revelation of the secret through his grace I want you to know that all eyes are upon you watching the final scene The Eyes Of Heaven the eyes of the world yes the eyes of the make-believer the eyes of the critic the eyes of the unbeliever All Eyes Are Fixed upon the bride you remember the time the bride's about to approach for the wedding he's all eyes on the room that poor guy is standing there so nervous but nobody's looking at you even the Bridesmaids are nervous they thinking everyone's looking at them the groomsmen everyone is nervous but all eyes are fixed on the bride [Music] and the music plays Here Comes the Bride Here Comes the Bride Hallelujah All Eyes Are Fixed upon the bride for the final hour as he is the king of kings she is the queen of Queens he says if you overcome you can sit with me on my throne all Heaven is cheering doesn't the Bible say we are compressed with a great cloud of witnesses saying Press On bad but brother Branham

you need is faith in God Amen we thank the Lord for being part of that queen of Queens amen we know that the churches has made Mary Queen of Heaven but we are that Queen amen we are part of that Queen by the grace of God after we've added to our faith and we become that man that God is looking that he had in the Garden of Eden before anything happened we are going back to that man amen wrote with his righteousness and I believe that all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord so Matt is not what happens to you in any circumstance God knows that you are the predestinated Son and Daughter of the Living God Amen so he can't lose you yeah there's it's impossible to lose you because you have already made it it's not something that you have to do amen God said you have already made it because he's got uh cattle on a thousand hills and you can ask anything in his name anything and I say it's like the Pastor said there's a gift out there but I want to say this the gift is right here too you know believe your past or believe the Evangelist believe anyone that stands behind the sacred desk that when he speaks the word demons are Cast Away right there and then so when he lays hands on you remember the Bible said call the Elder that's an action of Faith call me elderly you don't have to be sick you don't have to suffer all you have to do is obey the word of God Amen and when you all beat into the word of God and that's what God looks towards amen is your obedience to what he has promised and when he promises anything you can bet your bottom dollar on that and when we say about the accountancy amen the bottom dollar is the profit Hallelujah so we have eyes to see we are not blind in this real decent Church age we might have lots of money we might have big cars and houses but we need the big and lovely Lord Jesus Christ in our hearts and that's all we need amen and as long as we've got him all the other things shall be added unto you are you happy amen are you blessed amen amen I'm blessed beyond the words because of the work we had here this morning that we are part of that queen of Queens amen if you're a fingernail you're part of it amen hallelujah if you're the toenail you are part of it amen so we thank God that we are on that portion of the material that is cut for the dress code or the dress rather for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and it's predestinated for that scissor to fall on that material where God placed it before the foundation of the world and I'm happy to be part of that material how about the baptism of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah you have to testify about it amen if God gives it to you you have to tell him yes tell somebody that Jesus Christ a man that you love him with all your heart with your mind and your soul and at the end that love will pull you through any fire that the devil has to fight at you because we are the shield of faith we have the helmet of salvation we have our lord is good about the truth we have our feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all that Sheila faithful quench that fiery Dance of the wicked one amen so go home be well and know that there's nothing wrong with you there's something wrong with the devil because he's been Cast Away he's been cast out so may God bless our precious brother faster at least he live in such a wonderful message this morning the hospitality that he's given us amen my daughter my grandchildren so happy to see the latest one amen and I thank God that such a beauty to see a little angel from heaven that you can stare at the whole day tired so I'm so happy to be a proud grandfather Amen to have even my son from Johannesburg with his precious wife and knowing that I'm I feel I feel I feel okay [Music] and then it's beyond words so may God richly bless you and certainly have extended my stay and Adeline has made sure that I would stay as long as possible so I've taken down the walls of Jericho I've done this and I've done that and ticked all the boxes that had to be done so I trust in God will certainly allow us to go home and come back again rejoicing to meet up with such a lovely bunch of people because if I don't see you this time I'll be sure to meet you on the other side so keep on pressing Press On and we know that if you don't press uh that means that you are dead but the man that stumbles he will fall and if you are alive you'll get up again it's only a dead man that stays down so I pray that God will simply bless you all and pray for us and uh thank God for bringing us here safely and trust that we will go home filled with his Spirit refreshed and God bless you may want to bless you you dismiss amen until we meet till we meet until [Music] [Music]
