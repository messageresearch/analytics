[2:40] Hallelujah.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. The revealed word of the hour.
[2:45] Yes.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet says, "What a
[2:47] resurrection that was
[2:49] &gt;&gt; and what a resurrection this is
[2:51] &gt;&gt; to be quickened to life."
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody knows about this
[2:55] resurrection of the bride of the end
[2:56] time.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The lovely wife of the Lord Jesus
[2:59] Christ.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; She's sinless. She's spotless. She's
[3:03] without blame.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; She's without wrinkles, without any
[3:06] spot.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm talking about all of us.
[3:10] Amen. And our Lord Jesus Christ has done
[3:12] that when he rose triumphantly from the
[3:14] grave.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know the blood
[3:17] speaks of better things.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated for a moment.
[3:21] Greet everyone in the mighty name of our
[3:23] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to see everyone in the
[3:27] house of the Lord.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we get together like this.
[3:30] Amen. I was just thinking of the song. I
[3:32] love that thrill when I
[3:34] &gt;&gt; that I feel when I get together with
[3:37] &gt;&gt; God's wonderful people.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And can you imagine what heaven's
[3:41] going to be like?
[3:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not only going to see one
[3:44] another,
[3:45] &gt;&gt; we're going to see the saints down
[3:46] through the ages.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. People that we read about in the
[3:50] Bible, the apostles, Amen. The Apostle
[3:53] Paul and all of these seven church age
[3:55] messengers.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Do you know they are unknown to the
[3:59] church world, but the prophetic eye of
[4:01] this prophet identified each church age
[4:04] messenger.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the same way Joseph identified
[4:07] those uh brothers and he seated them
[4:09] according to Amen. the the years of
[4:12] birth,
[4:13] &gt;&gt; our prophet brought them all the way
[4:14] from Paul
[4:15] &gt;&gt; all the way up, Amen. to Wesley.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; And then identified himself in
[4:19] scripture.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; And then he also prophesied about a
[4:24] super church and a super race and an
[4:26] invincible army.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was us.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; So we are thankful. Amen. For this
[4:30] prophetic gift. If it had not been for
[4:32] the prophet, believe me, we wouldn't be
[4:34] gathered together like this. Amen.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; We will be gathered in our own
[4:37] denominations and in our own sex and our
[4:39] own way of doing things. Amen. But we
[4:42] have come under the revealed word of the
[4:43] hour.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; So always good to see our pastor Tony.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our pastor Mvin.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our pastor Leon here,
[4:52] &gt;&gt; our pastor Eshko. Amen. Let's give these
[4:54] wonderful men of God a hand. [applause]
[4:58] Praise the Lord.
[5:00] Amen. And we also want to express our
[5:02] appreciation to pastor MV for arranging
[5:05] for our pastor Moses to be here.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. To minister for us at this time.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; And we know it's ordained of the Lord.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; It has to be because scripture can't
[5:15] fail. The Bible says the footsteps of
[5:17] the righteous are ordered.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know what an order is?
[5:22] &gt;&gt; That's a military term.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the footsteps of the righteous
[5:26] are ordered of the Lord.
[5:28] So be an expectation because the captain
[5:30] of the host is here. [applause]
[5:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; And he makes all things beautiful. Amen.
[5:37] So be an expectation. And you know
[5:39] whatever you are desiring for it's in an
[5:41] unseen realm.
[5:43] &gt;&gt; But faith can reach to that unseen realm
[5:45] and pull it into the seen realm.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it takes faith.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; Faith can do impossible things.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever you're expecting the
[5:54] Lord for, Amen. Whatever you're
[5:55] believing the Lord for, believe that
[5:57] before you leave this place.
[5:59] &gt;&gt; In fact, believe right now, you have
[6:01] already received it. That the word is
[6:03] coming. I will water that by faith.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, we have some apologies.
[6:08] Amen. From our dear pastor Rodney. Amen.
[6:10] Sister Pam wasn't too well. So, he
[6:13] couldn't make it for this uh service
[6:14] this evening. So, he asked to extend his
[6:16] apologies. And he also asked the church
[6:18] to remember Sister Pam in prayer,
[6:20] &gt;&gt; which we are going to do. Amen. So,
[6:23] amen. We won't waste too much of time.
[6:24] We know our pastor Moses is no stranger
[6:27] to us.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to get him a a visa or
[6:31] what? Permanent residency here in South
[6:34] Africa.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; So it'll be easy for him to just travel
[6:37] like that.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is his second home.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the first time I saw him, I
[6:44] told him, "Welcome to the land of the
[6:45] angel of the Lord."
[6:48] &gt;&gt; I told him it's important because the
[6:50] prophet was reprimanded and he was told,
[6:52] "Get to Devon.
[6:54] Get to Durban. He was in Johannesburg.
[6:56] He was in Bloom Fontaine. But the angel
[6:58] said, "Get to
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Dan."
[7:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know when the
[7:03] prophet saw a 10 vision where he was
[7:05] looking?
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said he was taken back to this
[7:13] land.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; How many you know, the prophet says it
[7:17] could be a little black boy that's the
[7:19] last seed.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; And he says this gospel must get back to
[7:22] Africa. Amen.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; But God knows what he's doing.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are perfectly on time. So
[7:28] your pastor, welcome.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; We're under great expectation.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's no stranger to us. Also,
[7:33] thank you, Pastor Paul. Amen. For the
[7:34] songs. I mean, brother Paul, we were
[7:37] &gt;&gt; blessed with that singing. Amen. How
[7:38] many of you under expectation?
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So before we uh hand over the
[7:42] service, Amen. Let's just pray for our
[7:44] sister Pam. I believe there's enough
[7:46] faith in this room.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. and that the hand of the Lord will
[7:50] be able to touch her and deliver her
[7:52] right now.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, we're going to
[7:56] just call our pastor Tony to bring this
[7:58] request before the Lord.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want all of us to begin to
[8:02] join our faith.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible says just one of us can put a
[8:05] thousand to flightmen
[8:06] &gt;&gt; and two of us can send a legion flame.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; If two or more shall agree upon
[8:11] anything,
[8:12] &gt;&gt; shall be done. Amen. and our dear pastor
[8:13] Tony.
[8:18] Shall we pray church?
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Gracious God, eternal father,
[8:22] &gt;&gt; thank you father,
[8:23] &gt;&gt; we bow before your throne of grace,
[8:26] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[8:29] &gt;&gt; your word says that whatever we shall
[8:31] say,
[8:32] &gt;&gt; yes,
[8:32] &gt;&gt; we come tonight upon the authority of
[8:34] your word.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Father, we speak as elected sons.
[8:40] [singing]
[8:41] We speak as adopted sons.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; We bring our dear sister before you in
[8:45] the name of Jesus.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Gracious God, we know that this is the
[8:50] season
[8:51] &gt;&gt; for your bride.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; This is the season for this this
[8:57] anointed woman to speak.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; We speak strength into sister.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. Speak healing
[9:05] into sister. Father, I remember watching
[9:08] the video on Sunday when your servant
[9:10] went down and he laid hands on our
[9:12] sister and he prayed so passionately.
[9:14] Tonight, we are just joining hands in
[9:17] that prayer.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; We believe that God heard that prayer.
[9:20] We believe that God heard every other
[9:23] servant who ever prayed for Sister Bam
[9:25] because it's not the first time she's
[9:27] been prayed for. So, we are joining
[9:29] hands tonight with every other prayer.
[9:33] In the name of Jesus, we claim our
[9:35] healing because healing is the
[9:37] children's bread. And we know that
[9:40] children don't beg for pray. They take
[9:42] what has been provided by father. So
[9:45] tonight, we are accepting our healing
[9:47] because it's been provided in the name
[9:49] of Jesus.
[9:52] [applause]
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's stand as we
[9:58] receive our dear pastor. Amen. Thank
[10:00] you, Lord Jesus.
[10:02] Hallelujah.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Let's sing. I'm only in this message by
[10:06] grace.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:13] And I'm only [singing and music]
[10:16] in this message
[10:19] by grace. [music]
[10:23] [singing]
[10:26] It [music] is only
[10:29] by grace [singing and music]
[10:32] that I
[10:37] [music] know [singing]
[10:40] I know what
[10:44] I'm [music]
[10:50] [music and singing]
[10:52] in the blessing.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; [music]
[10:55] &gt;&gt; I need
[10:56] &gt;&gt; one more time. Let's sing it. I'm only
[10:58] in the [singing] message.
[11:02] [music]
[11:05] blessing [singing]
[11:07] my praise.
[11:11] [music]
[11:13] He is [singing]
[11:14] only
[11:17] my [music] praise
[11:20] that I need. [music]
[11:25] I don't know [music] how
[11:28] I chose [singing]
[11:33] [music]
[11:34] any [singing] way
[11:37] I
[11:42] [music and singing]
[11:49] [music]
[11:50] &gt;&gt; greet you in the wonderful name of Jesus
[11:52] Christ.
[11:54] Lord,
[11:54] &gt;&gt; how many men are happy with me?
[11:58] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to see my friends.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Familiar faces.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; So, we want to appreciate Pastor Adrian.
[12:08] So I did not think that I'll come back
[12:11] again
[12:12] &gt;&gt; before pastor Adrian comes with him
[12:17] &gt;&gt; because as human beings I had arranged
[12:21] for pastor Adrian to come end of
[12:23] October.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; So I spoke to the church. I also spoke
[12:28] to some pastors because my intention was
[12:32] to revenge.
[12:34] So I had lined up many sermons, many
[12:39] churches. So then it did not work out.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Not that there was politics or what. But
[12:48] at work, he could not be granted leave.
[12:52] But everything was. But I said, "No, you
[12:54] are still not off the hook. We will try
[12:58] next year." Amen.
[13:00] So because I was there when pastor
[13:03] Adrian preached at East Taberno the
[13:06] church of former of pastor chaser. So it
[13:10] was such a blessing.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; So you people you are so privileged.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Is it you brother Luke?
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So you people you are so
[13:19] privileged to have a pastor like pastor
[13:22] Adrian.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; Such a gifted man of God. Wonderful
[13:26] spirit. And this time
[13:31] it was pastor me.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Who brought me here because I had come
[13:37] to for the funeral of pastor.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; So then pastor
[13:43] me hallelujah
[13:45] organized for me to be down here. So may
[13:48] God brother may God bless pastor me. How
[13:52] many love pastor me?
[13:55] &gt;&gt; He's a kind gentleman. [applause]
[13:57] Hallelujah.
[13:59] He's a straightforward person.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He does not indicate right
[14:04] and turn left.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[14:08] &gt;&gt; He means what he says and he says what
[14:10] he means.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; And I'm happy to see Pastor Tony. Thank
[14:13] you for the prayer. Pastor Tony is also
[14:16] a bosome friend of mine.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; So I I also saw Pastor Eshko.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Pastor Eshko.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; And if I leave out some pastors, oh my
[14:30] friend, brother Adrian, are you there?
[14:33] He's also a friend. Hallelujah. So,
[14:36] without wasting much time, h let's read
[14:39] 2 Corinthians chapter 2. I'll try not to
[14:43] be long.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Is it still okay?
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I think Are we hearing one
[14:52] another?
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. So we can still continue before we
[14:56] sit down. 2 Corinthians chapter 2. 2
[14:59] Corinthians chapter 2.
[15:03] 2 Corinthians chapter 2.
[15:06] God bless you Pastor Tony
[15:09] verse 11.
[15:12] Let's just read verse 11. I also see the
[15:16] sister elder sister for pastor Ho. When
[15:19] I came for the first time from the
[15:21] airport, I went to brother Esho's house
[15:24] and she was there
[15:25] &gt;&gt; and she really took care took care of
[15:28] me. May God bless you my sister. So
[15:31] second 2 Corinthians
[15:35] 2:1 the Bible says lest Satan should get
[15:42] in advantage of us
[15:45] &gt;&gt; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; How many appreciate that?
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Can I read it again?
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lest Satan should get an advantage
[15:57] of us
[15:59] &gt;&gt; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; We may be seated. You know h I was
[16:09] battling
[16:10] uh of what to preach. Pastor me, I did
[16:15] not know, you know, it's not easy to
[16:20] to come and stand before God's children.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; So, you want to make sure, Pastor Tony,
[16:27] that you are in the will of God.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Bible says, "A word
[16:33] spoken in due season, how good it is."
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A word spoken in juices in
[16:41] brother how good it is.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; So brother Adrian that one who
[16:46] fellowships with pastor me my friend we
[16:48] met him yesterday. God bless you. So how
[16:52] many have prayed for me?
[16:54] &gt;&gt; My desire I always want to be a
[16:57] blessing.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[16:59] &gt;&gt; So me coming here to preach to youh it
[17:03] does not mean that I know more than
[17:06] pastor Adrian. I know more than pastors
[17:09] in De say are we together we are just
[17:12] here for fellowship
[17:14] &gt;&gt; that's why I also want to invite some of
[17:19] you are we together to also come and
[17:21] preach for us
[17:23] &gt;&gt; because I am not a messenger we that you
[17:27] always come you want to preach alone no
[17:30] you know there are some pastors like
[17:31] that that they always just go and preach
[17:34] to others but they themselves they don't
[17:37] believe that someone can teach them.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; It's not the spirit of Christ.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; We are not ignorant of his devices.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Even pastor me, I believe that he has
[17:48] got something that he can help me as
[17:50] well.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; So the Lord giving us grace. Even pastor
[17:54] Tony has got something that he can
[17:56] preach for us.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together friends?
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Because iron sharpened iron.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we you know brother Brhamam
[18:06] said when he used to preach he would
[18:08] preach one message.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; So brother Neville would preach one
[18:12] message and brother Brham would get
[18:13] inspiration
[18:15] &gt;&gt; for 10 message
[18:17] &gt;&gt; 10 messages out of one sermon that was
[18:20] preached by brother Neville.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; You remember when he spoke about the
[18:23] restoration to say to restore
[18:26] &gt;&gt; brotherham took it from brother Neville.
[18:30] So can you imagine a prophet, he would
[18:32] also sit down and hear other preachers
[18:36] preaching. Oh,
[18:37] &gt;&gt; that's the spirit of Christ.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you. So I just want to read
[18:46] a quotation here. I don't have many
[18:50] quotations. It's a familiar one where
[18:52] I'll get my my message in the exposition
[18:55] of the seven church edges.
[18:58] He says here,
[19:00] I think you can just pick it up. You
[19:02] know it.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; So when I say a quotation that you know,
[19:06] don't worry because Jesus used to say,
[19:09] "Verily, verily, I say unto you."
[19:12] &gt;&gt; So if I read this quotation and you know
[19:14] it, you must know it's the second.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; This what I'm reading is the second
[19:19] what? Because Jesus always said,
[19:21] "Verily, verily, I say unto you."
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Pastor me, may God bless you. He says,
[19:28] "Now, Brother Brandham says right down
[19:31] to the time he is cast into the lake of
[19:34] fire." I just put it. I just He says he
[19:37] fights that.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; So, the devil fights Revelation.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; So, that's what he's talking about.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; The devil has two books.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; The book of Genesis and the book of
[19:49] Revelation.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Because the book of Genesis shows us how
[19:53] he began. Yeah.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[19:56] &gt;&gt; His deception.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; And the book of Revelation shows us his
[20:01] end.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; How he's going to be thrown into the
[20:04] lake of fire.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; So the devil hates two books.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; So we thank God because of revelation.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; Don't underestimate the power of
[20:18] revelation.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together, friends? In as much as
[20:22] we can pray, in as much as we can fast,
[20:25] but we defeat the devil by revelation.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; If you don't know who you are, the devil
[20:31] take advantage.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; If you don't know the devil's devices,
[20:36] &gt;&gt; you will be defeated.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW how the devil operates.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; So I'll be preaching on those lines.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; How many can say brother Andrew?
[20:48] So, brother Brandham says, "Brother
[20:49] Luke, we must know,
[20:51] &gt;&gt; are we together? How the devil operates
[20:56] &gt;&gt; in the message, [clears throat]
[20:58] you know, contest."
[21:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "You must know whether he uses
[21:02] the right hand or the left hand."
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, if you don't know how the
[21:08] devil operates, you will be in trouble.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[21:15] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Esho, do you see? We must
[21:19] know in the contest because you cannot
[21:22] go into war
[21:24] &gt;&gt; without studying the Amen.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Pastor, YOU MUST STUDY WHAT? YOUR enemy
[21:31] &gt;&gt; and you know how he maneuvers, how he
[21:35] does his things. So when you hear Paul
[21:37] say we are not ignorant of his devices.
[21:41] So it means you must know
[21:45] &gt;&gt; the tactics of the devil.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul will come and say the
[21:50] devil
[21:51] &gt;&gt; is he has transformed himself
[21:55] &gt;&gt; as an angel of light.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; He is roaring like a lion.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; BUT HE IS NOT A LION.
[22:05] SO MY FRIENDS, in as much as we can
[22:08] fast,
[22:09] &gt;&gt; in as much as we can pray, are we
[22:11] together? And we don't know how the
[22:14] devil operates, are we together? We will
[22:17] always be on the losing side.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; That's why even people who play soccer,
[22:22] are we together?
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Before they go to a a soccer major, are
[22:27] we together? Like when South Africa is
[22:29] playing against Zimbabwe,
[22:31] &gt;&gt; the coach of South Africa will take the
[22:34] videos of the Zimbabwean players to see
[22:37] their strength, to see their weaknesses,
[22:40] to see the danger and they study them
[22:44] &gt;&gt; so that when they come now to play that
[22:46] they'll be knowing how many you can say
[22:49] to avoid whether the counter attacks or
[22:51] whatever they will study the enemy. So
[22:55] you you cannot just go into this great
[22:57] warfare without knowing the devil,
[23:00] &gt;&gt; without knowing how we attack.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; So when you know
[23:07] &gt;&gt; to be for to be forewarned is to be for
[23:10] armed.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; How many have seen that?
[23:14] &gt;&gt; We are in war.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; So today we want to see.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me read quickly.
[23:22] God bless you. And I feel here that you
[23:25] are a well taught church.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[23:28] &gt;&gt; You know exactly what I'm saying.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he says here, let's go
[23:33] quickly. He says
[23:36] he knows that if the people get the true
[23:39] revelation of the true church and what
[23:42] she is
[23:44] &gt;&gt; ah what she stands for and and she
[23:48] cannot do. It says what she stands for
[23:51] and that she can do the greater works.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; So you need revelation to know that you
[23:58] can do the greater works.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; So then he says she will be an
[24:05] invincible army.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; How are we going to be an invincible
[24:08] army?
[24:09] &gt;&gt; The revelation of knowing who we are
[24:12] [laughter]
[24:14] &gt;&gt; and who the enemy is. And I want to tell
[24:16] you friends, do you see that the rider
[24:19] is only one rider?
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[24:22] &gt;&gt; He changed. He started on a white horse.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; From the white horse, he jumped to the
[24:27] red horse. From the red horse, he jumped
[24:30] to the black horse.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Then the fourth stage, it was a pale
[24:35] horse.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; A mixture. Are we together?
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Of white, red, and black. And we know
[24:42] that when he was only what? on a white
[24:45] horse. The devil was using religious
[24:48] power.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? [laughter]
[24:51] &gt;&gt; The devil was using what? Religious
[24:53] power.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Pastor me. And then he saw that people
[24:58] discovered him. Then he dumped into a
[25:01] red horse.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; He was now changing tactics. He was now
[25:05] using political power. He was now
[25:08] holding assault.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; BUT IS THE SAME DEVIL.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together? When the B the prophet
[25:15] tells us that when the enemy comes in
[25:17] like a flood,
[25:19] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God [laughter] raises a
[25:21] standard.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; So when the devil came on a white horse
[25:25] using religious power,
[25:28] &gt;&gt; God raised an anointing of a lion
[25:32] &gt;&gt; to combat religious power.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; And the DEVIL JUMPED AS WELL. ARE WE
[25:38] TOGETHER into the red horse? He was now
[25:41] using political power. God raised the
[25:44] standard in the form of an ox.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To combat political power.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; And when THE DEVIL WAS DEFEATED, HE CAME
[25:54] using a black horse
[25:57] for a penny. Are we together? How many
[25:59] remember that?
[26:01] &gt;&gt; And God raised a standard.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; IN THE FORM OF A MAN. YES.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; So this is these are the days now of
[26:08] Martin Luther when they interpreted the
[26:11] Bible. So they were defeated the devil
[26:14] by revelation
[26:15] &gt;&gt; by the word.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; And then the devil saw that hey I'm
[26:21] being defeated. And then on that fourth
[26:23] stage now it was now a mixture.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen?
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Of white, red and black. a mixture of
[26:33] religious power, political power and
[26:36] demon power. It was now dead. [laughter]
[26:40] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[26:42] &gt;&gt; And God raised a standard.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen?
[26:46] &gt;&gt; IN THE FORM OF AN EGO,
[26:50] &gt;&gt; so you and me, we are under the ego
[26:53] anointing.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And I want to tell you
[26:57] my friend, I used to think that the
[27:01] believers
[27:02] who were in years gone by in the days of
[27:06] of Job, in the days of the Old
[27:09] Testament, Abraham, Solomon, David, I
[27:12] used to think that, how many can say
[27:14] amen?
[27:15] &gt;&gt; They are so powerful
[27:17] &gt;&gt; than we.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Brother, I used to think that David hear
[27:22] me. Don't take me for what I I say. Take
[27:25] me for what I mean.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know that this brother here is
[27:29] more powerful than Solomon?
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you
[27:35] &gt;&gt; we are in the greatest battle that has
[27:38] ever been fought.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; WE IN THE GREATEST BATTLE.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN you hear says HELL IS ON EARTH.
[27:47] IF WE go to hell right now, there's no
[27:49] demons because THE LID OF HELL HAS BEEN
[27:53] OPENED. AMEN.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Do you hear my brother
[27:58] &gt;&gt; and we ARE WE ARE FELLOWSHIPPING you
[28:00] know we are going to school with demons.
[28:03] We are working with demons. It's hell
[28:06] all over.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Do you hear?
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Run for your life.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Hell is on the
[28:13] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? So I want you to
[28:15] see why I said this brother is powerful.
[28:18] Amen.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; The believers of the of the days of of
[28:23] the white horse rider,
[28:24] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[28:25] &gt;&gt; They were contending with only religious
[28:28] power.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying?
[28:31] &gt;&gt; But pastor Maven and Pastor Adrian and
[28:35] me and Pastor Tony, we are now
[28:38] contending with all the demons
[28:42] &gt;&gt; that they fought in those ages. All the
[28:46] demons which were fighting Paul, the
[28:49] demons in the dark ages, they've all
[28:52] conglomerated, united
[28:54] &gt;&gt; to fight us.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying?
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Others were just fighting political
[29:00] power.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; In the days of the white horse,
[29:03] &gt;&gt; in the days of the black horse, they
[29:05] were just fighting demon power. But you
[29:09] and me,
[29:10] &gt;&gt; we are fighting religious power,
[29:13] political power AND DEMON POWER.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; SO God trusted brother Edin, trusted my
[29:20] friend here, trusted brother Luke to be
[29:23] in this age.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Are you here?
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Listen, the best runners,
[29:31] &gt;&gt; yes,
[29:31] &gt;&gt; they are put in the beginning and in the
[29:34] end.
[29:35] When people play when people running for
[29:38] the best runner is in the beginning and
[29:42] the RACE
[29:44] &gt;&gt; THOSE WHO ARE IN BETWEEN they are
[29:46] average.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Why do they put the first runner in the
[29:49] beginning so that he can open the gap?
[29:52] HE CAN LEAVE THE COMPETITORS OPEN A big
[29:55] gap and then maybe the number two or
[29:58] number three when they slow down a
[30:00] little bit and the enemy catches up the
[30:03] last one
[30:04] &gt;&gt; we take the patterns there
[30:06] &gt;&gt; and finish them touch
[30:11] &gt;&gt; so we now
[30:13] &gt;&gt; but it's not easy
[30:15] &gt;&gt; to be a minister
[30:17] &gt;&gt; in the bride age and in the last age
[30:22] &gt;&gt; where there is A MIXTURE OF POLITICAL
[30:24] POWER, DEMON POWER. HOW MANY CAN SAY
[30:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN?
[30:29] &gt;&gt; AND RELIGIOUS POWER.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; It's not easy.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; So God said whom can I send
[30:36] &gt;&gt; in the last chapter.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[30:41] &gt;&gt; And God said pastor let him go and
[30:42] preach.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; God trusted you.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Father, do you know that even women? How
[30:48] many can say amen? In the days of
[30:50] brother Brham, he said, "Hey, the
[30:52] flashing red lights of the son of his
[30:54] coming." He says, "Do you know that the
[30:57] beauty of women, it's a sign?" How many
[31:00] can say it's a flashing red light of his
[31:03] coming?
[31:04] &gt;&gt; So, brother days, he was saying the the
[31:08] Miss America of today.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[31:10] &gt;&gt; how many you can't compare with the Miss
[31:13] America of long day?
[31:15] &gt;&gt; So, what about now? Amen.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; When you see the beauty of women and God
[31:21] trusted you brother to [clears throat]
[31:23] stay in this age [laughter]
[31:25] &gt;&gt; where you can't hardly find an ugly
[31:27] woman and God says go stay there go
[31:30] worship there.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Solomon
[31:34] &gt;&gt; who had 1,000 wives?
[31:37] &gt;&gt; If Solomon had an iPhone with internet,
[31:42] he was going to fall. God did not
[31:46] but God trusted brother but God trusted
[31:50] pastor Tony someone IS SAYING NO I'M
[31:52] TELLING YOU THE TRUTH
[31:55] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT CHEAP
[31:57] &gt;&gt; EVEN MYSELF I know TO PREACH HOW MANY
[32:00] CAN say amen in this end time in the
[32:03] greatest OF BATTLES SO IT MEANS GOD HAS
[32:07] TRUSTED you
[32:09] &gt;&gt; can someone say
[32:10] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[32:13] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT CHEAP.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; EVEN you sisters, can I give you the
[32:17] quotation for that? Brother Brham says,
[32:20] "You sisters, you what sisters, do you
[32:23] realize that your daughters are
[32:25] receiving 10 times temptations
[32:28] &gt;&gt; than you were?" Can you imagine you
[32:30] mothers?
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Hey, with all the internet, with all
[32:34] these things. So our daughters of today,
[32:38] my brother, they are facing a lot than
[32:41] what you mothers face. Yes.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; So, but it shows if you are a young man
[32:47] listening to me, you must thank God that
[32:49] God trusts you
[32:52] &gt;&gt; in this age
[32:54] &gt;&gt; with all the entertainment with all the
[32:56] world. God has brought you here
[32:59] &gt;&gt; because the best one is saved at the
[33:02] end.
[33:04] Hallelujah. [cheering]
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine David who fell with Ba
[33:10] if he stayed and lived in in Phoenix?
[33:12] Uhhuh. My brother. [laughter]
[33:15] My brother. Yes. I'm unapologetic. I
[33:19] mean what I say. How many can say amen?
[33:22] I want to show you that the best one is
[33:24] saved at the end. And the devil is so
[33:28] vicious in this end time.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; He knows HIS TIME IS UP.
[33:34] DO YOU UNDERSTAND? IT'S NOT EASY. We are
[33:36] LIVING IN A TERRIBLE hour
[33:40] &gt;&gt; where we need the word of God
[33:43] &gt;&gt; to stabilize us.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[33:46] &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD IS OUR DEFENSE.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Can someone say hallelujah?
[33:52] &gt;&gt; SO WE MUST KNOW the tactics of the
[33:55] devil.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Pastor, how many are enjoying that?
[34:01] Amen.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Have you seen that
[34:04] &gt;&gt; pastor Adrian is powerful?
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm being honest
[34:09] &gt;&gt; that the pastor's gone by in ages gone
[34:12] by cuz what we are facing, what pastor
[34:15] me is facing is too much
[34:19] &gt;&gt; compared to the pastors gone by in the
[34:22] dark ages and things. So when you see
[34:24] Malachi 4, he was so powerful. God
[34:27] trusted him to STAY TO COME AND PREACH
[34:31] in the Laudian church age
[34:34] &gt;&gt; where IT WAS SO EVIL.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Ah my brothers
[34:40] &gt;&gt; I did not go I did not want to go into
[34:42] that but it's in line with what we are
[34:44] saying. How many are being blessed?
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; So how many are going to read the word?
[34:51] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us that you are as
[34:53] strong as the amount of word that is in
[34:56] you.
[34:58] You are as strong as the amount of word
[35:01] that is in you.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; So you must eat the book.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Someone you know was sick. Someone was
[35:11] sick. They took him to many doctors
[35:13] &gt;&gt; and then they could not diagnose what
[35:15] was the problem. Then they took him to
[35:17] an old experienced veteran. Can someone
[35:20] say amen?
[35:21] &gt;&gt; The veteran just asked him one question.
[35:23] in this talk says my friend when last
[35:25] did you eat a real meal?
[35:28] &gt;&gt; He said 3 days ago that doctor said you
[35:31] are not sick you are just hungry.
[35:34] [laughter] Doctor said okay do you have
[35:35] a wife? Says yes. Says let him go let
[35:39] her cook for you a real biryani a real
[35:42] nice one or you can just take a bunny a
[35:45] big one and eat it. You'll be okay. And
[35:48] then when he took the bunny he was okay.
[35:51] He was up and about. So but he had
[35:54] symptoms you know of being sick but he
[35:56] was not sick brother he was. So when you
[35:58] see brothers and sisters in [laughter]
[36:01] the message with symptoms of missing
[36:04] service being by small demons and how
[36:08] many can say amen
[36:12] just ask them when when did you
[36:20] last did you really pray
[36:23] &gt;&gt; pastors hear me pastor
[36:26] when you see brothers and sisters in the
[36:28] church which are so problematic. Just
[36:32] ask them when last did you eat a real
[36:36] meal?
[36:37] &gt;&gt; When last did you listen to the tape?
[36:39] When last did you read the Bible? WHEN
[36:41] LAST DID YOU REALLY FAST? HOW MANY SAY
[36:44] AMEN?
[36:44] &gt;&gt; So if you are like that, I'm giving you
[36:46] the prescription. You are not sick. Go
[36:48] eat.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; How many?
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; And people are not sick. How many tell
[36:58] your neighbor you are not seeking
[37:00] &gt;&gt; you are just hungry.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; How many say amen?
[37:04] &gt;&gt; You need spiritual food in [laughter]
[37:06] juices.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; There were two dogs which were fighting.
[37:11] Two dogs were fighting. Are we together?
[37:13] The black one and the white one.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; And the the the black one was always
[37:18] being defeated. How many can say amen?
[37:21] &gt;&gt; And then they asked why is it this one
[37:22] is winning the white one? They said,
[37:24] "Ah,
[37:26] it's always being fed. [clears throat]
[37:28] It's always fed. It's always eating."
[37:30] How many can say amen?
[37:32] &gt;&gt; So listen, someone asked brother
[37:34] Brandham, Pastor Ishko, he says, "Pen of
[37:37] God, what must I do so that I become
[37:40] spiritual? I want to be spiritual."
[37:42] Brother Brham said, "Read the Bible and
[37:45] pray every day."
[37:48] &gt;&gt; The ingredients. [cheering]
[37:50] If [applause] you want to be spiritual,
[37:51] read your Bible
[37:53] &gt;&gt; every day.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, you think uh a part-time
[38:00] Christian can defeat a full-time demon.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Forget demons ARE FULLTIME.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY CAN say amen?
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; I want to say, Pastor Tony, a part-time
[38:11] Christian will never defeat a full-time
[38:14] demon.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Demons are fulltime.
[38:18] Tell your neighbor and say you must be
[38:19] full time this morning
[38:21] &gt;&gt; in the way of God.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; You must be full time
[38:26] &gt;&gt; fasting
[38:27] &gt;&gt; reading. Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; When you are on internet utilize it when
[38:31] you're on YouTube to hear the word when
[38:34] you're on Facebook, WHEN YOU'RE IN
[38:35] TWITTER, USE ALL THE SOCIAL PLATFORMS.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord
[38:41] &gt;&gt; for the word.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed? Yeah.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; How many are going to eat double?
[38:50] &gt;&gt; You need to eat
[38:52] &gt;&gt; so that you become strong.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; You develop spiritual muscles.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; You are as strong as the amount of word
[39:00] that is in you.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Even Satan when he came to fight Jesus,
[39:05] Jesus did not use any of his gift.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; He said it is written.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; He used the water. Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Can I read quickly? Don't worry.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Today I don't want corruption today.
[39:21] But how many are being blessed so far?
[39:24] &gt;&gt; You people are wonderful people. May God
[39:26] bless you. Amen. Listen, let's finish
[39:29] this quotation. So he says if they can
[39:32] get a true revelation of the two spirit,
[39:36] this is where this is my message now. He
[39:39] says if they can get a true revelation.
[39:44] Okay, let's start here. He says what she
[39:46] stands for and that she can do the
[39:49] greater works. Is that right?
[39:51] &gt;&gt; She will be an invincible army. Then he
[39:54] says if they can if they get a true
[39:59] revelation of the two spirits
[40:04] &gt;&gt; within the framework
[40:08] &gt;&gt; within the framework of the Christian
[40:11] church
[40:12] &gt;&gt; and by God's spirit
[40:15] &gt;&gt; design and withstand the antichrist
[40:19] spirit. So I just want to give a title,
[40:21] small one.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Discerning the two spirits,
[40:26] &gt;&gt; working in the framework of the
[40:29] Christian church. How many can say amen?
[40:32] &gt;&gt; That's so important.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; That's why the devil is doing as he
[40:36] please
[40:37] &gt;&gt; because we can't discern
[40:39] &gt;&gt; the two spirits that are working in the
[40:42] framework of the Christian
[40:44] [clears throat] church.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Amen.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you friends that devil
[40:50] pastor me
[40:53] operates the way the devil operates. He
[40:56] operates by infiltration.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[41:02] &gt;&gt; The devil destroys us
[41:05] &gt;&gt; from within.
[41:07] That's why Paul says there are someh
[41:11] who have crept in among unaware
[41:14] &gt;&gt; to spy our labor.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Then he says there are some I don't know
[41:19] how they were. They seemed somewhat to
[41:22] me. How many can say but they profited
[41:25] nothing.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; There are some people who seem somewhat.
[41:29] How many have seen such brothers
[41:30] &gt;&gt; that you know can I want to be honest
[41:33] today? You
[41:35] &gt;&gt; you are a child of God. How many can say
[41:37] amen?
[41:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about you.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; We are talking about the devil. Do you
[41:43] hear sister?
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Paul says we must discern.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; The two spirits which are working in the
[41:50] framework of the Christian Christian
[41:53] church.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Brother look. Are you ready for this?
[41:56] &gt;&gt; How many are ready for this quotation?
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Can I read this quote?
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; I hope I won't be stoned. How many can
[42:05] say amen
[42:07] &gt;&gt; in the message
[42:10] power of transformation.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Hey Pastor Adrian, may God bless you.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; You know I was saying what must I
[42:17] preach?
[42:18] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that the devil
[42:21] right now as I continue is done with the
[42:24] be is done with the soccer stadiums and
[42:28] rugby fields. is done with the brothel
[42:31] and cinemas and beer.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; If you are looking for the devil,
[42:37] &gt;&gt; don't go to the beer house.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Don't go to the protest. Don't go to the
[42:41] nightclubs.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; The devil,
[42:44] &gt;&gt; he comes in church. Yeah.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you my friend,
[42:51] &gt;&gt; listen,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; the spirit will be so close
[42:55] &gt;&gt; that if it were possible,
[42:57] &gt;&gt; it will deceive the very elect.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Can I say, brother Luke?
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Me, can I shock you?
[43:04] &gt;&gt; It will take a pastor to deceive another
[43:07] pastor.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; It takes a prophet to deceive another
[43:10] prophet.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; It takes a sister to deceive another
[43:14] sister. It takes hallelujah
[43:18] &gt;&gt; a brother to deceive another brother.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; I cannot be deceived by bush.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; I cannot be deceived by Joshua. No, no,
[43:27] no, no. I can be deceived by someone who
[43:30] says he's in the message.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Putting a pillar of fire,
[43:35] &gt;&gt; putting pillars of fires and everything
[43:37] and saying shalom, shalom. How many can
[43:40] say I'm being honest?
[43:43] BUT YET IT'S THE DEVIL.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; DO YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?
[43:47] &gt;&gt; The devil is inside.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor and say it's not you,
[43:53] but it's being referred to. You are not
[43:55] the devil that I'm talking about. But
[43:57] you will see what I'm saying. Hey,
[43:58] brother. Can I be honest with you?
[44:02] [clears throat]
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Most of my hardest times
[44:06] &gt;&gt; in the ministry, I say this so bad.
[44:09] I was not I did not receive it from
[44:12] drunkards.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Do you hear what I'm saying?
[44:16] &gt;&gt; My most terrible moment I received in
[44:19] religion, it was in the message
[44:24] &gt;&gt; brother. Do you hear what I'm saying?
[44:26] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the devil uses
[44:29] infiltration.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; He comes in the framework.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Sometimes I am more
[44:37] comfortable with Pentecostal pastors
[44:40] than message pastors because message
[44:42] pastors will finish you. Can you say
[44:44] amen?
[44:46] &gt;&gt; I thank God for pastor Adrian, Pastor
[44:49] Johnny. Do you do you know why I also
[44:51] come here? Because I know that they love
[44:53] me because there are others who want to
[44:56] finish me.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; So you must go where you are
[44:59] appreciated, not where you are
[45:01] tolerated.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; How many I'm being honest? Amen.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Who killed? Who killed Jesus?
[45:10] &gt;&gt; It was not prostitute.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus was comfortable with prostitute.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Those who killed him. It was pastors. It
[45:17] was religious people.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; You must
[45:23] have two spirits which are working in
[45:26] the [applause and cheering] framework.
[45:28] Do you think you are outside? NO. FORGET
[45:33] THE DEVIL IS INSIDE.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL COMES
[45:38] &gt;&gt; IN THE REVEALED WORD.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE REVEALED WORD IS, THAT'S WHERE
[45:43] THE DEVIL COMES
[45:44] &gt;&gt; IN THE FRAMEWORK.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; CAN SOMEONE say amen?
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you the truth, the sons of
[45:52] God, they came, pastor me, to present
[45:54] themselves before the Lord.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; And the devil came right there.
[46:00] You think he was in the P
[46:03] &gt;&gt; right there?
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Can someone say
[46:08] &gt;&gt; where did sin start?
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Where did sin start?
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Sin did not start in the world or in the
[46:16] ship beings. Sin started in heaven.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; How many can say
[46:26] &gt;&gt; hallelujah?
[46:28] You see, but today I promise you, how
[46:31] many can say amen? I'm watching my time
[46:34] because I fear corruption. How many can
[46:36] say amen?
[46:37] &gt;&gt; And if I quickly finish, I don't blame
[46:40] Pastor Adrian
[46:42] &gt;&gt; because Pastor Ed never told me time
[46:45] &gt;&gt; to say preach for 1 hour or what, I
[46:48] won't abuse that one.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you tell your preacher
[46:52] take your time, ah, you will see 11:00.
[46:55] Then shall we continue [laughter]
[46:57] but look so I don't want to abuse the
[47:00] lians
[47:01] &gt;&gt; don't worry we will still be gone but
[47:03] [clears throat] how many are enjoying
[47:05] &gt;&gt; how many are enjoying
[47:07] &gt;&gt; you will see what I want to say
[47:09] &gt;&gt; but brother is who had a wife with a
[47:13] birthday
[47:15] yeah yeah is that your wife
[47:18] &gt;&gt; yeah I remember when we came there bless
[47:20] you yes so listen pastor me in the
[47:25] message power of transformation. We are
[47:28] moving so well. I'm watching my time.
[47:30] How many are happy so far?
[47:33] &gt;&gt; How many mean you say a little bit?
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[47:37] &gt;&gt; You must mean what you say [laughter]
[47:39] and say what you mean
[47:42] pastor.
[47:45] Amen. But there's something which I want
[47:47] to say pastor me. Is it right now? And I
[47:52] want to tell you that the people that
[47:55] fights you,
[47:56] &gt;&gt; the people that wants to destroy you,
[47:58] it's people who are so close to you.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; How many can say it? You're going to see
[48:04] that principle. Maybe before I do this,
[48:07] can I read is h let's read h proverbs
[48:13] chapter 17. Just want to go quickly.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know pastor Adrian is a great
[48:19] teacher. is going to take this as well
[48:21] and expound it. So, God bless you,
[48:24] Pastor Adrian. I am so free here.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; So, it's Proverbs chapter uh 17 verse
[48:31] 17. Listen to this. The Bible says, "A
[48:34] friend
[48:35] &gt;&gt; loveth at all times, and a brother is
[48:40] born for adversity."
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Do you see my brother, my sister? A
[48:46] brother is born for
[48:49] &gt;&gt; who sold Joseph to Egypt.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; A brother is born for
[48:57] &gt;&gt; who killed Jesus.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Was it prostitutes?
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Was it drunkards?
[49:03] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about discerning the two
[49:06] spirits working in the framework of the
[49:09] Christian church. Don't look at the
[49:12] devil
[49:13] &gt;&gt; outside.
[49:15] Wait,
[49:17] wait, wait, wait. He says here, when I
[49:21] go home, how many can say amen
[49:24] &gt;&gt; in the message, the power of
[49:26] transformation 65 10:31, this is where I
[49:30] took my inspiration. Pastor Maven, he
[49:32] says paragraph 136, I know he says this
[49:36] in many quotations. He says, "When I go
[49:39] home this time, I'm preaching on the
[49:42] subject the trail of the serpent."
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[49:47] &gt;&gt; the trail of
[49:49] &gt;&gt; it says the beast at the beginning.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; And the beast at the end.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; So you see that the beast was operating
[49:59] in the beginning and he says the beast
[50:02] in the end.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; He says and the beast at the end and he
[50:08] says and trail him
[50:10] &gt;&gt; right through the Bible.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; So this is where I got my inspiration to
[50:16] see we want to see how the devil
[50:18] operates.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; He says through the training through the
[50:22] [clears throat] Bible
[50:24] &gt;&gt; and show how he heads up.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; I mean do you see that? You must study
[50:30] your enemy. Amen.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; You must study the devil.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, the devil will have an
[50:36] advantage over you. You must know how.
[50:39] Listen, when you hear when we talk about
[50:42] the antichrist,
[50:44] &gt;&gt; if I can ask someone here, what is the
[50:46] antichrist? You know, you know,
[50:48] sometimes friends, I know it's good like
[50:51] to come and say, receive your desires,
[50:54] receive your car, receive fees, but once
[50:57] in a while, we must also teach these
[50:59] things. Amen. How many can say amen?
[51:02] &gt;&gt; To to to establish us,
[51:05] &gt;&gt; pastor me.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you,
[51:08] &gt;&gt; you will, you know, there are some
[51:09] people don't be like, you know, that
[51:11] paper fire. How many can say amen?
[51:14] &gt;&gt; That when you light a paper fire, it can
[51:16] it can quickly light off. How many can
[51:19] say amen?
[51:20] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we have to be grounded.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Have you seen that the churches that are
[51:25] well taught, how many can say amen, they
[51:28] overcome the devil. Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; They are solid.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; There's no doctrine, false doctrine that
[51:35] can come.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Do you hear what I'm saying?
[51:37] &gt;&gt; But otherwise, sometimes people just
[51:39] jump up and down and what when strange
[51:41] strange doctrine comes, it takes them.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; But when you see people who are solid,
[51:48] people who are taught, how many can say
[51:50] amen? Brother Brandham says teaching
[51:53] establishes
[51:55] the believer and shows him his rightful
[51:59] position.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Says teaching
[52:03] &gt;&gt; goes beyond
[52:05] &gt;&gt; preaching.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Brother, do you hear what I'm saying?
[52:08] &gt;&gt; THAT I CAN EVANGELIZE AND YOU CAN JUMP
[52:11] UP AND DOWN. But when pastor comes
[52:15] &gt;&gt; establishing you in the faith by the
[52:18] word
[52:20] I can see people are happy. Now listen I
[52:23] always say to my church
[52:26] &gt;&gt; many people when you say receive your
[52:27] house receive your car receive your
[52:30] healing people jump and reach the
[52:31] ceiling.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Do you hear? But when you come now and
[52:34] say the seventh seal brings him back on
[52:38] earth, they look at you.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; The same way you jump when you are given
[52:45] a car, when you are given a house,
[52:48] &gt;&gt; you must also make a lot of noise.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Just giving about adoption.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; That's a real believer.
[53:02] Because the power is in the word.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Are you preaching
[53:08] right now?
[53:09] &gt;&gt; This thing that what I'm preaching, how
[53:12] many can say amen?
[53:14] &gt;&gt; You will find yourself healed.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; You will find yourself at a place.
[53:18] [cheering] You find yourself set free.
[53:21] Brother Luke,
[53:23] &gt;&gt; can someone show me
[53:24] &gt;&gt; where brother showered John Shar
[53:28] &gt;&gt; and say, "Brother John Shar, receive
[53:30] your millions." Can anyone show me where
[53:33] brotherham said that? But brother Brham
[53:36] said, John Shar came to the meeting. He
[53:39] did not have children. He was poor. HE
[53:42] WAS GETTING 20 CENTS AN HOUR TO BUST
[53:45] CONCRETE. and he he came and believed
[53:50] every word that I preached.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; So what made John Shar to be a
[53:57] millionaire? He believed the word.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU HEAR PASTOR PREACHING THE
[54:06] DEEP MESSAGES the word, it [laughter] is
[54:10] an indirect way of showering you.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; How many?
[54:14] &gt;&gt; How many? Amen.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; There is no way when we preach the word,
[54:21] you will go back the same.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; How many can say
[54:27] &gt;&gt; I was talking one time with Pastor
[54:28] Adrian. I'm telling you that when we
[54:31] preach the word, the signs and miracles
[54:34] and wonders will follow.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[54:41] &gt;&gt; And it is it [laughter] is the season
[54:43] now.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. We can't just continue coming and
[54:47] say brother Brham says brotherham SAYS
[54:50] BROTHERHAM SAYS NO.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO SEE THE MANIFESTATION of what
[54:55] brother say
[54:58] &gt;&gt; and WE WON'T STEER YOUR EMOTIONS.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; IT WILL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; BROTHER CAN shock you. Brother says
[55:08] &gt;&gt; this divinely revealed mystery truth.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; He says the divinely revealed mystery
[55:16] truth
[55:17] &gt;&gt; will literally
[55:19] &gt;&gt; will literally
[55:21] &gt;&gt; turn the hands of the children back to
[55:24] THE PENTECOSTAL FATHERS.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; WHO ARE THE PENTECOSTAL FATHERS?
[55:27] &gt;&gt; It was the Peters.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; What was happening in Pentecost?
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Peter's shadow WAS HEALING THE SIEGE.
[55:35] Peter will come by the BEAUTIFUL
[55:42] but such as I have arise and go.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; They prayed and PETER WAS RELEASED FROM
[55:49] PRISON.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY can say amen? SIGNS AND WONDERS
[55:53] AND MIRACLES TOOK PLACE. Can someone say
[55:56] &gt;&gt; amen?
[55:58] &gt;&gt; But now, pastor me, how do we go back to
[56:00] Pentecost? Let's say we want to
[56:02] experience that. Can I be honest with
[56:05] you?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's good to pray. Yes, it's good
[56:08] to fast. But brother Brandham says this
[56:11] divinely revealed mystery truth will
[56:15] literally
[56:17] &gt;&gt; turn the hearts of the children back to
[56:19] the pentecable.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; As pastor Adrian is preaching the
[56:24] divinely revealed miss truth, you'll
[56:26] find yourself healed. You'll find
[56:29] yourself promoted. YOU'LL SEE FIRE
[56:31] COMING DOWN. YOU SEE miracles
[56:35] &gt;&gt; we don't how many can say amen
[56:38] &gt;&gt; steer people's emotions we don't
[56:41] propagate how many can say amen
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus did not stress the importance of
[56:47] works as he did the word
[56:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IF PEOPLE GOT the
[56:52] word
[56:55] WOULD FOLLOW that
[57:00] so when we preach the
[57:02] When WE PREACH THE WORD, IF IT IS THE
[57:04] REAL WORD,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; we speak like the Greeks to say WE WOULD
[57:09] SEE JESUS.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Says they were tired
[57:15] &gt;&gt; of lecturers.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; They wanted to see who is Jesus.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Even this is high time, brother Luke, we
[57:24] see Jesus.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; How many
[57:29] &gt;&gt; even right now? As I preach, I DON'T
[57:32] CARE WHAT IS YOUR SITUATION.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ALL THINGS ARE
[57:39] POSSIBLE?
[57:40] &gt;&gt; AS I just preach the word
[57:43] [applause and cheering]
[57:43] &gt;&gt; as we preach discerning the two spirits
[57:46] in the framework of the Christian
[57:48] church, you find yourself WITH THE HOLY
[57:50] GHOST. YOU FIND yourself healed. You
[57:53] find YOURSELF SET FREE. I'M SAYING RIGHT
[57:57] NOW. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TOMORROW.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; I'm talking ABOUT
[58:05] IT.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; GOD, A POWERLESS RELIGION. Someone say
[58:10] amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. Can someone SAY
[58:17] brother Tony?
[58:20] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT CATHOLIC BISHOP.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; COME ON. You know if we are not CAREFUL
[58:26] PASTOR IF WE ARE NOT CAREFUL
[58:29] &gt;&gt; WHEN A DEMON manifest we will call
[58:31] police.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; You [laughter] hear a pastor saying
[58:34] demons can we call the police brother?
[58:37] It's I'm telling you you are laughing
[58:39] &gt;&gt; but some people THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
[58:41] THESE THINGS.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; They say what is this now brother? Do
[58:45] you have a number for the police?
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Because we DON'T HAVE THE POWER.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; WE ARE JUST TALKING. HOW MANY CAN SAY
[58:51] AMEN? But if you continue listening to
[58:54] the word, listening to the word, ONE OF
[58:57] THESE DAYS,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; ONE OF THESE DAYS,
[59:03] &gt;&gt; but do you see how it happens?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; You don't propagate it.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; You don't steal people's emotions. You
[59:09] just preach the word.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; You just preach the word.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; And if it IS THE TRUE WORD, HOW MANY CAN
[59:16] SAY
[59:17] &gt;&gt; MIRACLES WILL HAPPEN. Even right now,
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT TELL ME THAT PASTOR, I'M
[59:25] ALREADY BLESSED.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; I'M ALREADY set free.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; John,
[59:33] &gt;&gt; can someone say amen?
[59:35] &gt;&gt; John Charlott just became a millionaire
[59:39] &gt;&gt; by the word.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God will defeat Satan
[59:45] anytime, any place, under any
[59:47] circumstance. [laughter] Even here in
[59:49] Phoenix, even today
[59:52] &gt;&gt; the devil can go.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[59:56] &gt;&gt; So that what was I saying, Pastor M?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; When sometimes
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; we need to teach people,
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; people need to be grounded,
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; people need to be solid.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because brotherham says
[1:00:11] an evangelist they water the seeds that
[1:00:15] the teachers has already planted.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; So the teacher and the evangelist they
[1:00:21] work hand in hand. So if pastor does not
[1:00:25] plant the seeds
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; even if an evangelist comes how many can
[1:00:29] say amen. The seed won't germinate
[1:00:32] because it's not planted.
[1:00:34] says preaching, it's watering the seeds
[1:00:38] that has been planted.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; So don't underestimate
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; when you see pastor me planting the
[1:00:45] seeds, planting the seeds. How many can
[1:00:47] say amen?
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; The rain will come
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; to quicken what has been planted.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; So we are both working together.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; So can I just see how I wind up? How
[1:00:59] many we blessed?
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; How many [applause] blessed? blessed.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; How many are going to hold on to the
[1:01:07] word
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; because the real word
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; has got power? The real word has got
[1:01:14] healing. The real word has got miracles.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; DON'T UNDERESTIMATE.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY can say amen?
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; When your pastor is preaching, just
[1:01:25] teaching, I'm being honest.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; You will find yourself set free.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:01:33] When God allows me to run around and
[1:01:35] evangelize, I will do it.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; But we should not be people who are
[1:01:42] one-sided.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; The power what what you understand.
[1:01:47] There's also others as well that also
[1:01:49] want the the teaching alone without also
[1:01:52] the miracle good.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Can I also give you the quotation for
[1:01:56] that? Brother says some people have got
[1:01:59] the word only without the spirit. Some
[1:02:03] people have got the spirit only without
[1:02:06] the word. So we must mix the B
[1:02:14] and [cheering and applause] the spirit.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY CAN say amen?
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; The mechanics and the dynamics.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[1:02:24] So if we just continue on the word only.
[1:02:27] Oh, I see that church. I'm not talking
[1:02:28] about you. You see that right? You see
[1:02:30] what what and people are seeking. People
[1:02:33] want brother. We want. How many say
[1:02:36] amen?
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; So God to come down
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; to manifest his power.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. Sometimes I feel like
[1:02:47] evangelists must go and preach and
[1:02:49] teachers churches and teachers must go
[1:02:52] and teach evangelist. How many are
[1:02:54] saying?
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; I'm being honest.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; We need one another.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed?
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Do you love him, brother?
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; How many say amen?
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Listen now, pastor. He says here, how
[1:03:11] many were blessed?
[1:03:12] He says here,
[1:03:14] I'll preach. He says, and we see how he
[1:03:18] heads up.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; See, pastor Ed, he says, and you get
[1:03:24] that on the telephone. You see, he says
[1:03:27] now, if the Lord permits us to do it.
[1:03:31] So, brother Brana wanted to preach
[1:03:34] betrayal of the serpent.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; He wanted to look for a hole to preach
[1:03:39] that. Listen. And then he says, "If the
[1:03:42] Lord permits us to do it." And now just
[1:03:46] watch how cunning that fellow is.
[1:03:49] Listen, I'm telling you, brother Brham
[1:03:51] is bringing some of the contents
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; of the trail of the sand of what he
[1:03:58] wanted to preach. If he was get if he
[1:04:01] was if he got the opportunity, no, let
[1:04:04] watch. He says, he says, "And you you
[1:04:08] all get okay." He says, "And now you
[1:04:11] just [clears throat] watch how cunning
[1:04:13] that fellow is.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; How he is just exactly well. They hey
[1:04:22] they are just like Judas
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; and Jesus there. both brothers in their
[1:04:30] tribe
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; like Esau and Jacob,
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; the crow and the dove
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; sitting on the same roost
[1:04:41] and everything is a twin
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; in this great warfare that we are in.
[1:04:49] Brother, when I saw this,
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Do you hear what I'm saying? So I see an
[1:04:57] idea. I'm I'm not preaching the trail of
[1:05:00] the seven.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching the two spirits that are
[1:05:05] working within the framework
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; of the Christian church. So brother and
[1:05:11] pastor listen be honest. Me I want
[1:05:13] people who are honest.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Don't say pastor Moses is making up
[1:05:16] things. This is it. How many can
[1:05:18] [laughter] say amen?
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Huh? He says here how cunning the fellow
[1:05:23] is. Number one, he is coming. Are we
[1:05:26] together? Number two, he says Judas and
[1:05:29] Jesus there. So in other words, where
[1:05:32] Jesus is,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Judas will also be there.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Where Isa is, Jacob will also be there.
[1:05:39] And brother Brham comes as well and says
[1:05:42] a revival produces twins. So in other
[1:05:46] words, do you see friends as I close how
[1:05:48] the devil operates?
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? He comes
[1:05:54] within
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; even in the garden of Eden you will see
[1:05:58] that there was the tree of of life
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; and besides that there was the tree of
[1:06:05] the good and evil
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; of the knowledge of the good and evil so
[1:06:09] they are always twins
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; when Jesus comes on the scene Judas also
[1:06:14] comes on the scene
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; when Jesus left the scene and he was
[1:06:18] hanging on the cross we see Judas as
[1:06:21] well he's hanging on
[1:06:23] on a tree as well. So brother, if you
[1:06:26] are honest, you will see these clues.
[1:06:29] How many can say amen?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; But it's a twin war.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; These are twins. So the battle he says
[1:06:36] here, pastor, he says, and everything is
[1:06:40] a twin in this great what? Warfare that
[1:06:45] we are in. So you must KNOW HOW TO
[1:06:48] FIGHT.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; So the battle is inside.
[1:06:52] How many can say amen?
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Hey, when there is Moses, there is
[1:06:57] Ramses.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Where there is Moses, can I read this
[1:07:02] quickly?
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Can I read this? Numbers chapter 16.
[1:07:08] Pastor me, God bless you.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Numbers chapter 16.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Pastor Johnny, are you there, my friend?
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; How many? Yeah. Listen. Numbers chapter
[1:07:19] 16 verse one. Now, Kora, the son of
[1:07:22] Each,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; the son of Kath, the son of Levi, and
[1:07:27] Datan, and Abam, the sons of Elab, and
[1:07:31] on the son of Pale, sons of Reuben,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; took men.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; How many can say you hear here that says
[1:07:40] sons of what? Levi.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; So, you see that this was a family
[1:07:45] affair.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; A brother is born for adversity. So you
[1:07:50] see that these people that were fighting
[1:07:52] Moses, it was men of renown,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; famous in the congregation,
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; and can we read again in in what?
[1:08:03] Revelation 12, you are going to see
[1:08:06] something. Revelation 12. Pastor Adrian,
[1:08:09] God bless you.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Revelation 12
[1:08:13] verse 7. The Bible says, "And there was
[1:08:17] war in heaven. Michael and his angels
[1:08:21] fought against the dragon and the dragon
[1:08:24] fought he with his angels
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; and [singing] prevailed not so I can't
[1:08:28] continue but watch in this warfare
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; there is this that I want to close with
[1:08:34] the principle of the rightand man
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; can someone say the principle of the
[1:08:41] rightand man
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; the devil how many can say amen he will
[1:08:46] use something that is close to you.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why sometimes you see that
[1:08:53] you hear a pastor's daughter was
[1:08:54] impregnated, a pastor's son did this.
[1:08:57] Can I tell you today it's not the
[1:08:59] problem of the pastor.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to attack the what? The
[1:09:05] pastor and he he fails and he will use
[1:09:09] something close. He knows that if the
[1:09:12] pastor is drugs, it will affect the
[1:09:16] devil uses the principle [clears throat]
[1:09:19] of the right hand.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; And please listen to this. I'm serious.
[1:09:24] Now, if you are serious, let's pray
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; for all [singing] the right hand men of
[1:09:32] our pastor.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; I mean it. Amen.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; People who are close to our pastors,
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; let's pray for them.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Luke, do you know why? Because
[1:09:45] the devil uses people who are close. He
[1:09:50] can Oh, brother. Do you hear what I'm
[1:09:52] saying? Many people they say Peter was
[1:09:55] so weak. Peter could do this. You know,
[1:09:58] sometimes you ask as you think maybe
[1:10:00] foolish questions. Sometimes he's found
[1:10:02] only what in a river in without clothes
[1:10:05] and what and people say hey Peter needs
[1:10:08] grace.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Some people think that James and John
[1:10:11] they were so powerful more than Peter.
[1:10:13] That's a lie.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; It's only that John and James they were
[1:10:17] not where Peter was.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Do you hear? If they were where Peter
[1:10:22] was, do you know that Peter was the
[1:10:24] right hand man? He was given the keys.
[1:10:27] So the devil will come using something
[1:10:30] which is close. That's why Jesus when
[1:10:33] Peter came now and said no no no he cut
[1:10:36] someone's ear. He says you can't go
[1:10:39] there. You can't die. Do you know he was
[1:10:41] against the will of God? It was the
[1:10:44] devil that was using him. And Jesus said
[1:10:47] get thee behind Satan.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you? He says we want to trail
[1:10:53] him. How many? So when you hear about
[1:10:57] the trail of the serpent,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; we are not talking about seven seat.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Hear me?
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; What is a trail? A trail is a path.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; A trail, how many can say amen? Is a
[1:11:12] road. So when we talk about the trail of
[1:11:15] the serpent, we are not preaching
[1:11:18] serpent seed. We know what is happen but
[1:11:22] we are saying WE WANT TO KNOW the road
[1:11:26] which the serpent
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; uses
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; when you know that
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; can I say this can I say this a person
[1:11:35] how many can say can how many are being
[1:11:38] blessed
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; listen [clears throat] we want to we are
[1:11:41] not in ignorant of his devices we are
[1:11:44] saying we are saying the trail of the
[1:11:46] what of the serpent he says We want to
[1:11:49] train. We want to see his Can I say Can
[1:11:52] I say this? People who work in zoos or
[1:11:55] in the national parks there,
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; they are now experienced those guides.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; When they see the trail,
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; the marks of the animals, they know this
[1:12:06] is a lion.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; This is a
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; this is a leopard. Do you know why? If
[1:12:12] you don't know the trail,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; the foot marks of a leopard,
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; you will go where it is
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; and you will die.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; But if you know that these are the
[1:12:24] trails of a leopard, you change
[1:12:26] direction. SO THIS WHAT I'M PREACHING,
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO see the trail of the enemy
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; so that YOU DON'T NEED HIM. SO THAT YOU
[1:12:36] CHANGE DIRECTION. How many can say amen?
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; You can go [applause] exactly
[1:12:44] WHERE THE LION IS,
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE DEVIL IS.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen?
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; So we are saying you must know that what
[1:12:52] my brother.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; So when I was seeing as I close I saw
[1:13:00] pastor Adrian that oh the devil uses
[1:13:04] this principle
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; of the right man in heaven. How many can
[1:13:09] say amen? Satan was almost equal with
[1:13:11] God except creation. Do you know that?
[1:13:15] And he is the one who was listen again
[1:13:19] when we go down here. The devil used the
[1:13:23] serpent which was so close
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; to mankind.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Look at brother Brana when he made one
[1:13:32] of his most fatile mistakes here in
[1:13:35] South Africa. It was his right hand man
[1:13:39] and those ministers they said no no no
[1:13:42] no you must go to CL stop. You must go
[1:13:45] there. Brother says no. The angel said I
[1:13:49] must go to Junior Sydney Jackson's farm
[1:13:52] for 10 days and go to job then after
[1:13:54] that I must go to Deb.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; But the man of God I'm talking about
[1:14:00] that trail not that they wanted it but
[1:14:02] they did not know that they were listen
[1:14:05] Mr. Schum and those ministers they were
[1:14:08] just in the trail.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; How many say?
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; How many are saying?
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Look at Judas. He was just in the trail.
[1:14:15] He was the right man. So all the arrows
[1:14:18] just came to him.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; That's why you see even we pastors we
[1:14:22] are always in trouble because smite the
[1:14:25] shepherd and the sheep will scatter. So
[1:14:27] all the dads they come to us because we
[1:14:30] are the right hand men of God.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Who organized the coup? How many can say
[1:14:37] amen? Ah was the counselor of what? Of
[1:14:41] David
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; and he teamed up with Jonathan. But I'm
[1:14:46] TALKING ABOUT THE TRAIL. HOW MANY can
[1:14:48] say amen?
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; So that's why I'm saying pray
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; for the ministers
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; in your assembly. Pray for the associate
[1:14:56] pastors.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Do you hear what I'm saying?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not it's not that they are
[1:15:02] evil, but they are right in the trail.
[1:15:05] How many can say amen?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; He uses the principle of the right hand
[1:15:09] man.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Even when we cast
[1:15:13] out a demon right now, I have cast out
[1:15:16] some demons. You will see a demon
[1:15:18] speaking. It's me. I'm the auntie. She
[1:15:20] won't survive. She won't progress. Is
[1:15:24] someone close
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; is the one that wants to finish you.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Look at Look at
[1:15:33] how many can say amen.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Look at the people even right now. How
[1:15:38] many who are destroying this message?
[1:15:42] Men of
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; can I shock you the people who are doing
[1:15:46] more to this message. I'm sorry to say
[1:15:49] this. It is not young ministers like us
[1:15:51] like this but no it is men of renown.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? In the
[1:15:57] congregation people who study funny
[1:16:00] things. How many can say amen? It's men
[1:16:02] of renown listed upon our feet. How many
[1:16:06] can say amen? How many?
[1:16:09] [applause]
[1:16:11] [cheering]
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Look at Job.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; His wife said kiss God.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; She was close says you speak like one of
[1:16:23] the foolish woman.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; He never said you are foolish. You speak
[1:16:27] like
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; how many can say amen. Moses who was
[1:16:30] fighting him. Hey pastor Le. May God
[1:16:33] help us.
[1:16:34] And I thank God that it moved so well.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Was anyone offended?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Was was anyone offended?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Let's pray for our
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; pray also for your wife.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; The devil can also use your wife
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; to take you out of God's will. Look at
[1:16:53] William Brham when he was called to
[1:16:55] organize that for him to preach in
[1:16:57] Mishawak and then his mother-in-law came
[1:17:01] and said don't take my daughter to
[1:17:02] thrash like that
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; someone was so close and brother Brham
[1:17:07] lost his wife
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; lost his daughter because of that many
[1:17:12] times we get in trouble because of
[1:17:14] people who are so
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; so but what am I saying this warfare the
[1:17:20] devil uses infiltration
[1:17:23] He comes inside. So the people who want
[1:17:26] to destroy this message, they are in the
[1:17:28] message.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; People who are preaching polygamy
[1:17:32] in the message. Funny doctrines.
[1:17:35] People who say the rapture has already
[1:17:37] happened.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; People who are saying we are now in the
[1:17:40] millennium
[1:17:42] defend the two spirit which are working
[1:17:45] in the framework of the Christian
[1:17:47] church. Come pastor Adrian the original.

[1:19:03] is what [music] I believe
[1:19:10] [music]
[1:19:12] is
[1:19:17] my [music] original.

[1:19:22] [applause]
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to know the spirit, the
[1:19:28] angel of the Lord is right here in this
[1:19:30] place.

[1:19:33] you'll know his presence is right here.

[1:19:41] speaking to needs.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Those of you who know what I'm talking
[1:19:44] about, you know that he's not the
[1:19:46] discerner of a man. Yes, Lord.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; That's a discerner of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; right now. Don't follow
[1:19:52] [singing and music] the trail of the
[1:19:52] serpent,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; but follow the bloody footprints of the
[1:19:55] cross.

[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Lord, we once again realize what a

[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; the mortal man can speak to God.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; And he would take the time to listen.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; To hear and answer our prayer.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; And our father this [music] evening,
[1:29:54] Lord, even as we come unto thee, Lord
[1:29:56] God, we realize, Lord God, that you your
[1:29:59] word is not of any private
[1:30:01] interpretation,
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; but you alone interpret your own word.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And ab father, we believe that we've
[1:30:07] heard you this evening.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. speaking to us,
[1:30:11] Lord God, and interpreting your word,
[1:30:13] Lord God. And ab father, we know, Lord
[1:30:16] God, that your word has fallen on good
[1:30:18] ground, Lord God, that it will take root
[1:30:20] and bear fruit, Lord God. Father, what a
[1:30:23] Lord, an encouragement, Lord God, Lord,
[1:30:26] to know that you are mindful of us, Lord
[1:30:28] God. And our father, in this world, that
[1:30:30] we would have trouble, Lord God, even as
[1:30:32] we sit in our closest friend, a brother
[1:30:35] would deceive us.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; But we thank you, Lord, that you said
[1:30:38] that you'd [singing] stick to it close.
[1:30:42] We promise, Lord God, that you'd not
[1:30:43] only be with us, but you'd be in us,
[1:30:46] Lord God, even until the end of the
[1:30:47] world, Lord, that you would go before
[1:30:49] us, Lord God. And if you are for us, who
[1:30:52] can be against us, Lord, Lord, and
[1:30:54] therefore, as your bride this evening,
[1:30:56] Lord, we know that your bride cannot be
[1:30:59] deceived.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; And our father, we are a type of people,
[1:31:02] Lord. We are a people that cannot be
[1:31:04] deceived. And our father what a comfort
[1:31:06] that it is Lord God and Lord God we
[1:31:09] haven't come this evening Lord God with
[1:31:11] vain repetition of words Lord God we
[1:31:13] know Lord God that that many Lord God
[1:31:15] with their lips they profess so many
[1:31:17] things but their heart tells something
[1:31:19] else Lord God. Therefore, we want to
[1:31:21] make sure that our approach is right,
[1:31:23] Lord God. That our attitude is right,
[1:31:25] Lord God. For that alone, Lord God, will
[1:31:28] bring every promise of yours into
[1:31:30] manifestation, Lord God, because you are
[1:31:32] the word, Lord God, and our father,
[1:31:35] every need here this evening, Lord God.
[1:31:37] Oh Lord God, your children, Lord God,
[1:31:39] you are mindful, Lord God,
[1:31:40] [music and singing] you know exactly
[1:31:41] what it is, Lord God. And you are more
[1:31:44] than able Lord God. There is nothing
[1:31:46] Lord God that is too big for the small
[1:31:49] part of the impossible Lord God. Oh ab
[1:31:51] father your prophet said you would
[1:31:53] bankrupt heaven Lord God to [applause]
[1:31:55] grant your children the desires of their
[1:31:57] heart Lord God. And our father this
[1:31:59] evening Lord God I know and we believe
[1:32:01] that your children will go to seeing
[1:32:03] Lord God. But we've got the dynamics and
[1:32:05] the mechanics Lord God. We got the word
[1:32:07] Lord God in spirit and in truth God. Aba
[1:32:10] Father, we have all of thee, Lord God.
[1:32:13] And our father, we pray, Lord God, that
[1:32:15] Lord, you will be our portion and be our
[1:32:17] guide. May your blessings go over each
[1:32:19] one that's gathered here, Lord God, this
[1:32:21] evening, Lord God. Your ministers, Lord,
[1:32:23] your servant that you've used, Lord God,
[1:32:25] that you continue to be his portion and
[1:32:27] his guide, Lord God, over his family and
[1:32:29] his loved ones at home, Lord God, that
[1:32:31] in all things, Lord God, we want to give
[1:32:33] you the praise, the glory, and the
[1:32:35] honor. May you be exalted. May we be
[1:32:37] humbled, Lord God. and we we find grace,
[1:32:40] Lord God, to meet you, Lord God, in the
[1:32:42] clouds of glory, Lord God. Oh, what a
[1:32:44] promise, Lord God, of the time that
[1:32:45] we're living in and we see the signs
[1:32:47] around us, Lord God. It's homegoing
[1:32:49] time, Lord God. [applause and cheering]
[1:32:50] And we pray, Lord God, that we, Lord
[1:32:52] God, would be ready, Lord God. We don't
[1:32:54] want to be, Lord, just a virgin, Lord
[1:32:55] God. We just don't want to be in this
[1:32:57] message, Lord God. Oh, and they're going
[1:32:59] out, Lord, looking for something, Lord.
[1:33:01] But in that time, the bridegroom came,
[1:33:03] Lord God, and they want to be left
[1:33:05] behind, Lord God. For our greatest
[1:33:07] desire, Lord, is to make heaven our
[1:33:09] home, Lord God. And as your prophet
[1:33:11] said, it is only by the grace of God.
[1:33:13] And we pray now this evening, Lord God,
[1:33:15] even as we close, may that grace of God,
[1:33:17] Lord God, that surpasses all human
[1:33:20] understanding, Lord God, may it be now
[1:33:22] showed upon your children that they have
[1:33:24] no room to contain what you have for
[1:33:27] them, Lord God. Grant this we pray thee,
[1:33:29] for we ask this in Jesus name. Christ.
[1:33:32] Amen.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. Hallelujah.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. God bless you.
[1:33:40] Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, dear pastor.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; You're tremendously blessed.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Brother Brandon tells us
[1:33:49] when somebody's got the ball,
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; you don't try and take the ball away
[1:33:53] from him.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; But you see how you can assist him
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; so that he can score the goals. and you
[1:34:00] supported the pastor very well
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; and he scored many goals tonight.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know it's not over.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow you'll be running with the ball
[1:34:09] again
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; and you got to support him.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So tomorrow he'll be with Pastor
[1:34:15] Mvin in Ashville. Amen. At 7:00 p.m.
[1:34:19] Everybody's welcome to support that
[1:34:20] meeting. And then Friday is also
[1:34:23] playing.
[1:34:25] He's got the ball again on Friday.
[1:34:27] Pastor Eshko. Amen. Palm view drive
[1:34:30] there. Amen. So all of you are welcome
[1:34:34] to let the brothers score more goals for
[1:34:36] Jesus.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this could just be the start
[1:34:40] of something. You know of somebody that
[1:34:41] needs to be in service. Invite your
[1:34:43] friend. Invite your family member. Tell
[1:34:46] them, you know what, you're going
[1:34:47] through this problem. Why don't you come
[1:34:48] with me to church?
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord can deliver you
[1:34:51] from the situation.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; We've got to have confidence in what we
[1:34:54] believe.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we knew of a good doctor and we
[1:34:58] knew somebody was sick, that doctor
[1:35:00] could treat them. We will say, "No, you
[1:35:01] must go to this doctor."
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; He's the best.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; We're telling you to bring them to Dr.
[1:35:07] Jesus.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; He's going to be speaking through Pastor
[1:35:09] Moses.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he is the best.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the Lord bless you and keep
[1:35:13] you even as we dismiss. We'll sing a
[1:35:16] song as we dismiss. Amen. We have a
[1:35:17] little snack box out there that you can
[1:35:19] take on your way home. Amen.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; And be blessed. Amen. God bless you.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's sing. I am
[1:35:26] blessed. I am blessed every day that I
[1:35:29] live. I am blessed [music]
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; when I wake up in the morning till I lay
[1:35:33] my head to rest. I am blessed.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; I am blessed. [music]
[1:35:45] I am [singing] blessed.
[1:35:48] Every day that I [music and singing]
[1:35:51] live, I am blessed.
[1:35:56] When I wake up in the morning,
[1:35:59] [music and singing] till I lay my head
[1:36:02] to rest, I am blessed.
[1:36:06] [music and singing]
[1:36:07] I am blessed. Let's sing it again. I am
[1:36:10] blessed. I am blessed. The Lord bless
[1:36:13] you.

[1:36:18] Every day that I
[1:36:22] am [music and singing]
[1:36:24] when I wake up,
[1:36:29] [music]
[1:36:30] [singing] I am
[1:36:33] I am
[1:36:36] [singing and music]
[1:36:37] I am
