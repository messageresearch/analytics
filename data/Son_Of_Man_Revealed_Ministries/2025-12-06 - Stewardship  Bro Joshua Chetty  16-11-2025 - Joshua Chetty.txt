Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And once again to come and draw from the spiritual stall this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. In a time where there's famine on the earth, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; word has been preserved for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; That we could have in abundance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And not only for us, &gt;&gt; it is now he said &gt;&gt; go into all the world &gt;&gt; and preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; The gospel, this word wasn't just for us. &gt;&gt; It is to also preserve life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the preservation of life, &gt;&gt; but through us &gt;&gt; to sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. that stood the test of time that come and receive the word &gt;&gt; by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; For them that are in Christ, &gt;&gt; the word has been preserved. &gt;&gt; And we have the word stored up so that now we can give out &gt;&gt; this word that has been preserved. Amen. While they eating from garbage cans, while they are in where they IN SPIRITUAL DEBT, YOU HAVE THE WORD of life. &gt;&gt; You have life within you. Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE LIFE. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So we pray this morning that the the Lord will stir something within us. Uh I'm trying not to do a a preaching this morning. I just my introduction. I'm just want to do a little presentation that will maybe encourage you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To it will stir up the faithful in you to do something more for God. Amen. That's what we want to do. We just want to be faithful and want to do something for God. &gt;&gt; Something for the kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz I believe we should be kingdom minded. We always want to do something for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Yes. But God placed us for his purpose. &gt;&gt; And therefore when when we received his word, we said now we we sold all our treasures of this life. We found the pole of great price and we said Lord I want to be a prisoner to you and become a prisoner of Christ. In other words, it's no longer I that will it my father that you that will it in your will be done in me. No longer that's what my will but your will be done in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we pray this morning we open our Bibles to the book of Luke. Chapter 16 reading from verse 1 to13. Pray that God will give us something this morning that will keep us inspired to be pressing on in his kingdom. Amen. And do something for his kingdom. Luke 16 1-13. And he says, "And he said unto his disciples, there was a certain rich man which had a steward, and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship." &gt;&gt; Amen. for thou mayest be no longer steward. Then the steward said within himself, what shall I do? For my lord take away from me the stewardship. I cannot dig to beg. I am ashamed. &gt;&gt; I am resolved what to do that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their house. So he called every one of his lords debtors unto him and said unto the first, how much owest thou unto my lord? And he said and 100 measures of oil and he said unto him, take thy bull and sit down quickly and write 50. So now he wants to be deceitful now. And then said he to another, and how much? And he said, how much was thou? And he said, and 100 measures of wheat. And he said unto him, "Take thy bill and write four score." And the four score and the Lord commanded I &gt;&gt; Well, eight. Okay. Sorry. Four score. &gt;&gt; Yes. And the Lord commanded that the unjust steward because he had done wisely. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of lights. And I say unto you, make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness. That when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much. And he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to you? Who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters. For either he will ate the one and love the other, or else he will alter the one and despise the other, he cannot serve God and memon. Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I just want to speak this morning on a little little title. Give an account of thy stewardship. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm taking it from the book of Luke. Amen. Give an account of thy stewardship. And that's a question to every believer &gt;&gt; to give an account of thy stewardship. Now, God made us stewards. We know that our life, the very life we have is God's. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The gift that you have is God's. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The family that God has blessed you with is God's. &gt;&gt; Amen. The time that you have allotted to you on this earth is God's. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The influence that you have over man is God's. &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD. &gt;&gt; THIS VERY MESSAGE THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED IS GOD'S. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And every opportunity that you have on this earth belongs to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But we speaking on stewardship this morning. &gt;&gt; What does it mean? It means management of something that belongs to someone else. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now everything that we have, it belongs to God. But we are here to MANAGE IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK to the beginning. When God put man on the earth, he made him the God of the earth to manage the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He made him have dominion to manage the earth. &gt;&gt; So God is is still God of the everything. He's the creator. Amen. All things belongs to him. But we are there to manage what he has entrusted us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He has entrusted us to certain things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So God is the owner and we are his stewards. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what does stewardship means? IT MEANS THERE MUST BE responsibility &gt;&gt; and there must be accountability. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of people these days don't like to be accountable. Therefore, you find a lot of people not serving God or they claim to serve God but don't want to be found under a fellowship. &gt;&gt; The reason why they don't want to be found under a fellowship and they claim to serve God. They claim to be believe the message of the hour is because they don't want to be accountable. &gt;&gt; Help us Lord. And the reason why why they don't want to be accountable, they are not responsible &gt;&gt; for the things that God entrusted them with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For them to claim to have believed the message of the hour because not this message is not meant for everyone to see. &gt;&gt; So they claim to to receive this message but they don't want to take on the responsibility &gt;&gt; because receiving this message the message come with what it was a shout that went forth. Amen. A mighty angel come down. But then also the scripture said you must take the book, eat the book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he didn't stop there. He said THAT THOU MUST PROPHESY AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So there IS A RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE WHEN YOU have received the Holy Ghost, what it mean? The spirit of Christ is now in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then IF THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN YOU, then that means there MUST BE A REFLECTION OF CHRIST FROM WITHIN YOU. FROM WITHIN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And our people DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND SHOW THAT REFLECTION OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; So what they do? They hide in them. &gt;&gt; Help us &gt;&gt; instead of coming to fellowship. Because when you come into fellowship, you are now finding your place in the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THE ONLY WAY GOD CAN FUNCTION IS THROUGH THE BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; God chose no other WAY BUT FUNCTIONING THROUGH HIS BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And if you're not in fellowship, THEN YOU'RE NOT FINDING YOUR PART IN the body to be placed in the body. &gt;&gt; Now there's no now each fellowship is sovereign, but each one has a part to play in the body. There might BE A DIFFERENT PART OF THE BODY, BUT THEY ARE PLACED POSITIONALLY PLACED IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And this body IS A FULLY FUNCTIONAL BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So stewardship means responsibility and accountability. SO A STEWARD MUST PROTECT IT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; And you must use it correctly. &gt;&gt; What has been until much is given much is required. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Much word is given to you in this hour. &gt;&gt; You are GIVEN IN A FOOD IN ABUNDANCE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; But you must use it correctly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must ALSO PROTECT IT. HOW DO YOU PROTECT THIS WORD? by the very life that you live. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The people are looking at your life. &gt;&gt; Your life presents the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can't be higher than you preach. You can't live higher than you preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you are claiming to believe this message and to have received this message, then people are watching your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO YOU GOT TO WATCH. YOU GOT TO PROTECT THIS WORD. YOU GOT TO PROTECT THE MESSAGE TO NOT BRING uh disrepute to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO YOU GOT TO PROTECT THE WORD &gt;&gt; BY GUARDING YOUR LIFE &gt;&gt; BY THE CHOICES YOU MAKE IN LIFE BY THE THINGS YOU HAVE THAT PEOPLE YOU hang around with. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; BY THE INFLUENCES YOU HAVE. &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT IS GIVEN TO YOU, you must now increase it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In other words, this very word that's given to you, you go now. And how you do you increase this word now? You absorb this word. &gt;&gt; YES. YOU GO AND STUDY THE word to show itself approved. &gt;&gt; We living in a time where people just want food just thrown to them. They don't want to digest it and let it let it take effect in their lives. You know what's gobble and go. &gt;&gt; People want to gobble and go and have takeouts. &gt;&gt; Those foods are processed foods. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But proper food that takes time to digest. And you haven't you know why you're having proper food? Because your intention is that when I eat this food, it's going to make a difference to my body. &gt;&gt; It's going to benefit me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So just like when you eat spiritual food, you don't just go and go anything. You go and study it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know the Bible said the Brian, they study the scriptures. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You go back from what he's preached to you. Now remember the the preacher cannot just speak everything to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's giving you nuggets. He's giving you the word. But you absorb from there and then you take you go. Now he's making reference to scriptures. He's making a reference to quotation. YOU GO BACK, &gt;&gt; YOU STUDY IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU GROW FROM THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You increase with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not deprived of anything this hour. You've got all the word revealed to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you increase with IT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU GOT TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT FOR IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother was just sharing with me the other day and he was just so excited and he was telling me you know uh how he had to come in the message just because of fellowship. &gt;&gt; Just by fellowship the word was brought out and he come in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; So just like that we got TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT FOR WHAT WE RECEIVED. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; When we fellowship with people do we present the gospel? &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we present the gospel when Mary is negative? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do we present the GOSPEL WHEN THE PEOPLE ARE TOXIC AROUND YOU? &gt;&gt; When when when the WORLD IS IN SUCH CHAOS AND MAN IS living in fear, do we present hope to them? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. DO WE SHOW THEM THERE'S A BETTER WAY OF LIFE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. There's a there's hope when man is in DESPAIR &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. When the world HAS NO SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS, THE GOSPEL HAS A SOLUTION TO EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVERY AREA OF YOUR LIFE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; All redemptive BLESSINGS BELONGS TO US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; And if God is working through THE BODY, THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY the world will have to have this gospel IS THROUGH YOU AND I. &gt;&gt; Because the headstone came crying grace shouting with shouting of grace. Grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So grace CAN ONLY BE GIVEN THROUGH the body presented through the body in this hour. So one day we got to give an account for all that is given to us. &gt;&gt; Stewardship is the wise and faithful handling of anything God places in your hands. &gt;&gt; So that this includes for example if if God placed you to be a musician then you got to be a good steward of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's the challenge he's given you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he's placed you to be a housewife that is what God placed you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. because you are blessed already because you you found a husband &gt;&gt; and you're married. God gave you given your husband. So you should be fit. You should be privileged. Some people are complaining they don't have an husband. &gt;&gt; So you should look at where God PLACED YOU. SOME PEOPLE ARE complaining they don't have children. &gt;&gt; So if God has given you children, you must know how TO BRING RAISE THEM UP IN THE WAYS OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU. &gt;&gt; And then God has given you time. &gt;&gt; Yes. HOW ARE YOU MANAGING YOUR TIME? &gt;&gt; Because for what what you put where you spend most of your time will show what the results are. For example, if you spend your time in garbage with all the filth and all the things on social media and all the so and all those things that will that will show when you look at your spiritual growth, it will show what you spend your time with. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SPEND YOUR TIME WITH THE THINGS OF GOD. with the people of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A lot of people are spending time with toxic people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; People who are just negative. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BAD INFLUENCE OVER THEM. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. NOW, &gt;&gt; now don't misconrue what I'm saying. Now, I'm not saying that you must not go to the unsaved. &gt;&gt; I am saying not to be influenced &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; by the people around you. &gt;&gt; Yes. But I if you are strong enough, you can go to the even a drunkard to even to a drug addict and be around him and you can influence them. &gt;&gt; But I'm saying don't be don't let them influence you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same with your families that are not saved and denomination. I'm not saying don't go to your families. You need to go to them, but present the gospel TO THEM &gt;&gt; OR SHOW THEM A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BECOME SALTY THAT THEY BECOME THIRSTY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T BE AROUND THEM AND THEY ARE INFLUENCING YOU. YES. &gt;&gt; Every time you leave from them, you take out something from them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT LET EVERY TIME YOU LEAVE THERE, THEY SAY THERE'S something different about them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They always consistent. &gt;&gt; There's something different about their lives. There's always a sweet nature about them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the things that they speak about in the Bible, I never heard these things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We don't hear these things in our churches. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, how do we handle? We must be faithful in handling what God has placed in our hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he's given us finances. If today is a million rand in your account, is that going to change &gt;&gt; your attitude? Is that going to make you a different person? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now, that is why you find that in life you go through stages. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God will bless you with little things. And if you manage the little things firstly in a little salary that you have your first job maybe it was a mega salary &gt;&gt; but you still was faithful in your tithing. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You still was faithful in coming to church &gt;&gt; trying to find put that petrol even when you was barely affording petrol. Yes. &gt;&gt; You put that petrol and you came to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then God blessed you with a better job. &gt;&gt; Yes. Then when the better job came now it's harder to pay a little more tithe &gt;&gt; or did you find yourself? No it's not hard it just part I've learned from the first stage of my life. &gt;&gt; God has taken me from there to a better stage. So now I can continue paying my tithes according to what I earn now and from there I I petrol is not an issue anymore. &gt;&gt; Now God has blessed me with a better car. &gt;&gt; I will make sure now and this better car can take me to other places. But I will make sure my church days are my church days. &gt;&gt; I've got more money to go on more holidays, but my time for the Lord is important. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how are you managing your finances? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if God if you are managing your finances in the right way, are you spending it in the wrong things? And now if God has blessed you with your money and you're going to go spend it gambling. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're going to go spend it on worldly things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Buying for example just say you supporting worldly events &gt;&gt; and you spending your finances there. So how God is going to bless you further now? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to give an account. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then God has given us opportunities. Maybe he's given you an opportunity to speak to somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you wouldn't open your mouth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because now you have fear of what they will say. &gt;&gt; You will fear of how they're going to take the word. &gt;&gt; Are you relying upon yourself? Did he not say in that hour he will give you the words? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You are dependent on yourself. You're supposed to be dependent upon the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT WORD TO SPEAK. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THEN PAUL SAY, "I BECOME ALL THINGS to all men &gt;&gt; in every situation." NO MATTER WHAT THEY TALKING ABOUT, YOU CAN PUT YOURSELF IN THAT SITUATION. IF IT'S SPORTS, TALK ABOUT SPORTS, BUT BRING GOD IN IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you you you need TO KNOW HOW TO bring God in every situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God has also given us spiritual gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we mismanaging it or are we using it for the benefit of the kingdom or we are not harnessing it? &gt;&gt; God has given us gifts but we're not living consecrated lives. &gt;&gt; We not be having a consistent prayer life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For now God to take us further. Amen. With those gifts &gt;&gt; or God has blessed us with a ministry. how we are not spending time to now progress in the ministry or we just want to remain stagnant. &gt;&gt; No, we we want to do things FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; We got to have the father's mindset. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have the mind of Christ. AND THE FATHER'S MINDSET is saying go into all the world and preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; God is not wishing to any anyone to perish, but he needs people to God. He said &gt;&gt; the harvest is plenty &gt;&gt; and the laborers are few. &gt;&gt; If somebody can show me a scripture in the Bible where it's taken out &gt;&gt; in this hour, &gt;&gt; he still says the harvest is plenty but the laborers are few. &gt;&gt; Yes. So God has placed all these things before us. Amen. So stewardship also means aligning everything in your life with God's will and purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in other words, your time, your finance, your your family life, everything you align with God's purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your career choices, your marriage choices, all the things that you're aligning is with God's purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we are God has given us entrusted us with his word. He's given us the blueprint of what he once done with his word. Amen. So he's given us this. He entrusted us. He entrust us with this thing here. So he wants us to take his word forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no one else coming to take this word forward except you that's to you that it's revealed to you in this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, after we leave this earth when our time is done here &gt;&gt; and God is done with the Gentiles, &gt;&gt; the gospel leaves the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. The the the God leaves the Gentiles &gt;&gt; and he goes to the Jews. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So the only opportunity for this gospel on the earth is through you and I. Yes. So it also means being faithful in both small and great things. All this is from uh the book of Luke. Amen. Luke 16:10 says, "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we know when we start being faithful in small things, &gt;&gt; then we are now getting ready for the next stage &gt;&gt; for greater responsibility. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll just read to you as the prophet brought it out in the quote. He speaks in the message. The queen of the south says, "Now there's a change in my ministry coming. And how many would there be one year that remembers when I first started on the field?" He said, "You remember it was given to me by the angel of the Lord that I would take my left hand and lay it onto the person who was st standing sick and not use my own voice and he would speak out and tell them what was wrong with them." You remember that? And you remember I told you that the Holy Spirit told me that night when I talked to him what it would be and said, "Then if you will be sincere, I'll come to a place that you'll know the very secret of their heart." See when the first gift was given to him he had to be sincere. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then how many of you that was in my first meetings heard me tell that before that ever come to pass raise up your hand. That's good. That has come to pass. Then he said if you continue to be sincere &gt;&gt; and humble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's giving you some secrets here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You want to progress in your spiritual work. Be sincere be humble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. are grow greater. Sorry, it'll it will grow greater and greater. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now this ministry is going to step higher now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Into another realm. So here's another secret in ministry. Now if you want it to go greater and greater is to continue to be sincere and humble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHERE IT WILL BE FAR BEYOND WHAT IT IS NOW. I don't know just what it is, but I'm one of the Holy Spirit to quickly now close my meetings off. My last one will be in Philadelphia and go into the hills and wait on the Lord to see which way to conduct this ministry. When I come out again, it'll be a new ministry. This ministry will never seize. This ministry will continue on. The first will continue on. It's still just the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, God gives gifts. He never takes gifts. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Your gift remains. But if you'll be honest with what you've got, God will take other talents and just keep pouring them on you. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Just keep pouring them on. &gt;&gt; If you just keep climbing on &gt;&gt; So, he's not going to take the gift the So, just like just like that, he's not going to take the initial scriptures in the Bible, Mark 16 and so forth, but he's going to be pouring on and on &gt;&gt; if you be faithful in it. Amen. There must be a progression, but he's not going to take all the other things away. &gt;&gt; He's always done it like in the Luda age, the Wesley age, or the Pentecost age, and on and on and on. There's no limit to it. God keeps on. So pray for me for needing needing badly needing your prayers. So you see what the prophet is saying here now. How there's a progression. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; By firstly being sincere and humble. So when you see that God is make making you climb up higher, he's taking you to higher heights, the progression, the secret is to stay sincere, to stay humble and be ready for the next move. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz God is always progression. God is always taking you to higher heights. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he wants us to be faithful in his little things first. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So stewardship means representing God in your decisions. Now we know that sometimes it's hard for people to be faithful in little things. You want to progress in life, people just want to land themselves in the best job, the high paying jobs. Now you find that in life uh responsibility comes with firstly you get a you go and take any job to get some experience &gt;&gt; and from there you that the experience is already adding on your CV. You be sincere in the job, you be faithful in the job. What happens the the next employer that's employing you saw that you worked in the job &gt;&gt; saw that you had a good recommendation in the job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he puts you into another job. &gt;&gt; Then you go higher and higher. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, I was just thinking about this in the morning. One of the lowest paying jobs that you can ever find in internships is a being a lawyer is the lowest paying jobs because the hardest thing to to do is to become a candidate attorney. That's because they are it's such a lowpaying job. But if somebody is faithful and sincere as a candidate attorney in that lowpaying job after they have completed becoming an attorney then there's progression from there and there's blessings from there. &gt;&gt; But a lot of people leave and give up. They're not willing to become a candid attorney. They don't want to take all the the things that they go through as a Canada attorney. They speak up, but they you get a lot of them posting on Facebook and so forth, posting how terrible their journey was because they don't they just want to go there and just they see all the fleshy attorneys and they think now we supposed to just land a good paying job. So that's one of the hardest job to become is becoming an attorney because it starts off with so low such a low salary &gt;&gt; and the expectations are high of you as a candidate attorney but people that are faithful in it and remain in it they progress from there but people give up along the way. So same that spiritually when we come a Christian everything is nice and rosy we excited to be with the Lord we excited with the things that God is giving us. Then the trials come. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But through this trial and suffering, God is mourning character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEN AS THE TRIALS COME, WE WANT TO GIVE UP ALONG the way. &gt;&gt; Yet we forget about the promises OF GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE NOT HAVING the the you're not seeing the bigger picture. Amen. That God has a bad expected end for you. &gt;&gt; He's promised you an expected end. &gt;&gt; And your end is promised. &gt;&gt; Yes. He's already showing you what your end result is. &gt;&gt; But along the journey, you must be tried and tested. &gt;&gt; Because why? HE'S BRINGING THE BEST OUT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE WHY? YOU COULDN'T DO IT ON YOUR OWN. GOD HAD TO SQUEEZE YOU AND BRING THE BEST out of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So stewardship means representing God in your decisions. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. What does that mean? I have a choice to marry an unbeliever. I'm going to make a decision to marry an unbeliever. Is that representing God in your decision? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I made a decision that I want to go now and gamble. &gt;&gt; Is that representing God in my decision? But if I if I say no, I want to find a partner that serves God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll give you an example of how people think. &gt;&gt; If if I say I I want to be a person that want to find a partner that serves God, &gt;&gt; that faithfully serves God, then I'm I'm representing God in my decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT IF I'M SAYING NO, I will just go and just marry any partner that don't serve God. Then what decision am I what am I representing &gt;&gt; in my decision? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Um I'm say I want to be a gambler. What how am I how am I representing God in that decision? &gt;&gt; All things that we have given in our life, we we need to represent God in the decision. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you'll know it because it must match with the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll know if it's representing God because God is one with his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If your decisions don't align with the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then you are not representing God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be it any decision, &gt;&gt; be it a career choice, be it a marriage choice, be it a financial choice, whatever things that you do in this life, if it doesn't align with the word, then you are not representing God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Everything that every decision that you take in this life must align with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus our example walked upon the earth, everything that he did, it had to please the father. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Thank you, father, that you have shown me this." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew that his decisions pleased the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our prophet on the earth when he walked everything that he did, he make a decision and he knew that he had to make a decision that would have pleased God. when he didn't do that when he was when the Holy Spirit told him to come to Durban, South Africa and he was prompted by ministers &gt;&gt; until eventually he had to give into them because he felt it made him they made him feel uncomfortable &gt;&gt; and he had TO PAY THE PRICE FOR IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But that decision didn't represent God. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD WAS DIRECTING HIM TO DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA. &gt;&gt; YES. YES. BECAUSE GOD HAD A PLAN AND PURPOSE FOR DURBAN, South Africa. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we learn from these things. Amen. The choices that we make, the decisions we take, it must represent God. &gt;&gt; Otherwise there will be consequences. In your workplace, what they call it consequence management. &gt;&gt; When someone do something wrong, they say there'll be consequence management. So just like that the choices that we make will have consequences. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And a GOOD STEWARD WILL ACT ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Every choice reflects who you serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So every believer is responsible for God what God reveals to them. So God gives small things first. If you are faithful, he will trust you with greater things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like that, we all know that when we came into the message, we didn't see everything. &gt;&gt; But then we as God started showing us more things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we are faithful in that. &gt;&gt; Then he started progressing us. &gt;&gt; Then more light was added. &gt;&gt; Then as you are still faithful in that, more light was added. &gt;&gt; And as you continue faithful in that, MORE LIGHT WILL BE ADDED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Just that when God gives you gifts, YOU HONESTLY THE GIFTS AND GOD will take you to higher heights with your gifts. &gt;&gt; And then if you are responsible with the GIFTS THAT HE'S GIVEN YOU, then he will take you to places you never thought you would go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God's gifts always find their places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Places that you thought you'd never be in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might just think this is a little small assembly, but there will be places here. There will be people here that will preach in other countries. There will be people here but God will use their talents in other places. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it all comes to would they be responsible what God has given them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So gifts must be handled carefully. God observes how you use what he gives you cuz we're going to be judged with what you did with that opportunities. Amen. But we have the greatest stewardship in all ages because we carry the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We carry the we are living in the hour where book of redemption has come down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore you can cry. You have the opportunity to give grace because redemption is in your hand. Not only in your hand you said take the book, eat the book. &gt;&gt; It's now within you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS WORD IS WITHIN YOU. YOU'VE DIGESTED IT and it's now brought you into the image. &gt;&gt; Now when the world looks at you, they look at the image. They look at Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So basically in simple terms, it's managing God's gifts God's way and giving God the results. All glory must go to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in everything that we do, God's name is glorified. When the gifts are managed correctly, when the what the challenge that God has given us are managed correctly, then who WILL BE GLORIFIED? GOD will be glorified. His name will be honored. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there was if you look at Luke 16 1 and 2, Jesus tells of the steward of misandalled the master's goods. He had to give an account. &gt;&gt; We know this is not just a story, a parable, but he's speaking about all the word that he's given us. He's speaking, it's a prophecy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every man, woman, minister, no matter who we are, whatever part we got to play in the body, we have to give an account &gt;&gt; individually. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The ministers will just preach the gospel. They have they have to give an account for what they preach for giving the word. But you have to give an account for what you received and what you're doing with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to give an account individually of what you have done with the word that was given to you. &gt;&gt; The word that was preached to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you find in our little testings, God is going to test our faithfulness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to test our attitude. &gt;&gt; The attitude towards his word. Amen. How we are receiving his word. Sometime his word may be impressed upon us. Sometime his word will be a sharp rebuke. But what's our attitude towards it? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes his word is coming to correct us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What is our attitude towards it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to test our consistency whether we are consistent. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know there's a story of a little boy how he had to go build something and uh he was a there was another old lady and they both had this thing where they said they have to build a certain thing but this boy thought I'm that's a old lady and I'm a small boy I got all the energy &gt;&gt; I can go and bully fast then what he did he began to become lazy &gt;&gt; he was a lazy boy &gt;&gt; and every day when he when his turn to go and get his billing done, what he'll do? He sleep. He said, "No, I got more time. I got more time." &gt;&gt; But this old lady, every day she go take one stone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; One stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every day. One stone at a time to build this building. &gt;&gt; And this boy said, "Don't worry, I still got time." &gt;&gt; And eventually it came when this lady built the building. And this boy got a shock because he just became so lazy and thought that he had time but time had finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So one of these days when you think you're still young, you still got time. &gt;&gt; Before you know it, YOU ARE AGED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU PASSED AGE, a certain age &gt;&gt; and you haven't done nothing for the Lord as yet. &gt;&gt; Oh, help us Lord. &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU START RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; DON'T WAIT FOR TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Don't try to do big things. TRY WITH THE SMALL THINGS. YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Start by reading. If you can't read the Bible, if you're such a lazy person, read one scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're such a lazy person to pray, start thanking the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Start with those little things. &gt;&gt; But be consistent in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just be consistent and you'll see every day from that 5 minute prayer to a 10-minute prayer. From one verse to the whole chapter. Amen. And it's going to progress from one chapter to one book. Amen. From a 10-minute prayer to a 1-hour prayer, you're going to progress slowly and gradually. And from a 1 hour prayer, you'll be praying consistently throughout the day in your praise, in your worship to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And before you know it, you'll be quoting scriptures in your prayer. &gt;&gt; But what you are reading, you're going to be start quoting it out now. &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying, be consistent. &gt;&gt; Don't try to say I got all the time and I'll just do big things for the Lord. Start with the little things. &gt;&gt; Be faithful in the little things. Show consistency in the little things and then you will progress to greater things. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is also going to test our obedience to his word. Obedience is better than sacrifice. &gt;&gt; People instead of being obedient following the word of God, they want to now rather sacrifice later. Lord, I'm so sorry. Lord, I should have followed your word. I should have listened to what the minister said. I should have listened and made the right choice, Lord. They don't want to be obedient. But obedience is better than sacrifice. &gt;&gt; God is going to test how we manage time. Amen. He's going to test all things. He's going to test how we handle money. We all want to be blessed with money. We all need finances. But God is going to test how we handle money. How we handle finances. Are we using it for the Is our intention to use it for the right reason? Is our intention kingdom minded? God is going to test our commitment to prayer. He's going to test our commitment to fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do not forsake the assembling of the saints &gt;&gt; as they see the day fast profile fast approaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the day is fast approaching and yet the people don't want to assemble with the saints. So little responsibilities maybe the pastor will give you a small task to do. It might be a small responsibility but be faithful in it. &gt;&gt; By that small responsibility God will God will show the pastor this person now been a good steward. This person has been faithful. This person can handle something greater now. So before God gives you more he watches how you handle less. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God tries us with little things first. Now Luke 16:11 speaks about he says if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to you the trust who will trust who will commit to you the trust the true riches. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon that means with the temporal things &gt;&gt; because what is mammon? The word memon come from an old Arabic term. It meaning wealth, riches or material possessions. But more than money, memon represents trust in earthly resources &gt;&gt; instead of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you you couldn't even now when earthly resources are given to you, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; you can't be trusted with those things. &gt;&gt; You given money, you can't you can't be trusted with it &gt;&gt; because that is temporal things. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you can't be trusted with it. But now you're asking God for greater things. &gt;&gt; So memory is not just money. Memory is a spirit behind money &gt;&gt; that wants to take the place of God. &gt;&gt; So that is why I'm saying if you want to be before you ask for God for abundant blessing and to increase your finances to give you more wealth, can you handle it if he gives it to you? &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can he handle it? Because would it change you? Would he change your attitude to the things of God? Would he take you away from the things of God? Oh, it'll make you exalt God more. Would it make you glorify God more and make you be a blessing in his kingdom? Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus speaks of unrighteous member not because money itself is evil but because the spirit attached to money, what he can do? He can corrupt a heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That is not anchored in the word. Amen. Someone does not anchor in the word, he can corrupt a man. He can take him away from the things of God. M will tell you depend on me. &gt;&gt; But what the word tells you, he is Jehovah Gyra or provider. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in other words, when you go to temporary riches, you want to depend. If you are dependent on your bank account, if you are dependent on your worldly wealth, you're dependent on your financial security or the secure job that you have and not dependent on God, God can take everything away. &gt;&gt; Cuz God is interested in YOUR SOUL. &gt;&gt; YOUR SOUL IS WORTH MORE THAN 10,000 WORDS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, me says security is what you have. God says security of who you belong to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we know that is temporal. Now God has already blessed us with all spiritual blessings. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we know that mammon competes for trust, loyalty, and faithfulness. &gt;&gt; Now God don't need to compete with that. He's already come to pay the price. &gt;&gt; He's already come to do the work. &gt;&gt; And he knows that all that belongs TO HIM WILL COME TO HIM. YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said you cannot serve God and mammon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can have money but you must never let money have you. &gt;&gt; Don't let it have a control over you. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; But the money must be used wisely. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It must be used over the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; A word being kingdom minded. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is true ritual? True rituals. We already have that. &gt;&gt; We have the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have the anointed words. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have discernment in this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We have given spiritual authority. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We are given influence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Over every demon spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Over every spirit on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We have this spiritual authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have the opportunity to influence the entire world &gt;&gt; to have an impact. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We understand the mysteries of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; We know that the life of Christ is in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is our true riches. Amen. Now God will never give these to unfaith to an unfaithful person. So God couldn't entrust this world with anybody. &gt;&gt; That is why this word couldn't come through from a denomination. &gt;&gt; This word God when he trust his word, it only come it only could come through virgin womb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's an unadulterated word. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not mixed with any creeds. It's not mixed with any dogmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a pure words. &gt;&gt; And that's why God had to select a prophet &gt;&gt; out out of the denominations. Amen. &gt;&gt; And take him out and give him his word. &gt;&gt; And that is why you and I when God gave us the word, HE HAD TO CALL US OUT FIRST. &gt;&gt; FIRST, he had to call us out. &gt;&gt; Yes. to give us this word because this word couldn't be fed from denomination. Amen. Now in 1612 said if you have not if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own. So if you're not faithful in your earthly things, how are you going to have if God is entrusting you given you a job for example, you're not faithful with that, how is going to make you progress to the next level? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we know in the Bible it speaks about Joseph. Now we know he passed the tests. David passed the test. Elijah passed the test. Abraham passed the tests. Moses passed the test. &gt;&gt; Amen. Looks Jesus said you cannot serve two masters. Your stewardship will reveal whom you serve. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Whether you serve God or mammon. &gt;&gt; Whether you serve God's will or your own will. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said you cannot serve both. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We turn our Bibles to Matthew 25. For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered them unto them his own goods. And unto one he gave five challenge, to another two, and to another one. To every man according to his several ability. So each one had a different ability, right? And straightway took his journey. Then he had he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents. And likewise he that had received the two he also gained other two. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth and his lords and hid his lord's money. After a long time the lord of the servants cometh and reckon it with them with them. And so he that receiveth five talents came and brought brought other five talents. He multiplied it. Amen. saying, "Lord, thou deliverest unto me five talents." Behold, I've gained beside them five talents more. His lord said unto him, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Thou has been faithful over a few things. I will make thee rule over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord." He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou delst unto me two talents. Behold, I've gained two other talents beside them. His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant. Thou has been faithful over a few things. I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord. Then he to receive the one talent. Came and said, Lord, you see the one talent. Lord, why those people must minister? Why those people must have a big church? Why those people must be a better skilled musician? But the one talent that you given, you haven't harnessed it. &gt;&gt; You haven't put it to use. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're complaining about someone else preaching. You're somebody else complaining about someone else progressing in ministry. But what have you done with what God has given you? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has given you. Maybe he made you to be a witness, but you wouldn't be a witness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He gave you a time to exalt, but you wouldn't exalt. &gt;&gt; Because why? You have been unfaithful in what he's given you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now you want to compare your complain about the other people that being blessed. Then who had received one chal said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art man reaping where thou has not sown and gathering where thou has not stroed. And I was afraid and went and hid thy challenge in the earth. Lo there thou as that is dying. His lord answered and said unto him, thou wicked and slotful servant. &gt;&gt; Thou kneest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I've not saw. The oughtters therefore to have put my money to the exchanges and there at my coming I should have received my own with Yer. They take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which had 10 talents. &gt;&gt; So the one that's being blessed is going to be be blessed more now because &gt;&gt; even taking from them now that even had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For unto everyone that had shall be given and he shall have abundance. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the one that's multiplying in the things that God has given him is going to have abundance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he had and cast ye the unprofitable servant unto outer darkness. There shall be weeping and nashing of teeth. Trust me this God is working in kingdom principle. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the kingdom of God. God don't run his kingdom like a country with a democracy. &gt;&gt; YES. GOD HAS GIVEN TASK TO everyone &gt;&gt; and he wants YOU TO BE PROFITABLE INTO HIS KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; You cannot run a company and have somebody an employee who is not profitable to your company. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He's a liability to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's not an asset to you. Now, God has entrusted us with certain certain talents because why? He wants us to be assets in his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS US TO GO FORTH, PREACH THE GOSPEL TO MULTIPLY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO TAKE THIS WORD FORTH, THIS WORD OF HOPE THAT WE HAVE, this blessed assurance. &gt;&gt; But some people are like like liability in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are a bad example to the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When people look at them and they are so negative all the time and they now imagine them carrying it. They notice people believe the message of the hour, but everything when they when they're around their families, when they're around their friends, when they're around the neighbors, they always negative, &gt;&gt; never talking about God, always complaining, always grumbling. &gt;&gt; Are they profitable to the kingdom? &gt;&gt; So, every person receives something. You see, God has given everyone something. &gt;&gt; No matter what what God has given you, you have something. Amen. So God gives us abilities, several abilities. He gives gifts. He give us revelation of his word. He's given us different testimony. Every one of us got a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So no one is empty-handed. No one is for excuse. &gt;&gt; So you find that in Matthew 25:16 and 17 speaks about the two faithful servants. They multiplied what they were given. &gt;&gt; So faithful is faithfulness is not about the size of your talent. It's about what you do with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But what did the unfaithful servant in Matthew 25:18 do? He buried the talent. &gt;&gt; SO MANY BELIEVERS BURY THE TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THEY BURY THE CALLING. &gt;&gt; THEY BURY THE PRAYER LIFE. &gt;&gt; THEY PRAY BURY THE GIFTS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN UNTO THEM. &gt;&gt; They bury the revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because why? When God has revealed something, they won't go and share it out. They wouldn't speak about it. and they BURY THEIR OPPORTUNITIES. GOD PRESENTS opportunities to them. Your family member is sick. Your loved one is sick. You have a case to go to the hospital and pray for somebody. You lose that opportunity. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Somebody brings up a topic at work about God, you you lose that opportunity. You shy away. &gt;&gt; Opportunities at your doorstep. &gt;&gt; So what that do? Fear makes people bury what God gave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says perfect love cast out all fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So after a long time the Lord cometh and reckon it to them. So every talent comes with a reckoning. We must give an account. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every talent we must give an account for. &gt;&gt; But there's a reward. Well done good and faithful servant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Reward is based on faithfulness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not giftedness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. So the but there's also a judgment for the unfaithfulness. Cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. So some will be out in out in spiritual danger in this hour. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in Matthew 6:33, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND ALL these things shall be added unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So as true steward lives with God's first priorities &gt;&gt; because why seek seek his kingdom first what what it means seek his will his purpose his word his righteousness his leadership &gt;&gt; amen then all these things what all these things shall be added to us the things that you want &gt;&gt; God has adds opportunities to you he adds favor to you he adds resources to you he opens doors where no man could shut &gt;&gt; amen Amen. He brings all these things to you, but he will not increase you spiritually until you put God first in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because a steward, a good steward, he has a kingdom vision. &gt;&gt; His decisions are revolve around Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you look in the Bible, we look at the life of Joseph and uh just I can see time is gone. I'm just going to go through quickly. The life of Joseph when he was in Portifer's house in Genesis 39 1-6 quickly I'll read that uh and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Portifer an officer of Pharaoh captain of the guard in Egyptian bought him of the hands bought him of the hands of the Ishelites which had brought him down thther and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man &gt;&gt; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian &gt;&gt; and his master saw that the Lord was with him and The Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand. &gt;&gt; And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him. And he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had put in his high hand. And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your company is going to be blessed. Yes. &gt;&gt; For your sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your family is going to BE BLESSED FOR YOUR SAKE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; And the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house &gt;&gt; and in the fields. And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and he knew not he had saved the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person. So you see, he managed another man's house. Didn't Jesus speak about this in Luke? Another man's wealth. You can't handle another man's things. But Joseph, he managed another man's house. But for entrusted everything to him &gt;&gt; AND JOSEPH INCREASED THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; When he managed his house, there was an increase in that house. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he lived in that house with integrity. &gt;&gt; He kept the he kept the word of he knew the prophecy. He kept the dreams that he had. Amen. He kept the vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what Luke was saying, if you're not being faithful in that which is another man, who shall give you that which is in your own? But look at Joseph now. He's keeping another man's house. &gt;&gt; But in that other man's house, he's being blessed. &gt;&gt; He's being prosperous. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But then Joseph goes through his testings. Amen. He continue his testings. So what that was his stewardship test. Then he goes into prison. We know what happens there. about the false witness of Portifer's wife ends up Joseph ends up in prison but God is now only taking him now to mold his character he's taking him to his training ground amen because now he's going to bring him to higher heights amen &gt;&gt; and in prison we sing in verses 23 39 chapter 39 verse 20 and 23 and Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison prison. But the Lord was with Joseph &gt;&gt; and showed him mercy and gave him favor. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the sight of the keeper of the prison. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So even in prison, Joseph had favor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; NOTHING. NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT circumstance you may be, YOU CAN HAVE GOD'S FAVOR UPON YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph and all the prisoners that were in the prison. And whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see a child of God when he's there walking in vision, walking with the vision in mind. Amen. Walking with the prophecy in mind. Wherever you're going to be is going to be blessed. Divine favor is going to be with you all all the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then verse 23, the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper. Amen. So even Joseph was falsely accused, but he served faithfully. &gt;&gt; And we know he still remained humble. He still kept his gift and he didn't come bitter. And because he didn't come bitter, because he was still humble, he's now going to end up using that gift &gt;&gt; for the better good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So what his faithfulness in adversity, what did it do? It produced his character &gt;&gt; that's going to take him to his destiny. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we find now in verses Genesis 41 38-44 there it speaks about Joseph in the palace and Pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of God is &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND PHARAOH SAID UNTO JOSEPH, for as much as God had showed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise at thou art. Thou shalt be ruler over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled. In other words, he's going to set the law in order. He's going to bring the word. Thou shall prophesy again of foundations and tongue. THIS BRIDE SHALL BECOME THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Only in the throne will I be greater than you. &gt;&gt; So in other words, he is the headstone. We're the body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll be the final voice in the final age. Amen. The only person that higher than us is the head which is Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, see I have said thee over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestues of fine linen and put a gold chain upon his neck. And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. And they cried before him, bow the knee. and he made him rule over all the land of Egypt. We know that I was typing Jesus, but he's also typing the bride when she's going to rule and reign with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now God could trust Joseph with the economy of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because why? Joseph was kept to preserve life. &gt;&gt; He was &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God gave him the wisdom that he could in the time of plenty, he could tell him to build the store houses. Yes. &gt;&gt; To store up the food. Because why? IN THE TIME OF FAMINE from the storehouse there was going to be food given. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The lineage. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE WAS A LINEAGE that had to be preserved. &gt;&gt; The very lineage that put him in the in the pit and sold him to the for slavery. &gt;&gt; That image, that lineage had to be preserved &gt;&gt; because from there come the patriarchs, come the prophets, come the lineage of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come the come the the priesthood and so forth. &gt;&gt; That lineage had to be preserved. But watch Joseph is now in authority. He was kept there to preserve life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; At one stage YOU WERE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE. YOU STARTED SPEAKING ABOUT THE VISION THAT YOU GOT. YOU started speaking about I'm going to go in the rapture. You started telling all your families, all your friends, I'm going to the rapture. I'm going to have a body change. I'm going to be the queen of heaven. What happened? They started to reject you. They started to be jealous of you. They started to be envious of your revelation. Those denominations and you started to get rejected from everyone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you remain humble. &gt;&gt; You didn't hate them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know why? Joseph knew the vision. He knew that he had to preserve lifes. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't hate his brethren. But look, watch in Genesis Genesis 45. It says, "Now therefore, be not grieved nor angry with yourself." is telling his brethren now that he sold me for God did send me before you to preserve life. &gt;&gt; They still conceal that sin. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And now it was troubling THEM ALL HIS YEARS. NOW THAT SAME CONCEALED SIN now because they did it with hatred then &gt;&gt; hatred towards Joseph &gt;&gt; and they concealed that hatred and now they are still living fearfully but perfect love cast away all fear. Joseph now is casting away all their fear, &gt;&gt; all their doubt, and he's telling them the prophecy now. It was done to preserve life. &gt;&gt; He's showing THEM THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT WAS DONE TO PRESERVE LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And you're going to SEE THE VERY FAMILIES that rejected you, the the people that rejected you for what you believe ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT. OH, THEY'RE GOING to realize the prophecy is going to be fulfilled that it was done to preserve life because to him that given a glass of water to one of these my little one shall surely not lose their reward. Oh, your your mother that was not saved, that done something for you, that preserved you, that nurtured you, your family members that did something for you, that because it was carrying that lineage, Amen. was carrying that seed, it was done to preserve life. On the day of judgment, you going to be judging the earth. Don't you know the sin shall judge the earth &gt;&gt; and on that day they're going to come they're going to be oh so they are I've rejected what this people told me I've rejected what they said but the little good that they did the little water they gave you the glass of water to one of these my little ones on the day of judgment life will be given &gt;&gt; eternal life will be given to him &gt;&gt; amen so Joseph was a type of Christ and by extension a type of us in the end times. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know Joseph his stewardship he proved his he was faithful in his stewardship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The stores the stores at the time it fed the world in famine. &gt;&gt; And we have a word that will that was stored up for us in this season AND IT WILL FEED the world in spiritual famine. Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why Revelation 10 10:11 says, "And he said unto me, thou must prophesy again before nation before many people and nation and tongues and kings." &gt;&gt; And Matthew 21, last scripture, Matthew 21:16 says, "And about the 11th hour, he went out and found other standing idle, and said unto them, why stand thee all the day idle?" They say unto him, because no man had hired us. He said unto them, "Give ye also into the vineyard." Sorry, go ye also into the vineyard. And whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. So when even was come, the Lord of the Bunny said unto his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last until the first. And when they came, they were hired about the 11th hour. They received every man a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more. And they likewise received even every man a penny. And when they had received it, they murmured against the good men of the house, saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou has made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden eat of the day. But he answered one of them, and said, friend, I do thee no wrong. Does not thou agree with me? for a penny. Take that is thine and go thy way. I will give unto this last even as unto thee. It is not is it not lawful for me to do what I will do with my own is thine. I evil because I am good. So that last shall be first and the first last for many will be called but few are chosen. So you see God is faithful. He is a faithful steward because he has given the people the same wages because he made an agreement with them. I'm giving you this and even when he has questioned even the 11th hour we have come now in the 11th hour it's a closing dispensation of this dispensation but we will be given the same amen so we are entrusted now with true riches. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 3 said that we are blessed with all spiritual blessings. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; So God is just shaping and molding and a character but we have to give an account of our stewardship. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the musicians. Let's stand our feet. Let me put up the song. Blessed assures is mine. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a foreign a glory divine hair of salvation.

We pray this morning. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, Lord, &gt;&gt; maybe Lord, I know now, Lord, that I've given accounts for all that you have belotted unto me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. But Lord, maybe I haven't been faithful. &gt;&gt; Or Lord, maybe I wasted time. Lord, &gt;&gt; I thought I've got enough time. &gt;&gt; Maybe Lord, I haven't had a consistent life. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Or I haven't been held accountable. &gt;&gt; But Father, this day, I want to be held accountable. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to be consistent in my walk with you. Lord, &gt;&gt; I want to be a faithful steward of all that you entrusted me with. Say yes oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord I want to look at the heavenly vision Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes God &gt;&gt; I want to look at the prophecy. &gt;&gt; And know Lord that I'm the final part now before the we leave the earth. The final part lays with me. The final part of the prophecy before the rapture lays with me where all nature, all creation is groaning and waiting and surveilling for the manifestation of the son of God. &gt;&gt; We're going to pray this morning. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; No one looking around. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord has spoken to you this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, God. &gt;&gt; You can make it right this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.

Lord, time is fast spent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't want to spend our lives recklessly. &gt;&gt; We don't want to live loosely, oh God. &gt;&gt; We want to live our lives in line with your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to live our lives knowing that we are doing something for your kingdom, Father. And we we want to live our lives where we're not just stagnant, Father. But we Lord, we want to measure our walk, measure our life along this journey. And Lord, knowing that there's progression along this walk, Father, we want to see a spiritual growth in our lives, Father. And we pray, Father, we know that we cannot do it on our own, Father. But Lord, we just want to be, Lord, lay ourselves in you, oh God, knowing that through you, we can do all things, Father. Oh, we know, Lord, the spirit of Christ is in us, Lord. You said in your word, greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world, Father. And through Christ Jesus, we can do all things, Father. And Lord, we pray for your children this morning, if they've taken heed to your word, Father. And I pray, Lord, that you now, Lord, you will they will, Lord, continue now, Lord, to want, Lord, to know more of to to to to do your will, oh God, and to fulfill your purpose in and through their lives, Father. I pray and ask it now in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. And we pray that you be blessed this morning. We hand a service now to God's servant pas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Yes. &gt;&gt; But he acted quickly. Amen. &gt;&gt; So read that story again. He acted quickly. So here's what the spirit is saying. Act quickly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's always room because the kingdom is run like a business. &gt;&gt; And God is looking for return on investment. Any businessman know ROI. &gt;&gt; Return on investment. &gt;&gt; So Jesus, if you're reading those stories, he's given about the stewardship. The man said, "Settle half at least. Let me show him I've got half at least." Amen. So act quickly. Salvage what you can &gt;&gt; and show it back to the Lord &gt;&gt; that his eye of favor will be turned to us. And then if also we got to look at the positive side. If we have been managing it properly, if we have been good stewards, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; then there's an increase coming because God can all lot more to us. &gt;&gt; It's not only the negative now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people are handling it properly. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then God's going to attribute more for it. So we thank the Lord for that. And then also be consistent and persistent. Amen. Be consistent. Start to read your Bible and pray every day. That's how you keep the calls of your Bible. &gt;&gt; Pray. Read your Bible every day. Amen. Let's sing. I'm pressing on the upward way.
