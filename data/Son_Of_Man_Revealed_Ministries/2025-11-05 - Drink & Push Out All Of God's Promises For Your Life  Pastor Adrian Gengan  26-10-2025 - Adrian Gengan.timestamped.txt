[0:00] Amen.
[0:01] &gt;&gt; Greet you all in the wonderful name of
[0:02] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[0:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Um it's truly our honor, privilege to
[0:09] worship the Lord and give him all the
[0:10] praise and glory.
[0:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Um
[0:14] so a few weeks ago when pastor said u
[0:19] said that we must prepare our
[0:21] testimonies I was very excited and I was
[0:24] like ready for it and
[0:27] &gt;&gt; I even said 15 minutes [clears throat]
[0:29] we laugh.
[0:31] So uh but the devil like tried to rob me
[0:34] of my joy and I felt sick and two weeks
[0:37] I didn't come to church and then
[0:42] I was I used to feel very tired and I
[0:44] couldn't explain why and uh so I just
[0:49] continued praying trusting God. But last
[0:52] night um I was done like meeting up the
[0:56] house and everything. I was sitting on
[0:57] the city and then he said that the only
[0:59] thing now is to get ready for church and
[1:01] keep clothes ready.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; And then I got up and then I felt this
[1:05] pain in my left arm. I couldn't explain
[1:07] it. I couldn't move my arm. I couldn't
[1:09] lift my arm. I I I just don't know what
[1:12] was wrong. So I went upstairs, shook
[1:14] hands and I don't know what's wrong. I
[1:17] can't move my arm. And he he says, "Do
[1:20] you want me to massage your arm? You
[1:21] want a pain tablet or something?" I
[1:23] said, "No, no, no. I don't want
[1:24] anything. I'll just uh lie down in bed."
[1:27] And then I just said a simple prayer,
[1:30] you know, faith and said, "Lord, I
[1:32] believe in you. I believe in your word
[1:34] and I can't understand what's happening,
[1:37] but I claim my healing.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; In your name and because you said by
[1:43] your stripes we were
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; So uh I slept I had a peaceful sleep
[1:48] slept through the night.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; Got up this morning my entire body was
[1:53] beating like I was beaten up. So I said
[1:56] now God what is this? And uh I said I'm
[2:01] still believing. I'm still
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; So I fell on my knees and started
[2:04] praying and I said Lord I claim my
[2:07] healing. Amen.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; And uh I opened my Bible and said,
[2:10] "Lord, speak to me." So I opened to
[2:12] Psalms 119
[2:14] &gt;&gt; and I said, "That's like such a powerful
[2:17] psalm. I was so blessed reading it." And
[2:20] I said, "Uh, I'll continue, Lord, just
[2:23] receiving." So I started walking around
[2:25] the house and walking outside and just
[2:27] praying and trusting God. And then I
[2:30] just started feeling better.
[2:33] So when I came upstairs, I told her I
[2:35] was getting hands off the church. No,
[2:37] I'm not feeling well. I can't make it
[2:39] today. So, I was very disappointed. And
[2:42] then I said, "No, but that's not going
[2:43] to stop [clears throat] me."
[2:45] &gt;&gt; And then uh I just continued the day and
[2:48] I started feeling better and just
[2:50] praising God. I said, "Thank you, Lord.
[2:51] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord."
[2:53] &gt;&gt; And I came to church and I could lift my
[2:55] arm

[18:33] Amen, for each one in the church this
[18:34] morning that the spirit of God will be
[18:36] able to bless each one.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says he's missing the
[18:39] fellowship. We certainly missing him.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we pray that the Lord will
[18:42] bring him back safely even with our
[18:44] sister Lily. Amen. Many people not share
[18:46] this morning as well. Amen. We pray that
[18:48] the Lord will still minister to them.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Their hearts thank you for the
[18:51] testimony, sister Jing. How many of you
[18:53] are taking what you are learning and
[18:55] applying it?
[18:57] &gt;&gt; By show of hands, how many of you have
[18:58] seen changes in your own life
[19:00] &gt;&gt; by applying the word?
[19:02] &gt;&gt; And how many of you have testimonies
[19:03] regarding that?
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then I want you now to not hold
[19:07] back the testimonies. It may be simple
[19:09] things like that woman whose flower kept
[19:14] multiplying.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; It seemed like a simple thing
[19:17] &gt;&gt; but the flower was multiplying
[19:19] &gt;&gt; in a horn house.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; So you must be able to speak these
[19:22] testimonies because testimonies breeds
[19:24] testimonies.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; That's how it works.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So keep your
[19:30] testimonies alive. Do you know that's
[19:31] how you keep your flame alive.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can't you know remember the
[19:35] olden days people couldn't wait. You
[19:37] could you had to tell in Abu you testify
[19:38] next week. We have too many testimonies
[19:40] today.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; And testimonies ought to be a part of
[19:44] our everyday life.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; Because we walk in the supernatural.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; We live in the supernatural. Let's read
[19:49] our scripture. Then you can be seated
[19:50] this morning. [clears throat] Amen.
[19:52] Praise the Lord. Let's go to John
[19:54] chapter 7
[20:00] verse 38.
[20:03] Amen.
[20:04] Our
[20:09] Lord Jesus is saying, "He that believeth
[20:12] on me," how many of you believe on the
[20:14] Lord?
[20:15] &gt;&gt; As the scripture said, out of his belly
[20:17] shall flow rivers of living water.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Out of his belly shall flow rivers
[20:24] of living water.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Our Lord is going to define that. Amen.
[20:27] As we read. Amen. We can [clears throat]
[20:30] maybe we read 37 there and then 30.
[20:33] Let's let's get to the I didn't type out
[20:35] all the word verses there, brother. If
[20:36] you can just get to that. So maybe we'll
[20:39] read from verse 37 there. It says, "In
[20:41] the last day, that great fe of the
[20:44] feast, Jesus stood and cried, if any man
[20:46] thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
[20:49] He that believeth on me, as the
[20:51] scripture had said, out of his belly
[20:53] shall flow living waters." Straight away
[20:55] we can see Jesus knew the scripture.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Because he's quoting back scripture.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Do we know our Bibles? Can we quote back
[21:02] scripture?
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Now, here he's going to define what he
[21:06] means. But this speak of the spirit
[21:10] which they that believe on him should
[21:12] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[21:14] given because that Jesus was not yet
[21:17] glorified. So this river that's going to
[21:19] be flowing out of us is the Holy Ghost.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's read also
[21:25] in St. John chapter 4 verse 13. We know
[21:28] a very popular scripture. The prophet
[21:31] preaches this time and time and again
[21:32] about the woman at the well. We'll get
[21:34] to verse 13 there. Jesus answered and
[21:37] said unto her, "Whosoever drinkketh out
[21:40] of this water shall thirst again."
[21:42] Talking about the natural well of Jacob
[21:44] there. But whosoever drinkketh of the
[21:47] water that I shall give him shall never
[21:49] thirst.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; We all establish that water is the Holy
[21:52] Ghost.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; But the water that I shall give him
[21:55] shall be in him a well of water
[21:57] springing up into everlasting life.
[22:00] Amen.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we get to one more portion
[22:03] before you are seated. Revelation 21 and
[22:05] verse 6.
[22:08] Amen. Revelation 21 and verse 6.
[22:16] Our Lord Jesus still speaking to John
[22:18] now, but now he's in a glorified body.
[22:21] And he said unto me, "It is done."
[22:24] On the cross, he said, "It is finished."
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Now he's saying, "It is done.
[22:29] I am alpha and omega.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; The beginning and the end.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; I will give unto him that is a thirst of
[22:37] the fountain of the water of life
[22:39] freely.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You may be seated.
[22:44] So the Holy Ghost is here to be poured
[22:46] out this morning and it's free.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; You just got to have a willing heart to
[22:50] receive it this morning.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[22:56] as we look at things in life, I want to
[22:58] remind you of what the prophet said. The
[23:00] prophet says that the rapture will take
[23:02] place.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; I believe between 6:00 and 9:00 some
[23:06] morning.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; I just want to remind you of that.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; Because that's our goal in sight.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; To make this
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; He's saying between 6:00 and 9 one
[23:20] morning.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe the prophet?
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know Jesus rose
[23:27] between 6:00 and 9 one morning?
[23:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; So,
[23:36] we were we were quoting this on
[23:38] Wednesday, but I didn't read it, but I
[23:40] want to read it this morning.
[23:43] He says, "We ought to be in action in
[23:46] respect to the word.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; God don't want people who are inactive.
[23:51] Yes.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; We ought to be in action.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; We ought to be telling people.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Signs of his coming, appearing
[24:03] everywhere. We see it push out in the
[24:05] word. We hear the HOLY SPIRIT COME TELL
[24:08] US CERTAIN THINGS. He's fixing to
[24:10] happen.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God wants to do something, he
[24:17] throws it up in the heavens.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He always shows it in
[24:21] the heavens first before he does it on
[24:22] the earth.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Now,
[24:26] [clears throat]
[24:27] we shouldn't be just drifting living
[24:29] life. If I come and ask you WHAT IS YOUR
[24:32] PLANS, WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE in life? I
[24:34] want you to be able to TELL ME WHAT YOUR
[24:35] PLAN IS, WHAT YOUR VISION IS, WHAT YOUR
[24:37] goal is.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be just drifting.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; The prophet is talking here about
[24:42] somebody who had come to the house and
[24:44] he told his wife to fix them something
[24:45] to eat. And his wife was scared of the
[24:47] man. He said, "Don't be scared." and he
[24:49] fixed him and then he start to talk to
[24:51] him and he asked what is your plans in
[24:52] life? Where you coming from? He says oh
[24:54] nowhere. Where you going? Oh nowhere.
[24:57] What's your plans? Uh nothing.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Uh we'll see. I want you to know WE'LL

[25:06] God.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; We'll see means YOU DON'T HAVE A VISION
[25:10] AND A PLAN.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying again? There
[25:14] are certain illegal words in the
[25:15] kingdom.
[25:19] WE GOT TO SPEAK VIA THE WORD OF GOD.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; JESUS ALWAYS QUOTED BACK THE WORD OF
[25:24] GOD.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; So he SAYS JUST DRIFTING. WE DON'T WANT
[25:30] TO DO THAT. You never got saved just to
[25:33] be a church member of a church. To be a
[25:35] member of a church. You got saved to
[25:36] work.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Now to work, you can't be lazy.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. WE DON'T DRESS UP AN
[25:44] ARMY JUST TO LAY AROUND ON THE CORNER.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; SURE.
[25:47] and flirt with the girls.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; You know, we were saying women like me
[25:55] men in uniform. Praise the Lord. Go ask
[25:58] sister Ela and Sister Jria. I mean,
[26:01] Sister Vanessa,
[26:04] they got men in uniform.
[26:07] Praise the Lord.
[26:10] But we're not here now to look pretty in
[26:12] our uniforms. [clears throat]
[26:15] We train an army to fight.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; I can't fight your battles.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; We are training an army FOR YOU TO FIGHT
[26:22] YOUR OWN BATTLES.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS EVERYTHING WAS
[26:26] GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, but
[26:27] they had to fight for every INCH OF
[26:29] GROUND.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT FOR OUR DELIVERANCE.
[26:32] WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT FOR OUR HEALING. WE
[26:34] GOT TO FIGHT FOR OUR SALVATION. AMEN.

[26:37] POWERS AND FIGHT.

[26:45] victory. How? We fight, we overcome.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; So, we're not here to flirt with girls
[26:50] in an army uniform. We train our army to
[26:54] fight. We're not on a picnic. We're on a
[26:56] battleground.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, put your sandwiches

[27:12] DON'T CALL the lazy.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T USE DON'T use those who are
[27:16] sitting around doing nothing. This is
[27:18] not the quote of the prophet. This is my
[27:19] notes.

[27:23] CARE OF SHEEP.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; When God called Elisha, he was walking
[27:26] in the field.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; When God called ISAIAH WAS IN THE TEMPLE
[27:29] burning incense, when the Lord asked,
[27:31] "Who can I send?" And he said, "Here am
[27:33] I. Send me."
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. OUR LORD JESUS EVEN AT 12 YEARS
[27:38] was at the temple saying, "I MUST BE
[27:39] ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS." AMEN.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. Even Even when THE
[27:45] LORD CALLED PETER, JAMES, AND JOHN, they
[27:47] were WORKING IN THEIR FATHER'S BUSINESS.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. They were about their
[27:51] father's fishing business. AND WHEN GOD
[27:53] CALLED OUR PROPHET, AMEN. He was already
[27:56] having healing revivals.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[28:15] THAT HE WILL SEND LABORERS INTO THE
[28:16] VINEYARD
[28:17] &gt;&gt; because the harvest is ripe, but the
[28:18] laborers are few."
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Too much lazy people in the KINGDOM
[28:22] DON'T WANT TO WORK. AMEN. NOT EXCITED
[28:24] ABOUT THEIR OWN SALVATION THAT I'VE GOT
[28:25] TO TELL SOMEBODY.

[28:34] SAID, "I CAN'T KEEP THIS TO MYSELF. I'VE
[28:36] GOT TO TELL SOMEBODY." AMEN.

[31:13] currently now? I I've just summarized
[31:15] some of the thoughts the prophet had and
[31:17] we're going to take the highlights of
[31:18] his thoughts to show where we are in the
[31:20] message right now. This might take a few
[31:22] moments, but I don't want to dwell on it
[31:24] too long because this is not the point
[31:26] of my message. My message this morning,
[31:28] drink. We speaking about that living

[31:37] &gt;&gt; It's laying within us.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; But we've got to push it out of us.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says the message
[31:44] today is those who obtain it in their
[31:47] hearts must lay in the presence of the
[31:49] sun to get ripened.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Which means it's green.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; You see them selling mangoes now. Green
[31:57] mangoes.
[31:59] Some of you like green mangoes because
[32:00] you make mango pickle.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; But that's not the state. It's end
[32:04] product is
[32:05] &gt;&gt; the end product is must lay in the
[32:07] presence OF THE SUN TO RIPE BECAUSE
[32:08] THERE'S NOTHING BETTER than a ripe
[32:10] mango.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:16] Maybe you're taking something NOW. HEAR
[32:18] WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING this morning.
[32:19] You may like mango with your chili
[32:21] powder.
[32:27] You may like mango with your salt,
[32:29] &gt;&gt; but that's not its intended design,
[32:34] &gt;&gt; you've stopped the process,
[32:36] &gt;&gt; you've pickled it.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; It's supposed to lay in THE PRESENCE OF
[32:40] THE sun until it is ripe.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; So he says, Amen. Let's follow his
[32:51] thought now. plenty green.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; We haven't. Now, what does green mean,
[32:56] brother Brandon? He's saying green means
[32:58] we don't have sincerity.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; We don't have sacredness. THE THING WE
[33:03] OUGHT TO HAVE IN OUR MIDST.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; SO, if eating green mango means we are
[33:09] not, we don't have sacredness.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; We don't have sincerity.
[33:16] He says, "And then you lay yourselves
[33:18] right in his presence and just make love
[33:20] to him." How do we do that? We talk to
[33:22] the Lord. Oh Lord Jesus,
[33:24] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Tender my heart, Lord.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Take away all the filth and the love of
[33:29] the world and let me live holy in this
[33:31] present world before you.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; See, then he goes on to say, OUR FAITH
[33:40] ISN'T RIPE. SO, people have green faith.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Faith is not ripe. So, is he saying you
[33:47] DON'T HAVE FAITH? NO. YOU GOT THE MANGO,
[33:49] BUT IT'S GREEN.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; YEAH. YOU'VE GOT FAITH, BUT IT'S NOT
[33:53] RIPE.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; YES.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; INTELLECTUALLY, we're hearing THE
[33:56] MESSAGE OF GOD has given us
[33:58] &gt;&gt; and seeing the signs that he's shown us,
[34:00] proving it by the Bible. It's there, but
[34:02] all out the church needs to lay in the
[34:04] pres in his presence till it tenders up,
[34:06] you know, and get sweet in your spirit.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Let's make that mango sweet.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; LET'S RIPEN that faith this morning.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You can pick up
[34:18] the message and then let the sun now
[34:20] watch. He doesn't use su n there. He
[34:22] uses s o n BAKE ALL THE GREENNESS OUT OF
[34:24] YOU. SEE, MAKING YOU MATURED CHRISTIAN.
[34:28] GOD IS COMING SOON to receive his
[34:29] church. And we must have that type of
[34:31] Christians for him to receive.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; So God is NOT COMING FOR GREEN MANGO.
[34:35] GOD IS COMING FOR RIPE.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm not calling you a
[34:41] mango now.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; God is coming for ripe mature
[34:44] Christians.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[34:47] [snorts]
[34:48] Amen.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; The wheat has got to get RIPE TILL IT
[34:53] BECOMES so ripe to Christ it become
[34:56] bread on the table. Ah
[34:58] &gt;&gt; you see most people like to say we are
[35:00] the wheat we are the wheat. He's saying
[35:01] now the wheat must progress go through
[35:03] its process where it becomes bread on
[35:04] the table.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the prophet now not me.
[35:09] The word to be ripened in your heart to
[35:11] bring forth and live what we are talking
[35:13] about.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:15] I'm waiting for that day where I'll
[35:18] speak and it'll create.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when that day is now.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; The time is now.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; What's use I come to marriage supper
[35:28] there and I speak.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; What's use you sick here now but I don't
[35:34] pray for you now. And I come there in
[35:35] the marriage supper and say bro you
[35:36] remember you were sick there on the
[35:38] earth
[35:38] &gt;&gt; but now in your new body.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; There's no need for me to pray for you
[35:44] then. Exactly.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Now is when we must work for the
[35:46] kingdom.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] We have a lot to
[35:50] cover this morning and I want to move
[35:51] fast. Amen.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; So, we got to understand like we've been
[35:55] speaking over the last few weeks. GOD
[35:57] HAS DONE EVERYTHING for us.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; It's all been done.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; We just read how Jesus said it is done.
[36:06] Jesus on the cross said it is finished.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have got to now receive it.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. and start TO LIVE IT OUT.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; LIKE THAT BOY WAS PARDONED. HE DIDN'T
[36:15] WANT TO RECEIVE IT.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Like when I'm telling you, YOU'RE
[36:18] WITHOUT SPOT, WITHOUT WRINKLE, WITHOUT
[36:19] BLEMISH.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT BLAME, people don't receive it.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; No, it can't be. I must still do
[36:25] something.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU'RE NOT RECEIVING YOUR PARDON.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible in in Galatians chapter 3 THAT
[36:30] SAYS WE ARE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD
[36:32] THROUGH CHRIST.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:36] So he DID EVERYTHING FOR US. IN HEBREWS
[36:39] 12:2 IT says we are looking unto Jesus
[36:42] the author and finisher of our faith who
[36:45] for the joy that was set before him.
[36:47] Let's stop there. Who was the joy that
[36:49] was set before Jesus at the cross?
[36:54] &gt;&gt; He knew me when he was on the cross. I
[36:58] &gt;&gt; you and I were on his mind.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; The joy that was set before him
[37:02] &gt;&gt; was you.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Let's understand the scripture. He's
[37:06] saying THERE WAS A JOY THAT WAS SET
[37:07] BEFORE HIM.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[37:12] The joy that was set BEFORE HIM ENDURED
[37:14] THE CROSS.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; YES.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; HE SAID A PICTURE OF HIS LOVELY WIFE.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; He saw us.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I'LL DIE FOR HER."
[37:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THANK YOU.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Never mind. WHEN I WAKE UP 5:00 IN THE
[37:27] MORNING, GO TO WORK. I'm picturing my
[37:30] wife, swiping my card, HAPPY FOR THE JOY
[37:35] THAT SET BEFORE ME. I'LL ENDURE.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Despising the shame. AND HE SAT DOWN AT
[37:45] the right hand of God.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the joy of God.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God don't like TO SEE
[37:52] HIS JOY LOOKING SAD THIS MORNING. God
[37:55] don't like your SUDDEN LOOK.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; How many of you have the joy OF THE
[38:00] LORD?
[38:01] &gt;&gt; WELL, HOW ABOUT WE LET OUR FACE KNOW
[38:02] ABOUT IT?
[38:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Come on, smile. Somebody
[38:05] smile.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know when you can't
[38:10] smile?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; When you're there in the coffin now.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Please, you're alive now. I want to see
[38:15] your smile.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. WE OUGHT TO HAVE JOY.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE OUGHT TO BE HAPPY PEOPLE. AMEN.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WE CAN'T BE LIKE
[38:26] PHARISEES JUST KEEP that so you know so
[38:28] reverent look. No,
[38:31] &gt;&gt; we can't be so heavenly minded that we
[38:32] know earthly good.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; That's correct. Amen.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; No earthly good.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Everyone afraid to come talk to you
[38:40] &gt;&gt; because you know you get a lecture now.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's be earthly
[38:46] good. Let's encourage one another.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[38:51] So we are the his victory and the reason
[38:53] for his death. Do you know that we are
[38:55] the central theme
[38:58] of what God is doing on the earth now?
[39:01] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about born again sons and
[39:03] daughters of God. I'm talking about the
[39:05] wife of the Lord Jesus Christ. You are
[39:07] the CENTRAL THEME OF WHAT GOD IS DOING
[39:09] ON THE EARTH. NOW,
[39:11] &gt;&gt; YES.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; When God is dealing with Russia, when
[39:14] God is dealing with Ukraine, when God is
[39:16] dealing there with the Pope, and God is
[39:18] dealing there with the USA, those are
[39:22] what they call them for actors.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; They're not the main actor.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; They are extras.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; But the main the main central theme
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; is you.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's put it another way. What is
[39:40] God's program for today? Who is walking
[39:43] in God's program for today?
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; We are working OUT GOD'S PROGRAM FOR
[39:48] TODAY.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; YES, that's right.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; And all the others are actors.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; God is going to use them soon to put a
[39:54] squeeze.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; How many of you know what a squeeze is
[39:56] for?
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Is to see what's inside.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, where is victory? REASON FOR
[40:04] HIS DEATH. And Christ we know is a
[40:07] central theme of the Bible. And right
[40:09] now in 2025, Christ is in me. So I
[40:12] become the central theme.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Yes, Lord.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Christ is forming me, making me the
[40:19] central theme. Let's go to the court for
[40:21] those of you who don't believe me. He
[40:22] says, look, Christ in you makes him the
[40:24] center of life of the revelation.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; So Christ lives in you makes him the
[40:30] center of the revelation. Christ in the
[40:32] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[40:33] revelation of Christ. Christ in you
[40:36] makes you the complete revelation of the
[40:38] whole thing.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; See what God's trying to do.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know a lot of you like to be
[40:45] like the main actor.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:50] How many of you like to be main actor?
[40:53] &gt;&gt; You know when you went
[40:55] talk about when you were younger now and
[40:57] you watched Bruce Lee now you watch a
[41:00] kung fu movie. when you came out there
[41:02] of the movie. Now you are Bruce Lee.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; How many of you did that when you were
[41:09] &gt;&gt; amen
[41:12] [clears throat] look?
[41:14] You felt like you were Bruce Lee. Why?
[41:17] You saw an image that was placed before
[41:19] you and you wanted to be like that. Then
[41:22] for a little while
[41:25] you started that spirit got on you. You
[41:26] started to act like Bruce Lee
[41:29] until maybe your brother gave you one
[41:30] smack and then you came back down to
[41:32] being you. Praise the Lord.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; So the point I'm trying to make is you
[41:39] are the central theme right now. You are
[41:41] the main actor.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; You are not. Amen. An extra.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:48] So the purpose of why the seals were
[41:51] open, if I can summarize it, is to
[41:53] expose the right of the enemy to show
[41:55] you that Satan is already defeated.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; To show you THAT HE'S ALREADY POWERLESS
[42:01] &gt;&gt; AND TO SHOW YOU THAT HE IS DEFEATED. The
[42:03] seals WERE OPEN TO ALSO REVEAL YOUR TRUE
[42:05] IDENTITY.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; CAN TAKE YOU in the back PART OF GOD'S
[42:07] MIND AND SHOW YOU YOU ARE ETERNAL AS GOD
[42:10] IS ETERNAL.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; You know that's in the message. Amen.
[42:15] Hallelujah. It came now to tell you that
[42:18] YOU CAN OVERCOME THIS WORLD. Christ has
[42:20] given you the victory THROUGH CHRIST.
[42:22] GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME than he that
[42:24] is in the world.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; The seals came to REVEAL OUR TRUE
[42:27] IDENTITY and to break Amen. open our
[42:30] understanding that we were created in
[42:31] the image of God. And that means TO BE
[42:33] LIKE GOD. That means to have dominion
[42:35] over the earth. That means to have
[42:37] amenity
[42:39] over every circumstance, over every
[42:41] situation, over every sickness, over
[42:43] every trial.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; You see how the enemy was trying to
[42:47] whisper to suggest
[42:51] &gt;&gt; first he attacked her in her body.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Then brother Kenzo didn't want to come
[42:56] to church.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; So she could have easily said no.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not going today.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Then now what what happened? I've got
[43:05] this in my notes. We're going to read it
[43:07] now. What did she start to do? She said
[43:09] she started to walk around.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; The prophet told us we've been through
[43:12] this now and act like you're healed.
[43:13] Yeah.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Speak like you're healed.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Believe like you're healed. And he says
[43:17] your body has got to obey your
[43:19] confession.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; That's what's happened today.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Your body had to obey your confession.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T CRAWL UP IN ONE CORNER THERE.
[43:27] NOW, OH, a nice day. I'll eat this
[43:30] perfect weather. This
[43:33] &gt;&gt; I can just lay here and sleep.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Because now I got a alibi. I'm sick.
[43:38] Everyone can see I'm sick.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But no, faith rises
[43:43] above that.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Now, we got to realize also THAT WE HAVE
[43:50] UNLIMITED POTENTIAL LAYING WITHIN US.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; We have UNLIMITED POTENTIAL LAYING
[43:56] WITHIN US. We know about untapped
[43:58] resources.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; But we talk about it AS IF IT'S SOME
[44:01] SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE UNTAPPED RESOURCES
[44:03] IS WITHIN US BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST IS
[44:05] WITHIN US.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So we have unlimited potential AND
[44:09] OUR IMAGINATION, OUR THOUGHTS, OUR AMEN
[44:12] THINKING OUGHT TO MATCH GOD'S THINKING.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; God did not have a small imagination.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now you say, what's
[44:22] imagination? Imagination, listen to
[44:25] this, is the ability to form you ideas,
[44:29] &gt;&gt; images or concepts of things that are
[44:32] not concurrently perceived through the
[44:34] senses.
[44:37] Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; You can't see it with the five senses.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; But you ARE ABLE TO CREATE THIS IMAGE,
[44:47] &gt;&gt; this life in your mind,
[44:49] &gt;&gt; this well body.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet says, "Set your
[44:52] well body before you
[44:54] &gt;&gt; and he says, walk to it."
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we KNOW THAT FAITH IS A
[45:00] SUBSTANCE OF THINGS hoped for.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:06] Faith is a substance of things HOPE FOR.
[45:08] WHAT IS HOPE? Hope is the desire.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Hope is the imagination.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; But just hope alone. God didn't just
[45:16] leave it in his thoughts in THE
[45:17] BEGINNING. WHATEVER WAS in his thoughts,
[45:20] he had to speak it AND LET IT
[45:21] MATERIALIZE.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; And he SPOKE IT BY FAITH.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAYS IT COULD BE MAYBE A
[45:26] HUNDREDS AND BILLIONS OF YEARS. BUT HE
[45:28] SPOKE THAT WORD EXPECTING TO SEE LIGHT.
[45:31] When he said, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." HE
[45:33] SPOKE HIS OWN WORDS AND HE BELIEVED HIS
[45:35] OWN WORDS.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE SPOKEN WORDS. AMEN. EXPECT TO
[45:38] RECEIVE WHAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Faith is the SUBSTANCE
[45:43] OF THINGS HOPED FOR, THE EVIDENCE OF
[45:46] THINGS not seen.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT DON'T LEAVE THINGS IN a hope
[45:50] state. START TO SPEAK IT BY FAITH.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; START TO APPLY IT BY FAITH. FAITH
[45:55] WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; START TO TAKE ACTION.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Prepare for it.
[46:02] Amen. Hallelujah. We are we've been
[46:05] speaking on Wednesday. We are
[46:06] supernatural beings.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; We are a being, BUT WE ARE SUPERNATURAL
[46:10] BEING.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'm not a human being. I HAVE THE
[46:13] HOLY GHOST living in me. The prophet
[46:15] says we become a twofold being.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the earth to die, but one
[46:20] of heaven to live.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm a twofold being.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be looking at the outer
[46:25] senses HERE IN THE BODY THAT'S DECAYING.
[46:27] AMEN. BUT I'M NOT AN ORDINARY PERSON.
[46:29] I'M A SUPERNATURAL BEING WITH A
[46:32] SUPERNATURAL FAITH AND I'M OPERATING
[46:34] WITH SUPERNATURAL INTELLIGENCE.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. WHY IS THERE SUCH A
[46:39] PUSH? ASK YOURSELF, WHY IS THERE SUCH A
[46:41] PUSH IN this time and season NOW FOR
[46:43] ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?
[46:45] &gt;&gt; EVEN THEIR VERY WORD SHOWS YOU IT'S
[46:47] ARTIFICIAL.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; SO SOMEBODY TELL ME IF ARTIFICIAL MEANS
[46:50] A COUNTERFEIT, WHERE [applause] IS the
[46:52] devil?
[46:53] &gt;&gt; There must be supreme intelligence on
[46:55] that. There must [cheering] be a supreme
[46:57] [applause] intelligence. a super
[46:58] intelligence on the earth now.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. AMEN.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; GOD SHOWED IT. AMEN. Back then,
[47:05] &gt;&gt; GOD SHOWED A SIGN OF THE SUPREME
[47:07] INTELLIGENCE.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Show me a pillar of
[47:12] fire. I'M NOT LOOKING FOR THE PILLAR OF
[47:13] FIRE TO BE TAKEN OVER MY HEAD. THE
[47:15] PILLAR OF FIRE IS IN ME. AMEN. IT'S LIKE
[47:18] FIRE SHUT UP IN MY BONES.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; OH, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[47:22] PRAISE THE LORD.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; People are looking for signs. Amen.
[47:26] People are looking FOR PICTURES AND WHAT
[47:28] ARE THEY DOING? They're puffing
[47:29] themselves up.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE PREPPING THEMSELVES UP. LOOK.
[47:32] LOOK. THIS is
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Look at what what's happened. Did I jump
[47:35] and cause that?
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm glad I caused some
[47:39] movement here.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. People are trying to say, "Look,
[47:48] PICTURE, LOOK THIS. NO, I WANT TO SEE
[47:50] THE HOLY GHOST INSIDE of you."
[47:51] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NOW IS NOT THE TIME OF GOD ABOVE
[47:54] US. YES.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Now we got the time of God with us.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Now it's THE TIME OF GOD IN US.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. [clears throat]
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. SO WHY THE PUSH FOR ARTIFICIAL
[48:05] INTELLIGENCE? ARTIFICIAL intelligence is
[48:08] changing the world AND IT'S ABOUT TO
[48:09] CHANGE THE WORLD IN WAYS WE can't even
[48:11] imagine.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; That's what they say. DO YOU KNOW EVEN
[48:15] THE CREATORS OF ARTIFICIAL intelligence
[48:18] are now the the founders of it are now
[48:20] sending messages to say, "Hey, be
[48:22] careful."
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Sure. It's too powerful.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; It's too dangerous.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; What it can do?
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Satan is always TRYING TO IMPERSONATE
[48:34] WHAT GOD IS DOING.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Satan is not doing a new thing. You
[48:38] know, Satan works through science. Satan
[48:40] is not doing a new thing now with
[48:41] artificial intelligence. He's trying to
[48:43] copy what God is doing with supreme
[48:46] intelligence.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. We learning these
[48:50] things because the prophet taught us how
[48:52] to think like this. He's a copycat.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; He knows that supreme intelligence is on
[48:57] the earth now.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; And the Holy GHOST IS THE DEITY WITHIN
[49:01] US.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; WE ARE AWAKENING TO OUR true potential.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Why do you think HE SAYS THEY'LL STOP
[49:06] CANCER?
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Do you know that they say that
[49:08] artificial intelligence will be able to
[49:10] read your DNA and all the faulty cells,
[49:12] it'll be able to fix it.
[49:16] [crying]
[49:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; That's what they are saying.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:20] They can fix the gene in YOU AND TAKE
[49:22] OUT ALL THE BAD GENES THAT YOUR CHILDREN
[49:24] WON'T GROW UP with these things.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN ALSO FIX THE GENE THAT IF YOU
[49:29] WANT BLUE EYES.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Or green eyes.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; They can fix it and code it
[49:35] &gt;&gt; in the gene.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; But man has stepped into God's
[49:40] laboratory.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Man has stepped into God's laboratory.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[49:49] And so he knows that NOW WE AWAKENING TO
[49:51] OUR true potential. Let me tell you the
[49:54] supreme intelligence that's laying
[49:56] within you. You're leaving there
[49:57] untapped. [crying]
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; We are living beneath our God-given
[50:03] privileges BECAUSE WE DON'T REALIZE THE
[50:05] POWER IS WITHIN US.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; OUT OF ME IS THROWING THIS WELLSPRING OF
[50:10] LIVING WATER.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; I NEED to drink.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know water carries
[50:17] pressure? Yes.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Water is full of pressure.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Carries pressure. Flowing water. Amen.
[50:28] It carries pressure. Pressure. Pressure.
[50:30] Praise the Lord. Even when you go, even
[50:32] in a stagnant pool, if you go to the
[50:35] bottom, there's pressure there.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we we are looking now and we
[50:44] are seeing we identifying supreme
[50:46] intelligence is in us.
[50:48] We have got to learn how to operate
[50:49] supreme intelligence.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Jes, our Lord knew this.
[50:54] If you put up St. John 14:12 there,
[50:57] Jesus knew the potential that lays in
[51:00] supreme intelligence.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; That's why he says, "Amen." 14:12.
[51:04] [clears throat]
[51:06] Praise the Lord.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; St. John 14:12. Go. It's not in the
[51:09] notes. You can just find it on the
[51:11] message the search or your Bible search.
[51:13] He says, "He that believeth on me, the
[51:17] works that I do shall he do also." Now,
[51:20] most of the time we jump to the second
[51:21] part of this. I'm saying let's match the
[51:23] first part first.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying the ones who believe on
[51:28] him.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe on him?
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; So, he's telling you your potential
[51:33] right now. The works that I do shall he
[51:36] do also.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; You mean uh Jesus healed the blind man?
[51:40] Yes.
[51:41] He's saying the works that I do, you
[51:43] must do also.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; You mean Jesus healed a deaf man?
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. The works that he did, you must do
[51:48] also.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; You see, message people have been taught
[51:51] that we can't operate like this.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; It's something we've been told that that
[51:56] only the prophet could do these things.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; I don't know where they got it because
[52:01] the prophet, you won't find it in the
[52:02] message.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; When it came to a one man scripture,
[52:05] ONLY ONE MAN could be Elijah the
[52:07] prophet. Yes.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. ONLY ONE MAN COULD BE
[52:10] Revelation 10:7, the seventh angel.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Only one man could be Revelation 3.
[52:14] Amen. The seventh CHURCH AGE MESSENGER.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; ONLY ONE MAN COULD BE used of God
[52:18] according to Luke 17:30, a son of man
[52:21] revealing the son OF MAN.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; BUT NOWHERE ELSE DO YOU FIND THE PROPHET
[52:25] saying
[52:27] that you are limited.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; He'll tell you every one of you has the
[52:33] authority to pray for somebody.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord.
[52:41] So he says here, Amen.
[52:43] AND GREATER WORKS. WHY GREATER? THE ONE
[52:46] THAT IS GOING TO COME ON THE DAY OF
[52:47] PENTECOST IS SUPREME INTELLIGENCE.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Please get this.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; The one that is coming now on the day of
[52:55] Pentecost, greater works than these
[52:58] shall he do because I go unto my father.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:05] How many of you know the things of God
[53:06] only get greater?
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; It may move in a minority. It's coming
[53:12] to a pyramid needle point now. But the
[53:14] potential that's lying there is greater
[53:16] potential.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's move on. Amen. So, we are
[53:20] talking now about this. And and like
[53:22] Jesus said, the spirit of the Lord is
[53:23] upon me. I'm going to teach you how to
[53:25] speak.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; The spirit, YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SAY,
[53:28] "THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME."
[53:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. YES.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN.

[53:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; He had anointed me
[53:45] &gt;&gt; to take the book and eat the book.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; He has ANOINTED ME TO STOP SICKNESSES,
[53:50] TO STOP DISEASE, TO STOP CANCER, TO
[53:53] START HEART DISEASE, STOP HEART
[53:54] DISEASES.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. Let me preach the
[54:00] revelation of my faith. Amen. The spirit
[54:02] of the Lord is upon me to preach this
[54:03] year. Amen. That this is THE YEAR OF
[54:05] JUBILEE to open up prison doors to the
[54:07] whole those THAT ARE HELD CAPTIVE. AMEN.
[54:09] BY THE ENEMY. I am here to make the mute
[54:11] speak.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; I am here to [applause] make the mute
[54:17] speak.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; You say, "WHAT MUTE ARE YOU TALKING
[54:19] ABOUT?" WE HAVE WE HAVE HAD TOO MANY
[54:21] PEOPLE IN THE message that were mute.
[54:24] But I'm HERE TO PUT THE POWER OF GOD
[54:26] WITHIN YOU TO IGNITE THAT FLAME WITHIN
[54:28] YOU. To make people THAT HAVE NOT BEEN
[54:30] OPERATING THE WORD THAT NOT HAVE BEEN
[54:32] ABLE TO SPEAK THE WORD, I am here to
[54:34] make the mute speak.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; I'm here TO MAKE THE DEAF HEAR.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SAY, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY
[54:40] MAKING THE DEAF HEAR?" AMEN. AMEN. I'M
[54:42] HERE TO MAKE YOU KNOW THE SPIRIT OF THE
[54:44] LORD IS UPON ME TO MAKE YOU SPEAK
[54:46] ACCORDING TO MARK 11:23.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; You know, Amen. PRIOR TO THAT, WE'VE HAD
[54:53] MANY TESTIMONIES in the church down
[54:54] through the ages. Amen.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Down through the years,
[54:58] &gt;&gt; WE'VE HAD MANY TESTIMONIES. BUT IN 2023,
[55:00] AMEN. THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CAME TO US
[55:03] AND HE REVEALED HIMSELF TO US IN A
[55:04] SPECIFIC WAY THAT WE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF
[55:07] HIS PRESENCE.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Those of YOU THAT WERE HERE WILL KNOW
[55:11] WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THOSE OF YOU
[55:12] THAT ARE HERE, CAN you testify by
[55:14] raising your hand in the air that you've
[55:15] seen the angel of the Lord? Amen.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The angel OF THE LORD
[55:21] IS HERE TO MAKE YOU SPEAK ACCORDING TO
[55:23] MARK 11:23. TO MAKE YOU SPEAK ACCORDING
[55:25] TO MARK 9:23, THAT ALL THINGS ARE
[55:28] POSSIBLE TO THEM THAT BELIEVE.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The spirit OF THE LORD IS HERE TO
[55:33] MAKE AMEN. TO OPEN UP BLIND EYES. AMEN.
[55:35] BLINDED BY WHAT?
[55:37] &gt;&gt; TO MAKE US SEE. AMEN. WHAT GOD HAS MADE
[55:39] US IN CHRIST.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; To open up these blind eyes. Amen.
[55:43] Hallelujah. The prophet says when you
[55:46] are born again, now
[55:48] listen to this. Now this is the main
[55:50] crux of what we are saying this morning.
[55:53] When you are born again and the baptism
[55:54] of the Holy Ghost has come into your
[55:56] heart, you have everything you have need
[55:59] for the journey.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of is for the
[56:04] journey.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Think of that apple seed. Now every
[56:07] apple it'll ever produce is in the seed.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Now pay attention to the words of the
[56:13] prophet and apply it to your life.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; He says everything you need. Now, he's
[56:19] he's not saying what you need in heaven.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Everything you need for your earthly
[56:26] journey.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; He says he's the exhaustable,
[56:31] inexhaustible fountain of life.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Right. When you receive the Holy Ghost,
[56:36] everything you've got need of between
[56:38] here and glory is right. Amen. In you
[56:41] then. M
[56:42] &gt;&gt; so whatever you need he says from here
[56:45] till the time you are taken away is in
[56:48] you.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; You were made in the image of God. You
[56:57] are like God.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Before God spoke in Genesis 1 that
[57:03] everything the earth, the sun, the moon
[57:04] and everything was all in him.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Everything was in him.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. It existed in him in his thoughts.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; There was nothing out there.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; But he spoke it out.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting what I'm saying.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Everything for your life's journey is in
[57:25] you.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; So, he's saying whatever you need
[57:31] between here and glory is right in you.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; It ain't faith you need.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Remember the faith is green.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; You got the faith. It's green.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; You got faith. If you got the Holy Ghost
[57:45] &gt;&gt; for he is your faith. But the thing you
[57:47] HAVE TO KNOW IS HOW TO USE THAT FAITH.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; You've got to know how to use that
[57:56] faith.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; See, he goes on to say, "Everything you
[58:03] have need of was put in you when you
[58:04] received the Holy Ghost for your life's
[58:06] journey."
[58:07] Notice life's journey.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Pay attention because this is going to
[58:11] change your life.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; This is GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY
[58:14] you think.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of when you
[58:19] receive the Holy Ghost for your life's
[58:20] journey. That's right. For your healing,
[58:23] for your salvation, for your joy, for
[58:25] your happiness.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Where is it coming out? OUT OF THE
[58:29] SOURCE.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; OUT OF THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATER, OUT
[58:32] OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS NOW GO TO PUSHING, GO TO
[58:38] DRINKING, go to stirring, go to reaching
[58:41] out DEEPER DEPTHS, HIGHER HEIGHTS. It's
[58:43] all there.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; It didn't NEED SOME DIVINE HEALER TO
[58:51] COME HEAL YOU, Sister J. Shri.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm glad the testimony came because
[58:56] here's a witness, right,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; brother Josh? What did I tell you on
[58:59] Friday? I said, "We have so many people
[59:02] sitting with testimonies here. Bear me
[59:04] witness."
[59:05] &gt;&gt; And I said, "I'm afraid because I know
[59:07] you come tell my wife.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; You'll all testify to my wife. You're
[59:15] raising her faith. [laughter]
[59:17] She tell me in the car and she tell me
[59:19] at home.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; But I want you to come here and
[59:23] testify."
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; You need to come here and testify.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Because where where was your healing?
[59:35] It was in you,
[59:36] &gt;&gt; you had to speak it out of you.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Josh, where's your healing?
[59:41] &gt;&gt; In you,
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The prophet says when
[59:46] Satan comes with your name on it
[59:48] &gt;&gt; and he's got your address on it
[59:51] &gt;&gt; and he comes here and says, "Look, it's
[59:53] your name on the package.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR ADDRESS. THANK YOU.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST SIGN FOR IT. He says refuse to
[59:59] sign for it.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; No, man.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; But yeah, I got Charles Marimu.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Say wrong person.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got WRONG PERSON.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; DON'T ACCEPT. SAY THAT'S NOT my name.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; I am Adrien Christ.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; I AM ROMESH THE CHRIST.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; I AM JOSHUA THE CHRIST.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Do you know what having the Holy Ghost
[1:00:24] means? Yeah.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Christ means the anointed one.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; So when they got your name there
[1:00:29] attached to it, you can immediately
[1:00:31] refuse it.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Because when you are in Christ plus you
[1:00:34] are the married wife of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:36] Christ, you take on his name. So tell
[1:00:38] him, "Sorry, I AM YOU ARE TALKING.
[1:00:40] YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DELIVER THIS PACKAGE
[1:00:41] TO SOMEBODY WHO DIED YEARS AGO.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE OLD MAN.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; That's the old man."
[1:00:49] [applause and cheering]
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; And even if you ACCEPTED IT, YOU CAN
[1:00:52] ALWAYS RETURN TO SENDER. AMEN.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; In fact, they come very quick and they
[1:00:56] return the career. They send their own
[1:00:58] career company. When you tell them you
[1:00:59] want to return it.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't believe me?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; They are subject to your words.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; When you tell a demon power to go, it
[1:01:09] must go.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Jesus said, "Whatever you
[1:01:13] bind must be bound."
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Whatever you loose must be loose.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; So say, "Come, I lose your demon power.
[1:01:19] I loose you. Come pick up this package
[1:01:20] and take it back." They must obey your
[1:01:22] words.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, let's awaken to this. Jesus
[1:01:28] said, "Whatever you loose shall be
[1:01:29] loosed."
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Whatever you bind shall be bound.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't say only here on the earth. He
[1:01:35] said whatever you bind on earth will be
[1:01:36] bound in heaven.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; You see how powerful you are.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Deity is living in you.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; But we don't operate. We don't exercise
[1:01:43] it.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; So he says now you don't have to you
[1:01:46] don't have to now call a divine healer
[1:01:48] to come heal you. The healing divine
[1:01:50] healing HAS ALREADY BEEN PURCHASED AT
[1:01:52] CALVARY. YES. AMEN.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; NOW, let me tell you, there are seven
[1:01:55] compound names of Jehovah.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; How many of you know the seven compound
[1:02:00] names?
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Then I tell you, every everything you
[1:02:03] have need of for this life's journey can
[1:02:05] be tied up to one of those names.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; If you need salvation, he's savior.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; If you need healing, he's rafa.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; If you need righteousness, he's our
[1:02:12] righteousness. He's our peace. He's
[1:02:14] shalom.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; You can find it there.
[1:02:19] Gyra
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; is provision under Gyra.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Come on up people. I want you to work
[1:02:24] with me.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Is provision everything you have need of
[1:02:27] for this earthly journey. Is it tied up
[1:02:29] under Gyra?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; So is that part of redemptive rights?
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Is that part of redemptive blessings?
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; So is it wrong to ask for it?
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; It's not wrong. Put up 1 Chronicles here
[1:02:38] chapter 4. Amen. Brother Josh, come. You
[1:02:40] got to walk quick today. Amen. I don't
[1:02:41] want to take them too long. Let's walk
[1:02:42] quickly here today. 1 Chronicles chapter
[1:02:45] 4. Let's read verse 9. Be a man of
[1:02:47] vision. Have vision. The if a certain
[1:02:49] allotment has been given to you, be like
[1:02:51] Jabz. Say, I'm not satisfied with this.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; I have high ambition.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Jabus was more honorable than his
[1:02:56] brothers. His mother said, I'm going to
[1:02:58] call you sorrowful. You, I see only
[1:03:00] sorry in your life because you are what
[1:03:01] you are named. Right? You know the
[1:03:03] mothers cried out their name in birth.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; But now this man had better vision. He
[1:03:08] called on the God of Israel. He didn't
[1:03:09] call for Joshua and all the elders to
[1:03:11] say, "You marked out this territory. I
[1:03:13] want more land." No. He called on the
[1:03:15] God of Israel. OH THAT THOU WOULDEST
[1:03:17] BLESSED ME indeed
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; and enlarge MY COAST.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; YOU GAVE ME A SMALL PIECE OF LAND HERE.
[1:03:24] I HAVE WALKED EVERY INCH OF GROUND AND
[1:03:26] MY DREAM IS TOO BIG FOR WHAT YOU HAVE
[1:03:28] GIVEN ME.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Enlarge my territory
[1:03:35] that thine HAND MIGHT BE WITH me
[1:03:38] and that thou wouldest keep me from
[1:03:40] evil.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; And that it may NOT GRIEVE ME. WHATEVER
[1:03:42] YOU'RE GOING TO BLESS ME WITH, HOWEVER
[1:03:44] YOU'RE GOING TO ENLARGE ME,
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to grieve me. I don't
[1:03:51] want this thing to hinder my faith.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; And God granted him. So if this prayer
[1:03:56] was an illegal prayer, God would never
[1:03:59] have granted him. I want you to know
[1:04:00] that praying like this is legal in the
[1:04:02] kingdom of God.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; It's a legal transaction.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; And God gr Somebody read the last verse
[1:04:09] with me. And God granted him that which
[1:04:12] he requested. I'm asking you, what are
[1:04:14] you requesting from the Lord?
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:24] So what we are learning everything he
[1:04:27] says it's within us. We've got to know
[1:04:29] how to reach out and drink.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you need to change
[1:04:33] that cable, maybe do that. Amen. Here's
[1:04:36] a cable out here. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:39] Hallelujah.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "All we do is drink from the
[1:04:46] fountain of life." Where's the fountain
[1:04:48] of life? Somebody say, "The Holy Ghost."
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; We got to drink. Where's the Holy Ghost?
[1:04:52] Somebody say, "Within me."
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Within me.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; So, I'm drinking and pushing out
[1:04:57] everything we have need of this journey.
[1:05:01] In this journey. Somebody say, "In this
[1:05:03] journey."
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; In this journey.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about heaven.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; He's saying IN THIS JOURNEY. YES.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Maybe I'm not preaching to all of
[1:05:11] you, but I'm preaching to somebody this
[1:05:13] morning.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm preaching to somebody because
[1:05:15] somebody has needs in this journey.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. All things we have need of is in
[1:05:24] him and we are planted in him and we
[1:05:26] draw from him. He's the inexhaustible
[1:05:28] fountain of life. I can't exhaust him.
[1:05:30] Right? Let's follow now and go on. is.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; So like Jabz, WE MUST HAVE A BIGGER
[1:05:37] IMAGINATION.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; WE MUST HAVE A BIGGER VISION.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; WHERE THERE'S NO VISION, PEOPLE PERISH.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; SO HE'S SAYING WE MUST DRINK MORE THAN
[1:05:46] OUR PORTION.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; DON'T TAKE LITTLE BIT HOLY GHOST.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; We need to take MORE HOLY GHOST BECAUSE
[1:05:54] HE'S SAYING AS WE DRAW OUT, IT'S
[1:05:55] INEXHAUSTIBLE.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. drink more than it portion. AND
[1:06:02] MORE IT DRINKS, THE BIGGER IT SWELLS UP.
[1:06:04] YOU SEE PRESSURE WHAT IT DOES?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Because you're drinking now from this
[1:06:08] water. It's pushing up. Pushing up.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; It's pushing out.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's saying PUSHING OUT
[1:06:14] THE LIMBS, PUSHING OUT LEAVES.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; PUSHING OUT BLOSSOMS. PUSHING OUT. AMEN.
[1:06:20] IT PUSHES OUT THE APPLES. AMEN. And
[1:06:22] that's the way the Christian is.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; You see what this Christian is like?
[1:06:26] He's pushing it out of him. The
[1:06:28] potential IS LAYING WITHIN HIM. HE'S
[1:06:30] PUSHING IT OUT.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Do you know God
[1:06:35] wants you to be effective in his
[1:06:36] kingdom?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; God has designed you specifically with
[1:06:39] different temperaments and different
[1:06:40] character and different vision. Amen. To
[1:06:42] be used in the kingdom of God.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; We are not here to suppress your vision.
[1:06:46] We are here. Amen. Amen. To allow you to
[1:06:49] express THE VISION OF GOD THAT GOD HAS
[1:06:51] PLACED WITHIN YOU.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says, "We are
[1:06:56] planted together in Christ Jesus who is
[1:06:59] inexhaustible fountain of life. We are
[1:07:01] planted in Christ. We just drink, drink,
[1:07:04] and push out." Drink, drink, and push
[1:07:06] out.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're saying, "What is
[1:07:10] this?" Drink, drink, push out. I'm
[1:07:11] hearing the word. I'm eating the word.
[1:07:13] I'm hearing about my healing. I'm
[1:07:14] pushing out my healing.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Here
[1:07:21] again he says and everything we have
[1:07:24] need for the earthly journey.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Somebody say earthly journey.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Earthly journey.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Divine healing. The power of God and all
[1:07:33] these other things is in every
[1:07:35] individual in here that's received the
[1:07:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost for you're
[1:07:38] planted in Christ.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Let me let me go back and tell you that
[1:07:42] all the redemptive blessings are in the
[1:07:44] redemptive names and all are in you now.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. So if you need Rafa, where is it?
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; You got to drink and
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; to drink means you need to know the word
[1:07:55] of God.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; So go start to know the scriptures about
[1:07:58] healing.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; I sent my word and I healed your
[1:08:01] diseases. Isaiah 53:5. Amen. 1 Peter
[1:08:04] 2:24. Amen. Mark 16.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; All the scriptures that's now attached
[1:08:11] to healing. The prophet says if you want
[1:08:13] healing, he says, "Think on healing
[1:08:15] scriptures." Think on healing.
[1:08:19] If you want gyra, you need to go that my
[1:08:21] God shall provide all my needs needs. My
[1:08:24] God shall supply all my needs according
[1:08:26] to his riches in glory.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you know if he is going
[1:08:30] to supply my need according to his
[1:08:33] riches?
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; It's not coming small.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Hear what the Apostle Paul is saying. MY
[1:08:41] GOD SHALL SUPPLY ALL MY needs
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; according to his riches in glory.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; So which MEANS IF YOU'RE ASKING GOD FOR
[1:08:49] 10 GRAND, GOD DON'T HAVE 10 grand in
[1:08:51] glory.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Even his streets are paved in gold.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; So when he says bro, you know how you
[1:08:57] tell a person, hey, I only got this one
[1:08:59] grand change. God is going to tell you,
[1:09:00] I only got one gold brick here. That's
[1:09:02] my smallest change. Come on now.
[1:09:03] Somebody believe what I'm saying.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; According to his riches in glory.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many of you know
[1:09:13] you get what you ask for?
[1:09:16] you get what you ask for. That's
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; So, if you're going to keep saying,
[1:09:19] "Lord, help me pay my rent. Help me pay
[1:09:21] my rent." God is going to keep helping
[1:09:22] you pay your rent.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Because that's what you're asking.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; I need better amen than that.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me pay my rent.
[1:09:34] You need to expand your vision. Be like
[1:09:35] Jabz.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you for the provision thus
[1:09:38] far that you help me to pay the rent. I
[1:09:40] see myself now as a proud homeowner.
[1:09:42] Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And I thank you Lord that you've already
[1:09:47] provided for my need
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Lord because every time give the Lord a
[1:09:52] reason why
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; because me renting here
[1:09:55] every time the people want to sell the
[1:09:57] flat I must move.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Come on be practical.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Did he say everything you have need of
[1:10:03] your earthly journey?
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be heavenly good and
[1:10:05] earthly no good to you.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Every time I settle in have my first
[1:10:09] child. They're telling me I must move. a
[1:10:11] six-month baby. I must take and move
[1:10:12] with the furniture and the cot and this
[1:10:14] and that.
[1:10:17] David, you're going to learn.
[1:10:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:24] You have your second baby. They're
[1:10:25] telling you, "Hey, you know what? I'm
[1:10:26] giving you a notice. You have to move.
[1:10:32] Tell the Lord, I'm tired of moving."
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; I'm only suggesting to you a vision,
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; but maybe you got big bigger vision than
[1:10:40] me. Maybe you have bigger expectations
[1:10:41] than me.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; What is it that you have? It's laying
[1:10:44] within you.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Now, let's recap. Did the prophet say
[1:10:48] everything you have need of is in you?
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; You got to drink and push it out. Which
[1:10:52] means you've got to attach the promise
[1:10:53] of God, the word of God to your life and
[1:10:55] push it out of you. Speak it out of you.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; How many of you when I prophesied over
[1:11:02] you and I told you that Abraham was
[1:11:04] going to be the father of many nations
[1:11:05] and I said, "You'll be the owner of many
[1:11:07] businesses."
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Why? You need to drink and push out.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; You can't keep praying, Lord, help me
[1:11:16] with this land. Help me with this land.
[1:11:17] That's what he's going to give you. He's
[1:11:19] the high priest of our confession.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; John Ryan began to confess. Beside John
[1:11:23] Ryan, there's another man, the prophet
[1:11:24] says. He had the jerks. You'll pick this
[1:11:27] up. So, this man kept jerking. He came
[1:11:30] in the prayer line. The prophet says,
[1:11:31] "You're healed." He couldn't understand
[1:11:32] what the prophet is saying. He kept
[1:11:34] jerking. Amen. The prophet says, "You
[1:11:36] already healed according to the word of
[1:11:38] God." So this man, he began to go and he
[1:11:40] began to confess and tell everyone that
[1:11:42] he was healed. His mother was a
[1:11:44] Christian. Amen. He went back home in
[1:11:45] the countryside and he began to tell his
[1:11:47] mother he was healed. He began to go to
[1:11:49] church and tell everyone he was healed.
[1:11:51] The prophet says one day he's sitting
[1:11:52] there in the in the lounge and the
[1:11:54] mother and the pastor is saying, "Are
[1:11:56] you sure that this man didn't work you
[1:11:57] up?"
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. He said he began
[1:12:01] to have the jerks. Amen. The mother even
[1:12:03] told the son, "Son, you're embarrassing
[1:12:05] us now. You keep making this confession
[1:12:07] that you are healed, but everywhere we
[1:12:09] go, you don't act like you are healed.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; You don't look like you are healed. You
[1:12:14] keep got the jerks.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But this man for 6 months, he kept
[1:12:18] his confession to pick this up in the
[1:12:19] message is jerking. Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; And he began to say, "Amen. The man of
[1:12:26] God told me I was healed and I believe I
[1:12:29] am healed."
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And immediately he was delivered
[1:12:32] and set free.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:35] Immediately he was delivered and set
[1:12:38] free.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we everything we have need of
[1:12:44] for this earthly journey.
[1:12:46] Got to drink more than your portion.
[1:12:48] Amen. Now hear what he says. It has to
[1:12:50] drink more than his portion. Did we go
[1:12:53] past it? Right. Divine healing things
[1:12:54] you have in need of he says everything
[1:12:57] you have need of for this life's
[1:12:58] journey. Even the rapture.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:05] Somebody read that even the
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; is
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; brother you don't have that on the
[1:13:13] screen there it's paragraph 85 on that
[1:13:16] uh
[1:13:19] he has to drink more than his portion
[1:13:21] that's where we are right
[1:13:27] is the inexhaustible
[1:13:30] that's the way the Christian is yes next
[1:13:36] Amen. So he says here
[1:13:40] divine healing power of God. We got that
[1:13:42] right. All of these things planted in
[1:13:44] Christ. The Holy Ghost baptism. Yeah.
[1:13:46] There it is. Now everything you have
[1:13:48] need of for this life's journey, even
[1:13:50] the rapture is right in you then.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to now make sense to what the
[1:13:56] prophet is saying.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because the apostle
[1:14:00] Paul says he shall descend with the
[1:14:02] voice, the shout, the voice, and the
[1:14:04] trump.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Come on now, somebody walk with me.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; In the rapture message,
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; we know our portion of the rapture is
[1:14:11] the
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; shout. What is the shout? It's a message
[1:14:14] going forth.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; What is that message going forth? It's
[1:14:17] the word of life, the living bread of
[1:14:18] life.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And what did he say? The word is in the
[1:14:21] bride.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; So is he saying our part of the rapture,
[1:14:24] the shout is in us.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; that sense made to what he's saying now.
[1:14:29] Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; The shout is in us.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; The rapture is right in you then.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Tell your neighbor,
[1:14:41] it's about to get good.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; It's about
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Tell not time to sleep now.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; It's about to get good.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; You see what's going on here? You didn't
[1:14:47] notice Sister Josephine is already here
[1:14:49] trying to take over from Joshua
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; because she has vision. Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; She knows when Joshua goes, she don't
[1:14:57] want to leave this pastor stranded.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; So she says, I'm already going to start
[1:15:03] training
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; to put quotes. She says, because why
[1:15:06] must Joshua get scolding a lot?
[1:15:09] [laughter]
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'll be easier on her
[1:15:13] because she's a girl. [laughter]
[1:15:16] Praise the Lord. So he says, even the
[1:15:19] rapture is in you. Then he goes, there's
[1:15:21] people resenting when he said that. HE
[1:15:23] SAYS DON'T RESENT THAT.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. THE RAPTURE IS IN US
[1:15:27] NOW. I WILL PROVE IT BY the gospel.
[1:15:30] Those who have justified, those who are
[1:15:32] justified, he had glorified. Then then
[1:15:34] in heaven today, we are glorified in the
[1:15:36] presence of God. Right now, I'm just
[1:15:38] pushing out to it. God in his word. You
[1:15:41] believe it? Amen. Praise the Lord. So,
[1:15:44] we are pushing out now every redemptive
[1:15:46] blessing that God has promised us. Amen.
[1:15:49] He says the pro. Now, here here's what
[1:15:51] we want to get to. Now, the trouble with
[1:15:53] people when you become a Christian, you
[1:15:55] don't look around in the Bible.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Help us. That's true.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't look in the Bible.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Do you know there are message people,
[1:16:04] children that grew up in the message
[1:16:05] that bypassed the cross?
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; You were taught to accept the prophet in
[1:16:12] the message.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; They made you bypass the cross. Yes.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; You can't bypass the cross
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; and come to Malachi 4.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; You've got to start at the cross.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Be born again.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; How many of you can testify to what I'm
[1:16:29] saying right now?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Many people have missed that experience.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; They bypassed the cross because they
[1:16:34] tried to make you force you to believe
[1:16:36] God sent a prophet.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's true.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; They didn't make you fall in love with
[1:16:40] Jesus first.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. All they told you was you
[1:16:43] can't do this, you can't do that, you
[1:16:44] can't do this, you can't do that.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; They didn't show you how Jesus came to
[1:16:49] save you from a life of sin. That you
[1:16:50] were born in sin and you were marked for
[1:16:52] death 70 years and they'll put you in a
[1:16:54] coffin and forget about you.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; But Jesus came to give you purpose.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus came to give you eternal life.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; See, SO THE PE PROBLEM with people, you
[1:17:06] become a Christian, YOU DON'T LOOK
[1:17:07] AROUND IN THE BIBLE.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; YES. That is absolutely true.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. You say, "Well, I accepted Jesus as
[1:17:12] my personal savior." He says, "That's
[1:17:14] good."
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with that. That's
[1:17:17] what you should do. But after you become
[1:17:19] a Christian, go in the Bible.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Look around and see what's yours.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Now, prayer means to petition.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; YOU PETITION HEAVEN
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; YOUR WORD SAID THIS,
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; and I'm coming to petition HEAVEN THAT
[1:17:36] YOU HAVE GOT TO ANSWER ACCORDING TO THE
[1:17:38] WORD.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And the [clears throat] prophet
[1:17:40] says heavens and earth, he says because
[1:17:42] heavens and earth will pass away. Heaven
[1:17:43] will respond to your prayer. He says my
[1:17:45] word will never fail.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; The high priest has GOT TO ANSWER YOUR
[1:17:49] PRAYER because you are petitioning
[1:17:51] heaven according to the word of God.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; You are praying according to the word of
[1:17:55] God.
[1:17:57] Amen. So the more we drink, we push out
[1:18:00] it brings out these elements. So pushing
[1:18:03] now also means it's going to push out
[1:18:05] bitterness.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. M.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; It's going to push out envy.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; It's going to push OUT BACKBITING.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO PUSH OUT GOSSIP.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; PRESSURE. THAT'S WHAT PRESSURE DOES.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I said this on Wednesday in my prayer.
[1:18:20] I'm going to say it now as preaching.
[1:18:21] PART OF PREACHING. SOME OF YOU ARE NOT
[1:18:23] receiving what you are receiving because
[1:18:25] there are blockages there.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; You hate everyone.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; You speak about everyone.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; You gossip about everyone.
[1:18:37] You're envious of everyone.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; You're jealous of everyone. You have
[1:18:41] unforgiveness in your heart.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; That is what's stopping now.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Go and read after Mark 11:23 after 24
[1:18:51] and see what 25 says. Go read even when
[1:18:54] Jesus is teaching the disciples how to
[1:18:56] pray. He says, "Forgive."
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to be each other's
[1:19:04] gatekeeper.
[1:19:07] Be your husband's gatekeeper. Be your
[1:19:08] wife's gatekeeper. Be your children's
[1:19:11] gatekeeper. Then next time they start to
[1:19:13] speak like that, say, "Brother, please
[1:19:14] stop."
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; We mustn't speak like this.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; We mustn't get angry like this. Let's
[1:19:21] help one another. Let's be utterly good.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Say, "Love, I hear what you're saying,
[1:19:28] but you know, according to the word of
[1:19:29] God, we should not be speaking like
[1:19:31] that. Let's forgive them. Let's rather
[1:19:32] pray for them."
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; You know, some people are so uh
[1:19:39] defensive all the time.
[1:19:42] They got the guard up all the time.
[1:19:45] Amen. They've been scared through life.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; And now they respond from that hurt.
[1:19:50] They respond from that pain. They
[1:19:51] respond from that situation.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Obviously, there's nobody here.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; We don't know what we're talking about,
[1:20:00] right? But just imagine there was a
[1:20:01] person like this.
[1:20:04] Hallelujah.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; If you imagine there was a person like
[1:20:08] this
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; I told you we're in practical classes.
[1:20:11] I'm sorry I'm not preaching some fancy
[1:20:12] revelation to you. This is a revelation
[1:20:14] in itself.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; To make you operate and work this way.
[1:20:17] Amen. You're going to see things change
[1:20:19] in your life.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Because all the years of teaching we're
[1:20:24] going to apply practically now. We are
[1:20:26] THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE ON the earth
[1:20:27] right now.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. [applause and cheering]
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we need to push out bitterness
[1:20:35] and then God begin to spread in you.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Then you become a son of God and you can
[1:20:41] stand the pressure that the Holy Ghost
[1:20:43] wants to push out.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Hey, the Holy Ghost is pushing out now.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is pushing out my
[1:20:50] unforgiveness. The Holy Ghost is pushing
[1:20:51] out my bitterness.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, I love you and I
[1:20:55] forgive you. Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Never mind what you done to me. It's
[1:21:00] okay. That's right.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; If the Lord forgave ME, I CAN FORGIVE
[1:21:03] YOU.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I WAS THE VILEST OF SINS, BUT THE LORD
[1:21:06] FORGAVE ME. I FORGIVE YOU. Never mind.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; You know what? Keep that money.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Nobody caught that.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; It's all right.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Because every time you now see that
[1:21:18] brother, you tell
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; it's all right.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; God has blessed you.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even I can show you Bible now
[1:21:29] where the Bible says but when you give
[1:21:30] don't expect to receive it again.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; So give it away.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're in Christ, he says all
[1:21:45] these qualities of the Holy Spirit lives
[1:21:47] in you. What qualities? Faith, virtue.
[1:21:49] These are qualities of the Holy Spirit.
[1:21:51] Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[1:21:52] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness,
[1:21:54] charity. He says all of these things
[1:21:56] live in you. The trouble of it is who
[1:22:00] don't drink?
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; You.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; The devil don't care how much you come
[1:22:06] as long as you don't drink.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; You mean my one year of a church
[1:22:11] attendance this whole year meant nothing
[1:22:12] because I wasn't drinking.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; To drink means you take in the word of
[1:22:16] God and you apply it.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; You push out.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; So whole year people have been coming
[1:22:21] have not been applying. That's why they
[1:22:23] have not seeing results. Praise the
[1:22:25] Lord. The devil don't care how much you
[1:22:26] come.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The trouble of it is you don't
[1:22:30] drink. Praise the Lord. And the devil
[1:22:34] hasn't got any tie to it. He hasn't got
[1:22:36] any legal right. His legal rights were
[1:22:38] spoiled at Calvary.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; So here what he says now. So the
[1:22:45] fountain is open. I want to get to the
[1:22:46] part where he says you want to drink.
[1:22:49] Amen. Next. Go to the next slide. there.
[1:22:52] He says, "You want to drink till you
[1:22:53] spread out and let everybody else see
[1:22:55] it."
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Push out. Get a testimony.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to advance your thought and
[1:23:03] say, "Get a get a vision."
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Get a goal.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Push out.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Commit it to God.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Believe it.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Step out on it.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; CLAIM GOD'S PROMISE.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Tell everyone about your new car.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just trying to make it
[1:23:21] practical for you now.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; If you're sick, tell everybody you are
[1:23:25] healed.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Tell everybody
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; if you haven't received the Lord JESUS
[1:23:33] CHRIST, TELL EVERYBODY you are saved.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:38] [laughter]
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "GET A TESTIMONY." WHAT IS YOUR
[1:23:43] TESTIMONY?
[1:23:46] Maybe somebody needs peace here this
[1:23:47] morning. Tell everyone, "I have peace.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; I have shalom." Get a testimony.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Commit it to God. Believe it. Step out
[1:24:01] on it. Claim God's promise. Just commit
[1:24:03] it. Believe it. Commit thy ways unto the
[1:24:05] Lord. He will bring to pass whatever you
[1:24:07] want. But he can't do it until as long
[1:24:10] as you're holding it.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Where you holding it? Inside your
[1:24:13] thoughts.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; You know, some people have the most
[1:24:16] beautiful thoughts.
[1:24:19] And some people say a penny for your
[1:24:20] thoughts.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You staying in a one-bedroom
[1:24:24] shack.
[1:24:26] Maybe here in a maybe a tin town. You're
[1:24:29] staying in tin town. Do they still have
[1:24:32] tin town? I'm just using tin town so
[1:24:34] nobody gets offended here because tin
[1:24:37] town finished, right? You're staying in
[1:24:39] a one-bedroom tin town, but in your mind
[1:24:42] you have a beautiful picture of where
[1:24:44] you're staying.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; But if you know, if you don't leave the
[1:24:51] walls of that tin town,
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; nothing will happen.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; You've got to go out
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; and make it happen. Push it out. Make
[1:25:00] your vision come to pass.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; I'll give you a Bible.
[1:25:07] The Bible says Jesus, the lamb of God,
[1:25:10] was slain from before the foundation of
[1:25:11] the world.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Beautiful thought. Imagine if you just
[1:25:14] left it there.
[1:25:16] If he never physically came to the earth
[1:25:18] and did it, but all he had was a
[1:25:20] beautiful thought. The lamb is slain
[1:25:21] from before the foundation of the world.
[1:25:23] Come season and time, the word had to be
[1:25:25] made flesh.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; The word had to be crucified.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; So don't leave your dreams lying in your
[1:25:33] head till they put you 6 foot deep.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't go to the grave with hidden
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; vision, hidden dreams within you,
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; hidden potential within you.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; And don't only have earthly ambitions.
[1:25:48] Have an earthly ambition. Lord, I'm
[1:25:50] going to have a vision to bring souls to
[1:25:52] Christ.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; This year I must bring, put a number to
[1:25:55] it.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; I must bring five souls to the Lord
[1:25:58] Jesus Christ. It's your vision. Put it
[1:26:00] down.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know even the disciples
[1:26:03] says Lord give us boldness to speak in
[1:26:06] your name.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; So maybe you right now you can't speak
[1:26:09] to anyone. Pray and say LORD GIVE ME
[1:26:11] BOLDNESS to witness.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; I feel like nobody's listening to me. I
[1:26:17] don't know.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody's ready to run out.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:23] He says
[1:26:27] now I will see if I'm in now what? These
[1:26:29] are faith defeating words, prayer
[1:26:32] killing words.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; I'll see if I'm feeling better. I will
[1:26:36] see how it goes.
[1:26:42] And see if this will work.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; To see means you have vision.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the blind can't lead
[1:26:52] the blind.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; They'll both fall into a dish. I'm going
[1:26:55] to get to some points here. I want to
[1:26:56] get to now. Amen. Praise the Lord as we
[1:26:58] close. Amen. I'm sorry it's taking
[1:26:59] longer than it should, but I trust it's
[1:27:02] helping somebody.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. He
[1:27:06] says, "It's not what you see. It's what
[1:27:09] you believe."
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; It's what you believe.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; It's not what you feel. He never did
[1:27:15] say, "Did you feel it?" He said, "Did
[1:27:17] you believe it?"
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; That's how you're saved by faith. That's
[1:27:20] how you're healed by faith. And faith is
[1:27:22] a substance of things hoped for. The
[1:27:23] evidence of things you don't taste, see,
[1:27:26] taste, feel, smell, hear. You just
[1:27:27] believe it, act on it. Amen. So, you
[1:27:30] know, the prophet of God also tells us
[1:27:31] about the spring and he wants you to
[1:27:33] know how it is bubbling
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; and he went and spoke to the spring and
[1:27:36] he said if that spring could speak, it
[1:27:38] will tell me there's something within me
[1:27:39] pushing out.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; So, when they ask you how are you so
[1:27:43] successful in life?
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; How you making it in life? The economy
[1:27:47] is so bad. How you surviving?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; There's something within me that's
[1:27:50] pushing out.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Pushing out.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we've got TO
[1:27:56] ENLARGE OUR BORDERS AND OUR TERRITORIES
[1:27:57] and and and and our imagination and ask
[1:28:00] God for big things.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; He says, we know that the human mind
[1:28:04] asks for things that it it imagines. But
[1:28:07] we know that also out of the abundance
[1:28:08] of the heart, the mouth speaks.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; So, you can't lie.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, if there's a small
[1:28:15] dream and a small imagination, that's
[1:28:17] all you're going to ask.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Break the limit. Uh Amen. Break the
[1:28:21] limits on your mind this morning. and
[1:28:24] think things that are not meant for you.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet uh Elisha on his
[1:28:32] deathbed he spoke to this king shash and
[1:28:35] he said strike the ground with arrows to
[1:28:38] signify your future victories over the
[1:28:39] enemy
[1:28:41] and he only struck the ground three
[1:28:43] times. I am saying strike the ground
[1:28:45] more. Amen.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; The Elisha rebuked him
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; and he said, "YOU SHOULD HAVE STRUCK
[1:28:50] FIVE OR SIX TIMES
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; because that would mean AMEN. MORE
[1:28:53] VICTORIES FOR YOU."
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; So what is he telling him? Have a high
[1:28:57] ambition.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now. I want to help somebody
[1:29:06] here.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; I want to help somebody here.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; I want you to see what the prophet of
[1:29:10] God is saying because people have this
[1:29:11] defeated mindset in the message. I want
[1:29:13] you to hear what the prophet of God is
[1:29:15] saying and you take what the prophet of
[1:29:16] God is saying. Put up the next one.
[1:29:17] Amen. Praise the Lord. He says, "I like
[1:29:19] people I like to see poor people stay
[1:29:22] poor."
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Is that what he's saying?
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; I like to see poor people when they
[1:29:27] haven't got nothing and see them come up
[1:29:29] and get a little nice home and a
[1:29:32] automobile.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't know how good that makes
[1:29:41] me feel. Amen.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; You know what message people say? I know
[1:29:45] the prophet didn't have ours. I'm not
[1:29:47] the prophet.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Am I supposed to live my life like the
[1:29:55] prophet? He was called for his special
[1:29:57] ministry.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; This is too much for some people.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; wonderful.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Why are you not going hunting like the
[1:30:07] prophet then?
[1:30:10] You only want to do certain things like
[1:30:11] the prophet when the prophet went for
[1:30:13] days in solitude and pray.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet when he died, he had a
[1:30:21] Cadillac in the garage. He gave it to
[1:30:22] him. He said he didn't want to drive it.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; How you think Joseph Brandham and all
[1:30:29] these people are multi-millionaires?
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Because of the prophets. Come on. People
[1:30:34] are
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; don't show.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's true.
[1:30:40] How you think they build that voice of
[1:30:41] God building a thing? Those funds came
[1:30:43] by the ministry of the prophet. That was
[1:30:45] the effect of his ministry. He didn't
[1:30:47] want to do it for himself.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "I need to remain to the true
[1:30:52] cause of the word."
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; He needed to remain faithful.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Some people think, you know, Rebecca
[1:31:01] only live tried to live like Eliza. Now
[1:31:04] Elas was a servant. So that when she
[1:31:06] went to uh Isaac now and she was now the
[1:31:09] wife of Isaac, she wanted to live like
[1:31:11] Eliza like a servant.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; You think every time Isaac said Isaac
[1:31:20] said look at
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; north, south, west, it's all ours.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; She said, "No, I want to be like any."
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. Am I talking sense here?
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; She said, "I want to be like Isa." My
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; that's wonderful. Amen.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I wish I had this in my notes.
[1:31:40] Please record this in because on my next
[1:31:42] sermon somewhere else, I can make notes
[1:31:43] of these things. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; So, what is the prophet's standard?
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; What is the prophet's basic? He wants to
[1:31:54] see poor people progress
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; and get a nice little home and a
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; So he says here in the next one, when
[1:32:06] they crossed over, they got to the other
[1:32:08] side. Now you've asked, ask what you
[1:32:10] will and I will give it to you. Perfect
[1:32:11] type of the church.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Now he says Elisha asked for a double
[1:32:17] portion of the spirit. DON'T BE SCARED
[1:32:19] TO ASK.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:22] Ask abundantly.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes your rich uncle come
[1:32:28] and he take you to the shop and he tell
[1:32:30] you to buy something. [crying]
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; All your life you be buying knicknacks.
[1:32:34] Now you you tempted to go only for the
[1:32:35] knickknacks
[1:32:38] because that's your limitation
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; and you tell them no I don't want to be
[1:32:41] too extravagant.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; We know Pringles laying over there.
[1:32:48] Pringles is expensive chips right? You
[1:32:50] don't want to go for the Pringles. You
[1:32:52] want to go now for ghost pops.
[1:32:55] You say, "No, no, I like spookies.
[1:32:59] It's cheap now." That uncle thinking,
[1:33:02] "Hey, what limited?" I told him, "Come
[1:33:04] here and choose what you want."
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Take one chocolate. You're going for
[1:33:09] chomp.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; You must go for Ro.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Lind.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; He told you take.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; If he told you take, HE MUST PAY.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES. Lucky I got an uncle.
[1:33:21] [laughter]
[1:33:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:28] If he told you take, who must pay?
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; He must pay.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; He told you take.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Did Jesus say ask?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Go read John 14:15 and 16. It's all tied
[1:33:41] to ask. Ask. Ask. Go read Matthew 7:7.
[1:33:46] Ask. Amen.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; So ask big things. Ask abundantly. You
[1:33:54] have not because you ASK NOT. YOU ASK
[1:33:56] NOT. WHY? [crying]
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Because you don't believe.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; ASK A WHOLE LOT. GOD WILL GIVE YOU A
[1:34:03] WHOLE LOT.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; HAVE A LOT OF FAITH.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; A fellow told me the old day he was
[1:34:09] riding an old model T4.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Said one day he happened to get some
[1:34:16] good faith and God gave him a Buick.
[1:34:18] What did he happen to have?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Good faith.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Good faith.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Good faith.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Good faith for it.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "I got Buick faith. I am
[1:34:30] praying for Cadillac faith."
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; WHICH MEANS THE MAN'S VISION WAS SO
[1:34:33] GOOD.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; HE wasn't going to settle.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; All right. That's good. That's right.
[1:34:40] Keep on WHAT YOU BELIEVE. HOLD ON TO IT.
[1:34:42] GOD WOULD GIVE IT. HE'S GOT FOUR FAITH.
[1:34:44] So stay with the fourth death. Let's get
[1:34:46] a little more faith. Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody will keep getting stuck and
[1:34:52] broken down. Somebody ought to be saying
[1:34:53] amen for that.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; I want you to know
[1:34:59] if I say this now, you're going to think
[1:35:00] I'm being materialistic. You didn't get
[1:35:02] married to your car to say until death
[1:35:04] do us part.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; The the other one sitting next to you on
[1:35:12] your left there when you're driving,
[1:35:13] that is until death do your part.

[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; for living beneath their privileges.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; And saying, you know what? I am the
[1:37:39] royal seed of Abraham.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Could read there in Genesis chapter 12
[1:37:43] when God called Abraham.
[1:37:46] God didn't play with Abraham.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Put up Genesis 12 there.
[1:37:54] Now, if somebody called you with this
[1:37:56] kind of bait, I'd run
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; for it.
[1:38:01] [snorts]
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; This man was serving idols in the land
[1:38:04] of

[1:38:08] was didn't have a good name.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; And God makes him an offer like this.
[1:38:13] People think that Abraham moved out of
[1:38:15] the land by faith thinking he had no
[1:38:17] promises.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; God makes him the promise first.
[1:38:21] [snorts] Now you tell me who wouldn't
[1:38:22] respond like Abraham with this kind of
[1:38:24] reward.

[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; And he followed.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; So be specific. Tell him what you want.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; You're saying BE SPECIFIC? YES. GOD WAS
[1:39:53] VERY SPECIFIC when he told Noah to build
[1:39:55] the ark.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't leave it to Noah's
[1:39:58] imagination.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Noah would have probably built one small
[1:40:01] boat.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; He says, "No, this is my imagination. I
[1:40:05] want you to build a ark so big. I'll
[1:40:08] give you the dimensions
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; how to build it and what kind of width
[1:40:11] specifics
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; because I needed to cater for all the
[1:40:14] animals two by two
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; some I'm coming in five you know there
[1:40:18] wasn't only two right you go read the
[1:40:19] Bible carefully you'll see some came
[1:40:21] more
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; and I also needed to cater for human
[1:40:25] beings
[1:40:28] do you know God wasn't limited there he
[1:40:30] had enough room that if other people
[1:40:31] wanted to come
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; they could come
[1:40:36] Hello.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; God wouldn't have made preparation and
[1:40:39] then preached for 40 years. Hey, come,
[1:40:41] come, come. It's going to rain.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; He had seating available for them.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish somebody believed me.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; He had seating available for them. They
[1:40:49] refused to come.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; See, like the church, we got seating
[1:40:53] available for people. They refused to
[1:40:55] come this morning.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:41:01] Satan held them bound.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God is very
[1:41:07] specific. He told Noah how to build what
[1:41:10] was in his mind.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; God was specific when he gave Moses
[1:41:17] dimensions to build the tabernacle.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; He told him what material to use. HE
[1:41:22] TOLD HIM HOW TO overlay it with gold.
[1:41:24] [clears throat]
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; He told him how to build the ark
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; of the covenant.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. OUR GOD IS VERY SPECIFIC.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And our God has a God-sized
[1:41:36] thoughts,
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Godsiz imagination, Godsiz vision.

[1:41:44] look at the moon, look at the galaxies,
[1:41:47] LOOK AT THE EARTH, LOOK AT ALL the
[1:41:49] things that God created and the diverse
[1:41:52] uh uniqueness of and the variety of
[1:41:54] things. MY GOD IS UNLIMITED VISION.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; MY GOD IS UNLIMITED IMAGINATION.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; WE WERE CREATED TO BE LIKE GOD. THEN WHY
[1:42:03] IS OUR VISION LIMITED?
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; You know why? We've allowed the the the
[1:42:08] the family that we grew up to shape OUR
[1:42:10] MINDS.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; NOW ALLOW THE WORD OF GOD TO RESHAPE
[1:42:13] YOUR MIND THAT THERE'S UNLIMITED
[1:42:15] POTENTIAL WITHIN YOU.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Don't let fear and
[1:42:24] unbelief what God has given us.
[1:42:26] Amen. A man was made to be God, to be
[1:42:28] God. Amen. He's in the image of God. SO,

[1:42:32] GOD. LET'S HAVE A VISION LIKE GOD.

[1:42:46] ABOVE ALL THAT WE CAN ASK OR THINK.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; According to the power that workketh in
[1:42:50] us. So we know that every word is a seed
[1:42:53] and a seed has to be planted. Amen. In
[1:42:55] the inexhaustible fountain of life which
[1:42:57] is Christ. A believer has to drink

[1:43:44] ASK BIG THINGS." GOD WANTS YOU TO ask
[1:43:46] big things. He don't want you to be
[1:43:48] little, petty, and juvenile.

[1:43:52] prophet. He wants you to ask big THINGS

[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; it's God's will.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:44:56] Praise the Lord. You know, I preach and
[1:44:59] teach. In fact, a lot of you should be
[1:45:01] sitting with notebooks
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; because unless you got very good memory,
[1:45:05] you're going to remember everything I
[1:45:06] said and how to apply it. And with the
[1:45:09] so little views we have on our YouTube,
[1:45:11] you're definitely not going back to our
[1:45:12] channel to listen to it.
[1:45:14] Praise the Lord. So, maybe get a
[1:45:16] notebook and the important part that you
[1:45:18] can apply to your life, write it down.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:24] Don't
[1:45:26] Oh yeah. Where am I? He says, "Now a
[1:45:29] fish, you think a fish can out in the
[1:45:30] ocean?" No. You think a little rat in
[1:45:33] Egypt would have eaten all Joseph's
[1:45:35] grain? No. He says we afraid. We think
[1:45:38] how many times Amen. You can never
[1:45:40] exhaust God's powers, his mercies to his
[1:45:42] children. Amen. You cannot exhaust his
[1:45:45] goodness. Some people I hate to call on
[1:45:47] God so much. That's what he wants you to
[1:45:50] do.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; You have not because you ask not.
[1:45:53] That's what God wants you to ask big
[1:45:55] things. See what the prophet is saying
[1:45:57] now. I asked for hundred of souls in
[1:46:00] this meeting.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; You know what message people say? No,
[1:46:04] we're not looking for numbers.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've been around
[1:46:10] message people.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; You preaching the gospel for nothing.
[1:46:16] Then
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; imagine somebody going fishing and they
[1:46:19] say, "I'm not respecting fish. I just
[1:46:20] came here to waste my time.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:46:24] [clears throat]
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; you went fishing. You're not expecting
[1:46:27] fish.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; They go there now and they set up the
[1:46:32] thing. We haven't come here to change
[1:46:34] you from your religion.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; You've been there in this outreaches
[1:46:37] with us. You've been there in these
[1:46:39] outriches with us. Greetings in the name
[1:46:41] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We
[1:46:44] are HERE TO PRESENT THE LORD JESUS
[1:46:45] CHRIST TO YOU, BUT WE HAVEN'T COME TO
[1:46:46] CHANGE YOU FROM YOUR RELIGION. WE
[1:46:48] HAVEN'T come to change you from what you
[1:46:50] came to do there. turn that thing off
[1:46:52] and go home.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Because what you are PRESENTING MUST BE
[1:46:58] BETTER THAN WHAT THEY HAVE for them to
[1:47:00] want what you have.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; I'm asking for hundreds of souls in this
[1:47:07] meeting.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; What else you asking for? I'M ASKING
[1:47:11] THAT EVERY SICK person enters that door
[1:47:14] will go out of here. Well, I'm believing
[1:47:16] it.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, we got the opening of the
[1:47:19] word. We don't pray for the sick. I'll
[1:47:20] tell you, I was sitting with somebody
[1:47:21] last week, Saturday, and they're telling
[1:47:23] me, "Bru, you know, I don't believe in
[1:47:24] just laying hands and praying for the
[1:47:26] sick."
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; God help us. Amen.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Message pastor.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; I I you know, we got past that now.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know where he is going past
[1:47:38] because he's so old. He is going to need
[1:47:40] healing of the body one of these days.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. enters the door, every sick person
[1:47:50] that enters the door will go out well.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:47:55] amen.
[1:47:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; I'm believing it. I'm believing that
[1:48:01] after we go, there won't be another
[1:48:03] gathering of people, but it'll be a
[1:48:05] revival. Satan has kept me out of it for
[1:48:07] long enough, and I believe the hour is
[1:48:09] here for a real sweeping revival in
[1:48:11] every church and around the country.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; What are we believing for?
[1:48:17] Don't be afraid to go to ask God for
[1:48:19] anything he's willing more than willing
[1:48:21] to give it there then you are to receive
[1:48:24] it.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; See if we can get that little shadow
[1:48:28] wiped away to know that he's willing to
[1:48:31] do it. You're his children. He loves
[1:48:33] you.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; You know how you like to minister and do
[1:48:35] good things for your children. The very
[1:48:37] strain of fatherhood. Parent of your
[1:48:39] children comes from God. Amen. He's the
[1:48:43] father of us all. He loves us. He wants
[1:48:45] to do it for us. If he can just get us
[1:48:47] lined up with the blessings and so
[1:48:49] forth. You see some people were
[1:48:50] misaligned with the blessings. What is
[1:48:52] he saying? Father wants to get us
[1:48:54] aligned with the blessings.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:59] Some of you wives ought to be nudging
[1:49:01] your husband and saying, "Come on.
[1:49:05] You the cause of this thing here. Come
[1:49:07] on now."
[1:49:09] Hello.
[1:49:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:18] We'll do marriage counseling afterwards.
[1:49:23] Everybody, when you leave here, if
[1:49:24] you're healed, act like you're healed.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Act like you're healed.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; You can't raise YOUR HAND. ACT LIKE YOU
[1:49:32] CAN raise your hand.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Act like you're healed. If you believe
[1:49:39] it, act like you are. Go saying, "THANK
[1:49:41] YOU, LORD. IT'S A FINISHED WORK." There
[1:49:43] sister J performed it this morning.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; She wasn't prepared. She said she
[1:49:47] started to walk around. I was quite
[1:49:48] surprised. She sent me a message at
[1:49:49] first 6 this morning telling me she
[1:49:51] wants to give a testimony.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; So by which means she was already up by
[1:49:58] that time. She was walking around. Thank
[1:50:00] you Lord. It's a finished work. It's
[1:50:02] done.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:07] [snorts]
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:12] It's not by feelings. It's by faith. Say
[1:50:14] you're healed. Believe you're healed.
[1:50:16] Act like you're healed. Associate with
[1:50:18] those who believe in healing.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will bring you right out
[1:50:23] to perfect soundness of health will not
[1:50:25] fail.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; So let's take that concept and apply to
[1:50:29] other areas of our life. If I'm sick, I
[1:50:31] must associate with those that believe
[1:50:33] in healing.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Hey, I can apply this principle now. You
[1:50:36] mean if I want to be a successful
[1:50:38] businessman, I CAN ASSOCIATE WITH
[1:50:40] SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; HEY, come on now, SOMEBODY.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; LAWS AND PRINCIPLE MUST WORK EVERY TIME
[1:50:45] IT IS APPLIED.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; IF I TAKE SOMETHING AND THROW IT UP NOW
[1:50:47] IN THE AIR HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA, it must
[1:50:49] come down because it's a principle. If I
[1:50:51] go to the USA and I throw it up, it must
[1:50:53] come down. LAWS AND PRINCIPLE MUST WORK.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; So if I ASSOCIATE WITH A SUCCESSFUL
[1:51:00] BUSINESSMAN and ask him,
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; How can I want to be a successful
[1:51:06] businessman and I go by the brokeest
[1:51:08] business? That fell a puzzling.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Who are you setting before you?
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Jab, if you want to be a good
[1:51:22] lawyer, will you go study the life of
[1:51:24] one lawyer who's losing every case?
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:51:33] If you want to be I MUST ASSOCIATE WITH
[1:51:35] THE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN. If I want to
[1:51:38] become successful in whatever we are
[1:51:40] doing associate with those who are
[1:51:42] successful.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Birds of a feather flock together.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; You say
[1:51:51] this is now for the Pharisees. Give me a
[1:51:54] quote.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Now you better you believe you're
[1:51:57] better. Say you're better. Act like
[1:51:59] you're better. Yes sir. I'm saved. You
[1:52:01] assoc say it with those that are saved.
[1:52:02] Ah, see now salvation even
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; he says even salvation you associate
[1:52:09] with those that are saved.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; When you first were lost, you came to
[1:52:13] church, you were associating with those
[1:52:14] that are saved.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Then you started to act like you're
[1:52:17] saved.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; You started to speak like you are saved.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; You started to say hallelujah. Amen.
[1:52:21] Praise the Lord. You started to speak
[1:52:23] the language like you are saved.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Believe that you are saved. Act like
[1:52:26] you're saved. And it was righteousness.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm so glad about today?
[1:52:32] I'm giving you a lot of quotes.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; You can't say I'm preaching my own
[1:52:35] thoughts here.
[1:52:38] [clears throat]
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; He was wounded for a transgression,
[1:52:45] sitting at the right of hand of the
[1:52:47] father to make anything you confess.
[1:52:49] Now, what if you come to the altar and
[1:52:50] say, "Well, I don't know."
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; But in your heart, you believe that
[1:52:54] you're saved and don't say nothing about
[1:52:55] it. You will never be saved
[1:53:01] until you believe it, accept it, and
[1:53:02] confess it. So I'm going to say, "Show
[1:53:04] me the company you are keeping, and I'll
[1:53:06] show you who you are." You know the
[1:53:07] prophet says that, right?
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Show me what you're looking at. You are
[1:53:10] becoming whatever image you're placing
[1:53:12] before you. Whatever you're thinking
[1:53:13] about, you are the sum of your thoughts.
[1:53:15] If you think negative, you'll be
[1:53:16] negative. If you think lack, you'll be
[1:53:18] in lack. People need to have a vision
[1:53:20] for their lives. Don't associate with
[1:53:22] people without vision.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Hello. Come on. This is the climax now.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; I want YOU TO CUT OFF ALL association
[1:53:30] with people that are not adding value to
[1:53:32] your life.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; In fact, to associate with them, it's
[1:53:42] illegal in the kingdom.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "How can light have
[1:53:45] fellowship with darkness?"
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; I know some of you are going to think,
[1:53:49] "Hey, everything is illegal with you.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Change your friends. Change your
[1:54:05] associates.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Some of you have been friends with
[1:54:09] people for years that have never spoken
[1:54:12] for your betterment.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; They have gone on and progressed, but
[1:54:17] you are the same. And they never help
[1:54:19] you,
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; never encourage you, never inspire you.
[1:54:23] Hello. Change your friends.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Change your friends. Change your
[1:54:32] associates.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; You can't be a Christian and still have
[1:54:37] holy friends.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; They have their beers. You say, "No,
[1:54:41] I'll have coke."
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; You compromise on who you are and your
[1:54:47] principles because you want to watch two
[1:54:49] people kick one ball. You go sit in the
[1:54:51] bar.
[1:54:53] No,
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; because you're a message believer. You
[1:54:56] don't have TV in the house.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; But you're still violating now. You say,
[1:55:00] "I don't have TV in the house. I must
[1:55:01] sit in the bar now." That people
[1:55:02] smoking. They're drinking there, but
[1:55:04] you're drinking coke.
[1:55:06] [snorts] You gone on to their territory.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's an illegal act.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; It's an illegal act.
[1:55:19] You stepped onto their grounds, but not
[1:55:20] once did they step onto your grounds.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Not once did you bring them to church.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; They didn't want to come onto your
[1:55:27] territory, but you went onto their
[1:55:28] territory.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to remind you, Jesus said,
[1:55:31] you are the light of the world.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; He says, and light, Amen. light in the
[1:55:36] world. You can't afford to dim your
[1:55:37] light and associate with darkness. Jesus
[1:55:39] also said, you are the salt of the
[1:55:41] earth.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, people are flavorless.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; They need some salt. You are the
[1:55:47] seasoning they need. SO DON'T COMPROMISE
[1:55:49] WHO YOU ARE. They need to Amen. They
[1:55:51] need to see that you're a true Christian
[1:55:53] and they need to make you need to make
[1:55:55] them hunger and thirst for what you
[1:55:56] have. Let's read this quote. Samson got
[1:55:59] into bad company. And always remember
[1:56:02] when you are in bad company, you're out
[1:56:04] of the will of the Lord.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Why you want to frustrate yourself?
[1:56:12] Because Liverpool lost the other day.
[1:56:16] Now you're fighting with all your
[1:56:17] friends because all your man united
[1:56:18] friends are phoning you and saying ah
[1:56:19] you're lost.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; You're having fruitless mindless uh
[1:56:24] conversations.
[1:56:26] Those people there living it up rich and
[1:56:28] everything.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; And you're having fights here.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Power of influence.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; That fellow missed the goal that you
[1:56:37] getting angry in the house.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; You don't want to talk to anyone now
[1:56:43] because they're all making fun of you.
[1:56:46] You being in the room.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:55] [laughter]
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; See, you are out of the will of the
[1:57:01] Lord. If you lay with a dog, you get its
[1:57:04] fleas. That's right.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; That's a rather rude expression. It's
[1:57:07] got a lot of common everyday sense to
[1:57:09] it. You can't associate yourself with
[1:57:12] things of the world and expect to stay
[1:57:14] spiritual and humble before the Lord.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; You are known by your company. Show me
[1:57:22] your company. I'll tell you who you are.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; And when the church begins to keep
[1:57:26] company with the world, it's no more
[1:57:28] then it's no more than the world. It
[1:57:30] gets out of fellowship with the Holy
[1:57:31] Spirit. Gets out of company with God and
[1:57:34] angels and God's heritage when you begin
[1:57:36] to flirt as Samson did. Amen. How's he
[1:57:40] going to do it? We're closing on this
[1:57:41] quote now. He says he's going to give
[1:57:43] you things little by little. The promise
[1:57:46] is yours. The land is yours. I've given
[1:57:48] it to you. Go and possess it. I'm going
[1:57:50] to not going to give it to you all in
[1:57:51] one year. I'll give it to you. Amen. He
[1:57:54] says, "If I give it to you in one year,
[1:57:56] the wild beasts are going to come and
[1:57:57] multiply against you. But as you push
[1:58:00] out, as you are able to take the land,
[1:58:02] Jabz, as you are able to walk every inch
[1:58:04] of ground,
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to enlarge your territory.
[1:58:07] I'll give you just as you are able to
[1:58:09] take the lamb. What a beautiful tonight
[1:58:11] for divine healing. The promise is
[1:58:12] yours. By the stripes you are healed.
[1:58:14] Now you have to go in and take it. Maybe
[1:58:16] you can't take it all at one time. But
[1:58:18] you can just accept it tonight. Only
[1:58:20] thing you have to do is push out the
[1:58:21] Amorites. Push out the days of miracles
[1:58:24] is pass. See this pastor telling me you
[1:58:26] can't pray for the sick.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; He's telling me the days of miracles is
[1:58:29] passed and other things. Just go in and
[1:58:31] take the lamp. Push away those
[1:58:32] theologies and all the explaining away.
[1:58:35] The promise is mine. Just take it. It's
[1:58:38] yours. What a beautiful promise.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Taking time. [applause] Amen. But I want
[1:58:45] you to do these things.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; We are the most powerful army of God
[1:58:54] right now.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; We are the super church. We are the
[1:58:58] super race.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the royal seed of Abraham.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Yes.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Come musicians, let's sing and worship
[1:59:07] the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; What a glorious promise we have.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Who
[1:59:15] here is going to change their
[1:59:16] confession?
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Who here is going to have a better
[1:59:19] vision?
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Who here is going to think better
[1:59:21] thoughts?
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Think higher thoughts. Have a vision for
[1:59:25] your life. Have a concern for your
[1:59:27] salvation.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Have a concern for your healing. Get
[1:59:30] those things right. Jesus said, "Seek
[1:59:32] the kingdom first." Remember how we
[1:59:34] started the fountain is the Holy Ghost
[1:59:37] and out of the Holy Ghost you can push
[1:59:38] out everything you have need of in this
[1:59:40] life's journey.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; So if you have the Holy Ghost which
[1:59:43] means you are now have [music] untapped
[1:59:45] resources and we are saying let's change
[1:59:47] that and tap into resources. Let's sing
[1:59:49] from F. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm no longer
[1:59:53] [music] a slave to fear. This is
[1:59:55] [singing] what's been crippling people.
[1:59:56] Fear. Fear to ask God for big [music]
[1:59:57] things. Change it now.
[2:00:01] You unravel me
[2:00:04] [music] with [singing] a melody.
[2:00:08] You surround me [music] with a song
[2:00:12] [singing]
[2:00:16] of [music] deliverance
[2:00:19] from my enemies. [singing]
[2:00:24] To love my [music and singing] fears
[2:00:27] are gone. I'm no longer I'm no
[2:00:31] [music and singing] longer
[2:00:33] slave
[2:00:34] to fear. I am a child of God. [music]
[2:00:39] I am [singing] a child
[2:00:42] of God. [music]
[2:00:43] I'm no longer [singing] I'm no longer a
[2:00:47] slave
[2:00:49] to fear. [music]
[2:00:50] I am a child of God.
[2:00:53] I am child
[2:00:56] of God. [music] Sing from eternity.
[2:00:59] From eternity
[2:01:03] you have chosen me. [music and singing]
[2:01:07] Love has for my name. I've been born
[2:01:12] [music and singing] again. I've been
[2:01:14] born again
