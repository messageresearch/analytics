[Music] oh yes Lord father we thank you Lord that you are here in the midst we invite you to you Lord and we know father you promised we're two or more gathered together in your name you're are

approaching Lord we realize there's not much time left oh god father help us to keep our lamb trimed and burning Lord and run with everything that's within us oh God lord we come now father subjecting ourselves under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and we ask you to have your Divine will and purpose this evening we commit ourselves into your precious and mighty hand in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ much Thanksgiving amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Amen the name that is above every other name amen amen let's turn to Zechariah Chapter 14 Amen on Sunday we were speaking about the manifested light in Mark 11:23 amen and we found that there's only a certain class of people that can light up that scripture amen so I couldn't preach everything on Sunday and the spirit had it work that way for a reason I couldn't get to the depth of the message because we had amen some visitors here and I didn't want want to go too deep into the message and lose them amen so we'll progress amen this evening can we close the door amen it could be uh can get the petrol smell amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen so let's turn to Zechariah Chapter 14 amen we were speaking on manifesting the light of Mark 11:23 to make it live amen so remember there can be Darkness upon scriptures like Darkness upon Malachi 4: 5 and6 Darkness on Revelation 10:7 Darkness on Luke 17:30 but then somebody had to Shine the Light amen so we are saying brother brandham opened up scripture of Mark 11:23 but it's not a oneman scripture because the scripture says whosoever amen amen hallelujah I was telling you a few weeks ago I was talking to a pastor and he was telling me there's not a local Pastor now he's from Johannesburg and he was telling me that only brother brandham could speak amen so you see how people can still shut down scriptural prophecies by allotting it to one man amen so let's read from verse 6 chapter 14: 6 Zechariah and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark amen so this is a different kind of day but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light amen yes amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord thank Lord and we know the prophet came at evening time yes amen amen hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord you may be seated amen amen so we learned here that to the prophet's message it tells you the messenger always came at the End of the Age amen when the church had gone into apostasy there comes the messenger at the end of the age to bring light to that age am amen so if we can I'm just going to lay a few scriptures here just to show you amen that it's in the a pattern in the Bible in Genesis chapter 1 and verse amen three and God said let there be light and there was light amen and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness amen so we know that light and darkness cannot mix yes amen that's why the Bible also the Apostle Paul is admonishing us be not unequally yolked with unbelievers amen hallelujah there's got to be a separation and the word brings a separation amen amen if we do not compromise with the word the unbelief will separate because we are the light and darkness must separate amen amen that's according to scripture now if we go to John before we get to John let's turn to Isaiah 60 amen praise the Lord amen Brothers I'm going to fall down here with a petrol smell amen Isaiah chapter 60 now we know that this scripture as well I tell you this message of the hour is so packed am because in Shalom you'll take this scripture now and what is Shalom it is the rising of the sun Shalom amen because shalom means good morning amen amen so it's a dawning of a new day darkness to the lateran church age but light to the believer amen arise Shine for thy light is come amen notice there present tense and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen hallelujah when we look at the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ we are seeing the glory of the Lord amen amen because the faith that we have is not our own faith but the faith of the Son of God it's no longer I that liveth but it's Christ that liveth in me amen for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee amen amen hallelujah and the Gentiles shall come to thy light have we come to the light amen and the Kings to the brightness of thy Rising amen hallelujah amen let's turn to John amen The Book of John praise the Lord John chapter 1 now there's no two Beginnings right so John starts out here in the beginning the same in the beginning as Genesis 1 so it's the same beginning amen amen hallelujah so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God amen amen so when we look at the literal Sun what is that it's the word of God made manifest right the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and here's where we're going to get to in him was life amen amen and the life was the light of men you see light coming out of him again amen hallelujah and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not now this is a different kind of Darkness every time the light shined the light was the darkness was aware of it and it had to flee amen amen but look at the age we are living in light has been manifested but the darkness can't comprehended why demon possessed amen possession all hell has been Unleashed upon the Earth you you would know that brother Brandon prophesies and he says I I predict a time where the entire age will be in Insanity we are living in it amen you step out your house you can see people are in Insanity amen hallelujah now there was a man s from God whose name was John we know we have had a second flrunner now we know his name the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lighted every man that cometh to the world Hallelujah so everyone in this age who is going to experience light is going to experience it through the second Forerunner yes amen amen yes now God has a provided way and he won't change his plan or his program for anybody else amen nobody can come to the light of these scriptures by bypassing the Forerunner of the age because he alone was sent to reveal the mysteries of God he alone was sent to turn our heart back to the faith of the fathers amen and we stand here today and we present the truth that that scripture has already happened that our hearts have already been turned back to the faith of the fathers amen that the mystery of God is already revealed amen and we are a part of the mystery of God yes amen hallelujah we are right here at the time where Jesus amen is coming back to take his people to the next Dimension amen so we are in the process of the Rapture that started with a shout and God is now revealing himself through a many membered body amen hallelujah in the first coming we had the groom coming it was Jesus Christ coming it was Adam restored back in his fullness amen so at the second coming he must restore Eve to her fullness so you're going to see this time period from now until we get translated where Eve is coming to a full Glory she's coming back to a hieden beauty amen can somebody identify with that God is taking away all unbelief from our hearts amen the unbelief amen that surrounded the church age has been taken away amen because God has taken away all fear amen and the only thing that's being established now in the heart of the believer is fa we coming back to a faith civilization amen where we speak amen and then the word creates itself Hallelujah now you know that Faith work at patience amen you learn that in the life of Abraham amen you don't get Faith by patience yes yes but Faith work patience so if today you pray for something and it doesn't happen are you going to let go of the promise of God or are you going to hold true to the word that came out of your [Music] mouth because the prophet says that God when God said let there be light he says we don't know how long it took but that word had to come to pass because God believed his own word so it depends whether we're looking to the eyes of of the flesh or we're looking to the Unseen eye amen amen because the Unseen eye says that it's already done it's already finished I'm just waiting for that word to come into manifestation and that's what patience is all about amen Faith work at patience so we can't grow weary in our faith amen sometimes we go on believing a week two weeks 3 weeks four weeks and we're looking at the symptom we're looking at all of these symptoms maybe it's sickness financial difficulty whatever it is your problem it is you're looking at the symptom and if you're not in patience thank you waiting for the promise Lord you are going to lose out amen because impatience brings fear fear that it won't work fear that my word is not powerful enough fear amen that this thing won't come to pass amen and that's how people get defeated but we've got to hold true to our confession amen there's only one law on the earth for the believer and that law was taken away from man if you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart and Jesus is coming back to establish that law in the hearts of men but it seems it it we got to keep teaching it week after week because man can't believe his own word man can't believe that he is so powerful that even the angel of the Lord came down to amen forget Gideon and he told him thou Mighty Man of Valor he looks around you talking to me because prior to that gon is not known as a mighty man of Val amen but it had to come time and season am amen it's all about time and season and I ask you when it comes about your time and season not to miss it amen you got to step into that season amen time and season came for that man who was at the pool but he missed his time and season amen so he didn't get his healing amen time and season came for Moses but then he slew the Egyptian out of time and season yet he was the deliverer he had to wait 40 years waiting in patience am but then something happened he met the supernatural but we've seen the supernatural in this year yes Lord God himself has come our way amen can we testify is there any doubt amen hallelujah when we met the pill of fire when we see the supernatural we realize there's an unseen Force an unseen Army that accompanies the children of God amen hallelujah thank thank we really need to study Hebrews go read Hebrews how the angels are ministers to the HS of Salvation the angels are waiting at command but people go unawares amen because they can't see we are so taught to un accustomed to what we see amen hallelujah but the eyes of faith will say let the angel of God go forth oh yes I can't make it in time amen your prayer can go to somebody that's in USA that may be in need dying amen but you can commission amen hallelujah and pray that the angel of God go and meet them there and touch them and deliver them amen but you even that scripture you've got to believe that you possess the power if you read the book of Hebrews he's showing you that man was not amen that this Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah he was made higher than the angels that every Angel is is at his command and I the reason I'm telling you that is because God has taken you and he said come and be seated with me in Heavenly places amen hallelujah you can't be seated with Christ in Heavenly places you can't be joints with him and not be able to control principalities and Powers amen yes L amen praise the Lord amen oh isn't he good amen so we need a man who can turn on the light in any situation amen hallelujah and we know that man amen we're coming to close if there's anybody who knows the man who can turn on the light it's the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ because there's nobody knows the husband better than the wife yes amen amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen we're coming to our scriptures here and we were reading amen hallelujah in St John chapter 6: 68 now we know the word is light the word is light that brings light to any situation amen I want to encourage you to always use the word of God in any situation because the word is light am if somebody you're speaking to God is presenting opportunities to us every day people are telling us stuff every day and we can't be silent with the truth because the word is light the word can deliver people from their situations we've got to stand up sit on a hill we've got to stand up salt of the earth and we've got to speak the word of God God amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord amen John 668 says then Simon Peter answered him and said Lord to whom shall we go thou as the words of eternal life amen amen listen to what he's saying you have the words of eternal life you mean words give us eternal life amen so the because why the SP spoken word is the Original Seed so the way back the prophet is saying the way back to eternal life is going to come back by the spoken word am and Jesus was here on Earth speaking the word and he had the words to lead us to eternal life amen everything we know about eternal life and everything we know that's leading us back to our true inheritance is coming by the word of God Amen here in John 14:6 our lordes Jesus is telling us I am the way amen amen hallelujah I am the truth amen and I am the life no man come unto the father but by me amen amen amen so Jesus is saying I am the way and if you this is what brother Bram is saying now and if you're in Christ you become a new creation when you're born into the kingdom of God you become a part of Christ and the way you get in the way by a new birth we know the other scripture by one Spirit we are all baptized into the body of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah right now you'll see around the world the lord is Shifting The People's focus and and really bringing out the revelation of the Holy Ghost to them amen because that's one of the Mysteries that has to be revealed in the last days amen people are confused about the Holy Ghost is he a third person in the Trinity what is his really function what is his job what is he supposed to do amen hallelujah he's the truth nobody else has the truth so in him you cannot have truth till you have Jesus then you're in the truth amen we read there in John 1:4 where it says in him was life and the life was the light of men amen so Jesus is saying I am the way what is the way seven steps amen amen seven steps is the way isn't that what he's done since he left taking us to seven steps seven Church ages amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen now gram says the third thing Jesus we have to come in to him and he he alone is the life that light gives us light that that life gives us light Jesus is the only light there is he says you could be russalite camlite whatever you might be it's a false light until you get in Jesus you're not in the light the only way to God no man cometh to the father except by me so you cannot go to God you can't go to heaven you got to get in the way and Jesus is the way he is the only truth there is and he is the only light the only true light the only true manifested light is Jesus Christ we have woman light Methodist light we have Baptist light we have Pentecostal light we have all kinds of light but Jesus is the True Light amen amen amen amen thank you you know our lord Jesus goes on to tell us that we are the children of the day and the children of the world walk in darkness they walk in night time they love Darkness amen amen and here in John 3: 19 this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil amen what a what a condition that is amen so can you see the value that God had in you that he he chose you because look at the ladies in church AG wretched miserable naked blind and they don't know it amen now we would be none the better right but God elected us he chose us from before the foundation of the world Amen and he predestinated us unto adoption of sons yes unto adoption of children amen hallelujah thank you if we walking the prophet says if you're walking in the light at night time you're walking under your artificial light there's only one true daylight that's sunlight and there's only one true Christian Light and that is the light of the sun of God is the only true light he says sometimes you know you get insane people he says you tell them they refuse to walk in sunlight and they say oh the sun is not shining and run into his basement he refuses the help of the sun he says that's just his own stupidity the sun is shining somebody come to the window and all come out John the sun is shining he says I refuse to believe such nonsense now he misses the warmth of the sun he misses the lifegiving Rays that it gives he miss this is the beauty that it shows and the life that it brings forth am amen why am I telling you that look at our people have missed the revelation of the word amen the opening of The Seven Seals the Revelation that came with the opening of The Seven Seals All The Mysteries of God were revealed what is that light coming to the believer amen why why are we so fasc why are we so impressed with the word that was open you say impressed yes brother Bram says I wonder why we are not sufficiently impressed with the word that is in our midst he says we are not sufficiently impressed yes why am I telling you that he says before Seven Seals were revealed before the great mysterious light show showed for showed forth in the heavens up there in tuon he sent me back and at the same time was at hand for the Seven Seals which held the seven Mysteries of the entire Bible was sealed with these Seven Seals so what is the seals coming to do give us a word faith come by the hearing of the word but this word didn't come from the earth this came by a mighty Angel amen so it's a word from Heaven to equip a people from the earth for rapturing Faith amen amen that's right amen you see if we lose the value of the opening of the word we are not going to get the faith for a Rapture for a body change amen we can't go into a and take a body change with a denominational message right amen amen hallelujah we've got to establish that that we can't take a Rapture with a denominational message and a denominational approach yes amen amen amen praise the Lord he says how those angels down along the road messengers of the church ages opened a certain part of that but in the seventh hour the seventh messenger that all these Mysteries should be finished the seventh Earthly messenger see this angel that he speaks of then was on earth right and he saw another angel coming down not the Earthly angel that had been given the message here but a mighty angel came from heaven with a rainbow over him and set his foot on land and sea and swore by him that lives forever and ever time shall be no more more but before he broke forth those Seven Seals to reveal them he showed the miraculous he showed it first in the heavens amen amen amen he says they took pictures all across Southern United States Mexico it hangs now in life magazines still a mystery to them you see how it's still Darkness to them but he declares it in the heavens before he does it on the earth he always does that he shows his eyes his signs in the heavens first amen so here the prophet is telling us now that when he was preaching the seven Church ages and he was draw amen he says I finished drawing on the Blackboard the seven Church ages and how the light there was a Halo a pillar of fire this Pillar of Fire how the light came in and how the light went out it says it's Among Us anyhow we know and the strange thing the last day when the last Church age was draw out this great Pillar of Fire came down among hundreds of people and took itself back to the back wall of the Tabernacle and there before hundreds draw those Church ages darkening and lightning just exactly I drew it on the board what a sight that must have been amen amen yes Lord can you imagine handwriting on the wall now drawing you amen the eyes of Faith now I want to say brother Bram is talking this before his congregation M yes probably few hundred people sitting there you're telling me not one of them would have called him out he's saying before these hundreds draw it out there on the wall amen mysteriously then he goes to show us a certain sign right he's telling us how the moon represents the sun we are the in the absence of the son the church represents him right but he said something strange happened amen because the pope went to Jerusalem and he says what happened the moon blacked out amen so all of this amen is for a time and a season it's coming there to show us what time we're living in amen amen so he says isn't it isn't it strange just before the pope took his journey to Jerusalem that the moon in the heavens made a total blackout just a few days before he took it his journey he's coming here also you see there's never been known what does it show is doing this to win Fellowship as he met on the day after he came into Jerusalem right he met the great Orthodox now if we come back he's saying he's going to unite the Protestant Catholics and everyone right if we come back to last year it's all done amen everything is done you won't find now they're going back to to signing any more treaties the final document to unite all world religions was signed in September last year right you'll see that on YouTube and wherever they're all sitting and they signed the final now it's implementation yes yes amen now they are going to put it out so what is he showing you he's listen to what he says the Moon is the church represents the church and before the shadow of the world crosses the moon and the shadow of worldism the shadow of worldliness worldly church has swept across to black out the entire light of the Bible the world got in the light of the reflection do you understand the world crossed in the light of the Moon and blinded out the sun and the reflection of the Moon that's supposed to be giving light to the Earth it was blacked out and it come in and draw the picture just exactly it did by inspiration amen Darkness this latest in church age yes amen Jesus standing outside the door knocking trying to get in darkness gross Darkness upon the people amen the hour is upon us Darkness gross Darkness see how many times he's saying this gross Darkness on the people now that's what it is what does all this mean where where are we standing what hour are we in how close are we to the coming well you say well they all had a Revival he says fear not little flock God is begin to separate the light from the darkness amen it's a dawning of a new day the church ages are fading out the church ages amen God is pressing the darkness into a place it has to do it Fade Out Church organizations Fade Out the world the world is covering the thing over and worldism has took the whole thing worldly acting worldly living it's the world you say ah you preaching a hard message you sounding like one of those old preachers we need the truth of the message am amen we can't be saying we believe the message of the hour believe the message of the hour and partaking the things of the world Amen God has come to reveal the mysteries of God to equip us and put us back in our original position amen people get excited amen just to achieve material things in this life they don't know what power lays in the Sun and Daughter of God am amen would you rather work Blood Sweat and Tears is just to buy a house and buy a car what does the Bible says what does a profit a man yes gains the whole world and lose his soul but let me put it in perspective for you this person could work all their life to achieve that buy it and spend the next 20 30 years paying it off right but he's doing it by his own strength so he may not after he does that he may never ever be a millionaire he may never ever be a billionaire amen but if that person comes into the kingdom of God and becomes a faith millionaire yes a faith billionaire amen then he's equipped to do any of these other things right amen because he can call for those things amen amen so what would you rather work till you 70 freeing off a house a car or do you want to become a faith millionaire amen a faith billionaire yes amen if we're doing it in monetary value is that that's what we achieving that's what we are amen uh striving for to become a faith generator amen how are we doing it by getting stuck into the word of God because Faith cometh by the hearing of the word amen amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord I'll close with this thought or maybe a parable sorry not a parable an an actual happening in the Bible in John 11 amen praise the Lord amen we know what John 11 is John is John 11 is where our Lord is opening up immortality life amen amen Jesus is coming and he's telling them he is the resurrection and the life you know to to the to the people out there Jesus was looking like an ordinary man amen we got to switch to this generator before this power goes off amen John 11 John 11 you know that Lazarus is sick amen hallelujah now the scripture is also tying in Prophecy Bible prophecy of future events to come amen because it's it's not in the first age second age third age but it's in the fourth stage of the restoration that he's coming back to resurrect the sleeping Saints is everybody following that amen the bride tree was eaten by four stages yes and God is restoring the bride tree back by four stages [Music] amen amen praise the Lord we find here The Story of Lazarus Mary Martha three Believers three end time message Believers amen hallelujah and they were close friends with Jesus amen the Bible tells you that he Lov them he loved his family we find here that in verse four when Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick he said the sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus so when he had heard that they were sick he aboe two days in the same place where he was okay then after that he said unto his disciples let us go into Judea again and his disciples said unto him Master the Jews of late sought to Stone thee and thou goest thou th again and Jesus said are there not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there's no light in him these things said he and after that he said unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep then said the disciples Lord if he be asleep he do well Al be Jesus spoke of his death but they thought that he spoke of taking of rest in sleep then Jesus said unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him so we know amen death struck Lazarus death is dark and it's gloomy Martha and Mary are Weeping mourning because of their brother they seem to be no hope amen other than to wait for the resurrection of the Dead you find there in the conversation they believe in the resurrection of the Dead amen they didn't realize that Jesus was carrying Light Within him amen that he is the light of the world Amen that the same God who spoke in the beginning let there be light the same God who said let us make man in our own image the same God Amen that was there in the Shak Glory of that uh Ark of the Covenant where they put Moses Rod amen and that Rod birthed into life the same God was standing in their midst you see they had partial Revelation but God was going to give them a complete revelation of who he was amen and God would take the situation to unlock that he is the way the truth and the life amen so if we are buried in Jesus there's no way we're going to die there's no way that we are going to be amen forgotten but we are going to come into eternal life amen amen hallelujah what was Jesus coming I'm showing you the approach of Jesus coming to a dark dismal situation because there's nothing as dark as death amen but here's the Manifest light coming forth amen 3 days passed and the fourth day is the dawning of a new day amen amen praise the Lord amen 20 then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house amen hallelujah then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again amen thank you Lord thy brother shall rise again the the sleeping Saints must rise yes amen amen amen whose Ministry is Mark 11:23 the bride amen is Mark 11:23 the bride Ministry whose Ministry is John 11:23 amen amen amen yes L John 11:23 thy brother shall rise again amen at the voice of the archangel amen hallelujah amen those that are dead in Christ amen will Jesus bring with him praise the Lord Mara said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day you see still eyes are closed yes Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection amen and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this they didn't realize that here was tabernacling a God in a body of time but the God himself did wasn't contained to time they were talking about a future tense but he's saying I don't exist I may be here in this body of Flesh that's governed by time but I am not control by time amen yes amen amen oh yes Hallelujah if I want to ra him up now I will raise him up see she said unto him yeah Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God who should come into the world and when she so said she went away and called Mary a sister secretly saying the master is come and call it for thee now notice that is a hidden Mystery because it's not documented that Jesus told her go call Mary th must prophesy again amen as soon as she heard she Rose quickly and came unto him now Jesus was not yet come into the town but was in the place where Martha met him the Jews that were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw Mary that she rose up hly and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there then when Mary was come to where Jesus was she saw him and fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he graned in his spirit and was troubled amen hallelujah and said where have you laid him and they said unto him Lord come and see Jesus wept then said the Jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died Jesus therefore again groaning in himself come to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it and Jesus said take he away the stone amen Mara the sister of him that was dead say unto him Lord by this time he stink it for he had been dead 4 days so I was trying to tell you that Jesus didn't come in the first restoration second restoration third restoration but he came at the fourth stage of the restoration amen amen if you don't know what that is the first stage was justification the second stage was sanctification the third stage was baptism of the Holy Ghost what is the fourth stage coming back into the formed word image coming back amen those three stages are changing you into the formed word image putting you back in your sunship Authority that is why Jesus is showing you he comes on the fourth day oh thank you Jesus amen he's coming on the fourth day which is a type of the fourth stage of the restoration when Adam is restored amen but now he's coming back in this time at this fourth stage of the restoration to to show you that Eve is fully restored to a position amen whether you like it or not the bride will be put on display amen yes yes amen if the bride was put on display in Genesis she must be put in display now you say what book are we in now we're in the Book of Revelation amen the Eve in re in Genesis was put on display and the Eve in Revelation must must be put on display amen we are the final voice to the final age Amen in that Alpha Age The Glorious age of Eden Eve was the final voice now we come to the Omega age we in Revelation 10 Mighty Angel seventh angel after seventh angel is John now I many if you believe that this is John in the Bible or is he typing a bride amen is John typing a bride John take the book eat the book th must prophesy again amen so we you can see in the progression of that scripture even we are the final voice amen because after that comes Revelation 11 which is two prophets Amen to Israel so we are the final voice before this thing goes off amen hallelujah so he says 4 days he laid there 4 days the church lay 4 days amen now if he it's all 16 cylinders so must we amen if he came with this authority to say amen and do this amen so can the bride amen [Music] hallelujah you see the Bride As thus sayth the Lord or she keep still watch what Jesus does now they took away the stone right this is verse 41 and Jesus lifted up his eyes and watch what his conversation is father I thank thee that thou has hurt me now many of us go to God oh Lord please hear
