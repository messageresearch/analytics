[25:50] the body is very important.
[25:53] You know back in my country there came a
[25:56] doctrine
[25:57] uh maybe you also may know it. uh what
[26:01] uh they're preaching is body is nothing.
[26:06] They're saying whatever we do in this
[26:09] body it is not countable.
[26:12] So they promote that doctrine and they
[26:15] they lived in a unclean life. Yeah.
[26:20] They lived in an unclean life. Yeah. You
[26:24] know because uh they're saying uh
[26:26] they're quoting uh you know Samaritan
[26:30] Samaritan woman. Yeah. Uh she was
[26:32] nothing but his predestinated seed. So
[26:35] only God dealt with her spirit with her
[26:39] soul not with body. So whatever we do
[26:43] that doesn't matter we can do. Such kind
[26:45] of doctrine that came to India. Yeah.
[26:49] One of the brother came to me and he
[26:52] started his discussion with me. Brother
[26:55] is nothing. I said why God made this
[26:59] body?
[27:01] The Bible says your body is the temple
[27:04] of God.
[27:06] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[27:09] Glory. Amen. My body should be clean
[27:12] before God. Amen. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[27:15] Hallelujah. Yes, we know in the epistle
[27:20] uh first Thessalonians I think so your
[27:23] body, your spirit and your soul must be
[27:27] blameless before his coming.
[27:30] Amen. So the body is very important.
[27:36] So our body is a holy temple of God. We
[27:41] must live a holy life. Yes.
[27:45] Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[27:48] not only that, from this body, God is
[27:52] going to bring a new body. Amen.
[27:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[27:58] Hallelujah. Glory. So this body we
[28:02] should not say this is nothing. This is
[28:03] not this is only mortal body. This is
[28:05] only temporary body. Oh, this is not. We
[28:08] should not say this. In fact, we have to

[35:54] bacteria? It's a small microorganism.
[35:59] It has a different shapes and different

[37:43] When when we are inoculated by that
[37:46] bacteria, we will overcome every kind of
[37:49] sin. Hallelujah.
[37:52] You know there was a man in the Bible
[37:54] whose name is Joseph.
[37:56] He overcome the sin. Why? Because he was
[38:00] inoculated by the bacteria.
[38:03] He was inoculated by the power of God.
[38:06] So when the sin comes against him, you
[38:10] know the sin cannot stand before him
[38:13] because already he was filled with the
[38:15] good bacteria.
[38:17] Hallelujah. Amen. He knows that his body
[38:20] has a purpose. Amen. Yes. God's purpose.

[38:58] him. It gives him the immunity to
[39:00] overcome every kind of struggle, every

[39:05] temptation. You know, see when brothers,
[39:08] you know, they hated him, okay? They
[39:11] wanted to kill him. But you know what
[39:14] happened at the end of the story? He
[39:17] told his brothers, "I will not kill you.
[39:21] Rather, I will feed you."
[39:23] What made him to speak like that? It's
[39:26] because of good bacteria. Amen.
[39:29] Hallelujah. He was filled with God's

[40:00] for love and Jacob typing for
[40:04] conviction, the Holy Spirit. And when we

[40:10] perfection. We cannot find any sin in
[40:13] him, any fault in him because he
[40:17] represent Jesus Christ. He was the old
[40:20] testament Jesus Christ. Isn't it?
[40:23] Hallelujah. Amen. So he was inoculated
[40:26] by the power of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[40:29] He was, you know, his immunity power
[40:32] came from the word. Amen. Amen.
[40:36] Hallelujah.
[40:38] Okay. A good bacteria. If you have a
[40:40] good
[40:42] bacteria, automatically your immunity
[40:44] power will be very strong. Yes. That
[40:47] means in the church if a believer got a
[40:51] real anointing of the Holy Spirit, in
[40:54] the church if a believer got the imunity
[40:57] power of the word of God, he will be a

[45:05] I want to bring it to you. Uh the
[45:08] identified masterpiece of God uh
[45:12] 6412
[45:13] uh
[45:15] 05 par number 42. Whatever you eat, you
[45:20] can only live physically because
[45:23] something died that you could live. Now
[45:27] whatever you do, even drink milk the
[45:31] bacteria whatever you have to live by
[45:34] the dead substances. It only goes to
[45:38] prove if we have to live this natural
[45:41] life can only do it by dead
[45:44] substances. Something had to die so we
[45:48] could live eternally. That Jesus Christ
[45:50] God gave for us as a ransom. Amen.
[45:54] Hallelujah. So one more scripture, one
[45:57] more quote I want to bring it to you. uh
[46:00] enticing spirits. That is
[46:03] 557 24 par number 145. And today men and
[46:09] women don't pay no attention to what the
[46:12] world has got for you. What entreatment
[46:16] it's got, what kind of
[46:19] bacteria inoculation they have and claim
[46:23] if you join the church you'll be all
[46:26] right. That's a false inoculation.
[46:29] You still got the disease of sin. That's
[46:32] right. But I tell you one thing,
[46:36] brother, that will inoculate you from
[46:38] sin. That's come to the previous blood
[46:41] of Jesus Christ. Amen. And filled with
[46:44] the Holy Ghost. Amen. That's inoculate
[46:47] you from all sin. Your desires will be
[46:50] heaven bound. Your desires will be
[46:53] heaven bound.
[46:55] When you are inoculated,
[46:57] your desires will be heaven bound.
[47:01] Brother said, we are not earthbound
[47:05] people. We are heaven bound people.
[47:09] Hallelujah. When we are inociated by the
[47:11] word of God, our desires will be heaven
[47:15] bound. We don't think carnal things. We
[47:18] will think spiritual things. And we
[47:21] believe and we will say we are not
[47:24] living in this world now. We are living
[47:26] another world. Amen.
[47:29] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. So if a believer
[47:33] really comes to an understanding that he
[47:36] is inoculated by the word of God, he
[47:39] will live a different life. He will
[47:42] think a different thinking. Is it right
[47:45] sir? Hallelujah. Amen. He want to mingle
[47:48] with the people, the worldly people.
[47:51] Okay, let me tell you one thing.
[47:53] Hallelujah. 19 uh
[47:57] 1997, that was the year I baptized.
[48:01] So when I was in Bible college, Bible
[48:04] school that is 1994 to
[48:08] 1997, I was in the Bible
[48:11] school. So I was fasting and praying and
[48:15] and you know uh my background came from
[48:18] Lutheran. So I went to the Pentecostal
[48:21] Bible college and there I received the
[48:24] Holy Spirit and began to speak in
[48:26] tongues and fasting and praying. So my
[48:30] spiritual life is going like that. One
[48:32] day what happened now? One day there
[48:35] came a message to me. A message book.
[48:39] That message book is why it why it why
[48:45] uh no no no why it has to be shepherds
[48:50] that's the message so that message book
[48:53] came to me I read that book it was total
[48:56] different what I learned from the Bible
[48:59] college
[49:01] I felt hey this is something newise
[49:05] hallelujah and another book came to me
[49:08] Yeah, we have seen his start and come to
[49:11] worship.
[49:13] So these two books when it came to me I
[49:17] was shock who is I know at the time I I
[49:20] did not even pronounce Bham. Yeah. I
[49:24] pronounce like this
[49:27] Bremham who is this
[49:29] Brahham who is this Brahma said it's a
[49:32] good preach might be. So I was thinking
[49:35] like that. One day a brother came to my
[49:38] Bible
[49:40] college. He brought some books to
[49:43] me. He introduced the prophet to me.
[49:47] He gave me a small track.
[49:50] The understanding of dating.
[49:53] Hallelujah. Glory. Amen.
[49:57] Amen. One Sunday after the uh my chapel
[50:01] is finished, the service is finished, I
[50:03] had my lunch and went to the staircase
[50:07] and I began to read because that brother
[50:10] told me God is not three, God is one.
[50:14] Hallelujah.
[50:15] Being as a theological student, I should
[50:17] not believe that. I should not agree
[50:19] with that. Yeah. Because back in Bible,
[50:22] they are God is three, God is three, God
[50:24] is three. But this brother said God is
[50:27] one not three. I was shocked. Hey why
[50:30] you are bringing see doctors to
[50:33] me. I told him no. He said no you go and
[50:37] pray and read that pamplet read this
[50:41] this booklet. So one day I went upstairs
[50:44] and I started reading. Before I read I
[50:47] prayed Lord this brother gave me this
[50:51] book. is saying that you are one but I
[50:53] believe you are
[50:55] three. Why this brother is giving this
[50:58] book I don't know but if it is so if it
[51:01] is true please open to me please reveal
[51:05] to me you know uh then I began to read
[51:10] at the end of that book I came to
[51:13] understand that God is not three God is
[51:16] one. Amen. God opened my eyes. Amen.
[51:20] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Something struck
[51:23] in my heart and I cried to the Lord.
[51:27] Yes, you are one. But that these people
[51:31] are cut into three pieces.
[51:34] Today h today I say Lord I believe that
[51:39] you are one. Amen. So there the
[51:42] revelation started that revelation began
[51:45] uh growing in me. Yeah. Amen. So one day
[51:49] you know they they gave me an assignment
[51:52] to all the students. Write about
[51:55] trinity. You go and write about trinity.
[51:58] How many essays how many pages you want?
[52:00] You can write. So that paper was given
[52:03] to me and I wrote there is no trinity in
[52:08] the
[52:09] Bible with big letters.
[52:14] Hallelujah. Amen. So I was called to the
[52:22] office what are you
[52:24] writing like that in my
[52:27] language being as a theological student
[52:29] why you writing I said sir what I write
[52:32] is true
[52:34] what I have written is true God is not
[52:38] three God is one
[52:41] he said where you got this doctrine
[52:46] I said this is not the doctrine. This is
[52:48] the truth of the Bible.
[52:52] Amen. He said,
[52:54] "Okay, did you read uh Brenham books?"
[53:01] Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:04] I said yes
[53:06] sir. There you have spider.
[53:11] Why did you read the books? I said that
[53:14] is the real message sir. A message from
[53:17] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:21] So from there
[53:24] something was taking place in my heart.
[53:30] The inoculation the good bacteria
[53:34] coming into me
[53:36] and making me strong. Amen. End of the
[53:39] Bible college. I told them very boldly,
[53:43] sir, I don't want to hear about the
[53:45] trinity.
[53:47] I'm not from you. I am from God.
[53:52] You keep your trinity doctrine with you.
[53:55] I don't want to stay in the Bible
[53:57] college anymore. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[54:00] Hallelujah.
[54:02] Okay. Thus, the message came to me. And
[54:06] then when I got married
[54:08] 1997, one of my brother-in-law, his name
[54:12] is John Nestley. Uh so he came to me, he
[54:16] came to my house because my wife is his
[54:19] sister, cousin sister. He came to me. So
[54:23] slowly he began to talking about these
[54:25] things about the baptism, Godhead. So I
[54:29] said, "Do you know William Renham?" I
[54:32] asked him. He said yes I know him.
[54:36] He
[54:38] said not only knowing already baptized.
[54:43] I already has baptized. I said somewhere
[54:47] in the Bible as I read these books sir.
[54:50] So slowly he encouraged me to take the
[54:54] baptism.
[54:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The inoculation
[54:59] started working in me.
[55:02] Amen. So many you know some of the
[55:05] denomination people they approached me
[55:07] they they asked me why don't you join
[55:10] with me group we will give you a good
[55:13] salary we will build your church we will
[55:16] help you monthly I said no sir I am a
[55:21] message believer
[55:25] I'm end time message believer
[55:28] I don't mingle with you anymore
[55:32] Amen. Hallelujah.
[55:34] So now like that I have started my
[55:37] ministry.
[55:39] You know I have started my ministry like
[55:42] that. So there was so many troubles and
[55:46] so many temptations
[55:48] came to
[55:49] me. Slowly I began to I began to avoid
[55:55] myself from the message people
[55:59] because
[56:01] something come to
[56:04] me. I started scared about the P
[56:08] message slowly my life is going
[56:12] down because uh if I want to speak this
[56:17] message in the public you know people
[56:20] will get offended. So I said I said I
[56:24] said to myself okay it's better to keep
[56:27] this
[56:28] doctrine keep this message inside in the
[56:31] outside I can say okay I'm also work
[56:35] with you like that after 10 years after
[56:39] I did the same thing 10 years brother 10
[56:43] years because I was not there to say
[56:47] this is the message this is the
[56:50] messenger this is malaki before I
[56:53] believe this. I came out of that
[56:54] denomination. I did not say that.
[56:58] So after 10 years, one
[57:00] day a sister asked my
[57:05] wife, you are not message
[57:09] people. You are not in the message.
[57:13] You will lose your rapture
[57:15] because you are mingling with the
[57:17] denominational people. It is not good
[57:20] for you.
[57:21] So something discussion was taking place
[57:24] like that. So my wife came to me one one
[57:28] morning after we finished our prayer. My
[57:31] wife started asking
[57:33] me you please tell me do we do we have
[57:38] rapture because that sister told me that
[57:42] we will miss the rapture because we are
[57:43] not following the message. What
[57:46] happened? I said what she says what she
[57:50] said is right because we are not living
[57:52] according to the
[57:54] message because we are mingling with the
[57:57] denominational people.
[58:00] She said why it happened like
[58:03] this? We want the kingdom of God. We
[58:05] don't want we don't want this kind of
[58:08] world. Amen. We don't want money. We
[58:11] don't want fame. We don't want nothing.
[58:13] We want only the kingdom of God. Yes.
[58:17] Hallelujah. So 10 years I am away from
[58:21] the message.
[58:23] But when the inoculation came to me,
[58:27] praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[58:30] Amen. My muscles began to get strength.
[58:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Amen. You
[58:37] know I told my wife I told my wife you
[58:39] know if you want the message to message
[58:44] life we must forshake all
[58:48] we must forsake friendship we must
[58:51] forshake everything. Hallelujah. That is
[58:55] the time a message came to me for
[58:58] shaking God.
[59:00] And one more message has touching my
[59:02] heart. What is that? God's word calls
[59:06] for a total
[59:08] separation.
[59:10] Hallelujah.
[59:11] So those two books help me a lot and I
[59:15] told my wife from hereafter we live for
[59:18] only for the message.
[59:21] Whatever it comes whatever it goes.
[59:23] Amen. We don't worry about it. Because
[59:26] the in inoculation came to me. Praise
[59:30] the Lord. Hallelujah.
[59:31] God strengthened my heart and I I went
[59:34] to the church and I told the church I
[59:36] told her from hereafter I will preach
[59:39] about the message.
[59:42] Hallelujah. Amen. I will tell about the
[59:45] malach. Amen. If you want come and sit
[59:48] listen it is okay. If you don't want you
[59:51] can better uh go from the church.
[59:55] Hallelujah. Amen. By God's grace, one or
[59:59] two families left the church, but
[1:00:01] remaining all they stayed with me.
[1:00:05] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:00:08] Then I began to preach the message. Yes.
[1:00:12] And that was the year I called brother
[1:00:15] Mark for the meetings. Brother Mark, he
[1:00:18] was he was surprised. Hey Warun, how did
[1:00:21] you come to this message again? And I
[1:00:24] said God visited me. Hallelujah. God has
[1:00:29] visited me. Hallelujah. So that
[1:00:33] inoculation came again into my life. I
[1:00:36] began to get the strength and began to
[1:00:39] speak about the message in the public.
[1:00:42] Hallelujah. When I was weak, I did not
[1:00:45] open my mouth. But when God strengthened
[1:00:48] me, I began to speak of the mystery.
[1:00:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So what I'm
[1:00:56] trying to tell is you our bacteria good
[1:01:00] bacteria will give us strength to live
[1:01:03] message life. Hallelujah. From after
[1:01:07] that my life totally changed my message
[1:01:11] changed my family changed. We only
[1:01:15] dedicate ourselves for the message
[1:01:17] itself. I told my congregation if you
[1:01:21] want stay with me you can stay if you
[1:01:23] want go from the church you can go out
[1:01:26] but as for me and my family we follow
[1:01:28] the message
[1:01:31] hallelujah
[1:01:32] so when the real bacteria working in our
[1:01:36] life we will be very strong hallelujah
[1:01:40] sir this is my example my life
[1:01:43] hallelujah so we can say there are many
[1:01:46] people in the bible
[1:01:48] Who got the inoculation?
[1:01:50] Who got the good bacteria?
[1:01:53] When we go to Bible uh book of Acts
[1:01:56] chapter 10 verse 38 where it says God
[1:02:00] anointed Jesus of Nazareth. Yes. He went
[1:02:03] out and do good. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:02:07] Because he was inoculated by the power
[1:02:10] of God. He he got the good bacteria.
[1:02:14] That's why he went out and he does the
[1:02:17] good to the people. Because there are
[1:02:20] many people who got the good bacteria
[1:02:22] and they did good to people. What I'm
[1:02:25] trying to say is if you have the bad
[1:02:28] bacteria, you will spoil the people. He
[1:02:31] will spoil the congregation. He will
[1:02:33] spoil your testimony. He will spoil your
[1:02:35] family. But if you got the good
[1:02:38] bacteria,
[1:02:40] he will strengthen the people. He will
[1:02:42] bring the people to the message. He will
[1:02:45] be a blessing from the church.
[1:02:48] Hallelujah. So we need to receive good
[1:02:52] bacteria. It is nothing but the message.
[1:02:56] The good bacteria will give you the
[1:02:58] strength to overcome every kind of
[1:03:01] sickness to overcome every kind of weak
[1:03:05] faith. The good bacteria will strengthen
[1:03:08] you. It will not allow you to fall down.
[1:03:10] Yeah, it will keep you from all kinds of
[1:03:13] temptations.
[1:03:15] I just want to encourage you brother,
[1:03:17] sister. You have to receive the good
[1:03:20] bacteria.
[1:03:21] You have to inoculate by the power of
[1:03:23] God. So that your body, your spirit and
[1:03:27] your soul will be preserved by the power
[1:03:30] of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you
[1:03:34] understand me? Hallelujah. So we need a
[1:03:38] good bacteria. Yes. Hallelujah. There
[1:03:40] are some bad bacteries in the Bible, you
[1:03:43] know. You know, Korak, Dan, they're they
[1:03:47] got the bad bacteria. What happened?
[1:03:50] They went out and they spoiled the
[1:03:52] church. They spoiled the ministry.
[1:03:56] They they stood against the man of God.
[1:03:59] They talking they talked against the man
[1:04:01] of God. They ministered the man of God
[1:04:04] because they got the bad bacteria. Is
[1:04:07] it? Yeah. Hallelujah. So there are many
[1:04:10] people like that. But I just want to
[1:04:13] tell you there are good people, good
[1:04:16] bacteria. Hallelujah. The Bible says a
[1:04:20] good man will bring good things out of
[1:04:22] him. A bad man will bring bad things out
[1:04:25] of him. Hallelujah. So we need to bring
[1:04:29] good things. That means we need to be
[1:04:31] inoculated by good bacteria.
[1:04:34] May God bless this.
[1:04:37] God bless you. Hallelujah.
[1:04:43] Thank you, sir. Amen.
[1:04:46] Amen. God bless you. God bless you.
[1:04:50] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:53] Hallelujah. Amen. How many of you got
[1:04:55] the good bacteria? Amen. How many if you
[1:04:57] want to read where the bacteria came
[1:04:59] into the church? Put up Revelation 10:8
[1:05:02] there. Amen. Let's read it.
[1:05:04] bacteria coming into the church. That's
[1:05:07] right. And the voice which I heard from
[1:05:09] heaven spake unto me again and said, "Go
[1:05:11] and take the little book which is open
[1:05:14] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:05:16] upon the sea and upon the earth." And I
[1:05:19] went unto the angel and said unto him,
[1:05:22] Give me the little book. And he said
[1:05:24] unto me, "Take it, eat it up, and it
[1:05:28] shall make thy belly bitter, but it
[1:05:30] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey."
[1:05:36] Good bacteria coming into the church.
[1:05:38] Amen. Amen. One more verse there. Two
[1:05:40] more. And I took the little book out of
[1:05:43] the angel's hand and ate it up. Yes. And
[1:05:45] it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And
[1:05:47] as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was
[1:05:50] bitter. Now, we don't eat anything.
[1:05:52] There must be expression of life.
[1:05:54] Anything we eat, digest and it goes into
[1:05:57] the bloodstream.
[1:05:59] Now we got to And he said unto me, "Thou
[1:06:01] must prophesy again before many peoples,
[1:06:04] nations, and tongues, and kings." So we
[1:06:08] are what we eat. Let's give the Lord a
[1:06:10] good acclaim one more time. Amen. Let's
[1:06:12] thank God as we worship him. Praise the

[1:13:17] feeding on. How many if you want to say,
[1:13:19] "Lord, I want to be the temple of the

[1:14:01] for an outpouring of his spirit. And not
[1:14:04] just an outpouring, but a refilling.
[1:14:06] Hallelujah. The prophet says the
[1:14:08] dynamics of this church is a refilling
[1:14:10] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:13] So maybe you want a fresh anointing, a
[1:14:14] fresh touch. Say, Lord, this evening,
[1:14:17] send a new touch of fire in my soul.
[1:14:20] Amen. Jesus. Thank you. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:25] Glory be to your name, Jesus. Worthy to

[1:14:41] star. You are the king of our lives.
[1:14:46] Lord God, you are the
[1:14:48] inoculation that is needed at this end
[1:14:51] time. Lord God, as your word would tell
[1:14:54] us, those that walk after uh after the
[1:14:57] flesh are connally and those that walk
[1:15:01] after the spirit, I believe, Lord God,
[1:15:04] are feasting on a seven course meal,
[1:15:07] Lord God, they are feeding on spiritual
[1:15:10] food in due season. Lord God, that's the
[1:15:13] inoculation that is needed. We cannot
[1:15:16] find outside. We cannot find it in the
[1:15:19] denominations. We cannot find it. Amen.
[1:15:22] Hallelujah. Amen. In some movement uh
[1:15:25] but it's a relationship with one God uh
[1:15:28] that has come to manifest himself in the
[1:15:31] flesh God to come because you have
[1:15:34] promised they will be a people without
[1:15:37] spot without wrinkle. They will walk in
[1:15:40] the word for they will be the light of
[1:15:42] the world. And oh God, that inoculation
[1:15:46] takes filthy garments away. Take sinful
[1:15:49] people and make them Amen. vessels of
[1:15:53] honor.

[1:16:04] he promised you stand at the door and
[1:16:07] knock. If any man, oh my can open up, I
[1:16:12] will come in. I will inoculate you. I
[1:16:15] will make you pure. I will make you
[1:16:17] virgin again. I will make you a vessel
[1:16:21] that Lord God you can use.
[1:16:24] Forgive your people's sin, Lord God,
[1:16:26] this evening. Uh Lord God, when Jonah
[1:16:29] went down uh right there, Lord, he
